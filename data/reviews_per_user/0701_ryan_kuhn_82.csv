The Rock," 'Define combat, sir.'
","Rarely do I find a movie where logic takes a back seat that I actually enjoy. The Rock is one of those dumb action movies that I did find enjoyable. Nicholas Cage has turned out to be quite the action actor, able to sustain a borderline-nerd character into a kick ass James Bond-esquire action star (Stanley Goodspeed is his name in the movie). Not bad, especially since he's staring in the same movie as James Bond himself, Sean Connery. The Connery character is actually intriguing. He plays John Mason, an ex-British spy who's been locked up by the FBI for years, holding him without ever charging him on anything. We find out later that he found out buried secrets about America's past, so the FBI had to silence him before he spoke. The only problem with that plan is they put Mason in Alcatraz, and Mason became, at least according to the movie's plot, the only resident of the prison to escape. Fast forward to the movie's present day, and a team of Marines, lead by Ed Harris, have stolen VX gas (real stuff, highly poisonous stuff too) and are threatening to launch missiles filled with the gas from Alcatraz over San Francisco. The plan is to have navy seals enter Alcatraz, with help from Mason, and disable the missiles, with help from Goodspeed. The movie plays like a cat and mouse game between the good guys and the bad guys through the bowels of the prison, ultimately ending in grand fashion. The movie is well paced, director Michael Bay knows just when to slow down the pace and when to speed it back up. The special effects and the acting are solid, especially by Harris who plays a tough guy Marine until the moment of truth approaches. The Rock is solid entertainment, even if you have to shut your brain off at times.",7,3,3,29 April 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," 'You and I Have Unfinished Business.'
","I let this movie soak into my conscience for a day or so before I began to break it down. At first, I was a tad disappointed in this follow up to 2003's Kill Bill, Vol. 1, not a prequel to this sequel, rather the first half of the story. It turned out rather that Volume 1 was the appetizer to the main course that is Volume 2. If you recall, Volume 1 finds Uma Thurman's annoyingly unnamed Bride waking from a coma after her former boss and love interest Bill has her wedding party whacked by a gang of killers. By the end of the first volume, 2 of the 4 Bill underlings had been disposed of, leaving the Bride to exact her revenge against Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and Bill's current lover, the one-eyed Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah in super-bitch overdrive, a tasty character to be sure). Poor Budd had given up the world of murder for hire to become the under-appreciated bouncer at a California strip joint when the Bride re-enters his life, but he still has a knack for finding the 'right' way of taking care of his former business. What he does to a captured foe is down right frightening for those who are claustrophobic or have a deep down fear of pre-mature burial. Elle on the other hand is calculating, cold, unwavering as she maneuvers herself through a transaction that leaves her on the winning end of the deal ultimately. Her battle with The Bride (where we finally learn her name, and the buildup really isn't that payoff we were looking for, but perhaps that was the point) is a Jerry Springer Show watcher's dream, two good looking blondes fighting it out in a trailer in the middle of nowhere. The outcome of that battle is ironic and leaves the viewer guessing what happens after the camera leaves the trailer. The ultimate scenes between the Bride and Bill are heartbreaking. Who would have guessed a movie with Quentin Tarantino, where nothing is to be taken seriously, has a genuine heart tugging set of events to end the film. Bill is played wonderfully by David Carridine, a man who knows who he is ('A murdering bastard'), knows how to raise the daughter of a woman he tried to kill (The Bride's daughter, THE source of the emotional conflict at the end of the movie), and even knows why he likes Superman over the other comic book hero's. Some people have complained that the ultimate scene was a bit of a letdown, and after the ballet of sword and fake blood that was the Bride-Crazy 88's battle in Volume 1, anything is quieter and slower and more poignant than that, and that's what Tarantino gives us here. There are no surprises to the plot of the movie as the story goes, but Volume 2 does fill in the holes on what happened, why everything happened the way they did, and how it made each character feel. The Bride is a warrior of zero emotion in Volume 1, the total opposite here in Volume 2. Tarantino goes from the far East film experience in Volume 1 to a Sergio Leone Western film in Volume 2 with sweeping landscapes, music featuring both guitars and trumpets (in fact, most of the most important songs are directly from A Fist Full of Dollars and other Leone movies), snakes and dirt and a dash for cash, all of which Clint Eastwood would feel at home in. The only thing I found askew when it came to Volume 2 was how complete it is compared to Volume 1. The credits give this away. Tarantino dips into the 1940s style of credits with fancy script fonts and the gray scale background, and even the opening music reminded me of something one would here at the beginning of a 1930s film. This is not a negative, but it just makes Volume 1 now feel like something to warm the audience up with, then the real meal comes with Volume 2. The credits go on for about 15 minutes and features a montage of all of the important characters in the movie, much like the end of the Super Mario Brothers video games, when you beat the game, the show you everyone you defeated to win it all. I don't know if Tarantino had that in mind when piecing it together, but it worked for me. After the day of playing the movie again through my mind, I found this movie much more satisfying than the first one. The story, the pace, the dialogue, all much slower, and slower is often better. The energy that is shown in Volume 1 is thrown away here, and the movie is much better for it. I personally think putting the two films back together would be risky. The styles are so different, the pace is so different between the two volumes, I don't know if I would enjoy a complete film as much as I do now as two separate pieces. Kill Bill, Volume 2 is a success from the story, the visuals, the music, and the actors all working as one, as the ultimate snake charmer, Tarantino, puts it all together.",10,0,1,13 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'Hard to see, the dark side is.'
","Since 1999, when The Phantom Menace became the first new Star Wars movie in 16 years, there has been much bemoaning by Star Wars fans about how this movie, as well as Episode II: Attack of the Clones, ruined the Star Wars franchise. I shared similar thoughts, but after watching both movies recently, they may not be on the same playing field as Empire Strikes Back, but you cannot tell me that it is any worse than Return of the Jedi. The Phantom Menace may have Jar Jar Binks, but at least it doesn't have any Ewoks. The Phantom Menace is a visionary wonder, ushering in the digital revolution that has been the impossible now routine in movies. Entire characters, cities, space battles were designed and executed on computers here in breathtaking beauty. The complaints about the Star Wars 'prequels,' as Episodes I and II have become known as, have not been over special effects. The outcry with these films have been the story. Sure, I wish more had happened to get Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) closer to becoming Darth Vader in this movie, but we did see the meeting between Obi-Wan Kenobi (the very good Ewan McGregor, he sounds so much like a young Alec Guinness, it's scary), we do get to see some outstanding light sabre battles between Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Darth Maul (Ray Park), and the eternal scheming by the future Emporer, here only a Senator, Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Yes, Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) is in this movie, but he's no more annoying than the Ewoks were. The movie is a solid one. And since it's the first chapter of a story, even those not familiar with the Star Wars saga can enjoy it. The pod race sequence is visually wonderful, and there are some real human emotions that do make their way into The Phantom Menace. Any one who goes away to college can sympathize with Anakin as he leaves his mother to become a Jedi. For the bashers out there, get off your high horse, step back and look at The Phantom Menace again and try to enjoy it. You never know, you may end up liking it.",8,0,1,30 April 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," 'At least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time...'
","Steven Spielberg was supposed to direct Return of the Jedi, but Hollywood politics intervened, and instead, we got the Ewoks. OK, the Ewoks were probably going to be in the movie whether Spielberg was involved with the movie or not, but the weakest of the original Star Wars movies is one of those 'What if?' moments, as I think about how the saga could have ended if the visionary director was involved. The primary reason for this thinking is that just two years before the release of Jedi was Raiders of the Lost Ark, a collaboration between George Lucas and Spielberg. The story goes that Lucas and Spielberg were trying to come up with a story for a James Bond movie when it looked like they were going to have a crack at the franchise. Unfortunately for them, the Bond people went a different direction, allowing Lucas and Spielberg to use some of the ideas they had in their mind to come up with the character 'Indiana Jones,' a swashbuckling archaeologist who escapes the inescapable situations, restores truth and order, and gets the girl in the end. The movie Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first of three adventures following Indy around the world, and the movie that features the best of Indy's girlfriends. Fresh off his Han Solo success, Harrison Ford fell into the role of Jones, as Tom Sellick was originally tapped to play the role. The movie is a series of adventures, ranging from the jungles of South America (who hasn't seen the big ball rolling toward Indiana Jones), to the mountains of Nepal, finally ending the deserts of Egypt. Karen Allen plays Marion, a former lover of Indy's, one that has been jilted in the past. We get the feeling the first time we see Marion and Indy in the Nepal bar that Indiana is the type that has trouble keeping girlfriends, and Marion is the only one he could possibly be with. The movie revolves around Indiana trying to find the fabled Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do, as Hitler wants to use the power of the Ark to win his conquest of the world. Breathtaking adventures, fantastic chase sequences, and a wry sense of humor (the scene where Indiana beats his sword carrying adversary is one of the biggest laughs in any movie I can think of) makes Raiders of the Lost Ark an adventure film that holds even to this day. When the movie ended, I was disappointed that it was over, as I wanted the adventure to continue. It did, later in the decade, with two sequels, with plans for the fourth edition to come out in 2008.",9,0,0,2 October 2006
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," I Want To Meet Goofy!
","Imagine a world where Bugs Bunny was your next door neighbor and Mickey Mouse came to one of your parties. That is the magical world of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a remarkable movie, not only in the visual achievement of the film, but also it stars both Disney and Looney Toon characters. Produced by Steven Spielberg, rights owned by Buena Vista (part of the Disney empire), and directed by Robert Zemeckis, there is a lot of talent involved with this melding of live action and cartoon characters. This, of course, is not the first melding of people and cartoon, one just has to look back at Mary Poppins, but this is the most advanced convergence of real life and cartoon life. The story involves a cartoon rabbit actor, Roger, who is accused of murder. Before Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) took over Toontown (where all of the cartoon characters live, a town that looks like it came out of a child's nightmare), there was no way to kill a cartoon character. But Doom found a way to administer capital punishment for his citizens (by using paint thinner, or course) and Roger is on the lam. He finds aid in a drunk detective (Ed Hoskins) who spiraled down from the heights of the business after a cartoon killed his partner, his brother. The movie features the sexiest cartoon character since Betty Boop, who is also in the movie, in Jessica Rabbit, married to Roger. Why would she marry Roger Rabbit? Easy, he makes her laugh. The story is a pretty standard 'whodunnit' movie, but the movie itself is much much more than that. Such a creative merge of hardboiled detective story and cartoons of the 1940s is a joy to watch. And the end of the movie discusses the zany ideas of 'strip malls' and 'free ways' in such a way to bring out some of the biggest laughs of the movie. A trailblazing movie is entertaining to a point, Who Framed Roger Rabbit has the plot to keep the viewer interested throughout the entire picture.",8,1,1,13 February 2005
Minority Report," Everybody Runs...
","The future, we are told, are what we make of it. Philip K. Dick did not want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3 scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a 'Whodunnit?' and a futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film. The most interesting design is of the 'sick sticks' used by cops to bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan.",9,127,159,13 February 2005
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Monty Python and the Search for Religion
","The British comedy troupe Monty Python had always been on the edge of controversy ever since their show 'Flying Circus' appeared on the BBC in the late 1960s, but nothing had prepared the world for what Life of Brian had brought. In Life of Brian, the comedians go after the one institution that has always had trouble accepting satire: religion, specifically the Christian Church. Seen as blasphemous, Life of Brian needed an eleventh hour rescue for Beatle George Harrison to finish the film. The church was wise to wonder what the Pythons were doing. Life of Brian is filled with questions of the role of religion in society, why people often feel they need religion, and the age old question of 'What would happen if the 3 wise men went to the wrong stable on that night they brought gifts to the young savior?' There is typical Python silliness throughout the movie, set up early where listeners at one of Jesus' sermons (held at 'tea time,' of course) think they hear that 'blessed are the cheese makers.' But the most important part of this film, and it's charm, are the questions of religion. No matter your faith, you will find scenes in Life of Brian unsettling, provocative, and humorous, possibly all three at once. While not wall-to-wall as funny as Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian is a humorous look at civilization's oldest and dearest institutions, and asks us to consider what we are doing.",7,11,24,13 February 2005
Meet the Parents," Fearing Papa De Niro
","For a man, there is nothing worse than meeting your woman's father. Fear and trepidation do not even begin to describe what it's like to meet the father. And nothing can prepare any man for meeting your girlfriend's father when he is Robert de Niro. This is the main problem Ben Stiller's character faces in the 2000 surprise comedy Meet The Parents. Stiller plays a male nurse with the unfortunate name of Greg Focker, dating pre-school teacher Pam Byrnes played by Teri Polo. Pam's sister is getting married back in her native Long Island, so a weekend trip is in store for the happy couple. After losing his luggage and being spit up on my a baby, Greg meets the man of the house Jack Byrnes (de Niro). Through various misunderstandings and lying to cover up the misunderstandings, Greg begins to fall out of favor with Jack. Stiller has a wonderful knack of displaying insecurity, and that severs him well in Meet the Parents. He knows he is not living up to the standards of Jack, especially when he meets Pam's former fiancé, played by Owen Wilson. The more uncomfortable Greg is, the more he squirms, the more he lies, and the deeper he gets. The final scenes are great, especially the one dealing with the airline workers who are on autopilot, and poor Greg almost causes an international incident. The movie is cute, has plenty of laughs, and puts most men into a situation they can relate to, and fear more than an all-day Oprah marathon.",7,1,2,13 February 2005
Unbreakable," 'Do you remember me ever being sick?'
","I was never a big fan of comic books, but I do appreciate the style and storytelling that goes into them. My favorite show growing up was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, based on a comic book, in which each episode our heroes face their enemies, but nothing is ever decided. Comic books are about episodes of action where nothing is ever ultimately decided. The 2000 movie by M. Night Shyamalan, his first movie after his surprise smash The Sixth Sense, plays as the first edition of a comic book, where the hero is immune to all ailments and broken bones and a lurking villain who is his opposite. The movie is all about discovery, as Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, the lone survivor of a railway accident. Soon after, Dunn is invited to see a comic book collector, Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who is brittle and always sick. Jackson figures if there is one man as weak as he, there has to be a strong man who is unbreakable, and he thinks it is Dunn. The meat of the movie deals with Dunn trying to come to grips with the prospect of near-invincibility and ability to 'see' evil before it happens. The end of the movie is Dunn seeing for himself if he has the power, we learn his weakness, then we find out what the entire movie was about. My only complaint to the end of the movie, I really liked the final relationship between Price and Dunn, is how Shyamalan finished the movie. For those who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about, the final shot is of words super-imposed on the screen telling the audience what happened after the film ends. I did not want that. I loved how the movie served as a first edition of a series, but the words on the screen make it a one-episode series. Nothing in comic books is supposed to be resolved as quickly as it is in Unbreakable. That annoyed me, almost as much as the son of David Dunn, played by Spencer Treat Clark, who was annoying in Gladiator as well. For the most part, Unbreakable is a great movie, and is a great movie if you hit the 'Stop' button on your DVD player just as Bruce Willis walks off the screen in the final scene.",8,7,11,13 February 2005
Memento," 'Now... where was I?'
","Christopher Nolan gives us two things to think about with Memento. One is what would it be like if you couldn't remember what you did 5 minutes ago. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby who lost his ability to hold on to short term memory after an altercation in his home, where his wife was murdered. Ever since then, Shelby has been trying to track down the murder of his wife, armed with a Poleroid Camera and a pen to tattoo his body with important notes, jotting down notes before he forgets what to write down. Nolan also complicates matters (or challenges the audience) by telling the story backwards, we see the last scene first, and the first scene of the movie, if told linearly, last. This adds mystery to an intriguing story, as we find out things about the characters after we see how they react. Between the scenes, we watch Shelby talk on the phone, to who we don't know, but it fill us in on his disorder and how much he remembers before his accident. Leonard Shelby lives like he died one day, and he sleeps walk through the rest of his life. Joe Pantoliano plays an auto mechanic who may or may not be helping Shelby through his ordeals, and Carrie-Anne Moss plays a woman who may or may not be helping Shelby as well. Much like a Tarantino film, the time warping used by Memento is a gimmick that actually enhances the story. While we see what happened last first, the story, what we are shown, works linearly, the climax of the story would be the first scene in the movie, but here, it's last and fits in much better. The filler material that we see between action sequences adds depth to the emotional torture Shelby goes through. Pearce plays Shelby very well, acting confused when he should be confused, the film never takes shortcuts. For once, the audience knows just as much about everything as the main character does, putting the audience on an even level as the character, we're not going to hear him say something just out of the blue. We all try to put the pieces together, and that puts us in the movie. Just like the Seinfeld episode that was backwards, you have to pay attention, we know where we are going, now, where were we?",9,1,3,13 February 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," 'What were you children doing in the wardrobe?'
","This movie joins the legion of films based on books I was supposed to read as a younger kid, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a solid adaptation of the CS Lewis novel. For this uninitiated viewer, I found aspects of other fantasy movies sprinkled in the story, with some elements of greater theology thrown in there for good measure. Tilda Swinton plays the evil White Witch (though we never find out how she becomes so powerful or how she recruits her followers) who proclaims herself the ruler of Narnia. The kingdom resides in the back of a wardrobe in an English countryside home where four children flee to during World War II's Battle of Britain bombardment of London. While trying to hide from the housekeeper, the children enter Narnia where they become entangled in the war between the white witch and animals of Narnia, lead by a lion named Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson). The kids, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) are used by the Witch to proclaim war against Aslan's forces, setting up a battle sequence right out of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies. The prodding by the White Witch reminded me of Darth Vader in the Star Wars movies, perhaps shedding light on the source material for George Lucas and his mythology. There is also an undeniable religious slant to the pivotal Aslan scenes, as the parallels between Aslan and Christ cannot be overlooked. It's not a bad thing, and critical viewing of this movie could be used to discuss stories of the Bible without overtly discussing potentially dicey topics. Overall, the movie is entertaining, though a tad long, I thought some scenes could have been trimmed, allowing the story to flow better. The beavers (voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French) are not only funny and bring some levity to an otherwise heavy movie, but the animation is top-notch, producing believable beaver tour guides for the characters and viewers. Lovers of the book will like this movie, while other viewers may be entertained in the levels of mythology featured in the movie and their relations to theology.",7,0,0,2 January 2006
Happy Gilmore," 'Somebody's Closer!'
","When you buy an Adam Sandler movie, you're buying a brand, usually you know what you're going to get. Simple humor, occasionally funny voices, a regular guy doing something great, either on a big stage event, or merely passing high school. Happy Gilmore may be the most consistently funny of the Adam Sandler movies as a failed hockey player finds out he can hit a golf ball 350 yards and tries to earn enough money to buy back his beloved grandmother's house from the IRS. Simple plot, surrounded by funny performances from Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed from the Rocky movies) as golf teacher Chubbs and Christopher McDonald as the smug professional golfer Shooter McGavin. And just for fun, Lee Trevino makes brief, and funny, appearances throughout the film. The signature scene of the film is when Happy Gilmore (Sandler) plays golf with Bob Barker (yes, that Bob Barker from The Price Is Right) get into a fistfight over who is play golf well or not. It would have been in poor taste if Happy were to beat up Barker, but since it goes the other way around, it has a certain comic genius to it and saves what could have been an uncomfortable moment. The golf highlights are all long shots and fancy editing, Gimore slices almost every tee shot, but through the magic of movies, we don't see that happening. It's funny throughout the movie, not laugh out loud funny from start to finish, but there are a lot of chuckles, the story is cute, and it is not as crude as other Sandler movies are. It's sweet, cute, and most importantly, funny enough to maintain the entertainment value all the way through.",6,0,3,13 February 2005
Ed Wood," A Man of Conviction, If Not Talent
","Every young movie maker thinks he can do anything and everything that has not been done already. Ed Wood is no exception, and that is why he's so special. Often considered THE worst movie director of all time, his life story would have been interesting if he had not made Play 9 From Outer Space. Tim Burton's tribute to the writer/director of the 1940s and 50s chronicles Wood's life from studio 'lot boy' movie plants from one movie studio to another up to the premier of Plan 9. Along the way, we root for and feel sorry for Wood as he produces what he thinks are the ultimate pictures of all time, but we know they are turkeys. The charm of Ed Wood is how the director never questioned himself, how he always thought what he was doing was wonderful, and how everyone else got him wrong. The film features Martin Landau in an Oscar Winning Performance as the aging star of Dracula, Bela Legosi, and Bill Murray plays a make-up artist who really wants to be a woman. The real life characters that surround Wood make for almost constant comedy, and Burton's use of black and white gives us that feel of 1940s Hollywood. The background information we find in this movie gives us perspective in a man who was doing what he wanted to do in life, no matter what the results may have been.",9,0,0,13 February 2005
Ocean's Twelve," 'Come on, he's one guy, and he's French.'
","During the Summer of 2001, Ocean's Eleven, a remake, was unlike most remakes of the early 2000s. It was fresh, it was lively, it was fun to watch. Steven Soderbergh, who has directed some very heavy movies (Erin Brockovich, Traffic, Solaris) brought us two hours of con-man entertainment that had very little to do with the premise of the original Rat Pack film from the 1960s other than Danny Ocean led 10 other thieves to rip off a Vegas casino. The pace, the plot, and the fun I had while watching Ocean's Eleven made me want to see Ocean's Twelve very much, hoping this would be the movie that bucked the sequel trend of the 2000s. While I was not expecting Godfather II or The Empire Stikes Back, I was at least hoping for a serviceable sequel, one that at least kept the life and energy of the original flowing through the characters and the scenes of the movie. By now, you should be getting the feeling I didn't feel it from this sequel. While Ocean's Twelve is not a bad movie, it just does not live up its predecessor's. Perhaps it was the genius of the fun little movie Ocean's Eleven that this movie just looks so different and less entertaining. Ocean's Twelve's first mistake? They make the good guys losers in the first scenes. Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who had $160 million stolen from him in the first movie by the band of 11, finds out who stole the money and gives them 2 weeks to return the dough, plus interest, or it's 'game over.' This gives the movie makers and excuse to send the crew to Europe, to new fancy locales with new music and characters to meet. The plot is unimportant, as it just serves to allow each character a chance to scheme and plot some impossible scenario, and the acting is solid. George Clooney knows more than he's letting on as Danny Ocean, Brad Pitt knows even more than Ocean as Rusty Ryan, Bernie Mac likes his nail salons as Frank Catten, Matt Damon shows a nice comedic touch as Linus Caldwell, and, well, I could go on about the cast, but I wont. The newest additions to the cast are Catherine Zeta-Jones as an international thief expert and Andrew Cassel as the Night Fox, the designated bad-guy in the film. His motivations are juvenile but keeps the plot moving. The ending is border-line confusing, as the ultimate motivation for everything in the movie becomes clear only after the last scene of the movie, or possibly after a repeat viewing. As I said, this is not a bad movie, especially for those who enjoy a good caper movie, but perhaps the overreaching breadth of the movie made it difficult to capture the fun little moments of Ocean's Eleven, or allow much humor, or allow the banter we saw in the 2001 movie. Maybe it was the different tone of the movie, but those who loved 2001's Ocean's Eleven may see something good in Ocena's Twelve--though don't expect a great time.",6,0,0,1 February 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The darkest comedy ever
","One of the worst things to ever happen to Hollywood was the end of the Cold War, and looking back at a movie like Dr. Strangelove reminds us of the fearful, sober, overall silliness that was the tensions between the Soviets and the Americans. During the 40 years or so that the two super powers threatened each other's destruction, movies had always exploited the fears of the movie-goer to create suspense that often was 'too real.' Dr. Strangelove is the darkest of the black comedies about the Cold War, and the source of the humor comes from how real it is. Examine one of the classic scenes from the movie. What would be the first words between the American President and the Soviet Premier when nuclear war is about to start? Thanks to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, we have an answer that looks ridiculous, but may be as real as anything else in movies. Or look at the George C. Scott character. As the head of the Air Force, he gleefully announces that an all out attack on the Soviets would only result in the 'death of 10-20 million civilians, depending on the breaks', of course. There are a few weaknesses to the movie in the way of time issues (is it 3 am or 3 pm?), but those are only minor quibbles. This may be my favorite movie, a comedy about the end of the world. We are able to laugh at the circumstances that lead to the end of civilization, which also scares the hell out of us. What if these are the people running our country, with their finger on the button? Even now, with the Cold War over, this movie resonates with the viewer, showing us how silly the competition was in the Cole War (By the end of the movie, there's concern over a 'Mine Shaft Gap') and how the leaders who controlled the fate of a planet may not have been the right men for the job.",10,1,3,13 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," 'Obi-Wan has taught you well...'
","The final chapter of the Star Wars saga, Return of the Jedi has a difficult job: wrap up most story lines, produce one final epic battle sequence, and go much deeper into the mythology that is the force. The movie accomplishes each of those tasks fine, and though unfair, when comparing 'Jedi' versus the other two films, it's the weakest. That's not to say it's a poor film, to the contrary it is still most entertaining, but the slow pace to the beginning of the movie takes away from the high energy that 'Empire Strikes Back' ends on. If you'll recall, at the end of 'Empire,' our heroes Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando, and the droids are searching for Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who is being held by the gangster Jabba the Hutt. That's the warm up to the movie, the story line continuing Luke and Darth Vader is much more interesting and leads to the ultimate end of the movie and saga. One of my favorite scenes in all of movies comes at the end of 'Jedi,' the final battle between Luke and Darth Vader, long-shots, big music, sends chills up my spine. The movie was intended to be directed by George Lucas' friend Steven Spielberg, but a union technicality nixed that idea, and little known Welsh-born director Richard Marquand does the job. We also get to see the sinister Emporer, played by Ian McDiarmid under layers and layers of makeup, he adds another piece to the force puzzle. Then there are the ewoks, those cute little made-for-merchandising furry creatures that occupy the middle of the movie. They're cute, but after the dark, adult themes of 'Empire,' the ewoks evokes a kiddy charm that takes away from the maturity level of the Star Wars movies. I would have liked to see a planet of wookies over a planet of ewoks, but what do I know? A movie of power scenes, with silly ewoks in the middle, Return of the Jedi is a satisfactory and entertaining end to the Star Wars saga.",8,0,1,13 February 2005
Alien," One Alien Is Plenty
","The Alien saga began with the best one, when there was only one Alien to be seen. The simplicity of the story is the key. One Alien, one claustrophobic ship, and 7 crew-members are the entire cast of this 1979 thriller. Directed by Ridley Scott, Alien has a sense of unease, a fear of what will happen next. The setup to the movie is wonderful, scary looking beings that we have never seen before invade our minds, we only catch quick looks off the actual being, mostly when it's young and popping out of John Hurt's stomach, in the most gruesome, yet famous scene of the movie. Sigorney Weaver plays Ripley, a rare female hero in a science fiction movie. She is a strong character, one cunning enough to ultimately defeat the Alien creature at the end of the movie. But the most important part of the movie is the suspense, mostly in what we don't see. As I said, we do not see much of the actual Alien creature. In the most tension filled scene, the Alien is not seen, just a dot on a computer screen chasing down another dot is all that gets the audience to fear it. Dark, claustrophobic, and selective of what we see, Scott does a great job of giving the audience what he wants us to see, not everything we need to see. The simplicity in the story is what makes it a gem.",9,0,1,13 February 2005
The Polar Express," 'Sometimes the most real things in this world are the things we can't see.'
","The Polar Express is a beautiful movie based on the children's picture book of the same name. As wonderful as the paintings that occupy the book are, the movie looks just as good. The movie follows a young boy who finds out on Christmas Eve that he will be going to the North Pole to watch Santa take off on his worldwide trip to gift giving. He had doubts that he will see Santa at all, but goes on the trip and meets up with a know-it-all kid with a terribly annoying voice (voiced by Eddie Deezen) and a girl who has a song in her heart (voiced by Nona Gaye) on a train that goes directly to the North Pole. The Arctic Outback provides the backdrop for the train ride, as we see quiet forests, howling wolves, and interesting terrain that supplies most of the suspense in this movie. The most daring part of the movie comes when the train goes through a roller coaster of tracks, ending by skating across a glacier. This scene is a wonder to watch, expertly crafted by director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future movies), though may scare a few of the young ones out there. Tom Hanks supplies the voices to six characters, including the train conductor, Santa Claus, a hobo riding on the train, and the young boy in which the story revolves. The movie was made by capturing the movements of the actors and running those movements into computers that animated the movie action. The final scenes of the movie take place in the North Pole, where the viewer will see more elves than they may ever want to admit to. The story of the movie is as simple as the book that it is based on, but is still fun to watch. Adults will like the simple story with a positive message, and kids will like the pretty scenes and the subject matter, though some of the perilous situations could scare a few kids. A holiday classic for years to come.",7,1,4,30 November 2005
Elf," 'You sit on a throne of lies!'
","Will Ferrell is a pure performer, everything he does, he goes head-first into. I didn't love him in Old School, though many many many other did love the over-the-top 37 year old college kid, but I did admire his enthusiasm for the role and his commitment to make it funny. His shtick works much better for me here in Elf, the story of a 6'4' elf named Buddy in Santa's workshop, twice as big as his fellow workers, though not twice as productive. His size hurts his ability to work hard, eventually leading to Papa Elf (the always devastatingly understated Bob Newhart) to tell Buddy that his father is a real human from New York, and Buddy came to the North Pole by accident. After leaving the Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer-esquire North Pole for New York. The childish naiveté of Buddy in the corporate world of business New York at Christmas time gets him into trouble, first with a department store Santa (Artie Lange from the Howard Stern show) then with an children's author who is said to have sold more books than Dr. Seuss, the surly Miles Finch (Peter Dinklage). James Caan plays Buddy's real father, he has the difficult job of playing straight man to Will Ferrell while convincing us that he really does think his son worked for Santa Claus. Mary Steenbrugen is Caan's wife, a woman who takes to Buddy right away and does not question where he came from and how he knows her husband. And then there is Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), a department store clerk who falls for Buddy, even though he sounds like a 14 year old, but somehow that wins her over. There is a lot to Elf that can be dismissed as too out there, but it is the triumph of director Jon Favreau (Swingers) that we buy into Buddy's character, that we root for both he and Santa (Ed Asner) to save Christmas, and that we don't question what is going on with Jovie's fascination with Buddy. Farrell sells Buddy to the max, every time we see him, we see a man in yellow tights walking down the streets of New York (or Vancouver, either or), running out into traffic and hugging James Caan. What would Papa Corleone think? Finally, there are the cute little animals that live in the North Pole, Favreau brings us claymation character like the ones we see in 'Rudolph' and countless other Christmas specials, and I'm a sucker for them. Especially walruses. This last touch, seen in the beginning of the film, takes the viewer back to their younger days, where every year we wonder if Santa will be able to leave the North Pole because of the thick fog, and every year, Rudolph comes to the rescue. I think that's where the film's charm comes from. While not a great film, Elf is harmless holiday fun for the entire family, well mostly harmless. Will Ferrell does wear yellow tights...",7,2,4,13 February 2005
Lost in Translation," 'For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.'
","Watching Lost In Translation reminded me of the first week I was in college. The world was foreign and new, and I knew very few people. That first week was difficult, as the only people I really communicated with were those I saw around my dorm. Now change college to job in Tokyo, and change dorm to hotel, and that is the setup for Lost In Translation, the critical favorite of 2003 that won director Sofia Coppola an Academy Award for best original screen play and nominations for best picture, direction and acting for Bill Murray. Murray plays actor Bob Harris who is in Tokyo to shoot commercials for a whiskey. The actual shooting takes very little time, so Harris has to fill the other hours in a place where he knows no one. The most poignant scene for me was when Harris plays golf all by himself at a beautiful golf course in the shadows of Mount Fuji. Golfing by yourself may be the most boring thing anyone could do. Sure, golf is fun and challenging, but the human interaction that occurs while on the course is what makes it what it is. Coppola couples the scene of loneliness with all out beauty, a brilliant green course, the mountain over the fairway, and just one man hitting his golf ball. Harris does find comfort in another lonely American, Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson, who's staying in the same hotel. She's in Japan with her new husband while he works, as a photographer. The two find comfort in each other, not for the cliché sexual reasons most movies these days would go, but rather to stave off boredom and overall loneliness. During the nights they spend together, they run around arcades and various other places in Tokyo that most Americans do not know about, and talk about life. Each is married, each not sure they are happy about it. By the end of the movie, we are expecting for them to fall in love, but they don't, and that's what I like about the movie. The easy way out is never taken, just two souls in a foreign land just trying to fill the hours and trying to figure out what it all means. The vastness of the long shots add a wonderful visual style to the film, adding the feeling small, out of water fish in a huge land that does not take them in. Lost In Translation is a very quiet movie, one that is probably better when watched, not heard.",8,1,2,13 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 'Be mindful of your thoughts...'
","Perhaps even now, nearly 3 years since this movie first appeared on screens, it may be too early to fairly judge the second chapter of the Star Wars saga, The Attack of the Clones. As the pieces of this awkward jig-saw puzzle that is the Star Wars saga come together, it has become more and more difficult to judge the stories of each chapter. How will it set up the next movie? How much of the first and second movies relate to the last 3 movies? Do we need to care about these characters? After the final movie of the the 6 movie series by George Lucas hits the screens in May 2005, the successes and failures of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones will finally be clear. I say all of this because I have always been a fan of the Star Wars movies, and as excited as I was to see new movies about the time long ago in the galaxy far, far away, it has been hard to say that these first two movies have been what was expected. The original Star Wars movies were full of joy and whimsy, going places we have never been before, battling an enemy we have never seen before, but can identify with. Good vs. Evil is easy to see, and perhaps it's that the early episodes in the saga are murky in who's good and who isn't hinders the films. The Attack of the Clones looks great; we know everything is generated by a computer, but still looks right and good enough that we accept it as real. My favorite scene is how the special effects artists zooms from one passing ship to another, making it look like it was shot with a real camera. The acting is wooden, perhaps encouraged by the dry script. The love story we are subjected to is pretty lame, which for 'forbidden' love, that's hard to do. Where is Han Solo and Princess Leia's sassy triste when you really need it? Ewan McGregor is good enough as Obi-Won Kenobi, but the other characters are unmemorable and uninteresting. The story itself, I will say this, it does leave a lot of interesting places for the 3rd film to go, assuming of course Lucas does that. I said the same thing after Phantom Menace but Attack of the Clones didn't really capitalize on the openings that were there. Again, the ultimate judge on this film is how it fits in with the other segments of the Star Wars saga. If this was the build-up to a climatic Revenge of the Sith, then it will be worth your time to check out Episode 2. If the third movie veers off into other plot points, then don't waste your time with Attack of the Clones. Just go out and rent The Empire Strikes Back for a well done middle cog to a 3 movie trilogy.Note: After seeing Revenge of the Sith, this movie is almost rendered pointless. It does set up a few plot points in Revenge of the Sith, but nothing that could not be handled through conversations.",7,6,12,13 February 2005
American Pie," Warm Apple Pie...
","The end of high school is an awkward time. Some people don't know how to handle relationships into college, some people are just trying to get into college, but the most important thing to take care of is to of course have sex before you leave high school. Sooooooo important, well, at least according to American Pie, the surprise hit of 1999 that is funny, even if it's priorities are in the wrong place. I guess we do have to give the movie credit, it does feature high schoolers who are still virgins, something that few movies still acknowledge. Jason Biggs plays Jim, a confused teenager who does not quite play the whole social scene perfectly, but is an overall nice guy. His friends are Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thoman Ian Nicholas), and Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas), with a passing acquaintance with Stifler (Seann William Scott, in the role that made him). Stifler is that jock in high school that it was an honor to have him know your name. As prom day approaches, the stresses of the senior days of high school get to all of the friends and the comedy takes off from there. The movie does have a fresh look at how teens today deal with life, and does have crude comedy that is unthinkable, but you know what, I'm sure somewhere it happened to someone. Eugene Levy plays the father in a perfect role for him, he covers the uncomfortable parts of raising a growing boy well. American Pie is a funny movie about 4 boys trying to have sex, and if that sounds like entertainment to you, go see it already!",7,0,1,13 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'Great! Where are we going?'
","The Lord of the Rings saga ranks up there with the Star Wars trilogy as ground-breaking film experiences. Unlike Star Wars, there was no surprise that the first chapter, The Fellowship of the Ring, would do well at the box office. The strongest of the Lord of the Rings movies, the results of years of work by director Peter Jackson and his team, The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the important characters and introduces the mythology surrounding the hobbits and the elves and the dwarfs and the various other creations of JRR Tolkien's mind when he wrote the series of books. The story can be summed up as the struggle by one hobbit (a shorter, hairier, way too optimistic human), Frodo (Elijah Wood) comes in possession of the mystical ring that contains so much power that is has to be destroyed. The problem is, however, the ring is so powerful, it wants to be found by the evil ones who live in Middle Earth. I liked the mystical plot, the lore that goes along with the ring, I even had interest in the various characters that inhabit Middle Earth. I just wished that the movie was about a half hour shorter. Less with Fellowship, compared to the other movies in the series, there is some fat that could have been cut from all of the Rings movies, 3 hours a movie seems a bit over the top. Fans of the books will eat it up, but the casual viewer has a hard time sitting through it all. The movie looks great, fantastic landscapes (mostly of New Zealand), and special effects that look seamless. Hugo Weaving is the star of the film as far as I'm concerned, he plays the head elf Elrond, you will remember him as Agent Smith from the Matrix films. He delivers his lines the best, easiest for him as he has the most serious lines, the lines that move the plot along and provides back story. Science Fiction and Fantasy movies have always been a thorny issue when it comes to who will accept the film and watch it. Star Wars showed that Sci-Fi could be financially viable, it wasn't just the nerds in the back of the classroom going to the Saturday Matinees. Lord of the Rings has brought the fantasy genre to the same level, and had a good start with Fellowship of the Ring.",8,0,1,13 February 2005
Armageddon," Oil Drillers In Space? WHY?
","File this movie under 'they put the entire budget into the special effects, not the story' category. The special effects looks great. It is easy to mess up asteroids slamming into Earth, but Armegeddon takes care of that side of the equation well. Now, if only they put as much effort into the story, we'd have a good movie. As it is, it's a nice movie to look at, but a terrible movie to have to sit through. Who's bright idea was it to make deep-sea oil drillers the men who will save the world? I like Bruce Willis, but if our lives were in Hudson Hawke's hands, I'd immediately invest some time in parachute-less skydiving, I think I'd have a better shot of seeing the next day. Ben Affleck, I like him in certain roles, but again, I'm not looking to him to be the hero, especially one as emotionally dopey as he is in this film. Now Billy Bob Thornton, if he's running the mission, I'd feel a little better, though it was his idea to send oil drillers who have had no training in working in space on the mission, so maybe his decision making is questionable. I had problems with the movie's logic, which can be covered up with awe-inspiring effects, but the relentlessness of the stupefying plot was difficult to ignore. The ending is cliché in every sense of the word, and maybe one day we'll actually see a movie where the world ends because they sent a team of oil drillers into space! Ugh... what were they thinking? Why not send lawyers into space? At least, that would be a good start.",5,0,1,13 February 2005
The Village," 'Heed the warning bell, for they are coming.'
","M. Night Shyamalan has made some of my favorite movies: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. Now he has written another movie that has what is now known as the 'twist ending,' something he is becoming synonymous with in The Village. I wouldn't dare give away the quick turn to the left the movie takes, but I will say, it disappoints to a degree. It is not a ridiculous ending, but what could have been if Shyamalan had trusted his original premise of a 1890s Pennsylvania countryside village terrorized by creatures who patrol the surrounding woods. We get the usual eerie mood that Shyamalan has given us before. The Village excels in the isolating feeling that we got in Signs. I might be the only person to admit to liking Signs, but I appreciated the humanized battle between one family and invading aliens. Here in The Village, we have one town, cutoff from the rest of society trying to battle a race of creatures who limits their abilities to even treat their sick and injured. The pace of the movie is slow and moody, especially through the orange tint and effective soundtrack. The village is lead by a counsel of elders, including Edward Walker (William Hurt) who is father to two daughters, including the blind Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Ivy has a childhood fling with the local mentally challenged man Noah (Adrian Brody) but ends up falling in love with Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), who is the first to suggest leaving the village to gain medical supplies. After Noah causes harm to Lucius, Ivy decides she's the one to go out into the woods and find medical help. This is where the movie goes from moody mythical theater to that movie with a 'twist' ending. I wanted more, dammit. I don't think I'm the only one. I was intrigued by the creatures, and I didn't like how Shymalan dealt with them. Sure, there is a certain amount of interest and logic to how the movie played out, but it could have been more. I didn't hate this movie, but I kind of hated how it ended. Mr. Shyamalan, for your next movie, perhaps the best 'twist' is no twist at all.",6,1,1,23 July 2005
The Shining," 'Here's Johnny!'
","The Shining is definitely a Steven King story, definitely a Stanley Kubrick movie. Their marks are all over this 1980 thriller about claustrophobia inside a possessed hotel. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, an author who gets the job of winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies where he'd be alone with his family and could write his latest book. The hotel hires caretakers for the winter to avoid ware-and-tear since the mountain blizzards often cuts the hotel off from the rest of civilization. Early in the movie we are told that a previous caretaker had gone insane and killed his family, and ominous sign to be sure. The mood of the film is established even before that scene however, as in true Kubrickian form, the opening of the movie has a certain feel to it that tells the viewer that something will not be right about the coming movie. The strange sound track, the long helicopter shot of a winding Colorado road sets the mood, an uneasy one. As the movie goes along, slow, quiet scenes predominate. Kubrick trusts his story enough to go minutes without any dialog, and the only words spoken have very little to do with the story, much like 2001: A Space Odyssey. Jack's wife, Wendy, is played by Shelly Duvall who has the difficult job of acting surprised when her husband is taken over by the hotel. The more remarkable acting job was turned in by Danny Lloyd who plays Jack's son, Danny. Danny is the distant cousin of Cole in The Sixth Sense as Danny can see into paranormal worlds and has a creepy invisible friend 'Tony.' What make's Lloyd's acting even better is that he didn't know he was in a horror film, perhaps lending a certain understated value to his character. The sprawling hotel becomes a character in the movie, in more ways than one, and we become claustrophobic with the characters as the movie reaches its climax. The final third of the movie is where the action happens, where the thrills reside. Most fans of the King book find the movie slow and plodding as Kubrick builds up to the final parts of the film. From the point where Scatman Crothers returns to the hotel in one of the funniest rescue missions you'll see in films to the end, there are genuine thrills and chills. The film will be remembered most for Nicholson's slide into madness (a role custom made for the actor), but it should be remembered as a well crafted, big buildup/big reward thriller.",8,1,2,10 August 2005
Duck Soup," The Marx Brothers At Their Best
","The Marx Brothers. Four guys, each their own character, lead by the unmistakable Graucho Marx. With the big glasses and the grease mustache, you know him when you see him. And in Duck Soup, the Marx Brothers do what they always do, manic comedy for the entire length of the movie. The movie actually has an interesting plot, involving two neighboring countries, leading up to war over insults thrown about by the character played by Graucho. The other Marx brothers play characters who are not essential to the plot but are always in the scene. There is a big musical number in the middle of the movie about leading up to war, and how the country needs to get excited about it. There is a certain parallel to the world today, as the leaders are the ones excited by war, but never have to fight in it, until it's too late. You may have never seen Duck Soup, but I know of one scene you should all be familiar with: the mirror scene. The famous duet between Graucho and Harpo Marx, imitating each other as if they are reflections in a mirror is the crowning achievement to this very funny movie. It is old, the sound (movies with sound was in it's infancy) and video is not perfect (scratchy black and white), but it is truly a gem, one any comedy fan should see.",9,5,10,13 February 2005
Ocean's Eleven," The Stars Come Out In Vegas
","There is nothing wrong with movies that are as deep as a pile of leaves in June. A fun heist movie does not need an emotional motivations, emotional climaxes, emotion at all. Ocean's 11 is a fun remake of the 1960s rat pack movie of the same title, and essentially the same plot. Las Vegas casinos can never be robbed enough in the world of movies. A fun movie which stars almost anyone and everyone: George Cloony, Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck (Ben's brother), Scott Caan (James' son), Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia, and introducing someone named Julia Roberts. The movie has a simple plot, a crew of ten specialists, headed by Danny Ocean (Cloony) plot to steal over $160 million from 3 Las Vegas casinos owned by Terry Benedict (Garcia). The fun part of Ocean's 11 is that it uses three real Vegas casinos, the Bellagio, the MGM, and the Grande, and uses real boxers in a match-up fans of the sport could only dream about in 2001, Lennox Lewis and Vladimir Klitchko. They may sound like small details, but the success of Steven Soderbergh's movie is in how maybe this heist could actually work in real life. Sure there are a few lapses of logic, just how a team of people could transport duffel bags of hooker brochures into a large vault, I do not know, but the overall style overcomes them. The music, the lighting, the filter used on the cameras all bring about a sense of coolness, high energy that keeps the audience into the plot as much as the thieves. Humor from unexpected sources also helps keep the audience engaged in the movie, and the fun dialog helps as well. Popcorn entertainment? You betcha. Anything to make you think? Nope. Fun and entertaining? Absolutely.",7,0,1,13 February 2005
Resident Evil," 'You are all going to die down here.'
","We've had movies based on books, based on the Bible, based comic books, based on songs, and ever since the mid 1990s, movies based on video games. Resident Evil is based on a video game, but probably could have been based on a night of heavy drinking and watching '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Night of the Living Dead,' one after another. In Resident Evil, an evil bio-research company, called Umbrella Corp, or something silly like that, manufactured a virus that brings the dead back to life and causes them to want to eat other people. The standard horror movie rules apply, if someone is bitten by a zombie, they will become a zombie, zombies can only be killed after certain parameters occur (almost always where something is severed), and the girl with the most revealing dress and the biggest boobs will be the de-facto hero of the film. Milla Jovovich plays Alice who wants to steal the virus to somehow protect the world from it gets caught up in the building where the virus is stored has a security breach, and that causes all heck to break loose. This is where HAL 9000 takes over, errr, rather 'Red Queen' takes over, as the computer has to shut down the building to make sure the virus does not escape, and will do anything to make sure it doesn't happen. Some computer rebooting occurs, yada yada, and by the end of the film, only 1 or 2 of the people who were in the building at the beginning are alive by the end. The movie is directed by Paul Anderson, who also directed 'Alien vs. Predator,' so action scenes are to be expected. Some of the action sequences are so dark, so frantically edited, that while the scenes convey 'chaos,' the message is lost in the inability to figure out what is going on. I would tell you who the men actors were, except they all look alike, so I couldn't tell who was who, they all had the same height, same haircut, one guy wore a blue shirt, but most of the others were even dressed alike. I know there is only one casting list out there anymore, but this is ridiculous. Not the worst film I have ever seen, but after seeing it, I have to wonder why they felt compelled to make a sequel. I for one have not heard about 'Resident Evil Mania' out there.",2,11,21,13 February 2005
Independence Day," Will Smith vs. The Aliens
","The Will Smith reign of terror, errr, i mean reign at the 4th of July Weekend box office began with this modest little movie, Independence Day. One of the most expensive, yet financially successful movies of all time, Independence Day proves that you can remake a movie without anyone knowing it. In case you have not heard of it, the movie War of the Worlds from the 1950s is the inspiration of this aliens-will-take-over-the-world story, whether anyone knew it or not. Will Smith plays a Captain in some branch of the military, I want to say Air Force, but it's not really important, Jeff Goldblum is a cable TV repair man who is the only one in the world to crack the alien code (a fact that is not lost on his father, played by Judd Hersch), Bill Pulman plays the president who was elected president because of his heroism in the Gulf War, and Randy Quaid plays an alcoholic crop duster who claims he as abducted by aliens, possibly to find out what makes the Quaids just so talented. The movie follows a simple formula, aliens invade, great looking special effects show Los Angeles, Washington, and of course New York get blow'd up real good, then humanity comes together to find a way to blow the aliens up real good. The special effects are first rate, the acting is solid, but the ending is really silly and is perhaps the most direct homage or rip-off of The War of the Worlds. The most clever part of the movie is the use of Area 51, which I thought was original and could have been the start to a good sci-fi movie, but instead was just a gimmick to the rest of the formula. This is a solid popcorn movie, people will enjoy it, but let's not start looking for awards for Independence Day.",5,0,1,13 February 2005
Alien vs. Predator," 'You're one ugly mother...' movie.
","Hollywood is not the most loved segment of the American population, and it's formulaic, 'lets make a movie just to make money' movies like Alien vs. Predator that continues the dislike. There was no reason to combine two scientific franchises, independently popular, into this gross monstrosity of a convoluted plot of a money machine. Not since the Flintstones met the Jetsons has there been a weaker crossover than this. I'll give the movie some credit, they came up with the most reasonable reason for the aliens from the 'Alien' movies to meet the aliens from 'Predator' movies. We find that over the millions of years that the two 'civilizations' have existed in this vast universe, the Predators have hunted the Aliens (I know they're all aliens, but I'll refer to them based on which movie that were in for my own benefit) on various planets. To save the planet from the aliens for sure, but mainly, I think the predators hunt the aliens for sport; it's like shooting fish in a barrel. There are loads of actors who I have never heard of before, and based on their performance, will never hear of them again. Paul W. S. Anderson is responsible for this movie, in more ways than he should legally be allowed, he directed it, wrote it, and produced it, as well as probably walked the movie to each multiplexed. At least that's the impression I got from the credits, which Anderson may now hold a record for most times mentioned in a single set of credits. The movie is sloppy, the effects look like computerized effects.... from 1985. And what mother would let their boy or girl go to Antarctica in the middle of winter without their hats and gloves? Come on, really? This wave of smashing popular movie franchises together appears to have no end in sight. With that in mind, here's a brief list of movies coming to a multiplex near you: Darth Vader vs. Hannibal Lecter, Daffy Duck vs. Donald Duck (we saw a preview of that classic duel in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?), Drego (Rocky IV) vs. Mr. T (Rocky III), and the one I can't wait for, Mary Poppins vs. Maria Von Trapp (The Sound of Music), where my money is on Julie Andrews. Hey, at least after Freddie vs. Jason and Alien vs. Predator, these movie match-ups can only be an improvement.",2,1,3,13 February 2005
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," 'Just follow the screams.'
","The Lost World: Jurassic Park, or Jurassic Park II as most people have called it, is one of those sequels that existed primarily because Jurassic Park made lots and lots of money. That's not to say that The Lost World is a terrible movie, but it reeked of 'we only made this to make more money.' Even when i read the Michael Crichton book, I had the same feeling. The book did irk me more than the movie did. In the book, Crichton killed off a character who all of a sudden was magically alive in the sequel. At least in the movie, the people who were dead in Jurassic Park stayed dead in The Lost World. This movie follows Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) who becomes the only member of the party who toured Jurassic Park to go public with his story. Now a scientific outcast, Malcom is offered the chance to check out a second dinosaur island for former owner John Hammond (Richard Attenborough). Malcom goes to the island with a new party of Dr. Harding (Julianne Moore), Nick (Vince Vaughn), and Eddie (Richard Schiff), with a special appearance by Ian's daughter from a previous marriage (Vanessa Lee Chester). Spielberg takes the stories in directions that are not as interesting as Jurassic Park went. The one terrifying scene comes via a cliché moment, with a van's windshield slowly cracking under the weight of one of our heroes. The true story of The Lost World involves another party of explorers, this time funded by Hammond's old company who wants to revive Jurassic Park, this time in San Diego. This subplot ushers in one of the silliest, non-needed series of events to happen in the long career of Steven Spielberg. If you have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.",6,1,2,29 April 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," 'Stupid, fat hobbit.'
","I may be committing cinema heresy here, but I have complaints about the second Lord of the Rings film, The Two Towers. Number One: It is excessively long. I know the books that the movie is based on is really really long, and for a book, that's a good thing. When someone is reading a good book, they never want to put it down, they want to be with Frodo and Sam forever as they dodge ring raiders and enter Mordor, the home of Mt. Doom where the ring must finally end up. However, for a movie, it's tough to sit through a 3 hour plus movie, especially one that consists of nearly one hour of fighting between the good guys and the bad guys. What I personally find fascinating with the Lord of the Rings, the mythology of the ring and how the different characters are allowed to act within the rules of the Middle Earth universe, is there, but is pushed aside in favor of a dark, muddy fight. That leads to Complaint Number Two: There are too many characters for non-die hards to keep track of. Perhaps these two complaints come from the fact that my attention span is not as good as it used to be. Now the good: Gollum makes Jar-Jar Binks looks like a Simpsons' cartoon character. The combination of stop-action and CGI animation, Gollum the whithered hobbit looks totally believable and is the most interesting character in the saga, I think. What happened to him? Will the same thing happen to Frodo? These are questions I had that were spurred on by watching the Two Towers. The walking, talking trees are also a triumph in technology, something like this could not happen just a few years ago. The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the 3 Star Wars films, I think The Two Towers is the weakest of the Lord of the Rings films, so there is no definitive word on whether the middle chapter of trilogy suffers or gains compared to the surrounding chapters. It is not a bad film, again it looks great, has interesting characters, but I just wish some fat was trimmed off the film. I know die-hards would have a fit, but the length does keep some casual movie go-ers away, and there is plenty, especially in the end fight scene, to be taken away. But Peter Jackson has a houseful of Oscars, and I don't, so what do I know?",7,2,3,13 February 2005
The Incredibles," 'You know I'm retired from hero work.'
","Oh how far we've come. Remember back in the 1980s when a computer generated cartoon character of a guy in sunglasses looked so ridiculous that some thought computers had no future. After the success of the Shrek movies and Finding Nemo in the early 2000s, the computer revolution reached a crescendo with Disney/Pixar Studio's movie The Incredibles. The richness and scope of the scenes in The Incredibles is what makes the movie so watchable. The story is pretty good too, a solid superhero story that appeals to both kids and adults, with a sly sense of humor that will entertain. The use of a newsreel montage takes older viewers back to the a day when all of the news came in grainy newsreel stories that had their distinctive narrators. But the punchline comes with the real modern concern presented in the newsreel: citizens suing anyone and everyone. The Incredibles tells the story of Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and how they cope with life after superheroes were 'retired' by the government over growing legal concerns. The couple have three children, two of which have special powers of their own. Mr. Incredible takes on the name Bob Parr, with wife Helen, and kids Dash (Spencer Fox), Violet (Sarah Vowell) and baby Jack Jack, as they live a normal, boring life where they can't exhibit their powers. When Bob is given a chance to return to his suit, he takes it, working for someone named 'Mirage' (Elizabeth Peña) who ends up working for the dastardly Syndrome (Jason Lee), who was once a huge Mr. Incredible fan. Mr. Incredible gets into big time trouble, and it's up to his family to save the day. The family becomes liberated at the notion that they can partake in their magic powers, and the energy of the movie really picks up. This leads to some standard chase scenes, but they look great due to the wonderful computer animation techniques used by the film makers. The richness of the colors and details on the screen pack the punch needed to make the silly movie believable. Samuel L. Jackson also plays a superhero, Frozone, who is mainly a background character. At nearly 2 hours long, The Incredibles is lengthy, though never tedious, and is the longest completely computer generated movie to date.",8,1,2,12 August 2005
Slap Shot," A Good #@%&ing Movie
","Some artists paint in oils. Hockey players paint in curses. There had never really been the ultimate hockey movie before Slap Shot came out in 1977. As a matter of fact, I don't know if there was a hockey movie before 1977. It does not matter, as Slap Shot is the only hockey movie worth discussing. Hockey is a funny sport. It has lots of action, fighting, men who drink buckets of beer. Why has this not become a more popular sport??????? All of the charm of being in the world of hockey is captured in this movie, written by Nancy Dowd (North Dallas Forty, Ordinary People) and directed by George Roy Hill (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting), on ice action is only matched by off ice shenanigans involving a minor league hockey team that will be folding at the end of the season. Paul Newman plays an old, ready-to-retire-4-years-ago player coach who has to motivate a bad team that is about to fold after the local plant shuts down. The lasting image of the movie is of course The Hanson Brother, 3 lugnuts straight out of Canada who only know how to fight. Their fighting leads the team into a 'new attitude' that makes them the most feared team in the entire league. They ride the fighting all the way to the top, at the expense of self pride in some of the players. There is lots of cursing, but it roughly captures the spirit of a hockey game, so don't be put-off by the four letter words. You also do not have to be a hockey fan to get the movie either. There is enough human aspects to the movie to entertain most audiences, and the comedy is brash and hilarious.",8,0,3,13 February 2005
Back to the Future Part III," Go West, Young Man
","Robert Zemeckis shot both this film and Back To The Future II at the same time, so it was released just months after #2 ended it's theater run. With the story fresh in the minds of the movie-goer, the best they came up with was an excuse to visit the Wild West. I suppose of all of the times in American History, the most interesting was the lawless West, where drunks were as common as blacksmiths, I just wished the movie makers would have picked a different, maybe more interesting period of time to end the Back To The Future movies with. But as it is, Back To The Future is a worthy end to the trilogy, wrapping up all of the loose ends (there weren't that many to be tied up, so if you missed the first two movies, you're not too far behind) and with more than a wink to the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns of the 1960s, Back To The Future III is fun and entertaining. It just could have been so much more. With Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) back in 1885 by way of the ending of BTTF 2, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox in his signature role) uses the time machine to rescue him. While there, they meet up with the town's new teacher who was supposed to fall in a glen, but was saved by Brown and McFly, another alteration to the geography of Hill Valley. The teacher, played by Mary Steenbergen, falls for Doc Brown, and this union of science minds sets up the climax for decisions that have to be made. Just like the other BTTF movies, McFly needs an alias, Calvin Klein (named after his underwear) in the first two movies, and Clint Eastwood in this one. Knowing that name allows the viewers to rejoice in an homage to 'A Fistful of Dollars' at the end of the movie. Not as good as the first two movies, it is still a good film that ends the trilogy with fun and a satisfying conclusion.",7,3,4,13 February 2005
Mulholland Drive," What The Heck Did I Just Watch?
","That David Lynch, one has to wonder if he even knows what his films and TV shows are about. The man who brought us Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, and Eraserhead directs Mulholland Drive, a movie that makes no sense what-so-ever, and any attempt to figure out what exactly happens is an exercise in madness. There is no point in me describing the plot, it is too difficult to explain, it just has to be experienced. Naomi Watts plays a peppy twenty-something year old from the Midwest who goes to LA to become an actress. Laura Harring plays some woman who was in an accident while in a limo and loses her memory. She doesn't even know who she is. Beyond that, what is real and what is not is hard to figure out, but Dan Hedaya, Robert Forster, and Ann Miller are featured as background players. There is loads, let me repeat LOADS of symbolism in Mulholland Drive, but what everything means is open to interpretation. I think the last half of the movie is a dream, and if you remember your dreams, sometimes time and space are warped, nothing is linear. That is what makes the most sense to me. Also, I think the first half of the movie is about how Hollywood is a horrible place to make a living, but that could only be one way at looking at it. Mulholland Drive is not a movie in the sense most people think of movies. Instead, Mulholland Drive is a piece of art that has to be looked at critically, interpreted as the meaning that the painter hides deep in the movie is hard to finger. David Lynch has always worked in symbolic, strange, out-there methods, and Mulholland Drive is no different. The lasting part of the movie that stayed with me the longest was the soundtrack. Very little music, instead deep, almost so low you can't hear it noises make up the background, as if the boom mikes were sitting too close to amplifiers or some other interfering device. It is unsettling to have to listen to that for the entire movie, and adds to the uneasiness that is the movie. It is a difficult movie to get through, but by the end of it, perhaps you have learned something about yourself, or you could turn to your friend and ask 'what the heck did I just watch?'",8,0,1,13 February 2005
Caddyshack," A True Cindarella Story
","When one would look for the comedic geniuses of the 1970s and 80s, almost all of them show up in Caddyshack. The combination of SNL players and established comedic stars produces one of the funniest movies of that generation. Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Ted Knight, and Rodney Dangerfield highlight the stars of this film, which also boasts fine performances from the supporting players, notably Michael O'Keefe. A caddy who cannot pay for college himself, O'Keefe, aligns himself with the corrupt judge, Knight, to win the Caddy Scholarship. That's pretty much the plot. In between are wonderful performances by the rest of the cast, each playing an individual character that are annoying on their own, but seem to fit in at Bushwood Country Club. There are classic scenes, especially for anyone who has ever played golf. From a Bishop being struck by lightning while playing his best ever round, to 'Na-na-na-na,' to a misplaced Baby Ruth bar, and of course the gopher that inhabits the course. Bill Murray is the hapless course maintenance man who's job it is to take down the gopher, when he's not winning the Masters, a 'true Cinderalla story.' The sheer talent in this movie is why it is a comedy classic.",8,2,3,13 February 2005
Shrek 2," 'How many cats can wear boots?'
","Mike Myers' most famous role used to be Austin Powers, but with the limited success of the last Powers' outing, Shrek may be Myers' comedic legacy. And we are better off for it. Shrek is a lovable ogre with human emotions, wants, needs, and problems. What guy hasn't had a problem with meeting his girlfriend's/wife's parents? The movie begins with Shrek (Mike Myers) and his new wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) meeting her parents in a Hollywood-esquire kingdom, Far Far Away, lead by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews). Upon their arrival, the parents are less than thrilled to see two ogres greeting them. Much of the humor early in the film comes at the expense of Hollywood, as the same sly humor that entered in the first Shrek movie, making fun of Disney, returns here in the sequel. The basic conflict in the movie is identifiable to almost anyone out there, as Shrek tries to find a way to make himself acceptable to Fiona's parents. He even goes as far as to consult the local Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) for help. Problem for Shrek is that the Fairy Godmother is trying to get Fiona to marry her son, the doofus Prince Charming (Rupert Everett). I liked how the savior of so many fairy tales is finally knocked down a peg or two, with Prince Charming the butt of many jokes here. Puss In Boots, a Zorro-like cat (Antonio Banderas) wedges himself between Shrek and his best pal Donkey (Eddie Murphy), adding some more depth to the characters in this movie. I won't go into more detail about the plot, except to say that the movie goes from gag to gag in a surprisingly human way, while keeping the movie in the world of fairy tales. I liked how they were able to keep Shrek a character with real emotions, keeping the story going. The humor, mostly Hollywood references, keeps the movie light and entertaining. The shameless tie-in with American Idol at the end of the film was a bit on the cutesy side, but they kept it funny enough for it to not be annoying. Good, solid, family entertainment here that will make the kids and adults laugh, and enough story here to engage viewers of all ages.",8,0,0,18 June 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," No plot? No problem!
","If there is a weakness to movies by writer/director Quentin Tarentino, it is that the plots are often thin, at best. The first two of his movies, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, contained very little actual story, but the experience of hearing what the characters had to say more than made up for it. Tarantino's third effort, Jackie Brown, had much more story to it, and was my personal favorite. Now comes Kill Bill, Volume 1, which is the first half of what was to be one long movie. At nearly 2 hours, I'm thankful that the movie was cut in half, as there is so much energy in Volume 1 that it would be difficult to keep it up for an additional 2 hours during 1 sitting. The plot in this movie reverts back to early 90s Tarantino, very thin, but enough of a set up to carry the movie. Uma Thurman plays the Bride who has to exact revenge against her former employers for reasons we're not completely told of. We'll have to wait for Volume 2 for the psychological reasoning behind the Bride's methods. Kill Bill, Volume 1 is a fun movie that knows it's a movie and knows that the viewer knows that it's a movie. There is nothing real about it. Somewhere, you'd think the FBI would be investigating a 6 foot blonde serial killer, but not in this movie, and that's why it's so fun to watch. You know you're watching something that is fake, there for our enjoyment. The cartoonish way 88 foot soldiers are slayed has a visual style of it's own, and the beauty of the final showdown at the end of the movie is amazing. Notice the bright blue of the snow, bright yellow of The Bride's outfit, and the bright red splatter that is the final result of the duel, and it's a truly beautiful scene. The movie also features appropriate and timely music, another Tarantino staple. Some people will be put off by the over-the-top, uber-violence in Kill Bill, Volume 1, but those who remember that it is just a movie, one that has very little in the way of 'real life,' will have a good time. Kill Bill, Volume 1 is the set up for the deeper, slower, yet more interesting second half, Kill Bill, Volume 2.",9,2,5,13 February 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," Two Movies For the Price of One!
","In 'From Dusk Till Dawn', director Robert Rodriguez give us a Hitchcockian twist on the audience. The first hour of the movie is a heist film, as two brothers have robbed a bank and need to reach their contact in Mexico. The movie is suspenseful enough on it's own, as George Cloony and Quentin Tarantino (who also wrote the film) play the bank robbing brothers, Seth and Richard. They take a family hostage, lead by father Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and children Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu), and use them to sneak into Mexico. That's when the movie changes from a heist thriller to a vampire scare-a-thon. The meeting point is a strip club where vampires run the show. You can almost hear Tarantino snicker in the background, wondering how he was able to get two of his favorite movie genres into one film. Tarantino also indulges in a passion, I'm sure, of his, as he licks whiskey off of Selma Hayek's toes (his reputation of having a foot fetish is well documented). I was really enjoying the heist aspect of the movie, but I suppose there wasn't enough there to fill entire movie, so the decision to go another way was a good one. The out of left field aspect of the vampire story is jarring and will surprise audiences who don't know it's coming (I guess that counts you out, as you've read this far). The blood and gore that does come from the vampire story is well done and does harken us back to the 1970s super-gory movies. Even Fred Williamson is in this movie. How much more B-movie can we get? There are lots of little jokes thrown throughout the movie, my favorite being Tom Savini's attempt to hide the fact changes are happening around him. The movie will entertain those who like both movie genres that are featured in From Dusk Till Dawn, but those who are squeamish about cursing, blood, guts, decapitations, vampires, or Cheech Marin, maybe this is not for you.",7,0,1,13 February 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," 'Violet... you're turning Violet!'
","Tim Burton's personal style is all over Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, an updated version of Roald Dahl's book that inspired the 1970s Gene Wilder movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The dark undertones beneath a happy, bubbly exterior, the heart of the movie is about greed while we enjoy the candy. The essence of chocolate is what this movie is about. While we enjoy the junk food, there is nothing good for you in it, and there is something evil about it rots your teeth. Burton's knack for making what was once a light and fluffy piece of work a darker, more foreboding piece of art shapes the effectiveness of this movie. He did it in the Michael Keaton Batman movie, and here, he uses a Johnny Depp that is channeling Michael Jackson to bring a new Willy Wonka to life. The man who lives within his own chocolate factory is eerie enough, but one who reminds us of a once famous pop singer who lives in his own Wonderland takes the movie to another level. Unfortunately, the timing could not be worse for the movie, as the weirdness of Mr. Jackson kind of ruins the effect of Depp's decision to make Wonka a weird-loaner type character. Freddie Highmore plays Charlie who lives with his family in a small house where all of his grandparents live in one bed. His one grandfather used to work for Wonka, and when Charlie finds the last golden ticket and wins a trip to the chocolate factory, he takes Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) with him. It's Charlie and 4 other children, all of which fall to greed and excess. The fate of each child is truly frightening, and parents should be warned that their children could be scared. The factory itself is truly awesome. The set pieces are wonderful, great looking, and allow the Oompa Loompas (all played by Deep Roy, digitally reproduced to give the allusion of an Oompa Loompa army) to stage their productions with ease and glamor. The music used is catchy, not the Oompa Loompa song from Willy Wonka, but instead 5 different styles, from rock to jazz. My only complaint came in the scenes explaining Wonka's motivation. It involves scenes with his father (Christopher Lee, which had to have set a record for most blockbuster films starred in in one decade) and his anti-candy bias. The reason for this provides a momentary chuckle, but I don't think I needed to know what made Wonka tick. Overall, the movie looks great, but the execution of the story is brought down by Depp's decision to make Wonka a modern day Michael Jackson, in an age of Michael Jackson.",7,0,3,6 December 2005
Quiz Show," 'We're in show business.'
","I once had a college professor who spent an entire semester trying to convince us, the naive students, that everything on television was fake. The news, the weather, the traffic, it was all a show, for our entertainment, to make money for the TV stations. Perhaps his cynicism was rooted in the game show scandals of the late 1950s, most notably the ones involving the NBC show '21, Presented by Geritol,' and is the subject of the Robert Redford directed movie, 'Quiz Show.' It's too bad this movie came out in 1994 and not 1999 when TV game shows were hot ('Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' ring a bell?), but still a good movie on its own, well worth a look. It is especially interesting if you have any fancy for the world of television, as the behind the scenes play that occurs is fascinating. John Turturro immerses himself in the role of Herb Stempel, a book-smart Queens native who is first supplied the answers to stay on the show '21,' but is then asked to leave the show by incorrectly answering an easy question. After losing to Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a well-to-do intellectual in a family of intellectuals, Stempel begins to talk to the government about his life on the show, and that peeks the interest of a low level congressional subcommittee investigator, Dick Goodwood, played by Northern Exposure's Rob Morrow with a great Boston accent. The internal strife of a Columbia teacher, first appearing on TV, which is still looked down upon by some smart people, and this was before 'Fear Factor,' then having to face the fact that cheating was involved. This movie looks good, has some great music from the time period, maybe it goes on a little too long in one scene where the Van Dorens are trying to prove how smart they are, and the ending was just there, I'm not really sure if we got anywhere by the end, but I still think it's a worthwhile movie, and you can see how decisions are made in show business, both in TV and the movies, and how we, the public, do not really know what is real, and what isn't. The reality TV explosion of the past few years comes under greater focus after watching Quiz Show. Are we still being duped? And what did Geritol really do?",8,1,1,13 February 2005
Major League," The Slap Shot of Baseball
","Sure it's a cliché. Sure, there are no real surprises. But it's fun. Seeing the hapless Cleveland Indians, brought together as a team for the sole purpose of losing so many games the Indians can move to Florida, find a way to win with a manager who was selling tires before the season (James Gammon) with a catcher who's knees are shot (Tom Berenger) and a pitcher who was pitching in the California Penial League the year before. How did he get there? 'I stole a car,' Wild Thing Ricky Vaughn (Charlie Sheen) responds. That is the makeup of an 'every-team' that is the Indians, and is enough to carry the movie from start to finish. Corbin Bernsin plays a cocky (what are the odds?) third baseman, Wesley Snipes is a speedy centerfielder, Dennis Haysbert is a Voodoo loving rightfielder, and Rene Russo makes her movie debut as the love interest of one of the ball players. The man who steals the movie, however, is Bob Uecker as the bumbling Indian's announcer, who is famous for the phrase 'Juuuuuuuuuuuust a bit outside' for a pitch 4 feet off the plate. A true comedic role that narrates the movie and gives us a sense of following a team through it's season. A fun baseball movie, while not the best ever, still good fun.",7,0,1,13 February 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Slow, Cosmic Ballet
","There is no question what Stanley Kubrick is looking for in 2001: man is insignificant. Space is vast, space is monotonous, and humans are insignificant because we cannot comprehend the vastness that is space. This space movie begins on Earth, before man had inherited it, when mankind was still toiling in the form of hapless primates, barely surviving and not at the top of the food chain. Then it happened. What exactly? We don't know, but something from above, in the form of a black monolith, helps the primates become man. Zip ahead a couple of thousand of years (literally, cut from prehistoric Earth to the space age is unofficially the biggest jump in time in movie history) and we find man living in space. One of the most famous, and beautiful scenes, of the movie is the ballet between a space ship and the spinning Hilton Hotel orbiting the Earth to the classical song 'On Blue Danube.' The music suggests grace and elegance in space travel, but the action and dialog suggest slow, tedious, boring work. This might as well be a silent movie, the most interesting dialog comes from a taped BBC interview that appears halfway through the movie. The character with the most speaking may be the computer that runs a ship that is headed towards Jupiter, on a mission to investigate another monolith. The infamous HAL 9000, voted as one of movies best villains, is not really a villain, just a confused cyborg. The computer is in charge of two living, breathing scientist and 3 who are hibernating. There is action, but not in the usual sense of science fiction action. There are no lasers, nothing blows up, just slow, problem solving. What happens at the end of the movie is open to interpretation, and that's the fun of the movie. What one of the astronauts goes through when he finds another monolith orbiting Jupiter is up to the viewer. Whatever you think happens, it is important to remember that we as humans look for answers, but in this universe, maybe we aren't supposed to have all of them. This is not a movie to be taken literally, everything is symbolic. There are no wasted shots, no teases, nothing extraneous. It's up to the audience to figure out, to answer one famous question, 'what the hell just happened.'",10,2,4,13 February 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," 'By morning, you'll be gone...'
","Charlie Kaufman has done two movies now that take personality bending to a new level. In Adaptation, he wrote himself and his imaginary twin brother into a story about white orchids, and here in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kaufman plays 'what if' with two people who are really in love but only remember the bad times and decide to have each other erased from their memories. This is a movie the viewer needs to see more than once, probably more than twice, to comfortably experience the film. Kaufman and director Michel Gondry plays with the time line of the film, and on first viewing, it's sometimes difficult to separate what is happening now and what has already happened. Seeing the film a second time will help the viewer understand the story, but the emotional feelings remain the same. The great revelation of film is that two people have a relationship for a reason, and unfortunately, we only remember the bad times, and forget the good times. For the characters in Eternal Sunshine, this revelation comes way too late for them, and there is a sense of desperation as they try to hang on to the memories they have. Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish who is a quiet, laid back guy who meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), a wild child who's spontaneity scares, yet intrigues, Joel. Carrey once again shows that he's not just a comedic actor, but rather a serious all-around actor. He immerses himself into the character Joel, making us forget this is the same guy who was the Cable Guy. Winslet received an Oscar nomination for her job as Clematine, and it's deserved. She relays Joel's desperation in the last third of the movie, heightening the emotional roller coaster this movie takes us on. After one fight too many, each seeks out Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) who is able to remove the memories of anyone from a person's brain. Joel's procedure is lead by Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood), but turns out to be difficult case. This leads to a subplot involving Dr. Howard and his secretary Mary (Kirsten Dunst) that ultimately leads to a crushing final act to the film. It's a powerful and appropriate finale, where the characters understand where they stand, and their decision makes total sense. Kaufman and Gondry won an Oscar for this original screenplay, featuring a story that is science fiction, and like most great works of science fiction, is not really about the science, but rather the results of technology. Eternal Sunshine is a movie where there is much more than what appears on the screen; each viewer can put themselves into the film, identify with the situations they recall, and perhaps leading the viewer to remember those good times that we each take for granted.",9,2,5,1 July 2005
This Is Spinal Tap," 'But These Go To 11...'
","I know it is boring to give all of the aspects of the movie 'A's,' but I liked this movie so much, I had no other choice. During the height of heavy metal hair bands in the mid-1980s, the American public was ready for a documentary detailing the lives of 'Britain's loudest band,' Spinal Tap. What one has to realize, of course, is that Spinal Tap is made up of 3 comedic actors who have spent time on Saturday Night Live, Laverne and Shirly, and The Simpsons, some of them all 3. Michael McKean, Lenny on L&S, plays lead singer David St. Hubbins, Christopher Guest, later a director of Best In Show and A Mighty Wind, plays lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel, and Harry Shearer, portrayer of many characters on the Simpsons (Monty Burns, Principal Skinner, etc.) is bass player Derek Smalls. The focus of the movie is how a band of rockers who were at the top of the world deal with sagging popularity and lagging record sales. The movie, directed by Rob Reiner, is entirely improve and features cameos of stars before they were stars: Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, Fran Dreisher, Fred Willard, and Letterman band leader Paul Schaffer. Most of the memorable scenes are based on setup. The band appears to be clueless on simple things in life at the start of the movie, but confirmation comes in the middle of the movie when the stage is hard to find at one of Tap's gigs. Another involves the band wanting to spice up their shows with a huge replica of Stonehenge, but the results are pure comedy. As silly as the movie is, the audience really roots for these hapless music makers. The end of the movie is uplifting, well as uplifting as a movie about heavy metal can be, and there is a sense as even when Spinal Tap is down, they still love what they are doing.",9,0,4,13 February 2005
Groundhog Day," 'Have you ever had déjà-vu?'
","What if you had to live the same day over and over and over again? Would you pick the day you were in Punxsatawney, Pa. to watch a furry animal pop out of a hole to see if winter comes in 6 weeks, or in less time? I've been to Punxsatawney, and I wouldn't want to relive that day over and over again either. Unfortunately for Bill Murray's TV weatherman character Phil Conners, that's exactly what happens in this odd little comedy directed by Harold Ramis. What begins as a comedy about 'big time' TV people from Pittsburgh covering the February 2nd rite of passage in Western Pennsylvania. The story ultimately revolves around how Conners is an unhappy man and somehow, he's stuck in a time warp that he can't get out of. He tries being nice, he tries be a bastard, he tries driving out of town, he tries stealing the groundhog, he even tries dying. Nothing gets him out of February 2 in Punxsatawney. Among the many groundhog days, he discovers the world, the people around him. He's saddened by the death of a man he passed every morning. He meets a person he knew in high school, and his attitude towards him changes over time, and he realizes the happiness he needs to fulfill his life is right there in front of him. Sure it's cheesy, sure it's predictable, but there's enough Bill Murray humor early in the film and Bill Murray charm in the end of the movie to hold it together. There are some cute scenes where 'one day' he asks a random woman in a coffee shop what her favorite something is, and the 'next day' uses that information to score a date. There are little scenes like that through the film that rely on Murray, and the audience, buying into the premise of the film. Andie MacDowell plays Conners' TV producer and Chris Elliott plays his camera man, each has the thankless job of playing characters who have no idea that Conners is reliving each day over and over again. One thing that bothered me was the movie was not shot in Punxsatawney, rather some town in Illinois, and that bothered me a bit, but most people wouldn't know unless they were told. Oh well, at least it wasn't Toronto.",8,0,1,13 February 2005
National Treasure," 'You're treasure hunters, aren't you?'
","I have often said there are some movies where you turn the brain off and just sit back and enjoy the movie. And by the slimmest of margins, National Treasure fits into this category. It was close, but National Treasure is full of enough entertainment value to recommend seeing it. Nicholas Cage is Benjamin Franklin Gates, one in a long line of family members who believe that the founding members of the United States, with help from the masons, hid a vast treasure somewhere, and left just enough clues for someone, someday, to find it. The clues take a lot of interpretation (this is where you turn your brain 'off') and neatly take our heroes to the next clue, and so on and so on. Gates is helped by his trusty sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha), who's job is to assist Gates in formulating the interpretation of the clues and to supply the needed joke at the perfect time. He does his job well. Gates also get the reluctant help from Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) who works at the National Archives and knows everything there we need to know to keep the plot moving forward. There is competition from a rival group of explorers looking for the treasure, led by Ian Howe (Sean Bean) who keeps the energy of the moving going. The one person who actually keeps his feet on the ground throughout the movie is Gates' father, played by Jon Voight, who is the one person in the Gates family who does not think the treasure exists. For Voight, this is a rare character who is not a nut-job, and he plays it very well. National Treasure is entertaining, there are some good chase sequences and the movie looks good too. And for once, not a single scene was filmed in Vancouver or Toronto. When we see Philadelphia, we see Philadelphia. Likewise with Washington and New York. If for nothing else, you will learn one or two things about American History (NOT about the pyramid on the back of the one dollar bill however, that was made up) and you will be entertained, and there is nothing in this movie any family to object to. The PG rating is more than earned with National Treasure. This movie is clean, mindless entertainment that will keep people interested in what comes next.",6,0,1,8 May 2005
Reservoir Dogs," Interesting Premise, Solid Outing
","We should have known there was something about this guy from Tennesse named Quentin Tarantino when we saw his first solo effort, Reservoir Dogs. While not as total an effort as his later movies, Reservoir Dogs does have some revolutionary value to it. Written mostly by Taratino, Reservoir Dogs is a crime movie where the crime failed. A group of 6 anonymous men, each with a different code name, come together under crime boss Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) to steal a diamond shipment from a Los Angeles diamond store. The first scene gives us a sense of who these men are and what makes them tick as they are finishing up their breakfast before the heist. The next thing we see is afterward, 2 of the men are dead and the other 4 are trying to figure out what happened. There is the usual Tarantino dialog, featuring lots of cursing, lots of pop-culture, but also unexpected humor, and also boasts Tarantino musical selections that fit the scenes well, most people think of Reservoir Dogs now when hearing the song 'Stuck In the Middle With You.' The film overall is good, Tarantion takes the crime caper movie and spins it around, what would it be like if a movie heist actually failed, but that is about as far as it goes. There is a lot of talking, I had wished a little more actually happened, and the ending is just that, an ending, nothing more. There's lots of blood and people shooting at each other, and is interesting. Tarantino would prove later that he is capable of completing what he started, just not quite with Reservoir Dogs.",7,2,4,13 February 2005
Rocky," Not Every Loser Is A Loser
","There is just something American about a bum rising up and making something about himself. Rocky Balboa has become synonymous with being a nothing, and proving that you can become something, and the 1976 film Rocky is where we find him. He's too small, too much of a nobody to do anything in his amateur boxing career, but when he gets his shot at the champion, Apollo Creed (played with all of the flair of an Ali-like boxer by Carl Weathers), he proves to himself that he can do something with his life. In true typical Philadelphia fashion, he is worshiped, not as a champion but as a guy with a lot of heart who didn't quite make it to the top. We Philadelphians have to take solace in getting close but we never get to the top. Sylvester Stallone wrote and starred in this Oscar winner for best motion picture of 1976, and portrays a down and out bum who had one shot and took it. In the end, he may not have won the fight, but he's happy with the girl, Adrian (Talia Shire), knows that he gave it his all, and came this close to be a world champion. The later Rocky movies were not quite as inspiring, because Rocky wins (in most of them), and where is the fun in that? Losing is still losing, but sometimes in losing, you find out something about yourself which is more important.",9,0,0,13 February 2005
Pulp Fiction," 'Oh, I'm sorry. Did I break your concentration?'
","There's just something about Pulp Fiction that makes it great. It took me a while to figure it out, but I think I found it. This may sound weird, but I think that it's the upbeat message found deep within the movie. What is so upbeat about a story involving 2 hit men (Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta) who kill at 4 people during the course of the movie, a crooked boxer who promises to take a dive (Bruce Willis), and a drug pusher (Writer/Director/Average-at-best Actor Quentin Tarantino)? It's not what they do, but how they come to their decisions, the major decisions that they make during the movie that a hopeful vibe comes about. Take the characters Vincent (Travolta, in an Oscar nominated role) and Jules (Jackson) as two under-armed hit men. After the two whack 3 rookie drug dealers, then accidentally shoot their inside man, each goes off their own way and 'save' someone, both metaphorically and physically, and in doing so, are saved themselves, again both in the physical and metaphoric sense of being saved. The aspect of Pulp Fiction most remember is the script. Things are said by Tarantino's characters that had not been said in movies in years. What would normally be cut out by antsy editors are left in here to give the characters depth, add humor to the movie, and gives the audience something to remember. Who forgets the first scene of the movie after the opening credits, where Vincent and Jules discuss hamburgers in Europe. Or the Bible verse sermonized by Jules before he goes through with business. And of course, the music selections made by Tarantino are almost as important as the script or the actors. It is said that Quentin will pick the music for his movies before he writes the script, it is that important to him, and he uses this extra 'character' in the movie pitch-perfect. The opening credits employ the use of 'Miserlou,' which has become synonymous with Tarantino and features songs from the 60s and 70s to add more depth to each character. We know the Jules is a funk fan, as he chooses to play 'Jungle Boogie' in his car, and that Mia (Uma Thurman) is adding an undertone of sexuality by playing 'Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon' while entertaining Vincent. This scene comes after 'Son of a Preacher Man' welcomes Vincent into her home before the big date at the 60s restaurant where we get to see Mr. Saturday Night Fever dance again. The lure to Pulp Fiction comes from the sum of the parts. The acting is great, humor comes from unexpected places, notably in the final act with Harvey Keitel's man who cleans up problems, and the music all add up to a good movie. The underlying sense of hope is what gives Pulp Fiction it's stature as one of the great movies of the 1990s.",10,2,5,13 February 2005
Mystic River," 'I think all three of us got in that car...'
","Mystic River is not the movie you want to be watching just to kill a few hours. Clint Eastwood's 2003 film is a somber, heartbreaking look at the lives of three men who couldn't escape their childhood. Jimmy (Sean Penn, in an Oscar award winning role for best actor), Sean (Kevin Bacon), and David (Tim Robbins in his Oscar award winning role for best supporting actor) grew up in the same working class neighborhood, living the normal lives of kids playing in the street, until one day when David is taken away by a man who says he's a cop. From then on, all three boys, and later all three men are different, they can never escape their childhood. David was sexually abused by the man who took him away, and the older version of David is a social outcast, Tim Robbins does a remarkable job of showing people there is something wrong with him. Eastwood could have eliminated the first 10 minutes of the movie where the back story is told and audiences would have no problem figuring out that David had something done to him. Jimmy (Penn) has grown up in the same neighborhood to become owner of a corner store with 3 children to his late wife. Remarried, the movie shows Jimmy readying for his youngest daughter's first communion when we find out his daughter was murdered. One of the police detectives on the case is Sean (Bacon) who vows to find the killer of his childhood friend's daughter. Sean and his partner, played by Lawrence Fishburn, begins to investigate whether David was somehow involved. The rest of the movie plays as a who-dunnit with heavy doses of heartbreaking characters. All of the characters are flawed, no one is ever innocent in Mystic River. The conclusion is tough, by the end, there is no one to really root for. David comes across as pathetic, but sympathetically so. Jimmy is a caring father who wants justice, but his own past may catch up with him. And Sean? He's just trying to solve a mystery while trying to forget his past. Eastwood takes his time, setting up various characters and their characteristics. One of the underlying symbols to Mystic River is that anytime someone gets into a car, something bad happens. It happens throughout most of the movie. Mystic River reminds the viewer that every time they get into a car, the odds of dying are higher than when on an airplane. The dark, moody look to Mystic River, shot entirely in Boston (not Vancouver, horray!) is uneasy and furthers the despair we see in the characters. So many flawed characters, such a heartbreaking story.",9,2,4,13 February 2005
The Departed," 'I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.'
","The first lines of this movie are said in a monologue by Jack Nicholson's mob-boss character Frank Costello. He starts with, 'I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.' This line essentially sums up the movie even before it begins. The Departed is an Americanized version of a Hong Kong filmed called Infernal Affairs, and tells the story of two Boston state troopers--one goes undercover and works against the Costello gang from within (Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan) and one works for the Special Investigation Unit while still on Costello's payroll (Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan). Each one lives in a world of deception, each trying to keep their real motives a secret from their adoptive bosses, each trying to out maneuver the other. The Departed ends up being a 150 minute long cat and mouse game between two guys who are referred to as rats in the entire movie. At first, each takes to their responsibilities with vigor and enthusiasm, with Costigan having the more difficult assignment, trying to infiltrate a gang who all knew he was once a cop. As the movie goes a long, we feel the noose tightening around each, as both characters go through moments of dread and loss, until the bloody ending where all of the characters who deceived and schemed ended up getting a suitable punishment. Each character in the movie imposes their outlook on the world on their situations, as each one makes their own luck, so to say, as the first line uttered by Nicholson alluded to. None of the characters are the result of a predetermined destiny, as everyone made decisions on their own and had to live with their results. As Costello said, their environments were all products of their own actions. As far as Scorsese's direction goes, it is as usual top-notch, with quick cuts when quick cuts are needed, a neat opening that gives about as much background information as we viewers could possibly need in a fast-paced 15 minutes before the opening credits even finish, a fine selection of music (almost Tarantino -like in how the music matched each scene), and as much violence and obscenities as you could possibly get in two and a half hours. Boston makes for a fascinating location for a movie such as this--a rich subtext to each character, the possibility for interesting supporting players, and a gritty street life that makes it a poor man's version of New York City, without having thousands of movies made about it already. The one problem with the Boston setting is the accent thing--some of the characters lose the accent then it magically comes back. This is always a concern when it comes to Boston movies. Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are terrific as high-level police officers, and Mark Wahlberg goes all in with his portrayal of the salty Sergent Dignam. But the real stars are DiCaprio and Damon, each young actors who have really developed into well-rounded portrayers of emotion and gravitas. Yes, DiCaprio may never really leave the Titanic, but here he shows he can act in a subtle, yet strong roll in a Scorsese movie that is almost as good as Goodfellas.",8,2,4,18 February 2007
Psycho," 'A Boy's Best Friend Is His Mother...'
","Psycho is an exercise in bait-and-switch by the maestro of playing an audience, director Alfred Hitchcock. What begins as a story about someone stealing money becomes one about murder in a seedy motel shower. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary who is supposed to deposit a huge sum of money, but instead takes it and leaves Phoenix, Arizona, headed towards California. Along the way, she is shadowed by a cop (the classic Hitchcockian theme of distrust towards police) and finds her way to a rundown motel off the old highway, The Bates Motel. Running the once popular, now with '12 cabins, 12 vacancies' motel is Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins in wonderful manic weirdness. You know something is askew with young Norman in the very first scenes we see him, but we can't quite put our finger on it. Is it his stuffed bird collection? Is it how he talks about his mother? Is it the way he communicates to Marion Crane in their uncomfortable conversations they have? It's probably the combination of all of the above, but whatever it is, Perkins portrays Bates in such a manner that we know something is wrong with him. In perhaps the most famous scene in movie history, the switch to the money is made. The star of the film, the Marion Crane character is killed off while taking a shower by Norman Bates' mother in brutal fashion. We the audience think we see a lot more than we actually do, if you look at the scene carefully. The scene is 45 seconds long, but features over 90 individual cuts and camera angles, leading to a manic and desperate moment in the movie. The music during the scene, almost as famous as the scene itself, is cutting with the violins, replicating the action in the scene itself. The shower scene in Psycho is pure movie making, showing the audience what the director wants them to see, and in what he hides leaves the viewer to imagine, and sometimes think they saw what they think they saw. The rest of the film plays as an investigative film, as Marion's loved ones try to piece together what happened after she ran off with the money. The star of the second half of the film is Norman Bates as he tries to cover up the murder by his mother, and his paranoid ways really show up during this period. The film benefits from being shot in black and white and the violin-only musical score adds much more depth to the mood of the film. Made for less than a million dollars, Psycho is also an example of what a director can do for cheap. This movie touched a nerve with the movie-going public, as many people feared taking showers for months after seeing Psycho. It has been said that star Janet Leigh still, to this day, has never taken a shower since filming Psycho.",9,4,7,13 February 2005
Ice Age," 'For a second there, I actually thought you were gonna eat me.'
","The computer animation revolution took off after Shrek broke box office records in 2001, prompting all studios to produce their own pop culture rich computer animated features of their own. The first Fox Studios entry was this one, Ice Age, a funny movie following Manfred the Mammouth (Ray Romano) and Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) as they go the wrong way during the seasonal migration. Manfred has always been an outcast in this chilly society, and Sid just annoys everyone to the point that he's out there by himself as well. The plot takes off when Manfred and Sid find a baby human after saber-tooth tigers attack an early man settlement. Manfred and Sid decide to take the baby back to the humans. One problem is that one of the attacking saber-tooths, Diego (Denis Leary), travels with them, his motivations unclear. The movie follows the traveling party in mainly good cheer and with outstanding animation. The scene where the party slides through an ice shield is especially effective. Ice Age is a good movie that has funny moments, lead mostly through the comedic chemistry that exists between Romana, Leguizamo, and Leary. However, when compared to the Shrek movies, the overall laugh-out-loud humor just does not measure up. However, that is not to say Ice Age is a bad movie, it's just not as good as the contemporary gold standards. The animation, however, is top notch, even the humans, though have their own style, look good enough to do well. Ice Age is quality entertainment, just not to the level of Shrek.",7,0,0,1 May 2005
Kingpin," The Amish and Bowling. Brilliant!
","Only the Farrelly brothers could envision a story featuring a down-and-out has been bowler, played to perfection by Woody Harrelson, and the Amish, specifically the naive bowling prodigy played by Randy Quaid. I'm not really sure what brought these two world together in the Farrelly's mind, but whatever it was, I'm glad they thought of it. A very funny movie exploring what people will do when they have nothing to lose, not even their shame. Harrelson plays the once famous bowler Roy Munson who fell off the map in the 70s when his bowling had was removed from his body, coining the phrase 'Munson-ed,' meaning to be at the top and throw it all away. To help pay the bills, he meets Isheael (Quaid) who has great natural talent at bowling and is convinced by Munson to go to Reno to play in the national championship. Between the Amish settlement and Reno, the two go through various adventures that often pay tribute to Ishmael's Amish naiveté, such as the confusion over who actually has to pay for a lap-dance, and famous scenes from other movies, most notably ones from The Hustler. Kingpin also features Bill Murray in one of his fantastic roles, this time as the swarmmy bowling champion Ernie McCracken. We get the sense that all of the characters in the movie are desperate, either for money for his people, Ishmael goes along on the trip to win money for his Amish settlement, or to reclaim fame and fortune, Munson, or to just be known as the best, McCracken, and it's the desperation that leads to the comedy and the human touch. The film also features Vanessa Angel as a bimbo who helps Munson and Ishmael out of tough spot, and 'Jefferson's on Ice!' perhaps one of the funniest TV parodies in a movie. Just look at Weezie go!",7,1,2,13 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 'Join me, Padmé and together we can rule this galaxy.'
","Yes, we are supposed to look at the movie we've just seen and decide whether the casual movie goer will enjoy it or not. But in this case, I'm going to go with a big 'who cares' to that idea. This is the film made for those who have interest in the Star Wars story. This is the film that people who have even a passing interest in the characters we first met 28 years ago will want to see. A person plucked off the street, never seeing any of the first 3 movies, may not get Revenge of the Sith, but those who have invested any time into any of the Star Wars movies will need to see this film. The two hours fly by, leaving me wanting even more, possibly because there a few more scenes I would have loved to see, but mainly because I was so immersed into the story that I just wanted the movie to keep going. Who cares about the love story dialog (yes, some of the lower moments of Attack of the Clones come back in cringe-inducing scenes), the action and storytelling scenes more than make up for it. Unlike the previous Star Wars films which open on scenes of a single ship flying through space, Revenge of the Sith opens in mid battle, as Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen) are chasing down the dastardly General Grievous (the wheezing voice of Matthew Wood) who has kidnapped the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Senate, Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). A great looking action sequence to the film gets us right into the action, and Star Wars fans will immediately recognize prototypes of TIE fighters chasing down prototype X-Wings. R2-D2 plays a familiar and amusing role during the first 20 minutes as the helpful little droid. After the rescue mission, Anakin meets up with his secret wife, Padmé (Natalie Portman) who has big news: she's pregnant. There were gasps in the audience I was in after it was revealed who she was about to bare, but for those who paid attention to Return of the Jedi, there's no surprise at all. The rest of the film plays off the fact that Anakin had dreams of his mother dying just before she did in Attack of the Clones, as he begins to dream of his wife dying. Anakin's quest to save his wife is what sends him down the path to the dark side, ending with him becoming Darth Vader. Back in 1977 when Star Wars (now known as A New Hope) first came out, we thought Darth Vader was just pure evil, but after Revenge of the Sith, there is depth, there is humanity, there is some sympathy in Darth Vader. So much is added to the three movies that come after Revenge of the Sith. Sadly, this will probably be the final Star Wars movie (at least that's what George Lucas says), just when the story becomes the most interesting. There was a lump in my throat watching the final scenes, as Anakin succumbs to the dark side and I realized this was it. Perhaps some of my feelings came from the fact that The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones added so little to the story and Revenge of the Sith was just so good by comparison that so much more could have been done. This movie also gave Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) something to do, and he does it well. We also finally hear from Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) who plays a larger role in the story. The movies emotional pull reaches a peak when Darth Sidious initiates Order 66. Without giving much away, we see the pure evil that exists inside of Darth Vader and the unsuspecting end of several characters from the two previous films. When we see Yoda (Frank Oz) fight the Emporer (Palpatine gave himself that designation) and Obi-Wan fight Anakin, cross cut beautifully by Lucas, the six film saga is complete, everything had lead up to that point. We knew the first time we saw Obi-Wan in A New Hope we knew there was more to his relationship with Darth Vader, and here we see it. George Lucas has completed his story with the strongest chapter since The Empire Strikes Back. So does this mean we never have to watch Attack of the Clones again?",9,2,8,28 May 2005
Back to the Future Part II," To the Future, then Back To 1955.
","Time travel movies are risky, they usually have logic problems that are noticeable. The thing about Back To The Future II is that it takes head-on potential continuity quirks and makes an entire movie about it. Set minutes after the end of Back To The Future, the smash hit of 1985, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) takes Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) 30 years into the future to help their future children out of a potential mess. While in the future, Marty buys a sports almanac to try to make a dollar when returning to 1985. However, the older Biff gets to the sports book first, takes it to 1955 with the time machine, altering the future. Marty and Doc do not know that, however, until a meeting describes what is going on. The suburban Hill Valley turns into a sleazy Las Vegas-type city, run by Biff, turning the sports book into cash to build an empire. Other terrible things happen to the characters we knew from the first movie. The last half of the movie takes place where the first movie ended, at the 'Enchanted Under the Sea' dance, as Marty tries to steal the sports book back from the young Biff. Not as revolutionary as the first movie, this second installment has the most interesting story and the best action sequences as Biff and Marty zig and zag through a conveniently placed tunnel. There is some over-the-top acting, but it's well placed and works well in this fantasy movie. The ending of the movie set's up the third movie as if they were filming them together.... oh, they were. Flimed at the same time as Back To The Future III, it seamlessly flows into the beginning of the final chapter of the Back To the Future trilogy with another fun look at playing with time.",7,0,1,13 February 2005
Shrek," 'Do you know... the muffin man?'
","The Simpsons has been one of my favorite TV shows, and for the same reason that I like the Simpsons is what makes Shrek so good. The Simpsons takes the children-only medium of cartoons and makes an adult show out of it, with jokes in it that only adults will find amusing, some for adult eyes' only. Shrek is animation, a beautiful computer animation that looks realistic and bold, has enough kiddy humor in it to make the kids like it, but has even more jokes that adults will love. It's the cross between childhood innocence and adult knowledge that brings Shrek so many laughs. Mike Myers supplies the voice of Shrek, an ogre who enjoys living by himself in his swamp on the outskirt of Duloc, a near-perfect kingdom ran by the insecure Lord Farquaad, voice with wonderful swarmy-ness by John Lithgow. When Farquaad begins to deposit all of the mythical creatures that populate his kingdom into Shrek's swamp, Shrek demands to see the king, and only the smart-ass Donkey knows the way. Donkey is a sassy talking, well, donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy and is the Lou Costello to Shrek's Bud Abbot--to say Shrek is the straight man in this odd couple is an understatement. After meeting the king, Shrek and Donkey then have a quest of finding Fraquaad Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), an imprisoned lady guarded by a dragon. I personally would have gone with Snow White, but to each their own. What also sets Shrek apart from other animated movies is the music, mostly rock music, mostly from Smashmouth. I do not think a Disney picture would have made the same selections. It gives it a different feel from the usual animated fare, Shrek for sure has it's own identity. Getting back to the animation, the computer generated scenery and characters are great to look at, very lifelike, even the human beings. Pixar, who has made films such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo, has made it clear that human beings are the most difficult objects to animate on computers, but I think DreamWorks got it right in Shrek--there is nothing there that makes me say 'that does not look right.' There are great in-jokes about the world of childhood stories, while sprinkling in some very adult humor. The best sight gags for me revolve around Farquaad interrogating a gingerbread man and threatening a magic mirror. Shrek will entertain and amuse the young and old alike.",8,4,5,13 February 2005
Signs," How Would You Stand Up to Aliens?
","Some movies are seen as one type, when it really is another. Signs is one of them. Most moviegoers thought they were going in to see an alien invasion movie, when in fact Signs is a study of what would one family do if there was a terrible threat from above. The ultimate ending of the planet Earth is not hanging in the balance through the action we see, rather, just the fate of one family. M. Night Shyamalan's third feature film chronicles a rural family living outside of Philadelphia where crop circles begin to appear in the corn fields. The setup is there, and Shyamalan uses the expectation of aliens going 'bump' in the night to play on the audience's fears and create a tense mood of what could be. Mel Gibson plays the father who was once an Episcopilian priest who left the flock after the death of his wife. He lives with his two young children, well acted by Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, and his brother, played by Joaquin Phoenix on a farm in the middle of acres of corn. The focus of the movie is entirely on the family, with the only outside contact coming through their television, as they watch newscaster trying to figure out what is going on in the world. Here, the talking heads on TV are not plot-movers, they are experiencing the same doubt and fear that the families watching at home are going through. My favorite scene in the film is that of when a Brazilian family catch a glimpse of an alien. It has a certain realness to it, as if we were going to catch home video of an alien, it would look just like it does in the movie. The ultimate resolution of the movie has been a source of consternation among moviegoers, if you think really hard about it, on the surface it may not make sense, but you do not know how desperate the invaders are and what kind of risks they will take, even if that means invading a planet that is 80% harmful. The important thing is that it does not matter how it ends, the important part of Signs is how the family deals with the invasion, not how it ends. We can identify with the family, we can put ourselves in their shoes. What would we do? No phasers here, just trying to survive. I appreciated the change, not all alien movies have to end with hi-tech, Buck Rogers weapons.",9,0,2,13 February 2005
The Sixth Sense," 'Do you know why you're afraid when you're alone?'
","We all know the ending by now, so I won't pretend no one knows how it ends. A suspenseful return back into the world of ghost stories carries The Sixth Sense, the first major film success by M. Night Shyamalan. The film revolves around a child, Cole Sear, who is socially awkward mainly because he can see ghosts and struggles with that each day, played by Haley Joel Osment in an Oscar Award nominated role. Bruce Willis plays Malcome Crowe, a child case worker who invests all of his time into Cole. As he investigates what is happening, he finds that he has come across a case similar to Cole's in the past, but is no nearer to figuring out how to help him. The human drama of a case worker trying to figure out what is wrong with his patient keeps the movie going, allowing Shyamalan to drop the clues throughout the movie about the ending. I have to admit I was blown away by the ending, but looking back, I should have known better, and many audiences were able to figure it all out. Some say that if you look at the movie logically, it does not hold water, but that is not the point. The movie is not about logic, but rather the experience as a viewer, watching what the director gives us, as we only see what he wants us to see. The Sixth Sense also boasts a strong soundtrack and looks good, setting a mood that gets the audience in the right frame of mind to be spooked, though it's not a horror movie. Suspenseful, smart, and well directed, The Sixth Sense is an achievement not to be underestimated.",8,4,6,13 February 2005
The Producers," And They Say Hitler Can't Be Funny
","It is often said that the greatest way to get back at someone is to make fun of them in a way that they don't know they are being made fun of. The Producers takes this premise and spits on it. Mel Brooks was a writer for 'Sid Caesar's Show of Shows' and 'Get Smart' before penning his first movie, The Producers. Brooks, who is Jewish (and if you didn't know that, you should have your head examined), used his big chance to get back at the enemy of the Jewish people, Hitler. The Producers unapologetically makes fun of not only Hitler, but how people would react to a Broadway play devoted to the dictator. Not only a smart and funny movie, The Producers features great acting by Zero Mostell as play producer Max Bialystock and Gene Wilder as accountant Leo Bloom who makes the mistake of finding out that a play that flops could make more money than a Broadway hit. This leads to the conning of little old ladies to invest in a play called 'Springtime for Hitler.' The play is directed by the flamboyant and terrible Roger De Bris, played by future Mr. Belvedere Christopher Hewitt, and written by ex-German army officer Franz Liebkind, played by Kenny Mars. The problem? The play actually turns out to be a hit, ruining the plans of Bialystock and Bloom and perhaps saying Hitler can be a commercial success, if in the hands of the right people. Mel Brooks makes fun of Hitler in all of his movies, but makes it a critical plot point in his first movie. Brooks would then go on to write a Broadway musical version of The Producers 30 years after the movie came out and won critical and audience approval. A movie version of the musical is due out in 2005, making it a movie version of a play version of a movie based on a play. Got that?",10,2,5,13 February 2005
Rear Window," Hitchcock, Simple and Sweet
","Alfred Hitchcock finds a way to take a person who is doing the wrong thing and make him a hero, another example of the genius that was the director. Jimmy Stewart plays Jeff Jeffries, a world famous photographer who broke his leg and is wheel-chair bound. In an age before video games, computers, cable TV, for that matter widespread TV viewing, boredom was adverted by leaving the apartment and doing something. Well, Jeffries and his wheel chair couldn't leave the apartment, so he has to fill his hours by eavesdropping on the neighbors across the courtyard from his bedroom. The entire apartment complex may be one of the greatest set designs of all time, an entire building as a set, looking fantastic, like an actual apartment that could be found anywhere, and the source for the success of the film. An unconvincing set, something that looks fake would take away from the real tension that ensues. Jeffries is wrong in watching all of his neighbors going through their lives each night, as we are told by his physical therapist, Stella (Thelma Ritter), tells him at the beginning of the movie. One night, while Jeffries is looking out the window while going in and out of sleep, he thinks he sees a neighbor kill someone (Raymond Burr). Not sure, he discusses it with his girlfriend, the radiant and beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont, and convinces her to go over to the man's apartment to look for clues. That is the setup and Hitchcock pumps up the tension by allowing the audience to see everything the same way Jeffries does, through the rear window of his apartment. There are very few shots that do not originate from somewhere in Jeffries' apartment, a simplistic approach that makes it all seem so real. Hitchcock also fills all of the other apartments with characters that interest Jeffries and ourselves, plus adds a song writer to a studio apartment who supplies the soundtrack to the movie. Every detail shown early in the movie comes into play later in the movie. Hitchcock never cheats, and we are left wondering what will happen next. Rear Window may be the simplest movie ever made, proving you don't have to blow up 700 cars to create a truly tense and spine-tingling movie.",9,3,5,13 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," 'This is no place for a Hobbit.'
","If you were to watch the three Lord of the Rings movies in a row, back-to-back, you would have to be in some pain, not going to the bathroom for nearly 10 hours cannot be good for you. And so it ends in The Return of the King, where we have final fights, final chances of redemption, and final chances for Frodo to either carry out his duty of destroying the ring at Mt. Doom in Mordor or failing and giving into the power of the ring. The film starts by telling the story of how Gollum originally comes in contact with the ring, and we see the evolution of his body as the ring takes over, it is truly disturbing, which is of course the point. Will the same thing take over Frodo? When not watching the efforts of the hobbits Frodo and Sam, we see Aragon, Gandalf, and all the rest of the familiar characters setting up a defense of Gondor at the steps of Mordor (if you followed that sentence, then you are a true fan of the series). And therein lies the problem, but the time we get to the end, only the true fans of the Lord of the Rings films benefit from experiencing this film. No one who had no interest in the first two films would have much interest in The Return of the King. The final struggle between a man and himself is the most interesting part of the movie, again we have a massive battle sequence that goes on and on a bit, but has a few light moments, the battle between elf and dwarf is never done. Then there is the final 20 minutes, or what I like to call 'wrap-up central.' While the three films in the series tells of a few months of action, the final 20 minutes of the movie tells 4 years worth of stories. I kind of wish there was a mystery to what happened next, like in Pulp Fiction, is Jules still walking the Earth. Instead, we see what happens, and I feel cheated. What can I do though? Just accept it and move on, I suppose. Will we ever see such an ambitious series such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy? Probably not in the same fashion, where three films were shot all at once, then released one year apart. But Peter Jackson did pull it off, and now he's got enough Oscars to fill a boat. Good for him! We'll see him next with King Kong in a few years.",8,5,11,13 February 2005
The Matrix," 'You Have To See It For Yourself...'
","A mind blowing movie experience for 2/3 of the film, then it breaks down into a shoot 'em up action film, but by then, The Matrix had already won me over. A different look at reality in the age of computers, the Wachowski brothers bring about a world where no one knows for sure what is real, what is fantasy, and who can be trusted. Sometime in the future, humans made machines to do most of their work, and at some point, the machines took over the world, using humans as power for their work. What kind of work does a machine need to do, I'm not really sure, and something that should have been examined further. To keep humans in the dark, a computer program was produced to keep the human mind thinking they were alive. What is real and what isn't is difficult to define at times in the Matrix and is the source of the most intellectual genius of the movie. The other achievement of the movie is the special effects. Any movie that can make Keanu Reeves look good has to have something special with it. Anyone who has seen any movie since 1999 knows the 360 degree camera pan around an actor, perfected by The Matrix. Reeves plays Neo, a computer programmer at some nameless company who has an underground cult following for his skill. This leads him to Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn), a man looking for prophet, and he thinks he found it in Neo. Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity, a nod in the direction of Christianity, as she is a follower of the prophecy of Neo who happens to do her best work in catwoman-type leather. A refreshing change of pace in the beginning of the movie, as most of the physical challenges involved the martial arts, not running around with things that go 'boom,' but we knew that could not last forever, and the final part of the movie has guns, lots of guns. Hugo Weaving plays the unemotional, almost too perfect 'Agent' who chases Neo down on several occasions during the film, and is the movie's most interesting character. We'll have to wait until the following movies in the Matrix Trilogy to get more in depth when it comes to Agent Smith, and that's too bad. While we are blowing away our minds, I wish The Matrix would have gone all of the way, and make it so we don't trust ANYTHING anymore. Instead, an interesting premise is established, and only most of it is followed through.",8,1,2,13 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Every Saga Has A Beginning, or Middle
","Star Wars was the movie that showed you could use special effects and make it look 'special.' Who is going to forget the end of the movie, with Luke Skywalker shooting through the canyon on the Deathstar, attempting to the be hero. How wonderful did that look the first time you saw it? Nowadays, that is easy for computers to reproduce, but the scale and scope of the effects by George Lucas and his team is what created the sheer awe and joy of Star Wars. The story is not bad either. A classic Western story with clearly defined good and bad guys, with Eastern Mythology thrown in there to add a mystical element, this first movie is actually the forth chapter of what will eventually be 6 (maybe 9?) movies, set the foundation shrewdly of what has become one of the world's most popular science fiction series. The essential characters, some of the back stories, and wonders of the Galaxy far far away are all introduced, and giving the audience a pretty good time while at it. Originally produced as a stand alone movie, the people at Fox Studios had no confidence that Star Wars would succeed so plans for the following sequels were not on the drawing board, Star Wars is entertaining, but do leave us with enough questions about the Force and Darth Vader and the unseen Emperor that when the following movies do come out, the audience was more than ready to embrace them, and make Star Wars the most successful science fiction series ever.",9,1,2,13 February 2005
Apollo 13," We Know the Ending, Yet Suspense Ensues
","Movies based on true stories do have one strike against them, and it's we know how it ends. Apollo 13 overcomes this problem to become a terrific, suspenseful space opera staring American astronauts that we know came back to Earth. But during the most trying times of the aborted 1970 mission to the Moon, the audience is questioning themselves if they really make it or not. The appeal of Apollo 13 also comes from the benefit of actually being shot in zero-gravity conditions. No special effects here, the no gravity you see was the no gravity the actors and the crew experienced, thanks to help from the NASA airplane known as the 'Comet Vomet.' But I believe the real lure of Apollo 13 is how Director Ron Howard made these heroes, these spacemen, real men who had to deal with a real problem. Everyone, from the men just a couple of miles above the lunar surface to the guys who put the carbon monoxide filters together, had to come together to bring home 'NASA's most successful failure.' From the musical score to the claustrophobic feel of the space capsule suggest suspense, and will these men really make it. They do, we know that. But there is always that doubt...",9,1,1,13 February 2005
Fantastic Four," 'What's the worst that could happen?'
","Most Marvel Comics' fans complain that The Incredibles ripped-off The Fantastic Four, and while they are right, when it comes to the movies, The Incredibles was entertaining while Fantastic Four was not. Fantastic Four relies on one-liners and special effects to carry the movie, not trusting the story and bombarding the viewer with quick scenes and supposedly funny lines. Cheap jokes about an invisible girl can only go so far, even for the target audience of pre-pubescent boys. The radiation cloud of doom inflicts unknown damage to five scientists who travel to space in hopes of finding the key to life, rendering each person with radioactive powers. Michael Chiklis, who is usually a good actor, gets very little to do in this movie expect to sulk around and say dumb things like 'It's clobberin' time' or 'Look at me, I'm huge!' as The Thing, and his talents are wasted. Jessica Alba was good as the cute starlet in Sin City, is adequate here as The Invisible woman, while her brother is some guy who catches on fire (Chris Evans) and hates the fact that he cannot use his powers to pick up chicks. He is by far the most annoying character in the movie. The other super hero is Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) who tries to find the cure to the super hero problem while trying to figure out his relationship with the women of his life. The evil doer is again a Darth Vader like manipulator, this time it's Dr. Doom (Nip/Tuck's Julian McMahon), and like most movies, the villain is the most interesting character in the movie. His motivations are clear, and all of his actions relate to his wants as a selfish business mogul. The movie isn't bad, it's just predictable and at times boring. The special effects are solid, though lack any thrills. Perhaps for the inevitable sequel, the movie-makers will give the Fantastic Four more to do than just utter one-liners. If they want to know how it's done, they should go rent The Incredibles.",4,0,2,2 January 2006
Jackie Brown," An Underrated Look At Desperate People
","Quentin Tarantino knows what he likes when making a movie, and what he likes are actors and actresses that once had a career, and then fell off the radar. Jackie Brown stars two actors that fit that mold, Pam Grier, the 70s blaxploitation star, and Robert Forster, who gives an Oscar nominated performance. Grier plays the title character, Jackie Brown, who's an stewardess for the worst airline that connects between her home of Los Angeles and Cabo San Lucas. After her criminal past, she lives on her $16,000 salary, picking up a few dollars by running money from Mexico to her contact in LA, played by the always dependable Samuel L. Jackson. Robert Forster plays a worn down, 50ish year old bail bondsman who meets Jackie while picking her up from jail after she's caught with drugs with the money headed to Jackson's character. While this film boasts the most plot of any of Tarantino's movies, it is still not the most important part of the film. The interaction between two lost souls over the age of 40, and how they try to outsmart their enemies (gun dealers, the feds, the police) is fun to watch. Some complain that at 2 hours 30 minutes it's too long, but I disagree. The length allows the characters to talk to each other, not just about plot points, but to also just talk. The film also features Bridget Fonda as a beach bum, Robert De Niro as a baked ex-con in a truly funny, if not subdued role, and Michael Keaton as an ATF agent who thinks he knows how to handle Jackie Brown. Jackie Brown is on one level about an airline worker smuggling money into the country for her boss, but on a more important level, how desperate and tired people of a certain age will act when the chance is there to make a change in their life.",9,1,3,13 February 2005
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," And Now For Something Completely Different...
","King Arthur never did find that Holy Grail, but from the looks of Monty Python's movie about the search, he did meet a lot of interesting people on his quest. The loony comedy troupe that made the popular BBC television show 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' which featured silly sketches that often didn't end, the famous animation style that looks more like South Park than The Simpsons, and humor that drew as much from 1960s British current events as it did from the Middle Ages. Monty Python was Dennis Miller before Dennis Miller was out of his diapers. All of these influences on their humor come through in their most complete movie, a retelling of the King Arthur legends and lore. And when I say retelling, I mean a series of sketches that have their root in Middle Ages lore and have some affiliation with King Arthur. Methinks the Knights Who Say Ni did not exist in the late 900s. Graham Chapman plays King Arthur, who does not ride a horse, but rather simulates a horse by banging two coconuts together, as he tours the English countryside, trying to find knights for his round table at Camelot. The knights never do make it to Camelot, as Arthur claims 'it is a rather silly place,' instead are met by God and told of their quest. The movie then follows each knight as they meet snooty Frenchmen (notably John Cleese and his flying barnyard animals), the Castle Anthrax and the 18-22 year old women who make scandalous underwear, the three-headed knight, and many other odd creatures. My favorite tale is that of Sir Lancelot (again, Cleese) as he tries to save someone from being forced to be married by their father. After taking out the entire wedding party, Lancelot finds Prince Herbert (Terry Jones) and silliness ensues. In true Monty Python fashion, the last scene of the movie does not really fit in with the rest of the movie, but if you know Python, you know it is the right ending of the movie. Fantastic points about society are sprinkled in throughout the movie, jokes about overacting are accentuated by the phrase 'Get on with it!' as shouted by other characters in the movie, and we even get to learn some Swedish. Directed by Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam, it is a fast paced onslaught of scatological jokes, and shrubbery.",9,0,0,13 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Stop me if you've heard this before--The best of the Star Wars movies
","Generally regarded as the best of the 5 Star Wars movies(so far, the sixth and final one comes out in May 2005), The Empire Strikes Back is everything Star Wars wasn't. Back in 1977, George Lucas brought us the first story from a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, Star Wars (Now known as 'A New Hope'), and it was a bright, cheerful Saturday afternoon serial with some great special effects. Three years later, George Lucas' story about Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo took a decidedly darker tone in The Empire Strikes Back. None of the good guys win in this second chapter of the 3 film saga that makes up the Original Star Wars Trilogy, the film acts as a dark bridge from the light, fun action of A New Hope to the concluding Return of the Jedi. Even the last scene of this film reeks of 'To Be Continued,' without actually saying it. The rebel forces, after blowing up the Death Star, are forced to hide out on a the ice planet Hoth. Darth Vader tracks them down, and our heroes are forced to flee. Han and Leia go one way, Luke has to find the Jedi Master Yoda on his secluded swamp planet (voice of Frank Oz). Yoda may be the most lifelike character in 'Empire,' and that's a pretty good compliment to a Muppet. We see Luke fail to master his Jedi powers, and we see him leave in haste to try to save Han and Leia who walk into a trap while visiting Han's old card playing friend, Lando Carisian (Billy Dee Williams). How Luke tries to save his friends is unimportant, as the single most shocking movie revelation comes during the final duel of the movie between Luke and Darth Vader. Unsuspecting movie goers have been blindsided by this scene for decades now. The tone, set by director Irvin Kershner, is darker and more serious, lends an adult feel to what is basically a kid's movie. The special effects are again top-notch, especially in the beautiful Cloud City and the fantastic looking asteroid field chase. Who knew in 1980 George Lucas had reached the pinnacle of his Star Wars franchise with a movie starring a green little troll voiced by the same guy who voices Miss Piggy?",10,4,7,14 February 2005
Sin City," 'Tell anybody the truth and they're dead!'
","Robert Rodriguez is an ambitious filmmaker. He's done an old west trilogy, he's done 3-D kids movies, but his crowning achievement thus far is Sin City. Not just story wise, but visually and technically, Sin City is a triumph. The glossy, rich look that this movie possesses is something to behold. The use of black and white gives depth to the story and lush look that will not doubt be copied in the future. Most of Sin City was done in front of green screens with the backgrounds added later, much like Sky Captain was, and the transition to finished product is wonderful to see. Based on the graphic novels, as in illustrated comic books but could also apply to the very adult content of the stories, by Frank Miller, Sin City translates three of Miller's stories into the film, held loosely together by a running storyline. The stories pretty much follow a standard formula: an unlikely hero gets in disturbing trouble and they have to fight their way out of it. Greed and power are overlying themes throughout Sin City, often ending with violent results. Bruce Willis plays a detective with a bum ticker, Jessica Alba plays a stripper, Rosario Dawson plays a commando hooker, Brittany Murphy plays a waitress, Mickey Rourke plays an ex-con who is on a mission for survival, Clive Owen and Benecio Del Toro play opposite each other for one storyline, and Elijah Wood plays the most disturbing character in the movie, the mute Kevin. This is only a partial list, it's a fun game to watch Sin City and try to figure out where you've seen each actor on the screen before. Rodriguez shares the directing credits with Frank Miller, as the movie takes it visual style straight from his books, and Quentin Tarantino, who directed one scene. The movie bogs down in it's length, as three of Miller's stories are condensed into this two hour movie. This lead to some confusion on which character was which and why they were doing the things they were doing. The movie would have benefited from disposing of one of the three stories and saving it for the inevitable sequel. The stunning visuals however overcomes any qualms I had with the plot. The violent nature of the movie will detract some viewers, and that's OK. This movie was not made with the casual viewer in mind. Sin City is best viewed when the viewer is prepared for horrifying violence and beautiful black and white photography.",8,0,1,21 August 2005
Gladiator," A Guy's Night Out
","This is the guy's movie. No way around it. There's armies in combat, there's a father and son drama, there's gladiators (no duh, in a movie called Gladiator), there are women in skimpy outfits, and by the end, more violence. Not that any of this is bad. You just need to know what to expect when seeing this 2000 Oscar winner for best picture. Oscar winner Russel Crowe plays Maximus, a general in the Roman army who is next in line to be ruler of Rome, as the rightful Emperor-to-be Commodous (Joaquin Phoenix) is bypassed by Caeser Marcus Arillias (Richard Harris) in his final attempt to bring back to the old republic. After the Caesar's death, Commodous orders the execution of Maximus, which begins the epic portion of Gladiator. By the end of the movie, scores are settled, more battles are won, legacies are sealed, and every man in the audience has seen everything he could have wanted. No romance here, so the ladies will have to rely on seeing Russel Crowe running around without much clothes on. The best performance for my money is by the late Oliver Reed, who died while filming was in progress. Reed plays an emotionally unattached slave trader who trains Gladiators to fight in Rome. The movie looks good, for the most part. The computer generated Rome leaves something to be desired however, as the buildings look metallic and cold and some of the people watching the Gladiators are out of focus and not wearing togas. For shame, no togas!!! It's a great man's movie which have some small faults to it, but still good nonetheless.",7,0,2,13 February 2005
Contact," Billions and Billions of Ideas
","Some people disliked this movie because it's an alien movie without aliens. And that's why I loved it. Based on the book of the same title by noted astronomer Carl Sagan, Contact is the story of how we, humans, will most likely find out that we are not alone. It stars Jodie Foster as a faithless scientist who learns a lot about herself and fellow man when she finds a ratio signal coming from the star Vega. The movie speculates that humans will have to communicate with other life forms via radio waves first, not by getting on the Spaceship Enterprise and zig-zag through the universe or coming across a crashed UFO. It's no surprise that a scientist wrote a story that contains the most likely scenario of first contact, and makes other science fiction movies look like science fantasy. The ending of the movie contains a powerful message of where science and religion can find middle ground, of course after the infamous 'non-alien alien' scenes. I loved that scene. You don't have to have little green men to know that you are seeing something not from this world, but some people felt cheated by this outcome. I didn't. I felt it made the movie stronger, yet another likeliest scenario, not what we hope will happen. Smart movies like Contact do not come along often, and I wish they would.",9,1,3,13 February 2005
Donnie Darko," Questions Aplenty (Based on original release)
","I'm a science fiction kind of guy, so when I heard the good word about the movie Donnie Darko, I was excited. My anticipation was only partially met. Yes, it is a quality science fiction movie, but there could have been a lot more to it, and a little less of an ambiguous ending. I do not mind having unanswered questions at the end of the movie, but I just thought there was too much to this movie that we were expected to know. Regardless, any movie where the world is scheduled to end by a certain date automatically has my attention, I like that kind of thing. The acting, especially Jake Gyllenhaal in the title character, is top notch, and since it takes place in the late 1980s, there is fun nostalgia of the date. The political divide between the older Bush parents and the young Dukakis kids is priceless. The movie revolves around Donnie Darko who has an invisible friend Frank who walk around in Darko's mind in an evil looking bunny rabbit suit. The music sets the tone to the movie perfectly, lots of 80s songs and low, quiet composed music setting the mood of despair and questioning of what's really going on. While a fun movie, the ending left me asking questions about what we saw, and that's good, but I thought there was one question too many. Perhaps the longer director's cut helps wrap up the movie a little better. A mentally challenging movie to be sure and would be perfect if we were presented with all of the facts.",8,0,0,13 February 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 'Germany has declared war on the Jones boys.'
","The third movie in a movie franchise is a difficult one to make. People who enjoyed the first 2 movies have aspects of the films they love and want to see again, but there is a risk of being repetitive. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade does feature elements of the previous movies that fans would enjoy (Nazis, chase sequences, religious relics, snakes) and brand new elements that appeals to everyone. Brand new to the saga in this movie is Sean Connery's role as Indiana's father, Dr. Henry Jones. An aloof father, consumed by finding the Holy Grail, Connery plays the detached father very well, opening up to Indy only after he thinks he's dead; no one is surprised that Indiana was raised by such a role model. The elder Jones has gone missing, leaving the younger in quest to find him. This adventure leads Indiana on the path to find the Holy Grail as well, trying to retrace his father's steps. This first takes Indiana and Denholm Elliot's Dr. Marcus Brody to Venice, where they meet Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody). A trip through the catacombs of a Venice church and a Bonds-esquire boat chase through the city's canals reveals the truth of Dr. Henry Jones' location, setting into motion a trip through Italy, Austria, Germany, and finally finishing somewhere in the Holy Lands. The Nazis are featured again as the villains, with the full power of the Third Reich chasing down the Jones family. Sallah returns, first trying to protect the inept Brody (perfectly set up by an Indiana speech), then as Indiana's traveling companion who likes to collect camels. This is the funniest of the Indiana Jones movies, with several sly, dry moments of wit, most at the expense of poor Dr. Brody. This movie features planes, zeppelins, cars, tanks, motorcycles, boats, and trains, all of which are the backdrop to this adventure film. On equal footing as the original Raider of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a worthy adventure to (momentary at least) finish off the franchise.",9,0,1,2 October 2006
Back to the Future," '1.12 Gigawatts? Great Scott!'
","Time travel movies make people have headaches, so Robert Zemeckis wisely added another layer to his movie, Back To the Future. The central question of Back To the Future is not what would it be like to go back in time, but rather, a bigger question: 'What were my parents like as teenagers?' As teenagers, we always heard our parents give us rules about what we could and could not do, and we never thought maybe our parents were telling us what not to do because they did that stupid stuff themselves, we just assumed they always knew best. But what would it really be like to see what kind of awful things our parents did while young. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), for better or for worse, finds out in Back To the Future. While trying to outrun Libyan terrorists in a modified DeLorian, McFly is transported back to October 27, 1955, 30 years in the past for this 1985 film. Doc Brown (a manic Christopher Lloyd) invents the process to time travel and put it all together in the DeLorian, and is a young scientist when McFly looks him up in 1955. Not believing the story of 'Future Boy,' especially after he says Ronald Reagan was president in 1985, but is eventually convinced and tries to help the young man out. While trying to get back to 1985, McFly accidentally ruins the moment that his father (Crispin Glover) meets his mother (Lea Thompson), possibly ending his own life. Parents don't meet, they don't have babies, and don't have Marty. Worse, Marty's mother starts to fall for him, so he needs to get his father and mother back together. Seeing his parents back in their teenage days is enlightening and will serve as a surprise at the end of the movie. There are several jokes about time and space, how Twin Pines Mall becomes Single Pine Mall is amusing and other changes to the town from the beginning of the movie to the end is interesting. But most of all, what would your parents to be like if you visited them 30 years ago? A great question, though do you really want it answered?",8,1,3,13 February 2005
Goodfellas," 'Am I A Clown, Do I Make You Laugh?'
","There are two halves to this movie. The first half is the opening of the world to Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), the world is his oyster. The second half is the claustrophobic closing in on his world by everyone. It is how director Martin Scorcese is able to get the audience to feel these emotions where the genius of Goodfellas comes from. The visual cues given to the audience further the story along as much as the dialog does. Who's-who of Italian actors all star in this story about the mob in New York before Henry Hill enters the 'Witness Protecion Program.' Based on the book by Hill, it details his entire life, from a young boy wanting to be part of the mob, to his 20s when he's part of the clan, getting into the back doors of his favorite clubs, making money off airline heists. It then shows his downfall, drugs begin to take over his and his wife's life (played by Lorraine Bracco of Dr. Melfi fame), leading up to the defining moment of the movie when the Hills are shadowed as they move about town by an ominous looking helicopter all day. The feeling of the walls closing in is choking as Hill knows it's checkmate and he has to go over to the other side. The movie also stars Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, who like Hill is not Italian so can never become a 'made man' but still runs the mob while most of the higher-ups are in jail, Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for his role, as the hotheaded Tommy DeVito, and various other well known Italian actors. Considered one of the finest movies involving the mob not named The Godfather, Goodfellas shows both how wonderful it can be to be in the mob, but also the costs, the emotional strains on the families, and the ultimate price paid. To this day, Henry Hill is still in 'The Program,' while most of the characters chronicled in the film are either dead or just getting out of jail. A great visual look at both the good and bad of the mob, and all that goes with it.",8,0,2,13 February 2005
Jurassic Park," Real Dinosaurs! Well, As Real As It Gets
","When one looks back at the evolution of movies, Jurassic Park has to be on the list. It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it was THE groundbreaking movie on the 1990s on the special effects front. This was the first mass-marketed, studio produced movie to use computer generated creatures, creatures who were seamlessly inserted into a live action movie. Special effects we take for granted now were pioneered by Steven Spielberg and his crew of special effect artists in Jurassic Park. The movie requires fantastic special effects, the story based on the Michael Crichton book by the same name about genetic engineers bringing dinosaurs back to life 65 million years after they died out. The story is pretty much the standard scary creature movie, as the dinosaurs chase people, eat people, scare people, but is still entertaining through the effort of Spielberg. The tension created through the various scenes in the movie and the real-life quality of the dinosaurs. Herky-jerky, fake dinosaurs would not be real-enough for the audiences, diminishing the tension that is created by dinosaurs chasing the characters in the movie. A fun science fiction story is turned into an almost life-like dinosaur chaser movie because of the revolutionary special effects seen in Jurassic Park.",7,3,6,13 February 2005
All the President's Men," 'It leads everywhere.'
","The downfall of Richard Nixon has always been incredibly interesting, at least to me it has been. What lead to Watergate? Was Nixon so insecure about his own standing in the country that he had to find out what the Democrats were doing? Who knew what, and when did they know it? What were really on those tapes? I could go on, but no movie about the end of the Nixon Presidency answered, and raised more questions, then All The President's Men. Starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, respectively, the two men credited as breaking the Watergate scandal to the masses. What starts as a blurb on the newswire about a break-in at the Democrat's national headquarters in the Washington's Watergate Hotel, the film retells the investigation, based on the book by the same name by Woodward and Bernstein. Jason Robards plays Ben Bradley, editor of the Washington Post who gives direction and discretion to the story that could end a presidency. The magnitude of what the journalists reported comes across, we feel the pressure for them to get it right. If they are wrong, innocent people could lose in the court of public opinion, and their journalistic careers are over. Though told from the point of view of Woodward and Bernstein, the film is fair to all sides, the errors are retold as well as the successes. The film also brings the world the mythical creature known as 'Deep Throat,' an anonymous figure who waits in the dark for the plucky reporters to come and ask him what he knows. To this day, the true identity of the inside man (or woman??) has yet to be revealed. The movie does end on an awkward note however, but perhaps the right note. The film is about the newspaper reporters, and when their job is over, so is the movie. We do not see the Congressional hearings about the White House, we just see a print out of the events that occurred after the movie. It is a bit sudden for some, but since the news investigation is over, Woodward and Bernstein's role in Watergate is over as well. You won't learn much about the personal paranoia that engulfed Nixon, for that, I suggest you check out Oliver Stone's lengthy bio-pic 'Nixon,' but you will learn how the walls closed in on Nixon and his lies, lead by the press, specifically the Washington Post. All the President's Men show how wide in scope the government cover-up was regarding Watergate, and how 2 men asking the right questions, and with a little help from a mysterious man in a dark parking garage, can help set in motion the events to bring down an American President.",8,3,5,13 February 2005
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," 'I wanna go fast!'
","When looking at the merits of a movie and decide whether it is good or not, one must think of the goal of the picture. Is it a serious film, designed to comment on society, or is the movie's job to merely entertain? I think we all know the answer to this one when it comes to Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. This movie's goal is to entertain the audience, make them laugh, make them spend an hour and a half rejoicing in talented comedians doing their job well. And this movie reached its goal. Not only is this movie an above-average sports movie (it even concludes with a big race and a warm and fuzzy winner!), but is also a very funny movie. All I had to do was listen to the reaction of the sold out theater I was in and I knew that most people will find this movie to be very funny. Will Ferrell is Ricky Bobby, a NASCAR driver who makes up one half of 'Shake and Bake,' with John C. Reilly's Cal Naughton, Jr. being the 'Bake' half of the duo. They are childhood friends who have now become teammates on the top NASCAR level, where Cal sets up the play that lets Ricky win almost every race--that is, unless Ricky has already crashed out of it. Talladega Nights follows the same story arc that Days of Thunder did, but is far more entertaining, as Ferrell and Reilly work together to bring humor to all parts of the racer's lives, including a bizarre dinner ritual that includes corporate sponsorship. Sure, the movie slows down for about 20 minutes in the middle to develop plot, but that may have been designed to give us, the audience, a break, allowing us to get ready for the final scenes of the movie. Sacha Baron Cohen (aka Ali G, Borat) plays the French Formula 1 driver who threatens to oust Ricky Bobby as the best driver on the track, perhaps the funniest overall character in the movie. There is not one scene with Cohen in it that isn't funny. After watching this movie, it is clear why Will Ferrell takes his comedies so seriously (watch the extras on the Elf DVD to see Ferrell between scenes, he's not always 'on' playing the clown on set)--he gets the results he's looking for. This movie is laugh-out-loud funny pretty much from start to finish, and seeing Gary Cole return to comedy as Ricky Bobby's father will bring back memories of Office Space for a moment, then this new character will win you over.",7,60,98,4 August 2006
