10 Cloverfield Lane," Excellent movie, but...
","Its the kind of movies that truly adore. Keeps you hanging there! Cast is excellent and the plot is full of mystery and doubts. Plays with your mind in a clever way. At some point you don't know what to believe. And that's a very powerful card for a movie.But.. Yes there is a but. At least for me. Man oh man. You got there a movie with all the above characteristics and you end it up this way? I truly enjoyed every minute of the movie, apart from these last 5-10 minutes? Should have a more down to earth finale. OK the finale of the finale it is good, expected but good because its the 'logical' thing to happen. But the escape-fight... Looked like some kind of Terminator XIV...",8,1,2,17 August 2016
