3:10 to Yuma," A Must See for Western Movie Fans
","I loved everything about this movie. Please don't spoil the plot or anything else for those who want to see it. I knew nothing about it before I went in -- only that it was a western. I have watched western movies my entire life and this one ranks up at the top, along with my favorites Unforgiven, Open Range, because they are more realistic. I like Russell Crowe and he lends enough subtle wit to his character to make him you like him, but he is still no doubt a rotten character. The actor who plays Charlie Prince did a great job at playing a psycho with an unusual loyalty to his boss (Crowe). I didn't even realize that Peter Fonda was the stage-driving, bounty hunter until the credits rolled! The movie didn't leave me stunned or shocked, but rather satisfied that I had just seen a wonderful western and wish they would make more like this!",10,2,6,7 September 2007
