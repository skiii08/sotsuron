Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sucks to the bad press about it, it rules!
","Despite the poor reviews it has received, the film is simply awesome. One may seemed disappointed after seeing it for the first time, but now that I've seen it eight times it has become my favorite movie of all time. Yes, a peculiar phenomenon, being disappointed after the first time but loving it now, but a phenomenon that is defeated by repeated (and quite enjoyable) viewing.",10,0,0,24 July 1999
