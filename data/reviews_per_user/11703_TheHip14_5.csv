Requiem for a Dream," What a movie!!!!!!!
","Based on the book by Hubert Selby Jr, Requiem for a Dream, revolves around four people. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his mother Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Harry and Tyrone start as drug users yet as the movie progresses they become frequent dealers. Harry's girlfriend Marion is also a drug addict who dreams of one day opening a cloth store and designing her own clothes. Harry's mother, Sara Goldfarb lives alone. Her husband died and her son Harry only visits her when he needs to sell the T.V. to the pawn shop to get money for a fix. Then Sara will go buy the T.V. back. This process has been going on for a while. Sara has no real friends and feels she is a no body. Sara also has an obsession. She is obsessed with T.V. That is why she is thrilled to get a phone call saying that she is going to appear on T.V. She wants to wear her red dress that she wore to Harry's graduation. One problem, it doesn't fit, she has put on weight. One of her friends recommends going to see a doctor. The doctor gives her weight loss pills. She eventually becomes addicted to these and things start to get bad.The four main heroes all start off with a dream. It goes well for a little while. Yet towards the end, the fate of each character spirals out of control, providing the twenty most brutal, depressing, harrowing and terrifying minutes ever put on film.This film will make you cry and might even make you feel mentally of psychically sick. It is indeed one of the most depressing films I have ever seen. It is also brutally honest which makes it all the scarier. Anyone thinking of taking drugs after watching this movie is an idiot.This movie focuses not on the drug dealers or the drugs or even the users. This movie's main focus is one word, addiction, and what an addiction can do to you. It shows the psychological affect behind addiction and what people are willing to do to get one more pill (or whatever their addiction might be).Aside from the pure emotional ride this movie will take you on, this movie is incredible in another way. The visuals are stunning; the entire way this movie was filmed and directed is just incredible. The acting is also top notch, especially Jennifer Connolly and Ellen Burstyn. The score is also amazing. The violin's playing throughout the movie are haunting and moving especially as they provide an up tempo haunting sound for the ending when the characters dreams come crashing down on them.This film is not for everyone. If you are squeamish or if you get upset very easily you might want to steer clear of this film, although you will be missing an incredible film. This movie will stick with you for a long time. This movie also gives a new meaning to addiction, so much so that you might not want to take another sip of that coffee sitting beside you.10/10",10,1,2,3 May 2005
Brokeback Mountain," What gay cowboy movie?
","To walk into Brokeback Mountain expecting to see what most ignorant people call 'the gay cowboy movie' would be massively underestimating this wonderful masterpiece by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon director Ang Lee. Brokeback Mountain follows a 20 year love affair between ranch handler Ennis Del Mar(Heath Ledger) and Texas Rodeo Cowboy Jack Twist(Jake Gylenhall). It's the summer of 1963 and Ennis and Jack are hired to go move a flock of sheep's over Brokeback Mountain. While up on the mountain alone the two unexpectedly fall in lover creating what would be a 20 year hidden love affair.What follows next is a movie that will move you and may even shatter you emotionally. Ang Lee shows he is a master with the camera as he directs every shot with perfection. And Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall give career defining performances. Accompinied with an unforgettable score composed by Gustavo Santaolalla and breathtaking cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto this film is one that will be talked about for decades to come and will go down in film history as groundbreaking and unforgettable.When true love grabs hold of you the best thing to do is grab back and hold on, because before you know it, it might be gone, like in Brokeback Mountain.I rate this film 9/10",9,18,20,19 February 2006
American Psycho," Great film, great satire.
","American Psycho is an amazing movie. It is a brilliant satire. The acting is amazing especially by Christian Bale. When you strip this movie down it is not about a serial killer. The movie has a much different and deeper meaning. In American Psycho, the dark 80's satire the message is very clear. In the 80's all the Wall Street Yuppies are the same. They only care about themselves. They all want to be perfect. Since none of them present their own personalities it is hard to distinguish them. This is why everyone confuses everyone else for other people. These people aren't all friends. They are all just using each other to get ahead. Patrick Bateman does not even know who he is. He questions his very existence. That is the first aspect of this film. The second thing is Patrick Bateman did indeed commit the murders. The only person who remotely cared about the murders was Detective Kimball. All of Patrick's friend's alibis said that he was there when in fact he wasn't. This is another example of mistaken identity. Nobody seems to care that Patrick murders. He makes it so clear to everyone but they are all just so occupied with their own lives that they don't care. At its core this movie is very similar to Wall Street. The point of this film isn't to show a serial killer killing people. It is to show that in the 80's on Wall Street most people were just obsessed with getting ahead and they didn't care about anything else. Patrick is just so annoyed with this normal lifestyle that he goes absolutely crazy and starts killing people. He already had problems to begin withÂ…yet a few things trigger him off and he goes crazy. He murders people because he wants to do something different he wants to be different from everyone else. Everyone he knows is the same type of person. That is the reason for all the mistaken identities. Although when no once even acknowledges his murders it drives him more crazy. This is why at the end he says ' My punishment has eluded me' meaning his punishment escapes him. He will never be punished because no one really acknowledged that he killed these people. Then he says 'My confession has meant nothing' meaning his confession didn't mean anything because no one cared. Well anyways I think I got the meaning of this movie right. I loved this movie. The acting is incredible. Especially Christian Bale.",9,0,1,7 August 2005
Casino Royale," Bond? Or just another action flick?
","What starts off as a promising Bond flick, takes a sharp turn down 'ugly' road as it progresses. As I sat down eagerly awaiting the new Bond flick, I didn't know what to expect. I have seen every Bond film and am a big fan. I was anxious to see the new Bond. And while I wasn't totally disappointed I wasn't completely impressed either.Starting off with a great opening scene then progressing through a cool opening credit sequence with a great song, and then going on to an awesome scene in Africa, Casino Royale starts off great! Yet that's the problem. It only starts off great.Daniel Craig is a new, different kind of Bond. Personally, I thought he was great. He is more of a strong silent type. Not to many witty remarks like Roger Moore and he isn't as classy as Pierce or Sean but he's right up there with Sean as one of the greatest Bonds.Unfortunately not even Craig could completely save this film. Right after the first 20 minutes is over the film spirals down. The plot is weak to say the least, the stakes never seem to high, the girl is to young for Bond and the villain isn't much of a threat.I miss the layered plot, the neat gadgets and the good BOnd girl and villain that we got in almost every other Bond flick.When it comes to plot, I pretty much could have turned on my TV to watch some World Series Poker, because essentially the plot revolves around Bond winning a poker game. Although this is one of the better poker scene I have seen in a movie and it was quite well done and intense.Another thing is that the action is hardly anywhere to be found, save for three scenes throughout the entire 2 and half hour movie there is basically no action, and the action that is there does not further the plot at all, it is kind of there just because it has to be. The plot was weak, thin, and had no depth.Neither Bond nor his allies never seemed to be put in high risk danger, there is never a lot at stake either.Eva Green would have been a good Bond girl if the part was written right. She comes in from absolutely no where, her character never serves any purpose in the story, it's only towards the end that the writers decided to throw her into the main story which really just confused things more rather than excite them.Last but not least is the villain. Le Chiffre is nothing compared to some of the great Bond villains. He is a henchman for the big boys. He's basically like a middle men, he holds money for the terrorist, he's not even a terrorist. He's not tough, evil or cruel. He also has medical conditions that are never explained (bloody tears?? the puffer he takes??) He is just not the diabolical villain I was hoping for. He is essentially a banker for bad guys.In the end though there is enough good to out-way the bad. Or at least balance it out. The first 20 minutes of the movie are simply fantastic( the first scene, the opening credits, the Africa scene) also all the poker scenes are very intense and well done. Daniel Craig shines as a different more darker type of Bond and he is great in the role. The action sequences that are there are fantastic, but there is just not enough action for a 2 and a half hour Bond movie. The movie might be missing some key Bond elements (girl, villain, action, gadgets) yet in the end when those mediocre elements are combined with some fantastic elements (Bond himself, the action that's there, opening credits, theme song, poker scenes) Casino Royale proves itself to be better than just a decent action flick, while it's not the Bond I was hoping for it wasn't the cheesy popcorn flick either. Like I said before there were some fantastic things about it, and some very bad things. Although when it comes down to it Casino Royal is a good Bond flick that will be remembered more for Daniel Craig as Bond rather than the villains, gadgets or girls.I give this 8/10",8,1,3,22 November 2006
V for Vendetta," People should not be afraid of their government, government should be afraid of their people.
","It is now August and I've seen em all. From An Inconvenient Truth to Da Vinci Code to Superman Returns to Miami Vice to Pirates of the Caribbean to Snakes on a Plane and to many more I've now seen all of the big movies and also some of the little ones that have come out from January to August of 06 and V for Vendetta is still the best I have seen all year.Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, V For Vendetta is essentially about a masked freedom fighter/terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving) who lives in Britain sometime not to soon from now. In around maybe 2020 I'd say. The country is run by a totalitarian/fascist government where everything and everyone is censored, controlled and watched according to the governments standards. V is the freedom fighter who rebels. Natalie Portman's character Evey is eventually dragged into V's rebellious/acts of terrorism that range from blowing up places to defying the government in every way possible and to his final act or rebellion which concludes the film. V sees what most people in this futuristic Britain don't that the government has used fear as the ultimate tool to gain total control of these people. V sees this and resents this. And further into the film we find out just really what the government did to turn Britain from a democratic country into a totalitarian/fascist country.To say anymore could spoil it and to spoil this film would be a crime.In a film that has many parallels to a lot of things in our world this totalitarian Britain might not be to far off for us. There is much to be found in the way of symbolism and allegories in this film.The dialog in this film is awesome, one such example is a brilliant monologue where almost every other word starts with a V, that V gives in one of the first scenes of this movie. Many quotes from this movie will really make you think and will stay with you for a while because they speak true to how our society could become in the future, maybe even 20-30 years from now.The acting by Natalie Portman is surprisingly good in this film considering she has been a bit off since Garden State in my opinion. Hugo Weaving although covered by a mask the entire film does a great job making you sympathize with this terrorist V as we see why he is like this. He also does a great job making V a poetic, intellectual, and passionate hero while still showing him as a ruthless and merciless killer. V is skilled in combat and the art of deception he is also a very very bright individual which makes him to be a great anti-hero.The direction is also top notch here by James McTeigue. Every shot looks good and the explosions are all great especially the final scene which is captured beautifully. To say more about the final scene would give it away.V For Vendetta has a lot to say about where it thinks society is going and my what a scary place the world will be if we are ever run by a government like the one in this movie. By a government who issues curfews, has only on TV station censored by them, who monitors families conversations, who's every bit of media has to be passed through them etc.This movie is not just an action movie yet it's a social critique which has resounding similarities to the book 1984 by Orson Wells. In the end V For Vendetta comes out as a smart, dramatic action thriller that begs to ask the question is it considered terrorism if you know that what you are doing is right?",9,0,1,27 August 2006
