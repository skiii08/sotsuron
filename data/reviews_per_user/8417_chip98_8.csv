E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Space-shuttle astronauts?
","What more can be said?  But some scenes are irksome or unexplainable.  I mean, come on, how many films aimed primarily at kids have one brother call another brother 'penis-breath'?  (Makes me wish we still had the Hayes Commission.) And what about this head-scratcher: when the Feds finally close in on E.T. they burst into Elliot's house in what appear to be actual space-suits (not just bio-protection suits) clearly marked with NASA Space Shuttle patches.  What was Spielberg trying to tell us here, and why didn't it get across?",Null,0,0,2 December 1998
Shakespeare in Love," Hard to beat
","Really extraordinary.  Won 1998 Best Picture and deserved it but for 'Saving Private Ryan,' which should have gotten the nod but wow, tough call. Everything works here (that soundtrack!), but strangely enough, the best is the ending-titles scene--Viola, alone, marooned, crossing the beach of a new world, a figment of Shakespeare's imagination but no less a bitter and true allegory.  Gwynneth Paltrow as Viola is a performance that goes beyond description; a fantastic and ethereal presence that is surely what secured Best Picture, and who's complaining?  The critics called 'Shakespeare in Love' a 'must-see', and for once they were right.",Null,0,1,23 January 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Sleepy, and hollow
","'Sleepy Hollow' is a pretty accurate moniker for this version of Washington Irving's classic tale--it can make you sleepy, and it is hollow.Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane is way out of his depth here; whether by sheer inexperience, bad direction or bad writing, it is hard to tell.  Likely one of the last two, as the accomplished actress Christina Ricci scarcely comes off any better and it is such a shame.  There is too much melodrama, too much glowering and too much over-acting, all of which crushes any attempt at subtlety, if any was intended.  Some of it is plain ridiculous, and none of it scary for anyone over age ten or with an I.Q. over 70.  (Its good points: lavish scenery, and an impressive but-all-too-brief appearance by a very evil-looking Christopher Walken as the head-hungry Hessian Horseman.)And that's just the first hour.  I simply could not bother to watch the rest.",Null,1,1,27 June 2000
Notting Hill," A 1999 must-see.
","One of the purest examples of cinematic escapism, and no criticism meant; a romantic comedy for the Everyman and all of it quite plausible.The role of super-actress Anna Scott is Julia Roberts' best performance since 'The Pelican Brief,' perhaps her best, period. We see Anna as William Thacker sees her (Hugh Grant), a luminous and fantastic interloper into the day-to-day humdrum, her every close-up a blaze of unreal beauty and we almost feel sorry for the guy--could even a real-life Hugh Grant deal with her?  (Nevermind the rest of us, poor losers of the genetic lottery.)  But sometimes goddesses *do* descend from Olympus (it isn't all paradise up their, either), and if Anna can find salvation in the ordinary and average, so can we.  Even the below-mediocre will have their day; would that all slackers and derelicts had the charm of the out-to-lunch Spike, Thacker's roomie (an impeccable Rhys Ifans).  Spike is a scene-stealer and never before has a funnier low-life ever graced the screen, so-to-speak.But such stories can never be ours.  So we buy tickets to the nearest thing possible, and sometimes it is worth it and other times not, but 'Notting Hill' very much so.And Julia, if you are reading this--would you care to have dinner with me sometime?  ;)",Null,0,0,23 January 2000
Doctor Zhivago," Top o' the list
","An easy rival with 'Gone With the Wind' for all-time best picture, and *is* the better film, at least to this reviewer.  David Lean is at his best--like a fine jeweler, he made sure every cast member's performance is a flawlessly cut gem, and every gem perfectly mounted and set.  Though Russophiles and native Russians might find the mannerisms a tad western and the monolithic finale of the hydroelectric dam reminiscent of Soviet party-line flicks, there is absolutely nothing else wrong.  A true cinematic 'epic.'",10,0,0,14 March 1999
Platoon," One of our best war flicks.
","To me, this was a surprise from Oliver 'Reagan-is-a-fascist' Stone.  One of the few Vietnam flicks that gives a fair account of what it's like to fight on the ground in a war run by strategy-free nitwits, though Mr. Stone probably didn't intend it that way.  The personal conflicts and dilemmas come across as real and plausible, without the usual Hollywood pacifist moralizing--until we get Charlie Sheen's sentimental (and dead wrong) voice-over at the very end.  (Historical note: some of the marquee posters for Platoon advertised a story from America's 'bloodiest and most unpopular' war.  Neither description is true.)",10,1,1,13 January 1999
Heat," A terrific must-see
","Gritty and realistic, with superb turn-outs by all involved.  I couldn't take my eyes off Ashley Judd (as Christine Sheherlis), and not just for her looks.  An intricate plot intertwined with well-crafted action keeps the story going (the bank heist shoot-out is an eye-popper).  DeNiro and Pacino are their usual (if predictable) best, but the surprise is Val Kilmer, playing his role with fine subtlety.  If they ever devise retroactive Oscars for casting, then let Bonnie Timmermann be the first recipient.",10,1,2,4 January 1999
The Thin Red Line," The Thin Plot Line
","What if John Wayne and Oliver Stone had together made a film about the invasion of Guadalcanal?  What would you get? Something like 'The Thin Red Line.'Or maybe something better--focus, cohesive plot, and characters worth sympathy.  'Thin Red Line' has almost none of that.  What *is* worthwhile is its dispassionate exam of the demoralizing; no matter how evil the enemy or how 'good' the war, war is still hell.  It is however a pity (and waste of talent) that combat's winnowing of the courageous and strong from the marching hordes of the average doesn't get across to us.  Courage is instead mere naivete or disguised desperation, and strength a kind of  inevitable brutality, and as interesting as all that might be by itself we still get a barely engaging story.  Throw in a slew of sensual but too-vague flashbacks, battle scenes only above-average and an aftermath straight out of Oliver Stone of the capture of a Japanese base camp, and soon the demoralized characters demoralize the audience. This is no 'Saving Private Ryan.'Strong performances from all involved, especially from Penn and Nolte, and from Harrelson were it not for a role brief as a cameo, casualty of a weak plot.  The lush scenery is a big help, too.  Not much else does.  And when it all ends, as the victors depart Guadalcanal and a job not very well done, it is more evaporation than ending.",Null,0,0,18 June 2000
