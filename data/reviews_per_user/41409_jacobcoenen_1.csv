The New World," NO more movies with Colin Ferrell
","I gave Colin Ferrell some credit going into this movie. I saw Alexander, Swat, and phone booth. This movie is by far his worst. I took my wife to this movie last night and we almost walked out. She likes chick flicks and I like action movies. When we heard about this movie we both thought that it would satisfy both our needs. We were WRONG!!! The movie is SO boring I lost interest less then half way threw. Their is only one fighting scene (that was mediocre) and the 'love story' is terrible.The only thing that I did like was the location. Instead of watching the 'plot' I thought to myself how I would like to go fishing and hunting where they were.SO PLEASE DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!!! I wouldn't tell you to wait until it comes to video or cable. JUST DON'T WATCH IT.",1,6,18,22 January 2006
