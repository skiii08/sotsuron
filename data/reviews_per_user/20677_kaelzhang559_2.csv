Iron Man 3," Bad
","Sacrifice the arch-nemesis of Iron Man for such a minor character is BAH. Such as making Thanos a hologram of some toddler in the Avengers 2. Yes it's going to be a bigger twist but will you like it? I won't deny Talia is weak, even in the movie. TDKR is the final one of the trilogy, she is too weak for the final antagonist, both in strength and persona. She doesn't have her goal and motive like Ra's Al Ghul and the Joker, she was simply following her dad's step, wanted to avenge him, even the organization was her dad's legacy.I think let her father return would be better since he fit better as the final antagonist of the trilogy as the creator of LoS and his character was established very well in BB, his relationship with Bruce is also much deeper.However, let's not forget, Talia is not the arch-nemesis of Batman, before we went half way through TDKR we don't see much of her presence, and she didn't take too much credits from Bane. The Mandarin is different. The 'Ten Rings' showed up in the first Iron Man movie, some organization also backed up Whiplash. So many people wanted to see the Mandarin, Jon Favreau even was asked about it and he said he wanted to make the Mandarin like the Emperor in SW OT. During Iron Man 3's production, not many people care about Guy's character, but the Mandarin confirmed is a big news.Would it be boring? If they made a vote for the antagonist between Alrich Kilian and the Mandarin for Iron Man 3, it would have been a landslide result. Nobody wants to see some minor character replace the arch-nemesis as the antagonist, for some dumb twist that has been used quite a few times.Yeah I blamed enough about the Mandarin, and now the twist is totally unnecessary. Unlike Ras' Al Ghul in BB or Talia in TDKR. We knew Aldrich Killian is a bad guy from the flashback, it's way too obvious, even Tony himself mentioned he created demons. What's the point to ruin the Mandarin and make him from the 2nd bad guy the biggest bad guy? Also if he was the leader of the Ten Rings, why didn't he start his revenge when his minions captured Tony in the first one? And beside he does not have any connection with the comic Mandarin beside his tattoo, he does not have rings' power, he is not Asian, he's super stupid as a villain.Remember the bald guy who works for Killian? That guy followed him to see Pepper, many many people were there and saw him with Killian. And later he showed his power, publicly to people on the street! What the heck is this? I remember the explosion of that minion is an accident, even if it wasn't, people were already running away when the bald guy started to use his power, there surely would be some survivors to tell the security the tale. Not to say later that bald guy showed up again, using his power to melt the water tank and tried to kill Tony publicly, also many people saw it. Once this was known by the US government or Tony, he would easily be able to identified and his boss would be revealed for sure. Killian even told Pepper about Extremis, he could not get away. That's just super stupid! Also later, why didn't Tony let his armors to just fly up the sky and shoot down every of those Killian's minions? They were strong and got fire power, but they couldn't fly or jump that high. Tony also could just fly up and shoot Killian to pieces, all he had to worry to would just be some flame(maybe he wouldn't even have to worry about it because Killian might not be able to shot fire that high).Overall it's just stupid to ruin the Mandarin and make some retarded guy, who was not even a villain in the comic to be the final, antagonist, of the final piece of the trilogy!",4,4,8,4 May 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," My taste
","Overall it's pretty good. Except Hathaway, she looks too weak when she's not smiling, her catwoman role is also a bit too weak. Some flaws The police is still dumb(allow a company to build such a dangerous nuclear reactor with almost no guard, the entire city's police easily got trapped), but how come Batman also become retarded at some point? He got those tranquilizer weapons and used it in the movie, why didn't he use it against Bane? It could easily take down him.Also obviously that Bane is like Doomsday, he's a dreadful and strong fighter but not suitable as a cunning criminal mind. So that's why he was linked to the league of shadow first then later revealed he was just a pawn of Ra's al Ghul's real child. They both simply want to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's wish. Then why didn't bring Ra's al Ghul back as the antagonist? He's powerful, cunning, got tons of elite assassins. He also once was a mentor figure of Batman, that's perfect for the antagonist of the whole trilogy.",8,1,3,22 July 2012
