Sucker Punch," Yes, Boy!
","What can I say. I sat for the whole time wondering what would happen next.This film is perfection, we knew from the outset what the end would be, but for the whole time I hoped I was wrong.Zach Snyder used the 'It Was All a Dream' with precision. It wasn't a dream at all. It was a fantasy wrapped around what actually occurred. And if her fantasy was of being in a whore house, what were the real terrors they had to endure in the ward. This is confirmed to us when the Orderly said that he wasn't going to help the girls any more.I watched the movie about an hour ago, and I cannot stop attempting to translate the fantasy back into reality. As I think about it now, I think that every time she dances, this is actually the time when she is being abused.A perfect use of CGI. Loads of it, and mixing images of war from across time and legends. I love the huge detailed backdrops just like the films by Kazuaki Kiriya; Casshern and Goemon.I left the cinema feeling a little sad. Great movie that has everything!Zach Snyder, can you please remake Shogun Island(Raw Force), you did a great job with Dawn of the Dead. Thanks.",8,4,7,6 April 2011
Dawn of the Dead," Had to watch it... wasnt disapointed.
","One of my all time favourite movies is Dawn of the Dead.  Image the mixed feelings I had when I first heard of the remake.   It was going to go one of two ways...Seeing that the original DOTD was an allegorical tale about consumerism, and that it was set in the shopping mall for this very reason, I was a little concerned that this was going to be a poor copy.  The good news was it wasn't.The only similarity between the two movies was the shopping centre.  The zombies, where completely different.  I guess this movie could have been entitled something completely different but with marketing the way it is I guess a pseudo remake is going to bring in more dosh.Anyway... the movie is more like a cross between DOTD and 28 Days Later; it had me on the edge of my seat, and made me jump more than once - to many. After a night of restless sleep I say good work Zack Snyder, you've directed one of the best horror movies in a long time.This film is not Citizen Kane, and it never aspires to be, so don't talk to me about 2 dimensional characters.  This is a high quality horror movie. Big effects, big budgets with a huge fear factor. Go see this film with an open mind.  For die hard fans of the original there are cameos from Ken Foree and Tom 'I see you chocolate man' Savini.Oh and one final line, '.shoot Burt Reynolds'  I tell you, I nearly wet my pants!!",Null,0,0,27 March 2004
