Vertigo," Vertigo gives The Master's best.
","Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, one of the most unnerving psychological thrillers ever made, began climbing the annals after Hitchcock's death until reaching first in the prestigious British Sight & Sound magazine's Top 50 Films of All Time in September 2012. With the distinguished eerie tune by Bernard Herrmann, whose very first film, remarkably, was Citizen Kane, Hitchcock, The Master of Suspense, encompasses the real world with a mystery supposedly from the supernatural. With outstanding performances from Kim Novak and Jimmy Stewart (though I still can't get over his disproportionate walk), Vertigo turns the familiar murder-mystery story into an enthralling masterpiece of love, money and a lot of tall, dizzying stairs.Legendary actor Jimmy Stewart plays John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a San Francisco detective who, after a police falls to his death attempting to help him on a rooftop, has been released from police duty due to his acrophobia, or fear of heights. However, shipping businessman Gavin Elster later discovers and hires Scottie's detective hand to follow his twenty-six year old wife as he suspects supernatural occurrences that he claims that the dead visits his wife and drives her in drastic behaviors. Tailing her, he witnesses her mad wanderings and discovers that she ties her hair and collects the same flower as a woman from a painting in the Palace of the Legions of Honor. However, this is not enough to dub it more than a coincidence. Dexterously, he quickly learns that the twenty-six year-old Madeleine hears cries to suicide from this woman. Soon, however, he later quickly unearths the woman as Carlotta Valdes, also a suicidal at age twenty-six.Though rated PG in almost all of the re-releases, the 1999 Digital version I viewed contained a PG-13 rating, which is far more fitting for the heavy elements and themes of death in the film. In fact, even from the opening credits, Hitchcock brings out the dreads and surprises. Filmed in essentially every historic site in and around San Francisco, Vertigo gives many long smooches and innuendos as well as some 'suicide' attempts and disturbing constituents, specifically an extremely tense nightmare and the Carlotta Valdes picture which Hitchcock gradually managed, throughout the course of the film, to put a bit of sinister in it.With his forty-fifth feature film, Hitchcock again proves himself as The Master. Though it all comes clear at the end, this tour de force will be frightening to young viewers, but it would be a piece of Sherlock Holmes for high school level viewers. Though it may be slow and plodding in the first hour when Scottie trails Madeleine Elster in his car, it soon catches on with Hitchcock's masterful storytelling along with the suspenseful and mystic truth. With each suicide attempt, failed rescues and an ending with the horrid, though common truth, Vertigo gives The Master's best.",10,4,5,3 January 2016
Citizen Kane," The most influential film ever.
","'What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?' When viewing this film, I immediately paralleled Mark 8:36 to Citizen Kane. Considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest, films of all time, Citizen Kane, which also revolutionized film cinematography, told truth about life that love cannot be gained by money. Assuredly, the film's remarkable excellences in every respect attest the addition of my perfect score to the already sky-high positive reviews of critics and audiences.Based on the newspaper publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who also is credited for triggering the Spanish-American war, Citizen Kane begins with Kane's final, dying, 'Rosebud.' Inquisitively, a curious reporter by the name of Thompson hopes to solve the mystery around the word and its meaning by interrogating friends and family of Kane. During these interviews, Kane's life unfolds in flashbacks as we see him possessing, with high hopes, his rich guardian's failing newspaper, which he quickly expands into an empire of thirty-seven nationwide newspapers under his unique techniques. But he wanted more; he wanted to be loved by everyone, adored by everyone, a governor, a household name. He just could not be content with what he was; he had to be bigger.Without doubt, Orson Welles, the director, producer and screenwriter, also masterfully played this unique Kane, the rajah of the American society. As it was openly frowned upon during the Golden Age of films, little negative content appears Citizen Kane. Even though the plot revolves fairly around adultery, it is only mentioned slightly in newspaper headlines and characters' monologues. Also, young viewers may find the film boring as the message is told in a style that might be above their level.What if I said that 'Rosebud' was his childhood sled? I revealed absolutely nothing about this unique, troubled life, as Thompson mentioned at the near the end, 'Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost. No, I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life. No - I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece.' Kane, a man who wanted love on his own 'terms,' failed to understand in his 'terms' that in receiving love, love needs to be given. With this deep and powerful message, this piece of art has been ingrained into history as the most influential film ever, and it will easily become a family favorite.",10,5,6,3 January 2016
Home Alone," Home Alone is an engaging, heart-felt annual tradition.
","'I don't want any family. Families suck!' Producer Mark Levinson said that once in a while, every kid thinks that if they could get rid of their parents and vice versa, life would be great. Chris Columbus's 1990 hit Christmas film, Home Alone, shapes that wish into a clever tale with the addition of burglars. Left home alone, Kevin, the eight-year old victim of sibling bullying, becomes the man of the deserted household, and like a responsible child, enjoys everything once forbidden by his parents, washes the clothes, shops for milk and dinner, and defends the house, with all the wild resourcefulness a child can muster, against a pair of burglars who are fishing for 'Silver Tuna' homes during the holidays. Home Alone is a well- written tale with clever booby traps, comical, lumbering burglars and strong family values.Unfortunately, this film is not completely laudable in both content and quality. Due to Kevin's deterring, but simple snares, mildly-strong language is steadily and sporadically spouted out by the angry bandits with Kevin rejoining every so often to discourage them. Also, Kevin, his siblings and other family members repeatedly name-call each other near the beginning. A classic for (most) ages, the entertaining plot held me on the edge of my seat, while keeping me laughing and wincing at the asinine sufferings of the bandits. But however well-written the script and storyline was, I downright detested the unpleasant acting, chiefly of Kevin and his family. Although a couple veteran actors made appearances in it, even their performances were particularly rotten. Excepting Joe Pesci's convincing performance as Harry Lime, the dreadful awkwardness of blank and unemotional neophyte actors constantly diverted my attention away from the themes of the film. I've mentioned theme and plot frequently. Written by John Hughes, the characters of the film, though some appear useless to the film's plot, fit flawlessly into the importance of the film. For instance, Old Man Marley seems to be just another object of dread and fright for Kevin, but throughout the course of the film, we learn the truth about him along with many life-lessons exchanged between them. Although slightly overused by family movies, the positive elements in this film are quite strong and emphasized, significantly engulfing the expletives and violence, hence earning my high content rating. When they discover the loss of their child, Kevin's mother, Kate (Catherine O'Hara), expresses her remorse and love as she sacrifices all her possessions and sleep while she attempts to return alone to their home in Chicago with caring donors providing transportation for every leg. Scored by John Williams, Home Alone's memorable 'Somewhere in My Memory' yet again illustrates these ideals. While not the best acted or produced Christmas flick, the superb plot, humor, lessons and implications make Home Alone an engaging, heart-felt annual tradition.",8,0,0,3 January 2016
Empire of the Sun," Unlike Jurassic Park, Spielberg enhances the original material, and touches it with emotion, friendships and an inspirational story.
","Quality: 9/10 Content: 7.5/10 There is a scene in Spielberg's film adaption of J. G. Ballard's novel, Empire of the Sun, where an imprisoned boy by the name of Jim salutes and sings the heart-piercing 'Suo Gân' to three Kamikaze pilots in their pre- flight ritual. This little airplane enthusiast has no care – more specifically, he doesn't know – of the class and physical barriers that separated Japan and their captives. He respects and cares for all; everyone is equal in his innocent eyes. He salutes, befriends and surrenders to Japanese and American alike without a thought of wires or possible consequences, and everyone, even the brutal Japanese sergeant Nagata, enjoys his presence with a certain respect and adoration for him. Like the author J. G. Ballard's own experiences, Jim, or James Graham (Christian Bale's first major role that brought him into the limelight), lives in the untouched International Settlement in Shanghai before Japan invaded it, while his well-to-do parents keep him oblivious to the intense nature of the war raging outside the metal barricades of the settlement. When the Japanese do finally march in, Jim and his parents are separated by the great throngs of chaotic crowds. Jim now has to survive on his own until he runs into a strange, snobbish American, Basie, whom he persuades to protect him. The war moves on, and our characters are moved to the Soochow camp, but we don't care as it makes no difference to unenlightened Jim. Spielberg definitely succeeds in creating movies on World War II, and like any other of them, the oppressors bring down numerous beatings, though Spielberg curbed it to a PG rating, and mild language is spit out in intense, emotional scenes. Though Jim loudly proclaims his atheistic faith, his beliefs are radically different. He talks about God and what he does, possibly a touch in order to appeal to Christian viewers. Throughout the movie, the tween-aged Jim often cries 'I surrender' to anyone in a uniform, hoping to gain access to his parents or a guardian through that act. But I doubt little Jim understands that phrase, because, instead of a weak, fainthearted boy, we see one with a strong constitution and standing up to oppressors and respecting all (even the dead). Even in conditions so arduous and severe, his manners and respect last through the entire war, recognized by us and an admiring Basie who says, 'You've got nice manners. I appreciate that.' Spielberg's powerful use of the camera and Bale's show-stopping performance emphasizes what man would do in harsh and demanding environments. On the other hand, Jim, scraping out a living through a complex network of theft and trade, lives unknowing to the motives behind the cruelties of the camp in his high world of airplanes. We follow Jim and his experiences like a close friend, but like everyone else, we can't convince him of the real dangers and truths he is ignorant of. Unlike Jurassic Park, Spielberg enhances the original material, and touches it with emotion, friendships and an inspirational story.",9,3,7,3 March 2016
The Princess Bride," The Princess Bride definitively lives up to all its 'inconceivableness.'
","I knew I wouldn't get away without mentioning this classic. Seeing this film for the umpteenth time, I couldn't help but continue to marvel at all the artistic prowess given to make this film. Even the worst aspect of the film, its flat-out fake sets, enhances the sensation of a timeless fairytale. Perhaps it begins like a typical fairy tale about a peasant girl and a marriage, but soon, Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride quickly side- steps and beats its own trail with a quick twist of evil and amazing subplots. A personal favorite and acclaimed classic, Princess Bride contains many of the most quoted lines ever in the history of film along with memorably choreographed duels and rich characters.Westley (Cary Elwes, an unknown actor who later went on to star in other popular films, a dashing farm boy, falls in love with a peasant girl, Buttercup (Robin Wright). Sadly, a misfortune takes him, leaving Buttercup broken-hearted, even when an arrogant and conceited Prince Humperdinck (Christopher Guest) discovers and chooses her as his bride. However, before the marriage, she is kidnapped by three eccentric, disproportionate pirates: Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), the leader; Fezzik (André the Giant), the clumsy, wisdom-speaking idiot; and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), the wisest of the three.Then, like typical fairy tales, it poses the question that can be readily answered with a 'no': is Westley actually dead? He, disguised in black, chases these three desperadoes to recover his lost love in a perilous hunt. During this exhausting journey to fight back for his love, we observe a good number of passionate kisses (hey, it's a romance) and hilariously scripted and well-choreographed duels (enough to make you forget of the horrific set pieces), though none are as frightening as the Forest and Westley's torture scenes as the undertakings are slightly painful and disturbing. But as we receive the assuring company of a grandfather narrating the story to us, it helps soothe the anxiety of the tale. But then again, an unexpected strong obscenity near the end is heard. However, due to its characteristic fairy tale formula, its virtues surely dwarfed the negative as it allowed the clear distinction between good and evil with the respective, evident deeds of each side shining.Still, this already colorful film is sprinkled by colorful subplots, like Inigo's father and revenge, fitting in perfectly and even aiding the story. Maybe Vizzini's famous 'inconceivable!' may have been blown up by fans into one whole subplot itself already. As one of the few films I own, I rank this among my favorites. As the narrator in the trailer truthfully states, it's 'not just your basic, average, every day, ordinary, one-of-the-mill, ho-hum fairytale.' Whether seeing this for the first or millionth time, with or without a loved one, The Princess Bride definitively lives up to all its 'inconceivableness.'",10,1,2,22 February 2016
Amadeus," Displace one note and there would be diminishment. Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall.
","His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. So declared Antonio Salieri, 'Patron Saint of All Mediocrities,' friend of Mozart and mutual enemy of God in the impassioned and penetrating Amadeus. Milos Forman's Amadeus film version of a Peter Shaffer play of the same name based on a novel take on a rumor originating from the life of Mozart shook the world and nabbed eight Oscars the following year, including Best Picture. After being reproduced in many forms, could it even portray Mozart as truthful and powerful as the man really was? Frankly, no. No retelling of this genius' life can ever surpass the depth and power of Mozart's original story and life, but Amadeus gets awfully close to it. After reading the stage play and the film's screenplay, I felt that this movie was simply the luckiest achievement in film ever. The music, one of the best aspects of Amadeus (supplied entirely from Mozart's own compositions and performed by the prolific St. Martin in the Fields with conductor Sir Neville Marriner), creates a perfect dramatic effect while sampling a conception of Mozart's genius. Now, after viewing Forman's film, I visualize Mozart's music – the drama, the context, and the inspiration behind the music. Listening to Mozart's music now, each note and phrase triggers a memory of certain shots and emotions from the amazing insight Forman and Shaffer gave in Amadeus. Retelling his story to a priest, Salieri recounted his conceited boyish prayer with God: 'Lord, make me a great composer. Let me celebrate Your glory through music and be celebrated myself. Make me famous through the world, dear God. Make me immortal. After I die, let people speak my name forever with love for what I wrote. In return, I will give You my chastity, my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life, Amen.' Years later, Salieri, now an Austrian court composer in the service of Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), saw with sense of betrayal God's creation of Mozart. He knew Mozart's music was great, and his own was not. This fact alone did not worry him; it was the fact that Mozart was a coarse and vulgar boy. Often, he had talked and prayed to a cross hanging on his wall, but once his contempt overflowed, he gave it one last prayer and gazed at it once last time – ablaze in his fireplace: Because You will not enter me, with all my need for you; because You scorn my attempts at virtue; because You choose for Your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty infantile boy and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the Incarnation; because You are unjust, unfair, unkind, I will block You! I swear it! I will hinder and harm Your creature on earth as far as I am able. I will ruin Your Incarnation.' Ironically, although Salieri named himself virtuous and worthy of being God's 'Incarnation,' the vulgar Mozart held a closer relationship to God -- even having a certain fear and respect of Him, of which Salieri had none. But taking on the action he had sworn to do, he held Mozart in his deadly grasp, gradually sucking away his money, sanity, life, and finally, his music.With a perfect balance of words, Shaffer crafted the infamous Salieri, whom F. Murray Abraham played with intensity, and surprised us with his remarkable transition between a bitter, yet free, elderly Salieri and a quiet and calculating, thickly accented younger Salieri. No one -- not even I -- would have thought the two Salieris were played by the same actor. Abraham speaks Shaffer's words with such resonance and a sense of illustriousness that they stand out in our minds, seeming as though his words alone had an impact on history. Never before or after Amadeus had a movie effectively portray an iconic classical music figure without ruining the drama and comedy. Most of us view Mozart as an indomitable demigod-like music figure -- even if we know as a fact that Mozart was crude, barmy and ill-mannered -- but we could never comprehend that Mozart was an actual living vulgarity. Indifferently, Forman and Shaffer tore to shreds the demi-god character of Mozart and gave room for him to shine his crudity. Many have complained about the historical inaccuracies of Amadeus, especially the ending scene where Salieri takes a dictation from Mozart for his Requiem. However, as Shaffer explained in the introduction of his stage play, he changed the ending for dramatic effects. Amadeus is not a biopic; it is a historical-fiction exploring the realms of humanity, hatred and God. Forman and Shaffer left many varied and clear-cut messages in Amadeus. Some say Salieri's downfall was caused by either his jealousy or the haughty demand in his childhood prayer, explaining why God attempted to destroy Salieri – both great points and interpretations. But I believe that the explanation of God's wrath on Salieri is more objective. In his childhood prayer, he prayed for talent, and 'In return, I will give You my chastity, my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life' But as none of those qualities were evident in the film, he earned that punishment. But wasn't Salieri's request for a righteous man to have the musical talent an honorable request? Perhaps. And perhaps God did fulfill that request, just through a different, yet pious and talented, Austrian: Franz Joseph Haydn.",10,1,2,4 April 2016
La La Land," There is no film like La La Land
","The opening shot of La La Land shows us a jammed highway of Los Angeles on a (snowless and warm) winter morning. Almost as if caused by the evident claustrophobia, everyone exits their cars and, on cue, sings us their individual stories. This is Los Angeles, the land where dreams are made and destroyed. People hop on cars, dance in sync for miles and miles, and play instruments out in the open like nobody cares. Magnificent. This is what the rest of the movie's going to feel like.Go back and read my first sentence again. I said 'opening shot.' Yes, the entire opening scene is one whole goshdanged shot. The entire movie is made out of long shots. Most of the time, longshots don't work well other than to show off some technical feat; they make you feel like you're holding your breath for an unnecessarily long time. On the other hand, La La Land's opening shot is like letting out a breath.This shot sets up the chaotic atmosphere of the first meeting between Mia and Sebastian. But it's not how your typical friendship would start: Sebastian honks his horn at Mia with the what-the-heck look; Mia gives him the birdie and returns the what-the-heck look.After that encounter we follow Mia around in her daily life. She's an employee at a café in a major studio's lot trying to make her big break in acting. Beginning with the incident on the highway, her day hasn't been going too well. And after a party that frustrates her more than enlivens her—a funless event that ends with her car being towed—she follows a wisp of beautiful piano music that drags her inside a bar where she encounters the pianist: Sebastian.Here we jump back to their first encounter in the morning, but this time, instead of following Mia this time, we follow Sebastian and note his daily life, too. He's a jazz pianist struggling to pay his bills while his one job is in a bar playing boring Christmas songs that nobody wants to hear and he doesn't want to play. Then, in a feat of both emotional bravo and idiocy, he plays an unassigned piece, consequently getting him fired. Mia approaches him, but he violently brushes past her. It's like they were meant for each other but they don't think so.The story's simple. Plot twist or surprises are lacking. It's a path that goes up and down the bumpy road of their lives. A guy and girl meet, but their careers make their relationship to struggle. Should they follow their dreams, or sacrifice their dreams to spend time with each other? The story builds(or descends, depends on how you look at it) in small episodes that lead the tension to a depressing finale. Each episode is a link in a chain, not a piece of a puzzle where the story calls back the earlier scenes for an important event.The finale is surprising at first, but—think about it—it appears that the movie has been leading up to it the whole time—we just didn't see it coming because we hoped so much it wouldn't happen.Director Damien Chazelle obsession with music is very evident, not only in the film but also within his career. His directorial debut was a musical much like La La Land; he made his sophomore product about a drummer and his violently dedicated band leader; he wrote a screenplay about a pianist who has to play a concert perfectly or else. Through his dedication that soaks through this dream project, La La Land soars beautifully.Justin Hurwitz, Chazelle's college roommate, composes a score so vibrantly rooted in the old musicals yet engrained with that modern 21st- century intensity (he had supposedly sent 1,900 piano demos to Chazelle before settling on... six songs). This is a guy to keep an eye out for.There is no film like La La Land. Thinking revolutionary like Les Miserables? Or bombastic like West Side Story? Or oddly magical like Wizard of Oz?This is the best way I can put it: it's all the great movie musicals and romances you have seen, but, at the same time, it's not. Though it borrows heavily from almost every classic, it is unique in its entirety. Don't miss this movie. Some of you probably heard me quote this paragraph from The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, and I can't stress it enough:'Catch the film on the largest screen you can find, with a sound system to match, even if that means journeying all day. Have a drink beforehand. And, whatever you do, don't wait for a DVD or a download. The mission of this movie will be fulfilled only if it is seen by those—especially kids—  who may not know what busy thrills can bloom, without recourse to violence, from the simplest things.'You won't have another chance to see it in theaters until—maybe—it's rereleased into theaters in a couple years. But by then, it'll be too late and regret will not be enough to compensate your missed opportunity.",10,8,13,19 December 2016
WALL·E," Another good robot and Pixar movie
","There are two ways to view the future through sci-fi lenses: the mechanical wow-ness of a space world, or a dusty, human-less Earth. In Wall-E, another Pixar hit, the Earth is dusty and human-less, except that humans currently live in space and Earth is covered in garbage. The humans, after evacuating in a luxurious spaceship, christened the Axiom, leave behind tiny clean-up machines, Wall-Es (Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth-Class), to collect, compress and stack the garbage into skyscrapers. One big problem is that most of the Wall-Es have rusted and broken, but the bigger problem is that no human, who now live on hoverchairs and are made up of just fat and (almost) no bones, remembers them. But they are not entirely forgotten. After a long day at work for Wall-E, the humans send a reconnaissance robot named EVE to find evidence that there is life on Earth. After completing her 'directive,' she is retrieved by the Axiom and a heartbroken and devastated Wall-E follows her onto the ship. This vital evidence, a tiny plant found in a worn-out shoe, balances the future of the lazy, fat humans. Oscar-winning director and writer Andrew Stanton gloriously adds another star to Pixar almost as valuable Toy Story. With dazzling colors and top- notch animation, Wall-E's intensity is far from severe but still demonstrates the teamwork and devotion of the captain, humans, Wall-E and EVE as they battle the mutinous autopilot of the Axiom. At times when it seems hopeless for Wall-E and EVE, Pixar shows us how friends stick up for each other, not just in sunny days, but also in rainy days.",9,0,1,16 October 2015
The Iron Giant," A Great Rusty Joint for all ages.
","A boy finds this creature from outer space, teaches it about the world, tries but fails to convince anyone about his discovery and later the government attempts to hunt down the creature. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial right? Yes, and no. Though very similar and a lot less content worries, The Iron Giant, set in the 1950s when the Russians had just deployed the Sputnik into space, distinguishes itself from E.T. by one, 100 ft. metal man. Sent from outer space to be 'a weapon' to destroy humans, the Iron Giant is remarkably friendly to humans. He soon befriends an 11 year-old pet- addicted boy, Hogarth,who had saved him from a close-to-death electrocution during the Giants feast on the metal of an electric station. Lonely for a companion, Hogarth visits the Giant and teaches him about the world. Thus begins the mental journey of the Iron Giant into the world of humans. Meanwhile, the government is called up about some weird discoveries. They send an agent by the name of Kent Mansley to investigate. He first dismisses the idea of a metal-eating Giant as too eccentric, but then after finding his car with a huge bite and a second later vanished completely, he calls the government which instructs him to find more evidence. Immediately, Kent suspects Hogarth and after many annoying and desperate inquiries he discovers a picture of Hogarth and the Giant. The next day, the army is in their backyard. The Iron Giant, rated PG for some violence, some bathroom humor and a bunch too many swears and misuses of God's name, is both hilarious but also heartbreaking, yet unlike many animation films, viewers will find its message comparably heavy and touching deeply on the truth of death and souls. There is one thing I disliked though. Every scene all are straight to the point and are never out of place. It would could have been extended by 15 more minutes and still prove the important points. Frankly, although the story is not new to most of us, The Iron Giant easily bests the others in creativity and spiritual truth (but not all on family-friendly content). Just as Hogarth says to the Giant, 'You don't have to be a gun. You are what you choose to be,' we should not base ourselves on what others believe and want us to be.

Jurassic Park," Well-made, but a typical action flick at its core.
","Quality: 7.5/10 Content: 6/10 Before Jurassic World and two other sequels, there was Jurassic Park twenty-two years ago. It's good, to say the least, but not great -- well- made, but a typical action flick at its core. Though Spielberg really wished to induce amazement, he introduced the dinosaurs quite too early, mollifying the awe the characters - whom we have known for no more than ten minutes – display (and we should have felt). Based on the renowned Michael Crichton novel, Spielberg, David Keopp, and Crichton himself cut the story down to a simple and bloody nightmare.We meet Dr. Grant, a dinosaur paleontologist (a power-filled performance by Sam Neil), and his fiancée and assistant, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) working on a dinosaur excavation site. In a surprise visit, a mysterious, eccentric billionaire park owner, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), asks the two renowned archaeologists to endorse his new yet-to-launch, live dinosaur park. As they arrive at the park situated on a private island, they are joined by a mathematician Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the 'blood- sucking' lawyer Gennaro (Martin Ferraro) representing Hammond's investors, and Hammond's two grandchildren, Lex and Tim. But then, just as a foreseeing Dr. Malcolm observes, the park goes amuck due to the betrayal of the only IT guy capable of running the park.The whole film can be enfolded by an exchange with the mathematician Dr. Malcolm first declaring: 'God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.' To which Dr. Ellie Sattler replies: 'Dinosaurs eat man. Woman inherits the earth.' First, this story portrays man's destruction of God by creating dinosaurs; man became God and created and ruled their creations as a god, but what they created was superior to them. Secondly, Spielberg involves a forced female lead whose acting falls short of the magnitude of her role. Sure, strong female leads are great, but Laura Dern portrays Sattler as almost weak and gives overdone and exaggerated expressions radically different than her fiancé's near grim looks and demeanor. Even Dr. Malcolm could not see the chemical reaction between the couple.Granted, this is considered one of the most frightening movies ever made. But deeper than the action and near escapes are the themes of paternal love. The grim Dr. Alan Grant never truly smiles, never has a genuine, good laugh over anything and above all, enormously despises children. However, chance intervenes when Mr. Hammond brings his grandchildren along to be the first visitors to the not-yet launched park. But when everything goes amuck in the park and Gennaro ditches the children in an act of cowardliness, Grant bravely but reluctantly takes them into his custody, who in turn treat him to the joys of parenthood. Some of you may have even seen it in theaters in its release and noticed that the 'theater shook.' Not surprisingly, Jurassic Park was the first major movie to use surround sound (simply sound that surrounds), bringing the petrifying sounds of the Jurassic period to the screen. With cars smothered in blood and gore, bodies eaten as fast as anchovies and intense struggle of man against his creation, no wonder Jurassic Park has such a bloodstained name on it. The language is no better; expletives drop as fast as the bodies. But cowardliness is avenged, and Dr. Grant finds his own fatherly instinct. Definitely, Jurassic Park is satisfying and the events frightening, but it falls away from the strength and complexity of the original novel.",8,1,2,3 March 2016
