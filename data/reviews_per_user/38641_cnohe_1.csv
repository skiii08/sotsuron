Marie Antoinette," Possibly worst film I have seen in 10 years
","What a disappointment! I saw it at the $2.50 movie, and that was about $3.00 too much. I had heard that the French had booed it in Cannes, and now I see why. I like an eccentric film, but this film was all over the ballpark. It seemed to lack focus and point of view. It also borrowed from Groundhog Day or Run Lola Run, but the use of the repetition technique did nothing to advance the story as it did in the other films. The use of contemporary music was a fine idea, but poorly executed - and thus the constant switch back and forth between the visuals of the period and the music of today was just peculiar - and in many ways detracted from the exceptional beauty of the costuming. The grainy photography also detracted from the film. Kirsten Dunst, whom I usually enjoy, had one facial expression for most of the movie. Rip Torn as the King was appalling. In my opinion, the movie was demeaning to all parties existing and historical, and a disappointing mess. Lost in Translation was a superb film, and I expected much more from Sofia Coppola.",1,2,5,30 December 2006
