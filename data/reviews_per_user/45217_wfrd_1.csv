Iron Man 3," One Of The Best Marvel Movies To Date
","The posters might make it seem like a really dark, grim movie. That is corrrect, but it knows when to be funny and when to be serious. Easily the best out of the iron man trilogy. The final battle is just straight up awesome! The reveal that the mandarin is just an actor makes it more funny then dark. Sorry for the spoiler, but a lot of Marvel movies don't get this epic! Overall a must see for superhero and blockbuster film fans!",9,0,0,8 July 2020
