Black Swan," the tragedy of striving for perfection
","This movie is pure art. The cinematography was delightful. The soundtrack was great, it definitely made the movie more intense. I liked the visuals too. But hands down, even though there were many good things, the best was Natalie Portman. Her moves, her faces, her voice. Her acting left me speechless. Of course, actors like Winona Ryder, Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel were unshakable too. But Natalie was the gem of this movie. She played amazing as this beautiful ballerina. The way she portrayed schizophrenia was brilliant. Again, she was stunning!",8,1,1,20 April 2019
Requiem for a Dream," SO OVERRATED
","The soundtrack is the only thing that's good. The storyline...well, there's no storyline. The whole movie is boring and senseless. I think it's trying to show how bad drugs can be and how they destroy everything you dreamed of. But I think everybody already knew that. This definitely shouldn't be one of the top rated movies.",5,5,9,4 March 2019
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," 'let's go be psychos together.'
","I truly loved the movie. I think what made it that enjoyable is how you can relate to the characters. And with time, you can even feel bad for their pain, you get attached to them. Also the film shows bullying, mental illness even sexual assault, things that every person found/collided in his teen years.
And I'm fascinated by the dialogues in the movie. They didn't seem even a little forced. Everything was just done with attention to the detail. I still get goosebumps because of the last scene. So with so many positive things I can't rate the movie with anything than an 8 (maybe I even underrated it).",8,0,0,28 March 2019
Catch Me If You Can," 'I blew it, didn't I? Why didn't I concur?'
","Great humor, great cinematography, great actors. It's an interesting story that is told in a very entertaining way. And even though it has an original plot and it's inspired by real events, the movie is still somehow not the best. It's okay, it has very good things in it but it was too long (and that's why boring at times) and even though DiCaprio is a great actor he looked too young for this specific role. I mean, it sounds pretty odd that Frank got away with all of his felonies for such a long time but it's even more unbelievable when we see Leo on the screen. In real life, the real Frank looked much older and that's why people believed he's 28. But still, great performance by DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. Not the most outstanding movie though but it's good for a watch or two.",7,0,1,23 March 2019
Passengers," predictable but still good
","The movie is nothing unusual and nothing so special but it doesn't bore you. Yes, it's a bit cheesy. And yes, it's not the best film ever made. BUT the effects are good and there's humor and a great chemistry between the main characters. It's nice because it makes you laugh and in the same time you can think about some perspectives of our lives. So it's definitely not bad but don't expect the greatest story.",7,1,1,28 February 2019
Dead Poets Society," CARPE DIEM!
","Masterpiece.The acting game was amazing, the cinematography was gorgeous and the storyline was brilliant. That's a movie everyone should watch because the message that it spreads is so important - free will, being true to yourself and following your individual path and heart. Movies like this make me wish I had a travel machine so I could turn back time and watch Dead Poets Society again so I can feel like the first time I saw it.",9,2,2,7 April 2019
Brokeback Mountain," heartbreaking
","After the movie ended, I wasn't very impressed with it. I mean, sure, it was a beautiful story about a forbidden love with a sad closing. But it's not something new and I didn't like how slow the movement was. But after a few hours, I caught myself thinking about the film again. And that's when I found out how heartbreaking the end actually was. And not just the end, the whole story about two people that want to be together but the time and the circumstances are not right is just terrible. And because of people arrogant and stupid thinking, they couldn't live their live as they wished. And god, I felt so lucky because I have the freedom to live the life that I want. But some people don't/didn't. My opinion about 'gay' love it the same before and after the movie - love is a beautiful thing and I wish everybody have a chance to experience it, it doesn't matter with whom as long as you're happy.",7,1,1,29 March 2019
Insomnia," decent drama with a little thriller
","If you saw the cast before watching the movie, you can't convince me you didn't expect something excellent. So my expectations were set high. Not only because of the famous actors but the famous director influenced on my anticipations too. But did the movie cope with these expectations? I would say 'Insomnia' is a decent drama with a little thriller but I hoped for something better. It's definitely not bad. The acting game was amazing (of course) and the storyline was original. But not always so interesting. And I can't say the movie is a mystery. Again - it's good but with this actors and director good is not enough.",6,1,1,12 April 2019
500 Days of Summer," not a love story but a story about love
","If you think about it, the main characters met in a very basic common way. Summer is just a girl that likes the same strange things Tom do so he decides she's the love of his life. And although their story is predictable in the begging, what actually is interesting in the movie is how things turned out to be. Tom was so sure they were meant for each other that he didn't notice Summer's negative treats. And because of his expectations, he countinued to suffer for her and wanted her love. I liked how real that is. Their problems and their experiences as a couple were something I think everyone can relate to in a way. And it's not an usual thing to see something so genuine in a movie therefore I definitely enjoyed the honesty.",7,0,0,11 April 2019
Zodiac," not your regular criminal drama but is that a good thing?
","When I saw there's a movie about this killer I was very surprised. I couldn't imagine how there's going to be a film about Zodiac because I knew the police still hasn't caught the killer. But I was not only surprised, I was very intrigued too. I was curious because usually movies like this have an ending where the killer is caught, like a closing where finally everything is revealed. But I knew that here this can't happen for obvious reasons that I already stated. But is the movie good even though the ending is open? Well, it started pretty successful. The murders caught my attention from the begging and then when the investigation began, I was immediately intrigued. But as the movie processed, the Zodiac killer himself faded into the background, and the film started to be a little boring. There were so many facts, so much information but in the end I knew they won't catch anybody. So with time passing, I started to lose interest and I just wanted to everything to end. I think the main problem is that this particular serial killer isn't found and that's why he's not a good material for a movie. Because we, the viewers, get a very good amount of knowledge about Zodiac's investigation but then what? We don't get our conclusion so in the end these three hours were a waste of time.",6,3,4,5 May 2019
The Prestige," what a prestige really!
","Usually when I watch something that is longer than two hours I always feel like the timing is too much even if I liked the movie. But here I didn't even feel how the hours passed! This amazing cinematography, brilliant acting and original story captured my mind for two hours straight and then left me with an open mouth at the end. I swear, this movie deserves even a higher rate. It's marvelously good. Struggle for victory, obsession of the lead characters to be the best and let's not forget, there's twist and excitement all over the place, The Prestige has everything to be a masterpiece. And it is. I'm doing you a favor by saying you should watch it! You don't wanna miss this.9.5/10",9,2,3,2 May 2019
"I, Tonya"," Margot's best role!
","The movie is good. It's real, sometimes funny and it keeps you interested most of the time.
But let's talk about the best thing in it - Margot Robbie. Real beauty who people often underestimate because they see her just as a beautiful woman. Not very talented one. But here she proved them all wrong. Her performance was amazing. Even more than that, I can honestly say her acting made the whole movie intriguing, without her this would be somehow dull and maybe even boring.",7,2,3,5 April 2019
The Book Thief," the book was brilliant, the movie was okay
","Although the movie is similar to the book as a plot, not every scene here was shown and that took away the depth of the whole story. I see that it was put a lot of effort for making this film though so respect for that. I suppose, my rate and opinion would be probably different and I would like the movie more if I hadn't read the book already. But as I know the strong connection between the characters, the love, the sadness, the misery of some of them and as I know how I got attached to them, I can't say that the movie accomplished that completely. But it's still not a bad adaptation and for anyone who doesn't want to read the book but it's keen to watch the movie, I recommend it!",6,0,0,9 April 2019
Notting Hill," 'after all... I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.'
","I would love to give this rom-com an 8 because I actually liked this kinda sweet and predictable romance. But what was missing for me? Well, I can say the humor was great, that group of William's friends was a pretty cool idea too and the acting game was on a decent level. But I wanted something more from the love story. More scenes together, more memories together, just more of them together. Because if you think about it, they only spent William's sister birthday party together and they were one night at his home. So, yeah, I needed more of their relationship but overall, the movie is pretty good and easy to watch.",7,1,1,9 April 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," extremely good!
","Definitely recommend it.
For me, it wasn't just a good movie about Freddie's life, it somehow motivated me to be different, to believe in myself and to never give up. I didn't want it to end.
But I think people forget that this is a film, not a documentary. Of course, some things are different from what happened in real life. But the movie is still enjoyable. So enjoy it!",9,1,2,9 March 2019
The Italian Job," the power of money
","Well...
I have kind of mixed feelings.
The movie can't win a prize for originality but there was kind of surprise when I learn that Steve is a betrayer and even some intense when they opened the safe in the end of the movie even though I knew that was going to happen. It's definitely not something outstanding, the acting game was average and the storyline was okay. If you don't have anything else to watch and you want something that won't weigh you down, I guess this is the movie for you.",6,0,0,3 January 2019
American Psycho," 'I have to return some videotapes'
","When I started to watch the movie I expected some thriller story about a narcissistic killer but it's so much more than that. And that's what I liked about it. It makes you think. It's about so many things which made it in some part a little confusing but overall you see a great comedy, horror and drama. And Bale is one of the greatest actors I've ever seen. He makes the scenes in the movie unique. Even if you didn't like the film, you can't deny his performance is a must see.",7,1,1,18 March 2019
American Beauty," some brilliant ideas but the rest is blah
","Everything in this movie is either very good or very bad. First, the acting game - Kevin's performance was excellent but I didn't like Bentley's and Bening's interpretations.
Second, I suppose the movie was trying to be deep and meaningful and in some scenes it really was but the rest was just plain moments full of hipocrisy.
But let's end with the best thing about the movie - the cinematography was just something else, it catched my eye from the beginning. So congratulations to that!",6,2,6,16 March 2019
The Intouchables," 'don't give up. Never give up until the fight it's over'
","Meaningful movie. Touching and funny. And it's a real story? Even better.
Somehow this film made me forget about my everyday life but in the same time, appreciate what I have. I fully recommend it.",8,1,3,14 February 2019
Jackie," the story can't keep the viewers attention for long
","When I saw the trailer of this movie, my first thought was that it probably wouldn't be interesting because the main focus is only on Jackie's point of view after her husband's death. And I think I was right. As I expected, the movie is not something captivating. There's no action, tension or drama. Natalie is great, but even her great acting can't make the movie enough interesting to keep the viewer's attention for a long time. It's also quite monotone. On the other hand, it seemed like it was put a lot of work to make the movie the best it can be. I think the mistake they made is that they only focused on her point of view about Kennedy's death. I mean, a little documentary that is about 30 minutes is enough to tell her story about her husband being murdered. But this movie is about her and they could have shown more aspects of her life and more about her work. Something that's not just connected to the White House. I see the movie much better if they included more about her as a person, an individual, maybe this way people could see her not only as the wife's president but like a talented and intelligent human being that had creative mind and showed people more than they had expected.",5,0,0,26 May 2019
Saving Private Ryan," one of the best WW2 movies
","My rate is between 7 and 8 but I decided to be 7 because of two reasons. 1 (personal) - it was too long for me, and 2 - at the end it looks like american propaganda. But the movie was good. Realistic, brutal and honest. I even felt sorry for some of the characters that were dead and I cried at the end.",7,0,1,25 February 2019
The Pianist," heartbreaking is not enough to describe this masterpiece
","The movie is quite simple, but I think that that exactly simplicity made most of the scenes so heartbreaking and overwhelming. There was no filter, just raw and real truth of what jewish people had to go through during WW2. The movie showed desperation, hope, need for survival. Some moments were so heavy that I was not even able to cry, I just simply suffered wathing the main character's misery. Another thing I noticed, and liked, in the film is that some Nazis (specially Captain Hosenfeld) were presented in a positive way that I have not seen in any movie about the WW2 before, it just proves that some of them contained humanity. Also, needless to say but I will say it anyway, the acting game was at a spectacular level. Overall, I think this was a very powerful and distressing documentary not only about one pianist's survival but a story about a whole dark and disturbing era of the human history. Like I said, very heartbreaking movie but definitely a worth watching one.",8,1,1,26 May 2019
Mr. Nobody," good movie but not for everyone
","Everything we do change our lives in one way or another but there is not a right change. There's not a right choice. Every opportunity that we take or don't take has it's own consequences. Whatever we choose, there always will be pain and suffer in our lives. And that's okay.
That's what this movie means to me and I think the message is great.
But it's not a film for everyone because it's long and you have to pay attention and I personally was kind of confused by the end.",6,1,2,10 February 2019
Schindler's List," 'whoever saves one life, saves the world entire'
","Almost a nine but it was too long for me and I found some flaws. It's a bit overrated in my opinion but in the same time I really loved it. I was thinking about the movie days after I watched it. So it definitely catched my attention and it will be remembered as one of the best films I've ever seen although I expected a little more for such a classic. But still, I recommend it to all of my friends and I'll watch it a second time
probably.",8,0,4,27 February 2019
Prisoners," 'pray for the best, but prepare for the worst.'
","Although many people have already said this,I still want to mention how amazing the acting game was and how beautiful some scenes were shot. But I will focus mainly on the storyline. Indeed, the plot is worth of admiration. As the movie passes, there are a lot of plot twists and moments filled with tension. But even though there were a lot of unexpected turns, some scenes were pretty monotone, and the movie atmosphere is really exhausting and dark. A lot was happening and in some moments I felt like there was too much things going on. Reading the reviews here, I found some plot holes too but again, I think that was because there were too many things going on on screen and some characters actions got confused. However, I do not deny the movie was made with a good thought (I also really liked the end), but I would change one or two things. Even with the little flaws, I recommend to watch.",8,0,0,24 May 2019
Life Is Beautiful," will 100% remember this
","The first 30 minutes were strange and I didn't like them but then the storyline captured my eyes.
The movie definitely made me think about the way I see some things in the world. And although the metaphorical performance was not my cup of tea, I liked the movie so much that I even cried in the end.",8,1,2,18 February 2019
The Shape of Water," I understand only the award for motion picture, the movie doesn't deserve the rest
","The movie is really lovely to look at, amazing aesthetics! I also enjoyed most of the love story. It was unique and interesting to watch. Actually, it was the most interesting thing to watch in the whole film. Some
other scenes were a little monotone. But the end was so disappointing. I can't explain why, the story just felt a little silly when everything ended just fine. Maybe it didn't really touch me because I'm fan of more tragic scenarios and this closing was a bit cheesy and too sweet for me. So the movie does a great job if we talk about beautiful scenes but I can't say the plot is good enough.",6,2,3,6 April 2019
Psycho," 'we all go a little mad sometimes'
","One of the few movies that deserve to be a classic.
The acting game was on such a good level and there was intense during the whole movie.
Maybe I should watch it a second time cause I want to see the things that Norman says in another perspective after I know that he killed his mother.
Oh, and let's not forget about the last scene! Such a masterpiece!
Definitely not a horror though but a true thriller!",7,2,2,1 January 2019
Whiplash," what a tension!
","All the way through the whole movie I felt so intense, my stomach was in knots. But the tension is one of the many great things this movie can offer. It's original and the performances are so good that they make the atmosphere kind of painful to watch but in the same time everything is just somehow inspirational. That's what surprised me the most. You see the tears, you see the blood. You see that madness for success. And you tell yourself 'That's crazy. He's sick.' but in the same time it motivates you to be better in the things you do, to follow your dreams even if it's hard. But then, maybe I will sound hypocritical, we have only one life and sometimes a person has to think about his priorities in life. I mean, do you really want to suffer and be humiliated for the award to be great? If you are ready to do that then that's okay. But if you don't want that that's okay too. That's what I get from the movie. I feel like Whiplash showed what it takes to be the best - how you have to sacrifice everything and be completely dedicated to your task, but in the same time it showed the ugly side too - how because of success you can't really enjoy anything else, how you limit yourself from so many great things. So with so much truth and amazing acting, I can't say anything else than that this movie deserves to be watched.",8,0,0,6 May 2019
The Green Mile," magically good
","I always say fantasy is not my favorite type of genre but this movie is an exception. I loved it. The best thing was the acting game. Every character was made for the actor. Duncan's performance made me so amazed in the beginning and so sad at the end. It's not something common for me to cry this much on a movie. And putting aside the acting game, the storyline was told very captivating and even though the whole thing is three hours long, I wasn't bored of it. I will remember this film as a magical sad but amazing experience.",8,0,0,31 March 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," 'hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.'
","Shawshank Redemption is a simple but amazing film with an everlasting message.
Although there's no action or special effects, this movie keeps you interested from the beginning to the end. You have friendships, difficulties, dreams and most importantly: you have hopes. All that Shawshank Redemption is about is ETERNAL HOPE! And I think this theme is what makes this movie so special. Not only you find something relatable (even though the circumstances that the characters are in probably have nothing to do with you), but you think about the message, about the movie. And after you watch it you feel motivated, even grateful for what you have. You feel hope. And that's exactly how you should feel because as the movie says 'Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.'",8,0,0,2 May 2019
Amélie," beautifully shot but so slow
","The first and the last minutes of the movie were the most interesting moments for me. The first because we met Amelie and we took a look at the amazing cinematography. The last because she's FINALLY with this man she likes. But other than this - the characters were so boring and even Amelie was annoying sometimes, the movie lacks tension and it's unnecessarily long. I mean, it's not bad film but I don't get what is all the fuss about.",6,0,2,12 March 2019
50_50," well... the movie really is 50/50
","I don't know if it's because there're too much movies about cancer and that why it's hard to make an interesting and distinguish plot about this topic but this movie lacks originality to the point that becomes boring after you watch the first 30 minutes. Thank God, the actors are good and they bring some sparkling in the movie but that's it. Nothing special, nothing that deserves to be remembered.",5,3,5,24 March 2019
Easy A," definitely not the best rom-com
","The best thing in these kind of movies is that you can relate to the characters and their experiences. And yes, in most rom-coms the storyline is pretty cheesy but oh my god, here some scenes were not just cheesy but even ridiculous. Some characters were very unbelievable too. I mean, was the director even in school when he was a teenager? Because I didn't see ONE single thing from what was happening to the main character that I see in my everyday life. BUT if we forget about the unrealistic school routine, Emma was amazing in her role and her parents were adorable (they were probably the best thing in the movie). Also there were some funny scenes so if you're in a mood for a comedy, I suppose you can watch this.",5,2,2,21 April 2019
