Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made
","A visual spectacle, an emotional rollercoaster, and a good old-fashioned story of good vs. evil in a fairy tale setting.  Ladies and gentleman, Star Wars.For two hours, we leave this sad, sorry world behind.  We are taken to a place where the good guys always win and there is no 'gray area.'  We can truly suspend our disbelief and enjoy this film.  And all the complaints about Jar Jar, PLEASE!  Jar Jar is one of the most important characters in the film.  He embodies the people in our society who may not be gifted mentally, but have a good heart and are willing to help.  If you slam Jar Jar, then that should tell you something about yourself as a person.  The Star Wars Saga has always been one of my favourites, and this film is the best of the series.  It brings together the revolutionary vision of the original with the action and excitement that modern-day moviegoers crave. If you like genuinely good movies (and are looking for a decent movie to look at with your kids outside of the realm of Disney) check this one out.",10,24,36,15 January 2001
The Fifth Element," Could Have Been Much, Much, Better
","The Fifth Element was...okay.  It had a good storyline and a strong heroine character, but it was too out of touch with reality.  A good sci-fi film makes you wonder could this ever really happen?  The Fifth Element did not do that.  For one, all of the bright colors and ridiculous outfits were completely unbelievable, and I mean that negatively.  The storyline, although it's been done a hundred times, suffered from the cartoony set design.  How could I believe the world was coming to an end when everything looks like it came out of a Saturday morning kids program?  A dark, brooding set design would have been better.  The film does have one saving grace-Mila Jovovich.  Her character is interesting and fun because of her conflict; she was built as a weapon but was like a child.  Other than that, all of the other performances, especially Bruce Willis's flat Rambo wannabe, were uninspired and the set design crippled the film so badly it wasn't even worth watching.",3,3,5,14 January 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'There is no fate but what we make.'
","Pay attention to this movie.  It will teach you many lessons.  First, it is a well made film.  The lighting, camera work, and well-choreographed action scenes are all a lesson in movie making.  And the acting is great too, especially Linda Hamilton's immortal performance.  But most profound of this movie is its meaning.  Are we really in control of what we make?  Are the machines really our slaves, or are they our masters?  It's a lot of meaning hidden behind a lot of action.  Forget Titanic.  This is James Cameron's finest work ever.",10,1,1,15 January 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," An Awesome Epic Masterpiece
","**WARNING** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSI've just returned from the theater and I must say I already want to see this movie again.  Despite the inconclusive ending, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a very satisfying film.  While kung-fu fans will get the biggest kick (no pun intended) out of it, those who enjoy romance and drama will to. In fact, it's more of a romantic-drama than anything.  The fight scenes are breathtaking if not a bit unrealistic.  While The Matrix (the closest thing to kung-fu film that mainstream America has yet to see) offers an explanation for the characters being able to perform feats of superhuman speed and agility, CTHD does not.  But don't worry.  With a little bit of suspended disbelief and a quick eye (those subtitles sure go by fast) you will find this movie as good as any Oscar contender.",9,0,0,11 February 2001
Titanic," Horrible
","Pardon my bluntness, but this movie sucks.  It's nothing more than a cheesy love story that we've all seen a hundred times.  Nice girl, bad boy, evil fiancee, blah-blah-blah. Oh yeah, the ship sinks at the end. What this movie should have focused on, the tragedy of what happened that night, is missed.  We get a three hour love story and a one hour SFX overload.  Yeah, greatest movie of all time alright.",1,4,11,14 January 2001
The Matrix," The Greatest Movie Ever
","The Matrix is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest movie ever.  Many movies come close (Star Wars, T2, Gladiator) but none match the raw power and impact of The Matrix's story and characters. What makes The Matrix so great is not just its originality or the fact that it merges so many genres of sub-culture into one nice little package, but its scope and meaning.  This movie tells us so many things-to know what we create is capable of, to not let technology become our master and not our slave, to take what we accept as the truth with a grain of salt.  It forces us to re-access the world around us, to ask questions instead of settle for answers.  How many other movies do that? If you are looking for an interesting diversion that will help you waste a few hours of your time, see The Fifth Element or Titanic,other fantsy/adventure and sci-fi films that have a lot of wrapping but no package underneath.  If you want a film that will make you think, make you question the world around you, make you look at the definition of reality in a whole new way, see The Matrix.",10,0,1,14 January 2001
