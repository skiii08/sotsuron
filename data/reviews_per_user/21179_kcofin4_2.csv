The Legend of Bagger Vance," place in the field
","the movie a couple of times has the caddy Will Smith suggest to golfer Matt Damon trying to regain his swing that he needs to find his 'place in the field' which would normally mean your accurate place as a ranking in a 'field of golfers' / your natural ranking or place... which you maintain with your own natural swing ...but it also means ... your place in the universe as the caddy teaches the golfer (in regaining his swing) you always have 'your' swing and its an accurate & great swing WHEN you are connected to all things , the universe, etc and that (all things/the universe) is the larger 'field' and you are connected when you 'find' 'your place (& swing) in the field'",10,0,1,24 September 2006
Closer," transport vs mania
","in viewing many of the other reviews it seems so many were manic in commentingi still go , relax and allow myself to be transported to the movies location and characters to enter in them and import the themes and dialoguei am NOT sitting blabbering endlessly to myself THEN on viewing OR later....i found (blabbering now on reflection only) Julia sad faced and too flatnatalie truly such a wonderful mixture of kid and adult woman and that beautiful face and figure ... and with many shades... in life many older as me have BEEN through such intrigues of about every kind and these are not made up or so unusual as to be rubbish... all in all excellent entertainment and as intended, provoking us to consider the consequences of ?? truth vs lying to 'loved ones' willy",10,0,1,22 February 2005
