The Expendables 2," Bottom line, cheesy , cheap and disappointing (Makes Derailed look better as a Van Damme movie...)
","No plot, terrible CGI . It made Willis look like a bitch, it brought back Arnold only to saturate him in cheesy one liners that you could see from a mile away. I literally felt like I had watched this movie before while sitting there. I predicted the outcome of every scene that unfolded. I was only surprised once. It had no suspense for me because it was so predictable. The old airplane needs to pull up or it will crash type of thing over and over again. It doesn't take a genius to know they are going to clear the building in the airplane...No suspense, boring...This movie lacks any true originality and it offers few surprises.The solo careers of these actors have infinitely better films, plots, out of Bollywood. Hollywood is getting really cheap, redundant and unoriginal. This movie felt unexciting , uninspired.The cast and crew didn't really shine, they didn't have any really radiant moments on screen, though a terrific cast they had their on screen charisma , and charm it was mostly wasted to a terrible script that had no plot, non stop action with little substance , suspense.This movie offers no real thinking, surprises. It's rather sort of dull and there's nothing really remember able about it.Especially the performance of Van Damme, who is a life time martial artist professional who gets so screwed at the end of the movie. He gets a death that is so weak and pathetic where he is basically treated like a submissive weak cast member and succumbs to death willingly . Stallone's ego is clearly in your face this movie and this old Van Damme , Stallone fall out is penned out. We're pretending FFS , whatever goes on between them shouldn't be on screen. It was like he succumbed to Stallone and was dominated and violated . It was terrible.Just because it's Hollywood that doesn't make it good. The writing was atrocious and the characters were SILLY, they made chuck Norris look like a live action hero clown...I kid with you not when he showed up the good ,the bad and the ugly played for some bizarre reason . I was expecting him to have a clown nose or walk on water...I could feel people around me cringing, but the blissful just laughed...the entire movie ...especially when people died...violently which can be entertaining but these people were gasping for air the entire movie. And that made me die a little inside...They had horrible writing, cheesiness throughout, the CGI was so cheap...If you want to see good films with these actors look to their independent careers, even see Bollywood. This was not a very good movie.People argue it's the 80s, it's not the 80s anymore and this is a satire on films. Silly stupid fun action adventure movies in reality date back to the 60s if not sooner. This movie is just on another level of stupid and mindless , even than the 80s. And it has these horrific jokes that will give me nightmares where they reference real life and other films in the middle of major action sequences...Get on with old and goofy , we all like your films, PLEASE act in this one, don't talk about the good old days of your life, career in the real world . Did you forget your medication, you're filming a damn movie! I don't even know what to make of that, but it was done so poorly.It was Van Damme's big return and they couldn't even put their egos aside to give him a decent fight scene. 3 Round house kicks in a row and then basically down hill from there, couldn't spread it out, make it more dramatic? FFS we're all pretending here, give us our money's worth. It was a horrible Van Damme movie... it makes Derailed look like a better movie ...I was so disappointed.",1,7,15,20 August 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," To boldly go where every man woman and child has been before several times
","Star Trek has been a long continuation of new stories, new adventures, fascinating pseudo science. It was the space less traveled. It was a brilliant science fiction in the 60s ahead of its time and The Next Generation is still a classic science fiction today. Voyager too had a good run with original Trek material.Enterprise wasn't that bold, didn't really go where we haven't been before. It was sort of generic, bland.Now what we have is a TOU the original universe verses JJ's universe. Which is really just a parallel universe... not really bold. The boldest thing here is that he took a famous classic film and then just mirrored it in his 'parallel' universe . Not really that much vision here... at least this one doesn't have so many lens flares? We have essentially the wrath of Khan in a parallel universe. What's next? The Voyage Home in a parallel universe? The spirit of star trek is dead. There is no boldly going anywhere. It's JJ boldly going into an old franchise and taking everything as his own 'vision'. That's as bold as we get here... nothing really original about this movie. It just takes a famous franchise and milks off of it. It just takes what fans originally loved and gives it a make over . Not really trekking any place new or exciting. Star Trek is just a thing now, it's not a living entity, it's a cash cow without any heart. 'What can we do that will draw in lots of people, I know let's make a alternate reality of the Wrath of Khan, next we can do The Undiscovered Country!' It's just giving the past a face lift... there is no future here for Star Trek. Give it a few bright flashy movies without any real substance and then Star Trek will be left out in deep cold space again... buried alive.It literally has many of the same story lines and dialogs as does The Wrath of Khan. This movie should have been called The Wrath of JJ Abrams, Trek Backwards.It doesn't boldly go anywhere, it's a face paced action adventure film without any real star trekking involved. When are we going to get something, new , unique, from Star Trek again? When are we going to stop trekking backwards? The character development wasn't even a focus in this film because it was non stop action and you had no time to focus on any of the characters really...There are better science fictions that come out that are original series, films anymore. If Star Trek can't give us anything new, original then it's basically dead to me. This is more like a homage to a classic film that just happened to be screened in theaters all around the world. A very talented director no doubt, talented actors... but this movie lacks the true spirit of Star Trek and any real mystery involved.It is cringe worthy that a movie can do this well when it was already mostly written and no real insight was involved and any one who saw the original could predict 90 percent of this film and its outcome...They are laughing all the way to the bank on this one...The twists it had varying from alternate universes weren't even truly significant.It's just another movie, another movie adaptation of Star Trek. If this is all that is left for Star Trek then it might as well be dead... There is no real life breathed into the franchise. We don't need to see the same movie in a parallel universe...There's a lot of Trek fans holding onto something that isn't free to grow, expand the universe. The universe isn't expanding it's contracting... if there is another movie I pray to God that it will at least by that time won't use dialog from the original films. Maybe by the time of the 3rd movie Kirk will wear William shatner's wig on his head and will get plump for the role and they will just green screen parts of the original films into the new film.There's no real dimension here, the series isn't moving forwards, it isn't going anywhere... It's going in reverse until it halts and engines burn out again.This film, this sort of Star Trek is not a long term Star Trek, it's a fast paced action film without any real intelligent thought, imagination, creativity put into it. It's not a long term solution to the struggles the franchise was facing... there will be a few more movies then Star Trek will need another reboot or it will just die out. Or maybe a true continuation of Star Trek and what it's really about is what will occur. These movies don't do STTNG or even Voyager any real justice.The true original content JJ has added is lens flare, flashy effects, action scenes. A mixed up confusing plot, full of holes... what he has added, and his unique imprint, touch on this series and this film is not very Star Trek like and isn't very original. It's just another action adventure film and it's more Star Wars than it is Star Trek. The movie fails to have any real philosophical/ moral dilemmas and it feels more like Star Wars than it does Star Trek with its over the top action scenes.They had Prime Spock in the movie last minute just to tell the audience how bad of a guy Khan really was. Most of his character development happened off screen and referred to the Wrath of Khan.",5,49,94,13 May 2013
Oldboy," Severely over rated without any true blindly strong points to place it so high, average film on most accounts
","I don't get why you guys think this is such a great film. It's not inspiring, the plot centers on incest.. I don't get what's so great about this movie. As a revenge film it's not that original, no one sane wants to do their daughter. And the plot wasn't that original, it was just disturbing. Becoming a super hero being locked up in a room for 15 years? It quickly became a quirky action film, about this guy who became bruce lee while being locked up for years. Not that deep or profound a silly film.I don't get the fascination with a foreign film just because it's foreign, but this wasn't that deep, cerebral, it was almost Primal how it played out, violence, mixed with sexual perversions. Nothing that deep. The world itself is already devastated with sexual perversion, violence. This film wasn't that shining, it wasn't a masterpiece. Some parts were literally a soft porn, given the context . This movie would likely get a 6 out of 10, why it has a 8 is beyond me. It's not a masterpiece . I don't see what makes this as good as star wars, or the S -Redemption....This movie is over rated , critically...It's not creative, artistic. The cinematography is more or less average. This movie has nothing really amazing about it. It doesn't have a lot of vision. It's mediocre like most Hollywood films are. We didn't see anything that amazing, and weren't blown away. We thought it was fair, but not a masterpiece.",5,5,11,6 May 2012
Léon: The Professional," I just saw this recentally but it was a very beautiful movie
","There has never been anything else like this in my opinion. This is easily one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. I'm not really sure why but it's a very touching film. I was really blown away haha. This isn't much of a review. Leon is a very human character, he's got a lot of depth to him. The entire cast is brilliant, the story is brilliant. It's honestly one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. I know these reviews are silly but I just love this movie. Portman is at her best here.This movie has the most realistic performances I've seen in some time. This movie is a masterpiece to me, I felt like it was a true story when it had finished. It felt so real. I actually thought about the characters and worried for them or connected to them on a very real level. This movie was deep, take my word for it haha. I don't have all the words right now but this film is a work of art.It felt very real to me, and it touched me on a deep level that I don't quite understand. After watching this I hugged my mother good night haha and went upstairs to write this review. This movie is truly one of a kind. This film is a work of art. I can't place my finger on all the reasons but it will linger on as a beautiful tapestry in my subconscious mind for some time, inspiring me and giving me a new perspective on film. I was touched by this movie. There's some kind of genius involved with this movie. This movie is some how profound. It's one of my favorite movies now. I would watch it again and I think it would only be better a second viewing. I've given up on modern film. This is a true gem, classic that I hadn't seen before. Now that I've seen it, it's easily one of my favorite films.It has more than what you see upfront, but it's not pretentious about it. It's deep without trying too hard to be deep. I was very absorbed , the movie felt to be the perfect length, had a great cast, perfect dialog, I loved everything about this movie.There it is, I loved this movie. There's not much to say , I made a deeper connection with it, I'm not entire sure how, why but I fell in love with this movie. It's one of my favorites now.",10,1,1,18 June 2013
Man of Steel," Does not add anything, does not out do it's predecessors , over the top action
","The story line was basically the same. It felt like a mixture of Superman 2, 1, and maybe Superman 4. There was an overwhelming amount of action, which doesn't add anything to a movie for me, or entertain me. The action was over the top, and really hard to follow. It's basically like pew pew pew boom! WHEEEE RAGHHH pew pew pew type action. I like movies where the action is sort of manageable on screen. I don't like action movies where the action is over the top and the characters are invincible. I know it's a Super hero movie and I have seen Superman films in the past. As a matter of fact I've seen them all.. I felt that movies like The Avengers or Captain America,Iron Man 1, 2 -3 the action was at least sort of grounded. The overdose of action didn't really add anything for me at all, I felt like it was a video game or a cartoon. Granted a cartoon sort of fits this franchise, the over action didn't add anything to me for this film version. It was just a mess, there was one scene that I felt was really kind of brain less. They're in a street between buildings and they are bringing down large craft in the streets and blowing things up and miraculously the only damage that occurs is inside the narrow street between the buildings. I just felt like they had a large explosion or CGI effects where ever they could possibly cram them into the story and went over board where ever they go. It's like everyone that goes to a movie now a days is assumed to have ADD or I feel like I'm Crank and they are trying to keep my heart racing and keep me hopped up on the action, suspense. Only there was no suspense for me just a pew pew pew over load of action without any real drama in it for me. I couldn't even get into the action over load. The maximum amount of damage and explosions and I don't actually remember any real suspense expect for one tiny part at the end of the movie where superman saved some one from being burnt alive by laser heat vision eyes. When his father dies, is horrifically predictable and also sort of poorly written. He doesn't die because he's a hero really, he dies because he goes back to save a dog,a dog... then they add in the bit that he died to keep Superman's identity secret, well sort of...There's nothing added in this movie, nothing new. Small Ville already showed us a bullied Clark that had to hold back his anger etc etc. The villains are though very well cast were basically the same as the super man 2 villains. The ice fortress or whatever you want to call it was basically the same... To be this is as original a movie to Superman as the new Star Trek is to Star Trek. It's basically some kind of reboot that doesn't really look past the original films in my opinion. Though I admit the female evil super woman was rather attractive by my tastes. She was attractive in Superman 2 too if I remember...basically the same character and basically the same back ground for those 3 villains in this movie and that one... They even basically look the sameAh, it is in fact the same characters with a little refresher of the memory...I was looking for a more realistic adaptation of the character on film and this definitely wasn't it. It had a strong cast of actors, actresses. The movie had barely enough story, but there really wasn't that much character development and the characters were the same characters that had been played for the past 70 something years. The characters were basically written just to fit the part... Lois was basically just Lois. Clark was basically just Clark...The villains might as well been Lex Luther again. It's the same old story... but I felt this movie was just way too over the top. It had a great cast of supporting actors who were probably used better than the main supporting cast. The supporting characters were more interesting in my opinion than the characters written just to fit into a 'Superman script'.I understand that the movie is supposed to be on a super sized scale and supposed to be over the top. The action however seems to be the main focus of the film and just keeps getting piled on thicker and thicker. I got burnt out. It was kind of like POTCS 3 to me where there was action and more action and more action and I just got burnt out eventually.I would say that this was just an action film really. It goes into the character a little bit but over all it's fast, loud and for a younger audience that likes pew pew boom pew pew action type stuff.It just didn't have a lot of substance for me to call this a masterpiece. I know we shouldn't have been expecting Citizen Kane... but over all it's just a Superman movie. I don't feel that it at all has out done it's predecessors. I don't feel like it's added anything either and I personally don't go in for over the top action films. It's about on level with the new Star Trek film for me...",5,1,4,15 June 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Well my family thought it was on par with the original trilogy I didn't
","The over the top complex action scenes were a little too Goofy for me. I am calling them Goofy because they reminded me of a Goofy cartoon where the action is so ridiculous and out there that it's almost laughable. The tone of the first few films had a more 'real' feel for me. The action was more suspenseful and 'epic'. The action in this movie is like a mixture of mission impossible and the matrix. Maybe not as crazy as the matrix but I'm trying to get my point across.One scene Bilbo falls like 100 feet grabs a rope and falls again and is miraculously unharmed. Characters go from being immortal to mortal it seems, it's like a cartoon that's what action adventure films have become. Turn off your brains because in action adventure films the hero can now jump 100 feet to the ground and run away on the soles of his feet. I'm not really into how the action/ adventure genre is going.There is a scene under ground where they are crossing bridges and like a cartoon they jump from bridge to bridge and all these implausible scenes. It was just too over the top for me and it wasn't as epic for me and didn't have as clever of dialog , or as deep of scenes.Speaking of which, I was only emotionally moved once in the film and LOTR I find to be a masterpiece that is emotionally moving and complex throughout.This film is not complex, the characters succumb to fart humor and ball sack humor and the dialog is no where near the dialog of the first trilogy. More of the same, giant spiders, Baggins, butter flies turning into Birds . Slow motion fight scenes... When it was different it was just a generic action / adventure film full of tedious and ridiculous action scenes. I feel that the original 3 films had mostly plausible action scenes, with mostly mortal characters. This film I really have to suspend my disbelief as birds toss characters around 100s of feet apart playing catch. A scene that I don't understand, it seems that anything they did in this film that could be senselessly over done to make it more exciting was senselessly over done...The birds show up to carry them away but for some reason play catch with one another...The first films had a beautiful score and was filmed beautifully. The cinematography was fantastic. This film looks polished, and pretty but it really lacks the soul the first 3 had. I was never taken back by this movie . Watching this film I had no serene moments where I had to stop and think how beautiful it was or how epic it was. I think that is because this film doesn't really take moments for reflection and to make you think . There are no real scenic moments where you have time to take it all in. The magic just isn't there for me when there is focus on the characters there's not a lot of substance. Pile on top of that the characters are completely predictable as stated in this review some of them are very obvious.The 'cool ' character almost dies, but is miraculously better later with no real signs of injury. He tells Bilbo that he doesn't belong in their fellowship and then predictably later says he was wrong...The characters are mostly 1 dimensional and typical characters you would find in various fantasy stories. Bilbo is a little more interesting to follow but his scenes don't really add that much to the story as a whole when looking at the entire franchise as a whole.It doesn't feel as 'triumphant ' as the original 3, I wasn't as emotionally moved or inspired by this film as I was the first trilogy.But, some of the characters are relate-able, which is a good thing obviously.Of course the locations made beautiful by the original 3 films reappear in this one to be beautiful again. I'm not really absorbed or excited about the 'new story'. I'm not into it at all, what so ever. I'm not even fully sure what it's all about or why I should really care. It seems to just be filler for the original story.'Let's make it because we can...' The original story is a short story and I feel that the movie is almost pointless and what they've come up with as a movie doesn't seem truly appropriate or necessary to the franchise. It's entertaining enough so I give it a 7, I could never give this film a 10...There is not a lot of suspense when you think about the major character because we all know that he's alive later on. As for the other characters they were never in any true harm and I never expected that they'd die. And the entire film goes on where the entire cast is left alive and well. One character gets injured but being the 'cool' one we know he's not going to die , as he's the leader of their group more or less any ways he's a needed character.The old actors are a bit tried reprising their roles and a bit too obvious in many instances. What could be an opportunity to learn more about characters is wasted in over stating the obviousness of how their characters will turn out. Saruman plays a obviously evil character and Gandalf plays some one who is clueless.Corniness and predictability pursues. Clichés...",6,5,17,21 December 2012
Iron Man," Good, but didn't age well
","Going back to this movie, it's good but has some serious flaws. The ending was the worse bit, where he was fighting the bad guy in a very technologically advanced killing machine, was about 2- 3 feet away firing machine guns, and rockets and couldn't hit Stark... who was hanging from a support beam. The movie although a comic book movie has a few scenes that are really shy of bright.There was a scene where Stark goes flying like a rocket and lands on his back , destroying his entire suit but isn't harmed. I know it's a movie, but some of the levels of stupidity in this movie have nothing to do with being a movie... it's just bad writing. How can I believe that the villain can't hit a target 2 feet away, even if it were damaged how hard is it to shoot a rocket at a target manually or hit something with a high power machine gun? There were other flaws. Though no super hero movie is perfect that was pretty bad, the ending fight scene of this movie was like something out of Batman and Robin it was so laughably bad.It's mostly a good movie but it's got some weak spots and I give it a 6 out of 10 upon revisiting it.",6,1,4,11 May 2014
Godzilla," A good movie , probably a 7 as a movie, but where is Godzilla?
","Well in my opinion this movie is being over rated, a 10? It wasn't terrible, but come on a 10? The subliminal messages for September 11th and other disasters puts it lower than that off the bat. I didn't know what to expect going into Godzilla. I was trying to be open minded. The roar from the trailer was the first thing I worried about, because it just doesn't sound quite right. That's a little detail, icing on the cake. Important but not the core of the movie's problems. The core of the movie's problem is that as a Godzilla film... it doesn't really have Godzilla. I didn't really expect that . Godzilla has about 20 -30 seconds in this 3 hour movie... literally. If you do a slow count, I think that is about right.Count as slow as you want, it's a 3 hour movie. The movie itself isn't so bad, but because of the lack of Godzilla I give it a 7, as a movie that doesn't really have Godzilla... I didn't care for the other monsters either, it's just a weird plot , the two other monsters are male and female and getting jiggy with it... and do a head rub.... It was just weird, didn't work naturally for me. I would preferred if they had mothara and Gamera or something. But no they had two Cloverfield type monsters and showed them far more than they did Godzilla. Godzilla was barely in this movie.The movie also focuses way too much on the military, most the film is the military defeating the monsters and fighting the monsters, trying to defeat the monsters and not Godzilla... at the end when Godzilla apparently gets tried of fighting he just grabs the monsters by the throat shoots his atomic breathe down their throat and rips their head off... The other one I think he just beats to death with a building and it's dead... that's pretty damn lame. Tag on that seeing the military more than we see Godzilla and September 11th subliminal messages... and you got a winner.What some people don't realize yet is that by watching a movie they are basically watching the news, whether it's about war, being a patriot or a politician's lying feel good speech or September 11th... it's all the same BS and now the subliminal messages are becoming appalling obvious in film. Godzilla actually has no problem killing these monsters... there's no real fighting... The Japanese won't be taking any notes and we should have been taking many when writing the fight scenes for this turkey of a script. ( Not a terrible movie again, a 7 is being fair...) It's still too American, not Japanese enough. Stay away from Ultraman, USA please. ( I am American.) Also there is no Godzilla music, and the music they have is a cheesy hero theme that made me feel like they were making Godzilla like the Dark Knight.It really feels like this movie was just to set things up for an possible American sequel film. Godzilla is barely in this movie.It's not a terrible film, it's not as bad as the 1998 film, but it's still a miss from Japanese culture film and as Americans we really screwed up the fight scenes... The Japanese know how to make monster fight scenes like the Americans know how to make Rocky fight scenes.We didn't do it justice, but it's not a horrible film. I rather watch Godzilla 2000, which was in American theaters when released. I give this movie a 7.",7,1,4,16 May 2014
The Ugly Truth," How did people get so stupid
","This is the most a-moral, bull movie some one could watch. All men want is a physical relationship and they are dimwitted arrogant over grown children, and that's what men are.The Ugly truth is the war raging on against you all and the way they want you to think. It lacks any true wit, it is a deluded crude spoof on reality. It's more of the sort of junk that the military industrial complex wants out there. Take away your beliefs, morals and intelligence. Dumb you down and take away your ethics.It's a trash film and the fact that my family sits through it without even knowing why they are watching it disturbs me. The most shallow, brainless entertainment full of crude comical interpretations of both sexes that aren't even funny. Brain wash garbage.",1,10,18,27 December 2012
