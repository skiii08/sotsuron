Blade Runner 2049," a very rare MASTERPIECE! (smart, thoughtful, artistic)
","just finished watching this movie,. and it's now already becoming one of my top most favorite movie! it's extremely VERY RARE to see this type of movie (genre)...which I always wish people could appreciate it more... but in reality, again...this is not the type of movie for everyone, obviously... (not the typical 'mainstream / hype' trending / action-superhero blockbusters type of movie)! futuristic, sci-fi, dystopian, deep, smart/thoughtful, philosophical, speculative, artistic, imaginative,...with many deeper meaningful layers & metaphors/symbolism...with a very unique & peculiar 'irony' & 'emptiness' feels & tones! heavily reminds me of 'The Matrix' trilogy, the recent 'Ghost In The Shell' earlier this year, which -again- have always been my favorite movie genre! will definitely watch it again for the second time (or perhaps even more)...because, for me personally,.it's really WORTH IT,.!",10,5,11,10 October 2017
