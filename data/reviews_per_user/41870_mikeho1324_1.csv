The Ring," The Japanese version-- no good! The American version-- don't know
","I've seen 3 of the Japanese version of this movie 'Ring', which aren't good at all. I fell in sleep in each of this three time. Totally not scary. The scene that considered a bit scarier than 'today world' in this movie is that when the ghost crawls out of the television screen [don't know if the US version includes that scene as well]. Hopefully, the US version will be more scary, and it should be better than the Japanese one, since you don't have to catch the subtitle all the time and miss all the scary parts should there be any. But come to think, Japan is leading the trend of entertainment around the world in the past decade: Playstation 1 & 2, Nintendo, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, etc. Now they are 'invading' the traditional US dominated movie market. Thus I predict that this movie will gain a big load in the box office. But not all people will like it, since sushi isn't tasty for everyone.",Null,0,0,11 October 2002
