Antz," Top class intelligent entertainment
","I loved this story. I thought is was a very intelligently entertaining movie:- a good combination of interesting ideas mixed with great visuals and broad comedy.All the the voice casting was top notch; especially Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Sylvester Stallone, Dan Aykroyd, and of course Woody Allen. There was also great version of Neil Finn singing 'I Can See Clearly Now'; and the visual design and music score was breath-taking and dynamic. Plus the storyline is more gritty with a darker undercurrent, and would appeal to a more sophisticated audience, which it is good to have. I'm not saying that cute fun stories aren't OK too. In fact IMHO the wider the spectrum of stories we can get the better we'll all be.I personally think this is slightly ahead of the equally brilliant A BUG'S LIFE; even though both are really top class storytelling. This one wins by about half a feeler.",10,27,37,30 August 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why HJO would have been wrong as Annakin
","When you really think about it, the Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy is the galactic bouncer of the Empire. He's 'the big guy we'll send around to break ya fingers if ya don't pay up' - well, metaphorically at any rate. It's actually Grand Moff Tarkin (in Ep IV) and the Emperor (in Eps V & VI) that are really the political masterminds that are calling the shots. They're the strategists, the big bosses, while Darth Vader is the cat's paw/the patsy/the muscle.On top of that, the interpretation of the Eps I, II & III (at least what I'm guessing) is that Annakin/Darth Vader is very impetuous, impatient and quick-tempered. He's the sort of person who wants everything done his way, in obvious black & white choices; and he's going to ram through like the proverbial bull in a china shop in order to get results. It's this personality that makes the Dark Side so tempting. As Yoda says (as far as I can remember); the Dark Side 'isn't more powerful; just quicker, easier.'I recall Haley Joel Osment's father complaining in an interview that they auditioned the kids for Annakin by getting them to play with toys. I can understand what the casting agents were doing; they were checking the child's inherent personality and problem-solving techniques. Were they more impulsive, aggressive, impatient? Or were they inherently analytical, calculating, shrewd?It seems to me that Haley is an inherently intellectual, very politically astute, and analytical type of person. He would have actually made a perfect child version of Palpatine or Moff Tarkin. Whereas Jake Lloyd on the other hand is a lot more impulsive, aggressive, and fairly choleric in his personality. Even he admitted in interviews that he's inherently a tough person to deal with. Which actually demonstrates that he was the perfect casting as a young Annakin; who was going to turn into a brooding and threatening Darth Vader. My own disappointment with his performance in this movie was that he didn't get a chance to really lose his cool, and demonstrate the underlying impatience, and tendency towards the Dark Side.",8,1,4,29 August 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Fun little character study
","This is a fun little story with three great performances.  When I heard about the plot, I instantly thought of an old Tony Curtis movie THE GREAT IMPOSTOR, which is one of my all-time favorites.  While this one doesn't quite have the timing or panache of that old gem, it holds up on its own terms surprizingly well.<Possible spoiler warning!> The best thing about this film is the way two pro actors like Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks are used in juxtaposition to each other.  I thought the combination worked very well.  It was also good fun to watch Leo go from a gawky high-school teen to a 'wise beyond his years' slobbish 20-yo(!).  Some of Leo's scenes are a bit too posturing (like the printing press scene), but I thought the story played smoothly most of the way through.  And Christopher Walken gave a nice understated performance as the old Dad, which seems to be his stock-in-trade character nowadays.Certainly a great film to watch, which tries to catch some of the panache of the old comic classics; and almost succeeds.",8,1,2,16 January 2003
Finding Neverland," Fantasy squelched by schmaltz
","This is a reasonably interesting and fascinating look at J M Barrie, and his relationship with the Llewellyn-Davies family, and his inspiration for one of the greatest literary pieces in English - Peter Pan.The recreation of the original stage productions was very interesting and impressive. The actors playing the actors were very fun and sincere, and the whole backstage subplot was certainly a highlight of the film.Johnny Depp has certainly come a long way in his career, and this role is certainly a demonstration of the nuance and emotional depth he can achieve in his performances now. Very dramatic serio-comedy with a large dose of imagination seems to be his specialty. I can remember when he was just a young teen magazine heart-throb starring in a TV drama show with ambitions of being a pop star. And I thought the oldest son George was very convincing and well-played, with another good performance that mixes light comedy and light drama.(Spoiler Warning)But this storyline is totally killed by the deadly slow pacing, self conscious 'serious' drama delivery, maudlin story developments, and heavily clichéd 'big sentimental tearful' moments. The final scene had me heading for the doors in stomach-churning nausea. In fact the whole final fifteen minutes or so just about erased the whole effect of the rest of the film, which I thought was rather tolerable. Let's face it; this script has 'pretentious award-nominated' practically stamped all over it. It doesn't really say anything meaningful to a contemporary viewer. It's just a cynical exercise in emotional manipulation which is what's passing off for 'serious, legitimate, proper drama' in modern cinema.Sure, the idea that people need to keep their inner child and be accessible to the vivid imagination within is a commendable theme. But illustrating it with a sentimental character death and feel-good phrases presented by a weeping child is not the most creative or interesting way to present the idea. It's almost like we're going backwards to the sensibilities of the Victorian Age all over again. I guess Peter Allen got it right - 'Everything Old Is New Again'.",5,18,32,12 January 2005
Shakespeare in Love," Brilliant hypothetical historic story
","This is a absolutely fantastic story about the hypothetical rise of the playwright Will Shakespeare in Elizabethan England.It reminds me of a comedy sketch I saw on an Australian high school English education tv program.. Francis Bacon visits Shakespeare in his cottage and asks what's he doing.  Shakespeare replies he's got this fantastic idea for a new show called The Shakespeare Follies.  'It's got dancers, one ... no TWO swan boats, a full scale army, and the works.'  Bacon looks across to a table and sees a pile of manuscripts, and asks what they are.  'Oh, they're some other plays I've been trying to put together.  They don't seem to be working that well.  One's about a Danish prince seeking revenge, another's about an old King having trouble with his daughters.  Another is about a Scottish monarch having encounters with witches.  Stuff like that.  But this, THIS is going to be my magnum opus.  I wonder if we can get some exotic animals on the stage, and two full armies, and ladies in pretty dresses on swings, and...'  Part of me would like to think Shakespeare may have been a LITTLE like this.Joseph Fiennes handles the character excellently, seeming to give him some warmth and personality to what must have been a daunting role.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a lot of stature, poise and personality to her role as the female lead (this is significant in this story).  Commendations also to Ben Affleck, Rupert Everett, Martin Clunes, Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench, Colin Firth, and especially Geoffrey Rush for providing an excellent comic foil.And congratulations should definitely go to the writers for putting together a snappy storyline with the material.  This is what creative talent can really do.A top class piece of entertainment that thoroughly deserves all the plaudits it can get.",10,2,4,2 May 2002
Beauty and the Beast," Totally beautiful
","This is a masterpiece of beautiful animation and top-class storytelling. It effectively combines humour and pathos in an effective blend of music, personality and pacing. It is one of my top ten all-time favorite movies!It is great to see the way the makers have combined elements of the old-style Hollywood movies; especially with the villagers attack scene, the wolves attack and Gaston's wooing of Belle. And with the modern fluid presentation of the 'Be Our Guest' number (with elements very reminiscent of DUMBO's 'Pink Elephants on Parade'), and the big ballroom title number.I love the way the personality of the characters comes through; especially Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, the Featherduster, Chip and Lefou. And the music really captures the feel of the story excellently. A truly masterful piece of high-quality entertainment that anyone can enjoy - both the original and large screen versions.",10,2,2,14 April 2002
Spider-Man 2," Great fun; but have they jumped the shark?
","This is a great fun summer blockbuster of a movie, with great visually effects and a nice balance of action and humanity.
* * Possible Spoiler Warning * *
Tobey Maguire demonstrates a deadpan comic delivery brilliantly, especially at the party scene when he misses all the cocktails.  And the newspaper editor is still top fun as well.  In this sequel we also have the addition of the landlord's daughter, and even several passer-by kids (especially the ones who comment on Peter flipping over a racing car).But like a lot of people, I am definitely wondering if the storyline has shot itself in the foot, and given away too much too quick.  There seem to be a heck of a lot of revelations in this movie, with about 99% of the dramatic tensions set up in the first film all sorted out.  Sure, there is an obvious setup for an inevitable sequel, and the energy hasn't lost any steam (and of course there are a whole multitude of villains and other plot devices in the source material).  But I am of the feeling that this may have taken away most of the dramatic punch out of the whole series.",8,0,0,13 July 2004
The Great Dictator," This is the one that finally won me over to Chaplin.
","Yes, well ... I've always said Buster Keaton was my favorite classic comic of all-time. Especially masterpieces like THE GENERAL, and SHERLOCK JUNIOR, Keaton was actually **funny**; while Chaplin tended to be **just** simply cute and sweet (obvious connection to modern humour there).Now I've just seen this one, and I've finally admitted that Chaplin does have the knack to be out-and-out rib-ticklingly hilarious. Of course, I could also have remembered classics like 'Easy Street' and of course 'Modern Times' (which I really have to check upon again); but definitely in this film, there were scenes that were so perfect and spot-on hilarious, with impeccable timing and pure side-splitting hilarity.Not only the famous 'playing with the world scene'; but the whole opening segment with the Big Bertha gun; including the bit with the anti-aircraft gun, the walking through the smoke scene, and of course the upside-down aircraft bit. Pure comic genius!!!And to top it off; the absolute satirical punch of the Dictator Hynkle - the speeches, the gestures, the bits with the microphones, the competition with Napolini... And I think Jack Oakie has to be totally on par with Chaplin in this movie. The sheer gusto of the big guy's performance is breathtaking. Especially the classic 'food fight' scene! This film has all the great comic bits!Another actor that doesn't get enough credit I think in most discussions of this movie is Henry Daniell. I just saw him a few months back in TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS - the difference in character between that and this is quite amazing. Further proof that with the right material, a very serious drama actor can be a great choice for a comic movie. (Am I the only one who Garbitch reminds of Professor Snape? Not knocking either character or anything, though.)And the final big point - just look at the date this film was released (1940 - right in the middle of WWII.) Talk about topical! Can you imagine any filmmaker today who would have the guts to make this type of movie about a subject matter that was hitting the headlines so blatantly? It would be like the Farrally brothers today doing a trash comedy about Osama Bin Laden - (and I know just mentioning the idea is going to have some people flame me ferociously!) And to think modern filmmakers think they're 'so current and trendy - not like the olden days when people just made frivolous entertainment.' Ha! Double Ha!Thie is a true comic masterpiece. It made my top 100 list.",10,2,4,1 August 2005
Home Alone," Great comic revival movie
","This is a great comic story that launched a new child star into the Hollywood stratosphere, and understandably so.This film does show off Macaulay Culkin's brilliant comic execution. Apparently, it was partly the result of John Hughes being impressed with Macaulay's performance in UNCLE BUCK, and was devised as a vehicle for him. What makes this film superior to its imitators and successors is that Kevin is allowed to show comic skills and still come across as a genuine kid.  For example; he wants to watch adults only movies, but he freaks out when he actually sees them.  He wants to shave like his dad, but howls when he applies after-shave lotion. And so on.  The christmas scene in the church is a nice humanitarian touch that later Hollywood kids movies lacked.  The character isn't just a minature adult in a child's body.  This gives the story a lot more personality and depth than the other films of its kind.In fact I think Macaulay demonstrated with this film, the interview scene in UNCLE BUCK, The Nutcracker and other performances that he was (and possibly still is) the best comic actor of his generation.  (Well, a tie between him and Joseph Gordon-Levitt at least).",9,0,1,30 March 2002
Gettysburg," Great historic drama
","I thought this was a very good piece of historic storytelling. Being an Australian, I compared it very favorably to the movie and historical incident of GALLIPOLI, which I think this is an approximate American equivalent.I thought the starring roles were handed very decently, and I was surprised that I could follow most of the tactics and locations fairly easily. I thought the Raiders charge was a particular highlight, and the Little Roundtop attacks were very well staged. My only regret is that President Lincoln's famous Address wasn't handled at the end.All in all, I think this is a very watchable dramatization of an exciting and important historical event.",9,2,2,13 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Cool looking movie
","<Possible minor spoiler warning>This is  a very good looking movie with some really tight scenes.  Most notable is the early vehicle chase scene, the arena scene, and the whole final battle - both outside and inside.Particular commendation should go to the production designers of this movie for their fabulous work; especially the vehicles.  I absolutely drooled over the transport vehicle in the beginning, the omnibus vehicle,  and the helicopter-type vehicles in the final big armoured battle sequence.  They all had this retro-50s look which really worked well.  And the tiger-like creature is really effective too.I actually thought Episode I really wasn't as bad as most people reckoned, but this film is definitely far hipper; with a lot keener sense of timing and humour.  It never quite gets up to the personality of the original Episode IV, but this is definitely working as a story in its own right.",8,0,1,5 June 2002
10 Things I Hate About You," Top-class comic timing
","This is a really top-class comic film, with brilliant timing, and a great cast.I especially loved Joseph Gordon-Levitt (with his great 'off-the-cuff' delivery, especially in the first couple of scenes); Larry Miller as the father (natch!); and also Alison Janney as the guidance counselor - I think this was the first time I noticed her.I also loved Heath Ledger's rendition of 'Can't Take My Eyes Off of You'; and also around the climactic ball scene where the two romantic leads are 'comparing notes' with each other. A very well-written and well-produced movie.",9,4,5,27 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," My personal favorite of the trilogy
","I know it's not fashionable at this time, but I do consider this to be my favorite one in the series.The introduction of the shire was very well done, and magical. The opening scene between Frodo and Gandalf had a lot of personality; thematic without being preachy, and setting up ideas without giving too much of the plot away. Gandalf and Bilbo played off each other brilliantly. The special effects (especially with demonstrating the size difference of the various species) was impressive, without being distracting. And Bilbo's birthday was fun and lighthearted, but still with the sinister undertone foreboding the future turmoil. At this stage in the story, I was well on my way to putting the series in my top 100 list; but subsequent scenes and the later movies caused me to lower my rating a fraction. Still - the trilogy overall gets an 8/10 from me.I am very impressed by Peter Jackson with his effective mixture of humor and suspense/horror. I rank the dinner scene between Pippin and Merry as one of the best comic relief moments in a non-comic story ever. And Sean Astin's Samwise had the same serio-comic mixture, spot on perfect. (I always knew Sean had a good knack for doing both comedy and drama - he's always demonstrated it).A few minor quibbles I had with this movie were Frodo's gratuitous cameo shot in the party scene - which I felt looked staged and forced; and the very heavy-handed thematic speeches in the climactic discussion between Frodo and Boromir (premonition to the way-too-much moralizing in the city scene of THE TWO TOWERS).Yeah, I know this is a serious fantasy, and it's very important for characters to make thematic statements in order for the intelligentsia to justify telling a fictional story (apparently); but really, do you have to be so bleedin' obvious about it?! Can't you give the viewers a little credit for working out the underlying themes for themselves, without totally spoon-feeding us on every psychological nuance with the subtlety of a sledgehammer? Honestly, most summer blockbusters can get away with the barest minimum of character development, and a lot of viewers still follow the storyline pretty closely anyway. Not all of us are dumb popcorn-munching idiots!Anyway, griping aside; this is still great epic storytelling. The casting, the art direction and the pacing are (in the main) top quality. It was great intelligent entertainment! After all, this is the most critically-acclaimed popularly entertaining film trilogy of all time - and deservedly so!!!",8,2,4,6 October 2004
Armageddon," The way an action movie works
","This is great fun escapist entertainment. What really makes it work, and what most professional critics don't seem to get, is the way the movie shows the events and situations without the characters sounding like they're self-consciously trying to deliver textbook dramatic theory. The credit should really go to the various performers for managing to make their characters **chat**!!!Particularly notable is the performances of Steve Buscemi as 'So what, are we getting hazard pay for this?' Rockhound and Peter Stomare as the whacked-out cosmonaut. They are examples of giving a story personality, and not just playing by the book. Of course Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton as the leads also give their characters real punch and panache too. This is especially evident with the negotiation scene. 'None of them want to pay taxes again ... ever.' Sure, it's escapist fantasy, but the dialog and personality makes it come alive.Even Ben Affleck's gun-ho young heart-throb character is delivered with personality - including the widely-criticised animal cracker scene. It's important to remember that Affleck's character AJ is NOT meant to be a professional impersonator. He's just a deep-sea oil rigger who's casually goofing around with his girl. I think Affleck hits the characterization perfectly. (It certainly plays a lot better, with more personality and humor, than the equivalent heavy-handed sobbing melodrama of the bus-leaving scene in DEEP IMPACT!)Other scenes that shows why this film worked with the general public, and outstripped its competition are the casino and examination scenes. They give insights into the idiosyncrasies and traits of the individual characters, without them sounding as though they're reading their own character descriptions.Sure, this isn't going to qualify any viewer for rocket science, or help make the world a better place to live; but as professional escapist fictional mass entertainment, this really kicks some butt.",8,2,3,25 April 2002
Pitch Black," Nice (ha, ha)!
","I actually like this little sci-fi thriller. It's very psychological, in-your-face without being excessively graphic or mystically weird. It has some nice suspense moments, good character tension, tight action scenes and a few neat little twists. (They surprised me at any rate; the characters who survive to the end aren't the ones I'd usually expect).I thought the color filter tricks and warped lenses got a bit annoying. And also some of the arguments felt a little over-forced; but I've come to expect that from low budget fare.All I can say is I've seen a few better, and many a heck of a lot worse than this one! If you haven't seen it; it's certainly worth your while.",8,0,0,5 September 2004
The Patriot," Top historic-based action
","This is a top action-drama story with equal amounts of human relationships and war, plus a hint of comedy (I think the running bit with the chair is very effective).SPOILER WARNINGI think special commendation should go to some of the supporting cast in this story for really giving it a lot of personality. Well, Tom Wilkinson would probably prefer to be called a co-star, but anyway he definitely give his character the right amount of political intrigue and ambition as the English general, while still finding room for some humour and other sensitive qualities - so his character's not totally two-dimensional. And Peter Woodward as his aide-de-camp I thought was a very fascinating character, holding together the scenes he figures in with real panache (the best being his entrance with the captured 'officer'). And finally I would like to point out Trevor Morgan who plays the third son Nathan, as really making his character both humorously and dramatically successful.I think I could count on the fingers of one hand the times when a film has actually brought a tear to my eye; and this film is one of them. (Yes, I'm usually the hard, cynical observer who knows all the tricks.) But both the scenes where the son gets shot, and the one where the girl finally decides to speak to her father managed to finally choke me up. It's probably because they're the type of characters who are trying not to cry and do it anyway, as opposed to the usual soap opera sort who will pour on the waterworks at the slightest provocation.This certainly deserves its place in my top 100 movie list!",10,2,3,29 March 2002
Spider-Man," Top comic book adaptation
","This is a brilliant adaptation of a comic book character, capturing both the fantasy action elements, and the wit and humanity.  I thought the third act dialogue sounded a tiny bit cliched, but overall the concept was brilliant. I think congratulations should go not only to the director and main cast, but the supporting players as well - particularly the guy who plays the newspaper editor.  He did a 'stereotypical' comic book humorously hard-nosed boss to perfection (something I thought modern Hollywood couldn't do anymore!)Great movie; a very worthy summer blockbuster (and how often do you hear someone say that?)",9,0,0,6 July 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Good, but not great
","This is certainly a very visually slick movie, with an great cast ensemble. (It's fantastic to see veteran comic actor/director Carl Reiner in a role again!) The best scene is the card game early in the story, (the one that features Joshua Jackson in a cameo). It has good personality and tension and a lot of style.I think the main problem with this movie is that it 'shoots its wad' too early. There are great set pieces and twists in the first two-thirds, and then it all peters out at the end. Sonderbergh seem to fall back to his art-house roots and gives us a lot of pretty pictures and a loud soundtrack, while the plot just fizzles out and the movies cruises to the end on sheer charm alone.I'm going to stick my neck out here and say I think the original Rat Pack film actually worked better. It saved it's biggest twist to the end, right before the classic final shot of them strolling down the street; and actually maintained a strong plot line right to the end.Of course, both of them pale in comparison with the leading films of the genre; THE STING and THE Italian JOB.",7,0,1,22 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Up and Down
","This movie reminds me of an old nursery rhyme: 'There was a little girl, who had a little curl / right in the middle of her forehead. When she was good, she was very, very good. And when she was bad she was horrid.' You can also sum up this story by saying in the main that the parts in the air are terrific, and the bits on the ground are rather bad.A good example or this is the romance segment between Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale's characters. When they're flying in the air, it is really touching and effective. When they get back on the ground, it all gets tacky and clichéd. Again with Ben Affleck in Britain. The scenes in the air are breathtaking; while the shenanigans on the ground are pretty awful.Exceptions are the guy with the stutter, who I thought was very good; and the draft examination sequence, which I thought worked rather well. Also, despite the strong criticism, I thought Alec Baldwin was terrific as Doolittle; and the famed raid on Tokyo was a good climactic coda. But again; while the characters are in the air or around the aircraft; it goes brilliantly. Once they crash onto the ground, the film literally drops away into schmaltz.I have to say that I still prefer TORA TORA TORA as the better dramatization of this story, especially Jason Robards and Martin Balsam's characters. (My Dad totally loves this version however.) The best way to sum up this film is to say that, while it's not the great masterpiece it's obvious trying to be, it isn't nearly as bad as the critics who savaged it reckoned. It's just a moderately entertaining little story:- but that's something Hollywood doesn't ever seem to want to admit to now, is it?",7,0,1,3 October 2003
The Usual Suspects," Top heist thriller
","This is a deservedly acclaimed thriller movie that is brilliantly written and executed.My biggest hint to those who haven't seen this movie is to pay close attention to the opening scene, and keep it in mind throughout the rest of the story; it is very important.  And remember the way the story is unfolding.<SPOILER WARNING>For those who have seen the story, I have to say my fav scene is the penultimate one where the central character thinks he's got caught, and is getting ready to plea bargain.  That and the scene where Chazz Palminteri's character first bursts in and demands Kevin Spacey's character tell him about Kaiser Souze are the two most effective and secretly revealing scenes in the story.  They're the ones that work effectively no matter what your reading of the film is.",9,0,1,27 May 2003
Independence Day," Storytelling par excellence
","I STILL rank this as top-grade storytelling. In fact I think this is one of the few films I've seen where practically all the main characters (including the females) sound like a group of top-class well-trained professionals trying to work out a complex (if admittedly unusual) situation without all instantly jumping to the stock drama textbook conclusion.In case you haven't heard how the idea came about, the story goes that Roland Emmerich was giving a press conference in Europe for his film STARGATE when a reporter asked if he believed in UFOs. He said he didn't, but went on to say that if a whole heap of spaceships appeared over Earth's cities, it would cause a lot of people to really sit up and think. Thus the idea for the story was born.One of the things that attracts me to this movie is the little details that give the story a personality. One of my favorites is the newscaster who says 'LA residents are warned not to fire their guns at the spaceship, as it may cause an interstellar incident'. It shows personality, sounds authentic, and is very ironic considering what happens afterward. And how many standard sci-fi films would have their characters accidentally back the spacecraft up while trying to take off? It's story moments like that which make the difference between a good movie and a great one. Most of the more critically-acclaimed and lower budget films don't have stuff like that (they usually can't afford to). This is when the characters sound like they give a hoot, and not like they're just brainlessly following the script. (Yes, alright; I know they REALLY are, but at least they don't sound like it!)I think it's what attracted a lot of viewers to the movie and decided to reject the critics' overwhelming advice; which hadn't happened for quite awhile when this movie was released (and the critics are still resentful of that). I can remember on a current affairs TV show when a critic unusually came on and said; 'This is the worst movie ever made! No-one should ever watch it!' (And the critics accuse the general public of being simplistic and unsophisticated?!?)Still, I guess that sums up the eternal dilemma. Most film critics go to a movie to see how the film-maker presents themes and how well they live up to the abstract drama theory; whereas most members of the general public go to a movie to watch an entertaining story!",10,0,1,22 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," 'Fish & Chips' scene brilliant
","I just want to say that the 'fish & chips' argument between Gollum and Samwise in this film is one of my favorite pieces of dramatization.It works because the scene reveals so much about the characters and the underlying themes of the story, without the whole thing sounding like a self-conscious English Literature essay. With Gollum having total spasms about the way Sam's 'ruining' the food, and Sam stuck in the traditional ways of Hobbit cooking, the interaction between the conflicting character points of view is brilliantly realized in a novel and interesting way. It's in scenes like this where dramatization really works best.On the other hand, I have to say in contrast that the big 'important stories' speech in both the white city scene and at the end when the two hobbits are walking off is one of the worst pieces of heavy-handed moralizing I've ever heard. It sound really labored and forced and really doesn't fit the context of the situation too well at all.The Helms Deep battle is certainly a highlight of the movie - in fact the whole trilogy! It's very well set-up and executed (pardon the pun!); while providing some great character interaction. I personally enjoyed the comic relief moments with the rivalry between Gimli and Legolas. Legolas' style at mounting his transport was very impressive. Some of the best character moments in this movie is when Frodo defends Gollum to Samwise, and also Merry and Pippin play off each other very well while being held by the Orcs, then running and meeting Treebeard. And the final battle of the Ents with Sauroman is a great climactic moment.",8,0,0,22 March 2004
Schindler's List," The Best Drama, with top comic asides.
","I rank this as THE best drama story ever. When it got released, I was chatting with a co-worker in the staff room who said: 'I know I should see this movie, but I don't think I could handle sitting through two hours of watching people suffer in the concentration camps.' and I totally agreed. If only we'd realized how great this film tells its story.I think a scene that best demonstrates this film is the Train Rescue scene. I can just imagine a lesser production putting a heavy-handed sentimental moralistic sob speech right in the middle of it (which would have turned Oskar into a very quick martyr for sure). Instead, the characters are trying to cope with the immediate concerns of the situation. They're almost in a state of self-denial about the implications of what's going on; and it's left to the unspoken sequence at the end to bring home the emotional impact. As Alfred Hitchcock said: 'A good filmmaker doesn't tell you something, he shows you something'.Another aspect that makes this film work, and one I don't think gets acknowledged too much, is it's effective use of dark humor. Examples include the Chicken Thief scene, and Oskar negotiating with the Aucshwitz Commandant. (I also reckon the sequence where Goeth tries out Oskar's 'benevolence is power' idea, and decides it doesn't work is humorous - but that may be just me!). This film almost has the personality of a Hogan's Heroes episode - and I mean that as a sincere complement.It reminds me of a Yiddish joke I heard about a Nazi sympathizer and a Jewish businessman who bump into each other on a street corner at the start of WW2. The Nazi sympathizer snaps 'Schweinhund!!!' and stalks off in a huff. The Jewish businessman brushes himself off, tips his hat, and murmurs; 'And **I'm** Goldberg.'But the thing that really makes this film work is the fact that is plays on the viewer's expectations. The film is made for people who have seen WW2 documentaries, and think they know what happened. The prime example is the shower scene (which I think is more psychological than PSYCHO). This film works because it doesn't preach at you, it plays the situations and asks you to respond to them. And I think that's the secret of great storytelling.",10,9,13,7 March 2002
The Incredibles," Incredibly great fun storytelling
","This is a top class, incredibly great fun computer animated story that spoofs comic book heroes and Bondian adventure stories, in the guise of a look at a 'typical' American suburban family.Think the premise of the LOST IN SPACE movie where a sci-fi-ish type story acts as the basis for character conflicts of a small family group. Now think of the THUNDERBIRDS movie where those conflicts are played out on a large action-packed stage in a faraway tropical island. Now ... imagine a film where those ideas was played in such a creative way that they actually ***worked***!!! Then you have THE INCREDIBLES.(Spoiler Warning)The set-up is brilliant; starting off with a TRUMAN SHOW type idea of superheroes being interviewed about their work, and their reaction to their lifestyle. Then we have a set-up which demonstrates our main heroic lead, Mr Incredible, saving the day with bank robbers and a cat - all while on the way to his wedding with another superhero - Elastagirl. Then the complications set in; some unscrupulous lawyers are taking advantage of the consequences of our hero's good deeds, and superheroes fall out of favor with the general public. They all go into hiding.Cut to several years later where the ex-Mr Incredible and Elastagirl, aka The Parrs, are trying to live 'normal' lives as a suburban family; with their children - a angsty teenage daughter, a hyperactive young son and a baby. Mr Parr has a dead-end job at an insurance company with a midget of a boss; the two eldest children are having difficulties coping with the pressure of school life, and the tension is starting to cause things to break - literally. Then, suddenly, Mr Incredible is secretly called away to a dangerous mission requiring the work of a superhero again. But everything isn't as cosy as it seems...In the style of playing a typical sitcom-type domestic drama up against the shenanigans of comic book escapist fantasy and James Bond type adventure, Brad Bird has managed to hit a winning combination that plays to the strengths of both genres without falling for the pitfalls of either mostly. Craig Nelson and Holly Hunter as the voices of the two leads manage a good balance of warmth and strength to their performances. In addition to writing and directing, Brad Bird does additional duties as the voice of the hilarious fashion Meister Edna Mode, with some of the best one-line throw-away situations in the story; and Bird's son Nicholas (who played Squirt in FINDING NEMO) gets to play a young boy watching on the sidelines who acts as a Greek chorus to the domestic situation. And Kevin Smith stalwart Jason Lee has a great role in the obsessed fan who becomes the prime antagonist.The computer animation has again moved ahead with this film, the water effects (especially with the wet hair) was particularly impressive. I always thought that computer-drawn humans in the past have tended to look very anorexic; but finally they had some muscle added to their figures. And the set detail on the island, which is the stage for most of the action sequences, is very rich and colorful; it seems to be a homage to my fav Bond movie YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE with a bit of the THUNDERBIRDS, FANTASY ISLAND and THE PRISONER thrown into the mix. Plus the comic timing and panache of the whole story really holds the whole thing together - making for one helluva tight movie!Great fun story, that should hold up for quite a few years. My biggest regret is that the brilliant scene in the initial trailer wasn't included. Oh well, can't win 'em all now - can we?",10,0,1,27 December 2004
The Game," Great fun little mystery thriller
","This is a top notch mystery thriller, with a suburb cast and great staging. Michael Douglas and Sean Penn are outstanding in their roles as two wealthy brothers, with Sean playing the quirky younger one who gives his elder brother a very unusual birthday present.The story does play on a lot of modern suburbanite fears of home invasion, being watched, trapped by technology etc.  And even if the ending feels a little too neat and implausible, it is really a great ride of a movie with some elegant sophistication thrown in.",9,0,1,22 February 2004
The Longest Day," The best D-Day dramatization
","I like this version of the D-Day WW2 Normandy landings the best. You get to see both sides of the conflict; from the Allied and German perspectives. Unlike most 60s/70s epics, the multi-national all-star cast is actually an asset in this film. They show the various incidents and locations a lot clearer than an whole heap of unknowns would. The characters sound very sincere and involved, with a good mix of comedy and tragedy.This was Hollywood honcho Darryl Zanuck's pet project for an anti-war drama, and it works very well. And the title music by talented music artist Paul Anka is very catchy. Sure, this hasn't got the high gross-out impact for a post-Vietnam audience that certain later efforts do (How could it?); but at dramatizing the situation, this is a lot easier to follow.I would strongly recommend that you try and see the colorized version as it's a lot easier to watch; especially in noticing scenic details and when reading the subtitles. (There's absolutely nothing worse that trying to read white subtitles on a white background!!!)",9,7,12,25 April 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," An extremely sensitive and poignant animated film.
","This is one of the most touching stories I have ever seen. Everything about it clicked beautifully. It was sensitive and emotional, without feeling sappy or too manipulative.The contrast between a teenage boy and a little girl trying to live their lives, and the ravages of war around them was a very strong and moving idea.The standard conceits of anime with large sappy eyes and small mouth movements with short pithy dialog wasn't at all distracting in this.(Spoiler warning)One of my favorite scenes is the sequence when Seito gets caught for stealing and is taken to the police, thus forced to abandon his little sister. The officer turns out to be very understanding, and the young teen Seito is quickly released; only to find that his sister has followed him into town, and is more concerned for him than her own well-being. The contrasts and emotions of the scene are very deep and effective. I loved it because it said a lot without being too heavy-handed.In fact, one of the greatest attributes of this story is its gentle underhanded approach. A few little moments add up to a great deal of philosophical themes, which whole pages of text couldn't really describe.It's really great to see an animated film deal with a very serious and tragic subject matter, once in a while.",9,15,20,11 November 2004
Shrek 2," Top fun all over!!!
","This is definitely my fav movie so far this year!It has definitely not disappointed as a sequel to the 2001 smash hit.  I try not to decide which is the better, I think the two run together tight enough to be considered one complete story.I agree Puss In Boots practically steals the show.  I love the scene when he and Fiona first meet.  Perhaps the sappy eyes bit could have been used a BIT too often, but that's only a minor little quibble.  In fact my only real complaint is that the pop references and gags come in a bit TOO fast, almost overwhelming the basic plotline.  But what the hell? Everyone should just go and have a jolly old time with this one!",10,0,1,13 July 2004
Titanic," Actually good storytelling
","Despite the fashionable negative reviews that a lot of film snobs seem to pass on this movies, it actually is a very good telling of a famous story. I admit when I went to see this movie, I thought I'd be cheering for the iceberg. But the dramatization does work very well, with characters who have engaging personalities, and the right mix of drama and humor.SPOILER WARNINGI am a bit disappointed that my fav line from this movie - 'Why do the British have to announce dinner like it's a cavalry charge?' - turned out to be 'borrowed' from the 1956 Clifton Webb version. Actually I think the really far-fetched bit of storytelling is how Rose survives after diving in and out of the allegedly-freezing cold water about five or six times. She gets wet more often that Jack does! I can only figure she must be full to the brim on alcohol (which may explain a lot - ha, ha!)Still, the story is delivered very effectively and keeps you involved all the way through. The contrasts between the early part of the 20th century, and the modern salvage expedition scenes is very thematically effective. It certainly gives a new and interesting perspective, and helps the modern viewer relate to the events. Great storytelling device. I also recommend that people should check out the telemovie made the year before with Barry Pepper and Catherine Zeta Jones. That one works quite well too, especially for a lower budget.",9,1,5,12 September 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great British children's fantasy
","In the tradition of classic Roald Dahl stories like The Witches, Matilda, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (the movie script) comes this feature version of the top selling children's novel. Forget all the hype, marketing and rigmarole surrounding the movie and just watch a great fun modern fantasy story.This comment is based purely on the movie alone; as I haven't read the books. The leads are well cast; with Daniel Radcliffe showing great poise in the title role; and Rupert Grint providing great comedy as Weasley (who seems to get the bulk of the fun dialogue); and Robbie Coltrane practically steals the show as Hagrid.The set pieces are very well executed; particularly the ball game (very reminiscent of the Ben Hur chariot race or Phantom Menace pod race); and the boy out of control on the broom (I LOVE the way the broom bounces off the buildings!).This story seems to tap into the traditions of Old English school novels like Tom Brown's School Days; and there also seems to be a hint of satire of the English class system. The one disappointing thing I felt with this film was the contrived way the school house won the contest at the end. I think it might have been a bit more mature to have the rival win, and show you can't win at everything all the time. (but then, I'm probably just an old, cynical muggle!). All in all, great fun modern entertainment well worth watching.",9,0,0,15 March 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Great story, if a bit self-conscious and gimmicky
","This is a very fast-pace, visually stunning sci-fi noir story with some ripper effects and very tight dialog.SPOILER WARNINGMy fav scene is the night dialog in the engineering section. The conversation is straight to the point, clever, and chatty, without trying to be too precocious. And the famous freeway scene is very impressive.What I did not like about the story were the cliffhanger ending, the all-too arty and overused slow-motion-in-the-middle-of-the-scene effects, and the less-than-subtle references to Greek mythology, Eastern mysticism and pseudo-theology/psychology. (Yeah I know a lot of geeks are really into that stuff, but it doesn't turn me on that much).I have to say I'm very cautious about stories with an ultra-dark mystical occultish horror tone, which is why I've avoided movies like THE EXORCIST, the OMEN series, ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE SIXTH SENSE. No, I am ***not*** a complete puritanical wowser killjoy, and I've got nothing against people who are into that sort of thing. It's just my personal decision for my life, okay?Anyway, besides my own little bug-bears this is a great story and top-class caricaturisation, especially Hugo Weaving, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Laurence Fishburn, Anthony Zerbe, and of course Keanu Reeves.",8,0,0,27 May 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," Man, this works!
","This is absolutely top class story telling at a magnificent level.I get the impression that the attitude in the 20s-50s wasn't that much different that the general attitude today. People were rather cynical about cute fantasy, were out trying to earn a quick dollar, and pined for the simpler times of 'the good old days', without quite knowing how to achieve it.There's an old public speaker saying that a good communicator need to 'reach people where they're at in order to lead them to where he wants them to go'. Frank Capra seems to have developed this knack to an admirable degree. His style of so-called 'Capracorn', has this amazing ability to present a strong emotional idea without going **too** over-the-top. Just when you think that a film is starting to get very sentimental, maudlin or 'corny'; then up pops a good comic relief moment, or a bit of sharp drama - just to ease the schmaltz back to an acceptable level. It's a real shame that most film directors haven't managed to quite get the knack of knowing when to say an idea, and knowing when to NOT say an idea. When to state the theme, and when to infer it.This technique really works to best example in Capra's top three masterpieces; MEET JOHN DOE, MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, and this movie - IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Anyone who dismisses this story as pure cornball holiday sentimentality really needs to play close attention to how the story actually operates.Lionel Barrymore has for a long time been one of my favorite character actors from the classic Hollywood period, and here he plays the main antagonist with just the right mixture of spite and comedy. And quite frankly, the scene where James Stewart's George Bailey loses it in front of his family is actually quite gut-wrenching stuff; almost on par with the standard hard-hitting scenes of modern dramas. It's just the right amount of dramatic force to stop the story from getting 'too cute'.Of course there is also the scenes that have now become classics, which occur mainly in the climactic third act. George losing his identity, seeing a new and different Bedford Falls - or 'Pottersville' - then regaining his identity and finally wishing everyone a 'Merry Xmas'. (I was actually quite amazed that most of the film is actually a narrative back story, leading up to the memorable classic moments; and it does in fact work very well in that way.) Combine this with the great fun gym/pool dance sequence and the subsequent bush scene, and you've got the makings of a top-notch storyline; that totally deserves its current status as a perennial classic.",9,1,6,26 September 2004
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," I am TOTALLY green with envy at Kenneth Branagh!
","Prof Lockhart is the sort of character I would in my wildest dreams have loved to play. As the conceited, flamboyant, secretly craven rogue who's a little too outspoken to be likable, he's the sort of character I would die to perform.With that aside, I think this film should be congratulated for keeping the personality and characterization that made the first one such a popular success. Yes, the series is getting darker and sinister, and (IMHO) is losing the distinctiveness from the rival LOTR that made the first one so memorable; but the characters are still great fun to watch, have a wonderful chemistry, and the whole effect still clicks very well.Rupert Grint is still displaying a great knack for comic delivery, Daniel Radcliffe still has the balance of mischievousness and seriousness that makes him such an excellent lead. And Emma Watson is definitely maturing in the role like a full-grown expert.I thought the final climax was a bit too rushed, and forced; it was very difficult to follow all the plot complications (as I'm not familiar with the novel - which the filmmakers shouldn't assume). But this was still great entertainment value. And I think Hugh Mitchell's Colin Creevey is very cute and sweet.",9,0,1,7 October 2004
The Bridge on the River Kwai," One of the best war dramas ever!
","This is an outstanding war drama about the infamous Burmese railway. The most notable character is Colonel Nicholson played by Alec Guinness. His combination of drama and comedy help make his character really come alive.(Spoiler warning!)My favorite scene is when he has been released from the torture box and is inspecting the work site. A soldier is giving a report of the construction and keeps winking at the Colonel in order to indicate they've been secretly sabotaging the project. The Colonel tells him to have the man report to the medical station and have his eye checked. It is a great comic relief moment in a very serious film. One of the other breathtaking scenes is when Colonel Nicholson goes to the hospital and gives a talk to persuade the wounded to work on the site. It is one of the most powerful dramatic scenes I've seen in a movie. The idea is totally outrageous and beggars belief, yet Guinness plays it with utter conviction, and he's very persuasive.The ending does seem a bit too far-fetched and is pushing coincidence to the limit. (I know it differs from the book.) But this is still one of the best dramatic stories ever produced.",10,0,1,6 April 2002
The Green Mile," Good little fantasy/drama
","This is a very good little drama/fantasy story, even if it does fit the the conventions you would expect for a standard 'Oscar nominated/feel-good movie'.  But I don't think it quite lives up to the standards of films like THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION or APOLLO 13 or suchlike.  It's just a little bit too obvious in what it's trying to do and how it pushes the emotional buttons.I think the most outstanding performances were from the 'heavies' of the picture in Doug Hutchinson and Sam Rockwell.  Their characters just push up the story and give a sharp edge to what could have been an overly schmaltzy and preachy plot (which is what I was expecting).  Don't get me wrong, I thought the emotional and spiritual-phylosophcal aspects worked surprisingly well, and I was moved by the tender moments of this story.  I am just glad that it had some dramatic 'bite' to it as well.",8,0,2,1 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Story regains the the dynamics of Episode IV!!!
","The first thing I want to say is that the dialogue in this movie is exceptional. The opening scenes especially feel really dynamic and casual, serious without being pretentious. I'm really regretting the fact that this is the climactic appearances for Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen, because I get the impression they've finally found the right fit for their characters.This story is really very much on par with Episode IV, especially with the pacing and the plot dynamics. It's snappy, with a great balance between light-heartedness and serious themes. I personally think the balance is spot-on here. We've finally gotten rid of the 90s-style self-conscious p/c delivery that was apparent in the first two episodes, and finally have characters that really move and talk with each other.And once again, the art direction in this film is totally breathtaking. The ship designs sets, locations, costumes and props feel just right - alien but still some familiarity. The art deco-style look of the central planet is very chic (same reason I personally loved TITAN A.E. btw), Naboo still looks like a romantic paradise, and the outer war planets and the Wookie world look suitably grim yet photogenic and appropriately thematic.(Main spoilers here)Now for the (minor) quibbles. General Grevious really doesn't work that well. The character is way too clichéd and forced, and the coughing and wheezing feels too unbelievable for a droid character - even one that apparently has a little natural biology buried within it. I know he's meant to be an escapist stooge villain, a blow-hard menace - bur even so, the character still feels thin and under-developed; not really that convincing as a serious threat.And the ending feels a bit too pat and anti-climactic, with too much of a forced shoehorning to Episode IV. Yeah, it was great to see the babies delivered to their adopted homes, to see the big transformation of Anakin to Vader, and to hear the familiar old character themes in the music; but even so the ending actually sort of just peters out, nothing really awe-inspiring or climactic. Even if it is a downer ending, it could have been a bigger one. Something like the final ousting of Bail Organa out of the capital and the Emperor forcing his rule maybe. Or something else big and majestic.But enough of the whining, this is still 99.99% effective. It still is the most awesome sci-fi legendary storytelling we have. Great job; kudos to everyone involved!!! PS: The scene where Yoda knocks the Emperor's guard out of the way got the biggest laugh with the audience I was with - it's a good highlight moment.",9,1,2,31 May 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Beautifully intelligent story
","This very sophisticated and beautifully storytelling, the way a great movie is supposed to be.When I saw the trailers and clips from this movie when it was first released, I thought to myself; 'Yeah right, another self-conscious Oscar-nominated prison dirge with it's heart fastened firmly to it's sleeve'.  I expected it to be another 'worthy' movie like CHATTAHOOCHEE or the usual 80s telemovie types.  It wasn't until I sat down and watched the tv release that i really got involved with the story.I particularly like the way the story has heart and feelings, but is not sappy or pretentious.  There is humour, pathos, tragedy, and irony in equal measure.  So if you're like me and usually don't like ponderous prison dramas, I reckon you should see this movie anyway, and you should  find that it's surprizingly refreshing storytelling.",9,0,0,21 July 2002
The Iron Giant," Rich storytelling
","This is a very rich detailed story with great casting and excellent visual presentation.After seeing this movie I read the original book; and this is one case where the film version actually surpasses the original concept in story detail, characterization, and subtext.I love the political allegory inside this seemingly simplistic tale.  And the details of the plot are magnificent, as is the visualization.  A true masterpiece all-round.",10,0,1,6 July 2002
Shrek," Top class contemporary animated comc fairy tale spin!
","This is a brilliant comic animated fairy tale, with terrific sight gags, rich detailing, and a light twisted sense of humor.  This is professional contemporary entertainment as its most wonderfully creative best.  The voice characterizations are superb, especially the leads of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgow & Cameron Diaz.  The graphic work is breathtaking and the storyline is a wonderfully new interpretation of some classic tales.The big question now is why is animated storytelling doing so well?  I think the reason is that it hasn't yet been subjected to the rigorous critical scrutiny (so far) that professional live-action storytelling has become.  I personally think that live action (especially drama) is so ruthlessly dissected and analysed, that you get the impression the characters can't move an inch without some 'expert' trying to read some deep symbolic significance into it.  And I get the feeling to a certain extent that this is hampering the creative work that great storytelling can do.With the fresh new computer-animated films however, this is not such a problem (yet!).  The form is so free and innovative that the characters can 'break the rules' and get away with it.  (They can even overplay to the hilt and display some rich parody and it actually works--which live-action isn't allowed to get away with anymore.)Maybe in a year or so some dramatic scholar is going to write a big dissertation on how animated films 'should' play, and will probably kill off all the fun and personality out of the storytelling.  Until then, perhaps we should enjoy these stories while they last.",10,0,1,28 August 2002
Amélie," Extremely beautiful cinematic experience.
","This was a very beautiful story, both visually and emotionally. I could relate to the central characters very well, and the outcome was absolutely wonderful.At first I thought the ponderous narration was a bit distracting, and I told myself if this story turned into a tragedy I would hate it. But I soon realized how the narration had a rather droll, tongue-in-cheek feel to it; sometime complementing the action, sometimes playing against it. (Rather like the way THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY works.) And the wrap-up at the end is simply perfect.The colors and locations of this are very striking, and there is a strong artistic theme running through the whole story. It's cute, without being cloying. A brilliant masterpiece of cinematic storytelling all-round.My fav comic line in this (at least according to the subtitles on the version I saw) was the insult: 'His father probably pee'd in his mother when he was conceived.'",10,1,4,5 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The one teensy-weensy quibble (or 2).
","<Spoiler warning!>While it is now generally regarded as an all-time time classic, I would just like to point out the one very tiny teensy-weensy quibble I have with this movie.  (I still gave it a 10!!!)It's about the scene when Luke comes back to Ben after finding his homestead destroyed and Owen & Beru dead.  You'll know Ben does the 'There's nothing you could have done' speech, then Luke does this bit about 'I want to come with you to Alderan' speech.  To me, this speech seems a bit too forced and formal for the situation.  The guy has just lost his primary care-givers and virtually everything he has owned in the world.  I hate to say it, but you would expect him to be a little bit more choked up by the situation.  It sounds like something Princess Leia would say rather than Luke.  I just think this is the one time where the dialogue is pushing the themes at the expense of the believability of the storyline.  (It's the one reason I rank certain other movies a tiny bit better than this one.)Other than that, this is an all time great!  Concerning the special edition; I would like to say that the take-off of the Millenium Falcon from Tatooine is absolutely magnificent; but I'm a bit of a purist and I actually like the original Death Star explosion better than the revamped one.  It just seems a bit TOO flashy (and just why does the shock wave go vertically anyway?).The only other thing to wonder why most critics didn't recognise this as a great (or at least half-decent) story to begin with.  The official explanation that they didn't pick up on the cultural impact is a tad unfair (they could hardly have known that at the films release).  But Gearge Lucas has always stated he was making a modern-day fairy-tale and a Flash Gordon-style story, and you'd think they would have least acknowledged the mastery of the plot at that level.  I can only surmise that they were so used to the standard 70-style self-conscious angst-ridden stories where the characters are heavily overtly thematic, that when a dynamic entertaining story came along they dismissed it purely at face-value; and assumed it couldn't  have any artistic merit.  They failed to realise that a great story has interesting themes INSIDE a good plotline, not INSTEAD of it.",10,0,0,8 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," What I don't like about this one...
","I'm probably gonna be the Most Unfashionable & Despised Reviewer Alive for saying this, but I am not a huge fan of this episode. In fact, I consider it to be the weakest in the story. Now, when you've stopped hyperventilating, I'll explain why.The worst scene I feel is when Luke and Han say goodbye to each other at the ice hanger. One copy of the script I read says that they gaze at each other with a 'deep sense of admiration for the other's wisdom and heroic endeavor' (- or something like that). Well I'm sorry, but all I could see were two truculent teenagers behaving like immature brats. The sexual tension between Han and Leia had, IMHO, been ham-fistedly set up almost from the first scene. In a hectic rush, it felt like the audience was banged over the head that there was 'unresolved chemistry' between the two characters - almost straight out of a dime novel. Which leads to the big farewell scene, and we get that sullen sour look from Han as he and Luke say 'Well, see ya'. (Wow - high quality drama!)**Spoiler warning**And to top that off, just look at how Luke behaves with Yoda. After leaving Hoth, he has this determined quest to find this mysterious individual he's never met, breaking Rebel orders in the process. Then when he crash-lands on the planet, he seems to go into a hissy fit when everything isn't quite what he expected. Then this little green man (believe it or not!), turns up and asks if the young man wants any help. There's some comic schtick as the little fellow bumbles around in the camp, with Luke harping like a nanny throughout. Then the guy beckons the Hero to follows him back to the hut. And Luke, 'with a deep sense of destiny', follows him. They arrive at a little forest house. Luke whines about the situation, and then - (tada!)- we find out that the little fellow is ... Yoda! (Could see that one coming a mile away!!!) So our interstellar hero is then all gushing and plaintive - practically fawning over the little guy!.Geez, the whole episode plays like a two-bit soap.If this is supposed to be the best episode in the series; well I'm sorry, but I'd rather stick to the original. At least that had some style and a tight whup-ass plot! And the sexual tension was handled more subtly, with a tinge of comedy.",6,4,14,24 October 2004
Back to the Future," My all-time fav movie!!!
","[possible spoilers ahead]This qualifies as my all-time fav movie.  The snappy plot-line with some interesting concepts inside make it one heck of a great story.  I think Christopher Lloyd makes almost the definitive absent-minded professor, and Michael J Fox makes a great teen dealing with some 'heavy' issues.  I love the crane shot that establishes the town square.  And you just can't beat that tight climax with the tower and the car!Certainly tops!",10,1,2,3 March 2002
Shark Tale," Good, but probably the start of the B-grade CG movies.
","Don't get me wrong, this is actually quite a dynamic and enjoyable movie. It has a great voice cast, plays very snappily, full of humor and emotion, and certainly works as a fun entertaining story for everyone.I especially enjoyed Martin Scorese in this. I've always thought he makes a neat actor - I also liked his role in QUIZ SHOW, and as a documentary narrator. His character is actually very funny in this; especially the fight scene with the 'turn on the TV, turn off the TV' bit.I also give credit for Jack Black's work. If I hadn't known I would never have recognised his voice in this. It seems one of the few times when a modern actor has been allowed to put on an artificial persona for a role, and get away with it. And I thought the guy who played the octopus was very good, and gave some great personality to the story,And of course Will Smith and Robert DeNiro do hold their own as the central protagonist/antagonist of the story. Perhaps I'm being a bit flippant in almost taking them for granted.One of the scenes I didn't like however, was the big climactic statements in the ending. They are just too over-stated and pushy. The wrap-up is a little too neat and sentimental. In fact the big problem is that the whole story really doesn't seem 'worth it' somehow. It's okay; but compared to some of the great CG animated movies we've been lucky enough to get over the past couple of years, this one does seem a bit second-class. Nice try however, just not totally memorable.",7,2,5,17 October 2004
