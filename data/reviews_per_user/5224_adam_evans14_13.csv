Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," the first chapter of star wars...although not as we expected
","This movie is looked upon as a failure when considering the huge hype that surrounded the release of this film. The reason being is that the script is dull in comparison with large chunks of dialogue becoming tedious after about twenty minutes. Almost all of Natalie Portman's lines are about politics!!! The other perhaps more important reason for this being a flop is that there's a serious lack of continuity with the original saga. Characters such as the viceroy, jar jar Binx,Qui Gon Jin, Darth maul are all introduced and then discarded in the following film. It really would've been better if Qui Gon Jin never existed, and Obi Wan was already the Jedi master and Anakin was his apprentice already...there's no real absolute need to give Anakin a background of being a pod racer with a mother etc All thats really important is that he good and will turn evil. The movies opening sequence is a waste of time because nothing is achieved when concerning developing the films plot....and an hour into watching the film you realise the story hasn't actually taken you anywhere since the opening sequence. I think the scene in which the main characters arrive in Corrosant would have been a nice place to start the film....the just of whats happened could be easily explained in the writing at the start....and maybe episode 2's storyline could be weaved in somehow...like Anakin being hired to protect Padme by the council could occur immediately at the start of this film....the fact that Qui Gon Jin is introduced and Obi Wan his apprentice means Anakin is insignificant and not developed in any way throughout the film.Also jar jar Binx should be axed as he makes the film somewhat childlike.",6,0,1,4 August 2008
The Expendables 2," If you didn't like, well what did you expect?
","So with the release of the Expendables we witnessed a film that possibly can't be repeated in terms of scale. The reason lies with the over the top preoccupation with 'the action flick' in the 80's. So in bringing all these iconic figures of the action genre together the expendables evokes nostalgia among the older audiences while the ignorant can claim they want to see the new Jason Statham film.Indeed my study of film on an academic level has led me to be called a snob somewhat. But, i'm the first to admit i enjoy a tongue in cheek film if it claims not to be anything other. When watching the film I know for a fact that it's written purely for entertainment purposes and nothing else. A popcorn movie. Any critical acclaim would be ludicrous. The films (both this and the first one) openly mock the ridiculousness of the 80's action flicks with outrageous shootouts and a collection of more testosterone than a sperm bank. If Stallone had sat down and claimed the expendables was the best script he's collaborated on one could only assume he's been taking the Spielberg tablets of Indy 4 (note; why i hate films like Indy 4 and Die Hard 4....they're supposed to be more serious whereas expendables you have to take it with a pinch of salt for what it is).One thing that did get on my nerves though was perhaps the scenes involving Arnie. The references to Terminator with the uttering of 'i'll be back' brought a smile at best the first time; but to murder it time and time again at every opportunity got a bit annoying, and ultimately i ended up wishing he'd get shot for it. Considering Arnie was possibly the most famous of the action hero's of the 80's (along with Stallone...take your pick, it's between them two no doubt) i'd have liked to have seen him involved in the film properly and not just for comedic purposes.Also he really looks long in the tooth compared with Stallone who's anti ageing cream could probably rake in more than the gross of Rocky. He's a tank and fair play to him, he looks amazingly good for his age.Should they make an expendables 3? Probably not. I think people would get a bit bored of the chedderness of it, and besides the charm of nostalgia will have worn off by then. However if they did go ahead, i certainly won't protest and it would be interesting to have the full set with the inclusion of Steven Seagal. All in all, if you like dumb action flicks, this will do nicely. But don't tune in expecting an ambiguous and thought provoking film, and be disappointed when you don't get one. If you are then for shame.",Null,3,3,4 May 2013
Citizen Kane," The Father of Film Noir
","For over 70 years now Citizen Kane has been regarded a cinematic masterpiece. So would it shock you to learn that its immediate reception was largely negative. Of course it would. But not for reasons of legitimate value, since the films content is a mirror image of the media tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who was incensed by the film, it was attacked with pitchforks by newspapers all owned by Hearst. Thankfully years later the film is appreciated for what it is. The finest work of an avant garde filmmaking genius in Welles.Lets start with the element of mise en scene (the techniques employed to combine visual elements e.g lighting, camera movement, setting and camera techniques such as montage to parallel the on screen narrative). Firstly to create the complex and materialistic Kane, Welles puts in a first class performance a seasoned actor would be proud of. Since this was Welles' first feature film, its even more astonishing that his input stemmed top to bottom and worked to such perfection. With all this in mind it's understandable a young up and coming filmmaker would want to be expressive in his work, but its unbelievable that all works to such accord. But as stated, its the cinematic techniques and the little things we ordinarily don't place emphasis or attention to that impress.The use of extreme camera angles is noteworthy in symbolising the sway of power in exchanges; Kane is occasionally framed from extreme angles- low visually making him overpowering and mirroring the on screen events. Aside from this the use of shadow and chiaroscuro lighting parallel the on screen narration, e.g the enigmatic Kane is often filmed in shadow symbolic of the private and emotionally detached Kanes dark persona and the enigma behind 'rosebud'.Setting is another important tool in conveying a story and Citizen Kane not only showcases the perfect settings but its inventive camera-work perfectly complements the environments to maximise their effectiveness. A good example of this is in showing Kane standing at a window when his adoptive father speaks with him. The window appears overpowering next to the minute Kane in the distance, but with just a few steps forward Kane appears overpowering to the camera framing as he speaks of his own vision for building an empire. All appear irrelevant and you may read and think I'm reading too much into these little bouts of symbolism and visual parallelling narrative in aiding the story but one thing is for certain is that these are no accidents and are absolutely deliberate.A little about the story. Charles Foster Kane is dying and his last word uttered is 'rosebud'. Immediately the press attempt to uncover the significance of this and a reporter is sent to interview the nearest and dearest to Kane throughout different periods of his life. The narrative unfolds from the non linear technique of flashbacks and the use of montage is deployed in conveying the jumps in time at different points. One of the most interesting concepts about telling the story in this method is that its more expansive in fleshing out the protagonist Kane; since each storyteller has a different perspective of their own on Kane, each contributes to humanising and dehumanising him accordingly.If I had to place this film into a particular Genre is would categorise it as drama, the transformation of Kane from youthful millionaire with good intentions to selfish materialistic recluse dramatic and extreme. To preach, the film takes a swipe at the rewards and benefits of capitalist America at the time, Kane quoting 'if i hadn't been rich, i might have been a great man'. Profound and innovative it is with money and power undoubtedly being the catalyst for Kanes unpleasant transformation.Supporting performances are all top notch from Everett Sloane, Joseph Cotton etc are the icing on the cake making this film near perfect in truth. I highly recommend giving this film a go, and cannot think of any reason to dislike the film. Even if this isn't your cup of tea, nobody can deny its creative flair, such was the innovation that it spawned a whole new genre in film noir.",10,1,3,23 June 2012
Rocky V," rocky returns to the streets!
","There is much pessimism surrounding this film...and i think its mainly because it doesn't show everything as rosy in the life of rocky balboa...the viewers of the previous 4 films were just so used to seeing rocky winning, they couldn't handle it when this film was released and slated it. However their criticism holds little ground in my opinion, Rocky 5 is an all round good film.The most notable difference is that the makers have decided to opt for something different this time. It would have been easy enough to just put rocky in the ring again for another 15 rounds against a different opponent,but they haven't which I'm all for because,i think if we're all honest, it was getting tedious. Rocky 3 and 4 epitomised the word 'cheesy'...they actually gave deeper meaning to the word. It was especially pitiful listening to the speech at the end of rocky 4, because it was trying to hard and failing to include deeper morals within the script (if you remember the word 'change' was used a lot.... blah blah).Rocky 5 however does have a solid script whether its everyones cup of tea or not. I think that had rocky 5 been a completely independent movie and the previous 4 were not made, it would have had rave reviews. Rocky 5 gives us character development that no other rocky film does (aside from rocky 1 which Adrien is the main source). Tommy Gunn changes a great deal throughout the film (at first hes a young talent who idolises rocky, and slowly is manipulated by a boxing promoter, and becomes jealous of rocky). I think this development shows the script has had thought put into it.Another main criticism put forth by fans of rocky is that Rocky's trainer isn't in the film for more than five minutes at the beginning. Yes he isn't in the film long, but this also works out for the best. It would have been ludicrous to have had him come live with rocky or something while hes bankrupt.Overall rocky 5 is a good film that should be given a chance, albeit Rocky's 1 and 2 are still the most superior made.",7,3,3,9 October 2008
Fast & Furious 6," Noticeably Sillier
","Firstly I'll state by saying fast and furious is my favourite in the series. Having fallen off the franchise for a bit I picked up years later and found that although there were some over the top sequences, the film felt more grounded, took its time to build up, and the motivations of each character made sense. Sadly, I can't say the same here. The film starts with the scene of a robbery and some hammy dialogue from the Rock who rolls off his partners CV rather than simply say hello like a normal person. After this it's declared there's a surviving witness who the rock proceeds to beat the hell out of with no consequences, all the while it shot as a bit of a joke. It was at this point I knew the tone of the film was going to be a problem.So a little bit of a retcon takes place revealing lettie is alive to give Dom some much needed reason to come out of retirement and in fairness, what else were they going to do at this point? What bothered me is the ease in which Dom is tracked down by Hobbs and the inexcusable logic of Paul Walker; a new father feeling compelled to join in risking his life for the ride. He's actually egged on by his wife (girlfriend, I duno) and really does stretch my patience.So the film gets going and familiar tropes of tracking people through vehicle mods all crop up again. The banters largely fun between the team as it was in the last film but I can't help but find the moments of silliness (the rocks dive from a freeway onto a vehicle roof) grate on me a little too much. My score usually is 6/10 if decent and 7/10 if solid.... But if this film was on TV I'd probably skip next time. So with that in mind I'm giving this a 5/10.",5,0,0,1 June 2020
The Bourne Identity," Bourne beats bond
","i love the James bond franchise but the Bourne identity for me was the start of a superior franchise. The only problem is the plot of the Bourne films isn't everlasting id say...he cant remember who he is...yeah but thats not going to carry 21 or so films like bond...James bond has left more paths open shall we say. That said, less is better. The fact that there probably wont be so much more than 4 Bourne films will mean that there's less room for error. Call this the Fawlty towers method if you will. Only 12 made, but each superb.The Bourne identity, supremacy and ultimatum are closest in retrospect to the world is not enough,die another day, and casino Royal, in terms of release dates. I cant be bothered to go into real nitty gritty details about performances and character development and action sequences because I'm lazy and Matt Damon's always top class. All i'll say is see for yourself if you watch them, the pros and cons. Heres a gauge of how good the films are if you chose bond over Bourne in the years released.the world is not enough 6/10 the Bourne identity 8/10 die another day 6/10 the Bourne supremacy 8/10 Casino Royale 7/10 the Bourne ultimatum 9/10",8,2,2,18 January 2009
Pulp Fiction," The most interactive film around!!!
","As Tarantino states, its not confusing. You have to watch it but thats all he asks. And if you do you'll become embroiled with the most self reflexive film around. Cluttered with inter textual references to pop culture e.g pilots,Marilyn Monroe,Fonzie etc Tarantinos sublimely definitive post modern film highlights its artifice and as such we are suckered in.While the prudish may squirm at a 'immature celebration of violence' I personally applaud the profound approach of Tarantino presenting us with such outlandishly gruesome violence (pieces of brain etc) that we can do nothing but laugh. And for that reason. It's not realism. Nor does it try to be. On the contrary the surreal is celebrated here. You need only watch the scene involving Butch's selection of weapons in a standard corner store (a hammer, a chainsaw, a samurai sword) to realise Tarantino's playful homage to some of his favourite genres isn't halted by a reductive realist approach.While the narrative is a little disorientating on times, the beauty of it is that the audience become involved in the film more-so; it's their task to piece everything together. An interactive movie if you will. Tarantino being a film buff clutters his film with homage to some of his favourites. The dancing sequence involving Travolta evokes such nostalgia among movie fans for his roles in Greace and Saturday Night Fever, though is originally a nod to Jean Luc Godard for his approach of just stopping the film in full flow for a musical sequence. The briefcase with the light inside echos that of Kiss Me Deadly; a classical noir while Walkens tale regarding the watch mirrors the character from The Deer Hunter who was captured in Vietnam.On to performance. Travolta an unlikely choice at the time people forget does wonderfully well as our on screen stand in. He's constantly behind what's happening (the motif of events changing dramatically with every visit Vincent makes to the toilet is one often mentioned)and plays catch up alongside us since the narrative is so ridiculously spontaneous spinning off in unexpected directions(who on earth would have seen a rape scene ensue from Butch and Marcellus storyline, or Mias unexpected O.D- that wasn't on the cards was it). Jackson is the man as always playing Mr Cool here perfectly and Willis already a household name by this point brings credibility to the film, all the same his segment of the film is my least favourite. Possibly because of the playful immature banter between the two supposedly professional hit-man is just too funny. I just love the fact that in Tarantinos world, two dangerous murderers are brought down to bickering school children, scared to death of the thought of Jimmys wife arriving home. Not of the police, but of Jimmys wife. Surreal, but thats the beauty of this film. Simply has to be watched. One of the best films you'll see. I love Inglorious Basterds but i cant decide whether it tops Pulp Fiction. Either way both are amazing. Watch this film.",9,1,3,8 November 2012
The Matrix Reloaded," I understand completely....NOT
","Right so the first matrix film is a memorable film with terrific action sequences, and an innovative idea for a plot, which although is complicated, we're given time to digest it all. This follow up is the closest thing to school on film. To call this film confusing is an understatement.Whats new then in reloaded? Neo can fly! Stupidest thing in the film! Admitedly the ending to the first film, i have a major bone to pick with. If you've seen the matrix then youl know he got shot and got up and sorted some agents out. Problem is, im not the slightest bit concerned for neo now, because if being shot is no danger to him, then he technically cant die. So the beefed up action sequences are an opportunity to show off some cool animation (or whatever you wana call it). So neos portrayed as infallible because he can do whatever he wants.Agent smith isn't dead! If you liked him in the first film then good for you. Problem is, he doesn't in the slightest explain how hes not dead, and the audience watch as he clones himself in the matrix, with bewilderment. He has hundreds of people cloned to him, and what this means is they become him outside the matrix as well. Id love to sit down with the wachowski bros and ask them to explain stuff to me. I bet they don't have answers. SERIOUSLY! If ever when shooting keanu reeves had any queries about why certain things are so in the film they probably said something like 'thats just how it is' to him Next up we have the architect. Go get a snack when hes introduced to you. He talks constant garbage, and for the best part of two hours this is built as the supposed climax to the film where we get some answers and mission accomplished. Instead he explains the square root of pi cubed x the perpendicular angle of elevation on a right angled triangle. When he does decide to speak English, he gives neo a choice. Save trinity and let zion be destroyed,or save zion and find another shagging partner. So he does what any person would do if given the choice, stuff the lads in zion, one persons more important. Neos gone in the book as the most confused character ever to grace film. He looks clueless right the way through all three films, but even he could surely have noticed that if zions destroyed then so his he anyway. Or as good as anyways.SO after being given the choice. We discover that yet again in the matrix, action does not nessasarily trigger any consequences, because he saves trinity with no consequence. Zion isn't blown to pieces there and then. Neo has his cake, and eats it. How is trinity saved. Well she dies, but neo puts his hand in her, and all is well again. Why not just do this to everyone that dies then? The french guy they go to visit for the key maker, is there to use big words, and then say no. The meeting with him is just pointless. Overall i have to be honest, this film is awful. A nice action sequence on the freeway, is the highlight. Don't bother though.",7,1,2,1 February 2009
Downfall," Downfall- The most comprehensive study of Hitlers final days
","Whatever your opinion is of this movie, nobody can deny to create a film with Adolf Hitler the protagonist is a largely transgressive concept. With such a brave approach comes the degree of fictitiousness involved with the films narrative. Since very little is known of the events to occur within Hitlers bunker director Oliver Hirschbiegel has the task of piecing together what little is known with his own vision of Hitlers final days.To start the film offers an array of impressive performances; Bruno Ganz's erratic Hitler perfectly transcends the mere perceptions a perspective audience has when watching the film. He really is awesome. And in honesty he has to be; the basis for the films credibility lay solely on Ganz's performance, but thankfully he delivers to thundering applause. Taboo it may seem humanising somebody whose actions are distinctively 'inhuman', it's still the most accurate portrayal to date; Robert Carlyles overzealous effort, decent but not believable due to farcical overacting.For the supporting cast Traudl Junge, the secretary to Hitler is indeed portrayed inaccurately as a more virtuous, innocent and sweet young girl which sparks criticism from among those educated toward Nazi Germany. However the important motif of innocence is resonant throughout the entire film; children are left to defend Berlin (ignorent to the knowledge they haven't a chance of survival), and the innocents of Germany ultimately are left to face the consequences of the previous generations wrongdoings, while the real perpetrators cop out through suicide and hiding. Though the anti semitism of German society and atrocities perpetrated by the Germans during the war aren't as comprehensively addressed as say Schindler's List its important to address this film for what it is; the story of Hitler and national socialism's final days.Well documented is propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' murder of their children inside Hitler's bunker and this is one of the more uncomfortable scenes of the film, reinforcing the theme of the innocents paying the price. Goebbels and his wife's suicides bear resonance to the status quo sentiment felt by all Germans at this dreadful period; there is no life beyond national socialism.To categorise this film into a genre is a tough task but i'd call it a drama more than anything with action sequences sparsely present. Sounds good on paper right? Well i'll try to place a balanced viewpoint in reviewing this film so lets address the reasons perhaps the film may be limited or perhaps just not for you.1. To somebody perhaps not a keen enthusiast of History the lengthy scenes and claustrophobic feel of the film (with very few settings) this film may feel a bit of a drag at times. You may however find learning a little is beneficial.2. To somebody overly educated in Nazi Germany the few historical inaccuracies may just be too much to overlook.3. As my brother put it upon entering my bedroom and witnessing me watching Downfall, 'Why are you watching that for, its not in English'. An extremely fickle criticism in my eyes but subtitles aren't for everybody.Overall despite this hugely pessimistic outlook on a topic widely controversial, anybody even remotely into films should watch this. Even if you're not a WW2 buff or dislike drama, this film's narrative is largely unrivalled in content, making it by and large a unique film i would recommend to anybody. 8/9-10.",9,2,4,20 June 2012
Toy Story 3," Being 20 now....i have to say...this films for my age more!
","When my dad took me and my older brother to see toy story in cinema in 1995, i was only 6 years old and little did i know at the time, i was witnessing the beginning of perhaps the greatest film trilogy of all time. Toy Story captured the imagination and was the perfect family film combining adult (hey ham look i'm picasso....what 6 year old knows picasso) and child-like humour which made it a must see for parents and their children. One of the great things about the toys was how the characters all demonstrate human emotions giving the audience more empathy for them. One things for certain. PIXAR will eventually make a bad film, because its impossible that everything they produce is a masterpiece (although thus far they have done so). This film is their absolute pinnacle. The next film may be excellent, but it can not top this. The film is set around the toys being taken to a daycare centre before Andy's moving on to college. Shortly after arriving it seems the toys have landed on their feet and are set to be more loved and used than ever before. All is not what it seems though and the toys are soon plotting on busting out and getting woody back to Andy before he departs to college. Animation- Outstanding as ever Voice acting- Top class Direction- A joy to beholdEverybody on earth has a companion that they feel truly loved by. To Woody, Andy is this and his unwillingness to accept Andy having grown up is saddening to the audience watching. Anyone whose watched toy story 2 will understand Woody is now in Jessie's position shown in the montage. The obvious theme in this movie is growing up and moving on, but having seen the ending, id say woody's choice of jumping in the box with buzz and the rest, signals to people that there are people we love and inevitably have to let go, but your friends will always be there with you. This film had the perfect ending with a healthy message to its viewers. The guys at PIXAR are philosophers on life really aren't they.Up until 3 days ago i had lord of the rings and indiana jones as the pinnacle of film trilogies (not including Indy 4) but i'll have to rethink things now. Outstanding film from pixar but truth be told i was expecting nothing less. 9/10...No more now though....3 is enough",9,1,2,23 July 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," 7.5 or something on here.Im really not seeing it
","Why didn't i like this film. I think its an accumulation of factors. To start with the plot just didn't seem very 'Die Hard'. Secondly the story of John McClane in my eyes had run its course and to bring him back again to me was just farcical. I think the original appeal with the character was that while Stallone and Arnie were constantly producing action films with surreal characters that were so hyper masculine it seemed cheesy and well...just not believable, Die hard offered something different. The character of McClane is the everyday cop who happens to have just been caught up in the middle of a mess and feels obliged as a policeman to sort it out. McClane appeals because he's realistic.Granted with two more instalments it seemed unlikely of wrong place at wrong time would strike again which it did in Die Hard 2 (kind of why die hard 2 isn't really great either in my book), but with Die hard with a vengeance being about revenge i also accepted this. To become embroiled again just isn't believable.Moving back to my point of Die Hard being realistic in comparison to Rambo, whose destruction of a hundred soldiers with a machine gun single handedly is farcical, Die Hard 4.0 (why not just 4...why the point O at the end. 4.0 is 4...lord knows. This annoys me) demonstrates McClane taking out a helicopter with a car (at will mind...he could do this a hundred times and in his sleep) and muttering 'i was out of bullets' as though its no big deal. I've seen this film once and as i sit here writing this review i think it was around 2 years ago, maybe longer, but from what i can remember; Die Hard 4.0 (remember when they release die hard 5 now, they have to put the point 0 at the end so that it makes sense and is avant garde)...Not for me thanks.",5,1,3,27 January 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Immensely good conclusion
","Having re-watched this on the sofa just the other day i might have been forgiven for thinking my father would perhaps with nothing else to do, sit down and watch it with me and see if he became hooked. His gripe with the lord of the rings is 'its too much fantasy to the point where you can just make any old nonsense up'. I sort of see his point, since the army of the undead in this film was pushing it as far as what i was willing to accept was concerned. That said its possibly the only thing that tests my patience in this brilliant brilliant film. The pacing was perfect, the narrative flowed back and forth from each character so smoothly in the previous instalment that we sort of took it for granted here and knew what to expect. All the same kudos to Jackson for giving each character enough screen time for us to continue our emotional investment in them. As much as i loved the scenes with Aragon etc, the film is all about frodo and sam to me and i remember in the cinema just being on tender hooks wanting to see how gollums plan would unfold. I think it would have been cool to have a few extra scenes with frodo sam and gollum just showing how gollum is manipulating frodo against sam. Sam asks for the ring but there's no guarantee this would have happened. It would have been cool to see gollum putting sam up to it rather craftily beforehand. The acting is great and some of the playfulness that the previous instalment had going for it (mostly from Gimli) is not lost, despite a darker film all round. The effects as ever from weta are perfect. For anybody who hasn't seen this film, it's obviously part of a trilogy so don't watch it without having seen the other two. I recently watched the Hobbit and i just don't see it anywhere near the quality of these films. I really hate the obviousness of the CGI in it compared with these films and the fact that the plot feels little and not so important. To conclude my father didn't stay and watch the film having got bored, but still it was worth a go.",9,0,1,9 October 2013
Furious 7," More silliness
","Suffers from the same problem alot of action movies do nowadays. Illogical decisions like driving a car out of a building or tumbling down a cliff completely undermine any plays for tension. If our characters survive these things unharmed at the halfway point, it dilutes what everything follows means. If a car smashes into another I ask 'am i supposed to be concerned now for our superman protagonists'. Its just below par and I'm not having it! Fast and Furious (4) did things right! They've just gotten progressively sillier since.",5,0,0,6 June 2020
