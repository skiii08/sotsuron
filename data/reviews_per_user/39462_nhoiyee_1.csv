Blade Runner 2049," Nice visual but just plain boring
","I don't get the high rating. I tried to watch it to see if it's as good as I heard people say it is, and lost interest after giving it a generous 40 minutes. The visuals are beautiful so I will give it a 3, but it is all just effects, and add no value to the story, or do I find the any of the characters interesting. Ryan Gosling is bland to watch, not even handsome so no eye candy there. There is nothing worth watching at all.",3,2,4,30 December 2017
