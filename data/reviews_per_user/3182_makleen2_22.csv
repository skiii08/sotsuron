It," Classic Horror Reborn
","Seven pre-teen outcasts overcome their fears to confront a shape-shifting creature that takes the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown and awakens every 27 years to feed on children in It (2017), the latest film adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 novel of the same name.Written by Chase Palmer and Cary Fukunaga and directed by Andy Muschietti, It was filmed on a budget of $35 million and grossed over $117 million in its opening weekend. It revives classic American horror by delivering more than just jump scares. It was genuinely scary, but also at times heartfelt, funny, and sincere.It's success is even more surprising given its director's lack of experience. Andy Muschietti, an Argentine screenwriter, has only directed one other full-length feature. To entrust the long-anticipated reboot of one of Stephen King's most iconic horror tales to an inexperienced director is, well, incredible. That he actually pulled off making It into a blockbuster will ensure a long career. It's opening box office earnings completely eclipse The Sixth Sense's and that film made director M. Night Shyamalan a household name.I'm not a Stephen King fan and I don't get the fascination with clowns. I never read the novel or saw the 1990 TV mini series staring Tim Curry, so I came to the theater without any preconceptions aside from bits and pieces of things I've heard about It over the years. Like most Stephen King novels, the horror element is a vehicle for exploring other issues, issues related to family, coming of age, bullying, confronting mortality, etc., all of which appear in this story.It's those other elements that make this film so good. A great horror film doesn't just scare the audience. If you take the scary clown out of It, it's still a compelling movie. The characters learn to deal with fears, bullies, rejection, first love, flawed adults, and most importantly learn to rely on each other to confront the ugly side of life. Pennywise the Clown is just a personification of adolescent anxieties. So many contemporary horror film makers forget this.Unlike the book and miniseries (which open in 1957 and 1960), this film was set in 1989, so it does capitalize on '80s nostalgia, but It doesn't bash you over the head with it. The 1980s references are purposeful. In one scene, there are posters advertising A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child, which came out in 1989. I thought it was fitting to make reference to that franchise because many of the effects in It are reminiscent of A Nightmare on Elm Street, especially when the hair comes out of the sink and pulls Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis) toward the drain.It stumbles by introducing too many protagonists. I realize the film is just copying the number of characters in the book, but it's difficult to become attached to the characters when there are so many. There is William 'Bill' Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher), Benjamin 'Ben' Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Beverly 'Bev' Marsh, Richard 'Richie' Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Stanley 'Stan' Uris (Wyatt Oleff), Michael 'Mike' Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs), and Edward 'Eddie' Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer). Together, they form the 'Losers' Club,' who are terrorized by both Pennywise and the Bowers Gang.All the child actors in this movie are great. In a film that pits children against adults, the children are funny, relatable, and courageous, while the adults are creepy, sadistic, and often indifferent. But I can't help wondering if the movie would have been improved by condensing the group into three or four memorable characters. Are all seven really essential to the plot? Not really. Eddie, Stan, and Richie are basically the same person and play interchangeable roles.Thankfully, the film makers cut some of the more graphic scenes involving the preteen characters. Stephen King, who is truly a sick individual, included an orgy among the protagonists in his original book. I'm all for horror films shocking audiences and pushing the envelope, but this was intended to be a mainstream movie, not some back alley grindhouse flick. Audiences would have rightfully walked out of the theater in disgust.Overall, It (part one) is a great horror movie and a decent movie in general. After years of terrible American horror films, I hope the success of It inspires a more creative, intelligent approach to the genre.",9,2,3,2 October 2017
Detroit," A Gripping Historical Drama
","Detroit (2017), written by Mark Boal and directed by Kathryn Bigelow, dramatically recounts an incident in which three black men were allegedly murdered by police at the Algiers Motel during the 1967 Detroit Riot. Detroit grabs you and never lets go. Unfortunately, its subject matter might be a little too weighty for summer movie audiences. Bigelow, whose other films include The Hurt Locker (2008), K-19: The Widowmaker (2002), and Zero Dark Thirty (2012), set out to make a film critical of white privilege, so certain elements have been changed to conform to this perspective. In some ways the actual events were much worse than depicted.First, some context. In 1950, Detroit was a diverse, prosperous, and culturally significant metropolis of 1.85 million people. It was arguably among the greatest cities in the United States. By 1967, Detroit was 40 percent African American, but its police force was 95 percent white. Migration to the suburbs had already caused significant population decline. The 1967 Detroit Riot (also known as the 12th Street Riot) began around 3:15 a.m. Sunday, July 23, 1967, after police raided an illegal after hours party in the office of the United Community League for Civic Action at 9125 12th Street.The riot lasted five days, ending on July 27. Michigan Governor George W. Romney sent in the National Guard and President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions to help restore order. When the dust settled, 43 people were dead, 1,189 injured (including 493 police, firefighters, and National Guard members), and 7,231 arrested. 2,509 stores were looted or burned, with an economic loss estimated at $40 to $45 million.Three men, Aubrey Pollard (Nathan Davis Jr.), 19, Carl Cooper (Jason Mitchell), 17, and Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore), 18, were killed at an annex of the Algiers Motel, 8301 Woodward Avenue. Pollard was killed by Detroit Police Officer Ronald August ('Demens' – Jack Reynor), Temple was killed by Detroit Police Officer Robert Paille ('Flynn' – Ben O'Toole), and Cooper's murderer remains unknown. Police officers involved in the incident were acquitted by reason of self defense at trial, so their names were changed for the film.Two 18-year-old white women, Karen Malloy (Kaitlyn Dever) and Juli Hysell (Hannah Murray), were also present at the Algiers Motel that night. Detroit shows Officer Flynn accidentally tear off Juli's minidress just before releasing the two into National Guard custody. In reality, according to John Hersey, author of The Algiers Motel Incident (1968), police officers stripped both women naked and called them 'n----r lovers.' Filmmakers probably changed this scene in order to show Karen and Juli being given preferential treatment at the hands of white police officers.I was surprised to learn Patrolman Philip Krauss, played by Will Poulter, is a fictional 'amalgamate' character (based on several people). Poulter, who played Kenny Rossmore in We're the Millers (2013), disappears into this role. Everything from his hairstyle to his facial expressions makes him look like he stepped off the pages of a mid-20th century yearbook, as if the bully from A Christmas Story (1983) grew up and became a racist cop. Chilling.Powerful images dominate the film. When a security guard named Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega) is taken into an interrogation room, you can see a handcuff dangling from a pipe and a discolored stain on the wall at the same level as his head. The movie doesn't have to show violent interrogations took place–all it needs is this one brutal image. Boyega has been criticized as playing a flat, emotionless character, but I think Melvin was just a good guy trying to survive an incredibly dangerous situation. Real-life Melvin Dismukes told Variety the movie is 99.5 percent accurate according to his recollection.While the filmmaking here is masterful, its message is less encouraging. At the end, Detroit reinforces the negative stereotype that being successful is somehow less authentic for African Americans. After the incident at the motel, Larry Reed (Algee Smith), member of soul music group The Dramatics, leaves the band after refusing to perform for white audiences (the United States was 88 percent white in 1967). Instead, he finds solace in performing worship music at a local all-black church. While there's nothing wrong with community and religious service, it hints the answer to Detroit's racial animosity is to withdraw further into racially segregated communities. We all know the tragic end of that story.Despite some creative license with characters, events, and dialog, Detroit feels authentic. The settings, dress, and documentary style transport you back to that time, and not in a clichéd, feel-good way. Although Detroit doesn't disguise its message, it isn't entirely one-sided, showing the destructiveness of the mob and the efforts of some white policemen and authority figures try to combat the excesses of racist officers. It's by far the best historic drama of 2017.",9,6,18,7 August 2017
Wind River," Wind River is gritty, dark, and depressing, but that does not make it great
","A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker and an FBI agent team up to solve a double homicide on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming in Wind River (2017). On a mission to hunt down mountain lions killing local cattle, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) discovers the body of 18-year-old Natalie Hanson (Kelsey Asbille). The FBI sends Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), a Nevada field agent, to determine whether a crime has been committed. They later find another body, deepening the mystery.Wind River is writer-director Taylor Sheridan's latest offering. Sheridan is known for writing Hell or High Water (2016) and Sicario (2015) and acting in a number of TV dramas. Wind River takes place in Wyoming in early spring and has a very Western feel, despite its snow-swept mountains. Stunning cinematography was not enough to make up for extremely slow pacing and lack of compelling story.Some critics argue it is genre defying and highly original; I say it suffers from an identity crisis. Wind River is labeled a 'murder mystery thriller film,' but isn't either of those things. There's no mystery because a flashback explains exactly what happened halfway through and the authorities never actually solve the crime or bring anyone to justice. It's not a thriller because there's no sense of suspense or urgency. Unlike a typical crime thriller, there's no sense that one crime must be solved to prevent another from occurring.Unforgiven (1992) was genre defying and highly original. It had a compelling story and memorable characters with discernible personalities, it intermixed moments of humor and tenderness with shocking violence, and it shattered the mythos of the Old West while reigniting interest in the Western genre. In comparison, Wind River struggles to find direction. Its protagonists are cold and impenetrable and its interchangeable villains are uninteresting. Brooding, monotone delivery is mistaken for depth. Everyone is seriously depressed.Wind River's first act sets up an interesting premise. A Fish and Wildlife Service tracker with a tragic past must help a clueless FBI agent track down a human predator. Along the way, he finds love again and comes to accept the death of his own teenage daughter. That would have been a great movie.Unfortunately, that wasn't how this one played out. It turns out the double murder was incidental–a crime of passion. Everyone dies (including most of the police) before anyone can solve the crime, Cory Lambert doesn't end up with Jane Banner, and the final message seems to be 'life is really shitty in Wyoming.' Nothing changes except the number of headstones at the local cemetery.I did appreciate the characters' authenticity. The American Indians were actually played by actors and actresses of that ethnicity (mostly). Graham Greene, a Canadian Oneida Indian known for Dances with Wolves (1990) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), was great as Tribal Police Chief Ben. The settings were gritty and realistic, although one mobile home seemed to have an unrealistically cavernous interior.In the end, Wind River is gritty, dark, and depressing, but that does not make it great. Its promotional material boldly states: 'One of the best films of the year,' which while perhaps true, doesn't say much in comparison to the other films released in 2017.",6,3,7,2 October 2017
The Death of Stalin," Irreverent dramedy lampoons the Soviet Union
","Events surrounding the 1953 death of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin are recounted in The Death of Stalin (2017), a dark and irreverent dramedy written and directed by Armando Iannucci, et al. You'd be wrong if you thought there was nothing funny about a regime responsible for the deaths of 6 to 9 million people. This talented cast perfectly captures the chaotic and absurd at this pivotal moment in Russian history.Joseph Stalin, born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili, was a principal figure in the rise of communism in Russia and served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1952. He led the Soviet Union through World War 2, oversaw massive industrialization and collectivization programs, and instituted state terror to maintain control. After his death, his successors undertook reforms and denounced his crimes.The Death of Stalin depicts events from the night of Stalin's (Adrian McLoughlin) cerebral hemorrhage to Nikita Khrushchev's (Steve Buscemi) coup and the execution of NKVD (Soviet secret police) chief Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale). It portrays how paranoid and aware of their precarious position members of Stalin's inner circle were, and the struggle to find a leader among a group of frightened sycophants.Lavrentiy Beria was a truly monstrous figure. As soon as Stalin fell ill, he moved to eliminate his enemies and position himself as Stalin's successor, while currying favor with the public with a general amnesty for all prisoners. While the helpless and inept Georgy Malenkov (played brilliantly by Jeffrey Tambor) acted as Premier of the Soviet Union, his rivals fought behind the scenes to take control. They made a critical error by putting Nikita Khrushchev in charge of Stalin's funeral, where he was able to organize a coup with WW2 Soviet military hero Marshal Georgy Zhukov (Jason Isaacs).The Death of Stalin effectively blends comedy, farce, and drama. In one memorable scene, the amnesty order arrives while secret police are executing a line of prisoners. The executioner stops abruptly just before shooting the next man. We see the look of confusion, relief, and disbelief on the prisoner's face, and can only image how we would feel in that situation. Get that man an Oscar!While the film omits background information for the sake of brevity, it could have done a better job explaining some elements of the film, such as why Stalin's doctors were so mistreated. We see Stalin's advisors reluctantly recall a group of physicians to examine Stalin after his cerebral hemorrhage. Stalin's son and daughter berate them, while they are afraid to give a diagnosis.It's assumed they had been arrested for some unspecified political crime, but Stalin's hatred and mistrust of doctors was specifically a result of the 'Doctors' Plot' a year earlier, when he accused several Kremlin doctors of allegedly plotting to kill him and put them under arrest. It's not a critical oversight, but knowing that background adds to the film's authenticity.The Russian government predictably hated this film, and revoked its distribution certificate. Russian deputies criticized it for making a mockery of Soviet history, called it 'disgusting,' and even accused it of mocking the victims of Stalinism. Is it okay to laugh at terrible or controversial historical events? How far removed from those events do you have to be to find humor in them?There is a long history of comedians lampooning dictators and dictatorships, using humor to reveal unpleasant truths. Charlie Chaplin released his satire of fascism The Great Dictator (1940) while half the world was at war with Nazi Germany and its allies. Mel Brooks made fun of Nazis and Adolf Hitler in The Producers (1967), only 22 years after Hitler's death and the end of World War 2. These films are widely considered to be cinema classics. The Death of Stalin fits perfectly with this tradition.",9,6,9,6 September 2018
The Other Boleyn Girl," A colorful attempt to breathe new life into a familiar story
","An all-star cast weaves a sixteenth-century soap opera in this colorful attempt to breathe new life into a familiar story. Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Justin Chadwick, The Other Boleyn Girl (2008) was based on a novel of the same name by Philippa Gregory. Billed as a scandalous portrayal of King Henry VIII's courtship and eventual marriage to Anne Boleyn, this film seems quaint by today's standards. Its release was timed to capitalize on Showtime's The Tudors (2007-2010), but lacked that show's outstanding performances.The film opens in Tudor England during the reign of King Henry VIII (Eric Bana). Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) and his brother-in-law Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) learn the King is unhappy with his wife, Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), who has not yet produced a male heir. They sense an opportunity to advance their social standing by installing one of Boleyn's daughters as the King's mistress. His daughter Mary (Scarlett Johansson) has already wed William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch), so they turn to Anne (Natalie Portman).Over the objections of his wife, Elizabeth Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas), Thomas invites the King to his estate to introduce him to Anne. Things get complicated when the King is injured in a hunting accident and he falls in love with Mary when she tends to his injury. Mary becomes the King's mistress, and Anne is exiled to France for trying to marry an earl without the King's knowledge.Anne returns from France a transformed woman, and despite Mary giving birth to a baby boy, she sets her sights on winning the King's affection and becoming Queen. It's an all-too-familiar story, which ends in an all-too-familiar way. Unfortunately, the filmmakers chose to continue the story past its logical conclusion, when Anne wins the rivalry with Mary for the King's affection.King Henry VIII ruled England from 1509 to 1547. He is known for severing the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church, and for having six wives, two of whom he had executed. Mary Boleyn was the King's mistress for a time, and is rumored to have bore two of his illegitimate children. She was married twice, the second time to a common soldier, and died estranged from her family.Anne Boleyn became Queen of England in 1533, however, her failure to produce a male heir led to her execution for treason and other trumped-up charges three years later. Henry and Anne's daughter, Elizabeth, became one of England's most renowned queens, who reigned for over 44 years.The Other Boleyn Girl follows the general outline of history but changes many details. King Henry VIII met both Mary and Anne Boleyn at court, not at their father's estate. Henry had been present at Mary's wedding. Mary was not an innocent maiden when they met, having already had an affair with the King of France, among others in the French court. In contrast, Anne was well-educated, intelligent, gracious, and politically astute, a far cry from the brash and boorish depiction in this film. The Tudors also unfairly portrayed Anne this way.Compared with The Tudors, the acting in The Other Boleyn Girl leaves much to be desired. Natalie Dormer played a much more convincing seductress than Natalie Portman. She oozed sexuality, confidence, and energy. Jonathan Rhys Meyers' portrayal of King Henry VIII makes Eric Bana's seem flaccid by comparison. Of course, The Tudors had more time to develop their relationship and keep building the suspense. That's why The Other Boleyn Girl should have ended when Anne became queen and devoted more time to the rivalry with her sister.The Other Boleyn Girl is the kind of romantic costume drama that critics generally dislike but that appeals to a certain audience (the word 'soap opera' comes to mind). It currently holds a 42% positive rating from critics and 62% audience favorability on RottenTomatoes. The film was commercially lukewarm as well, grossing $26.8 million on a $35 million budget. The filmmakers should have focused on what unique elements they brought to the story, rather than waste screen time rehashing what audiences have seen before.",6,0,0,7 January 2019
"I, Tonya"," '90s Nostalgia-Fueled Docudrama
","Turns out talent and hard work might not be enough to succeed in this faux-docudrama based on the life of former competitive figure skater Tonya Harding, I, Tonya (2017). Written by Steven Rogers and directed by Craig Gillespie, I, Tonya stars Margot Robbie in the titular role. The film re-creates interviews with the principal characters involved in a controversial attack on fellow figure skater Nancy Kerrigan in 1994.Gillespie is a veteran director with several films and television episodes under his belt, so it comes as no surprise I, Tonya is competently handled. Rogers is mainly known for writing romantic comedies, so this film is quite a departure from his usual repertoire. Like the directing, the writing is solid but the fact it's based on actual interviews and recordings probably made it easier.Tonya Maxene Harding (Margot Robbie) grew up in poverty in Portland, Oregon. Her overbearing mother, LaVona (Allison Janney), pressured her into ice skating at a young age, eventually taking her out of school to pursue a career in the sport. In 1991, she became the first woman to successfully execute two triple axels in a single competition. She married Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) as a teen and their relationship quickly became abusive. Meanwhile, Gillooly's friend, Shawn Eckhardt (Paul Walter Hauser), appointed himself as her unofficial body guard.Harding finished fourth in the 1992 Winter Olympics and went home to be a waitress, where Coach Diane Rawlinson (Julianne Nicholson) convinced her to begin training for the 1994 Winter Olympics. Gillooly, now her ex-husband, allegedly concocted a plan with Eckhardt to intimidate Harding's rival, Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver). Eckhardt hired two hapless thugs to smash Kerrigan's knee. The event became a media sensation, resulting in Harding being banned from competitive ice skating.I, Tonya says surprisingly little about Nancy Kerrigan, though roughly half the film is devoted to the assault and its aftermath, and attempts to portray Tonya Harding as just as much a victim. It goes to great lengths to contrast Harding's hard-scrabble persona and background with Kerrigan's 'girl-next door' image, suggesting the judges were biased against Harding because of her background. In real life, however, Nancy Kerrigan also grew up in poverty. Her father sometimes worked three jobs and drove a Zamboni at a local ice rink in exchange for her skating lessons.Toxic relationships in this film mean motivations are always suspect. The characters use and abuse each other in pursuit of their self interest, despite insisting they're acting selflessly or out of love. To add to this moral ambiguity, Tonya Harding's character tells the audience there is no 'truth,' only what's true for each individual. Only there was truth; Nancy Kerrigan really was assaulted with a baton. Shawn Eckhardt really was delusional and a pathological liar. There were consequences for these realities that Tonya Harding had to live with for the rest of her life.So there's constant tension between events re-created in the film and those that occurred in real life, something that characters call attention to by breaking the forth wall. This is a clever way to address a common problem with movies based on real people and events. Filmmakers frequently alter events or simply invent things in order to make a compelling story. I, Tonya tells its audience: this is true, according to a particular perspective.I, Tonya is a clever and creative take on an infamous incident from the 1990s. I doubt many people under the age of 25 have ever heard of Tonya Harding or Nancy Kerrigan, but for people alive at the time, this incident was almost as sensational as the OJ Simpson trial. Actress Margot Robbie, who also produced the film, continues to impress and will hopefully be involved in more creative projects like this.",8,0,0,29 March 2018
BlacKkKlansman," An Ahistorical Dark Comedy
","An African-American police detective in 1970s Colorado Springs fights for acceptance at work while infiltrating the local branch of the Ku Klux Klan with help from his Jewish partner. Will he win the affection of a Colorado College activist and foil the KKK's violent schemes? Starring John David Washington, Adam Driver, and Laura Harrier, BlacKkKlansman (2018) was written and directed by Spike Lee, et al. While entertaining, it jettisons historical accuracy to score contemporary political points.BlacKkKlansman was inspired by the book Black Klansman (2014) by Ron Stallworth. Stallworth was a police officer and detective in the Colorado Springs Police Department who in 1979 responded to an ad in the newspaper looking to start a local branch of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. With the help of a white officer posing as Stallworth at meetings, he successfully infiltrated the Klan for nine months. The Colorado Springs PD shut down the investigation after Stallworth was asked to lead the chapter, fearing word would get out that the police department had Klan affiliations.Aside from a few incidents, like Stallworth speaking to David Duke (Grand Wizard of the KKKK) and having his picture taken with him, that's where the comparison parts ways. It turns out 'based on a true story' is really 'inspired by true events.' The writers took many creative liberties to forward a cinematic narrative and spoon feed the audience an overtly political message.Attacks on the film's accuracy have come from many corners. Sorry to Bother You (2018) director Boots Riley criticized Spike Lee for allegedly ..er.. whitewashing Ron Stallworth, turning him into a hero and downplaying his infiltration of black student organizations. 'It's a made up story in which the false parts of it try to make a cop the protagonist in the fight against racial oppression,' he argued.For his part, Spike Lee shrugged off any criticism about the historical accuracy of the film. He told SFGate, 'There isn't a film that's been made in the history of cinema where there hasn't been some embellishment. The title doesn't say, 'This is based on a true story.' The title says, 'This is based on for real, for real s-.''The problem with the film's accuracy isn't related to its entertainment value. There are plenty of entertaining and well-made films loosely based on real events (like The Nice Guys). The question is how much revisionism can audiences tolerate at the service of an overtly political message? BlacKkKlansman could've simply been a dark comedy about a weird and incredible invent in the history of U.S. law enforcement. Instead, it tried to make clear cut parallels between historic racism in the U.S., modern hate groups, and the election of Donald Trump in 2016.If Spike Lee wanted to make a movie about racism in the 1970s and draw parallels to contemporary politics, why not dramatize the 1979 Greensboro massacre, in which KKK and American Nazi Party members killed five communist protesters? That parallels the 2017 riot in Charlottesville much more closely than anything that happened during Ron Stallworth's infiltration of the KKKK in Colorado Springs.Was Spike Lee just trying to make parallels between racism in the 1970s and racism in the 2010s? Because he does that. A lot. He beats the audience over the head with it. Or is he criticizing identity politics as a whole by making a side by side comparison of black power activists and white power activists?I got the impression the film's message was that standing around yelling at each other and threatening violence is not the way forward. At one point a jump cut shows both groups shouting their respective slogans ('black power!' and 'white power!'). This is contrasted with the main character's chummy relationship with coworkers of different backgrounds. It took the cooperation of all members of the police department to foil the KKK's plot and root out a racist cop in their midst. This message will likely resonate with mainstream audiences but annoy activists like Boots Riley.Overall, BlacKkKlansman had its moments but was a little too on the nose for my tastes. The acting among the lead cast was decent. John David Washington and Laura Harrier have some on-screen chemistry, but their relationship comes off as strictly Platonic. Topher Grace stole the show as race huckster David Duke. Steve Buscemi's brother, Michael, gives a surprise performance as Ron Stallworth's third wheel. I have a feeling who the viewer voted for in the 2016 presidential election will predict whether they like or hate this film.",6,5,9,20 August 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Martin McDonagh needs to write an ending to this otherwise stellar film
","A woman seeks justice for her daughter by battling indifference in a small Midwestern town in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), written and directed by Martin McDonagh. This dark dramedy was enormously successful, raking in over $157 million worldwide on a $15 million budget. It goes to show what can happen when first rate actors play well-written characters in a compelling storyline.Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) is a grieving mother whose teenage daughter, Angela (Kathryn Newton), was brutally raped and murdered. Local Police Chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) has yet to make an arrest after several months. Frustrated with lack of progress in the investigation, Mildred rents three abandoned billboards and posts: 'Raped While Dying', 'Still No Arrests?', and 'How Come, Chief Willoughby?'The billboards quickly divide the town. Chief Willoughby, while sympathetic, is suffering from terminal cancer and feels Mildred is unfairly targeting him. He fails to restrain an alcoholic and abusive police officer, Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), who retaliates against the billboard owner, Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones). Mildred is also under attack from her ex husband, Charlie (John Hawkes), another abusive alcoholic, who blames her for their daughter's death.Events quickly spiral out of control, but nothing is resolved in the end. Jason Dixon is the only character who grows or has a change of heart, which is usual because he's definitely not the protagonist. Mildred remains unnecessarily mean to everyone around her, including James (Peter Dinklage), who is just trying to show her some affection.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was 'inspired by true events' when Martin McDonagh drove past several similar billboards along Interstate 10 near Vidor, Texas, just outside Beaumont. In real life, it was a grieving father who put them there after his daughter was allegedly strangled by her husband. He blames local police for dropping the ball and never charging anyone for the crime.This is a sad commonality in the U.S. In 2015, NPR reported the average national clearance rate for homicide was 64.1 percent, down from 90 percent in 1960. 'Clearance' just means someone was arrested for the crime. Last year, Chicago's murder clearance rate was only 20 percent. At least 200,000 murders have gone unsolved since the 1960s.So Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri likely stuck a chord with friends and family of homicide victims, equally frustrated and wishing they could act out like Mildred Hayes. McDonagh created Mildred's character because he wanted a 'strong female' role, and he succeeded if by 'strong female' he meant 'raging psychopath'. During the course of the film, she tortures her dentist, firebombs a police station, and contemplates murdering a man because someone overheard part of a conversation.Although Mildred Hayes' revenge is not as extreme as perpetrated by characters in vigilante films like Death Wish (1974), The Brave One (2007), and Law Abiding Citizen (2009), she personifies our primal desire to inflict vengeance against those who wronged us. While, in real life, we have to wait for the justice system to take its course, we often wish we could just 'do something,' even if it's to rage at everyone around us.I wish Mildred's character wasn't so one-dimensional. I wish she came to terms with the fact her daughter's murder may never be solved, that she found forgiveness, made peace with her ex-husband, or started a new life with James-something that gives us a glimpse of hope for the future. Instead, it was like Martin McDonagh didn't know how to write an ending, so he just stopped filming. It was a very disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to an otherwise stellar film.",8,1,2,22 August 2018
The Lost City of Z," Somehow manages to make an incredible, real-life story boring
","Written and directed by James Gray, The Lost City of Z (2016) traces the life of British soldier and explorer Percy Fawcett. Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) is compelled to scour the Amazon for evidence of a lost civilization. Along the way, he'll repeatedly abandon his wife Nina (Sienna Miller) and his children and overcome resistance from skeptical colleagues, all to ultimately come up empty handed. It is based on a book of the same name by David Grann.I've been looking forward to seeing this film since its release, because it's one of those real life stories more incredible than fiction. Percy Fawcett's adventures inspired both Indiana Jones and Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Lost World (1912). Unfortunately, The Lost City of Z was less an adventure film and more a plodding, meandering biopic that never quite finds its footing.As the film opens, we see Percy Fawcett at the cusp of the British upper class. He is a major in the army, but has no medals; he goes on a hunt and kills the stag, but is not invited to dine on it. We see he's skilled, daring, and willing to take risks. However, this isn't quite an introduction.The filmmakers assume their audience already knows who Percy Fawcett is, but he is a relatively obscure historical figure, especially to American audiences. It's crucial to quickly establish the identity of the main character and why he is important. Otherwise, you lose the audience's attention.Thirteen minutes into the film, a plot finally appears. We learn Fawcett's father was a gambling drunkard, and he is told that if he completes his mission to map the Bolivian border it will redeem his family name.Fawcett discovers pottery deep in the Amazon, but on his return to England, Royal Geographical Society members are skeptical that South American natives are capable of producing such artifacts. He convinces a few members to accompany him on another expedition, which turns up nothing. Fawcett goes off to fight in World War One where he's wounded in a gas attack and later reconciles with his eldest son, Jack (Tom Holland).Jack convinces him to embark on one final expedition. We see them wander around the jungle for a while until they're captured by an Amazon tribe and drugged, leading to a pointless flashback / hallucination before the screen fades to black. Back home, many years later, Nina presents the president of the Royal Geographical Society a compass Percy said he would send home if he ever found the lost city.Historically, no one knows what happened to Percy and Jack Fawcett, who disappeared on May 29, 1925, but it's likely they were killed by hostile natives or succumbed to disease. Over the past several years, anthropologists have discovered concrete evidence of a lost civilization in the Amazon, near where Fawcett went missing.This film is more or less accurate, although it softens some of his unusual beliefs, including that the lost city of Z was an outpost for ancient extraterrestrial gods and a remnant of Atlantis. In one interesting scene, during the First World War, he's shown consulting with 'Madame Kumel' (Elena Solovey), a character based on psychic and occultist Madame Blavatsky. Although Fawcett was a devotee of Blavatsky's, she died in 1891.The Lost City of Z somehow manages to make an incredible, real-life story boring. It suffers from lack of direction and plods along unmercifully for 141 minutes. The film should have started right in the middle of the action, on Fawcett's last expedition. His personal history and previous expeditions could be retold through brief flashbacks. Instead, it takes so long to get to the point, then leaves audiences with a cheap teaser to make up for lack of a satisfactory conclusion. As a result, it bombed at the box office, grossing $8.57 million in U.S. sales off a $30 million budget. What a disappointment.",5,0,0,3 October 2017
Goon," A Heartfelt Sports Comedy
","A down-and-out bouncer discovers he has a talent for dolling out beatings in the hockey rink in Goon (2011), a surprising independent Canadian sports comedy film written by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg and directed by Michael Dowse. Aside from being well made, Goon features a solid, nuanced performance by Seann William Scott.Despite dismal box office returns, Goon is almost universally praised by critics. It currently has a rating of 82 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. I overlooked it many times, because although Seann William Scott has had funny side roles in some of my favorite comedies, I just couldn't imagine him as a leading man. I was so wrong. In Goon, Scott proves he is a competent actor capable of breaking out of the fratbro trope.Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott), a tough but polite simpleton, is working a dead end job as a bouncer. His friend, Pat (Jay Baruchel), hosts a public access hockey call-in show. One night at an Orangetown Assassins minor league game, Doug gets into a fight with a player and the Assassins coach invites him to join the team as their 'enforcer.' When his skills on the ice improve, he's recruited to play for the Halifax Highlanders and protect their star player, Xavier LaFlamme (Marc-André Grondin), who is slow to recover from a brutal knockdown.Along the way, he falls in love with Eva (Alison Pill), an adorkable hockey fan who sleeps around with hockey players, but is in a relationship, and discovers he might one day have to confront Ross 'the Boss' Rhea (Liev Schreiber), who was responsible for knocking out Xavier LaFlamme. Will he get the girl and defeat his rival? Seann William Scott is an American actor predominantly known for playing Steve Stifler in the American Pie films, as well as a host of other moronic, comic-relief roles. His portrayal of Doug in Goon reveals a nuanced side and shows he is maturing as an actor. I was impressed by this performance, and like Matthew McConaughey, who began his career as a stoner 'bro', as Scott gets older he may successfully transition to more dramatic roles.Alison Pill is a Canadian actress who played Kim Pine in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) and Maggie Jordan in the TV series The Newsroom (2012-2014), though she has been acting since childhood. Alison's character, Eva, is a subverted version of Adrian from Rocky. As Doug's love interest, Eva is not well-developed, which is a shame because even though their relationship is given plenty of screen time, she tends to fade into the background. We never learn much about her other than her passion for hockey and unfaithful promiscuity.Goon doesn't disguise its similarities with Rocky (1976), another film about a dimwitted but polite muscle who rises to prominence in a violent sport. Goon raises the violence in hockey to a level in which you almost forget the point of the game is to score goals. It focuses almost entirely on Doug's bouts with the other players, and the exaggerated level of brutality would be gratuitous if it wasn't so well-crafted.Goon shares similarities with other films as well. A scene in which Doug Glatt meets Ross Rhea in a diner is reminiscent of the famous restaurant scene in Heat (1995). These callbacks to famous films is probably why Goon is so good, since the filmmakers decided to replicate proved success. Unfortunately, either the subject matter doesn't really appeal to American audiences or the film wasn't properly advertised, and it was not commercially successful. A sequel, Goon: Last of the Enforcers, came out this year to mediocre reception.",8,0,0,25 November 2017
The Favourite," Sensationalism at the Expense of History
","The beautiful cinematography and wonderful acting in this over-the-top period piece barely makes up for its historical inaccuracy and a grueling 2-hour run time. Written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, The Favourite is artistically filmed, the acting is wonderful, and cinematography top notch. If you're looking for a realistic account of Queen Anne's 18th Century British court, however, you'll be sorely disappointed. The Favourite chooses to enshrine gossip and rumor as historic fact, while delivering a film that is as tedious as it is tantalizing.As the film opens, Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is deciding whether to continue a war with France after an English victory, or sue for peace. Her natural inclination, and that of opposition leader Robert Harley (Nicholas Hoult), is for peace, but her influential friend and Keeper of the Privy Purse Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz), wife of Lord Marlborough (Mark Gatiss), wants to prosecute the war to the bitter end. During negotiations, a dirty but charming Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives seeking employment in Lady Sarah's household.Things get complicated when Abigail discovers Queen Anne and Lady Sarah's dirty little secret, and uses it to her advantage to get closer to the Queen. Abigail and Lady Sarah engage in a private war for the Queen's affection, while Robert Harley and Samuel Masham (Joe Alwyn) conspire to use Abigail to get closer to the Queen, wh0 only has time for one friend, I guess. Who will become the Queen's favourite?Using extreme wide-angles (shot with Panavision lenses) to achieve a sense of expanse even in a small room, the filmmakers capture a delightfully Baroque portrayal of an outlandish and amoral British aristocracy. The acting is top-notch, with Emma Stone giving one of the best performances of her career. Olivia Colman should receive an Oscar nod for her portrayal of Queen Anne. The film, however, could've been improved by cutting at least 20 minutes of silence, screeching violins, and arthouse chapter titles.Historically, Queen Anne ruled England, Scotland, and Ireland (and then Great Britain) from 1702 to 1714. The film takes place during the War of the Spanish Succession. John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, the husband of Queen Anne's close friend, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, was commander of Allied forces in that conflict. Marlborough was caught between the two political parties in Britain: the Tories and Whigs. Queen Anne favored the Tories, who wanted peace, but the Whigs had gained considerable power alongside Sarah Churchill, who had the Queen's ear and advocated on their behalf.Sarah was notoriously headstrong and spoke her mind freely and openly, which began to get on the Queen's nerves. In 1711, Queen Anne dismissed the Duke of Marlborough from service over charges of embezzlement. John and Sarah Churchill went into exile a year later. Sarah's break with the Queen was exacerbated by her rivalry with her younger cousin, Abigail (Hill) Masham. Sarah tried to have Abigail removed from the Queen's household, and when she could not, accused Abigail and the religiously conservative Queen of having a sexual relationship (among a litany of other insults).The Favourite indulges in sensationalism at the expense of history. It depicts Sarah as a jealous lover carrying on an illicit sexual affair with the Queen and omits Queen Anne's great religious devotion and her marriage to Prince George of Denmark, though he died in 1708. The only evidence of a love affair comes from romantic-sounding (but entirely Platonic) letters and rumors spread by political rivals. Director Yorgos Lanthimos admitted he didn't care whether a real love triangle took place between Queen Anne, Sarah Churchill, and Abigail Masham. 'We never really discussed it (the historical accuracy),' he said.As a story of two rivals competing for the affections of a monarch, The Favourite is similar to The Other Boleyn Girl (2008), directed by Justin Chadwick and starring Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, and Eric Bana. It is about the rivalry between sisters Anne and Mary Boleyn for the affection of King Henry VIII. Sarah Churchill and Abigail Masham were also related (though distantly). It wasn't uncommon at the time for ambitious families to seek employment at a royal court, and becoming a royal mistress could be very advantageous.Like The Favourite, The Other Boleyn Girl has little regard for historic accuracy, but where The Favourite imagined sexual trysts where there probably were none, The Other Boleyn Girl turns the Boleyn sisters into innocent virgins. In that film, Anne is depicted as a pure and devoted wife when she met King Henry VIII. In reality, she had already been kicked out of the French Court for sleeping around (King Francis called her 'my English mare'). You know it's bad when even the French think your sex life is scandalous.The Favourite currently holds a 94% positive rating from critics and 58% audience favorability on RottenTomatoes. Despite winning a litany of praise and awards, it barely made back its $15 million budget at the box office. Why the discrepancy? This is exactly the type of film critics love, and it will appeal to art house aficionados. There's nothing wrong with that. But while general audiences might snicker at the absurd spectacle, they will feel the clock ticking on every single minute of this two-hour film.",7,2,4,3 January 2019
Get Out," An Honest Assessment of Get Out
","Written and directed by Jordan Peele of Key & Peele and MADtv, Get Out (2017) is the story of a young interracial couple, Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), meeting Rose's parents for the first time. By all appearances, Mr. and Mrs. Armitage (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) have no idea Chris is black. They seem to be friendly and progressive, if not awkward, but all is not what it seems.This is Peele's first film, and it has gotten nearly universally positive reviews, which I'll admit, perplexed me at first. When I saw the preview, I thought it was a joke, like the horror movie spoof 'Ghost Tits.' It looked like something from MADtv or The Chappelle Show, which makes sense since Jordan Peele is mostly known for sketch comedy. Critics said Get Out was 'the smartest horror movie in ages,' 'fresh and sharp,' and 'masterfully and subtly crafted.' I had to see if it lived up to the hype.Critics love to exaggerate positives and negatives, and there's definitely some of that going on with these reviews, but Get Out is a solid, well crafted horror film. The preview doesn't do it justice. The music, scares, characters, editing, foreshadowing, actors and actresses–all of it works.The characters are genuinely creepy. We've all walked into situations where we had to meet people for the first time and they were a little odd or off putting. Get Out ratchets up that feeling and adds a racial element into the mix to make it more believable. The audience second guesses themselves along with the main character. Is there something wrong with these folks, or is it just culture shock? Many critics have chosen to focus on racism or subtle racism as a theme in Get Out, but I think Peele is doing something more clever with this. It's nearly impossible to make a film without reflecting the society in which it was made or the values of the filmmakers. In that sense, yes, Get Out speaks to African Americans who experience this kind of subtle racism. And it's interesting because it's not a perspective you usually see in horror films. But most moviegoers are white. Does the white audience identify with the protagonist and his struggles to be accepted by his girlfriend's family? I'm guessing not.In my review of A Cure for Wellness (2016), I argued that in a good mystery, the audience discovers clues alongside the protagonist. The thrill comes from an 'ah-hah' moment, as the clues begin to fit together. The mystery in A Cure for Wellness didn't work because it was too obvious what was going on. It needed a red herring to keep the audience on its toes.In Get Out, racism is the red herring. Chris' friend Rod Williams (LilRel Howery), a TSA agent, basically gets at the truth long before anyone else, but his theory is so outlandish, you're predisposed to dismiss it out of hand. There's a great scene when Rod takes his theory to the police, and they laugh him out of the room. This sends a signal to the audience not to take it seriously, even after Chris disappears.The movie preview and opening scenes had me so fixated on race, I was sure the family had some secret racist past. Right up to the big reveal, I was convinced Chris would find a KKK hood, or old photos of Mr. and Mrs. Armitage at a Klan rally. I won't give anything away, but the ending comes as a complete surprise, and I think that's what delights audiences so much. The Sixth Sense (1999) is the last time I remember a horror movie beguiling audiences so well.Peele himself said, 'What I'm going for is more the human demon that is inherent in the way we interact Humanity is the monster in my films.' So maybe it is about more than race, although it's hard to find a horror film where humans aren't monsters in some way. Whatever his motive, Peele produced a fresh take on an otherwise warmed-over genre. I went into the movie with a skeptical eye, and came out a fan.",9,29,59,27 September 2017
War Machine," Hollywood can learn a thing or two from this Netflix production
","War Machine (2017) stars Brad Pitt as General Glen McMahon, a fictional commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2009. It is a savage parody of General Stanley McChrystal and the U.S. and Coalition War in Afghanistan, based on The Operators (2012) by Michael Hastings, a sleazy reporter for Rolling Stone and BuzzFeed. Hastings' hit piece on General McChrystal in Rolling Stone led to his resignation as Commander of the International Security Assistance Force and retirement from the Army in 2010.The film opens as hard-fighting General Glen McMahon arrives in Afghanistan to whip things into shape and finally win the war. The narrator tells us General McMahon is a soldier's soldier, a West Point and Ranger School graduate who eats once a day, gets four hours of sleep a night, and runs seven miles every morning.His staff includes a civilian press adviser, Matt Little (Topher Grace), X.O. Colonel Cory Staggart (John Magaro), Major General Greg Pulver (Anthony Michael Hall), 'tech whiz' Andy Moon (RJ Cyler), Navy Seal Major Pete Duckman (Anthony Hayes), Admiral Simon Ball (Daniel Betts), and Sergeant Willy Dunne (Emory Cohen). Together, they believe they can bring peace and stability to Afghanistan.General McMahon quickly learns he's up against some tougher opponents than the Taliban, including obstinate government officials, reluctant NATO allies, and a hostile press. Even U.S. soldiers, given voice by Marine Corporal Billy Cole (Lakeith Stanfield), are skeptical of their mission and its chances for success. McMahon must use unconventional tactics and the force of his personality to fully implement his grand plan for victory.In the military, commanders are given a high degree of discretion over their troops. They are accustomed to getting what they want and not hearing the word 'no.' Like Colonel Joshua Chamberlain says in the movie Gettysburg (1993), there's nothing so much like God on earth as a general on a battlefield. So it's easy to see how frustrated generals can be when constantly butting heads with civilian authorities who think they know the general's job better than he does. War Machine artfully and humorously depicts this situation.Every character in War Machine is portrayed authentically, and the actors and actresses perform marvelously. With a few lines, Ben Kingsley, who plays former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, perfectly captures the sardonic indifference of a powerless man supposedly holding a position of power.'I am behaving like a leader,' he tells McMahon after McMahon urges him to endorse his offensive in Helmand Province. 'I am as unavailable to you as your own president.' It's a particularly biting insult, considering how President Obama brushed off McMahon on the runway earlier in the film. Moments later, he says, 'You have my approval, general. We both know it was never really mine to give. But I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.' Meg Tilly gives another great performance as McMahon's wife, Jeannie, who has seen her husband less than 30 days a year for the past eight years. Practically strangers, the distance between them is palpable. Yet there is a genuine attempt to remain close and supportive. So many military spouses have gone through a similar experience, particularly at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. She puts a human face on the cost of General McMahon's drive to succeed.In the end, General McMahon flies off alone to meet the U.S. President and is forced to resign as a result of negative publicity from an article in Rolling Stone. A new team, led by a tough, hard-fighting general lands in Afghanistan to take his place.In less capable hands, War Machine had the potential to be another Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk (2016) or Lions for Lambs (2007), contemporary critiques of the War on Terror that just come across as rushed and ham-fisted. I haven't read The Operators, so I don't know how closely the film adheres to the book, but writer and director David Michôd nailed it as far as I'm concerned. Hollywood can learn a thing or two from this Netflix production.",9,8,16,28 September 2017
Snowden," A Masterfully-Crafted Fairytale
","Oliver Stone's latest film, Snowden, a biopic about NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden, is an effective piece of propaganda. It's nearly flawless as a film in terms of acting, editing, pacing, and dialog, but lacks the depth usually given to such a controversial subject.First, here's what Snowden gets right. Every actor and actress in this movie is on point. Every character feels genuine. Nicolas Cage, in top form, even makes a cameo as Hank Forrester, a (fictional) disillusioned CIA instructor. Shailene Woodley is perfect as Lindsay Mills, a free spirited, liberal photographer Snowden falls in love with.One of the advantages of portraying a living person is you are able to study their mannerisms, tone, and expressions. Joseph Gordon-Levitt studied his subject well. Levitt, as Snowden, narrates throughout the entire film, as he is telling his story to a group of journalists, but the dialog is tight and the narration never gets bogged down in needless exposition.Snowden is well-crafted. In one particularly memorable scene, Corbin O'Brian, Snowden's fictional CIA handler, takes Snowden hunting and they discuss his career's future. The natural scene, the birds, hounds, metal and wooden shotguns, a hunting lodge, are perfectly juxtaposed against their conversation about cyberspace, computer network defense, and foreign enemies.It was a conversation Oliver Stone could have easily set in a fast paced room with wires, computer monitors, servers, and shadowy figures typing furiously at keyboards, but instead he chose to ground these abstract concepts in a stark, low-tech, almost serene environment.The film's visual authenticity is also its greatest weakness: because Snowden is almost entirely fictional. It is a fairy tale meant to portray Edward Snowden as a reluctant hero who is compelled to speak out against an out-of-control national security state, explicitly compared in one scene with Nazi Germany.For me, the film raised red flags in the very beginning when in basic training Snowden calls his drill sergeant 'Sir.' Soldiers in the U.S. Army do not call drill sergeants 'Sir.' You may think this is nitpicking, but if Oliver Stone is willing to fudge this minor detail for the sake of convention, or because it's what the audience expects to hear, what other facts is he willing to fudge for the sake of the story? Quite a bit, as it turns out. Some characters and situations are simply made up. Oliver Stone portrays Snowden as a genius and a rising star in the intelligence community, which jives with his own inflated image of himself. Snowden reportedly lied on his resume, saying he attended Johns Hopkins University, a Tokyo campus of the University of Maryland, and the University of Liverpool in Britain.In fact, Johns Hopkins has no record of him attending classes there, he attended one summer semester at the University of Maryland, and registered for but did not attend classes at the University of Liverpool. This inflated sense of accomplishment is reflected in the film–not as a personality flaw, but as undisputed truth.Contrast Snowden with the 2013 thriller about Julian Assange and Wikileaks, The Fifth Estate, and this one-sided portrayal becomes even more obvious. The Fifth Estate portrayed Julian Assange as a complex figure–someone who believed he was acting for the greater good but whose personal flaws cast a shadow over his actions.Snowden only shows one side of the story–as told by Snowden himself. Therefore, the audience is never led to question Snowden's version of events. In my opinion, this takes away from what otherwise would be a compelling film about current events.",7,2,4,16 September 2017
The Disaster Artist," An Interesting Character Study
","James Franco directs and stars in this character study of filmmaker Tommy Wiseau, based on the book The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made (2014) by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell.The Disaster Artist (2017) traces the rise of mysterious and eccentric actor and filmmaker Tommy Wiseau and his tumultuous friendship with the much younger Greg Sestero. Wiseau and Greg meet in an acting class, where Greg is drawn to Wiseau's fearlessness and determination.The two decide to move to Los Angeles and pursue acting careers. While Greg is able to land a few bit roles, people are turned off by Wiseau's strange behavior, accent, and overconfidence. Frustrated by lack of forward momentum, Wiseau decides to write, produce, and direct his own film starring Greg and himself.The project begins with promise, but things quickly go south as it becomes apparent Wiseau has more confidence than skill or experience. He continually references Hollywood to justify his bizarre behavior ('we're making real Hollywood movie!') and refers back to other directors' outrageous behavior to excuse his own. Ironically, what he produces is so bad it goes down in history as one of the worst films ever made.I never watched The Room (2003), and I don't understand people's fascination with bad movies or why they become cult classics. I guess it's a way to live vicariously or somehow feel attached to something unique, similar to why reality TV is so popular.Although Wiseau's erstwhile friend, Greg Sestero (Dave Franco), is the film's protagonist, James Franco steals the show as Tommy Wiseau. Real-life brothers Greg and James Franco had genuine chemistry on screen, but James is clearly the stronger actor of the two and fully committed himself to the role.Wiseau is fascinating because he wants all the accolades of stardom and celebrity, without doing any of the work. He thinks he can simply buy his way into infamy, and he actually succeeds, though not in the way he intended.Much like the appeal of the film it's centered on, The Disaster Artist is really only interesting in the same way a car accident is interesting to passing motorists. The audience wants to see why the movie is so bad, and learn the secrets of its mysterious creator.The message of the movie is that entertaining people, even with a bad movie, is redeeming. Despite all the heartache, wasted time, and abuse, Wiseau was able to bring joy to his audience, and we want him to succeed because we all feel like the underdog and all have dreams of creating something other people will appreciate.",6,1,2,24 March 2018
The Witch," Wonderfully atmospheric and historically accurate take on witch mythology in colonial New England
","The Witch: A New-England Folktale (2015) is an entertaining, wonderfully atmospheric and historically accurate take on witch mythology in colonial New England. Plenty of films claim historic accuracy, but you rarely see it. Mel Gibson is notorious for his pseudo historical (but highly entertaining) historical fiction movies. The Witch, though a semi-low budget horror film, puts those to shame. Listen to what the director says about his attention to detail.'I am positive it is the most accurate portrayal of this period in American history on screen. We went to such lengths to make it so,' writer-director Robert Eggers told the LA Times earlier this year. 'Everything with the farmstead that we built, everything that you see on-screen is made from the correct building materials that would have been used at the time. Most often we used the traditional tools and techniques to create these objects. And the clothing is hand stitched based on extant clothing.' OK, except the nails, which are round and not square like they would have been in the seventeenth century.Nitpickers have also gone after the filmmaker's stylized title. Cinema Sins' claim that the digraph 'VV' fell out of use after the sixteenth century (The Witch is set in the seventeenth century), and therefore the stylized use of VV in the title is inaccurate, is only partly true.The Wonders of the Invisible World by Cotton Mather, published in 1693, clearly shows witch spelled with a digraph. However, it is a 'double U,' or UU. Several other pamphlets, shown here, from 1643 and 1645, both show witch spelled 'V Vitch,' just like the film title. Printing at the time was more art than science, and printers chose when to use the modern W or the older VV or UU.Even the witch lore is highly accurate to the seventeenth century, from using baby's blood as flying ointment, to enchanted animals cursing weapons in order to slip away unharmed. And, of course, writing one's name in blood in the Devil's book, creepily portrayed by a black goat. Witches were believed to cause their victims to vomit foreign objects, shown when the family's son, Caleb is being tormented and spits up an apple. There are no magic wands, pointy hats, or broomsticks here.Witches represented a malevolent force in the natural and social order, destroying relationships between neighbors and family members. In The Witch, tragedies and minor transgressions gradually unravel the family and undermine the trust that held them together. The tension is palpable as they slowly turn on each other, all while apparently under supernatural assault. The terror comes from knowing this threat destroys from within as well as from without.In many ways The Witch reminds me of Eyes of Fire (1983), in which a group of religious dissenters flee to the wilderness only to face assault by supernatural forces in colonial New England. There's something primordial about the hostility of nature, survival, and the union of wood and spirit. The idea that nature is foreign and hostile to man appeals to our basest instincts.I'm not sure I'd agree with Jay from RedLetterMedia that The Witch is the best film to hit theaters in 2016, but it's definitely the best horror movie to come out for a while. It's an incredible first film for writer-director Robert Eggers. I just hope he isn't another M. Night Shyamalan, whose breakout film The Sixth Sense revolutionized the genre, but he went on to make complete garbage for the rest of his career.",10,18,37,20 September 2017
12 Strong," Exciting but Embellished Portrayal of Operation Enduring Freedom's Opening Salvo
","Twelve special operations soldiers team up with the Northern Alliance to strike back against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in 12 Strong (2018). Written by Ted Tally and Peter Craig, and directed by Nicolai Fuglsig, 12 Strong is based on the book Horse Soldiers (2009) by Doug Stanton. Unfortunately, epic battle scenes and a compelling real-life story aren't enough to rescue this film from its lackluster execution and direction.Green Beret Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) is moving to a staff job when terrorists destroy the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. With the help of Chief Warrant Officer 5 Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon), he convinces Lt. Colonel Max Bowers (Rob Riggle), Commander of 3rd Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group, to allow him to rejoin his team and deploy with Task Force Dagger against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.In Uzbekistan, Captain Nelson convinces Colonel John Mulholland (William Fichtner) to allow his team to go in first by displaying confidence and a knowledge of Afghan history, despite never having served in combat. Prominent members of his team include SFC Sam Diller (Michael Peña) and SFC Ben Milo (Trevante Rhodes). Together, they must earn the trust of an unpredictable Afghan warlord, General Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban), and help him defeat his Taliban rivals around the city of Mazar-i-Sharif using U.S. air power.Mullah Razzan (Numan Acar), leader of the Taliban forces, is a dark-haired, mustache-twirling villain who executes a woman early in the film for teaching young girls to read. After several confrontations and missteps, Captain Nelson wins Dostum's trust and together they overwhelm the Taliban in the 'Tiangi Gap' and free Mazar-i-Sharif, mostly on horseback.This is Danish photojournalist and director Nicolai Fuglsig's sophomore effort, his first being a sci fi film he wrote, produced, and directed called Exfil (2017). A more experienced director probably could have crafted this story into something a bit more substantive. It falls victim to the same arcade-style action we've come to expect, and unnecessarily embellishes the truth to make events seem more incredible.I was disappointed to learn the events of the climactic battle are almost entirely made up. Real-life Capt. Mark Nutsch (Mitch Nelson in the film) told the Tampa Bay Times, 'This is a fictional portrayal - don't lose sight of that.' U.S. Green Berets didn't charge into the fight-they directed airstrikes from overwatches behind the frontlines.In real life, it took roughly nine hours for help to arrive, and this is explicitly stated several times in 12 Strong. However, when Hal Spencer is severely wounded in a suicide-grenade attack, a helicopter arrives within minutes after the battle to evacuate him to safety. That's because the incident is included for dramatic effect, and none of the team members were actually wounded.The climactic charge of the horse soldiers against two BM-21 'Grad' multiple rocket launchers also never happened. While the Taliban did have BM-21s at the Battle of Mazar-i-Sharif, they were destroyed by U.S. airstrikes. Still, seeing the rockets fire on screen was spectacular and an awesome visual effect.Overall, audiences generally liked this film, while critics gave it a lukewarm reception (72% versus 54% on Rotten Tomatoes). It delivers on the action and drama, and even attempts a nuanced portrayal of U.S.-Afghan relations, but something misfired along the way. 12 Strong ultimately comes across as formulaic and uninspiring, which is a shame because no Americans come closer to being real life heroes than these soldiers. They deserve a little better than a generic action film.",6,2,8,3 February 2018
Kong: Skull Island," A Monstrous Popcorn Flick
","Samuel L Jackson fights CGI monsters in this nostalgia-driven reboot of the 1933 classic King Kong. This is the third remake/reboot of King Kong. Though essential elements of the original remain, Kong: Skull Island (2017) is set in 1973, at the end of the Vietnam War. It is replete with counter-culture references and music from the period, with the addition of a marooned WW2 vet to appeal to Baby Boomers and their parents alike. Nostalgia is the only explanation I have for why this film has gotten such good reviews. The dialog, acting, plot, and CGI are all mediocre. Its only redeeming quality is the ending fight scene between Kong and a giant skullcrawler called Ramarak.The plot is straightforward. Bill Randa (John Goodman), a monster-hunter, attains funding to travel to an uncharted Pacific island under the guise of a geologic mapping expedition. He enlists the help of former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), and 'antiwar' photojournalist Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), alongside various Landsat employees.Once over the island, they encounter Kong, who smashes their helicopters. The survivors find a primitive tribe living on the island, alongside a stranded WW2 fighter pilot, Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly). From there, they must cross the island to safety while avoiding over-sized creatures and carnivorous skullcrawlers.While the 2005 Peter Jackson remake staring Jack Black wasn't great either, I preferred that version of Kong. He was essentially just a giant silver-back gorilla, with complex emotions and mannerisms copied from real life. In contrast, this Kong was as tall as a skyscraper, walked upright, and had two emotional states: pensive and roaring loudly. He's also somehow impervious to .30 cal machine gun bullets, fire, and razor-sharp teeth.1973 was an interesting setting for a Kong movie. In many ways this hearkens back to the 1976 remake, which also takes place in the '70s and features a helicopter battle with the monster. The settings, music, props, and cinematography all carefully reflect that period. In this time line, Bill Randa is eager to reach the island before newly launched U.S. satellites can map it, revealing its secrets. Randa sees President Richard Nixon announce troop withdrawal from Vietnam, and determines he must attain funding for his expedition before the war ends and Congress tightens its budget. Historically, the Earth Resources Technology Satellite was launched on July 23, 1972. It wasn't called Landsat until 1975–a minor discrepancy.Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard comes close to being the film's primary antagonist. As commander of an air cavalry squadron, the Sky Devils, Packard is the arch-typical 'warrior without a war.' 'We didn't lose the war,' he tells Mason Weaver, 'we abandoned it.' He relishes the chance to go on one final mission. When Kong ravages his squadron, destroys his helicopters, and kills his men, Packard becomes obsessed with revenge. He refuses to leave any man behind, taking his remaining troops on what seems like a suicide mission to recover Major Jack Chapman (Toby Kebbell). When Chapman dies, he persists with his determination to kill Kong.While Packard is supposed to the bad guy, he's the only character whose motivations make sense. After Hank Marlow explains Kong has been protecting the tribesmen from skullcrawlers, James Conrad tells Packard that Kong was 'just defending his territory' when he attacked their helicopters. Uh, OK? Unlike Conrad, who has no emotional ties to any other character, Packard has served with these men in war, presumably for years. He has an obligation to protect his men and recover them if they go missing. Can you blame him for being a little angry when he sees them butchered by a giant ape? Something else bothered me. Throughout the film, the main characters are covered in bile, muck, mud, dirt, blood, smoke, and scorched by flames, yet remain relatively unscathed. Mason Weaver and biologist San Lin (Tian Jing)'s hair and makeup are perfect. They also barely react to their environment. In one scene, they stumble on a boneyard with the skeletons of Kong's parents, killed by skullcrawlers. 'Do you smell that?' Marlow asks. 'That's death.' Yet no character reacts to the smell at all, probably because they're standing in front of a green screen. Later, Weaver and Conrad stand face-to-face with Kong, again with no reaction. I'm betting a giant gorilla that eats squid smells pretty bad. At least in the 1976 version, Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange's characters are dirty, wet, and their clothes are torn in the jungle.The movie credits photojournalists like Mason Weaver for ending the Vietnam War, using photographs of war's horrors to stoke antiwar sentiment back home. Likewise, Bill Randa hopes to use photography to prove the existence of monsters on Skull Island. On several occasions, the audience sees the exotic creatures and settings through Weaver's camera lens. In one scene, a skullcrawler swallows Randa and his camera. The camera flash reveals its location in the smoke to the other characters, allowing them to escape. I thought this theme, the power of cameras and photography, was one interesting aspect of this film.Overall, Kong: Skull Island wasn't as bad as its predecessors, but fell short in many critical areas. John C. Reilly, and Samuel L Jackson to some extent (in the vein of Snakes on a Plane and Deep Blue Sea), was there for comic relief, but the jokes fell flat. John Goodman is also traditionally a comedic actor, and Brie Larson is mostly known for playing Natalie 'Envy' Adams in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. So I wasn't sure whether this was supposed to be a campy, fun monster movie, a commentary on the Vietnam War, or an action-packed adventure film. Whatever it was supposed to be, it never rose above the level of a typical popcorn flick.",6,1,2,27 September 2017
Wonder Woman," A Dark Fantasy-Adventure
","Wonder Woman was written by Zack Snyder and Allan Heinberg and directed by Patty Jenkins. It stars Gal Gadot as Diana, Chris Pine as American spy Steve Trevor, and Danny Huston as General Ludendorff.Diana/Wonder Woman is a young, fearless woman with a mysterious destiny who lives on an idyllic island with fellow Amazon warriors. They spend their days preparing for a conflict with the Greek god of war, Ares. One day, a pilot (Steve Trevor) crash lands in the ocean and Diana saves him. The German Navy is in pursuit, and after a brief battle the Amazons defeat the German search party. Diana helps Trevor get off the island and return to 1918 Europe, where she thinks Ares has orchestrated the First World War.Wonder Woman is enjoyable and fast-paced. It's 141 minutes but never feels that long. The action is never exhausting until the end, when of course there has to be some apocalyptic battle between Wonder Woman and Ares. Through interacting with a cast of characters from 1918 Europe and America, Diana becomes disillusioned with humanity. In the end, Trevor's sacrifice to destroy a new poison gas developed by General Ludendorff's chemist, Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya), makes Diana realize humanity might be worth saving after all.The 'fish out of water' scenes are genuinely funny and charming. The interaction between Diana and Trevor is great, but you never really have a sense of them falling in love (they share an identical dance scene to the one between Peter Quill and Gamora in Guardians of the Galaxy to establish their chemistry). It's another 'two hot people hook up'-type of romance.When the Germans attack the island, it goes about how you would expect when people with modern rifles fight people with bows and arrows. Finally, I thought, a superhero movie that doesn't feel like you're watching a video game. My enthusiasm was short lived. Later in the movie, Wonder Woman plows through hundreds of faceless soldiers. In one scene, she throws a tank and the German soldiers keep fighting (what would you do if you saw someone throw a tank?)! I'm also uncomfortable with the way the filmmakers chose to make a historic figure, General Erich Ludendorff, a main antagonist. Ludendorff was 51 in 1916 when he became quartermaster general, overseeing the German war effort. After World War One, he became an advocate of Total War. While he was a hard man (even his wife described him as humorless), a conspiracy theorist, and authoritarian, he wasn't a cartoonish super villain. He's the only historical figure in the entire movie. I'm not sure what purpose his inclusion served when the filmmakers could have easily invented a fictional German general and no one would have noticed. It's not like a film about a comic book character needs some kind of historical validity.The plot involving the poison gas didn't make much sense. First, if its purpose was to make gas masks ineffective, why would the Germans test it on a village full of civilians? Second, what military purpose would it serve to aerial drop it over the frontline where it would kill both friendly and enemy troops? Why not load the gas onto artillery shells? A friend suggested this was something Ares whispered into Ludendorff's ear because his goal was to kill off humanity, which is plausible I guess.Finally, the movie undermines its own message. Wonder Woman wants to stop Ares because without war, the world will be a paradise. Ares' follower, Ludendorff, argues that war is good because it brings out human courage, honor, and self sacrifice. In the end, Ludendorff is proved right. Without the war, Trevor would never have been able to sacrifice himself and show Diana there are human qualities worth saving.Contrast this with the ending of The Fifth Element (1997), when Leeloo, the supreme being, goes into shock when she sees the horrors humanity has inflicted. Korben Dallas shows her humanity should be saved because of our capacity for love. By expressing his love for Leeloo, Dallas provides the 'fifth element' essential for life. By choosing self sacrifice over love as the redemptive quality, Wonder Woman accidentally makes war and conflict an essential feature of humanity.None of this is to say Wonder Woman is a bad movie. As far as super hero films are concerned, this is in the top ten, but that doesn't make it infallible. I wish the filmmakers had paid as much attention to the plot as they did the action, pacing, humor, and visual style.",8,7,13,29 September 2017
Mother!," A Pretentious Danse Macabre
","Mother! (2017), staring Jennifer Lawrence as the titular character and Javier Bardem as her husband, Him, is writer/director Darren Aronofsky's nihilistic allegory for Biblical creation and the rape of nature. Though marketed as a psychological thriller, Aronofsky told Vanity Fair after the Toronto International Film Festival the film is 'about how it must feel to be Mother Nature.' It was partially inspired by Shel Silverstein's picture book The Giving Tree. No, really.The story itself isn't very interesting. A writer lives with his much younger wife in an old octagonal farm house on the prairie. Uninvited house guests interrupt their solitude. Their transgressions worsen, climaxing in a murder that leaves a permanent, bloody scar in the floor. Things settle down again after Mother becomes pregnant, but then crescendo into an orgy of violence and depravity as the writer's fans take over the house and begin worshiping him.It's difficult to say for what audience Mother! was intended. People who enjoy long, boring interludes punctuated by moments of extreme violence? It's not for the squeamish or easily triggered, but it's not a work of genius either. For my part, it was painful to see talented actors and actresses, including Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, wasted on this pretentious monstrosity.Throughout the film, and especially in the final act, Mother is marginalized, tormented, brutalized, and violated. At one point, her clothes are torn open and she is repeatedly punched in the face. Finally, her heart is torn from her burnt chest. I think it's a little bizarre that A-list actress Jennifer Lawrence, who prides herself on playing strong female leads and on being a role model for young women, would agree to star in her boyfriend's deranged snuff film.I'm not going to call her a hypocrite, but after reading her explanation in The Telegraph, all I could think was, wow, this person is really dumb. Aronofsky compounds that feeling when he explains that he wrote the script's first draft in five days, and that it stemmed from his frustration at not being able to do anything about 'living on this planet and sort of seeing what's happening around us.' Oh brother. Lawrence and Aronofsky's combined net worth is $145 million. They're powerless to help the planet? Try planting a tree or picking up some trash on the sidewalk.The pernicious belief that the earth would be better off without human beings is fashionable among radical environmentalists, and illustrated in Mother! by Mother's constant pleading and begging Him to get rid of their annoying house guests and return to their solitude. Yet without humanity, there is no theater, no movie, no audience, and no point to be made. As Nietzsche says in his essay On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense, 'Â…this intellect has no additional mission which would lead it beyond human life.' I bring this up simply to illustrate that what we're seeing on screen is Darren Aronofsky's own self-defeating revulsion and disgust at humanity, not some clever point about how nature is harmonious without human beings. Aronofsky has clearly cast Javier Bardem not as God the Father but as himselfâ€“the creator of this film and someone who harbors deep resentment toward humanity.Audiences have strongly reacted to this film. I saw one couple leave during the infanticide scene, but overall I found it incredibly boring. If I wasn't writing a review, I probably would have walked out of the theater as well. When Mother wakes up the morning after having sex and declares 'I'm pregnant,' someone in the audience actually started laughing. I had a hard time staying awake until the end.When Alejandro Jodorowsky's Fando y Lis premiered at the 1968 Acapulco Film Festival, a riot broke out and the director's car was pelted with rocks. It was banned by the Mexican government for its sacrilegious depiction of Catholic ritual. Like Fando y Lis, Mother! also features surreal scenes, cannibalism, and a female protagonist being brutalized by a frenzied mob. Will Mother! have as much impact in today's America? Or will audiences simply react with revulsion to its grotesque Grand Guignol and miss the religious symbolism altogether? Overall, there's not much positive to be taken away from this film, although I did appreciate the setting. Everything had a raw, earthy look and feel. Real texture. I love when the characters literally dig into it and organic wounds open up as though the house itself is alive. Once again, style trumps substance in 2017.",3,20,39,3 October 2017
The Nice Guys," Film Noir for the Disco Era
","An unlikely duo must team up to find a missing girl before a secret cabal has her murdered in The Nice Guys (2016), a comedic crime drama written by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi and directed by Shane Black. Set in 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys is a film noir for the disco era, but wasn't originally written as a period piece. Thankfully, the writers decided to rework the concept and what resulted was one of the best films of 2016.Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a muscle-for-hire who Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley) pays to dissuade private detective Holland March (Ryan Gosling) from looking for her. March, an alcoholic who lives with his preteen daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice), believes Amelia is somehow connected to the death of porn star Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio). Misty's aunt, Mrs. Glenn (Lois Smith), hired March to investigate Misty's death because she believed Misty might still be alive.When two anonymous men (Beau Knapp and Keith David) show up at Jackson Healy's apartment to press him for details on Amelia's whereabouts, he decides to pay March to help him locate Amelia before they do. Together, they discover Amelia and Misty were connected to an underground adult film allegedly exposing a conspiracy on the part of auto manufacturers to suppress the catalytic converter. Several people involved in the movie turned up dead.Things get really complicated when Amelia's mother, Judith (Kim Basinger), a prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice, pays March and Healy to find her daughter. When Amelia literally falls into their laps, she accuses her mother of being part of the conspiracy. March and Healy slowly put the pieces together, but will they rescue her and the last remaining film reel in time to expose the truth? Nice Guys was loosely inspired by true events, although it wasn't advertised as such. Because of its particular geography, Los Angeles has long suffered from lingering smog, which was a pervasive problem in the mid-twentieth century. The film pokes fun at activists protesting 'bird killing' pollution, but people really did wear gas masks to protest LA smog and it did have negative and long-term consequences for public health.Auto emissions were a contributing factor to airborne toxins until 1975 when the Environmental Protection Agency mandated all new cars come equipped with a catalytic converter. GM, Ford, and Chrysler (the 'Big Three') agreed to research pollution-reducing technologies in 1953 but dragged their heels. The Justice Department filed an anti-trust case against the Big Three in 1968, alleging a conspiracy to suppress pollution-reducing technologies. So the events that formed a backdrop for the film occurred years before the film takes place.Nice Guys is more concerned with evoking the Zeitgeist of the decade rather than a strict adherence to facts. It was a brief time in American history when adult films were socially relevant. The 1970s are sometimes referred to as the 'Golden Age of Porn,' when porn achieved some mainstream success with films like Deep Throat (1972) and The Devil in Miss Jones (1973). There were also widespread but unsubstantiated fears of Mafia influence in the adult film industry, which Judith uses as a red herring in this film.Nice Guys features several strong performances. Ryan Gosling is a Canadian actor with a long career in film and television, most notably in The Notebook (2004) and The Place Beyond the Pines (2012). In 2016, he also starred in La La Land, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. Holland March is a less serious role, demonstrating Gosling's versatility as an actor. Audiences and critics loved it. For this performance, he was nominated for 'Favorite Comedic Movie Actor' at the People's Choice Awards and was awarded 'Best Comedic Performance' by the San Diego Film Critics Society.Angourie Rice, a young Australian actress, had her breakout role in The Nice Guys. Since then, she's appeared in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), which was praised by audiences and critics, and The Beguiled (2017), which was not. Her character in The Nice Guys, Holly, is an adorably precocious child, insisting she can help her father solve the case (since her father is an incompetent drunk, who can blame her?). Like Natalie Portman in The Professional (1994), Angourie is perfect for the role, and hopefully will have a bright future in film.Nice Guys is funny, clever, and expertly manages a purposely convoluted and over-the-top plot ala The Big Lebowski (1998) and Fargo (1996). Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling perfectly play off each other's strengths, and bring a sense of ironic humor and style to an otherwise bleak and cynical world.",10,0,1,26 November 2017
Alien: Covenant," A Messy Prequel-Sequel
","Alien: Covenant (2017) stars Katherine Waterston as a colony ship scientist named Daniels, and Michael Fassbender, who plays dual roles as two androids named David and Walter, in a sci-fi horror film and the latest installment in the Alien franchise. It was directed by Ridley Scott and written by John Logan and Dante Harper. John Logan is an accomplished screen writer, but this was Dante Harper's first screenplay. Michael Green (of Sex and the City and Green Lantern) and Jack Paglen are credited with writing the story.So many different writers is probably why Alien: Covenant felt like so many different films. It was supposed to be a sequel to Prometheus (2012), but often felt like a reboot of Alien (1979). Minus the events on the planet's surface, Alien: Covenant was basically an updated version of the original. It flirted with its roots as a horror film, but lacked tension and suspense.Alien: Covenant begins in a sterile room with Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) and his synthetic creation, David. They muse on the nature of creation before the film shifts to the colonization ship Covenant, which is heading toward a remote planet, Origae-6. A neutrino burst damages the ship as it is recharging, killing some colonists as well as the ship's captain, Jacob Branson (James Franco). The crew wakes up and Christopher Oram (Billy Crudup) takes command. While making repairs, pilot Tennessee Faris (Danny McBride) hears a strange signal. The crew tracks the signal to a nearby planet and decides to investigate.There they find the ruins of an ancient civilization, a crashed ship, and one survivor: David. After a few of the landing party die from a mysterious biological weapon, the survivors gradually discover David was not only responsible for the deaths of the planet's former inhabitants, but also the creation of a dangerous xenomorph. A xenomorph manages to get onto the colony ship, with the usual results. Eventually, Daniels, a '90s tomboy (ala Single White Female) and the remaining crew members trap the creature and eject it into space.If Alien: Covenant was just a reboot of the 1979 original, it would have been much better. The space scenes were even terrifying at times. Unfortunately, the effort to shoehorn this movie into a Prometheus sequel fell flat. The plot was convoluted and nonsensical. It completely ignored franchise cannon and was, frankly, boring. The film's run time was over two hours. Cutting at least 30 minutes could have greatly improved it, especially from the opening scenes. No one watches an Alien movie to be treated to a philosophical treatise on the nature of creation.In the original Alien, as well as its immediate sequels, the audience assumes the alien xenomorphs are just some terrifying life form encountered in deep space. It spoke to human fears of the unknown. No one was asking for a convoluted origin story. Part of what makes these creatures so terrifying is how little we know about them. Any origin story, let alone one as Baroque as this, undermines that.There were some highlights, including genuinely disturbing and terrifying scenes. Danny McBride added much needed color and liveliness to the film. His was the only character that wasn't morose, depressed, and dispassionate. Despite some unfair comparisons between Katherine Waterston and Sigourney Weaver, I thought she gave a solid performance. Overall, Alien: Covenant could have benefited from liberal editing, but is thrilling enough for a Friday night on the couch.",5,0,1,29 September 2017
