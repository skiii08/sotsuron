Mission: Impossible III," Isn't it a pity that the IMF's defibrillators take 30s to charge...
","For an organisation which has so much of high tech stuff, it's really a pity that they have defibrillators which take 30s to charge to 150J. Any hospital in the real world will have one's that charge in less than 5s. If only they had borrowed one, agent Farris' life could have been saved. God where do the script writers live!That really spoiled the movie for me. I know it is make believe but it has to be believable for the viewer to enjoy it. Hope the franchise ends here or they hire better writers. The style of the movie was better though. I really did't miss the slow mo action of the last movie....",3,0,1,19 November 2006
