3:10 to Yuma," An excellent western
","3:10 to Yuma is a very good western film. It is high on themes and high on chase sequences and shootouts. The story concerns a small-time rancher who agrees to escort a captured outlaw to court in Yuma. Both the principal actors Christian Bale and Russell Crowe play off each other really well and in the end they have mutual respect for one another. Ben Foster, Peter Fonda and Gretchen Mol are good support. James Mangold has a unique style- all his films the character development trumps action and 3:10 to Yuma has just that. Of course the action- especially the last 30 minutes is amazing.",Null,1,2,2 August 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Great sequel to the Captain America saga
","This is an improvement on its predecessor. The first two-thirds of The Winter Soldier almost feel more like a Cold War-era espionage thriller than a superhero movie. The movie concludes with the expected special effects-laden battles and beat-the-clock action but those scenes are composed more coherently than related sequences in similar movies. And, although The Winter Soldier is available in 3-D, it's perfectly capable of being enjoyed in the less expensive 2-D format. The Winter Soldier is effectively paced with enough action to keep things moving but not so much that it overwhelms everything. One of the keys to the film's efficacy is that it takes the time to develop the relationships among the four key members. The narrative contains its share of unpredictable elements and isn't afraid to shake up the status quo.",Null,0,0,24 December 2018
Gone Baby Gone," Affleck shows directing chops with Gone Baby Gone
","Ben Affleck is a good director and with Gone baby Gone he has shown that he might very well transform into a top caliber one with time. The best mystery novels are the ones that use the genre as a stepping-off point for developing characters and examining issues. Affleck has successfully captured the essence of a written mystery on the screen. The production engages viewers not only on an emotional level but on an intellectual one. As the onion-like layers of the story are peeled away to reveal new ethical dilemmas that force the lead character to question what truly is 'right,' we are invited to answer those questions alongside him then evaluate whether the consequences of his choices justify the decisions he made. It's a rare motion picture that provides such an uncompromising perspective of what is right and what is moral. This is an auspicious start by Affleck.",Null,0,1,6 February 2019
District 9," Awesome original science fiction film
","Set and shot in South Africa District 9 is a great debut by Neill Bloomkamp and features some gritty locations and actions sequences often layered by comedic elements. Of course, what makes the film special is the underlying theme and message of apartheid and racism. You should watch this movie if you like anything to do with aliens because it is much different than what we usually see.",Null,0,1,8 October 2018
Meet Joe Black," An okay one time watch for the cast
","Meet Joe Black is ultimately a disappointment and an an exercise in how one should understand the pacing of the movie. Starring Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani and Anthony Hopkins this is based on an older film called Death takes a Holiday (1934). Brad Pitt dies and is reborn as 'death' and enters a wealthy mogul's life to understand the meaning of life, meanwhile falling in love with his daughter. The pacing is a killer and sorry to say but the acting is pedestrian- especially Brad Pitt. It seems they're all here to collect paychecks to buy mansion, the likes shown in this film. Avoid.",Null,1,2,20 August 2018
Limitless," A fun movie to watch with some badass sequences
","Limitless is a good film but not great because it becomes a generic action movie after a while when the potential could have been a lot more. The story is about a writer suffering from a terrible case of writer's block and some personal life issues to boot. He is offered a sort of wonder-pill which does wonders, and he is not only able to get over his block but do some great things also. He demands more of this pill and gets sucked into a cesspool of crime and danger. Bradley Cooper is likeable enough to carry this film (He's pretty much the only consistent character) and De Niro gets a moment to spout some cool stuff. The special effects deserve a mention and there is some stunning infinite zoom scenes especially the opener. Plus, the entire film has a kind of kinetic or synthetic energy which is rather cool.",Null,0,0,5 July 2018
The Green Mile," Darabond proves his mettle with Green Mile
","Frank Darabond is one of those filmmaker's who isn't exactly known all that much, even by people who tend to notice the behind the camera happenings but one look at his filmography and you see that he is special: Shawshank Redemption, The Mist and of course The Green Mile are all not just great but genre defining movies. Green Mile is helped immensely by a great performance by Michael Clarke Duncan and ably supported by Tom Hanks and Sam Rockwell in one of his earliest roles. This crime drama is more heart than suspense or thrills but it is a great, unmissable film nonetheless.",Null,0,0,20 September 2018
Blade Runner," Ridley's scifi masterpiece is one of the greatest films ever
","Blade Runner is considered one of the greatest science fiction films ever made and it is easy to see why. Deeply thematic, rich characters, a fantastic script and nuanced performances toppled with some of the greatest cinematography ever put on film this is a film version of the mona lisa- every frame can be hung on a wall. Ridley Scott, fresh off the success of Alien is in top form and Blade Runner will be the film he will always be remembered for. Harrison Ford is competent as Deckard and anyone expecting him to be the usual dashing hero will be disappointed. Rutger Hauer steals the show as head replicant Roy Batty. The noir look of the film has inspired so many movies and video games since there isn't really a point talking about it- you have to see it to believe it. One of the greatest films ever made. Period.",Null,7,10,5 September 2018
