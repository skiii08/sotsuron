Requiem for a Dream," Not intriguing enough
","Actors played very well and the theme music was absolutely stuning. The sounds at some scenes was like a drill in our ears, and the constant blinking lights made us feel like in a cheap thiller movie. Although there was some character development and the story was clear, I was not quite intrigued by it.",6,2,3,8 February 2020
