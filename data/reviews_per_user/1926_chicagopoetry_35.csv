The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Angst Overdose
","I usually don't bother reviewing anything at IMDb that's already been reviewed a hundred times, but since the vast majority of reviews here are glowing, I thought I'd offer my two cents.I kind of hated Perks of Being a Wallflower. Why? It was like an angst overdose in a depressing fantasy world. Now I know there exists bullying in high school, but generally high school is not like it is portrayed here. Everyone in high school is not mean to you from the first to the last day and even if jocks can be insensitive, depicting them as nothing but evil bullies is a tired, stale plot mechanism.The main character Charlie is so introverted that we never quite care about him. I'm remembering the introverted character from Almost Famous and how he ended up being really funny and lovable. I really didn't feel anything for Charlie. And both his parents are just robots so we're never given an explanation of why he is the way he is other than his aunt molested him and then died in a car accident. Really? That's what totally screwed up an otherwise normal, intelligent, halfway good looking kid?Patrick is probably the best character but, really, he's a flaming queer and knows every word of the Rocky Horror Picture Show by heart but he has never heard of David Bowie's song Heroes? Really? And he isn't into theater? He just goes to parties and acts flamboyant while he is secretly depressed? Yet he and the rest of the 'wallflowers' probably have more friends than any of the so-called 'cool' kids do, so what are they so depressed about?The teacher Mr. Anderson is a minor, minor character yet supposedly he has a great impact on Charlie's life. Why? Because he gives him books? There seemed to be some homo-erotic thing going on there that's never touched upon. Perhaps a moment a bit more awkward than the hug Charlie gives him--that might have shed some light on their mysterious relationship.Charlie's high school crush Sam is an okay character but she also just sort of goes along with the absence of plot. She tells Charlie that she loves him but then she acts totally surprised when Charlie kisses her during the game of truth or dare. Really? And then later she's in love with him again or something. Whatever.And of course there's Brad (no, can't be a reference to Rocky Horror, can it) the football star who is having a secret love affair with Patrick, a love affair that's so obvious that the only ones who can't see it are all Brad's knuckle-headed jock friends who don't even question him even when Patrick practically announces it in the cafeteria.And where are the rest of the freshman, and the sophomores, and the juniors. This schools seems to have one freshman, Charlie, and everyone else is a senior. It makes NO sense.I kept looking at the time realizing I still had forty five minutes, a half hour, twenty minutes to go, wanting to puke from eating so much angst, until I finally was shouting out loud 'It's David Bowie's song Heroes, good God, it's not exactly obscure!!!!'",4,67,143,10 December 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," 10 Whatever Lane
","I usually don't write reviews for IMDb when there are already 175 reviews written but since I expect my opinions to be brief, why not, maybe someone will read them among all the odd glowing reviews of this totally average film. (Can't explain this mess without spoilers so be warned.)Okay. First thing. This film has absolutely NOTHING to do with Cloverfield. Nothing. Period. Even the weird aliens that turn up at the end look nothing like what was presented in Cloverfield and their presence is short, so get it out of your head that this has anything to do with Cloverfield.Other than that, this was about as entertaining as two episodes of The Walking Dead back to back minus the zombies. Sure, there was some suspense, but nothing more than you'll see in a cable television show. John Goodman lost a little weight since his whale of an appearance in Trumpo but he's still way out of shape, gasping for breath just to move across the room, so the idea that two healthy young people can't take him on in his little bunker is just absurd. Just put some of those cans of food in a sock and whack him over the head already, I was saying to myself.So most of the movie is John Goodman holding two younger adults hostage in his bunker while we aren't sure what exactly has happened outside. At one point the young woman almost escapes but she sees another woman trying to get into the bunker who is like, I don't know, burning up, or dying from some disease, or bubbling from acid air or something. But then when the young woman finally escapes toward the end there is no acid air or poison air or whatever so what was that all about? I don't know. Makes no sense.Okay, so basically, most of the movie is John Goodman holding these guys in his bunker against their will and then the young woman escapes to find out indeed the world has been taken over by aliens and then it's like, okay, tune in to episode three, except there is no episodeThe end.",5,1,5,26 March 2016
The Hangover," What Happens In Vegas, Um, What Happened?
","The Hangover is a funny grown up version of Dude Where's My Car without the bubble wrap or the space men or the Chinese fast food drive in or that guy from That 70s Show. It's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas except there is a plot instead of Johnny Depp and they've taken drugs unknowingly. It's Pinapple Express but with roofies instead of marijuana and there is a Wedding Crashers ending instead of a John Woo shoot out. It's The Big Lebowski if you took all the Chinatown elements out of it and just made a movie about intoxicated people running around trying to figure out what happened. It's pretty funny, I'll give you that.",8,1,2,19 June 2009
It," IT . . . was just okay
","I haven't read the book.I actually paid $22 to see this on IMAX (well, what they're calling IMAX at the Regal anyway), that's how up for it I was. I very, very rarely pay to see a film in a theater with so many online options available, but hey, Richard Roeper said it was not only one of the best horror films ever made but one of the best films of ANY genre ever made. I should have known better. I lost respect for Roeper when he gave Jupiter Ascending an F. Anyway, no, it's not one of the best films ever made, not even one of the best horror films ever made, and I'll tell you why.Mind you, I haven't read the book.So what we have is Goonies or Stand By Me or more recently Stranger Things (you know, a group of boys, sometimes with one girl thrown in, having an adventure together), except this time around these kids aren't naive or innocent so to speak. They all have dealt or are currently dealing with some horrific trauma. It's a nice plot twist that IT feeds on their real life fears, but since their real life existence is actually in a way just as or more terrifying than a ghost clown is, it kind of makes the ghost clown less terrifying. All the adults in this film are just sons of bitches, so compared to this ghost clown, who isn't real so to speak and who isn't going to be around permanently, the adults in this film are more horrifying than the monster is. And the bullies, who are but a mere pack of caricatures, are so conscienceless and ruthless that they defy plausibility and once again come off as more menacing than even Pennywise.Like I said I saw this in IMAX. I didn't really want to see it in IMAX but that just happened to be what was playing at the time of day I was available. And let me tell you it was LOUD. Way too loud. Too loud for a horror film. A scary horror film has to have some subtly. This thing was just a constant barrage of obnoxious music you'd expect from Indiana Jones not a film about a killer clown, people screaming, Pennywise screeching, the bullies yelling. Never in this film are you given a chance to relax, which makes the jumps scares, and that's pretty much all the scares there are here, much less effective.In my opinion the kids couldn't act that well. Often times they seemed to be reciting lines. All the cute one liners that were suppose to be funny fell flat. It was very formulaic. I didn't understand why the female lead was being bullied. She's borderline gorgeous and smart and witty but for some reason the homely dumb girls pick on her. It just didn't work for me. And there were a lot of other things that were completely implausible. Early in the film the short chubby kid gets a really major wound (trying not to spoil things) on his gut, but in the next scene he's swimming in a quarry. Lol. What? As for Pennywise, was Bill Skarsgard even there? Most of the clown scenes were CGI, and the ones that weren't, I mean he's so heavily made up in costume and white face did it really matter who was behind there? And without fail, just when he was getting creepy, suddenly there'd be a big bang of music and the CGI clown would scream and come rushing at lighting speed at whoever was the victim at the time. This happened so many times it stopped being scary because we expected it. And we never get to know why Pennywise is even haunting these kids. We knew why Freddy Krugar haunted kids. Their parents burned him to death for being a child molester. But what's Pennywise's motivation. Some vague things are mentioned about the history of the town but it's never revealed why this ghost clown has come back to haunt the kids of Derry. Didn't make sense.And the movie is way too long. Way too long. It's a movie about a killer clown, for crying out loud, not Schindler's List. I was yawning by the end and could barely sit through yet another scene where the kids are all bonding together. These are my thoughts. I could go on or edit this thing to make a much finer review but there's already over 200 reviews here for this film so this will be all the time I'll invest in it.I give it six stars.",6,22,42,9 September 2017
Hereditary," Good Acting, Visually Disturbing, But Makes No Sense
","Personally I think Toni Collette should at least be nominated for an Oscar for her performance here. She really nails a mentally unstable person going off the deep end. Unfortunately the movie itself might be better considered for a Razzie. It doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a movie about the delusions of a crazy person ala BUG or is it about something truly supernatural--or both? I'm betting it's trying to be both but, eh, that just doesn't work because in that case you can't follow anything, nothing makes sense and you can't really get too invested in the characters because you don't know if they're coming out of right or left field. And this film is way too long. At over two hours to be honest, it gets kind of boring.",6,10,23,9 June 2018
The Danish Girl," Really Wanted This Painful Experiment to be OVER
","I like to think I'm as open minded as I can be. Perhaps if I was in a room with a bunch of transgender people they might not see me that way, but I think if I was in a room with a bunch of raving Republicans I would be seen as pretty darn liberal. I think I can defend my open mindedness simply due to the fact that I sat down and eagerly watched The Danish Girl with, well, an open mind. So it pains me to say that watching The Danish Girl I found myself at times laughing when it was not appropriate and also just wanting to gag when it was certainly not intended by the filmmakers. This film is about a guy who, after dressing up like a woman to appease his artist wife who needed a female model, finds himself addicted to dressing up in women's clothing, then succumbs to what can only be described as a schizophrenic bout of split personality during which he thinks he is a woman, resulting in several failed attempts to lock him up in an insane asylum before he finally comes across a surgeon who offers to quite literally cut his penis off and build him a makeshift vagina. This is not such a strange tale actually if it were happening today, I guess, but this tale is happening at the turn of the century (19th to 20th Century that is) and our supposed 'transgender hero' {{SPOILER ALERT}} DIES as a result of the surgery!!!!Seriously? Uck. Just, you know, uck.",4,23,49,22 December 2015
Ted," A Missed Opportunity
","TED had the potential to be a classic movie like BIG or like ELF, both of which were magical tales about childhood dreams set in the adult world. Unfortunately, TED cops out and goes for the cheap shots with jokes about prostitutes pooping on the floor or a teddy bear squirting hand cream all over its face to suggest to a woman what he wants to do to her (she goes out with him anyway). What made BIG and ELF so funny was how innocent the main characters were in the adult world. But TED is a perverted sociopath. And why? That part is never explained. The plot jumps straight from the bear announcing its presence to the child to the bear smoking pot from a bong on a couch. Are we suppose to love him? How can we, when he's a raging racist, homophobe? Something else that made BIG and ELF funny is how the rest of the world responded to the main characters. Here we are to believe the world just accepts the idea of a talking teddy bear and nobody acts surprised. We are to believe everyone in the world saw the Tonight Show thirty years ago and that makes it all acceptable. Why the writers of this dud chose to do it this way is a mystery. It would have been so much funnier if people actually reacted the way people would actually react to a talking teddy bear. Unlike BIG or ELF, films that live on and can be watched again and again, TED will have its flash in the pan and then it will just fade away. Because it makes no sense. At least in BAD SANTA we understood why this particular SANTA was so perverted. Here we are to believe that sitting around smoking pot and watching FLASH GORDON turns you into a lunatic rapist. Not funny.",4,26,47,7 July 2012
Pirate Radio," Uplifting, Entertaining, Hilarious, Lovable: Rock 'N Roll
","This is exactly what the world needs, a good, warm-hearted, fun movie about friendship and camaraderie in which nobody dies, the only violence is a ten second, goofy bar brawl during a drunken stag party, and the evil villain is the personification of censorship. This movie is like the first half hour of The Deer Hunter except they then don't go off to war but continue to party for another hour and a half. The most excellent soundtrack of sixties British rock songs are only one highlight that will make you cheer as you watch The Boat That Rocked. The characters are perfectly cast, the plot is ultra-simple yet somehow it keeps your interest from beginning to end, and the comedy is character driven rather than slapstick: and the good guys win! This will be a wonderful movie to see around the holidays as it will keep you cheering. It's a bloody gas.",10,9,14,29 August 2009
Spotlight," Right Up There With All The President's Men
","Mark Ruffalo definitely deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of an investigative journalist so in love with his job that the only exercise he gets is jogging to work. He nails it with such sincerity that he left me feeling like I was feeling what he was feeling. I don't know if his role would be considered best actor or best supporting actor-- seems the Academy decides that by a flip of the coin. Michael Keaton does a fantastic job but this time around it's Ruffalo, the best I've seen from him ever, hands down. Rachel McAdam's puts the powerful female character wasted in the utterly confusing True Detective Season Two to better use as another member of the investigative team. And the rest of the cast is nothing short of brilliant and convincing. This is one of those rare movies that can build almost unbearable suspense with not much more than phone calls and note taking. What makes this such a nail biter is just simply how realistic it's all portrayed. You REALLY feel like you're in that newsroom; you REALLY identify with each of the characters and understand what they are going through and the stakes involved. This is one of those gems like Glengary Glenn Ross that will have you on the edge of your seat even though there isn't a single bullet fired, explosion, killing or action sequence whatsoever. Bravo to Spotlight.",10,5,10,14 November 2015
Concussion," Will Smith Delivers an Oscar Worthy Performance
","I have to be honest. I haven't been a huge fan of Will Smith the actor. He always seems to be doing not much more than playing himself in his roles. Even in The Pursuit of Happiness it was hard for me to forget that the character I was watching was Will Smith instead of who it was suppose to be. This works well for him when he's doing comedy or action such as Men in Black or Bad Boys, but not so much when he's taking on something dramatic that requires a transformation into an actual role. (To be fair, I can't seem to remember ever watching Ali and I suppose I should do that.) Finally, though, after 25 years of trying, he's done it for me with Concussion. He truly captures the role of a Nigerian brain specialists and I almost immediately forget that he's Will Smith and I relate instead to the character he's playing. And he pulls it off with such grace that I do believe he deserves at least his third nomination for best actor if not the award itself.As for the film, I liked it a lot. The first half plays like a very taught thriller and had me on the edge of my seat. The second half gets a bit too melodramatic for my taste but not so much that I started squirming (well, maybe just a little). I think if the second half was given a bit more editing, speeding it up, this could have been a ten star film but eight stars, which is what I give it, isn't anything to shake a stick at either.So there you have it--my take on Concussion.",8,24,45,22 December 2015
Milk," Sean Penn Should Win An Oscar
","Sean Penn totally makes up for his bland portrayal of Willie Stark in All The Kings Men with this, his career high, his portrayal of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician. Furthermore, he really makes up for his part in I Am Sam; we can now forgive him for that one. If Sean Penn as Milk isn't Oscar material I haven't seen Oscar material. Gay or straight, doesn't matter, you aren't going to see a performance like Penn's very often. It is classic, daring, brave and convincing. This entire epic is shear perfection, movie making like it ought to be, historic. This is what we call a classic, a slice of Americana, thee great American movie. This is an extremely important movie as well. The issues of prejudice that it deals with could not be timelier than now, in an age when America has voted into office the first black President. Once in a while Sean Penn pops up and proves to us that he is a great actor, and here he goes, doing it again.",10,8,16,14 December 2008
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino's Tribute to his own early days
","Watched The Hateful Eight. It's quite literally a combination of Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, and his most recent, Django, as it's set in a claustrophobic environment like Dogs and is a Western dealing with racism like Django and is a brutal bloodbath like both those films. It's truly an ugly film without any morals and this is a huge swing for Tarantino who tried to get all moral with his last few films. The acting is impressive throughout (Samuel L. Jackson is actually the lead character in this one) and the thin plot is forgivable because anyone who has followed Tarantino up until now knows the point is the great big monologue leading up to the sudden eruption of violence, and in this sense it certainly does not disappoint. I doubt this is going to score any Oscars because this time around it is truly a b-movie rather than a parody of one, but if you love Tarantino for his earliest work this one will seem like it should have been his third film, not his eighth.",8,8,36,20 December 2015
The Adventures of Tintin," The 99% Want Their Money Back, TInTin
","I just watched TinTin and I couldn't help thinking what a horrible waste of 130 million dollars. Why are the Occupy people protesting Wall Street, when the biggest waste of American dollars is by far coming out of Hollywood. I mean, I guess if you're a fan of TinTin, or if you find some significance in the fact that a mediocre combination of Raiders of the Lost Arc and Pirates of the Caribbean was created in 3D animation, you may find some value in this big dud. But looking at it from my perspective, from someone who when he first saw the poster for this bomb thought it was for a Rin Tin Tin movie, and who has never even heard of TinTin, but beyond that who values movies for their plot, acting and plausibility above all else: this is by far the worst movie of 2011. If Steven Spielberg had bothered to actually make a live action film, he would have had to train a dog to act like it understands the English language, justify how our heroes flew to Africa on fumes burped out of a drunk, create all those big noses and make them look realistic, and actually instruct the actors to act. Now that would have been a good movie. Instead, we get an eagle that has somehow been trained to fetch a particular shred of paper, characters who know they are in danger yet without fail wander off to get whacked on the head and captured and who insist on pointing out the obvious ('Two boats are missing! One of them must have been a decoy!' --duh). And if you aren't familiar with TinTin forget about it, because this story jumps right into the adventure from moment one without introducing the characters or allowing us to understand their motivations. I said to myself, okay, some red headed kid with a weird haircut is doing all the things I would expect from Indiana Jones--why should I care? And for an animated film, this one isn't exactly for kids. TinTin carries a pistol and uses it, people are tied up and dropped into the ocean to drown, someone tries to shoot someone else with a bazooka, along with various other PG violence. So who is the target audience? It's too silly for adults and too violent for kids. What a waste of 130 million dollars. Blah.",2,15,38,10 November 2011
Shutter Island," In Defense of Shutter Island
","Many critics have ripped on Shutter Island, calling the acting bad and criticizing the dialogue. I read so many bad reviews of Shutter Island that I almost didn't even want to watch it. After I watched it, I had to watch it again a few days later. Shutter Island is a completely brilliant film. There is not a single frame wasted. Scorsese completely plays with his audience's minds with this tribute to the noir genre, at times making DiCaprio look like Marlon Brando, at other times using colors and lighting to inspire a Hitchcockian sense of deja vu. After watching Shutter Island I had to wonder what movie the critics watched, and if they had even bothered to finish watching it to the end.The only way I can defend this movie from the critics who are bashing it is to include some spoilers here, so if you don't want anything given away, stop reading this right now. The ending of this movie explains it all. The reason some of the acting is intentionally bad is because everyone in this movie is acting out an elaborate game of role playing. The reason some of the dialogue doesn't make sense is because practically everything that is said has two meanings, the meaning interpreted by 'The Marshal' while he is living out his complex hallucination, and the real meaning that isn't revealed until the mystery is solved, a meaning that you probably won't entirely grasp until a second viewing of this film. Upon a second viewing, multiple layers of subtleties are revealed and everything makes perfect sense. Everyone's gestures and pauses and eye movements are revealed to be not bad acting but the brilliantly portrayed behavior of those who are 'in on it.' This one is right up there with great movies such as Taxi Driver or The Unforgiven. It is simply an example of superb film making.",10,2,6,23 February 2010
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Beware the p(l)ot holes near the billboards
","I will say that I enjoyed this film, mostly due to Frances McDormand's performance. It was surprisingly funny given its subject matter. But after thinking about it for a few days after watching it, I have to say a few words about the writing, because it seems everyone is raving about how 'Oscar worthy' the writing here is, and at first glance, I thought so too. But thinking back on it, I'd have to say the writing is actually pretty sloppy. There's a lot of stuff here that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and I mean a lot. I can't explain this without revealing spoilers, so be warned.--Most strikingly the (deputy?) Chief Dixon violently attacks Welby, busts his face with his gun, throws him out of a window and proceeds to kick him while he's down, all in eyes view of the new Chief Abercrombie. Sure, he gets fired. But not arrested? Not even sued?--And as for Abercrombie. He shows up the morning after the previous Police Chief died and declares that 'they' sent him as a replacement. They who? Is there some force outside of Ebbing that dictates who their police chief is? That part really didn't make any sense to me. Also, replacing one of the main characters halfway through the film, a character we're starting to get to know, with a stereotype that we don't know anything about, was rather odd.--Someone lights the billboards on fire. But apparently only the paper on them burns, not the old wood that's been sitting there decaying since the 80s, because they are able to paste duplicate posters to the existing structures without any problems. That's laughable. That old wood would have been a pile of smoldering cinder.--Mildred is portrayed as such a tough-ass, assaulting a dentist, kicking children in the crotch (with no repercussions I might add), storming into the police station spouting vulgarities, but when she's confronted by a guy who suggests he's actually the one who killed her daughter, she freezes and seems helpless. One might say the fact that she didn't go psycho in this scene is what makes this screenplay original but someone else, like me, might argue that it's just out of her character and doesn't make a lick of sense.--Chief Willoughby for some reason is an old geezer but has a young, attractive Australian wife. He also has two young girls. Yet he's completely vulgar around them. While instructing them about a game of fishing he invents, he calls the blanket they are sitting on the 'god-dam blanked'--twice--to little four or five year old girls. He says to his wife later that it's her turn to 'clean the horse *hit' out of the barn. OK, I actually have quite a bit of experience tending horses. It's not called '*hit' it's called manure and you wouldn't even call it that--you'd just say 'clean the barn' if you really owned horses. The writing of his character, other than the scene between him and McDormand while they were sitting on the swings, was actually horrible.--Mildred burns the police station down, throwing 5 Molotov cocktails out of the still broken windows of the advertising agency across the street (not boarded up by then?). And the new Chief just accepts the explanation that she didn't do it because she was with James. No more investigation. Ho hum. Police station burned but oh well. And then a few scenes later, Dixon is apparently in the suppose to be burned down police station sitting there having a conversation with the new Chief.--Dixon is a complete jerk to the bone. He gets a letter postmortem from the now deceased Chief. Suddenly he's a good guy. Yeah right.I could go on and on with this but I'm afraid my word limit here is going to expire soon. I'll still give this film a 7 star rating because I DID enjoy watching it, but the writing here is really not all it's cracked up to be. It does feel like it's a big novel with a lot of twists, but in retrospect it's more like a parody of a big novel with a lot of twists, and the twists don't make a whole lot of sense.",7,326,556,25 November 2017
The Revenant," I Wanted to Love It, But Didn't
","Oh what can I say about The Revenant? It's a two and an half hour epic with Leonardo DiCaprio doing his darndest to act like an injured man abandoned and trying to survive in a world of harsh elements and enemies, but unfortunately he's also up against a cast of others whose acting, to put it bluntly, just plain sucks. I've never seen Tom Hardy overact before, but here you have an example of it and it isn't pretty. I guess when you're doing three or four blockbusters a year, one of which requires you to play two different people, you have a hard time putting your heart and soul into your character.DiCaprio is also up against a script that kept me scratching my head. Everything in it seems borrowed and haphazardly pieced together: the opening action sequence seems borrowed from Saving Private Ryan (only with arrows and hooting 'Indians' instead of guns and Nazis); the mood seems borrowed from Into the Grey; the main character borrowed from Dances With Wolves (although stripped of all humanity and charm). Nothing seems new here. Furthermore, none of the characters are developed, likable or relatable. They are all fowl mouthed, brutal, murderous savages, including DiCaprio's character, whose only connection to humanity is his love for his son; and in regards to that, only God knows why, since the kid is so miserable, bitter and brooding himself.The Revenant is visually stunning (I'll hand it that), and if you can suspend your disbelief, you are in for a real treat. Personally, however, I couldn't get into the grand finale, when DiCaprio is sprinting, as nimble as a doe, through the ice and snow, when just a few weeks before in this movie time a great big bear mauled him so savagely that he barely clung to his life, tearing his flesh to shreds and breaking several of his bones--not to mention every thing that happens to him AFTER that--yet he's somehow back to full strength for the obligatory revenge scene. When exactly did his broken leg heal without being set or put into a cast, for example: when he was tumbling helplessly down a waterfall or when he was single-handedly taking on an entire French brigade?No. Sorry, Alejandro González Iñárritu. You can throw all the finesse in the world into your movie pal, but if it doesn't ring true, I won't be emotionally engaged.So there you have it: my take on The Revenant.",5,18,38,22 December 2015
Divergent," The Most Boring Movie I've Seen In Years
","I couldn't believe how boring Divergent was. There's no plot whatsoever. Nothing happens. It's like a bad episode of Star Trek. What did they spend $85 million on? There's no special effects whatsoever unless you consider a computer generated landscape of a futuristic Chicago a special effect. The acting is weak. The two main characters are completely miscast for a romance, it's borderline pedophilic. The filmwork feels like it was shot on a vid-cam. I would have walked out about three quarters of the way thru but didn't want to disturb the others in the theater so I just sat there yawning and rolling my eyes. What a stupid movie. I guess with this type of trash appealing to the Twilight slash Hunger Games crowd I should say, Oh mah gawd gag mah with a spoon.",2,25,44,23 March 2014
Twilight," What's the big deal?
","I don't know what the big deal about this movie is. Slow and boring. It may be the Lost Boys of the new century but it had no new ideas whatsoever. The special effects can be seen in their entirety in the trailers. The love relationships made no sense. Huh? What? Who cares? Whatever. So melodramatic, ick. We are never given a clue as to why this chick is so special that she should be clued into the secrets of the undead instead of the other thousands of students at her school. And why are all those kids so MATURE? A better movie about vampires in Alaska is 30 Days of Night. At least that's scary. This is just a bunch of long drawn out lines with moody music playing behind them.",4,4,9,27 November 2008
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Great Mission Impossible Installment
","Tom Cruise is a bit old and weathered but if you can believe Harrison Ford is still Indiana Jones surviving a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator, you can certainly believe Cruise is still Ethan Hunt, climbing up the sides of buildings, driving a convertible through a sandstorm and saving the world from nuclear destruction. There isn't much plot here but that's okay because it's all about the missions, involving wild and inventive technology and crazy action from beginning to end. And the settings are fantastic, from Russia to Saudi Arabia to India, this is James Bond and Spiderman all wrapped up into one. I really enjoyed it. Great sequel!",9,1,5,17 December 2011
Revolutionary Road," A Modern Streetcar Named Desire
","Revolutionary Road is about as good as family drama gets. Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have wonderful chemistry, although in this case their chemistry is the formula to nitro glycerin. Seven Pounds attempted to bring us to tears with multiple manipulative tricks, but Revolutionary Road actually does it with a simple story, well acted, about a troubled marriage. The theme is the paths we take, why we choose them, and the chances we are given, whether we recognize them or not. This is a pure emotional roller coaster ride, as classic as A Streetcar Named Desire or Goodbye Columbus. Too bad it's not released yet, because DiCaprio certainly would be among Sean Penn and Frank Langella in the running for Best Actor Oscar, and Winslet would have taken Best Actress. The part of the lunatic neighbor was a bit overacted, which is the one and only reason I knocked a point off the perfect ten this movie otherwise deserves.",9,5,11,27 December 2008
Foxcatcher," Incredibly Boring and Confusing
","I was really surprised by how boring Foxcatcher is. I was expecting something much more intense. Steve Carell is superb in his strictly dramatic portrayal of John du Pont; he's barely recognizable. And Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo also give it their all. But for the life of me, I have no idea what was going on. What was the problem between du Pont and Mark Schultz? Why did du Pont do what he did at the end of the film? I was expecting something in the lines of Rocky and instead it was more like Behind the Candelabra. I know it's based on a true story but I had no idea what the motivation of anyone was, why what was happening was happening. And the editing made it so long and drawn out. In one scene, du Pont asks his driver if it's snowing out; the driver says no, and then they just stand / sit there for ten or more seconds as if something important was happening in the stillness and silence. Except nothing important was happening. They were just sitting / standing there. That's just one example of many, many scenes that went on way too long giving this film no pace whatsoever.When the credits finally rolled after two long hours all I could do was shrug and ask 'What the hell was that even about?'",4,12,25,27 December 2014
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Dazzling Special Effects Spoiled By Mediocre Plot
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is groundbreaking in its use of motion capture technology but unfortunately the plot is pretty weak.First of all, if you've seen the previews of the film, you pretty much already know the plot, which takes away a great deal of enjoyment when watching it, already knowing what's going to happen, that is. The entire premise of having a big chimpanzee named Ceasar living under your roof is kind of implausible, especially since the next door neighbor objects so much and would have probably filed a complaint way before any of the real mayhem would have taken place. Also, I didn't buy how cruel the managers of the ape habitat, where Ceaser had to go after attacking the neighbor, were to their apes. If they hated apes so much why were they in the ape housing business in the first place? Most people who run zoos or animals shelters do so because they love animals. So that made no sense AT ALL. The ultimate bit of nonsense was how Ceasar knew to go to the lab and steal the canisters of virus and then bring them back to expose all the apes to it. Nothing in the plot suggested why he should have known how to do that, other than one sentence in which he was told that 'medicine' made him smarter. And then all of a sudden, after all the apes escaped, there were hundreds of them instead of a few dozen of them, and they for some reason had superpowers and could smash straight through big panes of glass without getting injured and could pull spears right off wrought iron fencing. If you ever see a wrought iron fence with pointy spikes on top try pulling one of them from its welding and see how far you get. Guess what, an ape can't do it either. Then after what could have only been hours after the apes escaped, the police were already all organized on horseback and in helicopters and in cars with machine guns, road blocking the bridge and ready to massacre an army of apes at will. Yeah, right. Give me a break.Nevertheless, this is a really fun movie and the inside jokes that refer to the original movie are great. And as I said, the special effects alone make this movie deserving of a score of 7--it's just too bad the writing wasn't better because this could have been a perfect 10.",7,2,7,6 August 2011
The Theory of Everything," Average Love Story, Below Average Hawking Biography
","Finally finished watching The Theory of Everything last night. It's a pretty good movie, worth watching, but at the same time it's a bit disappointing. The title of the movie suggests that more attention would be given to Hawking's actual theory, but this entire movie is about his relationship with his wife, and even in that it falls short of the sentimentality needed to carry a good love story. They get together so quickly that we really don't understand his wife's attraction to him or why she falls so deeply in love with him so immediately that she's willing to sacrifice the rest of her life taking care of a severely handicapped person. I don't mind a good love story, but then call it The Theory of Love or something. Hawking isn't portrayed as especially brilliant. Sure, there's a few scenes where he wins an award, presents his theories to his peers and receives praise, writes his famous book, but these things just happen in the film in a matter of seconds and then they are over and we're back to his wife spoon feeding him or what the next upgrade to his wheelchair is going to be. We're never really allowed inside his mind to get a sense of the brilliance that is going on. I give Eddie Redmayne huge props for pulling off the acting job that he did, but doing so within the confines of such a lazy script makes this a rather good story about a disabled person who is lucky enough to have someone who loves and cares for him, but not a good movie about Stephen Hawking.",6,3,8,22 January 2015
Gran Torino," Great Movie, Until The Last Few Minutes
","WARNING SPOILERS. This is a great great movie, until you get to the climax. Instead of doing the expected Taxi Driver thing of shooting up the bad guys, our hero decides to let the villains kill him in order to get them arrested. But one major flaw in that logic: why did they stick around to be arrested? It doesn't take a genius to understand after you fill an old man full of lead in your own front yard that you should get the heck out of there and escape. But none of them do, not a single member of the entire gang. Apparently they just sit there and wait for the police to arrive to be arrested. This is the one and only flaw in the script but it is such a major one involving the resolution of the problem that we just can't get beyond it. This is a wonderfully sentimental, moving film spoiled by a totally implausible ending. Enjoy the first 100 minutes and then say WHAT?????",9,0,4,5 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," The Badest Ass War Film Of This Millennium
","All I can say is that I hope to Christ this is the pilot for a cable drama because I would watch it week after week, religiously. This has to be the smartest, most engaging action film I've seen, jeez, I don't know, add in all the suspense and the lunacy and, well, maybe since Saving Private Ryan. Mostly The Hurt Locker centers around the main character, a Lethal Weapon type bomb expert stationed in Iraq after a tour in Afghanistan during which he disabled over 800 road side bombs. He marches on in nearly suicidally and takes on every variation of explosive imaginable. This is a cinematic gem; you won't want it to end. When it ends, you'll be all like, man, it's over, now what. Fantastic movie making. Entertainment, pure entertainment.",10,42,66,10 April 2009
Evil Dead," The Boring Dead
","I can't believe how awful the remake of The Evil Dead is. I've been waiting for it for so long and was so surprised when I found myself yawning while watching it and I almost fell asleep once. It's so incredibly NOT scary I even started heckling it toward the end. Here are its main flaws:1. The characters are not likable, especially the shaggy unpleasant dude who is completely annoying and is played by probably the worst actor on the face of the earth. The main female character is a junkie. The rest of them are just cardboard cutouts with no motivation.2. There is no build up to suspense. In the original Evil Dead all the characters were just carefree people going to a cabin to have a good time and that set up is what made what eventually happens to them so horrible in juxtaposition. But this time around they're at the cabin to help their junkie friend go cold turkey off heroin. Huh? So in other words they're already there, prepared for a bad time so when things get worse well, so what?3. The sound. The music is just horrible and relentless. Sometimes it sounds like the score from an Indiana Jones film. Other times there is this noise that sounds like a tornado siren blaring as if it's a big neon sign pointing at the screen telling us 'This part is suppose to be scary so be scared.' Also the demon voices are just a joke. Instead of being deep and menacing they sound like some little kid going 'Whooooo' in the dark pretending she's a ghost.4. This movie is just not scary and it's also not funny. For some reason they give us an opening scene involving a woman who is possessed by a demon so they sort of give it away right from the start. When other people start getting possessed we're like, right, we already saw that in the first scene. I really can't put my finger on why it's not scary. There are a few really well shot scenes where I sat there thinking, this should be really, really scary but for some reason it's not. It's boring.5. There is too much attention given to the Book of the Dead. This time around the possessed people aren't just randomly acting nuts but following instructions from the book (scald yourself in the shower, cut your face off). The film keeps showing us pages from the book once again as if we need a big arrow pointing to the screen explaining for us what's happening and why. 6. The ending is nothing like the original. In the original we are taken down the rabbit hole into shear madness and ultimately there's no escape from the evil. In this one, get this (warning spoilers ahead), the main female lead who is the first to get possessed gets buried alive then her brother digs her back up and brings her back to life through a makeshift defibrillator (um, okay) and now she's normal again then for some reason her brother goes and kills himself so that SHE becomes the last one standing against some OTHER demon woman who comes out of the ground no less and chases her around and blah blah blah and in the end she survives. The ending is total nonsense and is a formulaic climax instead of keeping to the insane, no hope spirit of The Evil Dead.7. The acting is so bad I have to wonder why they wrote in so much unnecessary dialogue since the actors could barely show a single emotion, and even the dialogue is like a big arrow pointing at the screen telling us 'This is what's happening' as if we're so stupid we can't figure it out for ourselves. At one point one character literally says something like 'I think I caused this by reading from that book' well DUH!!!8. The script is the worst script for a remake I've seen since I Spit On Your Grave. Why do they have a nail gun at the cabin in the first place? Why do they have not only an electric knife (or electricity for that matter) but also a perfectly cooked, rare beef roast of some sort that one character cuts up with the electric knife but apparently they never eat it. Shouldn't they be toasting marshmallows or something? Who is with whom anyway? Who's cabin is it? If they were going to change the script so much then why even stage it in a cabin? Why not stage it in a tiny little apartment or something?9. The film is so dark. I mean the lighting, not the atmosphere. You really have to strain to even see what's going on.10. Finally, for the life of me, I can't figure out where two of the characters even disappeared to. They were possessed then suddenly they weren't even part of the film anymore. Did I see some type of edited version or something? What happened to the dark skinned girl for example? Maybe that was the part I fell asleep in. The only things this film has going for it.1. There are a handful of really original gory scenes but you can get that with just about any straight to video horror film.2. Jane Levy proves she can do more than Suburgatory. She's by far the only real actor in the film and she does a decent job given the mixed up script plopped onto her lap.3. If you're lucky like me you can sneak into the theater next door and watch The Croods and you won't feel so ripped off.Well, that's it. That's my two cents about this stinker called Evil Dead.PS, let's hope the remake of Suspiria is better than this.",4,86,172,7 April 2013
Taken," Really Stupid But Fun As Hell
","Stupidity never stopped Rambo from being entertaining, even in the latest installment when Stallone's a wrinkled old man. In Taken we have the hilarious premise that old fart Liam Neeson can karate chop his way through an international sex slave ring without getting so much as a bruise. Guess what, it works. They did a good job of finding a stunt double that looks like Neeson because the action flows flawlessly and there are some really good John Woo moments here. There aren't many surprises, no plot twists, just a father shooting, stabbing, blowing things up and generally kicking ass in search of his kidnapped daughter who is on her way to Hostel Part 3, ala Mel Gibson in Payback. The fun is in how they don't hold back. It's a total riot to see Shindler mercilessly killing anyone who gets in his way with the emotion of the Terminator in a quest toward the completely improbable goal of finding one teenage girl in the midst of all of Europe. It's simply satisfying to see the bad guys get what they have coming. Granted, this is a really dumb movie, but even a dumb movie deserves an eight when it achieves in the goal of entertaining.",8,0,2,4 February 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Bravo! Finally A Scary Horror Movie
","I don't usually review movies here when there are already nearly 300 reviews, but I liked Drag Me To Hell a lot, so what the hell. First off, I like the title, in an I Spit On Your Grave sort of way. Secondly, I like the timeliness of it being about a woman who gets a curse put on her for foreclosing on a loan, you know, in this day and age of loan foreclosure horrors. But what I really liked is that, although it has its funny moments, its not one of your camp, stupid gory movies like the Evil Dead sequels, but instead is made to scare the hell out of you, and it does a pretty good job at it. I must say, the old gypsy woman is a great villain ranking up there with Freddy. Few movies have legitimately scared me. Let's see, there's the original Evil Dead, there's Descent about the cave exploring chicks, there's The Exorcist, there's Suspiria, Seven and Silence of the Lamb were both good and creepy, there was that Italian 'Zombie' movie with the zombie fighting a shark underwater, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (forget about all the remakes), Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978, The Thing 1982 is good for a heart attack the first time you see it, I actually liked CHUD a lot, and . . .and . . . and now there is Drag Me To Hell. It really does deserve to be ranked up there with the greats. It's really a shame that the so-called modern masters of horrors usually just make crap. I mean, look at George Ramero. What has he done since Dawn of the Dead? Nearly every Stephen King movie with the exception of Carrie and the original version of The Shining is just doo-doo. John Carpenter made a bunch of cult classics, granted, but he's also made some dogs such as Prince of Darkness. Seriously, when is the last time Wes Craven really scared you? I'm truly happy to see Sam Raimi back in action with his original genre. I hope he pumps out a bunch of good, old fashioned shock schlocks to entertain the hell out of us all.",9,2,5,14 June 2009
Invictus," Oscar Time For Morgan Freeman
","Morgan Freeman's poignant and gentle portrayal of Nelson Madela will surely earn him at least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, if not the Academy Award itself. Having spent most of his career being typecast as, you know, that black detective in all those mystery thrillers, or perhaps the president in a disaster movie, Morgan Freeman finally proves that he can act, and then some, with his rare performance in Invictus. Matt Damon, well, he is right for the part but he might as well be an extra in this Morgan Freeman film. I didn't find out until the closing credits that Invictus is directed by Clint Eastwood. Clint is a brilliant director, no doubt about it. The last half hour or so turns into a sports movie cliché but this is so easily forgiven after receiving the enjoyment of Morgan Freeman's performance. You will laugh; you will cry. Most of all, you will cheer.",10,2,4,25 December 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Hell Yeah Rock And Roll Sci Fi
","This is what Terminator Salvation should have been. Transformers 2 is like the finale of that old movie Demon Seed done for over two hours straight. Machines gone wild. Special effects galore. Fast paced action non-stop from beginning to end, at a budget of about a trillion dollars. This is epic apocalyptic old fashioned science fiction to the max. It's like a John Woo shoot out if the Asian guys were robots that turned into cars. This one is not kiddy stuff. You'll forget this is based on a Hasbro toy about thirty seconds into it when the top notch digital fireworks begin. And the kid is quite credible coming out of Eagle Eye. More action that Xmen Origins Wolverine. So many explosions you'll laugh, good ones too, big bad explosions, no kidding. Simply THE best science fiction action film since Terminator 2. Anyone who doesn't like Transformers 2 should go watch Monster Ball or something and leave the rest of us alone to appreciate the fine art of the action film.",10,7,16,23 June 2009
The Witch," Pointless and not very successful exercise in mood
","I was highly disappointed by The Witch. I just don't understand why independent horror films keep failing to scare me these days. The closest anything has come to scaring me in recent years is perhaps Babadook and Goodnight Mommy, but even those fell a little short of their potential. In this one we have a handful of creepy scenes that are completely wasted, because this film so lacks anything resembling a plot that that's all they come across as, just random scenes.OK, here we go, I'll try to explain it (spoiler warning). A family is for some reason exiled from an early 17th century New England town, so they go off and find a spot to live on their own, but they don't seem to know how to grow or hunt for food. The family isn't properly introduced to us in the first place, so it's a little confusing (is there one or two families living together) but soon we figure out it's just one family with a lot of kids. They all talk like Shakespearean characters so it's hard to identify with them. One day the little baby vanishes in thin air and apparently there's some old witch living out in the woods who took him and I guess, ate him or something. From then on nothing is explained. The witch does make another appearance, but she's just a flash and she never becomes a character in this story, is never explained whatsoever. The older boy disappears in the woods and when he returns he's possessed, I guess, or maybe he's just sick and delusional. I don't know. The older daughter and the younger set of twins then start accusing each other of being witches because their goat gives blood instead of milk, while the mother thinks she's breast feeding her baby when really a crow is pecking on her. The father chops a lot of wood in at least four or five scenes of him chopping wood. Their goat then becomes murderous and everyone goes nuts and the girl discovers that the goat is Lucifer himself, I guess, and he tempts the girl to sign her name in his book and she goes off into the woods to float around in the sky with the other witches.The end.",4,7,18,20 February 2016
The Blind Side," Not Bad For What It Is
","Okay, The Blind Side may be based on truth, but it is still a hokey story about a rich Republican who adopts a black ghetto boy. That being the case, that this is one of those movies, The Blind Side is still a really good example of the genre. Sandra Bullock has really matured as an actress and without her playing the powerfully willed woman who takes a million chances and has unyielding faith, this movie would be nothing at all. That is not to say that the rest of the actors weren't cast well; the casting is perfect. But Bullock is the show and that's all there is to it. The Blind Side is long and drawn out at over two hours, but ultimately it is satisfying and not boring. The Blind Side is more about the relationships between human beings than it is a sports movie, so if you are hoping for a lot of exciting football scenes this one won't deliver. Instead it is like a really well made, sentimental Lifetime movie. It works on all levels and is safe for the entire family. I think the foulest word in the entire movie is 'penis'. I have to score this one and eight simply for the love it delivers. I'd like to see more movies about love. Love is a tough subject to tackle but The Blide Side does a good job at it.",8,0,0,21 December 2009
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A Mixed Bag of Tricks
","Kingsman is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's just a British rehash of XXX (or any other 007 ripoff / parody). On the other hand, there are a few scenes in it that truly tread the waters of cult classic (the fantastic church massacre being one of them). Too bad these scenes are floating around in an overly long, sometimes dull spy caper with an identity crisis. It doesn't know if it wants to be serious or if it wants to be funny, and the result is that it ends up being neither. Samuel L. Jackson gives the worst performance of his career as the villain, doing a horrible Flava Flav (with a lisp) impersonation, with an implausible evil plot to destroy the human population that world leaders are going along with for no logical reason whatsoever. And his side-kick with the knives for legs; well, if you've seen the previews you've already seen that so it's no great surprise and there isn't any more Robert Rodriguez shtick other than that in case you were wondering. It's like they took Divergent or any number of teeny bopper films and put it in an R-rated bag full of James Bond and tossed in a few Tarantino spices and shook it up and tossed it out hoping what came out was a great film. What came out was not a bad film. I watched it from beginning to end and forgave it for the cheesy special effects. But it's something you'll probably want to wait to watch on your home entertainment system, because I didn't feel it was worth the $12.50 I paid to see it. And, no, it's not ultra violent at all. The violence is very cartoonish and the blood is computer generated so, eh, I wasn't really impressed.",6,4,10,13 February 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," If You Like Chewing Bubblegum This Is For You
","Okay, right, the plot is confusing. Okay, right, the acting doesn't amount to more than some screaming and yelling and macho poses. Okay, the most absurd casting in the history of film was made by putting British supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in the role of the main lead and love interest. She slides down collapsing buildings, runs though explosions with shrapnel flying everywhere, crawls through burning pits of smoky ash, and doesn't so much as smudge her white sweater or show a single emotion besides sticking out her big pouty lips and speaking a few lines as if lobotomized. But besides all of this, Transformers 3 is pure bubblegum, two and a half hours of explosions and robot violence with at least an hour of Chicago getting attacked that rivals the destruction in any other movie. What do you expect from yet another sequel to a movie based on Hasbro toys? Clint Eastwood giving Meryl Streep a bouquet of fleshly picked flowers? If you want action and over the top special effects this movie is top notch, but if you expect anything else, why go see a movie called Transformers 3 in the first place? I thought it was a lot of fun.",7,0,2,3 July 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," One Of The Worst Vigilante Movies Ever Made
","I guess every actor sooner or later finds himself in the position that Denzel Washington found himself in with 'Fallen' and 'Law Abiding Citizen' is certainly Jamie Foxx's low point. I was looking forward to this because I thought it was going to be a drama about an 'every day guy' (as advertised) taking the law into his own hands after his family is brutally murdered, but instead it turned out to be about an unbelievable super spook somehow wreaking vengeance on all the wrong people in a truly ridiculous, boring and uninspired tale of misguided revenge. Gerard Butler's interpretation of Anthopny Hopkins in Fracture or Kevin Spacey in Seven only kept the momentum going for a little while until the completely absurd plot took over. This is one of those movies where you are expected to suspend your disbelief indefinitely but unfortunately, the nagging question lingers that if this guy is able to concoct and exact such elaborate plots from a solitary confinement prison cell, then why couldn't he defend his own wife and child in his own home to begin with. Silly, stupid, and a waste of time. Let's hope Jamie Foxx holds out for something better next time.",4,37,61,19 October 2009
