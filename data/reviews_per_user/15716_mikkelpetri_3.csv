Skyfall," Thats James Bond
","This is the third James Bond movie with Daniel Craig as Bond, and i must saw wow, this movie delivers action from the first scene to the last. But with that said, i must say that after my opinion, neither Skyfall or Quantum of solace could live up to the first one Casino Royal! Yes, they are pretty good, but Casino Royal was after my opinion fantastic, the best Bond movie ever made.. It's very cool that they got the original Bond car in this one, and many old Bond characteristics are used in Skyfall as well, so that's great! I love Daniel Craig, he's a wonderful actor, he delivers in every movie he's in, defiantly the best Bond ever, according to me! So if you haven't seen this movie yet, you got something to do on your list, you will not be disappointed! I will give this movie 8-10 stars!",8,0,9,10 November 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Worth watching
","Normally i'm not the big fan of Twilight, but my mom forced me to watch them, and so I did. Kristen Stewart was not my cup of tea, I found her very annoying and even though I properly knew that her character was suppose to be this way, it made me look at these movies and say, this is crap... But I saw the last Twilight movie yesterday and i must say that Kristen really surprised me very positively! Her character was totally different, and suddenly i realized something that changed my views on these films completely! The Bella role was meant to be sad, shy, and quiet.. But when she turns into a vampire herself, all the beauty and happiness gets out! So it all led to this, the was suppose to be a little different from normal girls in the other movies, so that she could really shine in this one! It worked so good, and I was blown away! But one thing that I don't get is the special effects... They are so bad... I don't understand why everything has to look like one big green screen shot, it's so awful to look at! But all in all, great movie, especially if you are a real Twilight fan, i'm not a fan, but it still blew me away, so if you haven't seen it yet, go do it! It will not disappoint you!",9,4,11,24 November 2012
Sinister," Great Horror Movie!
","I must say, this is really a great horror movie! Don't listen to all the bad reviews, if you like movies such as Insidious, you will not be disappointed! I believe that some people, even without watching the film, gets the wrong impression of it.. maybe because they are not into Paranormal Activity, but let me be clear on this, this movie is nothing like Paranormal Activity! If you are the kind of person who just loves movies who gets more and more terrifying, then you should go see this, you will not be let down! And the acting in Sinister is also brilliant! Believe me, you will jump in your seat during this film, thats for sure. So as a conclusion i will give this movie 9/10 stars!",9,15,23,9 November 2012
