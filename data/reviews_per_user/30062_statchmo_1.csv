The Devil's Advocate," Big Time Stinker.....Don't Waste Your Time
","Without a doubt one of the dumbest movies I have ever had the misfortune to see.  Only thing more offensive than the idiotic storyline, gratuitous nudity/sex, & excruciatingly slow pace was the sight of all that money up on the screen (Pacino, Reeves, monstrously luxurious sets) being wasted. After the first 20 minutes, I was ready to turn the damn thing off.  I managed to stick it out for another hour before I resorted to the fast forward button.  How could actors of Pacino & Reeves' calibre be sucked into something this bad?  At least Pacino looked like he was enjoying himself; Reeves' continual expression could only be interpreted as 'what the hell am I doing in this lame-ass movie?'  And the ending...!  Well, suffice it to say that we've all seen it before---on 'Dallas' & other low-rent t.v. shows. Dumb, dumb, dumb.  This movie's worst sin?---it's not even entertaining.",Null,1,3,9 January 1999
