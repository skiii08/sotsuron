Alien 3," Too bad about the script
","Great direction.  David Fincher's first film, and he did quite well considering, but the script was 100% awful, a piece of crap from beginning to end.  It completely ruins its predecessor, 'Aliens,' and was clearly only made to make a quick buck.Fun to watch, but this movie is not a sequel.  It's like an interesting nightmare Ripley had on her way to... wherever.",7,402,421,17 October 1999
Requiem for a Dream," Brace Yourself.
","Powerful, disturbing, unmistakably accurate, and impossible to look away from.  I was so disgusted by the depths these characters would sink to, I couldn't even tell if this was a good movie or not.Eventually, I had to realize, anything which could affect its viewer with that much intensity, is no mistake.  'American Beauty' affected me and left me with an odd feeling of joy and wonder-- 'Requiem' left me depressed and more than a little untrusting of my fellow man.  I won't watch it again anytime soon, but I think I'm glad I saw it at least once.  Brace yourself.",9,0,0,13 December 2000
Sucker Punch," What If You Spent $50 Million on a CGI Man Taking a Dump?
","It's kind of difficult to comment on the movie, without just writing, 'Terrible,' and clicking the submit button. To write a good comment, one must write WHY it is terrible... but where to begin? If someone came into your home, and defecated in the middle of your living room, would you need to explain in a calm manner, three reasons why the person was wrong for doing such a deed? No. You'd toss them by their ear out onto the street, left with the unenviable task of having to clean up. Perhaps you'd even call the police.If, on the other hand, you spent $50 million (or whatever the budget was; it was too high, in any event) to have someone take a CGI dump in your living room... is that any better? There are three actors in this movie: Scott Glenn, Jena Malone, and Carla Gugino. Four, if you count Jon Hamm, but he's not in the movie long enough to matter. There are these three, and everything else is there to talk until it's time for another special effect. Jena Malone isn't even required to do any of these things, but because she has actual experience as an actress, bothered to create a character and reflect an emotional state during the 'story.' Everyone else just showed up, put on the costumes, and talked until the director said 'cut.' Vanessa Hudgens should have been a clue.Even if the story is awful, unmemorable, or predictable (Suckerpunch is all three), other Hollywood movies may rely on memorable action sequences or visuals. In a movie roughly 100 minutes long, these action sequences take up roughly five minutes of screen time. Then Snyder detonates an explosive in New York. Again.It's not so much that Zack Snyder hates audiences, it's just that he's incredibly naive, like a 12-year-old suddenly given the keys to his dads liquor cabinet. He wants you to like a character, he makes them female and puts them in a low-cut top. He wants you to hate a character, he makes that character a rapist or molester of children. He does this again and again; these appear in every movie he's ever made, save for his first (and best) film, 'Dawn of the Dead,' which was written by someone else entirely. Someone who understands subtlety and character development. Realize, too, that I'm saying this about a movie where a smarmy rich dude accidentally chainsaws his most recent sexual partner.Whatever fancy visuals made it to the trailer, the movie is this: Zack Snyder wrote a script with his camera-man, and it is neither funny nor exciting. It's a 100-minute demo reel, and considering this is his fifth movie, he really should have actually created something with weight, by this point.I'm not going to call the police, but I am going to be mad for a week, because even though I've cleaned my floor, the smell lingers on. 3/10.",3,130,272,25 March 2011
Ali," Skipped Parts
","Will Smith has charm and grace, but little else as far as acting chops, so it surprised me when he nailed this role so beautifully.  It's a damn shame they didn't put that performance in a better film.I'm in a train car riding by Ali's life.  The same detached storytelling technique was used in Oliver Stone's 'Born on the Fourth of July,' and while Tom Cruise was nominated for an Oscar for that film as well, both films left me feeling worn out and bewildered.  Huge chunks of the stories were left out, and while some may deem that as acceptable because the subjects were so larger-than-life, I demand more from a film.  Others have tried and succeeded before.I didn't live through this historical era, but in addition to the above criticisms, from an aesthetic standpoint, I can say that Mario Van Peebles has the charisma of a wet noodle, and the ending left a lot to be desired.There's a little Epilogue before the closing credits roll, and I want to know more about THAT.  So Ali lost and regained his title in the late 1970's; does the movie make an effort to show why they're showing the Foreman fight and not the one ten years later?  These are events I want to know about, even if the significance of them is something less than One Man standing against the Vietnam War.Ali the man is significant enough.  6/10.",6,0,1,1 May 2002
Catch Me If You Can," Blessed Return to Normalcy
","A good story.  Not nearly as pretentious, overblown or intellectually devoid as, say, everything Spielberg has directed since 1994.It still has its flaws, and I'm wondering if ol' Spielberg chose to focus on the father-son relationship a little more than other important aspects of Abagnale's life... or if he's just showing his lack of ability to direct actors.  I know, I know, that's blasphemy... but the parents in 'A.I.' and the modern-day old people scenes in 'Saving Private Ryan' were just SO bad, I have to wonder if he picked Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen for 'CMIYC' because a) They wanted to work with him badly, or b) They wouldn't require the direction of someone less experienced or less accomplished. Sound fishy?  Explain the parents in 'A.I.'  Switched loyalties like some people switch channels........As for 'Catch Me,' it's a cute, breezy film, with very few flaws.  The most glaring:a) Jennifer Garner's one scene makes absolutely no sense, it's a non-sequitur.  If she'd turned out to be an undercover agent, that would have been something.  Instead, she just shows up, pulls money from her bra, and is gone again.  I felt violated, like I just watched a plug for her television show in the middle of an otherwise fun movie.  She obviously wasn't a prostitute because Frank says he recognizes her... I never did understand the fascination with this actress (assuming any actually exists).b) Brenda Strong, and her father, played by Martin Sheen.  Once they exit the film, they are never mentioned again.  They're set up to be fairly important in Frank's life, and I'm left wondering what became of them / Frank's relationship with them.  This isn't a plot hole, so much as a huge gaping annoyance.  Perhaps Spielberg is getting senile; no, it's not the screenwriter's fault, the director should be able to look at the script and go, 'Hey, Jeff, what happens to characters X, Y and Z?'Beyond that: cute, breezy and worth seeing at least twice, so you can put it all together and admire some of the DP's camerawork (which alternates between the fancy and the mundane).  Kudos to Nathanson/Spielberg for giving it a fourth and fifth act, and giving us that much more about Abagnale's life.Flawed, but only a few film geeks will notice.  It gets an A from me, your opinion may vary.  9/10.",9,1,1,29 December 2002
The Ring," I Am Now Terrified of my Own Phone.
","This movie scared the bejeezus out of me.The one point I'll grant is that Blair Witch kinda wigged me a little too, and about 50% of America, it seems, hated that flick.  So I don't know where everyone else comes down on the U.S. remake of 'The Ring.'  But, ahem, it scared the bejeezus out of ME.Gore Verbinski is just the Man.  'The Mexican' was well-paced and clever (I don't care what you say; the character, tone and script were well-thought out and original, which America abhors next to, say, anything with J.Lo. in it).  'Mouse Hunt' was cute, original and visually interesting, for a kids film (which the Harry Potter films were not, history will prove me right). This one, just, wow.  The imagery, the pacing, the way he respects silence, the tone, the filmmakers have always got one more surprise in their back pocket, right up until the credits roll...The whole opening scene does it.  'AH! She's closing the fridge, is their something behind the door?!' to 'WHY is the camera framing the stairs as she walks up them, what are THEY gonna do..?!'Drove me crazy.  Had me wound up tighter than a Network Exec during sweeps week.  And it will be SO much scarier on video.  In fact, I refuse to watch it on video.  The phone might ring.The one weak point is Brian Cox.  Great character actor, but he's also the most famous face in this film, so I don't buy him for a second as the guy he's supposed to be playing.  So the scenes he's in are ruined; the film is not.I shudder to think how the original could be scarier... just to be safe, though, I think I won't watch it.  10/10.",10,0,0,24 December 2002
Unbreakable," Are you Unbreakable?
","A very clever film from a very clever director.  Like David Fincher, here's a man who gets better with each film he makes, and this film does not disappoint.  It grabbed my attention and never let go, it was scary, funny, fascinating all the way to the very end.At this early date, it's impossible to know if the public will accept the film as they did 'The Sixth Sense.'  Director Fincher achieved huge success with 'Seven' then made 'The Game' and 'Fight Club,' both of which are incredible films, but didn't make money.Whether or not Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' makes money is of no consequence to me, a watcher of as many movies as possible.  It's an incredible film, like something Kevin Smith might have once thought of, but will never be dramatic enough to pull off.  See it, and hopefully it'll make you think a little deeper, too... like 'Wide Awake,' and like 'The Sixth Sense.'",8,0,1,22 November 2000
Fight Club," Oops. Fincher did it again.
","People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden.  It's not that we look alike, or anything-- it's just that the very idea behind the existence of Mr. Durden is one of angst, of loss, of mass confusion of what exactly Males are supposed to be as we enter the 21st century.  For thousands, or tens of thousands of years, we were hunters, fierce warriors who stalked and killed our prey to feed our families and tribes; we fought for and defended our families, our communities, our ways of life.  These days, we stay up late watching infomercials, and spend time abusing the copy machine at work. Ain't progress grand?Hollywood makes movies that appeal to the largest common denominator, and clearly this movie is not for everyone.  (Though in 40 years, it might be-- Hitchcock movies bombed in their own decades, too.  Figure that one out). But ideally, it appeals to those of us who are lost, those of us who didn't even know how bad things had gotten-- how good it can be for the soul to just punch someone in the face every now and then.HOWEVER-- that doesn't mean punching someone is right.  This User Comment, and this film, do not advocate violence.  But the idea behind it, we are told, is something worth just thinking about... so we may factor it into our lives, and our future, to know ourselves and form a conclusion based on the whole, not by denying Who We Are.  If you prefer your movies idea-free, then back off this one and go rent 'Navy SEALS.'  I hear Charlie Sheen is very good in that.Here, knock-you-OUT performances from Brad 'I'm so pretty they'll never give me an Oscar, but they SHOULD' Pitt, and the just as perfectly cast Edward 'I transcend your foolish award system' Norton.  Stimulated with conversation, this movie should hopefully affect you in positive ways, to at least make you think about what it's trying to say, whether you agree with it or not. Some parts are hilarious.  Some parts are difficult to watch.  I hope you can say the same about your own life.And then Kenneth Turan of the L.A. Times writes, '... a witless mishmash of whiny, infantile philosophizing and bone-crunching violence that actually thinks it's saying something of significance.'  It is saying something significant, Kenneth, to everyone except you.  And with your cushy little high-paying job as a FILM CRITIC, I guess you don't have any reason to find fault with your life, do you?  Is that what a man looks like?We look forward to your return, Mr. Durden.10/10",10,3,8,11 February 2001
Shakespeare in Love," A Very Well-Read film
","It's a shame that any living person would ever look at this movie and think it to be overrated.  Upon second viewing, I was even more overjoyed that this film was lucky enough to win Best Picture, for it proves the Academy really does pay attention.As a movie, perhaps not everyone can love this film, but if you've actually read any Shakespeare, even just a little bit, the film seems that much more clever.  The more Shakespeare you know, the more references in the film you're going to get, and the more impressed you're going to be.It's an interesting hybrid, in the days of Post-Modernism when more movies are just referencing other movies.  But as the intelligentsia of the theatre continues to invade cinema-- American Beauty, Titus-- it shows that 'clever' is not dead in the movies.History will decide.10/10",10,0,1,3 January 2000
12 Monkeys," Brad Pitt can ACT
","There are lots of other reviews on this film, but I just had to state one thing... which is that Brad Pitt absolutely deserved an Academy Award for this film.  I thought he was a pretty-boy annoying actor until I watched his performance here, and it was unlike any other I have seen.He did not win in 1995... he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and lost to Kevin Spacey for The Usual Suspects.The Usual Suspects was an excellent film.  It won an Oscar for its screenplay.  But Spacey won his award because no one guessed the ending before its time... which is not inherently the work of an actor, but of the script working so very well.  Spacey wasn't playing Soze playing Kint... he was just playing Kint.Brad Pitt is playing a psycho, but not JUST a psycho... a subtly nuanced psycho, so you can see all that is going on in his head... he's got different levels, and is thus more real than Verbal Kint or Keyser Soze can ever be.And scarier too.Bruce Willis and Madeline Stowe also give A+ performances, and you should see this film if you're up for a head trip.  That was all I wanted to say.",9,0,1,17 September 1999
Oldboy," 'The Definition of Wisdom is that You Can Still Be Shocked'
","I'm not really interested in hearing from the people attacking this movie, because it's readily apparent from their comments that they didn't even watch it after the first couple of minutes-- like one who listens to a song without actually hearing it. This is one of two movies I've ever seen people walk out of during a particularly graphic scene-- this is different from someone walking out of a movie because it's out-and-out bad. In a terrible film, people just give up and walk out at any random point (which I've done, too). Something is effective and effectual if you walk out not just because something graphic is happening on screen, but because you emotionally connect with it, and it rattles you. Violence on film, without context, isn't rattling-- it's boring.'Oldboy' will rattle you, and I'm sure there's no shortage of reactionary folk who will call it disgusting, offensive, horrid, blah blah blah. Maybe they're right, but it doesn't make this a bad film. You can't look away.Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped in the film's opening moments, and then held in what looks to be a hotel room (with fortified door and fake window) for fifteen years. This is a 21st Century noir folks, bad things happen. If you're expecting the mainstream violence of a Denzel Washington or Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, stay home. If you're not emotionally involved with this married man, father of a daughter, in the first few minutes, the movie is not for you. It's hard, it's harsh, and though the graphic violence (read: blood) is subdued to keep it in R-territory, it's the psychological power that will grab you by the throat. It's the psychological terror that makes 'The Ring' (minus the otherworldly) terrifying, and made 'The Blair Witch Project' so deeply unsettling. Again, if you disagree that those movies were scary, you won't like 'Oldboy.' I can think of no other way to define it.These are psychologically, emotionally, physically scarred characters. You will travel with them and experience every moment, see things you didn't want to see (not of the blood variety) and learn thing you don't want to learn. If you're ready to go along, then buy a ticket and step inside. If you're not so sure, then I'm sure Denzel Washington will have another movie coming along shortly. Whom I like, but we all know Denzel is going to be okay when the closing credits roll. 10/10, though your mileage may vary.",10,11,98,23 April 2005
Spider-Man 2," An Open Letter to Sam Raimi
","Dear Mr. Raimi,You may not remember this, but a few years back I wrote you another open letter here, FURIOUS at the terrible piece of filmmaking, of writing, of sheer BEING that was the original 'Spider-Man.'  It relied too heavily on CGI, it insulted my intelligence, it had gaping holes in its own logic... and then there was that Macy Gray cameo.  Yech.Mr. Raimi, props to you sir, PROPS.  I didn't think you even read that thing.  But you listened, and you responded.  You jettisoned screenwriter David Koepp, whose screenplays were always sensational, but typically dumb as rocks.  You hired Oscar-winner Alvin Sargent to write your screenplay, and hired your old cinematographer Tim Pope, from your Army of Darkness days, to shoot your movie.The special effects were subtle and you focussed on the story.  Character took precedence over choking your audience on CGI.  The story had five recognizable acts, and each character was given their chance to shine.Yes, you brought everyone back, and found something for them to do.  Timid Tobey Maguire, Emotionally Conflicted Kirsten Dunst... you even had the courage to bring back James Franco, even though it's now apparent his career is going nowhere.  A bold step, but you make it work for you.  I'm talking about the ending.  You know what I mean.You could've gone with a big star for Doc Ock, but instead you picked a great ACTOR, one who was right for the part-- the superb Alfred Molina.  And then you let him ACT, rather than hiding him with effects the entire movie-- much like Willem Dafoe in the first film.I had low expectations for this film, but you blew me through the back wall of the theater.  You CAN direct a summer blockbuster, you CAN strike an excellent balance between action and drama.  You know when to restrain yourself (excellent use of silence), and you know when to just let it fly (the scene on the train almost made me cry).  This is what happens when a director and writer are MORE talented than their actors.  It doesn't happen a lot, but this film made me proud to be your fan.  Even the opening credits were supremely clever, showing us the highlights of the first film so we didn't have to sit through that garbage ever again.Topping yourself for a 'Spider-Man 3' is not going to be easy.  Some filmmakers might even be tempted to take a step backward.  Some might say it's never even been pulled off, ever-- witness Superman III, Batman Returns, Alien3 or The Godfather Pt. III.  All were sad disappointments compared to what came before... but after seeing 'Spider-Man 2,' I believe. I believe, Mr. Raimi, and I know you can follow your own creative talents and create an even better, more impressive third film, given the time and people with whom to collaborate.Just don't write it.  Know where your talent lies... and where people like Alvin Sargent and Bill Pope (and Michael Chabon) can help make you the best filmmaker you can possibly be.Warmest Personal Regards,10/10",10,0,1,24 July 2004
Billy Elliot," Follow your Dreams
","An incredible, inspiring film, with one simple message-- whereever our lives may take us, no matter what may happen or what hardships we might face, our children are our future, and we must never lose sight of them.Our dreams may seem a little more out of reach as we get older, but the potential of a child is infinite.10/10",10,3,4,3 December 2000
Spice World," Did the filmmakers even TRY?
","Just because they made a movie about the Spice Girls doesn't mean it will automatically be good.  In fact, this movie is so bad I couldn't even find stuff to make fun of.  It's also living proof that the filmmakers could have released anything, no matter how bad, and Spice Girls fans still would have turned out on droves to see it.Which is exactly what the filmmakers did.  Kind of scary, really.",1,3,8,15 August 1999
The Others," Real Scary!
","A very clever, dark, moody little period piece (are the 1940's a 'period' yet?) that was scary, intense, and very, very well written.  Well-directed, too, but most people don't notice that, especially not Hollywood.The characters were very well done, and that's where the focus was, as in 'The Sixth Sense.'  The difference here is, that movie had more eye candy, and more frequently... most viewers might get bored with 'The Others,' although I certainly didn't.  I was riveted, from start to finish. Well-acted, too, all around.  Here's hoping Nicole Kidman keeps getting the good jobs.  And those kids too, and let's not leave out Mrs. Mills.  Great characters, great acting.I have to wonder if I'll enjoy it as much on second viewing, or third or fourth, like 'The Sixth Sense.'  I can't really say for sure, but it was a great time at the theater, and it will be a great time at home on video, during a dark and/or stormy night.  Bring a date.  And eagerly await all the future films from the Spanish writer/director, already famous elsewhere in the world, and now, give him the change to make a dent on YOUR psyche.High on mood, and scare-factor.  I don't remember a single bit of gore, which is a rarity in modern horror movies-- though this isn't horror, it's definitely more psychological.  But psychological is tough to fit in movie ads, so we're left with... just a really entertaining film, on all levels. Also a rarity in Hollywood!",9,0,0,26 August 2001
Troy," Y'Know, for an 'Epic,' They Sure Did Spend a Lot of Time on That One Beach
","Epic (n.) 1) An extended narrative poem in elevated or dignified language, celebrating the feats of a legendary or traditional hero.Personally, I'd define an epic FILM as being huge in scale, scope and size, something most of the '10' voters for this film apparently haven't ever seen.  This can be anything at all, kids.  'The Bridge on the River Kwai,' from so many years ago.  Even as recent as 'The English Patient,' or the directors cut of 'The Abyss.'  It can and does exist, with dozens of characters, places and events.'Troy' does not fit any of these categories.  Nine-tenths of the film take place in one of two locations (the walls of Troy, or the beach next to it), and the numerous characters speak in wooden, clunky dialogue that was so un-memorable, I couldn't even recall any from the time I saw it, to the time I'm typing this.  And the theater wasn't that far of a drive.Brad Pitt?  Yeah, he's pretty.  Peter O'Toole?  Great actor, but you can't win an Oscar when you only have six lines.  Most of the actors (save the gorgeous but one-note Diane Kruger) held their own, too, but they weren't given much to do.  Director Wolfgang Peterson is one of the few living directors who COULD deliver an epic, but the entire film collapses under the weight of a boring, paint-by-numbers script riddled with cliches and predictibility.  Want to know who's going to die next?  List the above-the-title actors in order from Most Famous to Least Famous, and start at the bottom.Yes, it's very pretty; lots of money was spent and evidently we're all still impressed by computer-generated armies.  Lots of people will go see this movie and think it's great, and then forget about it by June.  There's really no reason to see this except it's trendy the week of May 14th, 2004-- it's structured and written like an over-budgeted Soap Opera, from a screenwriter who didn't exist before last year and probably won't after this year.  Seriously.  Check his credits.Nothing at all interesting or surprising here, except the ending... at least for me, cuz I actually read 'The Iliad.'  If you didn't, then at least compare it to all the epics since, and rent one of those instead.",6,2,4,15 May 2004
X-Men," Good the First Time Around
","Marching orders for the director: Make an entertaining, action-heavy live-action version of the X-Men comic book.  Spend a lot of money on costumes, make-up, and even more on special effects.  Be true to the comic book as much as possible.  And above all, take it seriously.What's really amazing is that director Bryan Singer succeeds, but the movie is still not the A+ adaptation that was possible.  'Batman' gave us the kind of re-invented, action-packed movie we were really after.  And X-Men, while a very, very good film, is by no means a GREAT film.  The only reason I can conceive of is just that Singer is no better than his script.  The screenplay for 'The Usual Suspects' won an Oscar, and it was a great film. The screenplay for 'Apt Pupil' was amateurish and not at all thought out or researched, and the result was a below average film.  'Public Access' made little sense to me, either.Future generations may have their own opinion of this movie (or none at all), but it's nice to see someone made a decent movie out of these historical characters.  Considering the alternative ('Spawn'-- whoops), I've gotta give these guys an A for effort, but their movie's a B.8/10",8,0,0,16 January 2001
Zodiac," Fincher vs. the Police Procedural
","Few directors have name recognition these days, and even fewer directed their first film in or after the Clinton administration. But David Fincher is a household name in some circles, his visual style in unmistakable and unequalled, and some might say, he can do no wrong.The biggest problem with 'Zodiac' is that if it were a book (and it is), it would be in the True Crime section of you local bookstore. Books of this type sell very well, but I've never been a big fan. This film is essentially a police procedural, with not one protagonist but two-- Jake Gyllenhaal's Robert Graysmith disappears for huge stretches as the story focuses on Mark Ruffalo's Inspector Toschi, and his attempts (with Anthony Edwards' Inspector Armstrong) to track down the titular killer. Is it riveting to watch? Absolutely. Is Fincher's visual style evident in every frame? I think so, yes... you can't look away. Early in the film, Ruffalo looks out at late 1960's San Francisco, as a fire truck drives down the street toward him. Everything behind Ruffalo is 100% computer generated, and it's as gorgeous as anything to come out of that era of film-making. The attention to detail is mesmerizing.The question for the story is, would I watch it again? Probably not, but you can't have everything. 'Fight Club,' 'The Game,' 'Panic Room' are films I own and can watch over and over. 'Alien3' and 'Se7en' every once in a while. 'Zodiac' is a fictionalized story from a non-fiction book, and though the human element is what pulls you in throughout the film, and the characters are all people I was fascinated to hang out with for nearly 3 hours... the story is still what it is, and while well-told, doesn't reveal anything new. Bonus points for style and some outstanding casting, but as for rewatchability... I'm not so sure. Time will tell.",9,1,5,3 March 2007

Brilliant (award winning) production design, costumes, and the acting is so/so, despite only Ricci and Depp being given actual characters to play.

Silent Hill," Freaky Enough to Make Me Happy. Sequel, Please.
","The early reviews are already in, and it's absolutely no surprise that all these aging, mostly white, mostly male film 'critics' are tearing into this movie for making no sense. I take their word on the film no more than I would take that of my parents. It isn't for them.'Silent Hill' is a horror movie, but not the kind most of us are used to; where the Big Scary Deformed Killer spends 90 minutes slashing up teens. If this film has any cinematic precursor (other than the games, which are very cinematic on their own), it would be 'The Exorcist' ... where the film isn't a constant onslaught of fear or images, but has several valleys and peaks on its way to a climax that is more emotionally powerful than visually stunning (though I think SH might have done both... though the result is far, far less powerful than The Exorcist).The audience isn't supposed to know what is happening any more than the characters do. The audience is not supposed to know what these things are, where they are, what they see. I was a bit annoyed that the two female leads (Rose and Cybil) didn't communicate more once they realized what they were facing, and more so that whatever terrifying image Rose would see, she would be completely emotionally recovered in the very next scene. There was zero growth to her character, which means she isn't the protagonist. Unless she = us, but that's if you're reaching.Despite these trifles, and despite a staggeringly weak ending, the meat of the film is terrifying and creepier than any CGI-effect or masked killer. I haven't played the games, merely asked a lot of questions in the weeks before the films release-- and I still had no trouble understanding anything before me, or at least understanding it as well as the very confused lead characters.'Silent Hill' is a vision of Hell that is more real and compelling than anything I've ever seen... though admittedly, I'm not a 50-something fat white guy who writes movie reviews for a living. Thank God.",8,2,4,24 April 2006
Final Destination 2," Not Unlike Porn: No Logic, No Story, Just Money Shots
","This is not a good movie.I went through other comments, and all that, and most of the 'pro' comments seem to call it watchable, scary, gory, suspenseful... and the opening traffic accident is all of these things, but it fades away the instant this scene ends and the movie has to rely on its actors. It's not that they're bad, they're just under-directed, and stuck with a screenplay that has moments like, say, a character picks his jacket up, knocks a pool-ball to the floor, which rolls to a mousetrap, which snaps and flings the ball up into he air, knocking loose a suspended kayak, which swings loose and nearly kills someone. 'Should have seen that coming,' says the movie's most experienced character... Is that supposed to be a funny line? Seen that coming HOW, exactly? By watching out for pool balls? Not unlike Friday the 13th Part... I dunno, say, VII: The New Blood, this is NOT a good movie.I'm defining 'good movie' as something with character, a plot, and a conflict which must be resolved. The first one had these things. But 'FD2' is structured like a porno-- the writers clearly got together beforehand and came up with each 'action' sequence, then cobbled together some terrible talking-scenes to hold them together. What saved this movie from being straight-to-video, I'd wager, is that the action scenes come off pretty well. Only half of them are clever or original, all are well staged and photographed, but what comes between them pales in comparison to 'Mimic 2' or 'Leprechaun 4: In Space.' Director David Ellis, who is about as competent as the director of 'The Fly II,' must be the best liar in the world. 'In this scene,' he must have told an actor, 'There's smoldering remains next to you, but don't show grief or horror, we'll work that out in editing.' At least in the first one Devon Sawa was a good enough actor to pass off his lack of grief as growing madness. Here the actors just say the lines and move from scene-to-scene making no sense or logic, just chess pieces (well, checkers pieces) awaiting the next gore scene. And by the way-- the first film? The emphasis was on suspense, not blood.The first film was something interesting and clever (and cool) from writers of 'The X-Files.' Here, the writing is embarrassingly incompetent, there's as much tension as a trip to the mailbox, and the director blew 80% of his budget on two scenes, and suddenly he's A-List for ten minutes. It won't last; the final twenty seconds of the film were the only cheer-worthy moments. Something else it has in common with 'The Fly II' ... which shows you the kind of raw talent we're working with here. Car crash-- 9/10. Rest of film-- 1/10. Subtract a point for completely wasting Tony Todd, leaves us with 4/10.",4,1,2,11 February 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," An Excuse to Hang Out in Vegas
","It's been about 48 hours now since I saw 'Ocean's Thirteen.' I saw it with a group of people (the only way to see a movie), and the movie took so long to get going, I really got the impression that my friends were hating it. The theater didn't laugh very often, I laughed less, and when the lights came up, my friends told me what a good movie it was. 'Definitely better than the second,' they said.I disagreed, but it took me a while to figure out why. 'O13' isn't bad, per se, and I didn't really hate it while I was watching it, though it did take a while for it to get going. I think, ultimately, the reason the first movie was so good, was because it was fun, funny, and witty, but still knew the difference between 'when to be funny' and 'when to not be funny.' Andy Garcia's character was dangerous, and treated as such. The situations were potentially dangerous, and you got the sense of real peril for the characters. You knew what was at stake. It was a real movie, and just as good on repeat viewings, due to a really original and fresh approach (as well as some great one-liners).The second movie wasn't reviewed nearly as well, and having watched it again since, it's really not bad either, except for the huge and sudden changes in tone throughout, as well as the fact that it pulls the last 10 minutes out of its rear end. It was originally written as a different movie, then re-tooled for the 'Ocean's' cast, and you can kinda tell; it's darker, tries to be more clever than it actually is, and as a result, is a lot less fun.Whatever strengths the first two movies may or may not have had, the third is lacking them all, except the actors. Everyone from Clooney on down, including Pacino, Vincent Cassel and Eddie Izzard, all bring their A-game, and are pleasant to watch. But the plot is minimal; whether there was a screenplay or not (and there was, from the writers of 'Rounders'), you still get the impression that this is just an excuse for buddies to hang out in Vegas and shoot a movie, a la 'Blue in the Face' back in the mid-1990's. No one has to do any heavy lifting, and the only actors who even try are the bickering brothers of Casey Affleck and Scott Caan, and of course Pacino, though he could be phoning it in too, and you'd never know it.Whether you're a movie fanatic or not, the three films can still be summed up by their opening shots. In the first film, cut to: a chair. Clooney sits down in it. The movie itself is really about him, and what makes his Danny Ocean tick, not just before, but during, and after the action. In the second film, cut to: a magnifying glass. Brad Pitt walks into a room, and the next 100 minutes is a closer look at Rusty's life and his relationship with the woman he wakes up in that first scene. Third film? Cut to: a toy store. Yeah, that sounds about right. Soderbergh ain't so dumb.",6,10,18,10 June 2007
Notting Hill," Is this supposed to be funny?
","In the brain-dead world of the U.S. sitcom, there's a common plot device called 'embarrassing the protagonist,' in which some idiot writer apparently finds mountains of hilarity in rendering the protagonist speechless; as with a kick to the groin, getting covered in gallons of some food product, or stammering out a rambling monologue when the guy/girl should really just shut up, etc.  Somebody, somewhere, must find these things funny.  If you see such a person, please smack them, and if you are such a person, what on earth is wrong with you?There are about three genuinely funny moments in 'Notting Hill,' and the rest of the film features various Brits making asses of themselves.  I wasn't laughing, I was cringing.  This is entertainment?Not a single character in the film is particularly nice-- note how Thacker tries to impress the girl by calling his roommate a 'pea-brained idiot.' (Well, maybe he is, but guys don't usually impress girls by insulting people, do they?).  Anna Scott is remarkably shallow and is given about 3 lines of character development in the whole film, all of which occur during the birthday party scene.  Why is Thacker interested in her, other than because she's famous?  Why is Anna interested in Thacker, other than he looks like Hugh Grant?  These questions are ones we loud Americans are apparently not allowed to ask, we're just supposed to point and laugh and actually believe this couple actually has a shot at a real life.  The characters barely talk after they meet; character development is replaced with pop songs.  Note to director: it's NOT THE SAME THING!!Shallow characters, shallow writing, and it seems to be shallow directing, too, as the actors really do their best with the material given, which is really just Generic Sitcom Plot #7 stretched to feature-length, with better cinematography.  5/10.",5,4,9,6 August 2002
The Bourne Identity," Like 'Bullitt,' except for Franka, the Mustang, and the CIA
","The User Comment currently on the front page for this movie contains the assumption that the film 'Changing Lanes' is 'brilliant,' so it becomes clear that some IMDB users will always be insane.Matt Damon is a thinking man's actor.  Ben Affleck is not.  While the two came together effectively enough in 'Good Will Hunting,' it's much more fun to watch Damon on his own here, as both Bourne and the viewer find out more and more about just what this man is capable of.  It's not handed to you on a platter, as with most Hollywood fare-- a certain intellectual flexibility is required to watch the character literally start from scratch, and learn what's been hidden in his mind, both physically and emotionally, a little bit at a time.This is, of course, assuming you buy the brain-free conceit that the character really did lose all his memories, but millions of Robert Ludlum readers (my mother is one, I am not) seemed to buy it just fine.  Of course, the movie doesn't even begin to resemble the book on any level (imagine that), but as a stand-alone story it's a pretty good time at the movies.A whole lot of great character stuff in Damon's scenes, with two great fights on either end and a well-staged car chase in the middle (though all three are hastily edited).  Chris Cooper remains the most uncharismatic actor I can think of (how DID he pull off 'Lone Star' anyway?!), but the real stars here are Damon and Potente.  They're given as much character as they can really have in a) a 2-hour movie which also has to have enough action to keep Affleck fans entertained, and b) something Tony Gilroy helped write.There's something here for everyone, combining the pointless nastiness of 'Changing Lanes' and the intellectual balsa wood of 'Spider-Man' into something you can actually leave the theater thinking about-- or not, depending on your taste.  To call it cliche is to not even pay attention-- yes, there are spies, and yes, there's a chase.  But they're handled in innovative, exciting ways, without resorting to the vacant hocus-pocus of 'The Saint,' or the blind stupid luck of Any Film Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Anyone who says differently must have expected 'Bourne' to burst into song, because there's really only so many ways you can go in a spy movie, or in a western, or whatever.  Pay attention, people.8.5 of 10, which I'm rounding up cuz I like Doug Liman.  I really shouldn't grant the .5, because not one character had a sense of humor, and this big international thriller had too many close-ups, as if Liman were making tiny-budgeted 'Swingers' again.  But I can't help myself, I had too much fun.  Keep at it, Doug.",9,0,1,16 June 2002
Pitch Black," Incredible, Cinematic Sci-Fi
","I've read comments from others on this movie, and it really frustrates me that so many of the IMDB users just don't get it.This is an incredible film: intelligent, funny, scary, touching, tense and thought-provoking, all in no particular order.These characters are real characters, not just stock, by-the-book regular characters that you only care about because the actors who play them are on the cover of Entertainment Weekly.The thought put into these characters, as well as the ecological structure of the planet (not to mention the opening crash landing), is clearly more in-depth than some viewers (both at the box office and on the IMDB) are giving it credit for.  Anyone who paid attention in school can hopefully interpret what they see on the screen, and see how much thought David Twohy and the other writers put in to how these creatures would evolve in such an environment, and how the rest of the planet-- visiting humans, or otherwise-- would react.So the premise isn't 100% believable, but that's a nitpicky excuse from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about.  Humans can't travel between solar systems, EITHER, but no one thought to comment on THAT.  It's a freakin' movie folks, certain things have to be accepted.  This ship is going from Planet A to Planet B, and they crashed on a planet that has comparable gravity and atmosphere to Earth, and it's got 3 suns.  Stranger things happen on Star Trek and I don't see a single negative comment THERE... heck, it's even more improbable that an Alien (1979) could have acid for blood, but everyone bought that without batting an eyelash.Ignore the Nitpicky comments you see on this site.  This is a well-thought out, character-driven sci-fi story that I was riveted too, both by the characters, and the amazing visual images that Twohy has brought to the screen.  If 'The Arrival' was only a glimmer of his writing/directing talent, this is a full-on assault on the nerves of any self-respecting movie-goer... I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.Oh, and the moral lesson at the end.  It succeeded where Saving Private Ryan failed completely.  And if you don't know what that means, you're one of the people I'm taking a shot at.9/10.  Sure it's not making money, but neither did Fight Club.  History will decide.",9,0,0,9 March 2000
North by Northwest," I'm Not a Hitchcock Fan, but this I like
","After years of recommendation, I finally watched NXNW.  Over the years I have seen four other Hitchcock films-- 'Psycho' (it felt 30 minutes too long), 'Rear Window' (it felt at LEAST 30 minutes too long), 'Shadow of a Doubt' (loved it), and 'Vertigo' (2 hours, felt like it was six).  After a track record like that, I began to think that either a) Years of watching films from the 1980's and -90's has ruined me, or b) Hitchcock isn't nearly as brilliant as some people seem to think he is.  Turns out-- big surprise-- it's a mixture of both.'Vertigo' was very stylish (in parts), but I don't think it holds up, as the story is told much too slowly to make me care.  With 'North by Northwest' I was pulled in right from the very beginning-- the writing was wonderful. Plot structure and many of the one-liners were too much fun to watch and hear, and with the exception of some cleverly-used 1959 special effects, this screenplay could be remade today, as written, if only because Cary Grant can't open a film anymore (although with a script this great, it wouldn't really matter who the lead was).Whereas I marveled at screenwriter Lehman's work every few minutes, and Hitchcock's work only every 30 minutes or so, this is still an extremely watchable film and I loved every second of it.  It's almost enough to finally make me a Hitchcock fan... but I think I'll check out some Lehman films first.",10,1,4,16 August 2001
Van Helsing," Oh, and Did I Mention the Costumes Were Designed by a Retarded Baboon?
","Boring, loud, all character removed in favor of bigger special effects which no one has yet to prove actually translate into box office dollars.  I'm secure in my masculinity and all, but it's a sad state of affairs when I'm sitting there less than 45 minutes into it, thinking, 'Holy crap, these costumes are AWFUL.'Which, y'know, they ARE... sorry dude, that gigantic hat make you look like a mushroom.  And don't decorate the front of the Hot Female Lead's corset with little red circular designs... they tend to look like something else.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but for the money they spent on it, the producers will burn even lower in Hell than the people who greenlit 'From Justin to Kelly.'  Stephen Sommers had a good start with 'The Mummy,' but now just covers his lazy butt with as much CGI as humanly possible. And that is the single laziest thing a filmmaker can do.  Knock it off.",5,1,2,15 May 2004
Face_Off," Brilliant Performances
","They say John Woo is the master of action.  Don't listen to them.The action sequences get boring when they decide to go to slow motion.  By the end of the film, it was the action sequences that bored me.  But the *acting* in this film is so amazing I will can't recommend this film highly enough.  Action movies don't generally get nominated for anything, least of all Acting awards, but without A+ performances from both Cage and Travolta, the movie wouldn't work.You believe it, 100%. Brilliant piece of work.",9,0,1,14 August 1999
Spider-Man," An Open Letter to Sam Raimi
","Dear Mr. Raimi,You hack.  You won me over with the Evil Dead films, showed true promise with 'For Love of the Game,' and showed a true director's gift with 'A Simple Plan.'  What the hell happened?Mostly, I suppose we can blame the script.  David Koepp has never had a fond place in my heart, and yes, while he did write the very good 'Panic Room,' the script itself was just okay, it was the director that made that movie. Ditto for 'Jurassic Park,' and anyone who says differently needs to go back and watch that flick again.  For the second Jurassic Park alone, Mr. Koepp should be run out of town on a rail.Was it the studio pressure?  I can sure see how it got to Mr. Burton on that ridiculous 'Planet of the Apes' remake.  Notice, now that the film is all done, and surely making the studio lots of money (all they really care about anyway, so anything said after Opening Day is incidental, right?  WRONG!)... notice how you wimped out, and screwed up a wonderful opportunity:Peter Parker gets cool spider powers.  Neat-o.  His skin allows him to cling to walls, tiny little hairs that let him stick to metal, paper, brick, what have you.  Ahhhh, yes, but then, now he's wearing a suit.  With gloves.  How can he still do this?Ohhh, wait a minute, is the argument.  You're nitpicking, Mr. Internet Guy, OBVIOUSLY it's very thin material.Well, yes, I get that.  I'm not stupid.  Why, then, did you feel the need to not explain that, but then show the flashback of the mugger running past Peter Parker?  Did we forget?  That scene happened TWO MINUTES BEFORE.  Wow, Mr. Raimi, seriously.  Either respect your audience's intelligence, or don't, but riding the fence in such an wimp-out way is only going to get you in trouble.  See also, again, 'Planet of the Apes' remake.Lots of nice moments.  Cinematographer Don Burgess still lacks the visual 'wow' that will ever make him great, so people must hire him because he's cheap; whatever.  Everyone ELSE knew what they were doing here, except Willem Dafoe, who should really go back to drama.  But I can't blame you for casting him; after all, look at what he did for 'Speed 2.'A valiant effort, Mr. Raimi, and I hope these notes will help you when it comes time to put the sequel together.  Special effects are there to HELP the story, not BE the story.  I'm all happy that Peter Parker is enjoying jumping from buildings, but don't you ever EVER replace a character with a CGI effect.  It didn't work in Harry Potter, it didn't work in Blade 2, it sure didn't work for JarJar, and so it doesn't work here.  If I were a movie executive, I would so fire you.However, being literate, I am too intelligent to be a movie executive.  You, Mr. Raimi, used to be smart, I suggest you call up your old buddies the Coens and have a long talk before you make any more rash decisions, like script choices, opening credits (I may care about the names of the cast, but 95% of America does not), or that horrible, awful, direct-to-bargain-bin soundtrack (not the score, mind you; but promise me to never hire Aerosmith or flavor-of-the-month Nickelback again, I don't care how many records they sell).I liked it, but seriously.  Superman II outshone the original, heres hoping you can learn from your mistakes.Warmest Personal Regards,7/10.p.s. Extra cool points for the Lucy Lawless cameo.  See, you CAN be creative when you want to be!!",7,0,0,4 May 2002
Jarhead," Every War Movie is Different. Every War Movie is the Same.
","More than anyone, I would imagine that U.S. Soldiers would have a more specific opinion of this film than anyone else. They were there, they were in it, no one knows better than they.And there are two kinds of soldiers: those who loved it, who took great pride and honor in serving their country... and those who saw it as just a job, got out, and got on with their lives. 'Jarhead' is based on a book, written by a U.S. Marine, who falls squarely into the second category.He does not judge, he does not come out as for or against the war. This is not a political movie, yet will still make some people uncomfortable, and it should. 'Jarhead' lays out the experience of one particular Marine from boot camp, to (suddenly) Operation Desert Shield, to Operation Desert Storm. What happens here is not always pretty, but it is the truth, and the truth should be all we can ask for.The screenplay was adapted by William Broyles Jr., who in addition to some TV work, adapted the recent 'Planet of the Apes' remake, and 'Cast Away.' Personally, I didn't think either of these films were anything special, which is why 'Jarhead' is such a surprise. Not a lot blows up, there's no huge siege like in your typical Vietnam movie... it's a surprisingly affecting study of this one man, the experiences he had, the people he knew. It's about the Corps, and it's about brotherhood. Our main character, Swof, never judges, never mentions politics, is only the best Marine that he knows how to be.As Swof's friend Troy says at one point, 'F*** politics. We're here. All the rest is bull****.' Which is all the movie is about, really. This is what happened. Take it or leave it.",10,261,376,2 November 2005
Collateral," Mann's Best Since 'Heat'
","First, I think 'Heat' is one of the greatest movies of the last 20 years. If you disagree, then any arguement I make here is not going to change your mind.  Technically and emotionally, 'Collateral' and 'Heat' were spot-on, but if you really think 'XXX' is the pinnacle of cinematic achievement, then there's nothing to be done for you.'Collateral' is beautifully shot, acted, and edited.  Michael Mann goes beyond what's on the page, creating a vivid and dark Los Angeles-- and ditto on the performances from his actors, as he shows little subtleties of character, with a look here, a twitching jawline there.  It was the subtlety that I loved, and will make me go back to watch it again as a character study, not just the action movie I walked in expecting (and still got, by the way).I felt like I'd BEEN to L.A. after watching this movie, something which 'Bourne Supremacy' couldn't make work for its numerous locations.  During action sequences in 'Collateral,' Mann is very careful to make sure the camera lingers on the key events, letting you SEE the action-- shooting his actors full frame when necessary, rather than just waist-up or with a shaky steadicam.At its heart, this is an action movie... but one based around character, not on blowing up the next set piece.  The ending was a little abrupt, but it's about the journey, not the destination.  Completely worth a second look, something so few of 2004 releases can say.",Null,1,2,11 August 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Good, But Not Good Enough
","Stuff blows up, people get stabbed, great big setpieces fall down.  If this is all you require for an action movie, thumbs up, go to it, have fun.  It's rated PG-13, but don't let that dissuade you.  Your mind is already made up.For the rest of you (and me), not so much.  The reason the first half of each franchise (Predator 1, Alien, Aliens) was/were so successful was not just because of the violence, body count, or cool-lookin' bad guy, but because they were pitted against humans we cared about.  We spent time with them, we got to see them in action, and that made it all the more horrifying when they're offed, one at a time.  We're supposed to be rooting for the humans.This movie, like 'Freddy vs. Jason' before it, is made SOLELY for us to pick our favorite bad guy, and root for THEM, humans be damned.  Oddly, even 'FvJ' had some character development.  In this one, we meet TWO whole characters in the initial set-up, and the carnage begins almost immediately. I don't care about the people, and now they're gone, and now I'm bored.It's remarkably similar to Paul W.S. Anderson's earlier movies-- we don't count 'Mortal Kombat' because he didn't write it, and we don't count 'Soldier' because it sucked.  The shots of the holographic underground complex, the rag-tag recruits, even Colin Salmon's death.  Not only has it been done before and better, it's been done before and better BY ANDERSON.The ending is pretty nice (if a little obvious), but getting there isn't really worth it, when only half the cast has any lines at all, and only half of them say something beyond 'Help Me!'  There's room for improvement, but somewhere in this 90-minute PG-13 C+ of a movie, there's a 120-minute R-rated A+, screaming to get out.",7,1,2,21 August 2004
The Transporter," Stuff Blows Up
","Not as good as 'The Matrix' but better than, say, 'Gone in 60 Seconds.' Somewhere in the opening action sequence, there's a scene where Frank Martin (Statham) jumps off a bridge onto a car-hauling truck beneath, which just HAPPENS to have an empty slot on the top between two cars. This would be well and good if the character had set this up, but because it's never mentioned again, we are left to believe that this is simply an AMAZING coincidence.The movie is loaded with AMAZING coincidences, but the action sequences are exciting, and there's never an awkward attempt to bring a brain into the proceedings (like they did in, say, the first Spider-Man movie). This flick suffers for being PG-13, but other than that, no complaints. Guys get kicked in the chest, people get shot, stuff blows up. There's something to be said for keepin' it simple.",8,1,2,24 March 2005
Hellboy," Oh, Hell
","I never noticed it before, but Guillermo del Toro is one of THOSE directors.You know, the one who has a phenomenal visual sense, but has no idea what to do with those bothersome things called 'actors.' To see this problem at its worst, make note of the awful 'Bulletproof Monk,' but del Toro is several shades better in that he hides it very, very well. In fact, so well I never noticed until now.The average movie-goer doesn't care. If you've seen this movie, you probably didn't even notice that the actors just kind of stand around, and when they do move (in any scene where they're not replaced by CGI-effects), it's without much thought to it (walking down a hall; walking down a street).The action sequences are very creative, I really did like this movie. Thumbs up. But I can't give it any better than a B. Great effects, great acting, but the storytelling was only so/so, and so was the dialogue. I felt like I was watching the 2nd season premiere of some HBO series, or worse, 3 or 4 episodes from the middle of season 2 just kinda crunched together. There was no arc to it-- this happened, then that happened, the end. Characters came back from the dead so easily, it's like, what's the importance of even killing them in the first place? The bad guys are just gonna get up again in 5 minutes. Where's the rest of the story?Despite ALL this, I didn't hate it. Ron Perlman and Selma Blair are way too charismatic, even when they're given lines that are MEANT to sound cool but were actually written by a 40-year-old filmmaker who thinks he has the same taste in one-liners as a 20-year-old. Granted, yes, I liked this better than Del Toro's 'Blade 2,' but there's still major room for improvement here. Any word on when the world will get 'Hellboy Returns,' or better yet 'Hellboy Forever?'If they're better than the first one, the way 'X-2' was light years better than 'X-Men,' then those are the films I want to see. 8/10.",8,0,0,3 April 2004
Stardust," Earth to Director: Stick with Directing
","I had a longer thing here, but ultimately this movie isn't worth that many words. It can be summed up in just a few, actually: Matthew Vaughn, longtime producer, directed the movie 'Layer Cake.' Nice debut.For some reason, afterwards, he decided he was a screenwriter too. He isn't.His screen writing partner is someone with no writing to her credit, and according to the IMDb seems to be little more than a TV personality. Their screenplay is awful, trite, simplistic and condescending, but you can still see the starlight of a brilliant book (which I have not read) shining through.The actors mostly bring their A-game. Claire Danes is passable, but isn't a star (either within or outside the movie), and has a horrible British accent. Robert Deniro doesn't even attempt an accent, so at least he's playing to his strengths (sort of). Name actors are given very little to do, and no-name actors are given huge parts to play. The results are mixed.I did enjoy the movie while I was watching it, but afterwards I had time to ask questions. Questions like 'why the heck was there only one guard on the wall 24-hours a day? didn't he have back-up?' or, 'Why the heck did they cast three younger actresses to play the old witches, and only one (Michelle Pfeiffer) is ever seen as herself? Why not just cast 2 older actresses and save on the wrinkled latex?' It's incredibly sloppy construction, but Vaughn wanted to add to his audition reel, I guess, and hung his fancy suburban home (er, flat) on the blueprints of a Beverly Hills mansion. This is a C-minus movie that should have been an A+.Just because you can direct a film does not mean you can write a screenplay. See also 'Spider-Man 3.' In the case of 'Stardust,' I heard the book was phenomenal, and the Neil Gaiman I've read defies description.This movie doesn't. It's just pretty okay. See you at the library.",7,7,13,12 August 2007
Meet Joe Black," Too Many Cooks Spoiled the Broth
","A beautiful film, at times.  Director Martin Brest hit his stride with 'Scent of a Woman,' and that style is evidenced here-- the scene when the young Ms. Parrish meets the Man in the Coffee shop, at the beginning, is a truly beautiful scene, and it is moments like this that the director, and the film, thrive upon.The moment immediately after it, coupled with the ending of the film, simply do not gel.  Without giving the ending away, there was simply no thought put into it.  Every individual moment in the film works superbly on its own terms, but as a whole, the film fails.  This can only be the fault of *SEVEN* credited screenwriters, four people trying to update a screenplay written by two people, working from a play written by a single man. Hollywood overkill in its purest form.This film was great, almost.  One more rewrite and it could have been there, it's a pity this version got made.  It's like a really beautiful sports car, excellent interior, exterior, sound system, but it's missing a radio.  You can enjoy it on so many levels, but it really feels like it's missing something.7/10, and a wish that Brest reads his next script before he shoots it.",7,0,0,20 September 2000
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Alexander Witt's Filmography Doesn't Lie
","Don't believe the hype. The facts don't lie-- this movie was buried in September for a reason, and with an Assistant Cinematographer at the helm of a multi-million dollar franchise. What could go wrong?I won't go into it here-- click on his name-- but there is nothing in this guy's past to indicate he has even marginal directing talent, let alone something with a budget this size. And it shows. 'RE:A' lacks character, any kind of dramatic arc, and the action sequences are shot in that choppy, what-just-happened blur that I thought went out with the Reagan Administration. Also on that list, the Wacky Token Minority. Where 'Dawn of the Dead' was a step forward for the action horror movie, 'RE:A' is a leap backward of such incredible crap-taking proportions, it should have its own Olympic Event.I've never met Alexander Witt, but based on this pile of garbage he actually thinks is a film, we can deduce the following facts about him: ONE, he has never directed a film before. Even without the IMDb, this is obvious. Characters show up and disappear for no reason, the living AND the dead disappear from the story after the first 10 minutes, 30-second side-scenes of cross-town events are inserted at random into a large action sequence, and every sequence in the movie is shot from 12 angles and edited together at random. TWO, he has no taste in music. I'm no huge Slipknot fan, but at least it fit the first movie. The sequel is all 'dramatic score' and only two metal songs to speak of, both of which kind of lay there like old people having sex. Yawn. Oh, and THREE... Alexander Witt must REALLY be Paul Anderson's b*tch, or else how did Anderson look at this film, as a producer, and say 'Oh yes, we should release THAT.'In all likelihood, Anderson cranked out this script in a weekend, then threw it at Witt on his way out the door to make the Only-Slightly-Better (which isn't saying much) 'Alien vs. Predator.' The only difference I can pinpoint is that 'AvP' had production values. In 'RE:A,' everyone who isn't the Production Designer should erase this one from their resume, and fast.Where the first film had a plot, a purpose (escape the Hive, find out who Alice is), this film just kind of wanders, like the living dead. I think 30 minutes in, some characters are told to rescue a girl from the city, but that takes all of 5 minutes, then we're back to wandering again. For your action fix, rent anything else. For your Milla fix, well... she's naked in this one, but not as naked as the first one. Which sums it up, really-- if your sequel is worse than the original, the franchise dies. So now Anderson has killed the Predator, Alien, AND Resident Evil franchises in less than a month. Dude, maybe it's time you made up with the guy who wrote Mortal Kombat Part One?",3,2,8,10 September 2004
Caddyshack," Ahoy Polloi
","Yes, it's a funny movie. No, it doesn't age well. That's not to say it's unfunny over 20 years later, it's just a very different film with all of the actors either off the radar or making different types of movies entirely.The movie is basically a hastily thrown together script featuring improvisations from Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray, surrounded by actual professional actors doing their best to hold the scenes together. Cindy Morgan is beautiful, Michale O'Keefe is charismatic, and neither of them were ever (well, almost never) heard from again.Fun to watch the most popular comedic actors of the 1980's do their thing, but all these years later the bad edits really stand out, the low-budget sticks up, and Harold Ramis shows he's not quite up to the task of directing a real movie. For a fake one, though, this is pretty good. 8/10.",8,2,3,18 March 2005
Shrek 2," Shrek 2: Cruise Control
","The musical numbers aren't funny, inspired, or even any good; the 'reinventing' of signs and logos, while funny, are nothing we haven't already seen on 'The Simpsons,' a thousand times; and the clever, creative soundtrack of the first film is watered down by many bands who are thrown in just to sell a few more records, and not because they have particularly interesting voices, or the talent of Tom Waits or Leonard Cohen or even Joan Jett.The first one was a fairy tale; this one is just a wacky comedy, with dull, lifeless musical numbers that won't appeal to anyone over the age of seven. (Ricky Martin?!  Were the Spice Girls too expensive?) I appreciate the adult jokes thrown in with the kids stuff, but nothing is worth hearing Eddie Murphy sing.  Puss in Boots is funny, the Fairy Godmother isn't, and while the animation is beautiful... the movie itself is just as good as it can possibly be, without being as good as the original.",8,0,0,24 May 2004
For Love of the Game," Sam Raimi, the Serious Director
","Sam Raimi and the Coen Brothers are good friends.  It was not until Raimi's last two films-- this one, and 'A Simple Plan,'-- that Raimi got all artistic on us.  And the two styles are very, very similar.The difference is that the Coen Brothers know what they're doing.  Raimi directs some very, very good scenes in this film, with excellent characterization and emotion.  Every scene is wonderfully done.  The problem is that every scene is treated like a beautifully rendered boxcar, and they were just all sorta put together, end to end, with no sense of dramatic arc or overall picture.The end of the baseball game was quite dramatic and beautifully done.  The end of the FILM, exactly one scene later, is anticlimactic and unfulfilling. But it was directed well.Great 'serious' outing for Raimi.  I hope he learns from his mistakes.  Or else learns how to incorporate the style of THIS film, with the style that made him famous.",8,0,0,13 October 1999
Pride & Prejudice," Wonderful Moments, Both Big and Small
","There's really nothing negative to say about the film. The actors are perfectly cast, the direction is subtle and well-realized, and even a shade more cinematic than I would have expected, or than it needed to be. The moment, early in the film, when Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are arguing while dancing, and as they look at each other, everyone else in the room disappears... emotional, cinematic, and brilliant. Soft little touches like this, throughout the film, make it work far better than some dry BBC version of any Jane Austen book.Yes yes, I'm male, and I enjoy a good car chase and explosion as much as the next guy. Tragically, there was none of that in this movie, but I'll get over it. Ladies, you'll want to watch this movie over and over. And guys, trust me: Even if this movie isn't your 'thing,' if you take your date to this one, you're in good shape.Ten of Ten, and that's after I saw the Bollywood 'Bride and Prejudice' not too long ago. That one was fun, but this version had the emotional impact, camera-work and staging that seemed to do Ms. Austen the most justice. Wonderful moments both big and small.",10,11,15,2 January 2006
The Mummy Returns," This Film Needs a Benny
","The original was character driven and fun, as well as funny.  This one spent much more time and effort on big-budget special effects than character development or humor.  This film needed a Benny.The hot-air balloon idea was contrived, badly written, and poorly animated. The character of Izzy just isn't filled in enough, and that IS a writing problem, not an acting problem.  The movie feels like it was thrown together, re-written by a half-dozen studio executives who wanted to mix the original with 'The Matrix' and remove everything intelligent.  I liked the characters in the first film quite a bit.  I missed them.  And other than faint glimpses of the original Rick, and even fainter ones of Evie (more of which are shown via Alex than Rachel Weisz), they're not here at all.  Great actors given nothing to do but react to special effects, as opposed to (as in the first one) each other.A good idea squandered-- I liked it, but any director is likely to be surrounded by Yes-men after a success like the original 'Mummy.'Worth watching once.  The original was worth watching a dozen times.  Do what makes you happy.",7,0,0,7 May 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," One o' them Thinkin' Pictures
","Criticisms on this movie are varied-- from the legitimate to the inane, to the insane.  To each their own.  But I appreciated the movie as it was intended, I think, and that's why I have to say I loved the darn thing.Note to all would-be reviewers: 'Boring' is not an acceptable criticism.  So you were bored.  Why?  Because nothing was exploding for 20 minutes in a row?  What kind of dull human being are YOU?Characters discuss philosophy, the meaning of reality and the meaning of control.  We see Zion for the first time, we see that Morpheus is not only a captain, but a preacher and a lover as well.  Audiences are invited to debate, discuss and revel in these things after movies end, and not only that, but the fate of other characters, and how they got to be in that state.A good discussion, you may find, is what really helps your appreciation for a movie open up, as you yell at your friends and they yell at you over what the extremely well-educated Wachowski Brothers labored to produce, and make you think about.But if you're the kind of slothful soul who likes to stare at a movie and watch things explode for two hours... don't clutter my IMDB because you hate it when characters 'talk.'  '2 Fast 2 Furious' is playing two doors down, and you're welcome to it.10/10",10,4,6,27 June 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Lesser Than the Sum of Its Parts
","As a critic and student of film myself, my first look at the poster for this film brought mixed emotions: directed by Ron Howard (yes!), written by Akiva Goldsman (oh no!)A simple glance at Mr. Goldsman's filmography gives a very nice look at a list of movies that range from the non-threateningly mediocre ('A Time to Kill'), to the atrociously horrible ('Batman and Robin,' 'Lost in Space'). I looked forward to this film with the sort of morbid curiosity one usually reserves for a pet with a terminal illness.The film is not at all horrible.  On the contrary, about 70-75% of it is quite good.  Ron Howard remains one of the most talented directors of our time, and Russell Crowe gives an outstanding, nuanced performance.  Also, there are charismatic and enjoyable performances from supporting players Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Paul Bettany.Despite the best efforts of the supporting players, however, none of them really have much to work with.  Ed Harris almost does, but by the time Goldsman yanks the rug out from under Nash (and the viewer) halfway through the film, I developed an animosity toward 'A Beautiful Mind' that I never recovered from.Howard does wonderful visual work, as does cinematographer (and Coen Brothers staple) Roger Deakins.  Relating the unique, ulrta-logical way Nash's mind works is no easy task, and Howard rises to it.The mediocre writing, however, does nothing more than tell a good story badly, and I don't think Howard's visual flare ever makes up for it.  I'm all good and happy that Goldsman saw 'Fight Club,' but he's not nearly as talented as anyone involved with that film will ever be.Note to the viewer-- when Christopher Plummer shows up, do yourself a favor: get up, leave, take a bathroom break, or fast forward about 20 minutes into the future.  This bungled plot device fails, but the rest of the film is really about an A-minus.Ultimately flawed, but a nice homage to the real John Nash.  If those who knew him liked the film, then what else is there to say?",7,0,2,11 February 2002
Wedding Crashers," Thank God this was R-Rated.
","Not a great film, it works because of the unusual situation(s) the leads find themselves in, and also the R-rated parts added back in, which are welcome. Hopefully this will remind Hollywood that there will always be an audience for R-rated material; naked women never go out of style.The characterization is barely there-- Vince Vaughn steals the movie just by showing up, and Owen Wilson is fleshed out more by Vince's actions and lines than anything Wilson brings to the proceedings. Some other fun characters show up, but aren't fleshed out at all, even Vince's psycho-stalker gets one good character line at the end, when there was so much more to be said. The movie is paced and directed amateurishly, which is no huge surprise if you look at director David Dobkin's filmography.If I wrote the movie, that would frustrate me to no end, but I only had to sit through it once, and it was adequate. Hopefully it's the re-emerging of its genre, but even if it's not, it was an okay time. Watch for an unbilled cameo, as well as Christopher Walken for no apparent reason. It's a movie-reviewer cliché to use the word 'radiant,' but Rachel McAdams was radiant. And Jane Seymour is still hot. Nice.",7,1,2,25 July 2005
Scream 2," A Parody of a Bad Sequel? Or Just a Bad Sequel?
","I can't decide if this was a really clever parody of a bad horror sequel... or if it just WAS one.I don't think the filmmakers could decide either.  I guess we won't know until we see 'Scream 3.'Horrible script, decent direction = not enough to warrant a need to ever watch it again.  They killed our favorite characters, they pulled the killers out of their ass... so is it a bad sequel, or a parody of one?  I can't tell, but then, I don't care.",6,0,0,14 September 1999
Ray," Near the Top
","What's the best biopic you've ever seen? Quick, answer. Tick tock. Can't think of anything? The Aviator? Ali? Coal Miner's Daughter? Yeah, that's not a very impressive list. 'What's Love Got to Do With It?' is the best I can think of, but then, I haven't seen every movie ever made. Adding 'Ray' to the list, it ranks near the top, but then, it wasn't a very accomplished category to begin with.'Ali' was not a great film. Let's get that out of our heads right now. Will Smith is charismatic and great IN it, but the story the filmmakers chose to tell was an incomplete one, beginning after he was already five minutes from the top of his game, and ending thirty years before the hype did. The non-Smith performances were weak and unmemorable; the reach of the film extended its grasp. This is how history will remember that film, if history remembers it at all.In my cynicism, I WANT to say the exact same things about 'Ray.' I can't, of course, because the movie is better than that... amazing how it managed to meet expectations and exceed them a the exact same time.Ray Charles had a different way of speaking, a cadence to him. He'd lean back, he'd sway from side to side, his entire body would move even when he wasn't playing piano. This was not because he was blind, but after watching the movie I still couldn't tell you why he carried himself like he did. I know more about what HAPPENED to him, but not one iota about WHY he made the choices he made. Sure, he got hooked on heroin and had a thing for many (hot) women. He's human. But the personal choices, like why he stayed with certain certain people, chose this song instead of that one, that sort of thing. Blank slate, man. Blank slate.But the movie is good. It's watchable, it's charismatic, it floats along with a breeze both light and dark that makes the film eminently watchable. The actors are more charismatic and memorable than the rogue's gallery of 'Ali,' as director (and co-screenwriter) Taylor Hackford recognizes that making Charles the sole focus of the story is a bad idea. You get to spend significant time with others in his life even if, as mentioned, you don't necessarily get to learn much about them.Ironically, Foxx was actually IN 'Ali,' and I can't recall if his performance actually stood out, or if I was just watching him more closely because I knew he was five minutes from becoming the biggest star in the world. But 3 years have passed since 'Ali,' and I can't remember a single thing about it except Smith's accent, and its stilted timeline. Three years from now, I'll remember 'Ray' for the style, the smile, the music, the attention to detail (of the times, not just the profession of its subject), and a wonderful ensemble cast for whom I wish only good things (Kerry Washington deserves her own movie).When Taylor Hackford is on, he's on-- witness 'Devil's Advocate,' or 'An Officer and a Gentleman.' When he's not, we get 'Dolores Claiborne.' I'd love to say it's because he's the superior writer, but then, Michael Mann did indeed write 'Heat,' one of those rare films where everything goes not just right, but right plus ten.The reasons for all this? We don't know. But 'Ray' captures them better than any biopic in recent memory, even if it doesn't dig quite deep enough into them. I can't complain. You, won't either. 8/10.",8,4,7,4 February 2005

Blow," No Thank You
","There really isn't anything wrong with the writing, and ESPECIALLY nothing wrong with the acting, as the ever-talented Depp is surrounded by a wealth of talent, with the possible exception of the extremely confused Penelope Cruz, the only actor in the film with no character depth at all, nor any attempt to even find any.The direction is of course extremely mediocre, except for the very beginning, and the very end.  But the two bookends of the movie are so unlike each other I think Mr. Demme just got lucky.  If he wants to direct amusing romps like 'The Ref,' then more power to him, but the guy just doesn't have a mastery of the art form needed to make this movie interesting all the way through-- he doesn't make art, or even film, he makes 'movies,' and we've seen that all before.  Something really cool every 15-20 minutes isn't enough to make me thank the guy for taking my seven bucks.  And I'm pretty sure that was the talent of the actors outshining his sorry skills anyway.

Final Destination," Not Waving, but Drowning
","This is an interesting piece of work.It was conceived and shot by crew members from 'The X-Files,' and such, the directorial style is not as cinematic as it could be.  Shots and effects are simple and underwhelming, like you'd find on TV; they do what the script calls for and little more.  But the script itself is a remarkable piece of work.As such, the film is smarter than you'd think it to be.  What most people would pass off as 'just a Horror film,' is actually an incredibly taught Suspense film, that just happens to have some rather disturbing gory death scenes.Sawa is a remarkable actor, he shows a lot more depth and talent here than he showed in the Intelligence-Isn't-Necessary (but still entertaining) 'Idle Hands.'  My only complaint is his under-reacting to watching friends get killed right in front of him, but I'd peg that on under-directing.  See above.What is the Final Destination for all of us?  Who decides our fate?  What can we see in the world around us to answer these questions?This film made me think, but it can be enjoyed on the level of Popcorn Flick, as well.  The concept, and its execution, were remarkably clever.  I hope James Wong is allowed to direct more films, so he can learn as he goes. This was a GREAT script, but only a GOOD director.  The finished product is still a lot of fun to watch (if you can stomach the death scenes, which are all more gory than they really need to be).If I were grading this film I'd give it an 85 out of 100, but since we're dealing on a different scale, I'll round up.  9 out of 10.",9,0,0,8 April 2000
Cube," Clever, but not clever enough
","Hardly an original concept (look up 'House of Stairs' by William Sleator), this is a tense and suspenseful movie, where the set is more of a star than the actors, all of whom play underwritten and stupid characters.  I'm no math genius, but I'm fully aware that an even number is never going to be prime.I got a kick out of it, once, but the ending soured me.  It worked well as a metaphor for the human condition, I suppose, but on its own terms, the only thing I could get out of it was, How Pointless.  What a Canadian thing to think.

Sin City," Minor Quibbles
","First thing's first: Good movie. Very, very good movie. But not great. Let me be clear, I saw this movie on opening weekend with four friends, two of them HUGE and well-versed fans of the graphic novels, and a third who had just read them the week before. Among them, they had zero complaints. So maybe I'm splitting hairs. You tell me--First, and most obvious to me, was the fact that no actor ever stood more than 10 feet away from the camera. In close-ups, this isn't a problem, but in every group shot or wide shot, the actors were ALWAYS in the foreground, and never spaced very far apart, depth-wise. After 20 minutes, I could start to see where the green screen hung on the back wall. Not literally, of course, but I had a pretty good idea. In the 'Big Fat Kill' sequence, when the cops chase Jackie-Boy's gang into Old Town, there are four or five hookers who show up to watch... they're ALL in the foreground, on the same corner, just extras who walk in and flash their g-strings at the camera. To me, that's the most obvious example, but again, I could be nitpicking.Second, there was no dramatic arc. Zero. The graphic novels felt real, because with a hundred still-shots making up a book, your brain fills in the rest. With a motion picture, in this case, filling in the rest FOR me, I didn't find it as affecting. A character dies, a character is injured, beaten, kissed, I felt nothing. In the books it was real, because Frank Miller's incredible artwork evoked the emotion he was going for in any individual frame: fear, terror, revulsion, lust. In the movie, with a familiar face filling in, the actors LOOK like their characters, but they don't INHABIT them. The best way around that, of course, is to cast no-names, but I understand it's tough to market a movie like that. So there we are.Beyond that, I still have to say I enjoyed the movie. The visuals were stunning, both Miller's original work, and Rodriguez's interpretation of it to turn it into a real place. I just missed the character, which isn't usually present in an action movie anyway, but, y'know, it was in the books, so... maybe it's just me. 8/10.",8,0,1,7 April 2005
Gangs of New York," An Absolute Mess
","There's over 1000 comments on the film a this point, so I can't say I have anything new to add or any new point to argue. The characters are exceptionally weak, and the screenplay reeks of a vanity project written by committee.After watching 'The Deer Hunter' for the first time a few months back, I was looking through criticism for that film, and recall one critic of the time saying that given too much money and time, it is entirely possible for a filmmaker to become so self-important that he could literally climb up his own ass.More accurately, in her review of 'The Deer Hunter,' Pauline Kael spoke thusly: '(It is) a small minded film with greatness in it... with an enraptured view of common life... (but) enraging, because, despite its ambitiousness and scale, it has no more moral intelligence than the Eastwood action pictures.' The consensus of that film, released around the same time 'Gangs' was conceived, was 'Its (The Deer Hunter) greatness is blunted by its length and one-sided point of view, but the film's weaknesses are overpowered by Michael Cimino's sympathetic direction and a series of heartbreaking performances from Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, and Christopher Walken.''Gangs of New York' is precisely all of these, except without the great acting performances. Daniel Day-Lewis goes beyond superb and achieves something even greater, but the film around him is so ambling and weak (despite spectacular production-design), that there's still no reason to watch it. A different filmmaker made the far more wise decision of letting Day-Lewis chew scenery as a lead and not as a supporting player, and that entire film was lauded with praise and positive reviews it richly deserved. 'Gangs' deserves none of these.DiCaprio, though still a commanding presence, remains a weak actor without an ear for accents, as in this film he is only occasionally Irish. He feels it is his job to simply arrive on set and glower (or cry), and Scorsese is content to let him. The film is weaker for it, despite grand performances from every supporting actor, including Cameron Diaz. There is no shortage of attractive blondes in Hollywood, but even in 2002 she was aware she'd better put something on screen besides her piercing blue eyes, and shockingly, she does... despite the incredibly meager material. She is charming and damaged all at once, from the first time we see her until about 80 minutes into the film... the instant her character has sex with the hero, she becomes a glorified extra.The entire film is similarly rambling, with no direction or clear plot. We're vaguely aware our hero wants to kill the man who killed his father, but he is given the chance several times and does nothing. In voice-over, we are told, 'You don't kill a King alone in the dark, but in front of the entire Court,' but of numerous chances given, some of them are indeed quite public. None are taken, as Amsterdams reasons for not doing so exist only in Scorsese's head, and not anywhere on screen.Scorsese must have known this was a mess, because he pushed back the films original release date by a year, in order to keep working on it (something unheard of, and a concession that could only be made to a director of his reputation). He's made three more films with DiCaprio since then, and 'The Departed' is easily the best of them, though by no means even in the Top Five for Scorsese's once-storied career.If you're a fan of DiCaprio's strong presence, or weak acting, or his toned abdominal muscles, there are other films from not just Scorsese but other directors as well. If you are a fan of Day-Lewis' chameleonic transformations, there can be no other option but 'There Will Be Blood.' If you are a fan of violent history lessons, the 21st century has given us The History Channel.The IMDb trivia section says Scorsese wanted to make this film in the early 1980s, but the failure of Heaven's Gate (Michael Cimino's follow-up to 'The Deer Hunter') caused studios to shy away from making big-budget, expensive historical dramas. Miramax should have done the same in the early 2000s, because there's nothing great about this film, and the only reason it got made is not because of any perceived greatness of Scorsese... he got here simply by outlasting all the rest. Maybe he's a little less Amsterdam, and a little more Bill, after all... in which case we should thank him for his past services, and hit him with something heavy if he keeps trying to make any more movies.5/10, would not recommend to anyone, not even fans of Scorsese's.",5,0,1,5 August 2010
Donnie Darko," Why do you wear that stupid rabbit suit?
","I tried to keep quiet.  I thought someone else could write a better comment on this A+ film than I could.  But since the current comment on the front IMDB page for this film is by someone who never even bothered to watch it.... you can't have ignorant people influencing honest, hard-working IMDB-readers like YOU.Just go and rent Donnie Darko, and please do expect it to be a 1980's teen romance.  It is and it isn't, of course... 'Donnie Darko' is one of those films where describing it is kind of like describing a painting-- you'll never do it justice.  I had to bribe two friends to see it with me, knowing only that it had played the film festivals, and Richard Kelly was getting rave reviews-- and that Drew Barrymore liked it so much, she helped get it made.For me, I give it a 10 out of 10.  Of my two friends, one of them despised the ending, and said it dragged on too long... but hey, there are a lot of loose ends to tie up.  Mary McDonnell is the most underrated female actress of the past ten years, dating back to her nuanced performance in 'Dances with Wolves.'  She held together 'Sneakers,' too, which was a really fun movie, no matter what you say.Already I'm taking up too much space.  This film is not for the mainstream-- most people, especially kids, like their movies easily describable.  You can sum up any Vin Diesel movie in one sentence.  'Donnie Darko' might take 500 words or more, and why shouldn't that be a GOOD thing??'Darko' is more layered, more subtle.  It takes its time.  It relies on more than just the soundtrack to get an emotion across.  This is what a movie should be, but I guess more people don't like to think and watch a movie at the same time.  And so 'Daredevil' makes $100 million, and 'Donnie Darko' plays a few screens, then slips quietly off to DVD...So do us all a favor.  See the movie before you comment.  If you don't understand it, that doesn't mean it stinks.  That just means there's a new J.Lo movie opening that you're late for.",10,0,1,10 March 2003
The Bourne Supremacy," The Bourne Spy Project
","It's weird reading my original comment on 'The Bourne Identity,' because it turns out Chris Cooper is NOT uncharismatic (I still hated him in 'Lone Star'), and more importantly, Tony Gilroy does not suck.The writing here is the best part.  It's been two years and I still haven't gotten around to reading the book, but as a stand-alone film, the three sides butting heads is an effective and well-realized spy thriller.  No great one-liners, but some well-defined characters (and character acting) from everyone involved.  Even Julia Stiles.Was the decision to shoot the entire movie like 'The Blair Witch Project' intentional, or just bad filmmaking?  This is the first American film from director Paul Greengrass, and I'm not familiar with his work-- but when there's SO much more going on than three kids in a forest, isn't it important that we actually see the locations, the actors, the thrown punches and the crashed cars?Cinemtograher Oliver Wood also shot the first film, so I'm not really sure what happened.  There's a fight in an apartment during the first third of the film, and I couldn't see anything at all.  The rest of the movie was just a hair better.  If your Uncle Pete showed you a home movie shot like this, you'd turn it off in the middle.  The writing, the STORY, kept me riveted, but the movie I made in my head is much better than the schizophrenic, 40-jump-cuts-a-minute film I just watched.Which is not to say the film should have been a prettily-shot, sterile Hollywood production.  I understand they were going for gritty.  I think they overshot their goal.... and I'm not mad at them, I'm just really kind of irritated.  You could've handed the camera to someone else, Uncle Pete. It doesn't make you any less of a man.",8,1,3,24 July 2004
Hustle & Flow," Everybody Gotta Have a Dream
","Think back to the days of the 'blaxploitation' film. Now imagine if one of these films had production values, a real budget and a professional crew, all the things a modern Hollywood movie takes for granted. Now imagine the lead is not just a solid actor, but a revelation, so good that he makes every actor around him elevate their game into something mythic. If you had all that, you may just end up with 'Hustle & Flow.'The film isn't perfect; D.J. Qualls stumbles in his dramatic scenes, and Anthony Anderson is only good at playing Anthony Anderson. Those two aside, every actor absolutely vanishes into the roles they play (though Taraji Henson as the pregnant Shug does waver back and forth, occasionally overdoing it) and the result is a powerful, real, absolutely watchable film for anyone who just loves a strong, character-driven story. These aren't the cartoons we're used to watching in movies about 'the streets'; these are real people, they exist, and anyone who says different has never ventured out of the suburbs.Despite the problem actors, they do each get at least one moment where they are just as real as those around them. And Terrence Howard is a revelation, though I'm surely not the first person to say it. I didn't see this movie because of the reviews, I saw it because of Howard's performance in 'Crash' and the trailer for 'Idlewild.' He's got a presence, and he lives and breathes this role in a movie that is almost, but not quite up to him, which is exactly like Charlize Theron in 'Monster,' or Hilary Swank in 'Boys Don't Cry,' or Denzel Washington in 'Training Day.' The movies are very good. The actor radiates.A quarter-century after the death of blaxploitation cinema, the African-American film movement is in a shambles. Spike Lee and John Singleton only have one good movie, each, to their names, and the Hughes Brothers have moved out of black cinema and into a different genre entirely. There are powerful stories to tell about the black culture, about the black experience, and this pulls no punches, telling what could be a true story as if it WERE the truth, because it IS the truth... uplifting in parts, brutally ugly in others.How proud was I, then, that writer/director Craig Brewer had such an incredible story to tell, and finally, at long last, that culture has a name and a face to do it right in cinema. And then I see an interview with the guy, and he's a middle-aged, bald white cat.Like D. Jay says, man. Everybody gotta have a dream.",9,0,1,22 February 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A Southern Odyssey
","I have nothing bad to say about this film at all.  The acting was dead-on, the best performance given by Clooney, EVER, South Park cameos notwithstanding.  The visuals and soundtrack were entirely too much fun, and 100% unique to the era that this movie was released into.What else could we expect from the Coen brothers, who have been creating completely original visions since the mid-1980's?  The story is a wonderful spin on Homer's 'The Odyssey,' and cribs several characters and events from the ancient tale.  If there were any complaint about this film at all, it would be the (few) liberties it takes with the poet's tale, but it still makes for an epic film, the kind of loopiness that was missing from 'The Newton Boys' (remember that one?), or certain modern day remakes of classic stories.A 10/10 on this one-- sheer mindless, random fun, but still grounded in reality... exactly as Homer would have dictated it.",10,1,1,15 January 2001
