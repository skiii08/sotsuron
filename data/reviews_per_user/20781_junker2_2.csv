Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Adolescent Fun
","As a fan of the first trilogy, I was rather disappointed by this effort. The Phantom Menace is really nothing more than a piece of adolescent fluff (albeit a looong one).  There is no doubt that the visuals are impressive (especially the exciting lightsaber duels), but one can't help but get the feeling that this computer generated imagery will date even faster than the models of the original SW (just look at Jurassic Park). In all, fun for the kids, but a disappointment for those of us over 16. Still, I probably should have known that no movie could live up to the hype that surrounded this particular release.",6,0,1,3 August 1999
Independence Day," Fireworks but no substance
","This movie just seems to get worse every time you see it.  In the cinema, it's a bit of fun (if you don't don't think about it too much), and the visuals are very impressive.  They do not, however, make up for the stereotypical characters and almost sickening patriotism, which is especially obvious from the point of view of a non-American.  This movie has become the epitome of the big-budget blockbuster: plenty of escapist action, but no soul.",4,5,8,4 August 1999
