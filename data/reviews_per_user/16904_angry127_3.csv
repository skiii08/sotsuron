Black Swan," Pretty Much Perfect
","I was not expecting that a Ballet movie would be one of the most disturbing horror movies I've seen in a while. Its quite intentional that the film gives off this impression. Just look at all the shots of the mirrors in the film. How many times do scissors and knives appear? There are multiple broken finger and toe nails throughout the movie. And, seeing the ballerinas on their tippy toes has a always made me a little queasy. But I'm digressing to some extent, since the point of all the suspense and horror is completely essential to the movie.Like many Aronofsky films, things start out nice and simple. Then disorder comes in as the second law of thermodynamics predicts and things all go to hell. The movie takes place in only a few places (probably 4 or 5 locations). There are few characters in the movie of consequence. It feels a lot like a play adapted to film. Or perhaps even a ballet? I was not very taken with the Ballet shots earlier in the movie, as I'm not a fan. But, I quickly was drawn in to how the dances Natalie Portman performs reflects on the psychological and professional state of her character. Soon, I was at the edge of my seat hoping she would not fall or something bad would happen. The dancing scenes become extremely intense. A lot of this has to do with Natalie Portman's acting. I was never a big fan of hers. After seeing this, I think she is a really gifted actress. She plays the part of the white swan so well. She is always at the teetering edge completely scared and hopelessly trying to forestall any type of failure. After reading a little bit of her biography, she may not be acting at all in the movie.The film is extremely consistent and the ending has the payoff you would expect. Before the end happens you are wondering what will actually happen. The film does a very good job at keeping what possible scary outcomes always under some sense of skepticism.",9,2,8,29 December 2010
The Natural," Good Movie
","I'm not a real baseball or sports fan. I did like this movie though. I think just about any movie starring Robert Redford will at least be OK. This movie is no exception.The film is kind of melodramatic though. It seems like every scene there is a woman dressed in black poisoning Redford. Or there is a woman in white inspiring him to hit the ball out of the park. And speaking of which, there are probably half a dozen scenes where Redford is down two balls and he hits it out of the park.Putting that aside, the movie still has a lot to offer. The acting (besides Bassinger) is very well done. We also have Duvall, Brimley, Prosky, and Farnesworth giving stellar performances. This is probably the best part of the film, with a close second being the cinematography. All the shots are great eye candy. The glare of the sun, the farmland, the fields (with great color composition). This is really something to see.",6,7,11,9 December 2010
Donnie Darko," Bits and Pieces
","This film is really a great accomplishment. It has started its own movement and some lackluster mock offs (see Chumscrubber). I think the film is best taken in as its constituent parts. There are some scenes in this movie that really have a bite to them. They really stick out as these great little vignettes. I'm thinking for instance of the first dining room scene with the Darko family. Or perhaps when Donnie is first hypnotized by his therapist.The ebb and flow of the movie works great as well. The whole time travel bit really fits in and gives the movie a spooky theme throughout.Even more importantly may be the theme and impact of the movie. Sometimes to put yourself in someone elses (or a type of person's) shoes, you need to break out of the element of both you and that person. In this case we're breaking out of our element into the movie and out of the element of a troubled teen into one of a young man faced with the issue of the fate of those around him and the paradoxes of time travel. In a spooky kind of way this gives us the feel of what it feels like to go through the early years of high school. Although it doesn't look like it at points, it certainly feels like it. And unlike many other movies, this really places us in that universe.",8,0,2,9 December 2010
