Iron Man 3," Disappointed!!!
","Yesterday saw it in a IMAX screen and I have to say I was left disappointed and guilty for taking my friends with me. First of all RDJ was Excellent as Tony and rest of the cast was good but.......the best performance of the movie goes to Ben Kingsley!Yes best role for comedy! I dunno but kept wondering why did Marvel screwed IM's Mythology so bad that many fans will be frustrated! To be frank this IM was Irrelevant and bad than first two. Shane Black pretty much screwed this movie and mythology . Guy Pearce was good ,but really Dude!!! Men breathing FIRE?????Everybody is talking about how humorous IM3 is but it was good at first but became repeating.(I think Black thought to top The Avengers but You got to leave such work to Pros!)This movie should be contender for best comedy of the Year. That wraps up! My first review and why did I bother to write it because to save your money! I would be happy if they showed IM1 at cinema but To be Frank If YOU LOVE IM and his MYTHOLOGY , DO NOT BOTHER OR YOU WILL BE LEFT DISAPPOINTED AND BETRAYED!!!!Mail your opinions to touqir.sk@gmail.com",8,14,29,29 April 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Is this really that Bad???
","So Internet blew up BvS with mediocre reviews, As of writing this review it is sitting at 31% on RT (even less than FF4: Rise of silver Surfer). Is it that bad?? Nope... Is it that good?? Nope.. What I can tell you is that I thoroughly enjoyed it much more than Avengers:AOU, Forget the stupid reviews ,Go in with an open mind, keep your expectation in check, You will enjoy it most of the time. Top notch acting from everybody except Jesse Eisenberg who at times feels odd.Pacing of Ist half is on slower side.Give it a chance people,but do not miss it...How many times can you see Batman manhandle Superman??? Even though he is kind of a **ck in movie(Also look out for cameo of Flash ...The first one)",7,1,4,24 March 2016
