Casablanca," Timeless
","I saw this movie for the first time 56 years after it was first made and it could still move me with intensity.  There's something simple and pure about the way it evokes its emotional power, somehow never losing that power over time.  Also, I must say that Humphrey Bogart suddenly became the single man I wanted to be like after watching this film, more than Sean Connery, more than James Dean.  He has this coolness which remains the pinnacle.  True, this style and character is much better shown in The Maltese Falcon.  In Casablanca Bogart is exposed; his coldness came from a broken heart, and he still has some of that compassion left within him. But I still look up to him, and deeply feel for him.",10,0,0,16 September 1998
2001: A Space Odyssey," THE Directorial Masterpiece
","Stanley Kubrick reaches the height of his directorial genius with this movie.  There is no movie like it in existence.  The closest thing I can think of is Fantasia because of the intense junction of the visual with the soundtrack and because of the otherwise silence of the film.  As a science fiction film it is far more accurate scientifically than most movies made today.  Also, the special effects are amazing even if we don't consider that it was made in the 60's.  Stanley Kubrick paints some very beautiful pictures in this movie.  His sense of a pure mood which pervades the movie is one of his greatest achievements.  And the movie is also very though -provoking and compelling.  There are many scenes in the movie which are unforgettable, and as a homogenous whole it is a masterpiece.",10,1,4,16 September 1998
