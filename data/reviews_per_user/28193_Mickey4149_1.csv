The King's Speech," BORING movie
","Seriously, we go to the movies for entertainment. This movie is so boring, I mean they're literally just sitting in rooms talking to one another. Sometimes you watch a movie and feel really inspired after watching it. I was expecting this to be one of them, but all I wanted to do after this movie was go to sleep because it felt like a huge waste of time. There's like one good moment in the film and it lasts one minute - the part when the king swears in a humorous tone. I'm not saying people should watch over-the-top visual action movies but come on, this movie is hella boring. And yes I understood all of it. Just my opinion, I know there's a bunch of people who are in love with this movie and that's fine.",1,2,11,20 June 2014
