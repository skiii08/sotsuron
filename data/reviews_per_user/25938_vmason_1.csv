The Ring," Gripping, but lacking something
","The Ring is a very gripping film, it will certainly have you engrossed the whole way through. I enjoyed it and thought the acting was good, especially Naomi Watts. I felt it had a 'Sixth Sense' feel to it though, the eeriness and the plot. The only flaw I can find in the film is the way in which it felt unfinished at the end. The story-line throughout did not fall into place at the end, although I am aware they may be leaving that for The Ring 2, but all the same. I'm a regular cinema-goer and enjoy most films, from Shrek to Lord of the Rings to films like The Ring and would give it 6/10. It's well worth seeing.",6,0,1,28 February 2003
