Walk the Line," Amazing!
","Without a doubt the best movie I have seen in a long time and the only movie I have ever paid to see twice. Joaquin Phoenix was able to capture the essence of the man in a way that gave me chills, another first. Reese Witherspoon is beautiful as June. When given the task of portraying such an iconic couple, the best that can be done is to be as true as possible to the spirit of the individual(s). I think this movie was able to capture that truth. The fact that both actors did their own vocals only added to the sincerity of the film. Nobody will ever sound like Johnny Cash and Joaquin didn't try to. He was able to find his own depth and richness much like Johnny did. An imperfect voice, an imperfect man.",10,0,1,29 November 2005
