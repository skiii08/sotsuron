War Dogs," Propagand at the end spoiled it for me
","Spoiler alert !The story was good, but i really don't buy the last part of it. When they state this:'This case now serves as a case study for the procurement department of Pentagon'.This states a big red flag for me as there were also used American war equipment in the film (Hum Vees, helicopters etc) which probably means that the Pentagon had a editors role in the making.Another red flag is the general bookkeeping faults at the Pentagon.
