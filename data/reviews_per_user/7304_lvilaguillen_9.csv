The King's Speech," Oscar-winning King should be the tagline
","Well... just by giving a 10 out of 10, do I have to say more? Do I have to spell it out for you? At this point it really doesn't matter what I'm gonna say but what you've seen... this movie shows what effort can do... to be more redundant (according to this topic, of course)... this movie is shouting every possible emotion on every character, and believe me, there was no problem on talking here. Colin Firth, keeps surprising me with every movie he takes part in. But, talking just in this case, what an amazing performance! Shyness, bad temper, impotence, medical problems, self-conscience issues, past traumas, inexperience in some cases, and that sense of great responsibility (it resembles to Lion King's Simba for this kind of feeling, ''I cannot be what I am''), all these feelings gathered and mixed in a chaotic way within Colin's character, and every one of them better than the other you've just seen. Perfect, in each and every single way to say it, JUST SAY IT: PERFECT PERFORMANCE, TOTALLY CHAOTICALLY PERFECT. Colin, you've got the whole responsibility with your character, and madly well done. Geoffrey Rush takes a lot in this movie too, I'm not forgetting him. Of course no. He keeps this chaotic mixture and transforms it into a perfectly done puzzle of a great King image. A great performance too. Good man, good job! And of course Helena B.Carter, of course... the most believable serious character she've ever done! At first it was such a weird thing to know he was nominated for her supporting role here, because she was always as crazy (in the good way) as Tim Burton... you know what I mean. But here, unstoppable. Like a perfect royal lady must be. Music made by the same compositor from the last 2/3 Harry Potter movies (Alexandre Desplat) who is new at this. But he's growing, day by day. Such a good job too. No doubts, 12 Oscars belong here... KING SIZE.",10,0,3,12 February 2011
Sucker Punch," More than expected
","Well, at first i though ''another naked warrior girls movie'' but this is way too far from my point of view. It's really great talking about effects, really good they are! The performance of the actresses is credible and well done. You know and believe they're suffering for something... and the trials to scape are really an effort for them. I think they have really good scenes, but in some parts they abused with that ''Matrix'' slow motion effect. But in all the other ways is really worthy to be seen. Is not only meant for men, but for everyone, because it has good performances, credible characters, almost perfect effects, really outstanding music (a lot of them are remixed songs, really gorgeous!) and a lot of action mixed with drama everywhere. Also... a ''really unexpected ending'' really... as tag line says ''you won't expect it'' =)",6,4,10,24 March 2011
Life of Pi," An Outstanding Work Of Art
","When I went to watch this movie, of course in 3D in the big screen, I just knew it was gonna be brilliant. And it was. In fact is the first time I can tell the 3D effect accomplishes what 3D effects are meant to accomplish: To involve you even more in the movie... I've read out there in Metacritic a guy saying ''you don't watch this movie, you just live it'' and that's what I felt exactly. In many cases, like the storms, the whale and many others I felt so involved in the movie I could almost touch things! The storm was perfect, one of the best storms put in film. So... effects in this movie are just PERFECT. Period. It really worths the 3D. Acting is also very pleasant and nice. The 3 actors playing the role of Pi are amazing. They've got the essence of the character perfectly. Sometimes I even forgot I was watching 3 different performances. The side characters, while not as important as Pi... are so nice and likable too. Really got involved with the family, very realistic. The romance with the girl was subtle but really nice. In this case I can add Ang Lee really knows how to tell the story... I mean, it was a book before, so Ill give credit to the actual writer. But talking about the movie... they never stay so much in the things they're not the focus. The focus is the Life Of Pi, which I can tell, I just loved how resumed is the title, it tell everything in the movie without saying anything at all. That's what a good title should tell by start. The art, again, outstanding. They really deserve that cinematography Oscar. Scenes are unbelievable, you can see they decisions they made in every single case... they were in everything. Talking about the bas stuff, just a little, maybe the CGI was obvious in some cases... you could tell whenever the Tiger was real or CGI. But it was subtle, I guess it's OK anyway. The music was really delightful, what disappointed me a bit is the lack of personality in this... I mean i remember is kinda ''epic-Indian music'' I remember the flutes... but nothing more. Don't get me wrong, is really nice to hear and follows perfectly the story, but is not memorable. You can hear this kind of themes in a lot of Indian based stories... when I knew they won an Oscar for the soundtrack... I though I would here something really memorable, like that melodies that stick hard to your mind. But it was good anyway. A really amazing tale, epic some times, lovely. It reminds me a lot of the Big Fish. It doesn't matter the story, at the end you decide what to believe. And believe me and go to check this one out! In 3D if possible!",8,2,5,11 March 2013
Tangled," One word... Disney!
","One word came to my mind when I saw this magnificent work of art: Disney. Then I just knew how was it gonna be... what a beautiful movie! what a great characters! As many of you I'm gonna sound repetitive but... it surely worths it... Disney's classics are back. And there's no Pixar in here... no mates, that was all Disney! What we have here is a real Disney Princess (not like that sad intend to go back in time with The Princess and The Frog), a real one. With a dream, with a lovely voice, and no boundaries! Who wants to go beyond and beyond... and what is most important... she takes us with her! I felt there inside from the very beginning until the end. And of course without adding the fact that there's unexpected parts: no one can say that the end (you know what I mean, not to spoiler you) was expected... TOTALLY AWESOME! (when I've got here in fact I felt like you all were reading my mind!!! All of us where in the same theater, in front of the same screen the whole movie). My speech is intended to transmit all my passion! Would you mind reading?",10,20,22,14 January 2011
Unknown," Good Thriller, surprising end
","You all know because of the trailers that there's a man how is a doctor and travels to Gewrmany with his wife. Then there's a car accident, after then he remember who he is, but no one seem to know him, including his wife, and there's a new ''him'' replacing him. Then it gets kinda weird when you see the other woman related (Diane Kruger) telling something like ''you shouldn't be here'' of some kind of advice. You start to think it's more than a problem of memory... or whatever. Starting with this there's a lot of possibilities. Maybe he's crazy, maybe the've replaced him for something else, maybe not. Is in some way related to Flightplan starting with a daughter missing and people saying that she have never existed. You don't know what to think or where to take your mind to. If I said more I'd spoil it. So... you have the trailer, the idea and a relation with another movie. A good movie, with good visual effects, music, catching, perturbing... it has you always in action, waiting for something to happen, and then happens another thing, it doesn't give you a break, always running from someone of something else. Interesting ending, really good.",8,2,9,19 February 2011
Green Street Hooligans," Our humanity, just like this
","By first... I was kinda reluctant to watch this movie, don't ask, because I dunno know why. Then I've watched it. Well, at first it looks like Elijah Wood (don't remember the character name right now) is just a really pathetic ''yankee'', who seems to be overprotected in his past... and of course, as you see, is a good person to mess with. Then it comes the part of discrimination from England guys, this kinda ''football gangsters'', a ''really not much helping'' sister, her ''arrogant'' and ''over-reacting'' England husband (well... Claire Forlani - the sister - is in fact English, not American, weird), and a poor young baby of them. In this general flash of the very beginning, you can see a weird movie. Then suddenly becomes interesting, you can see how pathetic is nationalism and racism in every each and single way, and makes you understand what it really is: a way of control. England vs. Northamerica, gangsters vs. other football gangs, friends betrayed... a lot of violence. It's good the message it leaves: not to trust anyone and not to mess with that people. But... at least, they are back for each other and stand when there's a challenge or a fight or whatever... what our ''yankee'' guy (don't misunderstand me, I'm not being racist, hate that word, I'm only emphasizing this word because of the movie itself) understands and learns how to protect himself and what real friendship means (another could be... the best friend is not who shares his room with you, could be... is who never leaves you alone)... good movie after all... what I need to say, because I noted quickly (as a lot of people...) is the credits... Elijah Wood is the ''well-known'' there... but he's the last actor to appear in the list... so... you know, you can note there the ''english nationalism''... hehe, ironic world. Don't take this review as a way of racism please, just intended to be realistic. Liked the movie anyway, of course. Well done, good story-telling, believable characters, believable suffering...",7,0,0,18 February 2011
Taken," Super-mixture of Intensity-action-reality-details!
","A lot of action!! a lot of good well-performed shots and fights... credible, all of them based on little details, in fact this movie is about action and details, all the few details, even if they are almost invisible are what develop in a believable action scene! There's also scenes that take your breath away, like ''I cannot believe'' or ''wow, now I understand what he (Liam's character) really feels''... incredible, well-done and credible action scenes, well-chosen actors, and deep intense feelings about parents relations, families, incredibly disturbing images, but real, sadly, madly REAL! Good Job!! Not Oscar-winning movie, but a really good one... entertainment, excitement... , with a perseverance character which can go beyond everything to rescue what he loves the most...",9,0,1,21 February 2011
Thor," Much more than a special effects movie
","At first... when my boyfriends asked me to go to see this movie, both of us though ''I think is just another action, special effects and so on movie, but at least, it'd be entertaining''. Then, our theory broke down... I mean the sightseeing of Asgard it's not just effects, it's WOW! Then the story starts... normally, with a ''supposly to be'' hero, his kingdom, then he's taken to Earth... and you think is just a strange guy on a strange place... but is not just like that. We have a lot of funny things here, the guy is not just ''bad and arrogant and period'', he's more complex, like a person is. This is what a lot of heroes movie don't have. The bad guy is not only bad, and is not only a matter of revenge what takes him out of control. There's a lot of facts that makes him do what he does. CHARACTERS: 7 So... the characters are deeper than any hero character, and they have more than 1 simple and chic-heed explanation to do everything the do, and to feel everything they feel. EFFECTS: 9 So impressive, gorgeous, outstanding...!! I won't spoil it for you... it has no sense if you don't see it... STORYLINE: 7 Quite good for a hero standard movie, deep characters, good fight scenes, action, fluent relation lazes... believable story. Magic and imagination... epic love... tension... MUSIC: 6 It doesn't have enough identity for the movie, but it's really nice, and powerful!! It goes perfectly with the action that is happening!",7,0,2,5 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The best of the saga, epic finale!
","The best of the saga. How can I say as a Harry Potter freak? Well, not a freak for real, but more or less this. The final is epic, and the characters are developed right to them top... maybe I still can say Harry is not well enough played by Dan Radcliffe but it still good and he improved a lot. Great scenes from Alan Rickman (one of the best in my opinion). Deep and tender, even sad story from him, of course it comes from Rowling. But still good. Also the battles, every each and single little one is epic, and shows what each wizard is capable to do for real. You have not to think anymore, now you have the proves. Maggie Smith, epic too. TOO EPIC, the best of the best!",10,1,2,19 July 2011
