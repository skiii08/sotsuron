Skyfall," The best Bond movie so far!!
","The opening sequence is the best one I have ever seen. The movie is dark, powerful and has a good plot. Silva (Rodriguez) is one of the most likeable and charismatic villains ever and the finale in Skyfall is just spectacular and has a western-like vibe.
Not having a 'real' Bondgirl doesn't hurt the movie at all.",9,1,4,12 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Great but there are some issues!
","When I walked out of the theatre I was really pleased with what I had seen( not a 10/10, but a good 9). But the more I thought about it the more weak points I could spot. There were some scenes that made me feel very angry, like all the stuff they have done to my favourite hero Thor. It was funny at first but later it just got on my nerves and made me (and all other fans of him) aggressive. There were also some scenes where the writers just found conclusion that were too easy compared to the problems that had been there. The movie also had some holes in its plot and things that just didn't seem very logic. But the start was great and all in all Marvel delivered very well. All in all it was a very good and enjoyable movie with some very emotional moments.",7,2,3,28 April 2019
