First Man," Curiously intimate study of a deeply stoic character.
","Phenomenal, starkly realistic depiction of the events leading up to the Apollo 11 moon landing and the historic trip itself. Really gets into the characters and personalities of the astronauts and families, especially of course protagonist Neil Armstrong. Unlike 'Apollo 13' which is great, this movie really puts you there, from the opening sequence of an Armstrong supersonic test flight out of the atmosphere.",8,0,0,8 June 2020
Rear Window," Outstanding Film.
","A masterclass in storyboarding and art direction, Hitchcock manages to squeeze tension and drama from simply being a nosy neighbour.",9,1,1,21 March 2020
