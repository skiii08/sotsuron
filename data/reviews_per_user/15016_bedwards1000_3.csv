Ali," Three People Asleep on a Couch
","Plot: No Story: No Acting: Average Boxing: Not Really Dialog: No, and what there was, was hard to hear. If you didn't already know the story this movie is not going to help you out.",1,10,20,10 June 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Plot - Don't bother
","The action, acting and realism were about as compelling as a high quality Playstation game but the plot wasn't quite as deep.  Really, I usually agree with most whether a movie is good or not but I can't see what anybody gets out of this.  It didn't even hold the attention of the kids who love martial arts flicks.  The fight sequences were so unrealistic and choreographed that they made a Jackie Chan movie look like a documentary.  As for the plot, a love affair that should not be, intermixed with a stolen relic.  Oh, that's a new one.  I've never seen anything like that before.  Well maybe not EXACTLY the same as this movie.",1,36,73,5 November 2001
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," I can't imagine why people liked this movie.
","I'll start by saying that I really enjoy a stupid comedy. The 40 year old virgin was great! So, with a similar cast and some decent reviews (and some bad ones) I thought this movie had a pretty good chance. Nope, sorry, I didn't make it through the first 30 min before I realized that life is too short and I had a closet to paint. I could still hear the movie where I was and I am sure that it didn't get any better. The characters were flat despite their quirks, the gags appealed to the age group between 13 & 15 and the whole thing just couldn't hold my interest. I won't give any spoilers because there is absolutely nothing to spoil.",2,3,6,13 April 2006
