Ghost," Who You Gonna Call?
","This film has always been one of my favorites. From start to finish it just takes you on a roller-coaster of emotions. The heartfelt passion and symbolic love-gestures taken on by the characters and expressed in deeply profound and moving ways just makes my very flesh electric with giddiness. When the first ghost appeared in the library I was genuinely frightened, but with timely doses of humor, the fabulous cast of actors got me through it just fine. My favorite character in the movie would have to be Peter Venkman. Played by a charming Bill Murray, Venkman handles the responsibilities of friendship with three coworkers and Dana Barrett, his love interest with startling believability. I to wish I could have friends as whimsical and intelligent as Spengler, Stantz, and Zedmore. It must be difficult to run a ghost-catching service and still have time for the little things in life like romance and everlasting friendships. When I first saw this film Slimer the ghost really spooked me out big time. Now I see he is just comic relief, and he like us the moviegoer are just along for the ride, and what a ride it is.",Null,0,0,8 August 2006
Finding Nemo," Come On People! Pixar Doesn't Always Equal Pure Genius
","Aww gee golly gosh kids pile into the mini-van cuz we're gonna go see that cute lookin' new Pixar film, you know the one where that adorable little fish is lookin' for that other fish, you know little Nemo, gosh darn is that Nemo ever cute. And you know it's a Pixar movie so it'll be fun for us grownups and you kids too. Aww look at little Nemo, he's got a disablility kids, but that missin' fin doesn't stop him from doin' the things that those baby fish just hafta do you know. What a powerful message for my young children. Oh Ellen Degeneres is the voice of a fish in it, ya know you could do a lot worse than Ellen Degeneres. Surfs up dudes, those surfer turtles were sure some kinda fun for me and my kids. What a happy ending, that was pleasing. Admit it people this movie treks on some heavily traveled ground. It wasn't original at all, and not to mention would only be funny if the only thing you've ever seen were a few old Full House episodes. Sure kids may enjoy it, but it seems like very little effort was put into making this movie besides the top notch animation. Too many people seem to blindly give high ratings to animated features just because they were made by Pixar. Bottom line is this movie is for kids and humorless adults.",5,1,3,22 February 2006
Aliens," IMDb Payed Me To Write This Favorable Review
","I will start off my review like everyone else who thinks they are special because they are familiar with the works of a particular director. You know the types, those that like to mention the director just because they are famous. Those who badmouth them because they are well known. 'James Cameron is a good friend of mine cuz I saw four of his movies, so I have so much important insight that I must share with you. I saw Aliens before most of you people ever did, I saw it back in 1990. That was before James Carmeron was famous so I'm kind of a long-time fan of his I guess, because you know, I really liked Aliens way back in 1990 before he or the movie was popular. He's not as good a director as he used to be sez me the world's biggest J. Cameron fan. That's right, I call him J. Cameron cuz we're close friends and all. Now onto my review which is really important for you to read because I'm an American from America. Burke is evil, he is upsettingly evil. End Spoiler. I will continue this review by pretending that I am writing this while being trapped in a 24 foot deep well in my backyard. This is the last message I will ever have for my family and friends as I have been trapped in this well for three days now and am surprisingly dying of dehydration because this well was empty, oh just my luck to fall into a dry well. Anyways, from what I can remember of the James Cameron film Aliens, I remember enjoying it greatly, oh so thirsty. I hope this package of skittles can tide me over until help arrives. Aliens is truly a Cameron tour de force, oooh I like the lime ones, delicious, back in 1990 when I saw this film I thought this Cameron character is really going places, who the hell has a well in their backyard now a days, I mean come on. The suspense of this movie puts my senses in maximum overdrive, which reminds me of the movie Roadhouse which I am not familiar with. Don't wells usually contain mushrooms, bats, or roaches, there's nothing in this well but pea gravel, this sucks. And that's why the ending to Aliens was so surprising. Lance Henriksen steals the show. feel dizzy, power loader battle sequence felt tacked on...., mouth ,so dry, James Cameron save me.......tell my family about Lance henriksen.ek,.qegu;////////////",9,1,5,5 August 2006
Tombstone," They Fought For Justice And For Billy Zane
","Whatever happened to Billy Zane? I mean that guy was going to be huge, Macaulay Culkin huge. Well anyways, Tombstone is the classic western tale of the Earp brothers seeking an early retirement in the SouthWest I think, and upon finding it decide to clip on their badges one last time in the name of justice. The evil Curly Bill (that doesn't sound so evil) and his red rag gang run amok in the Earp's newly found retirement heaven. Soon things get out of control, a few deaths are involved, and vengeance is sought, then found, then forgotten just in time for retirement #2, which costars Dana Delany. Crazy run-on sentences abound and commas come flyin' from out of nowhere. The movie itself is very solid and tells a cromulent story that is sure to embiggen the hearts of all who witness it. The acting is darn good especially Russell and Kilmer who definitely steal the show. Billy Zane however is still missing. If you have any information on his whereabouts please contact the Unwanted Actors Outreach Center, Gary Busey will be standing by to take your phone calls, and yes he will try and talk to you for a long time because he has been forgotten by the general public and needs your attention. Tragic isn't it.",7,0,1,20 February 2006
