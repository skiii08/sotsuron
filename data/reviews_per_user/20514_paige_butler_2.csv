Hereditary," Best horror of the year!
","This is the type of horror that leaves you feeling messed up and thinking about it. I would honestly say this film is on par with icons such as the exorcist. It is so disturbing and the whole film makes you feel scared to your bones. I definitely recommend, a must see.",10,0,3,21 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," I saw this an hour ago and I'm still shaking!
","This movie is literally perfect, from the soundtrack to the editing, the acting especially, everything is amazing. I honestly didn't know I could love a movie so much! I cried at least twice, and it has the best fight scene in marvel history. No spoilers, but the ending will leave you feeling satisfied, like you've just watched the end of an era. Truly a fantastic era. Thank you Stan.",10,2,5,25 April 2019
