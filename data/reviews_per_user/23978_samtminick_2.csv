Alien 3," Give it another chance!
","Most people agree that when they saw this for the first time it was very disappointing. I remember feeling it was a step in the wrong direction and was a weak and anti-climactic ending to the series after the over-the-top action fest of aliens(2).But after watching it again this year I realized that it is not bad at all compared to the AVP movies. I would even go as far as to say that it is a better movie than Alien Resurrection in that it carries the deep sensation of foreboding and helplessness that created the Alien mystique in the first place.In retrospect, I'd say its worth a solid 7.0",7,2,2,15 July 2011
A Clockwork Orange," More than Just a Movie, See it again!
","Don't be put-off by the ultra-violence in A clockwork Orange, this film is a satirical masterpiece that works on many levels. I would argue that, given the proper consideration, this film rivals 2001: A Space Odyssey in its ability to amaze, albeit in a converse way. Being a Kubrick film the cinematography is second to none, even if the synthesizers and set pieces feel very 70's today. The visuals are as woefully disturbing as they are beautiful, and really portray a world as seen only through Alex's eyes. Malcolm McDowell's performance gives meaning to the term 'born for the role.'The story contains a multitude of themes, from political (freewill vs. government control), sociological (the hypocrisy of modern society), and philosophical (morality and how we define good and evil), offers a damning commentary on behavioral psychology, and is fraught with a fiendish irony. You might describe this film as an Orwellian-like warning about the dangers of government control on free will. But it is also a dark philosophical take on the nature of mankind, the essence of the human soul, and the evil that dwells somewhere inside us all. Sociopathic Alex may be pure evil, but he is as pure as the music of lovely, lovely, Ludwig Van. Leave it to Stanley Kubrick to show us the good in evil.Many people will never be able to get past its graphic sexual violence and arguably pessimistic view of mankind, and I can understand this. While I agree the images are very disturbing and can make it hard to watch, I believe judging this film based solely on this aspect is missing the point. It took 2 or 3 viewings for me to fully realize everything that was going on, and I still find the story very compelling.While I have not read the book, I understand the film omits the last chapter, and this changes the ending significantly. I prefer the ending of the film because it leaves the story more open to interpretation. This is also part of what makes the film so daring, even today. How often do you see a film that offers this much food for thought? Truly a work of art from a man who pushed the boundaries of the medium.",10,1,3,29 December 2011
