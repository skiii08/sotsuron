The Legend of Bagger Vance," I enjoyed it. Touching.
","I finally got around to see this movie and now I'm sorry for the wait. It was visually incredible. The acting, on the most part, was good. Most naysayers will complain that it was boring, or that they were confused about who (or what) Bagger really was. I thought it worked fine the way it was. The mystery of Bagger lent itself to the story. I'm not much of a golfer and I'm not one who will watch it on TV, but I inspired now to play more golf.All I can say is that immediately after watching it I ordered a copy for my collection.",9,1,3,11 January 2003
Catch Me If You Can," Worthwhile. Enjoyable.
","Based on a true story, 'Catch Me If You Can' is an enjoyable film. The acting is good. Leo was OK, Hanks was great, but Christopher Walken stoled the show. I can't remember the last time he gave a subpar performance. Spielberg's direction was appropriate and reminded me of what a good story teller he is.Overall, I give it an 8/10, but Walken should get an Oscar nomination for his work as the father.",8,1,1,28 December 2002
