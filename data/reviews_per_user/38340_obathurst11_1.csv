The Monuments Men," A War Story That Will Be Joining My Collection.
","The Monuments Men was a fantastic story of men who were trying to save human civilizations history in the wake of a war. The introduction, while yes it did go on, allowed us to understand the characters, allowing us, as viewers to make a emotional connection with these characters, making it more heartbreaking when one of them died. I found that I was drawn more and more to the stories of the pieces of art they were trying to save. A tear actually rolled down my cheek when they found Michelangelo's Madonna with Child statue in the mine. The movie gave me an understanding of these men and the want to know more.I thought that, while perhaps it may have not been as action packed as expected that, perhaps it hit the mark in actually telling a tale of war that has not yet been touched. They were innocent men, kept out of the war for multiple reason, but dedicated to finding, restoring and return the world's stolen art and ultimately the history of earth's culture and past. I also thought that the casting was brilliant. We knew the faces, it was an all star cast, and they portrayed the characters perfectly. I did not however completely LOVE the story line between James and Claire, I feel the cuts to their story were rather annoying. I liked more of the others, finding the art and dealing with the effects of war. Ultimately, I loved this war story and it will join the many others I have in my collection when it is released on DVD.",8,2,4,31 March 2014
