Blade Runner 2049," Raises more questions than it answers!
","And it's not like this movie is giving you any solid information so that you could try to answer them or make up your own plausible answer. It's just as vague and unnecessarily poetic sometimes just like its predecessor. Speaking of its predecessor... I was not a fan of blade runner when I first saw it (being about a month and a half ago, and I only watched it because of the hype this movie had here). What made me angry with both this movies is that they are ambiguous and vague just for the sake of it and so they raise more questions than they answers. In one interview Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford argued about Rick being a replicant or not. And it's weird to see a director unsure of what he's done in a movie that he'll argue with that character's actor over it's humanity. It just shows how stupid and without any intelligence the original movie was made. It would be stupid from me to point out again that that movie was made just to show the visuals... as if that's the most important thing in a movie. This movie is no exception from that and it's actually worst than the first one. I'll focus now on what went wrong and what was good in this movie.The story: is so sloppy that the first time I watched it, I fell asleep. So the way this movie is constructed is that scenes jump from one to the other without any real exposition as to why or how. The viewer is just supposed to go along with the story sometimes because there's no development towards some scenes or if it is, is JUST TOO SLOW! and you should be focused 200%, because again the movie is vague and you need to compensate that somehow. That's one other problem I had with this movie, it's way too slow. I understand that you need to show many beautifull scenes in order to make Roger Deakins win his first Oscar but that has nothing to do with how slow this movie is and why it is. Why? Because it's a Villeneuve movie and because it's a blade runner sequel. That's two times slower pace than usual and no wonder I fell asleep the first time. Then there are way too many 'how is this happening?' or 'since when?' moments or characters that sometimes do things without any purpose or reason for it and that really destroyed the enjoyment I might had with this movie. Let's not forget about the ambiguity and mystery this movie had and its numerous question... there are certain revelations that just raised more questions about that certain character or unexplained events from the past that are just mentioned at the beginning so you might know where in time you are with this movie's story but those mentions make all the events that happened between the original and this movie feel like what happened between episode VI and episode VII of star wars, to give you a strong resemblance.The characters: really no one stood out for me. And that's because there's little to no dialogue. That could work in a movie like 'Dunkirk' where it's all about an evacuation and the urgency and realism of the situation, but here is a fictional world where you can be both realistic or artistic and entertaining, but the director chosed the first one. That's probably why this movie failed at box office too. Who would want to watch or rewatch a movie this slow and with so little motivation from its characters or little entertainment. Visuals: absolutely breathtaking and gorgeous to watch. The future displayed here is not how a future thought by a 2017 guy would look like but how the original blade runner's future would look like. The cinematography is one of the best ever and I guess no one can stop Roger Deakins from winning an oscar this year.Soundtrack: I uderstand why the director wanted a original-like music so asked Hans Zimmer to help... but this is one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard along with T2 Judgment Day. There is no musicality or depth to it. Neither is any suspense to it and it makes the movie experience all the more bad.Conclusion: Bad pacing, little dialogue, no strong character development of more characters (since this should be an epic), horrible soundtrack, great visuals, superb cinematography but overall very sloppy with it's storytelling which made me sleep, so I wouldn't recomend it to anyone. Only giving it a seven for the visuals, cinematography and Ryan's performance, the rest is garbage. 7/10PS: This movie also tried to be the start of a universe of sequels and to give ideas and plots for other blade runner movies to come... but in doing so fails to be a proper sequel.",7,1,3,31 December 2017
Black Swan," A movie lesson about self-control! (no spoilers)
","Black Swan was once again a movie I had on my 2011 Oscar highlights to watch and was also a movie I've looked forward to watching for quite some time. Black Swan is directed by Darren Aronofsky and tells the story of Nina a ballet dancer who tries to prepare as well as she can for an upcoming role while also fearing that she might go insane in the process.This was a terrific movie with a very dramatic story and great suspense. The performances first, are all top notch especially from Natalie Portman who deservedly won the Oscar in 2011. The story is polarizing. On one hand we have the realistic approach with Nina and how she copes with the role she gets, but on the other hand we see a more imaginative world in the movie taking place inside Nina's head while she is going nuts due to her role. This two are perfectly tied into one another mainly by Darren's great direction. There are times when you as an audience feel like Nina not knowing when the reality and when the imagination end and when the other one begins. This makes for a very unpredictable story which kept me involved in the movie until it's very end. Talking about the end, it's very dramatic and the way it was done only with images made me feel so much for it's characters and that is something rare in a movie to make the audience feel emotions only through images without any dialogue whatsoever. The message this movie sends towards its audience is very simple and powerfull at the same time. What would you be capabale of doing in order to fulfil your deam? Would you be willing to let yourself changed into something ugly in order to acheieve that?
Is your profession more important than your life? Would you be able to find the right balance between those two? The cinematography is extremely good in so many moments most of which are close-ups of Nina which makes the viewer more like her most of the time. The score although is more of a nonconformist score integrates very well within the movie and enhances it. The only gripes I might have with the movie is that at some points tries to transmit certain ideas that I for one did not saw them suited for this movie but overall there are a lot more other lesson to be learned from this movie along it's runtime. Another gripe I might have with the movie is that in the beginning Nina's hallucinations are somewhat random and it was hard for me to fandom what was that all about. Aside from that this movie is awesome and powerful and extremely emotional at times.Overall: a great movie with great performances, great story, powerful moments and emotions but at times somewhat polarizing in it's message. 10/10",10,1,1,14 February 2018
Your Name.," Haven't been touched so much by an anime movie since Spirited Away!
","Going into this film I knew the last scene. And that was because a problem I had with a subtitle so I had to check the last phrase of dialogue to make sure it was fully synchronized. Even though having that in my mind I cried 3 times while watching this movie. I can honestly say it was one of the best movie experiences I've ever had in my life. I haven't been so moved (at least by an anime movie) ever since I saw Spirited Away.The plot of this movie is pretty simple and the movie lets you know it from the first minute. Having said that there is so much going on and the pacing of the movie was so good, that the 1 hour and 46 minutes flew by without even noticing it. The first act was a bit more funny as the two tried to find balance within this weird situation. The second and third act however were where things begin to fall apart and quite fantastic things happen that move you, inspire you, touch you, surprise you and maybe even shock you. The funny thing about watching this movie and about my experience watching this movie is that about two years ago I've read a very interesting book about relationships and how to have a good relationship (I mean as a couple). One of the main things that stood out to me from that book was this thing: 'Love your future partner even before you met him'. And I don't know why, but while I was watching this movie I was reminded of that. For me this movie reminded me of the fact that even though you might not yet have found THAT partner, It will come and when it comes be ready to already love him and pursue that dream of being with him/her.As for technical aspects of the movie, I was astonished with how good was the animation even though it was hand made, at times some shots looked like a short real video. Absolutely stunning animation. The music was also incredible with an amazing soundtrack (musical score) and also songs with voice that were hart breaking especially due to the fact that the scenes they were in were superb as well.I can't find a single flaw with this movie. The only thing that bugged me a little was the complexity of the story especially from the second to third act. Aside from that this movie was superb in every way and it is the kind of movie that reminds us about beautiful things in life and how we can achieve those things if we pursue them and love them. 10/10",10,1,1,25 August 2019
Citizen Kane," Why is this considered as one of the best movies of all time?
","This movie was a boring mess. No subtlety that would suggest what 'rosebud' means or make the viewer realise by the end what that actually meant. So yeah... it supposed to mean the fact that chance played a big role in the outcome of Kane's life. But where is that ever mentioned in the movie? Where is this theme ever hinted at or discussed maybe by characters? It's just supposed to pop up in the viwer's head by the end of the movie?It didn't pop in my head, and I wasn't impressed by this movie. I fell asleep halfway through and had to wake up and continue. And apart from a couple of scenes of good dialogue, good performances from the actors and very good cinematography, this movie was a total letdown and a slap in the face towards anything a good movie should be about: Great story, great dialogue, great performances, great direction, great technical stuff, inspiring, thematically deep, intriguing and entertaining. Unfortunately this movie succeedes in only 3 of those things I've mentioned. So my rating will be acordingly: 4/10",4,2,5,1 September 2019
Captain Marvel," Man.. this was a boring movie!
","I watched this movie on my build-up towards Avengers: Endgame and even though I pretty much knew how people responded to this movie, I wanted to experience it for myself and make my own oppinion about it. And man this movie was boring...I'd start with the main character who apart from some flashback scenes and a couple lines was completely un-relatable. There was no emotion in her, and there were male side characters that had more emotion than her. Now, I don't know if that is due to poor writing for the character or because of bad interpretation by Brie Larson. Either way her character was bad and made me completely not care for her or her character arc (if there was one).Next, the story was polarizing. It starts with flashbacks and it gives you that kind of impression of having an untrustworthy narator. In the begining I thought 'man this is actually great and intriguing!' Then as the movie went on, the story got worse and worse with contradictions, continuity errors and so on and so forth... There was way too much history and information about other planets or about ties that the characters had with other characters that weren't fully explained (in my opinion) and I was left wandering allwawys 'who are these guys?' 'why is this guy here and plotting along with these guys?' I even went back and watched some certain scenes but still couldn't find any explanation. I guess only die-hard fans may hold the solution and since I'm not one of them, the movies should have explained that to me (in my opinion) and not rely on me having to be a comic-book nerd to know that.Superpowers: This is by far the most stupid thing in this movie. The main character is displayed to be so powerfull yet we never get an explanation as to how the power works, how the other guys' powers work, so that I as a casual viewer to understand why she beats them. No, just Deus ex Machina after Deus ex Machina. Marvel is beginning to seem more like the last jedi...The soundtrack: This one was more synthesised than other Marvel soundtracks, but it was horrible nonetheless. No cue, not even a main theme was I able to pick during the movie. Michael Giacchino for Doctor Strange and Spider-man and Alan Silvestri for Cap America and Avengers have done a way better job than who ever composed this piece of garbage.I'll not end without saying what I liked about this movie. The pacing was very good, made me enjoy the movie, and generally speaking I could follow the story just not understanding it as I would have liked. The interactions between characters was good, the CGI was fantastic especially the de-aging effects on Samuel L. Jackson were almost unnoticeable. The action and set-pieces were pretty fine and overall good, but it didn't seem like a movie that had something the other movies in the MCU didn't have up until now. It had nothing unique to it. To put it simply it was a mix of Thor plus Guardians of the Galaxy plus Iron-Man. Nothing unique about it and it makes me sad since the hero was something I was interested in.Overall I did enjoyed it somewhat but it was boring and because of lack of empathy with the main character I couldn't care for the stakes that were in this movie. Wonder Woman did a way better job, and that movie didn't try to be a feminisim propaganda.",6,0,2,25 April 2019
Zootopia," One of pixar's best ever! (No spoilers)
","Zootopia tells the story of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde who are a bunny and a fox respectively who are trying to solve a case together. I am saying this is one of pixar's best is because it is bold enough to go where other pixar movies didn't go. From the movie start I was surprised by Judy which is such a loveable character and at the same time such an optimistic person that tries to be better and better even though she fails a lot of times just like Shakira's song says in both the beginning and end of this movie. The animation is the best ever from pixar and I've seen Coco which is newer than this but in Zootopia there were some scenes in which everything seemed real, really. The voice acting is fantastic and the standouts are these two leading characters, Idris Elba and JK Simmons' characters respectively. The story is so mature and so rich with countless moral lessons for both kids and adults but the thing I loved about it is that it gave so much depth to this two characters that at a point in the movie I thought I was watching a real movie about a police case. There are so many twist and exciting moments in this film where I was either laughing very hard or shocked or amazed by the courage this movie had with the story it told. I honestly don't have a single gripe or flaw with movie and that's why for me it's one of pixar's best along with 2017's Coco. Both will probably end up oscar winners and that along with the movie themselves just proves that sometimes animated movies can be better than real movies. Oh... did I mention the score? Fantastic again from Giacchino who is becoming a master at scoring these types of movies.Amazing animaton, great voice acting, engaging story and great music make this movie one of pixar's best and one of 2016's best movies. 10/10",10,4,6,9 February 2018
Star Trek Into Darkness," Are all the reviewers old as Leonard Nimoy?
","Firstly I'll say that I'm not a fan of star trek, I hated the way the old star trek was about, especially the acting which was horrible, just a show off of the main character punching and kissing, lame! Instead I found this new series more provoking and more dynamic than the old one, even though there are some parts copied from the old one though. The best thing about the reboot is that it shows you a more modern Star Trek, which is more close to what the future may look like, even though they don't put an accent on how the technology appeared or how is the world like it is, but that's how Star Wars began as well didn't it?I have to say I enjoyed very much the first movie, even though is just action, time travel and lot of fun, even though the action isn't on a personal level is just between two worlds and their representatives. Finally, let's get to this movie that made write this review, cause all I've seen were haters who don't know how to appreciate a good effort. But yeah I guess all the reviewers are as old as Leonard Nimoy... and they are all old fashioned style.Even with that, I gotta say this movie was better than the first. Here are some reasons:1. The conflict between characters is only at a personal level, which makes a lot of place for character development and introducing.2. Action is not unnecessary, all the action scenes weren't made only for 3D effect, they were part of the bigger conflict that was between the characters. 3. the story is amazing, especially the way Khan manages to fool everyone and almost gets away with. For all the dumb people who go on write reviews without paying attention to the movie, When Khan was first zapped by Scotty, then the movie shows a glimpse of Khan pretending to sleep, just so that he could take over the ship unexpected. That was very cleverly executed.4. Then the Khan surrender, was just brilliant, cause it makes you think 'hey he's gotta be kidding' but in reality he's surrendering because he could save his crew. Again master mind script. 5. In the end my #3 point is explained, because Khan gets knocked out by a lot of stuns proving that he was pretending at the beginning.And I guess the epic fight between Spock an Khan at the end concludes a very epic and clever Star Trek movie which in my opinion is better than the first installment.Anyway, my message to all the haters of this movie is this: 'Give the movie a chance, and don't stick to much to the old series, but enjoy a well executed movie, with a lot of action and fun'. Sorry if I offended anyone. Cheers to all.",7,2,9,15 August 2014
Aquaman," Beware, this movie is not just mindless action!
","I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D (which wasn't so great btw) and honestly saying I wasn't disappointed. Many people (including the critics) have praised this movie for being only 'fun' or putting the accent on 'good old fun'. But in my opinion this movie has much more to it than that. The only reason I didn't gave this movie a ten is because overall is a bit cliched at times and overall the stakes aren't that high really, to make you surprised or mind blown by what turns this movie took along its 142 minutes run time.The story: Many people have compared this movie with 'Black Panther' or 'Lion King' but the story although being about someone who steps up to be the king of his people, is quite different. The main difference is that Arthur doesn't want to be king and his character along the journey this movie takes it, becomes more selfless and more dedicated to his people or to the saving of his people rather than on some claim he has. I'll say this: first like 20 minutes of this movie are awesome with a backstory that was touching, powerful and memorable. The movie loses its tempo only in the middle but you never lose the plot if you pay attention. I will also point out the development of Arthur's character and how a certain scene speaks so powerfully about what makes a good leader. Someone who doesn't think about himself but rather gives everything in him for his people. Very nicely executed scene, and one more reason why this movie was more than just good fun for me.The villain: Although some people said Manta wasn't actually needed in this movie, if you really pay attention to the movie you'll see he has somewhat of a role in it. But the other villain is what makes this movie good. Orm is very strong of a character and his motivations are very understandable. There's a scene between him and Arthur in Atlantis that displays all his motivation and how humans are responsible for that. For me that scene just spoke and raised the problem that we as humans continue to perpetuate upon the environment, and how we do everything that we like with it without worrying about it's degradation. Very nice and deep thematically.The supporting cast was good. Standard I would say: Vulko is the mentor, Mera is the 'partner along the journey' for Arthur, but the rest which I won't spoil for you, two characters are very good even though they don't have that much screen time. Their story is superb and touching. The soundtrack again was very nice done by Rupert Gregson Williams, but a little to loud at times.The visuals: This movie is wihtout a doubt the most visual and the most beautifully looking movie I've seen in a long long time. It is beyond me how this movie wasn't nominated by the academy (btw one of the worst nolinations this year at the academy) for visual effects and production design, which are incredible well done. The amount of work that went in it must have been crazy. I couldn't but appreciate all the visuals and the digital altered faces (which are quite a few) throughout this movie.Overall, great movie with so much fun and excitement but also with a good and flashed out villain, good character development and good enough themes throughout the movie. Well worth watching. Stay until the mid credits for the post credits scene that sets up a sequel, which hopefully will be made.",9,0,2,25 January 2019
Interstellar," Interstellar does to movies what LOST did to TV shows
","Well, let me begin by saying that the first time I watched this movie I was confused, maybe like many of the people around here who gave this movie bad reviews, but that changed last night when I watched it again, and to be honest I felt like I never seen the movie, and I really enjoyed it more than I did the first time.And to begin somewhere, I'll say again that this movie does what LOST did to TV shows, and here is why: First of all every aspect of the science of this movie is awesome, and the fact that it really speaks clearly about science in front of the viewers and shows us a very authentic dialog which involves real theories makes it very believable. And the reason why I say it's very authentic is that they actually speak in science terms, just like a doctor would speak to another doctor about medical terms. See that's why I don't like movies such as The Theory of Everything of Imitation Game, cause there the people who know science stuff speak to each other like a doctor would talk to a patient, and that makes it very unauthentic. Just imagine Kip Thorne and Stephen Hawkings would meet and instead of speaking in terms like Lorentz factor or magnetic quantum number, they speak as if they would write a poem about science stuff instead of just actually talking science and so forth... you get the idea, or at least I hope you get it.Next every detail about time dilatation and time travel is executed perfectly, and it really gives a very unique experience, at least to me it was very touching to see scenes that implied losing someone due to time dilatation, no movie really did that ever.Next I could talk and talk about the score, cinematography, directing and performances but I'll only say that Mathew McConaughey had a fantastic performance, very different, very original and touching, but yeah the Academy can't see that, they'd rather be impressed by something very simplistic and unauthentic than actually give the credit to this movie for having so many innovations, and if you want to know what were those, you can google them and see that like the rotating hallway in Inception, Nolan did something similar here too.So, what I realized after watching this movie and seeing what other people think about it, I see that people would rather prefer to not use their minds to think about a movie or about the message it transmits but rather be lazy and have the movie or TV show do that for themselves. It's a shame cause movies like this get so many bad reviews but other movies like 'The Martian' get overrated ratings, but the movie is full of dull and pathetic moments and weird circumstances. This show just how easily people are fooled and how mindless some people can be, don't wander why the world is as bad as it is, we don't think anymore...",10,2,4,28 November 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," One of the best movies of 2017! (Spoiler free review)
","I saw this movie because I knew of its Oscar buzz and I wanted to see if it's worth it. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri tels the story of Mildred Hayes who 7 months after her daughter died and with the police not doing anything to try to catch the culprit, she posts three billboards to let anyone know how incompetent the police men are. From there the whole town jumps on her and we got ourselves a movie.This movie reminded me of other great movies that I saw, because the movie itself is very realistic and very original in its concept, you know the feeling when you watch too much garbage for too long and then a diamond like this movie comes along and reminds you that there can be great movies every year. It also takes you in directions that you never expected the movie to go (I mean literally, not like Star Wars The Last Jedi where there were no new directions) and pretty much reminded me of movies like The Dark Knight or Fight Club or Shawshank Redemption for instance. I was at times 'Wow, I was completely not expecting that and that is awesome!' due to some unexpected twist and due to the fact that the story always had something new to offer and show to me. Another thing I'd like to point out are the performances which were all top-notch. Starting with Frances McDormand who was just awesome in this role and I understand why she got nominated for an oscar (which she'll probably win too), then Sam Rockwell who was just brilliant in his character which evolved throughout the movie, then Woody Harrelson too and not to forget to mention Peter Dinklage who for the amount of screen time he gets does a magnificent job with his performance. Another thing that I really appreciated in the movie was the vulgarity. Now hold your horses... I'm not saying that I like a movie more if it has language vulgarity I'm just saying I liked how and when it was used in this film. It wasn't like F-bomb here and there all the time to make the movie more bad-ass because it has vulgarity and not a good story but it was used with finese only when it should have been. I mean persons that had a motive for using it were using it or if the situation (like the trailer shows) needed vulgarity in order to get some things straight (unlike in Logan where it was used just to improve the movie while being never encountered in any Wolverine movie before). The score was also very good... and it was really nice to see a realistic movie having a great score, it really amplifies the overall value of the movie. If I had one problem with the movie, it might be the ending which for me was a little underwhelming but it didn't ruin the overall enjoyment I had with this movie. In conclusion, really great movie with great story, performances and music worthy of all the nominations it got and worthy of many wins also because this movie is along with Dunkirk my favorite movie of 2017. 10/10",10,3,8,3 February 2018
Oblivion," Very good sci-fi flick! (No spoilers)
","I was planning to watch this movie for a long while, actually ever since it came out in 2013. This movie tells the story of Jack Harper who does repairs and cleaning up in a post-apocaliptic world. As he progresses through the movie layers of his story come out and that makes for an interesting movie.This movie was surprisingly received very poorly by the critics when it was released saying that it's the classic case of style over substance. I actually find to have many layers and a lot of character depth. The visuals are stunning and is sad to see that this movie didn't got nominated for an Oscar in 2014 for visuals. They are combined very well sometimes with beautiful landscapes that makes for a fantastic visual experience. But that's not the only thing this movie does right. The characters as the story develops have a lot more layers and depth than you might think at the beginning. The performances are pretty good especially from Tom Cruise who carries this movie forward, but also the rest of the cast do a good job in the screen time they have. The story is really good and at times full of mysterys and intrigue. There is one thing that bothered me and it was the fact that the story tried at times to be to much for the movie or for the pace it had. That meant some less screen time for certain characters that might seem promising or interesting at first. Another thing that I didn't like was that the story overall had some circumstance and motives lacking from some of the situations presented. I was constantly 'it's good, but I would want more'. That would have maybe involved me more into the story and in the movie. Apart from that the story has emotion and humanity at it's core and that is what I liked about it. It was about the characters while using a sci-fi scenario and it was something that you could relate to and have a message sent towards you with which you could remain with by the end of the movie. By the way the ending was beautiful but somewhat short. I mean I would have wanted a bit more explanations and more connections to be tied up by the end. But that didn't ruin the excitement I had overall with the movie. One last thing I'll mention is that the tech seemed very futuristic and realistic for a sci-fi but that is somewhat of an understatement for all the new sci-fi movies nowadays.Overall a very good movie with great visuals, good enough story good performances and fine characters that intrigue as much as entertain the audience. 9/10",9,2,2,11 February 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Seen through the eyes of someone much older...
","Before writing any further I believe a disclamer is in order. I wil not be mentioning any of the good things about this movie (and trust me there are a lot from the music till the acting) mainly because they are all so well known by now and because here on imdb mostly everybody mentions them without saying anything about what I am about to say. In conclusion this movie has a lot of work put in it and it proves, from the masterful cinematography to the music, visual effects, etc... and yes technically it is one of the greatest achievements in cinema history along with the other two Rings movies. But having seen this movie as an adult I can honestly say that the movie, for me at least, has aged not so well I'm afraid.I've seen this movie for the first time as I was little, somewhere around 12-13 years old, and what I remember from then was the awesome 20 minutes intro to the movie and the ending, these two being probably the parts of the movie that impacted me the most back then. Having seen this a second time at 20 years old, for me it lost some of it's magic that it had on me back when I was a kid. Seeing this movie a third time around 25 years old, somewhere arround 2-3 weeks prior to writing this review I was stunned to see how bad in some aspects this movie has aged. I'll try to mention only the ones that bothered me the most.The story: And here there will be much to talk about. Firstly... the viewer is expected to imagine how the ring for one can control all other rings from dwarfs, elves and men then how the ring has such a negative influence around the people wearing it or being anywhere near it, not to metion the fact that the viewer is supposed to imagine how powerfull is the ring, what kind of powers it has. These are huge things that the viewer either has to ignore them or must have a terrific sense of imagination in order to fill in the gaps this movie has with it's story about the ring. Next... the main problem people (who hate Lord of The Rings) have with this universe is that the movies (and particulary this one) are boring. While that is somewhat true, for me is not really the issue that bugs me and downgrades the movie. What I see people have a problem with, is the fact that this movie is basically filler from the moment the fellowship is formed and until it ends by the end of the movie. These two parts by the way are the best parts in the movie for me. So, the problem with the second act or the middle part of the movie is that it is for once redundant and unnecessary. So the idea is that the fellowship goes from point A to point B and during this time they encounter along the way certain dangers that are overcomed but who have no impact on the way they reach point B. So in retrospect, looking back to that, they seem unnecessary. Like what was the point in travelling through that temple and encountering that kraken creature that served no purpose other than create tension and an action scene. So many elements of the middle earth are introduced and characters talk about them as they would know so much about them like some certain mountain of other stuff like that which the viewer has no knowledge about whatsoever. That is really frustrating for me. Imagine The Shawshank Redemption being about how Red and Andy study the prison for 2 of the 2 and 1/2 hours of the film, just so that in the end Andy could escape and all that study was for nothing, just filler. In that movie evreything the characters went through had repercusions and consequences later on the movie. Even the most insignificant thing like Brook writing that he was in that room before killing himself has a resounding importance by the end when Red stumbles in the same room having the same suicide thoughts but overcoming them through the promise he made to Andy and later on writing that he was also there right bellow Brook's message. In this movie however, those events are just passed and never mentioned again. They seem like the writer or the director invented them as he went along so that he could fill the time leading to the sepparation of the fellowship. I could even write more here mentioning Gandalf's death and that creature being pulled out of nowhere just to have Gandalf killed, but it would take just as much as I wrote up until now. But the biggest issue I have with this movie, which cannot be negated nor defended by no one, not even Tolkien himself, is the fact that THE EAGLES COULD HAVE FLOWN FRODO AND SAM TO THE MOUNTAIN HAVE THEM DROP THE RING DESTROY IT AND BE OVER WITH THIS STORY IN A MATTER OF MINUTES! No one and I mean no one can bring a single argument that would be able to defend this ridiculous and contradictory hole in the story which this movie and probably books have. They took Gandalf from like Shire to Isengard and back and they couldn't take Frodo and the fellowship till mount Doom? That is just stupid. Instead they were used two movies later in what is in my opinion the greatest Deus Ex Machina of all time, but I'll say more about that in my Return of The King review. I could go on and talk about some certain visual effects that seemed somewhat fake or about the fact that all these characters are pretty much one-dimensional unlike GoT characters who mostly everyone who's seen at least the first 6 seasons of the show can agree that are way more complex and way more developed than these characters are.Mainly everyone praises this movie as being one of the greatest of alll time, but I am astonished to see how these things fly over people's heads and they love this movie so much even though it has huge problems that just ruin the overall experience for me at times. The other two movies in the trilogy are way better, especially the second which actually has an importance to every single event that happens in the movie and all scenes mean something by the end, or the third movie which has arguably the most epic scenes in cinema of all time.By no means have I wanted to say this movie is bad. No... I enjoy it very much and is a great movie to watch and experience, hence the rating I gave it, but the problems it has cannot be ignored, and I for once will not ignore them, because they really lower down the experience I have with this movie in particular.So to conclude, this movie particulary has not aged well for me, and it is probably similar with Star Wars episode IV which I also find to be very overrated. Strangely both these trilogies have strong sequels which save the movie experience for me, because otherwise the beginnings are somewhat weak.",8,0,2,27 May 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," I really don't get all the hype and praise this movie recieved!(Major spoilers)
","Again, another movie in which I'm on the opposite side of the general opinion about this movie. I really don't care about the countless 10 stared reviews this movie got here because I found huge problems in this and I have arguments, arguments which are coming right below, here's my opinion on this movie:The Story: This movie gets the story from the beginning into a paradox, but is the type of paradox that for me is not as disturbing as the one I'll be telling you along this review. So the first paradox was actually in the previous movie but it has implications in this move as well and is John Connor sending his friend Kyle Reese which later has a baby with Sarah Connor a child named John Connor, which now is in danger because the machines have sent a terminator T-1000 to kill him. So what does John Connor? He sends a terminator that looks like the one who tried to kill Sarah Connor before? Does he not know about that? Of course because he maybe acquired it from the machines. He couldn't construct it from memories because that would be another paradox but one about the circumstance. So he really just sends the same looking terminator just so that we and Sarah Connor might get the thrilling surprise of seeing that terminator again, but now with different motivations. Is like John Connor knew James Cameron was making a movie about his decision and so he thought: 'Hmm... let's make my decision more Hollywodized, why not? Scr*w logic and get on with it!' But that's not the worst part in this movie. The worst part in this movie is that after all the drama, action and conclusion to it... the people in it decide to prevent Judgment Day. Are you seriously? That's even a bigger paradox in this already paradox-crowded movie. It's a continuity paradox which just points out that the director of this movie had no idea how to finish his big action movie. OK, it would be unfair from me to criticize this movie after giving it a 7 rating. So, the things I enjoyed about this movie were the action and the CGI which at that time were as innovating as the ones from Jurassic Park were at the time that movie was released. And to be honest and fair, I liked this movie... but I cannot skip or ignore it's problems... of course you might say it's a subjective view, but isn't how every one of us expresses his opinion. I'm trying to be as objective and also say may opinions which might convince you to agree with me or not, I don't care... everyone is different, it would be stupid to try and please everyone with this review and it would loose its purpose. OK, let's get back to the movie: The human touch is impressive, and that's why I like James Cameron movies. He emphasizes the human part so much that it becomes so believable and inspiring. To make a robot be so memorable and loved by the general audiences tells something about how this guy makes movies.The characters: The characters are bad-ass especially the three main protagonists. But for me T-800 and John's relationship is what gives this movie heart and makes it so memorable and nice to watch. Sarah is OK, probably more bad-ass than in the first movie.The Soundtrack: This is probably the second part of this movie which I didn't like. I thought it wasn't memorable apart for the main theme, yeah... that one with the drums in it. For such an ambitious action movie, the soundtrack in my opinion is underwhelming. There is no iconic track like the scores John Williams made in this same period of time. All that being said, I think this movie is good overall, but very overrated by many people. And seeing so many reviews saying is the best ever or the best in its genre it's pathetic to say the least. So, after saying all of this I'll give this movie a 7 since it gets the action so good, but at the very same time it gets the time travel stuff so awfully wrong in my opinion.Oh... I don't expect to be agreed with by many of the IMDb users, or even promoted by IMDb's reviews system which only promotes very positive reviews for this movie because? Oh, yes I know... it's a classic.",7,2,5,16 March 2017
Aliens," Undeservedly praised!
","I had high expectations coming into this movie mainly due to its high rating and the users' reviews that I saw were praising this movie as the best ever in sci-fi genre. Well... it was and entertaining movie to watch, fun and enjoyable but with some serious issues which I'll be tackling down bellow:1. The science: This movie just like 99% of the all sci-fi movies wants you to believe that artificial gravity can exist in a spacecraft no matter how the spacecraft is or how it moves. Take for instance Interstellar(best sci-fi in my opinion) that tackles this notion and many more to be a complete package that doesn't have the old film school's clichés about gravity in a spacecraft nor the extravagant sound in space where there's no air to conduct the sound waves like it is in this movie. Also releasing a shuttle while orbiting a planet makes the shuttle fall like it's only a couple of miles from the ground.2. Little to no explanation on who are these creatures, what do they want or how are they able to grow in sooo many numbers as depicted in the film so that the soldiers might have something to kill.3. The aliens motives were always changing. For example at the beginning we see one killing the crew of a shuttle in order for the shuttle to not reach Ripley and the soldiers also dying(the alien) in the process, while at the end because it implies Newt(somewhat Ripley's daughter) the Alien kidnaps her and tries to make her a host for a new xenomorph. What's the logic here? Do they have intellect in order to assume which people is worthy of dying and who is worthy of being a host? The movie never tackles that and since I don't understand their motives I'm gonna call it a sin(see Cinema sins). 4. There isn't a Alien movie without a robot/droid dying. Here somehow the alien queen or whatever that alien creature was ties itself to the shuttle Bishop was flying at the end although we clearly don't see any sign of it on the shuttle(and yes there's a clear shot of the shuttle in full flight in which the craft looks clean, no alien tied up) but surely we don't want to show it to the audience to ruin the surprise from later on when the queen breaks Bishop in half.5. In the end just to create more tension in the film we see this: Ripley opens the outside door from that pit she, her mechanical costume and the alien have fallen into, but then after the alien falls into the outside void why in God's name doesn't she closes the outside door with the same switch she used to open the door and to which she was next to on those stairs. Instead she has to climb all the way up to the platform on which the shuttle landed and close the outside door with a switch that's next to the inside door. The movie never tackled that thing on why she couldn't close the outside door with the switch she initially used to open it and why she had to climb all the way to the platform and close it from there. I just started laughing when I saw this much stupidity, but of course that's what a James Cameron movie has sometimes(see T2: Judgment Day).I could go on and on about the positives but most of them have been already written on so many favorable reviews this movie got, so to sum this up: This is a fun movie with excellent action, great characters, good music and awesome special effects. But for me that isn't enough if your story is filled with drag moments only there to fill the runtime or create unnecessary new twists and turns or suspense. It's an 8 from me for this entertaining but flawed movie.",8,1,2,18 November 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Are movie standards so low, that a movie like this one is considered to be a masterpiece?(minimal spoilers)
","You might wonder at first why I rate this movie with 1. Read the whole review and then later you'll find out why. So, without further due let me tell you my opinion about this movie.The bad: I found very convenient that the main idea of the Avengers having to answer for their casualties right in this movie where the main theme is civil war or a war between friends as we see later in the movie. And it's very dull in my opinion that this idea is only exploited right now, and it's sole purpose is to serve the plot and make you believe the plot. But here's the problem: why wasn't this idea exploited in the previous movies, and why are the Avengers only now regret failing to save people(as you'll see in a scene at the beginning of this movie) but never shown any signs of remorse after failing to save thousands of people in Sarkovia? I'll tell ya, they were to busy saying one-liners. Again it's so predictable and dull, that only movies like Taken 2 or Transformers might have it. Next there are minor mistakes like a scene where a man is drown and as he hangs upside down his head is introduced into a vessel of water clearly his nose is above the water level, but then as he is left do drown, his body doesn't drop yet his nose is somehow under water just so he could, die(maybe cinema sins or ScreenRant might help here). Next, when Spider-man does an Empire Strikes back move on a giant ant-man, his web seems to never end although he circles him countless times, and so on, I could try to remember as many flaws like this ones, but that's not my point. What I'm trying to say is that this movie is more predictable than Batman v Superman was, but that movie had some twists and moments that I never expected and gave the feeling of watching a comic book movie, while this movie is more about a real life situation that would imply superheroes, but that's not a very accurate comic book adaptation but is rather a 'what if there were superheroes in real life' situation, and quite honestly I don't know which side people are on... but whatever, moving on... The humor again was sometimes very badly placed in scenes where there was fighting to the death, I mean come on, as a real person in a real life situation(as this movie suggests) you wouldn't make jokes, would you? And last but not least, the 100+ nations gather way too easily. If it was a real world, things wouldn't be that simple. The good: Oh, yeah, you knew this was coming... Spider-man for me was like Batman in BvS, extremely well adapted from the comics. It took the best out of the two previous incarnations. It took the genius and nerd attitude from Tobey's Peter Parker while being funny and very talkative like Andrew Garfield's Spider-man was. I absolutely loved it and he made the movie worth seeing after all(can't wait for his solo movie). The action and the way movie was proceeding was good, as fast as BvS might say, but clearly the plot was made on the way, and the conflict wasn't very well developed, while neither BvS did a better job but in that case the plot started from things we already knew from Man of Steel while this one introduces new things and memories just to serve this movie's plot, while being no other clue of them appearing in other Marvel movies before this one. The fights were beyond awesome, very realistic and very real life street fight made like, unlike BvS where the fight scenes were more comic book style, but should either of these two different styles bother you? It's up to you to decide. The humor even though at times was badly placed, sometimes was very well placed in scenes that needed humor to make them memorable(and of course many of these were made by Spidey) At times it was very sentimental and very emotional, but I don't understand how critics see only these things and don't see the bad ones I wrote above. I hope some of you will agree with me, but remember this is a subjective opinion, although I tried to be as objective as I could.So, to wrap up this review, I'll say this: This movie is a strong addition to the Marvel universe, and typical for their style of movie making. I enjoyed it, even though I was offended to see that the critics are praising this movie so much, and reviewing BvS so badly, which in my opinion is not objective(since this is the role of critics, to objectively review a movie). So this is why I vote 1 for this movie, because it's rating here is hugely overrated, and IMDb seems to be on the side of critics(but I'll not enter in the way they calculate the rating).This movie's real rating should be around 7-8, probably the same like Age of Ultron, but until it gets there(which probably won't happen), I rate this movie with 1.So saying that this movie is a masterpiece is like saying Taken 2 is a good movie. Maybe this movie is a masterpiece, but only compared to a movie like Batman vs Robin, although there are movies like the Dark Knight trilogy and Watchmen, OR Iron-Man(since we're talking about Marvel here) that are comic book movies masterpieces. OK, I'm done now :)",1,123,251,10 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A very charming and entertaining movie! (no spoilers)
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a movie starring Eddie Radmayne and it's apparently a Harry Potter prequel, although I did not see those movies. This movie tells the story of Newt a wizard who carries a suitcase full of fantastic beasts and from there all sorts of complicated things can happen and so we have a movie.I'll start by saying that for a guy who never seen a Harry Potter movie this movie made me wanna directly watch all those movies. It balances so well magic and real life story with some great set pieces that feel like you are in the 19th century or whenever this movie is set. It was a very entertaining movie with a fantastic performance by Eddie Redmayne. I don't know why this guy reminds me of Matt Smith and his 11th doctor from Doctor Who. Eddie's performance is very good in this movie and in my opinion very underrated. The other performances were also good and really gave the characters enough humanity to make them believable. The score was also excellent, once again James Newton Howard proves his a master with movie music. He scores an extremely versatile music score with comedic and dramatic music blending in so well. The story is somewhat rushed and underwhelming, although I got the overall main plot but certain sub-plots were very weird and not emphasized enough to absorb me into the story. The visuals were great although no match for The Jungle Book. If I was to have some issues i'd be that the movie is not so emotional moving when it tries to be or that some scenes and characters felt weird along with their motivations but overall I got the point of what the movies was about with them. Overall a good movie with good performances and very good music, excellent set pieces especially the costumes (which won an oscar btw), but somewhat of a underwhelming story and some weird scenes and characters. 8/10",8,0,0,9 February 2018
Inside Out," I really wanted this to be a masterpiece!
","Let me start by saying that I've seen many bad reviews for this film and some good ones trying to combat those bad ones. I tried to keep an open mind and not let myself influenced by any of them and make my own opinion. So here it is:First of this movie starts strong and I got me from the first second although I mainly knew what it was about.The concept was very interesting executed although it was way too oversimplified, but hey... it's a kid's movie, would talk about how feelings develop or manifest in science terms? You must make these ideas interesting, captivating and palpable for children and props to the movie for doing that. But after that the movie lost it's tempo for me unfortunately. It got actually unnecessary complicated. It was like this scene here, this scene there could be pulled out of the movie, and the movie wouldn't have suffered for it. I'll enter some spoilers territory here so for those who haven't seen the movie skip this part. ***SPOILERS: When Joy finds herself with sadness along the crest of that cliff and sees that she needs to get back, she realizes that she can't go along the edge of it because there wasn't enough space. But later on when the clock was ticking suddenly there was space between the long-term memories and the edge of the cliff just so that joy could reach the place she wanted to go. That is just lazy writing and some inconsistency. Next, at the beginning of her journey back to the tower joy sees the islands crashing very fast, but later on when the movie is ending and she\s running out of time, the last island (which was family island and a bigger one though) it crashes so slowly that again screams laziness in writing a cohesive story that is constant from start to finish and doesn't contradicts itself on the way. Next when joy tries to reach the train she makes and unnecessary detour with Bing bong that is just there to offer some character development to a character that I didn't need investing in. By the end Bing bong starts to disappear like one hand in 10 or 15 minutes of screen time but at the end when he sacrifices himself to help joy get back on the cliff he instantly disappears in an instant, again inconsistency... END OF SPOILERS***Apart from that the story was beautiful with some very touching moments that almost made me cry and very mature (but not too mature as some people said here) themes for both children and adults alike. The humor... some of the best humor in a animated movie ever put to screen, and that surely elevated this movie in my opinion. The score was again extremely well don by Michael Giacchino, although not one of his best or better ones.All in all a good movie with some great moments in it but at the same time with severe incoherence problems that unfortunately for me didn't work as a masterpiece (like it was praised by critics) like for example 'Coco' or 'Zootopia' or 'Wall-E'. 8/10",8,2,6,28 December 2018
Toy Story 4," Everything wrong with Pixar
","I got the chance to see this movie along with a couple of my friends and although they've enjoyed a little (and I can totally understand why someone would enjoy such a movie) i just didn't.From the first minutes I had my doubts that this movie is going to be any good... and here is why: Boring plot. Nothing interesting happens, things just happen and there's a time jump and then more things happen and the plot just gets more and more complicated. Having a plot that gets more complicated just as a pretext or excuse for a lack of an interesting story is a lame way to try to write a good story. Which brings me to the second point of this review. And namely that there are way to many unnecessary complications. Everything just complicates and complicates and it becomes really hard to follow the plot and unerstand what's the point of this movie and what message it's trying to transmit. Everything is convoluted and that is not how you write a good story. On the contrary the story must be simple enough to be followed but at the same time complex enough to be interesting and captivate the audience. This movie had none of the above. That was accomplished mainly through dumb decissions from almost all of the characters. Many of the characters made no sense in the universe they were a part of and just making weird decisions in order to move the plot forward is not an excuse or a trait of good characters or good story. Most of the new characters were anyway very annoying and uninteresting with the exception of 3 new characters 2 brothers and a doll whose stories and conclusions were one of the better parts of the movie. Aside from that there was an obvious political agenda making Bo Peep such a strong character and making Woody look like an incompetent or idiot most of the times. Typicall feminism propaganda.The only good parts were as I mentioned before the 3 new characters and their stories. The ending was a bit more like old style Toy Story action and suspence, but the road until there was very rough and bumpy. Very boring story with uninteresting and boring and at times annoying new characters but a gourgeous animation. However, a good animation is not what makes a good movie, right? 5/10",5,1,1,1 March 2020
Before Sunset," An enjoyable movie without any purpose
","That's how I would describe the first movie too: as a very enjoyable and sweet movie that ultimately had no goal, no purpose. It just ends and it leaves without any sense of catharsis. After watching the first movie I felt I didn't have to watch it in the first place.Now having watched the sequel and hoping this would bring something to the trilogy, I can honestly say that this is part 2 of 'The movie without purpose'.Usually great movies have a plot that by the end pays off in a way or another (either good like The Dark Knight either bad like The Last Jedi), but they all pay off. That's part of why people watch them and other movies. Because by the end the movie has somewhat of a finality that makes you look back on the movie and say 'it was worth it to watch this movie'. Here on the other hand, there is no finality, there is no ultimate purpose of the movie with the characters or with the story. I never felt relieved or inspired or with a sense of catharsis when I watched either of the two movies (Before Sunrise and Before Sunset). Sure it's enjoyable and lovely to see these two guys walk around a street talking about different things from life and making you question how do you relate to those things, but ultimately this movie has no deep meaning or a main theme runing throughout the movie so that by the end you could feel moved or inspired or feel that movie was worth it.I don't understand who would consider this movie a masterpiece or the best movie of the year since there are way more movies that have also a realistic feel to them but above all have purpose and a message. This one does not!",8,0,0,18 July 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning has begun! (Spoiler free review)
",I went in to this movie not knowing anything about its plot or story. I only knew it was about the adventures of some hero from a Budapest Hotel. Honestly I didn't think this movie was going to be any good since its plot wasn't that much interesting but I though I'd give it a try since it was the only movie from the 2015 Oscars highlights I didn't saw. Now I can say that I was not wrong because this movie succeeds as a comedy with some absurd scenes that had me laughing very hard and with characters that are really well done. Aside from that this movie in my opinion had some issues. Mainly the story is very weird told and I was bored for most of the movie although I understood the main thing of the movie and this whole adventure Gustavo and Zero had. The movie never emphasised the characters who were important to the story... I get the movie had to be absurdly funny but you need to catch the viewer's attention with a plot that can be followed and interesting and characters that are introduced properly. I was continuously asking myself who's this? who's that? because the movie's story went on like I was supposed to know who those characters were. But putting that aside there were things I liked like the absurd humor that sometimes had me laughing very hard and the way the movie was constructed. It's been told like a multi-layered story that goes from present to the past with 4 levels of story which made it really interesting in that perspective. Apart from that there were some extremely well done scenes and the movie as a whole was very colorful with some of the best cinematography (I honestly would have given the oscar for cinematography to this movie not to Birdman) although I literally can't understand how Interstellar was not nominated that year. Overall a funny movie with some interesting characters and a multi-layered story and absurd humor. 8/10,8,3,5,2 February 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Still to this day one of the greatest achievements in cinema history!
","Before saying anything about this masterpiece, I will say that this is my favorite Lord of The Rings movie by far. While the first is an adventure that is just basically filler from the moment the Fellowship is formed and until it is broken and the third one is basically Deus Ex Machina after Deus Ex Machina, this one is the perfect balance between storytelling and epicness on a biblical level.Ever since I watched the trilogy as I was a little boy 12 or 13 years old, this was the movie that made me fall in love with middle earth. I still remember the excitement I had as I watched this movie the first time and how amazed I was seeing all the pieces of the movie's story come together in what is one of the best third acts of any movie I've ever seen. So why is this movie for me the best one of the trilogy?<ul><li>Unlike the first one, where after the Fellowship is formed they basically just pass one obstacle after another with no connection whatsoever between them (not to say that it introduces so much lore and stuff that probably only book fans would know like the ancient creature by the end which serves absolutely no purpose to the story other than killing Gandalf), this movie takes the pieces left by the first movie and just develops such an interesting story with each of the characters. Merry and Pipin have their adventure discovering Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas go to Rohan and prepare for the ineviatable battle which will come upon Helm's Deep, while Frodo and Sam continue their Journey encoutering Smeagol and trying to make him lead them through the mountains towards mount Doom. And that is probably the best part of the movie: the urgency of the situation. The impending doom that's coming from Isengard upon the realm of men and how can they stop this. Every story goes at the beginning it's own separate way just so that by the end they all come full circle and connect with each other for a masterfull ending.</li></ul><ul><li>Unlike the third movie this movie doesn't rest on Deus Ex Machina to resolve it's conflicts but rather develops each story in it's own way and lets you think they have nothing to do with each other, only to have them come together by the end in an epic finale. For example: Gandalf's intervention by the end is well developed and is NOT a Deus Ex Machina since he went to get help and by the end of the movie he brings indeed help. Merry and Pipin's story seamingly unimportant at the beginning of the movie it does play and enormous role by the end of this movie and also in the beginning of the next, by having the threes intervene and destroy Isengard.</li></ul>All the other things about cinematography or visual effects not to mention the music (which is spectacular) make this movie a fantastic fantasy movie and an example on how to adapt a fantasy source material to the big screen. This is and will remain for me the best Lord Of The Rings movie and one of the best acomplishments in cinema history. A shame this movie wasn't nominated for many oscars like the other two did, since it is at least as good as teh other two if not better.",10,0,1,25 May 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," Another well adapted comic book movie, another misinterpretation from critics(minimal spoilers)
","Just like BvS this year the critics don't know how a comic book adapted movie should be done. Here's my honest opinion about this movie: The good: I start with the good, because the bad parts are not so many as the good ones. So, the movie starts with an Apocalypse prologue and it's that powerful and full of tension like Bane's in the Dark Knight Rises, also the music is fantastic, watched the film in IMAX 3D and the sound was awesome by the way. There are another memorable scenes in the movie but I'll try not gonna disclose anything that happens in the movie. The pacing is really fast, and at times it might seem like a stupid movie or a mess of a movie, but it's not, and if you leave any expectations behind you'll enjoy the way this movie is made. Another great thing about it is that it introduces most of the 'new' X-Men, and I say 'new' cause Cyclops and Jean are well known. I really liked the way they introduced Cyclops, and you can actually see his struggle with his powers and maybe feel a little of what he was feeling. The battle scenes are cool, very simple yet very good. And yes indeed Quicksilver is again awesome, if you thought that his scene from DOFP was awesome, you need to see this one, absolutely brilliant! And the thing I realised I liked after the movie is that is very well adapted from the comics. It's literally a guy who's trying to lead the mutants into a new world, and the X-men must stop him. Oh, and I like to point the fact that unlike Marvel's new additions, this movie actually has a good humor, not exaggerated or misplaced, but very well added and executed(especially Quicksilver). And last but not least, the powers of the superheroes were showed brilliantly, especially Cyclops's and Jean's. The bad: Even though there might not be to much to say about the movie that is bad, I'll say what I've noticed. The main problem is that this movie is not profound. I mean you don't really feel the motivation of Apocalypse, because for a mutant of 'God' sizes you would expect(or I at least expected) to have like a real profound reason for what he's doing. Apart from that there is nothing too memorable from him except his manipulations, there aren't any quotes either from him or the other actors, which is unfortunate, cause sometimes in comics we have moments like this. Next the way Apocalypse rises again is very weird, I mean he literally stays buried for 3000 years, but is not explained either how he survived or what was that caused his rise in the present, and this might seem to some of the people watching the movie very convenient, but honestly I didn't have that much of a problem with that, I mean it's a comic book movie.OK, and in the end let me tell you why critics don't like this movie or any movie too much adapted from comics. Haven't you noticed that critics like comic book movies to be filled with political things or social things, controversies, that's why they liked Avengers or Civil War, and especially X-Men 1 and 2, First Class, Days of Future Past. The critics like the comic book movies to feel like this actually might happen, or to feel real, which is not the case. And that's why every time comic book movies adapt very well the source material, and do not introduce politics or social things in their movies critics say it's c**p(see BvS early this year).So with that being said, this is my personal opinion, a subjective one, even though I tried to be objective, it's my opinion, you might like it, you might not, but this is how I think the movie was. I rate this with 8, cause it's a very fine addition to the X-Men franchise, and I like this franchise to go on especially with this new young cast they have.",8,5,10,29 May 2016
Back to the Future Part III," Better than the second, worst than the first.
","Firstly, it's a good enough ending to a 'could have been much more' trilogy.The acting just like in the second was horrible. I mean, it was obviously that the actors were pretending not acting like they should have.The story was good, fun and interesting and on top of all that, necessary to save the doctor. Again the same problem with the actors. There was Sheamus McFly and his wife who were looking exactly like Marty and his mom but they had different hairstyles and clothes which made it more realistically.The love story was good, although it didn't suited to the doctor, just like fainting didn't suited him.Just like in the first movie I felt the suspense at the end, not knowing if the doctor will actually made it back to the 1985 or remain in 1885.The final scene with the doctor telling Marty that the future is what you make it to be, just made the second movie useless, and here I guess you know why.Overall, good movie, not as good as the first but way more better than the second for which I give it a 7/10 :)",7,0,0,8 September 2013
Coco," El mejor from Pixar! (No spoilers)
","Coco is a new animated movie created by Lee Unkrich and tells the story of Miguel and how he wants to become a great musician just like his great-great-grandfather. This movie was on the Oscar buzz list ever since it got released so I gave it a try since I loved the Toy Story trilogy and Finding Nemo which were also created by Unkrich if I'm not mistaken.Let me start by saying that I was starting to believe that in nowadays cinema there wasn't any more 'inspiration' or creativity until I saw this movie. I'll admit it's like most of the animated pixar movies regarding the narative structure but the originality of the story cannot be neglected. This is probably the best movie of 2017 and even if it had only 105 minutes it felt like a three hour epic. That was because this movie was so rich and so many things happen that it hits you and stays with you long after it's over. This is probably the most mature movie I've seen from pixar ever. The story is very original and the set pieces are so authentic and it gives you the Mexican atmosphere so naturally and makes you basically teleport into this universe. And although I've said it above that this movie follows the same narative structure as most of pixar movies, it has a original story to tell and one that is mature, one that is full of message and ideas. For example the idea that everyone dies sometimes and all of us sooner or later will be forgotten or how important is to love your family and treasure those you have for the time you have them with you. I have an old grandma and while I was watching the end I had such a warm feeling of wanting to hug her and tell her I love her and that I'll miss her when she's gone but I always remember her. This is what a great movie does to the audience: it inspires them, it reminds them of things that we sometime bury due to our hurry in this life. I just can't find any superlatives for this movie. The voice acting is fantastic and the most impressive thing is that all the cast was spanish talking persons which had such an authentic feel in the overall movie. Then there's the score which is fantastic. I cannot understand how it didn't get nominated for Oscar since it replicates the traditional mexican style of music while also being a beautifull movie score. Props to Michael Giacchino who is one of my favorite composers alive. It's beyond me how this didn't get nominated for original score but the generic iconic music of star wars the last jedi by John Williams did. My only gripes with the movie might be that it somewhat slows down in the middle and some creature were kind of a unanswered mystery for me. Aside from that this movie is pretty much flawless and is one of my best movie experiences ever.In conclusion: fantastic movie with great story, amazing voice acting from a well chosen cast, great score and songs and superb animation. 10/10",10,2,4,7 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Wasted oportunity!(1st part spoiler free, 2nd part with spoilers)
","***SPOILER FREE PART HERE***
Where do I begin? I went to the theater having read all the spoiler free reviews this movie got starting from it's release date. So my expectations were at prequel-levels of low if you know what I mean. I knew there was going to be some controversy in the movie but I was like:'Hey... if they have a backstory or motivation strong enough for me to believe, I'll maybe like it.' But oh boy I was in for a nightmare. The film started with illogical space scenes, then went to stupid story lines that took the characters from point A to point B to get something from point B only so that in the end all the effort didn't matter. There was little to no background for Luke's way of acting in this movie, I mean he had no strong motivation, which was a problem that I saw the movie had from the beginning to the end which crippled it. Characters were changing motivations like weather and talking drastic decisions just for the sake of taking them without any ramifications or logic towards the future of the franchise. And let me expand this: The movie felt like it was made by 2 types of directors: one that build great climaxes towards huge twists and another one(like 5 years old or something) that would write idiotic conclusion the the twist that let me like: 'what?' 'how is that possible?' and no explanation further. Basically it felt as if Ryan Johnson build those moments for huge twists and then just slapped the audience in the face with incredibly dumb resolutions. Everything was awfully wrong and felt like a 'Batman and Robin' disaster. To conclude this: all those awesome game-changing moments from the trailer are just lies meant to drag the audience towards something but actually scr*wing them up after.***SPOILER PART COMING BELLOW!***
Ok, so word limit... gotta be quick. From the start the movie goes illogical with that First Order fighter that after is being shot by an X-wing SOMEHOW goes through 6 bomb carriers and destroys them all like they were air, like they wouldn't at least slow him down one at a time, why? I'll tell you, to dramatize the poor situation the resistance was in... and make you enthusiastic for the Resistance that later on when BOMBS FELL FROM BOMB CARRIER IN SPACE(=VOID) TO THAT FIRST ORDER BIG-DESTROYER, ends in a prequelish style the conflict. The movie then shifts to the Rey-Luke story which I found to be the most interesting in the whole movie. She goes to him, hands him the lightsaber and Luke after seeing it, you would think he would wonder how it got to Rey and now to him right? No, comic-relief incoming... throws it over his back. This scene didn't said much at the beginning for me but after seeing the movie I realized that it summarized the whole movie perfectly: A movie that build up greatly towards a game-changing revelation or twist and then slapped you in the face by resolving that twist or revelation so cheap and so immature that I was wondering how in the world could a mature man come up with a story like this. It looked like it was written by a 5-year old at best. Then after some verbal exchanges between them Luke starts to teach Rey 3 lessons in the Force. In one of them he puts Rey to feel the force and she goes instead to the only dark forced place in the island and Luke is like 'you went so easily there'. At that point I was like 'ok, that would be interesting to maybe turn Rey to the Dark Side and bring back Kylo from it.' That would have been a fantastic story arc. What did the movie do instead? Never mentioned it again. Actually when she is faced with Snoke she is so determined to not be turned to the dark side that just contradicted everything they build on her character in the movie up until then. Let's talk about Kylo: This movie at the beginning builds his character towards accepting more of the Light Side of the force by deciding to not kill his mother(although at how his character eventually becomes it would have been a great build up in Dark Side inside him with that move) and KILLING FREAKING SNOKE. At that point I was like 'ok, again another promising build-up towards him turning to the light-side.'. However the movie after that instantly turns him super-evil just for the sake of having a villain in the movie. Forgot to mention, at on point the movie starts to develop a certain relationship between Rey and Kylo using force-connections in which they talk to another. I tought that could have been an interesting plot change, to make them join forces or maybe become attracted to one another and maybe defeat Snoke together. No, they depart ways because Kylo suddenly wants to kill everyone that tied him to the past and 'bring order to the galaxy'(Vader style). So from all the possibilities the movie could have gone with this, they chose the most typical and foolish. Ok, going back to Luke, his motivations are incredibly changing throughout the movie and have no background for why they are as they are. So, he trained young Jedi(Ben Solo among them) to discover that Ben had a darkness growing in him because of Snoke? I mean how? The movie doesn't show that and it's as vague about it as was TFA. Suddenly Luke wants to kill Ben. Didn't he think like 'it's my sister's son. Shouldn't I talk to her before murdering her child?'. No, but just decided that because the screenwriter wanted it, otherwise there would not be any explanation. And when you can't explain a character's motivation in a movie without saying that it was the screenwriter's will, then you know he(screenwriter) failed. Here is a piece of dialogue that I thought for Luke to explain his motivations and it would make for a better story for him than the one we got in the movie: 'I tried training new Jedi, but when I saw the darkness growing in Ben I had to do something. If Obi-Wan who trained my father failed at keeping him to the light side, what change could I had with keeping Ben to the light? If Obi-Wan failed, I was going to fail as well, or at least that's what I was convinced at that point. So I had to do something in order to keep the galaxy safe from the rising of another future Sith Lord'. That would have given a little sense to his actions and maybe make him realize that what he tried at that point was wrong. Going back to Leia's supposedly death scene. The control room from the front of the resistance ship where she was standing was destroyed by First Order fighters. We literally see her die and float in space just a while so that out of nowhere in this entire saga, where she didn't care about the force, she comes back to life(using the force apparently) and goes inside the ship near a door and enters the ship to later be put into a coma and come back to health by the end of the movie. I was wondering did the producers knew the actress died right? They also made Kylo's character the new supreme leader and impossible to turn(not even by Leia) to the light-side again, so why there was a reason to keep her alive and not kill her and give her the sent off she deserved? Finn and Rose's story line was interesting but ultimately wasted oportunity. They go to find a master cracker that would get them on Snoke's ship and deactivate the tracker with which the First Order followed the Resistance's cruiser in hyperspace, although the movie never explains how they were tracking the Resistance. They find a cracker other than the one who they were searching for and this one waited for them in a prison. At first I was like 'how convenient that he unlocked the prison door and had the key just when Rose and Finn came' but later it's revealed that he was actually a 'Lando 2.0' and that leads to a stupid and short fight or round 2 of Finn vs Phasma. In the end the Resistance finds shelter on a planet and take cover behind a huge door. The First Order comes there and besieges that stronghold. Somehow convinced by ghost of Yoda, Luke comes back but just like a ghost to face Kylo, although him for real would have been a better and more unpredictable scene. After Luke's ghost is discovered he dies on the island and becomes one with the Force because why? Did he actually fought Kylo or was in danger of dying like Obi-Wan was in episode IV? After that somehow Rey comes with the Falcon and helps Finn, Poe and the Resistance to escape from that stronghold by lifting some HUGE AND IMMENSE rocks that she clearly didn't have the training to do so since all she did was argue with Luke and take 3 lessons with him(Luke trained with Obi Wan then with Yoda and was still not prepared enough to face Vader). The final nail in the coffin for this movie was Finn's scene at the end where he goes for that cannon. I was happy to let him die because he was a character that has been build over the course of two movies and a sacrifice like that would have been a fitting end for his story-arc and an ACTUAL SHOCKING TWISTING MOMENT IN THE MOVIE! No! Rose had to save him in the last moment clichÃ©.Aside from that the visuals were top-notch, but what are visuals good at if you don't have a logical story and clever twists? The score: oh boy... such a disappointment. I downloaded it on thursday and listen to it. At first I was: blah... generic iconic music. I said let's try and listen it again, maybe I missed something musical or iconic or thematic... no, it didn't get any better. And that's the problem with John Williams lately: no inspiration whatsoever. He used to write iconic scores that had multiple themes and motifs in them. Now he is composing just generic iconic music like Danny Elfman. Aside from that the acting is pretty good but ultimately wasted with a awful story.I didn't think that there could be a worse movie than TFA. I was wrong and this movie makes TFA look like a masterpiece. That's how bad this joke for a movie is. Officially it has become the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and by far the worst movie from the Star Wars Saga. 1/10",1,33,54,18 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," I don't think this movie can be spoiled(Minor Spoilers)
","Where do I even begin with this movie? From the fact that the characters don't have 1% background for the motives they have in this film... to the stupid humor that feels so unnecessary in sooo many scenes that ruins the tone of the movie and makes you question yourself was this supposed to be a comedy or a serious movie? OK, let's get on with the review:The Characters: There's literally 1 scene to introduce the character of Star Lord, and it's supposed to make us care for him since some of his close people dies... it doesn't give context to his story as to why we should feel for him. But the movie quickly goes to action, space then more action then humor then even more action then even more humor... and that's basically it! The rest of the characters are literally there to fill the character queue and have ourselves a team in the process. The closest Marvel movie that can relate to this is Fantastic Four(the 2005 one) where the characters shared a connection that made their process of becoming a team so much believable, while here they are introduced to us with no context whatsoever to the actual story or with no hint of connection between them and to put it more simply no context to their story, they just pop out in the beginning as the movie progresses. Their background story is literally a couple of one- liners, that's it! Fantastic Four at least developed as best as it could the characters it had before pitting them in the superhero war... and yes the movie is bad, but is bad due to poor filmmaking but this movie is even worse than that one not due to poor filmmaking but to the poor story and stupid humor which nowadays seems to make up for idiotic story in the eyes of some people. Next, the villain. Where do I pick this guy... he's the most predictable and boring villain ever(ties with the one from Ant-Man and more recently Steppenwolf from JL). There's literally 0 motivation for why he's doing what he's doing. It's like he turns against his master and decides to try and destroy a planet because this movie needs a villain and that's it(sure, some people will say that he was in conflict with the people from that planet, but the movie doesn't show that so I don't believe it), buy that, digest that and be happy with that. In the older Marvel movies like Spider-man trilogy, the bad guy had a motivation for what he was doing being either revenge or to prove himself. Here... 0 motivation.Next the story: So immature from the stupid humor that made characters so unbelievable to the crazy and idiotic situations like dancing in front of the bad guy just to distract him? Come one there are thousand of different ways to distract a person... but the movie just keeps going with the stupidity of exaggerated humor to abominable limits.The action: This probably the only part where the movie succeeded. The CGI was good and the fight scenes well choreographed but they hit something of a block due to the stupid humor that almost ruins every last one of them. Oh, but let's not forget that after you build the impenetrability of Ronan's scepter along the whole movie... in the end a small rocket destroys it and releases the infinity stone which is caught by Star Lord and somehow it doesn't kill him(you can say that the team helped him absorb the energy of the stone but the movie doesn't explain that so I don't buy it) because it's later revealed that his father was some sort of freaking alien that could resist to the power of the infinity stone. How convenient right? The movie only reveals it now without any tease among the whole 2 hours of the film which makes me believe that it was made up on the way type of garbage.I could go on and write tons of other arguments related to the bad acting and stupid scenes that ruin the eventual character development this movie might have - if it had one - but I'll stop here because I said the most important things that bothered me. Old Marvel movies used to spend time with their characters while here is just another set up for MCU future films that in my opinion fails miserably and makes for a joke of a movie. The huge rating of this tr6sh shows how easily people are fooled to digest stupidity and the worst part of it all is that lately this is how Marvel and some other type of movies are made like... So my rating will be 1 for this piece of tr6sh that deserves to be shown on Cartoon Network in order to make kids laugh harder, not in cinema or on another TV non-cartoon network.Oh, there's gonna be a vol. 2 of this cr6p, so for those seeking a mature story driven movie, avoid it at all costs!",1,5,12,10 March 2017
The Imitation Game," Another hollywoodized biography movie...
","It's becoming annoying that movies nowadays are based so much on the artistic part rather than delivering a message and telling a compelling story to the audiences so that after you watch the movie you'll say 'it was worth it!'. This movie is no exception from what I wrote above, here's why:The Science: In a movie about the invention of the first computer, you have to be scientifically authentic and I mean to use scientific terms or at least try to explain to the audiences what the hell is Enigma? In this movie Enigma is as enigmatic as the tesseract in MCU... The only moment when there's actually a hint of science is the scene between Alan and Joan where Alan tries to explain enigma to her but that scene makes Alan look like an idiot.. I mean a guy who knows so much about decrypting codes should sound like a guy trying to speak on understandable terms even though he might struggle with that due to the fact that he knows so many scientific things... Benedict tries so hard and I appreciate his effort but the writers are to blame here for a lame and hollywoodized script.The story. I don't know the actual historical facts but the way the characters are presented to us make them unbearable and way too clichéd. I couldn't care less for Alan who's story was just used only to gave the actor playing him a great performance in order to win the Oscar. The scene at the end where he is shown to have hormonal problems is supposed to make us care for him? Why didn't they developed that early in the movie so that his character had a reason for being this way. Remember when biography movies told us from the beginning that the main character had a problem that made us care for him and even start the plot (see King's Speech) , while here the protagonist's problem is thrown in the movie at the end like 'Hey! Here's Alan's problem and you should care for him!' disgusting... There are tons of examples of great performances within movies that have great story and make you care for the characters and for what happens in the story. Take for example Colin Firth's performance in the King's Speech. That movie actually had a compelling story that made you care for the main character's problem, while here is just a display of Benedict's and Kera's acting. This movie's story has so many clichés, even more than Spider-man 3 I should say and here are some examples: A girl is ridiculously smart and finishes the test so fast it just points to her BING! There's the hot smart girl in this movie. The only way to make her more clichéd I guess was to write a note on her forehead saying 'This is the hot and clever chick in this movie and she'll have a relationship with the main protagonist!' Anyway moving on... Alan is being bullied like a high school kid for being to clever, this is worse than Tobey's Peter in Spider-man(at least that movie had a compelling story and a fantastic heart to it)... I could go on like this but there's a word limit.The music: Bland and typical Alexandre Dumas... although his score for Godzilla was way more epic and inspiring than this garbage which by the way gets nominated for Oscar, while the other score doesn't even gets nominated for an Oscar. Surprise? Just another soundtrack made to please the Oscars. There are tons of great soundtracks that didn't get nominated for Oscar and are way better than this sh*t. This just shows that not everything that is nominated for Oscars means is the best there is out there. This movie is again, no exception.To sum up my review: This is a typically Hollywood 'trying to impress and win Oscars' movie that has no heart and no clever or intriguing plot. I rated this movie with 1, since it can't be compared with biography masterpieces like The King's Speech for example or Rush. This movie's real rating should be around 6-7 probably more towards 7, but with IMDb's rating system and with all the so called 'critics' here, this movie's rating inflated to 8.1, which is even higher than The King's Speech.",1,3,5,23 January 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," This is what happens when you don't use art to inspire and question the audience, or do you? (Probably some spoilers)
","But actually this movie just shows some images that might put you on thought about the deep message of the movie. And come to think about that this movie is so praised for being mind-blowing and visually stunning(agree only with the last one). So to quote a reviewer who once said this line: 'Great movies are often those who question the audience'. So what's wrong with this movie? The simple fact that it gives the audiences the answer as if the answer would be that or the other one, not one which we would realize we could not comprehend or realize it exceeds our grasp of understanding the things in our 3 dimensional space. But the question and the complexity of the movie is either missing or hidden so well in order for the ending to shock the viewer. For me personally - because this is a subjective review - I would prefer for the movie to take me somewhere where I would understand that I can't understand... like have a message beyond words or images. Instead this movie spends it's time with nonsensical stuff and doesn't asks me or takes me to that place I might not fully grasp or comprehend but rather shows images of things whose meaning I couldn't understand in the context of the movie.Next point I'll touch with this review is that all the persons and their supposed knowledge or expertise seemed so fake and cheaply executed. This is mainly because the movie tries to force one idea on my throat by repeating it over and over with different characters and set pieces that just ruins the humanity of the characters or their professional authenticity. So, to give you an example take the hibernating process which in my opinion seemed fake just like the artificial gravity... it was like a theater play. Not even a word about how it was done that might show me as a spectator that the guys were astronauts who knew what they were doing and what physical concepts or theories were using. Instead there were more ambiguous and vague images that might capture my attention or curiosity. And then when movies like 'Interstellar' come with actors guided by astronauts on how to float in 0 G, or theories of physics that prove that the characters do know those stuff, majority of the so-called 'critics' or 'movie- goers' trash it for exceeding it's grasp. Wake up people! That's what we humans feel when we understand that some stuff are impossible to comprehend and that's exactly what that movie is trying to say to it's audiences. What people want instead is to have answers on a plate brought before them. That's plain superficial and not deep or intriguing yet alone mind-blowing as this movie is called.Another problem in this film is that the human kind appears to be too advanced in 2001. We actually didn't advanced much since 1920's till 1960's, so what possible miracle could make us advance so much in 40 years? Even now with all of this technology we don't advance, but sometimes remain the same in some ways. That's one of the big problems with old sci-fi movies... they show a 'not so distant future' that is so advanced beyond imagination and one that lacks realism... but the majority of film experts buy this cheap things that movies like this are trying to sell.In conclusion I'll give this movie only a 5... and that's for the visual spectacle that this movie unfortunately only is. I say 'only' because the intellectual and mind-blowing part is too well hidden and dragged that doesn't make me ask myself questions nor makes me realize that what happens in this movie will never happen due to our(or my) human limitations both physical and intellectual.",5,6,11,8 July 2014
La La Land," City of Stars
","La La Land is a wonderful musical movie that tells the story of Mia (played by Emma Stone) and Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling) and how they follow their dreams while also falling for one another. This movie reminded me of the musicals I saw when I was little (since I haven't watched one in years) and why these kind of movies are so lovely. The performances are on spot and of high quality, really gave me the sense of realism. Also the soundtrack is marvelous with songs like 'City of Stars', 'A Lovely Night', 'Another Day of Sun' or 'The Fools who Dream'. The cinematography was a delight... so many wonderful pictures and the mood that they were shot on gave the movie more realism (as if it didn't have enough already). The story was good... but sometimes felt a little bit sudden. And this is my only issue with the movie. There were some scenes that just happened without some good context to them... and I was like: 'ok how did we get here?' but it didn't bothered me so much so that it could ruin the experience I had with this movie. Also there moments in which I was like: 'This is gonna happen next!' Buy again it didn't bothered me or made me feel I was wathing a predictable movie. The execution was what made me enjoy it, even though some scenes were predictable. There was even some comic relief in it but it never seemed forced or in there just for the sake of being in there (like most of the recent Marvel movies). There is a scene at the end that will make most people cry... no spoilers here... I almost did and it was so surprising to see this type of scene done like it was done here, in a musical movie but it worked wonderfully to enhance the heart that this movie had.Overall a wonderfull movie that I longed to see it for quite some time now since it won 6 oscars this year. I would highly recommend it to musical movie lovers and to anyone who wants to watch a movie with good story and good acting by both the leading actors. 10/10.",10,4,5,23 December 2017
How to Train Your Dragon," One of the best movie experiences I've had in years!
","It took me a while to get to watch this movie, since I've heard and seen so much about it (that includes the TV show on CN). I only got the chance to see it recently this year and I was extremely pleasantly surprised by it.Recently I started watching movie trailers way more rarely than I did years ago... and that made me totally blind coming into this movie. I knew almost nothing about it and that made me experience the movie and appreciating it a lot more than I would have, had I watched the trailer/s.From the first scene this movie captured my attention and made me interested in the story since it was something about medieval times and dragons. And being a somewhat fan of Game of Thrones I was hooked on from the moment Hiccup told the story about Berk and the fight against the dragons. First of all the animation and the way this movie is created is absolutely stunning and way ahead of its time. The story got me from the first moment and there wasn't a single moment where I was 'can we get over with this to move on to something more exciting?'. The 98 minutes flew by me and I felt inspired, moved and most of all motivated throughout the whole movie. The soundtrack... now I gotta address this... John Powell was robbed of Oscar in 2011. I don't care what anyone else says about that... I've seen The Social Network and that soundtrack was absolutely horrible. There were at least three other soundtracks in 2010 way better than that: The King's Speech - Alexandre Desplat, Inception - Hans Zimmer, and this one. Now I understand that you shouldn't award another oscar to a composer who already won one (Hans Zimmer) but how could the academy rob John Powell of the oscar is beyond me. His score was inspiring, powerful, well suited for the time frame in the movie and motivating. There were tracks that while the movie was playing and the scene was going, it made me shed tears of joy and inspiration. Now that doesn't happen often and I can only name a couple of movies that did that to me: Interstellar, Braveheart, Avengers: Infinity War, The Dark Knight, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, ... I can honestly say that the best part of the movie was the score. The other great parts were, aside from the story which I already mentioned, the conclusion, the interactions between the characters and how everything tied together with everything.I could go on about the animation, cinematography or voice acting but for me a movie with a captivating story, wonderful soundtrack and inspiring and motivating moments is enough to call a masterpiece. And this is for me a masterpiece. One of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life!",10,1,1,6 April 2019
The Shape of Water," Good but not Great!(1st part spoiler free, 2nd part with spoilers)
","***SPOILER FREE REVIEW BELLOW!***
I watched this movie not seeing any of the trailers but only knowing about its huge hype especially now when the oscars season comes. I knew the premise for this movie so thinking about it before the movie played I was pretty much imagining the whole film in my mind. And most of what I imagined the movie to be, it was. And you might say: Oh, that's a good thing that a movie matched your expectations. But to be honest judging by the hype this movie got and by the number of awards it got I was expecting the movie to surpass my expectations. Not to say that I don't like the movie, I enjoyed it but if you've seen most of the best movies out there you pretty much seen this movie too. And that's one of the first things that bothered me with this movie... that it had so many cliches just to make the plot go forward but in retrospective when I think about them it kinda makes me wonder how could the critics find this movie soo spectacularly awesome? Next thing is the weird scene transition... which bothered me in the beginning of the movie... it was so hard to see who each character was and the point of certain sub plots to the whole story of the movie. Another thing that bothered me was the nudity, blood, gore, violence and language that were used in this movie. It's just in plain contrast with the rest of the movie which is a sweet fairy tale. Other aspects I didn't like involve spoilers, so check them out bellow. So moving to what I liked: For me the actor that made this movie enjoyable was Michael Shannon. He gave one of his greatest performances ever. Extremely realistic and with a lot of depth he made this movie better for me honestly. Sally's performance was good but nothing special really compared to Michael and to see the academy nominating Richard Jenkins for best supporting actor is stupid to say the least compared to Michael Shannon. The cinematography was good although I didn't understand the use of dark and half shadows on almost every scene with a face in it. The amphibian for me seemed only like a plot tool and I didn't care so much for it but I'll talk more about that in my spoiler part. The story was good and entertaining with some boring parts in the beginning but with some fantastic scenes in the second and third act. All in all a very entertaining movie with great performances and a somewhat good story (although it has been seen in a whole bunch of other movies) that I would recommend to all those seeking a romantic fairy tale told in a more realistic and mature way.***SPOILER REVIEW BELLOW!***
So let's get real... In the scene where the amphibian runs out of Elisa's house he scratches Elisa's neighbor and somehow has enough blood to leave marks the shape of a hand with blood on walls so that Elisa could find him in an empty cinema theater? I was stunned and almost laughed at how poorly thought this scene was culminating with the empty theater which would not run a movie with no spectators now would it? Maybe only for Elisa and this creature so that they could have a sweet moment. And a final thing that bothered me before we get on to the thing that I liked was that in the beginning we see Elisa having these scars like the shape of a gills. And I was completely down for it... somehow this b*tch is going to have gills by the end of the movie. The whole picture and the fact that this movie had a amphibian creature for me screamed 'the girl will have gills by the end of the movie' and I was completely right about it... because surprise! by the end of the movie she and the creature live happily ever after in the water as amphibian beasts. When I saw that I literally laughed my ass off. And that is what bothered me with this movie: the difference in tones: you have vulgarity, nudity and violence combined with love, romance and fairy tale that really didn't worked at all for me. What I really liked was the scene where Elisa and his neighbor are talking about the amphibian beast and how if they would let it die they won't be much different than a creature like it. That was very touching and had a lot of meaning if you were into the movie at that point. Another great scene of course is the escape scene. Until then I was mostly bored by the movie but that scene picked up the pace and the movie never slowed down from there. It was beautifully made with as few movie cliches as possible and I really liked it. The last scene was really tense with Dr. Hoffstetler getting killed and then tortured by Strickland who after that finds the beast and Elisa shoots them both but is then killed by the amphibian due to the creature regenerating powers which was kind of a plot twist since the creature healed Elisa's neighbor (shadows of The Green Mile here) so I bought it and it was really a god end to Shannon's character and a fitting one. But the end just screwed this movie for me with Elisa being resurrected as an amphibian beast to live happily ever after with her beloved beast. This was inconsistency 101 for me and I wrote more about this in the previous rows from this spoiler review. Aside that I really enjoyed the movie but it wasn't the WOW thing that every critic and the oscars are making it to be. 7/10",7,2,5,1 February 2018
The Lion King," The Lion King... more than just a cartoon!
","Just watched this movie, and I can't believe how good it was. At first when I saw the music and all the poetry i sad 'man, this won't be good'. How wrong was I.This movie is a story of Simba's character, and the way he became a full grown man although in the beginning He was just a naughty little lion. And the great thing about this movie is that you can learn so much from it, about family relationships and how to find your way in the society.Great movie again... fun to watch especially when Timon & Pumba showed up. Maybe the film was a little bit short, just an hour and a half but overall great movie. 10/10!",10,0,0,25 July 2013
Inception," If you rate this with one star, you're exactly as stupid as Mr. Nolan thinks you are!
","My inspiration for this review is another review on this movie called 'You're not as stupid as Mr. Nolan believes you are'. Why? Because you believe somebody is trying to sell their product and along with that fool you? I don't think it's that simple! Here's why:1. You're exactly as stupid as mr. Nolan thinks you are if you decide to stop watching after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I agree though that the beginning is nothing special, but at least give it a try and then you'll see what was about that beginning.2. You're exactly as stupid as mr. Nolan thinks you are if you try to figure out what is it with that dream machine. It's a Science Fiction people! There must be things that will not make sense. This is the Sci-fi world!3. You're exactly as stupid as mr. Nolan thinks you are if you compare this movie to Matrix. I'm not a fan of that movie, but let's just say that is not the most logical movie ever. While here everything that happens in the dream world follows a familiar pattern of real life dreams. The way you get kicked out of it, how real it seems, and the idea of all possibilities. 4. You're exactly as stupid as mr. Nolan thinks you are if you criticize this movie for it's theories about dream share. That never happened in real world, it's science fiction, again, that's why here we should give the credit to the director and embrace the way the shared dreams work.5. You're exactly as stupid as mr. Nolan thinks you are if you believe that he remained in the dream. Now i'll not explain the whole movie at this point, but let's just say that reality was the only place he could go. Remember he was sedated in the reality, and Saito died in the first dream that's why he went to limbo in the first place, to get Saito back from there. So Cobb going after Saito meant that he wouldn't feel the kick from the second dream resulting in him not waking up in the water-filled car from the first dream, so he died in the first dream. So even if he was shot by Saito in limbo and returned to the first dream he was dead there and had to wake up in reality. Not convinced? Go check the cast and see that there are two sets of children one with James 20 months and Phillipa 3 years and one with James 3 years and Phillipa 5 years. Yet another proof that if you rate this movie with 1 you didn't payed any attention at all to see if his children were older in reality and if he was wearing the wedding ring in reality or not, and so on...In conclusion I say only this even if I could have written a poem about how amazing was the score the cinematography or the visual effects, I'll say only this: This is one of a kind movie that keeps the most of it's viewers on the edge of their seat with a brilliant idea and excellent storytelling. The main idea of this movie is that the team is like a movie cast(director, producer, ex producer, visual effects man, screenplay and lead actor) trying to deliver a good show to impress Fischer(the audience) and in the same time to plant an idea into his mind.So going back to the final scene. Was it all a dream? Of course! It's a movie isn't it?",10,0,2,18 December 2014
WALL·E," Surpassed my expectations in every way possible!(no spoilers)
","Until 2008 Pixar has made a name for itself with great movies like Toy Story and Finding Nemo, but after seeing this movie I realized that that was only the end of the beginning for Pixar. Wall-E is a movie directed by Andrew Stanton and tells the story of a cleaning robot in a futuristic Earth who unwillingly gets involved in a space journey that could very well affect the whole humanity.Honestly the first movies that brought me into Pixar universe were Toy Story trilogy and Finding Nemo and some years later (as in this year) I decided to watch some more. Firstly I started with Coco then I watched Zootopia and they quickly become my favorite from Pixar. That was until I saw this movie which honestly is at least as good as those if not even better and maybe best Pixar movie ever? The story is so simple and yet so captivating and full of mystery. It quickly caught my attention from the first moments blending humor and intrigue with mystery extremely well. Let me tell you that the main robot in this movie is adorable and at times extremely inspirational. The movie itself is inspirational and also very mature with themes that resonated with and spoke to me. For example themes like: what will happen if our self-convenience would put a hold on us and made us lazy? or... What will happen in the future to our planet if we continue to exploit it as hard as we do it now and not caring for it at the same time? What could happen if we could create AI and let it slip from our control and having them controlling us? These themes are so well explored while the movie is also entertaining that it makes movies like T2 or Matrix (which in my opinion are not at all good) or Interstellar look like a child written movies. I had expectation before watching the movie expecting a entertaining animated movie with a lot of fun but what I got was even more: excitement, entertainment and inspirational art. I understand how this movie got nominated for best screenplay because it's maybe as good as The Dark Knight was that year (also that movie didn't got nominated for screenplay although is one of the best movies of all time). That's why for me this is The Dark Knight of animated movies. It is on a different level from any other animated movies along with Coco, Zootopia and Toy Story 3. The animation was incredible... I mean 10 years later and it still looks like a movie released at least last year if not this year. The music was phenomenal and it is a shame that such a wonderful and brilliant composer like Thomas Newman still hasn't won an Oscar although he deserved at least one or two Oscars. As for gripes with this movie... there were certain parts where it was hard for me to think about certain events' explanations while enjoying the movie although by the end everything comes full circle and it's extremely well done. Aside from that this movie is pretty much flawless and one of the best if not THE best from Pixar.Overall a fantastic movie with superb story, great animation, mature themes and messages and a wonderful score. 10/10",10,1,1,20 February 2018
Arrival," When Independence Day meets Interstellar! (no spoilers)
","I watched this movie because it was in my 2017 oscar highlights list and I gave it a try to see how it is. Arrival is directed by Denise Villeneuve who also directed Blade Runner 2049 (which I didn't like at all) and tells the story of a linguistic teacher who is hired by the military to try to communicate with the arrived aliens.Honestly I was skeptical about this movie having watched Blade Runner 2049 some months ago and at the same time I was realistic and opened for this movie to maybe blow me away. I was constantly intrigued and amazed by this movie. This movie for me is without a doubt the best movie of 2016 along with Hacksaw Ridge. Is a very thoughtful movie with a very deep message that at the same time manages to surprise the viewer in ways that you couldn't even imagine. At the beginning I was intrigued by the concept of aliens arriving on earth and how would it be to try to communicate with them but the movie really took me in directions I didn't expect and rewarded my patience throughout the runtime. Let's start with Amy Adams' performance which was mesmerizing and one of her best in recent movies. She was calm relaxed and almost effortlessly pulled this character with so much depth and motivation. I can't understand why she wasn't nominated for an oscar. Emma Stone did not have a overwhelmingly better performance than Amy's considering the fact that Adams did this in a sci-fi movie and Emma did it in a musical. It is disturbing to see her too (after Matthew McConaughey for Interstellar) being robbed of a Oscar nomination in her case by Maryl who was probably nominated only for being a Hollywood legend like Denzel in the same year(because the next year she was nominated again). Next, the visuals are outstanding but compared to Jungle Book they couldn't match those. The score was great... a very haunting score that suited almost every scene. The story is absolutely fantastic. It reminded me a little about Interstellar's story and it kinda resembles to that in way. It has the emotional pump by the end just like Interstellar did and it also has twist and turns you wouldn't expect in a sci-fi like this. Another thing I liked was the realism in it. Just like in interstellar it starts with scientifical concepts and then takes turns and new directions that go in the sci-fi realm and actually surprised me a lot. There are also flashbacks which in the beginning seemed unnecessary but by the end went full-circle and had such a tremendous impact on me. No point trying to point out the directing and cinematography which are all fantastic. I have only two gripes with the movie and that is spoiler territory which I'll address bellow, but aside from that this movie is flawless and is so similar with Interstellar that for me is impossible to not like it and consider it one of the best sci-fi ever.***SPOILER HERE***
So the thing that bothered me was that the movie never fully explained who were the aliens and why they'll need human help in 3000 years. The second and last thing that bothered me was that in the end the aliens and Louise were able to talk so easily with each other despite the fact that they spend more than half the time of the movie trying to learn each other's language.
***END OF SPOILERS***Aside from that this movie is awesome and mind-blowing with fantastic performances and great story. It amazes me how this movie got nominated for best picture, director, adapted screenplay, cinematography, production and sound and Interstellar didn't receive any nominations for cinematography, directing or motion picture since they are pretty much the same thematical movies. 10/10",10,1,3,6 February 2018
Back to the Future Part II," The Unnecessary back to the future...
","Even from the ending of the first part, the plot of this movie sounded idiotic. Here's why:Marty has to go to the future to change something that hasn't even happen? I mean what could he changed since the future hasn't happened yet? Isn't his duty warned by 'Doc' to prevent those bad things from happening rather than travelling to the future and then having hundreds of complications? And I just realized what this movie promotes: laziness as a parent. Why should you be responsible for your kids growth when you can hop on a time machine and fix whatever they do wrong in the future. Just think about that for a second. Movies used to inspire people to be mature, open-minded and responsible, not this one anyway. Yes, I know why... because we need a sequel! And that's the only reason this movie exists: to make Back to the Future to have a sequel. Not because there was a logical reason for it... illogical reason is the motif for this movie existing(if you catch my irony here).Aside from that the movie had horenderous acting with sooo many over the top performances that were made either for children or to emphasise the good or bad guys. Then there is the famous 'un- futuristic' future that soo many movies from the 20th century had. Next, there is more illogical things like Biff somehow knowing how to set the flux capacitor and the time date and TRAVEL IN THE FREAKING PAST! How can I be the only one who thinks this is ridiculous and ilogical??? Did he had a course on how to use the deLorean time machine? No. Did he ever saw it? No. Then why did he assumed that it was a time machine? Because the plot needed to get more complicated that's why. And yet so many people accept this soo easily and call this one of the best sequels ever. Well... in my opinion is one of the worst movies of all time due to the ilogical plot, un-futuristic future, unnecessary complications, cringy acting and ilogical story made for kids.If there is ever a 0 rating or if IMDb decides to introduce percentages along with movie ratings I'll gladly rate this garbage with 0.Oh... but calling this thing garbage would be an insult to the things I throw away.",1,5,19,3 August 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Great comic book adaptation, not as good as a cinematographic experience(minimal spoilers)
","So, after some months of re-watching this movie and thinking about it here's my real review:The Good: As you can tell from the title, excellent comic book portrayal. I can see that Zack Snyder has done his homework about how the superheroes should look like, or be like in the comics just like he did in Watchmen, but there he had most of the plot and screenplay written from the book, while here he used David S. Goyer again but now in combination with Chris Terrio(Oscar winner) and the result? you'll see it at the bad section. The action scenes are insane, and very comic book style, not to mention the way the superheroes use their abilities. Not even one comic book adapted movie had the courage to do something like this, and yes this time are less casualties than in Man of Steel. Batman was excellent, but the only problem was his inner law of not killing that we didn't see in the first half or quarter of the movie in Ben Affleck's version, but I like that after his fight with Superman he goes back to that rule. Wonder woman was great, very bad-ass and very likable as a character. Superman didn't shine, although Clark did(in the Ultimate Edition that's so), and I'm still waiting for that leader attitude from the comics that made him such a confident and wise leader of the Justice League(Cavill's version is more like a revenge Superman). Oh, and the score is simply amazing, too bad the movie doesn't raises up to the quality of the soundtrack. That's pretty much it.The Bad: So many plot holes. I mean for a movie like this there are tons of plot holes: from lead blocking Superman's vision to Lex Luthor knowing everything about Bruce and Clark's secret identities. The plot is sloppy, although you can see Chris Terrio's design for the plot was one that was going to be clever, making Lex Luthor turning Batman and Superman against each other. But all this was ruined by David S. Goyer and his illogical screen writing. He also did a bad plot for Batman Begins but Nolan outdone him and made the movie shine even though there were some major plot holes there too. It seems he won't be writing the screenplay for Justice League, because with his illogical plot and Snyder's obsession for visuals, Justice League might have been doomed already. Way to many stupid decisions from all the characters were made only to drag the plot towards Batman confronting Superman, although in a Nolan movie, that would have been made more clever than this. Next, Jesse Eisenberg is wasted in a role that didn't make any sense for a comic book adaptation. OK, Lex Luthor is crazy in the comics, but not like this. He is crazy for power, revenge, domination over Superman, but not like this. He's in fact a very arrogant man with a plan(see Joker in TDK, how he turned Harvey against Batman), if they might have brought that to this Luthor not insanity, then this would have been a better movie. Lois again just a plot tool so that Superman could have someone to save, and the plot to continue, and so on, I could go on like this forever but there's a word limit.I won't touch the acting which was good especially from Affleck and Gadot, neither cinematography(I don't have a problem with dark tone and gray colors used), but I'll say that this movie has its good parts and should be respected for what is, and criticized for what's not, but critics can only see what is not of course. For me this would be a 60% fresh with 6.5 average rating, but things can be improved in Justice League, and by the looks of the trailer, they may actually be.So this is my honest opinion, giving this movie a 7 is more than sufficient.",7,2,3,10 August 2016
The Greatest Showman," Critics just proved that lately they are a bunch of morons!(no spoilers)
","Where do I start to explain why I wrote the title I did? Well how about a few months ago when Star Wars came out and I saw polarizing opinions but went to the theater anyway to see it. I was shocked by how bad that movie was on every level but mainly on story and logic. That was probably one of my worst movie experiences ever. Then let's take some facts here into consideration before talking about this movie. Almost all the star wars fans with some brain left in their head, hated the movie, yet it got 4 Oscar nominations including original score which was one of the most bland scores I've ever heard from John Williams(he even reused some of the episode IV music, that's how bad it was), and yet that movie got 92% on RT and 85% on Metacritic. Why? Sometimes I understand why some critics or persons might find a movie bad/good even though I have the complete opposite opinion, but here in the case of SW there is nothing to understand on why some people might like that movie. It's just complete garbage. And after this introduction you might know how I feel about this movie. The Greatest Showman tells the story of PT Barnum who has a dream of becoming a great showman and in doing so overcome his low social status. While not being the most artistic and stylish movie ever this movie succeeded in what it was trying to transmit: That chasing power or wealth might make you transform yourself into something you were never meant to be. This movie has so many powerful quotes at times and so many ideas that I was inspired and moved almost to tears during the whole runtime. The first aspect I'll touch is the performance of Hugh Jackman which is one of the most dedicating performance I've seen from him. That was hinted from the trailer when I saw something very different in his character and that was confirmed throughout the whole movie. Next the set pieces and costumes were stunning and gave the movie a huge sense of realism and made me feel like I was there in that period of time. Last but not least the soundtrack along with the songs was sublime, one of the best I've ever heard. The songs from this movie were hands down the best from any musical period. There were at least 3 songs worthy of Oscar nods(but since it didn't had the critics response as La La Land did it didn't happen) and those were: The Greatest Show, A Million Dreams and This Is Me(which should have won the Oscar although I loved Remember Me from Coco). Now the problem critics had with this is that it wasn't a classical musical, it didn't follow the same pattern La La Land or other previous musicals did. For me it seemed like a Pixar movie both in length and in pacing. That was probably one of the only gripes I had with this movie is that it's pacing was somewhat rushed at times because of it's short runtime. That meant some slightly undeveloped conflicts that honestly, looking back needed development only for retarded people like the critics(I mean if you saw X-men or know about the african-american discrimination you'll totally understand some of the movie conflict). But aside from that this movie was flawless in my opinion and it did what I expected to do ever since I've watched the song This is Me on youtube(you know the behind the scenes one) that brought tears to my eyes even though I didn't see the film at that time. Overall sublime songs and soundtrack, fantastic and extremely dedicated performance from Hugh Jackman and great message along with inspiring ideas make this movie one of 2017's best movies in my opinion. 10/10",10,1,3,6 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Quite possibly the worst movie ever!(IMO)
","People said when episode I came out that it was the best Star Wars ever. But in time when the hype cooled down they realized how stupid that movie was. This one is no exception. Please do not take this review personally, it's just an opinion.Story: As we all know now it's a massive copy of the original trilogy's story. And if you pay attention literally everything is exactly the same like episode IV for at least 1/2 of the movie. Just taking things from the OT and making them bigger and more bad-ass or more modern doesn't make for a good film making. But yeah... whatever, moving on. Another major issue this movie has is that it doesn't give any context to anything since it copies episode IV. That worked there because it was the first movie, but here... nah... there are so many questions like how the Resistance and the First Order came to be, how Maz got Luke's light-saber, how does San Tekka got the map to Luke, how does Finn and Rey master light-saber so quickly, who were the knights of Ren or how did Kylo betrayed Luke? Just some questions that came to my mind. Aside from that the story felt rushed, more of the same Rebel vs Empire stuff without any context whatsoever to it. Even the last light-saber battle between Kylo and Rey is a copy of Obi vs Anakin in episode III, bad guy gets injured and then is taken to his master to be trained again(similar to Anakin being taken back to Emperor to be rebuild and basically become Darth Vader).Plot holes: Finn and Poe crash near the same village Rey was in although they crashed from space, Han and Chewie just so happens to find the Millennium Falcon in the same moment Rey and Finn were in. Rey just so happens to know how to pilot a spacecraft or use the force even though she only heard about it for like couple of hours or so. Ground breaks just between Rey and Kylo to separate them so conveniently at the end, so that we could see another face-off in the future.The tone and fan service is just exaggerated. The movies just doesn't know when to stop with all the Easter eggs and OT references that in the end the whole movie feel like a parody to the old movies. At least the prequels had a original story and creative. The prequels failed due to poor film making. This episode instead is a cheap written homage to the original saga, and doesn't stand on it's own. The star-killer is just another stupid addition that makes no sense whatsoever from how it powers to it's weaknesses(episode IV and VI), that show how idiotic the plot of this movie really is, having the First Order not learning anything from the Empire's failures?The soundtrack is bland and probably the worst. Aside from Rey's theme there is no other track that stands on it's own. Kylo's theme is a rehash of Imperial March. At least Rogue One had a more decent one and that soundtrack was composed, arranged and mixed in only 4 months while this movie had 5 months just to mix it with the movie itself.The cast is totally underwhelming. Although there are guys with so much potential, they are wasted due to the lack of vision the writers had in mind. Just one example: Finn decided to leave the storm-troopers because of the killing he would have needed to do, yet in his escape he kills more of his former colleagues which contradicts his character motivation completely and makes no sense whatsoever.TFA betrays the legacy of the original trilogy. After Han dies Chewie screams and Leia is looking sad. Yet when they arrive Chewie pasts Leia as nothing happened. If this was a continuation of the OT they would have been devastated, especially Leia, since she had a son with Han. Luke running away because one student betrayed him? Leaving more death and destruction in the galaxy? The old Luke confronted Vader when everyone told him to run away, yet here he's so scared that he hides on Oliver Queen's island. It just inconsistent. Aside from the artistically view and execution this movie had critical issues, and it was made only to please prequel haters. And I think JJ Abrams is not to blame here as much as the writers and especially Disney is. As Lucas clearly states in this video - : search these exact words 'What Happened in George Lucas' STAR WARS EPISODE VII' on YouTube and you'll find the thing I'm talking about - he backed out because Disney wanted to make a copy version of episode IV. Surprise? Well Disney succeeded in destroying the Star Wars saga through this idiotic movie.PS: You want to see an entertaining sequel to an old franchise, go check Jurassic World. OK it's a cliché ride but at least is more original than this piece of cr6p.",1,31,37,6 January 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," So close...
","For it to be a masterpiece for me and one of the best movies I've ever seen. That spot belongs to Lord Of The Rings The Two Towers. This movie has some of the best moments in cinema history but at the same time the biggest Deus Ex Machina of all cinema. So for me, this movie just doesn't feel like the best movie ever nor like the best in the trilogy.So first we have Saruman's death scene which wasn't included in the theatrical release if I understand, but a scene that concluded this character's chapter and ended in a very cruel and deserving way. Next is a scene which is possibly the most epic scene ever put to screen. And that is ride of the Rohirim. Every single time I watch it it gives me goosebumps, makes me cry of excitement and it inspires me to just like the horsemen did, charge any difficult situation without fear. The entire battle although not on the same level of catharsis as the one from The Two Towers, is one of the greatest battle sequences of all time. The thing that I always hated about it was the intervention of that ghost army which in my opinion was just invented in this movie to give conclusion to a otherwise impossible-to-win battle or scenario. Sounds like a Deus Ex Machina already? Oh, wait and see what's next... The next awesome scene was the fight between Sam and She Lob. Man ,that was a scary, emotional and epic fight between a small hobbit and a big spider creature. That just showed how much the character of Sam evolved along the journey op these three movies. The next and last awesome scene in this movie literally ends with the greatest Deus Ex Machina of all time. An it is the battle at the gates of Mordor. The idea is brilliant and the battle, the speech, the charge are all epic. But then this happens... Not only that the eagles (who could have literally carried Frodo and Sam to the Mountain - since they carried back from it- but didn't because the plot of the trilogy didn't need them to) come and fight the nazguls but when Frodo and Smeagol fight and fall (another great scene, not to mention Frodo's turn to the Dark Side) the ring gets destroyed and then this happens: Literally everything that was part of Mordor dies or gets wiped out, but not only that even the earth beneath the gate appears to have a mind of its own and undermines exactly in the shape the orcs were when they were surrounding Aragorn and his army, in a circle shape and every man survives but almost every bad guy gets whipped out (and people complain about the Night King being killed with a dagger). It's just the biggest Deus Ex Machina ever because: 1. Nowhere in the trilogy was it ever established that through the power of the ring was Sauron created, or his army, or the land in Mordor or the tower and so on and so forth... 2. The ring was made to control other rings not to have like a God-like power over everything Mordor-related. and 3. It's the cheapest way to write yourself out of a tricky situation. Going onwards with the gripes I'll say that the ending was really long and stupid at the same time. Sure watching Gandalf and Bilbo depart was fine because their story was basically over, Frodo had no reason to leave and the lines he gives to motivate his departure are just cheap and hollow (not to mention extremely slow).In conclusion, this is a movie that gives me very conflicting feelings. On one side has some of the greatest moments in cinema that I have ever seen, but on the other side has so big flaws and cheap writing in some scenes that just doesn't make it a fabulous movie or a masterpiece for me. Not to say I didn't like it... man I almost loved this movie but its problems cannot be denied. I know I won't...",9,0,0,12 July 2019
The Truman Show," One of the best movies of the decade!
","Had the chance to watch this movie only now, but I was completely stunned by how good this movie was. When I'll think back on the classics of this decade (the 90's) like The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Saving Private Ryan, The Green Mile I'll be adding this movie too.The premise was very simple and yet the way the movie develops itself is fantastic. You basically know from the get-go who Truman is and what's The Truman Show. The Show itself is what surprises you, moves you, inspires you on so many levels. I'll mention some of them: 1. First there's the manipulation theme which by the way mentioning it in my time (the year I write this review) is so relevant and is amazing how a movie 21 years old at this time was able to predict something so big that is sort of happening right now. 2. Then there's the freedom theme which in this instance basically says: don't be what others or what this world may want you to be. Be yourself, find your own unique path! 3. This one is one that basically tormented Hollywood for decades to come and is the Life is a lie thing or Life is irrelevant or Life is meaningless in the way that everything is just on a loop. Everything that happens is not real, that you are living only a scenario or a dream (see Inception).I could go on and on about the whole messages this movie transmits but you get the point. Aside from that the performances are all fantastic especially from Ed Harris and Jim Carrey who gives one of his best ever performances. The only thing distracting from that are his momentarily Ace Ventura- moments, but aside from that is maybe on par with his performance from Eternal Sunshine of the Spottless Mind. The score is fantastic and well suited for this type of movie. Everything else is just flawless and if I were to pick a thing that bothered me or a thing I didn't like I would have to really search and nit pick it.A masterpiece in every way possible that surprised me, inspired me, moved me and entertained me a lot. 10/10",10,0,0,21 July 2019
The Matrix," Am I the only one who thinks this movie is overrated?(Major Spoilers)
","I see that on this site only the positive reviews for this film are promoted to be on the first pages, which is at least one-sided if not preferential. This makes me think I won't even get read by other users yet alone supported by them(since they all find this movie awesome)... but whatever let me tell you what I think about this movie:The Story: Is probably the most important part of this movie and simultaneously the one which this movie gets so awfully wrong. 1. The concept of machines imprisoning humans was exploited so many times(Stargate for example had a similar concept driven episode) by so many TV Shows and movies, so I expected this movie to go deep in why would machines imprison humans and have authenticity in its core. I got 0 of that, in fact what did I got? Some stupid explanation saying the machines imprisoned humans because humans loose energy as heat through their skin. OK, it might seem plausible at first sight, but if you know a little about human or about chemistry you will find this concept ridiculous and impossible. Humans lose through heat about 30% of the energy they consume. So that would mean the machines would have to supply the humans with so much energy and then consume the 30% they lose through heat(basically 100% energy used to keep humans alive to 30% energy remained for machines. That means the machines would lose about 70% of the energy they have or invest into sustaining humans alive) why? Because the script says so. If they have that much energy to sustain humans and their necessities for so long why not kill the humans and stick to maybe consume lightning energy which this movie shows to be very satisfying. 2. The explanations Morpheus gives Neo are so thin, maybe thinner than a balloon inflated to its maximum. The Matrix was weaker at the beginning so that they escaped? Why hasn't anyone else escaped? How was the Matrix weaker? Does this movie or the next one in the trilogy explain this? No... But yeah because there's a bad-ass character saying these we all should believe this and then say that this movie is a benchmark for all sci-fi to come? I cannot believe that I'm living on this planet where people are fooled so easily by ridiculous explanations that are so thin and they think that they are smart by watching these kind of movies. Oh, but there's more... when other directors come up with a movie thought over 15 years(Inception) and so authentic and realistically executed that starts from correct premises and then exaggerates like any other movie, people make reviews like: 'Overrated because it makes people 'feel' smart...'. It's incredible that a director that has been making movies since 7 years old and thinks so much about its movies is repaid with bad reviews from people who clearly didn't understood the movie and don't care about dreams, while this movie gets so much praise for having an incorrect premise that just becomes worse as the movie progresses. 3. There's no plot twist that can make you say: Yes this movie was thought from start to finish. This movie is just a bunch of action scenes mixed with some poorly explained concepts that have an incorrect scientifically premise and has just enough of all of them to fool the average audiences.The Action: The only part in which this movie succeeded was the action which indeed revolutionized the action flicks back then. Along with the CGI this makes the movie watchable at best(for me at least). But here there are some unexplained things like why if you kiss a person connected to the matrix that person revives and more... becomes even more powerful. It's like a children's movie where the handsome prince kisses the princes and she wakes up and then they live happily ever after. I expected much more from a movie praised by so many people, but I got 0 explanation for how Neo revives from Trinity's kiss. The Characters: Bland and boring... and so cold especially Morpheus, who was made like this maybe to make him appear more bad-ass. Neo's character is childish for a movie of this magnitude. The chemistry between him and Trinty is not convincing for me. I mean, for the duration of the whole movie she's just kicking ass like Neo, and then they suddenly are lovers... but their relationship has no development because the script is so poor in substance and creates no circumstance in which these characters might interact with each other beside kicking ass and saying one-liners.The Soundtrack:(gotta hurry, word limit) The most bland soundtrack I've heard in my life. For how this movie is promoted as being one of the best ever... I expected a soundtrack that could match this reputation. Actually if you search Don Davis, this composer is known only for Matrix and maybe Jurassic Park III but aside from that, he was never nominated for golden globe, bafta or Oscar(not to say that those matter but other great composers were nominated at least 10 times to Oscars or baftas). There was not a single iconic track in this movie and the score as whole is just forgettable and underwhelmed.Hope I could include everything I wanted to say in this review. I probably won't get any support for this review, because every person on this planet adores this movie and IMDb supports only good reviews for this movie. And as to why I rate this movie with 5 is because of the CGI and action scenes, because the rest: premise, story, substance or authenticity of the script are either missing or are so thin as a inflated balloon(oh, wait the rating of this movie is as inflated as a inflated balloon... inflated by average people who like only mindless or pseudo-intelligent action).",5,1,3,16 March 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," One of the best movies of 2016! (1st part spoiler free, the 2nd part with spoilers)
","***NO SPOILERS BELLOW***
This wonderful movie tells the story of Desmond Doss who joins the military but refuses to ever touch a gun. This is a powerful and touching movie about maintaining your beliefs and how those actions can inspire other people. The movie style resembles a lot with 'Braveheart' and in general with Mel Gibson's way of directing a war-based movie. The performances are top notch especially from Andrew Garfield which gives one of the most original and different performance of his career. The story is original and challenging for both war-movie lovers and for drama-movie lovers. ***SPOILERS BELLOW***
One of the most powerfull scenes from the movie is one that was inspired almost word by word from Desmond Doss interview shown at the end of the movie. And the scene is the one where Desmond saves all those 75 soldiers. This scene summarized very well the authenticity of the movie and how much it stays true to the actual fact-based story which is rather odd for a Mel Gibson movie (you know what I mean if you've seen 'Braveheart'). But, for me the most inspiring and also the best scene in the entire movie is when Desmond saves a Japanese soldier. This scene sends a powerfull message about how your actions even if they may seem very odd but as long as they are made from clean conscience and with a good motivation, can inspire other people to do wonderful things also. And this is what this movie tries to do with its message that as long as you keep yourself clean and strong in your beliefs you can become an inspiration for others. The way this movie is constructed is very much like a Gibson style movie starting with childhood then youth and finishing with adult period. This makes the viewer involved in both the story and the main character and also makes the movie message the more easy to send and be later understood. The characters are also very well developed along the movie especially Desmond but others as well. As an ecample for the previous statement we see Smitty more as a bully at the beginning of the movie and then during the battles and the time spent with Desmond he becomes more of a mature and likeable character. This thus further proves the movie message that one action can inspire so many other people to be better and do wonderful things as well.The score is excellent with many memorable moments that I recognised even while I was watching the movie (can't say the same about John Williams' scores which weren't memorable not even when I listened the score separately without the latest Star Wars movie) which is surprising for a composer that I only heard in Wonder Woman before, but one that can be a one to watch (or listen) for from now on. Overall a wonderful movie, one of the best I've seen in years, and up until now the best from 2016 along with Rogue One and La la Land. 10/10",10,2,2,26 December 2017
Warcraft," Entertaining, but needs some clarifications(minimal spoilers)
","First of all, I'm not a Warcraft fan so haven't played the games... Here's my honest opinion:The good: The CGI is beyond awesome, and I can honestly say that is better than Avatar or Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, but just like these two movies, it has it's cartoonish moments, but that didn't disturb me... Next, the story's core, or the way the story would have looked like is very nice, simple, rehashed, but very nice introduced on screen. The fights were extraordinary, very well choreographed and very intense. The characters are very nice, especially Durotan(who was my favourite), but it was hard for me at times to get familiar with so many names and characters, but they all fit in very good.The bad: There isn't any story to show us how the Orcs world was dying, and maybe show some of Gul'dan's fault. Maybe a 5-10 minutes intro like LOTR would have don it nicely. And that's why some people and the critics especially will find this movie bad for, the incomplete story, but that's not the big problem. For me the biggest problem is how Durotan figures out that Gul'dan was the problem for which their worlds were dying. It is literally a 3 minutes scene where something happens and then a cliff talk and that's how Durotan figures it out. How I said earlier, it would have made sense a 5-10 minutes story of the orcs, that would hint some things pointing towards Gul'dan's fault. The last problem is the lack of character development. The characters literally are shown in cut scenes just so the plot can go further, but there isn't really any development of them, maybe a longer runtime, and a more focused approach could have solved this.So is the video game to movie curse broken? In a way... but this movie has some aspects to improve upon, but what I enjoyed most about it was that it felt like LOTR, a fantasy movie, and a welcome into a big universe of potentially great future movies. So, I rate this movie with 8 for the great effort that was put in making this movie. Of course the critics can only see this movie for what it's not, but I found it to be very entertaining, didn't made me sleep(like Ant-man did) so that's OK for me.It's worth it, and hope so that the sequel will be more developed.Cheers! :)",8,0,3,21 June 2016
The Social Network," The director is the real star here! (no spoilers)
","This is one of the movie I had on my watch list for a long time and which I wanted to see almost ever since it came out. I only had the chance now because I wanted to watch all the movies from the 2011 Oscar highlights list. The Social Network tells the story of the Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg and how he created Facebook and later dealt with the problems it raised. This movie is directed by David Fincher and it can be seen from almost the first shot. The cinematography and the pace of the movie reminded me most about Fight Club because this is mainly Fincher's style of movie making. This movie was a blast from start to finish. I was captivated and drawn into the story from the first couple of scenes. The movie is not shocking or with a lot of twists and turns but the way is directed feels like a live experience. This movie is 2 hours long but it felt almost like an epic of 3 hours because the pacing was somewhat fast and there were a lot of things happening in it. First of all the performances were all top notch especially from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield. The cinematography beautiful along with the directing which in my opinion should have won David Fincher the Oscar. The story is very realistic and extremely well told, I mean it captivated me even though there were no plot twists or CGI extravagance and props to the screenwriter for that. The only reasons I'm not giving this movie a 10 are 1. The poster for this movie is in my opinion misleading in a way that makes you think that the movie will be about how unsafe Facebook can be at times but the movie is almost about something completely different. 2. Some of the politics and laws were way to complex exposed in movie and it was hard at times to keep up with all of them. 3. The score was a big let down. Now, I know David Fincher wasn't renowned for being a director who utilizes music score very much to enhance the quality of the movie (example Fight Club) but this score won an Oscar that year and compared to Inception's score (which is the only one I know from the nominees that year) is completely underwhelming. I can't understand how they didn't gave the Oscar that year to Danny Elfman or Alexandre Desplat or other composers who I think did a better job than the composers for this movie did.Overall: A very interesting and captivating movie with terrific performances, great direction but with a slightly misleading poster that made me believe the movie was going to be about something else, some hard law science and poor score. 9/10",9,3,4,13 February 2018
The Fighter," An awesome story about fall, training and rise up! (no spoilers)
","This movie was the last movie on my 2011 Oscars highlights list to watch and it stars a stellar cast and tells the story of Micky Ward and how he tried to rise up to boxing glory just like his brother once did.Firstly this movie is filled with fantastic performances. From Wahlberg's very underrated performance to Amy Adams' wonderful portrayal of Charlene and to Christian Bale's superb and crazy acting. To this day that is one of Christian Bale's best performances and I understood why he got the Oscar in 2011. This was a very crazy performance but as the movie shows the real Dicky person by the end, a very accurate portrayal of this interesting character. Wahlberg's performance is one of the most underrated things in this movie. He was calm and natural and realistic for the most part of the movie. Seeing him not getting nominated was weird and seeing Melissa Leo winning best actress was even weirder. The story is very true to the actual fact although some times it can be seen that it's been hollywoodized with periods where the hero is beaten up and then miraculously wins somehow. But that is done in a very fine way that made me close my eyes and say 'yeah... it's ok!' compared to how the rest of the story unfolds. And really that would be my biggest gripe with the movie that sometimes the story gets somewhat hollywood typical and the boxing gets less real for more entertainment value, but that didn't took away too much from the quality of the movie. The story is very dramatic and very surprising and satisfying at times. There are lessons about redemption about rising up to big challenges and about trying to get everyone to support you the best they can while also emphasizing on how you should treasure everyone around you and take the best from everyone. This is a very motivational movie and a very realistic and well made movie with a great direction and superb cinematography that imitates the aura of television boxing very well. The music is just what you would need in this movie not being too sentimental and not too weird or unfitting for some sentimental moments, but gets the right balance between them. In conclusion: Great movie with fantastic performances, great story, great directing and powerful messages. One of 2010's best movies along with The King's Speech, Black Swan and Inception. 9/10",9,1,1,14 February 2018
