Hereditary," Good atmosphere but bad plot
","I was looking for more of a thriller than a straight up horror movie and this delivered...up to a point.The beginning starts off strong and keeps the suspense going (besides some overly drawn out scenes). However, the last 1/4 seems like they threw everything at the kitchen sink to make it a generic horror movie. Rituals, climbing on walls, flies coming out of the attic, book burning, satanist symbols, just the usual demon horror stuff.The biggest disapointment is that the storyline is weak and can be summarized in one sentence. Grandma is a Satanist and wants 'the king of hell' Paimon, to possess the body of her grandson instead of her granddaughter.The movie doesn't really explain the lore or history of the demon nor the purpose of summoning him which would have given the plot more depth. Instead, we just get a generic, overdone demon/religious horror movie that has been done time and time again.",5,0,1,1 November 2018
