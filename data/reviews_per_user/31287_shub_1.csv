Requiem for a Dream," Worst movie I ever saw...
","The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is anti-drug. Other than that, all I can do is to urge you to avoid it like the plague -- there's not enough anti-depressant in the world to compensate for the way this movie will make you feel.Even the most masochistic person in the world can be bludgeoned so many times before they've had enough.  I had had enough in the first five minutes, but stupidly kept watching in hopes that something redeeming would ultimately be displayed.  I was sadly disappointed.",1,7,14,12 February 2001
