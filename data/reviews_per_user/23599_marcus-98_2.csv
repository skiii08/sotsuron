E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Steven Spielberg's finest hour.
","ET is such a wonderful film.  I think its a film about the way a child views the world, and the way an adult views the world.  A child's mind is not cyncial, unlike the adults in the picture.  There is a vast gap between the child's world and the adult world.This is probably Spielberg's most personal film, he grew up in suburbia, he was part of a single parent family, he has a wildly imaginative mind. There are so many classic moments, more so than any film released in the last 30 years.  The bicycles flying past the moon is one of the greatest moments in cinema history.  The John Williams score is timeless. Unforgetable quotes 'ET phone home' One of the greatest of all time.",Null,1,2,26 February 2003
The Matrix," Best movies of the last 5 years.
","Firstly, I don't particuarly like Sci-fi movies, there have been some good ones, but its not one of my favourite genres.  Still I think that the most important and innovative movie of the last 5 years was The Matrix.  Cinema has been around for over 100 years.  In my opinion the most important events throughout its history have be; the introduction of sound in the late 20s, technicolour in the early 30s, relaxed censorship laws (more sex & voilence) in the 60s, 70s, 80s  onwards.  I think that in the 90s and now, technology is the new phenomenon.  There have been a lot of shabby special effects movies made over the past number of years.  Each trying to be bigger than the previous.  The  Matrix is the best special effects fuelled movies ever made.  It has turned special effects into an art form.  Its a progression, cinema has to go somewhere, it has to move forward.  Making movies with querky characters, interesting storylines, witty dialogue, its all been done before, and its great.  But surely we should be looking to do somthing cmpletely different.  I'm not saying special effects is the answer, but somthing, anything - Don't make me whatch the same movies over and over again evertime I go to the cinema.",Null,0,0,20 February 2003
