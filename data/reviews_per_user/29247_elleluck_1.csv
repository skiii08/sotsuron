Your Name.," Inspired by forces beyond human understanding
","I feel like this film was divinely inspired. It is beautiful, yet otherworldly. Without even trying, it hits hidden chords within the human psyche that bring out a torrent of feelings that we never knew we had, or had long forgotten about. When I watched it with my friends, who are normally chatty and sarcastic during movies - they were completely silent, awestruck immersed wholeheartedly. They were quiet, save for a few 'wows!' at the beauty and detail of the art in this film. When the credits came, they were still so enthralled they just watched the credit roll, without moving or wanting desperately to rush back to their busy lives and schedules. This movie nourished our souls and gave us something we didn't know we needed. We didn't know movies could be this profound, this touching, this meaningful. Think of the most touching and beautiful movie/scene you've ever seen, and loved, and it still doesn't come close to what this film has. Calling it a masterpiece isn't enough. It was more than a masterpiece. 10 as a rating isn't enough, either. There is no number great enough to pay back what this film has given me.",10,8,12,28 May 2017
