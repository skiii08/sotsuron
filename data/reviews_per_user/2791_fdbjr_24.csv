Blade Runner 2049," Lacking Intelligence - SPOILER
","No complaints about the casting, performance, or any of that, and special kudos to Ana de Armas who is luminous. The special effects are persuasive. So what's the problem?Like too many of Villeneuve's movies, this one is incredibly . . . dumb. NONE of the projections made about the world of 2049 make any sense at all. (This was not a problem with the original). Between now and then, we are asked to believe society will create an entire race of replicant human beings, the climate will be uniformly gray and dreary, all traces of urban sophistication or beauty will disappear, and all of this (of course) accepted without a whimper I'll leave the absurdities about climate and environment and focus on one thing - artificial intelligence. We DO have it, right now, and it has nothing to do with human DNA. It takes the form of robots made of plastic and metal elements, doing repetitive mindless work that human beings used to do, which is great for the time being, but poses a problem for the future. There aren't replicants now, there are never going to be, which makes the whole futuristic scenario an exercise in futility.SPOILER - by miles the worst scene is when the replicant detective (Gosling) stumbles in to an orphanage in which these poor little tykes are working in dark, claustrophobic conditions. Are you kidding me? Not only are these Dickensian scenes 150 years out of date, but any manufacturer is going to find regular robots far more efficient than a passel of children.All this may sound picky, but it's not. I love science fiction, but you have to have premises that relate to realistic social or human conditions. These don't. I strongly suspect Villeneuve came up with this implausible scenario so we can be told that 'no society ever succeeded other than on the basis of enforced labor' - dead wrong - and other holier-than-thou statements. The picture ends up having the same, narky feel as 'Incendies' or 'Prisoners', which is not where you want to be,Dystopian drama? Sure. Dystopian fantasy? Who needs that - which is why this movie is a grossly miscalculated boondoggle.",2,30,63,7 October 2017
The Legend of Bagger Vance," One Redeeming Scene ?
","This was a dreadful movie, incoherent, sentimental, peabrained and subtly racist. But there is one scene that I can't forget, and I wonder if it redeems the rest. The scene has nothing to do with the abysmal plot or the trivial main character. It was when the character Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill almost stole the show in the role) drives off the 18th into the surf. After the others play, the scene switches to him standing barefooted on the sand, in gorgeous twilight, knickers rolled up to his knee, with the over voice 'And then Hagen came back from the dead.' Maybe five seconds long, but pure beauty. The rest of the movie was dreadful, but that was almost worth it.",Null,1,3,1 May 2001
Requiem for a Dream," A Horror Movie
","This movie plays a lot more like a horror movie than a drama about addiction. The last forty minutes are hair-raising, with all sorts of well-known (but well-done) devices to spook the viewer. As a horror movie, I enjoyed it. As a study of addictive life, it is way, way over the top.",Null,0,0,22 June 2001
Source Code," Absolutely Unnecessary Coda - Contains Spoilers
","I happen to see this picture yesterday, with a friend of mine, and liked it quite a bit. But it illustrates an increasing problem with big budgeted movies. Spoilers follow.The movie opens with the hero, an Army helicopter pilot, coming to consciousness on a Chicago commuter train. He's being addressed by a pretty girl as her boyfriend. He has various interactions with other passengers. He has no idea of what's going on. As he's trying to figure out who and where he is, a bomb detonates, killing everyone.He finds himself back in a cell, something like a space capsule. He's informed that he's just been a part of a computer simulation, that the train was blown up that morning, that he's been cybernetically linked with the remnants of one of the victims (let it go, this is science fiction), and that his mission is to ID the bomber and prevent him or her from doing more damage. The simulation repeats and he's off again, a bit wiser, and wiser with every iteration.Now, you don't have to be an experienced science fiction reader (which I am) to figure out that the Army pilot is dead, that these computer people are hooking up his brain to the simulation. Live people don't end up inside computer programs. But this does come as a big surprise to the captain, and to the more naive members of the audience. And it does set up what should have been a really original ending.The hero finally completes the mission, having fallen for the girl along the way. He knows he's dead, and so is she, and all this is virtual reality. He pleads with the sympathetic operator to let him redo the simulation one last time, then let him die - completely. Touched, she agrees, even though the ogre chief of the project wants to 'wipe his memory' and use him again. And what happens in the last iteration is what should have made the movie memorable. Knowing this is his last remnant of consciousness, what he does the last time is make everyone in the train car happy. He's learned a great deal about them the other times through. He bets a comedian (whom he has recognized from television) all the money he has that he can't make everyone on the car laugh. The man takes the bet and proceeds to do just that. As the seconds tick down to the inevitable end, when they'll all be incinerated, he takes the girl in his arms, tells her he loves her, and wants to be with her forever. The frame freezes and pans the whole length of the car, revealing every passenger laughing or in various states of bliss. This is the instant that will see the hero into eternity.Not bad, completely unexpected, and, like the best twists, revealing that the theme of the drama was something completely different than the detective story it seemed to be. It's always nice to be surprised like that. I will confess to having to deal with moist eyes constantly at movies, and this was another occasion. A perfect ending. I reached for my hat, expecting the credits to roll up, and . . . . .. . . it wasn't over. It went on for another 15 minutes, into the most God-awful coda you ever saw, completely obliterating the premises of the story, so bad I am not going to describe it.What goes on? My guess is that when they previewed the movie, they found that the some members of the audience were dismayed that people as cute and likable as Jake Gyllenhall and Michelle Monaghan have to suffer the fate they do. A happy ending required. I think that's what happens, given production costs and promotion costs in the tens of millions. Trusting the better sense of the audience is a thing of the past. Too much sunk cost.",6,249,405,4 April 2011
Child 44," Well Done
","There are plenty of fair reviews on this movie, some that liked it, some that did not. I liked it, as my rating indicates. I'm mostly writing to express my disagreement with all those who viewed the movie as a betrayal of the novel. In my view, the novel was just awful - turgid, overwritten, with some action scenes that strained credibility, and a coincidence at the center of the plot that was beyond ridiculous. I detested the erstwhile Soviet Union, and the Stalinist years were hypocritical and vicious beyond Western understanding - but even at that, some of the descriptions of Soviet judicial processes in the book were extended to the border of caricature.In my view, one of the strengths of the movie was the craftsmanship of the screenwriter in transforming the mess of the novel into a workable two hour screenplay. The alterations in the plot were all to the good. The only concession to reality was the demonization of one of the villains. All in all, it became a pretty good melodrama, which did not unduly strain credibility, and to which the British cast (Tom Hardy in particular) gave the usual good service.",7,1,3,9 August 2015
Knives Out," Reviewing the Director
","Rian Johnson is a pretty hot property right now, what with the Star Wars credits, a decent science fiction movie, and so on. For a number of critics, the analysis of the movie ends there.Because this is flat out not a very good movie. The twists are not prdictable - far from it - so incredibly complex as to be completely unbelievable. At the center of the plot is an absolute absurdity. The patriarch of the family apparently committed suicide by cutting his own throat - an incredibly painful way to die - because he thought he had been accidentally overdosed with morphine. Absolutely absurd. Only he hasn't been overdosed because of an incredibly contrived series of events . . .. . . all of which have nothing to do with the various motivations of his heirs to do him in, established in some detail - the most entertaining part of the movie. As the movie goes on and drifts into the detail necessary to make all of the preposterous contrivances work, all this interesting background is completely lost, or ignored.Along the way a police lab is completely destroyed by the simple expedient of throwing an arson device through a window, because you know how insecure those places are. Etc., etc., etc.A splendid cast wasted. This is just not a very good movie.",4,5,17,28 November 2019
The Irishman," Reviewing the Credits
","This isn't a bad movie. It just isn't very good. It explores ground that Scorsese has been over and over and over - add a few more 'overs' - and that Francis Ford Coppola did first and best in 'Godfather'.De Niro and Pesci - both now in their late 70's - look mummified. Al Pacino doesn't look much better. The movie just plods and on and on - add a few more 'ons' - for 200 minutes, and then ends.The movie in my opinion is being praised for its credits, luminaries such as Scorsese, De Niro, etc. But the reality is the emperor does not have any clothes. It's just not a very good movie.",4,4,10,6 December 2019
Match Point," Masterpiece? Please!
","The first part of 'Match Point', about the drift of the hero into a passionate but adulterous affair, is pretty good. But even in these scenes there are problems. For example, there is a love making scene in a field in the rain. I guess it is supposed to resonate with unbridled passion - but all I could think of is how uncomfortable the lovers would be, in the cold English rain and damp prickly hay. I generally enjoy tasteful erotic scenes, but the concept is preposterous.However, this is small potatoes compared to the utter idiocy of the criminal plot and subsequent police work. The hero steals a skeet gun belonging to his father-in-law to murder his mistress by staging a robbery. He kills a neighbor, and then his girlfriend, the notion being that she surprised the thief. Both times the gun makes a polite little pop. Did Allen or any of the critics who praised this movie ever consider what sort of sound a skeet rifle ACTUALLY makes? When fired indoors? The entire building would shake. The reverbations would be heard for blocks around. The murderer would be found out in two minutes. The whole concept is utter nonsense. Hitchcock never overlooked such realistic details in his movies.But infinitely worse is the police work - the typical contempt of a New York intellectual for the solid common sense of everyday life. One of the detectives sees through the scheme. But he gives up when a drug addict is discovered with an item of jewelry from the theft. Allen actually believes the police are not going to wonder how such a derelict came to possess an expensive skeet rifle? Or what happened to it? Or will not run routine ballistic tests on the rifles the father owns, the hero's motive being known to them? That they will close out a double homicide on one flimsy, possibly coincidental bit of evidence? Do be serious. There is more thoughtfulness in the first five minutes of any 'Law and Order' episode than this.This movie is a little better than Allen's recent stuff - the drift into adultery is really good. But the plot twist is just plain stupid. The critics are rooting so hard for Allen that they overlook the sheer dumbness of the plot. But it is indeed dumb - so dumb that it wreaks havoc with the movie.",4,79,116,27 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Yoda's Comments
","Deadly dull, this movie is. Effects though plentiful, we before have seen. Wooden and stiff is Annakin the actor. Though Padme be fair of face, her attraction to Annakin, puzzling is. Early on, pizzazzz there was; lightness of spirit, aeriness of touch. Now the heavy side of the Force afflicts us; pondrous we are, weighty with our own religion. A movie this is, in a theater to be shown - a church it is not, or should not be. Too seriously perhaps George Lucas takes himself. A clinkeroo his movie is.",Null,0,0,20 May 2002
Incendies," Ugh (Spoiler)
","Like 'Blue Valentine', the virtues of this movie, its craftsmanship in terms of photography, performance, exposition, and so on, ultimately lead to its undoing. Its absolutely repulsive denouement simply destroys any viewer satisfaction in the whole. This is indeed the spoiler - the brother for whom the twins are searching, and the father, turn out to be the same person - with the added flourish that their conception occurred as the result of torture/rape.What exactly was the point here? Was there one? In 'Chinatown', which has a similar twist, the revelation is treated with horror and disgust (plus it explains eccentricities in the Faye Dunaway character). Here it says absolutely nothing about anything - in fact, the revelation is accompanied by the ludicrous hope of the dead mother that it 'will end the cycle of anger'.Are you kidding? What it's going to do is lead to permanent estrangement and alienation of all three, plus do permanent damage to the twins' self-perception.And what does any of this say about the Middle East? Or any larger human issue? Next to nothing.Disaster. Ugh.",3,20,46,16 February 2013
Baby Driver," Guns and Cars
","'Baby Driver' is a terrific looking, terrific sounding movie. It's full of guns and cars, some really well done action scenes. (A small problem I have with all these movies is where the hero learned to drive like that. He's very young, there are no schools .. . . you get the idea).The one small problem with the movie is that there is not one, single recognizable human being in it. None of these characters, none of whom is given a back story, has any recognizable human reality. It is difficult to imagine any of them existing in real life. Their sole raison d'etre seems to be to provide plot points and challenges for the lead character.And this is the fatal law. Movies are supposed to be about actual people. Even far-out science fiction only works if it provides commentary on real issues. This movie doesn't have any people in it. It's more video game than drama. A shame, because some of the action sequences are quite well done.",5,1,3,23 October 2017
The Shining," Disaster
","This is one of those movies that separates reviewers who watch movies with their eyes wide open and unawed by the name above the title, from the lemmings who basically stop thinking with the name of the director. The movie is perfectly awful. jack Nicholson plays the father as charmless from the outset, and seriously unbalanced from the start. The long gradual descent into semi-madness that makes the book memorable is completely missing. So, too, is the vivid description of the young boy as he gradually realizes the extent of his dilemma. The movie lacks subtlety, nuance, and suspense. If it had been made by anyone except Stanley Kubrick, it would have been relegated to the dust heap, where it justly belongs.",2,4,16,6 November 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Great Effects, But. . .
",". . . one of the silliest, dumbest movies ever made - particularly sad because the reason for the unexpected success of `Terminator' was its intelligence. (The first had very crude special effects.) The Killer Robot With a Song In Heart. The scene in which Linda Hamilton puts on her idiot marine colonel sunglasses and her khaki tank top and drives off to save the world has to be the dumbest scene filmed in the 90's.",Null,2,4,13 July 2001
Dunkirk," This Year's 'There Will Be Blood' . . . .Spoilers
",". . . . referring to another critic's darling that was actually a very, very bad movie.This picture is even more badly miscalculated than 'Interstellar', which is saying something. Historically, Dunkirk was a logistic miracle, in which a disorganized flotilla of amateur yachtsman managed to spirit off 300,000 plus British soldiers, trapped by Nazi forces.Now, if you want to do a micro story, fine. But you do have to put in scale. Instead, we have these meandering lines of soldiers on the beach, fewer numbers than in some cineplexes. We see nothing of the flotilla until 90% of the movie is gone, and even then it's a throwaway.The bulk of the movie is spent on a single ship, a single Spitfire, and a couple of rather unlikable soldiers looking for a way home. It took me quite a while to realize that the stories were not in sync, that I was looking at several different time frames. How clever! What totally unnecessary complexity!This might STILL have worked,except that Nolan does not bother with any more than the barest exposition of the characters. So instead of seeing the Grand Evacuation, we see the struggles of several ciphers, completely out of context.Add to that an ear-splitting, incomprehensible score, and you have - not a disaster movie - but a disaster.",2,31,56,22 July 2017
Pearl Harbor," Unbelievably Bad
","To all the negative comments, I can only add that the ending of this picture is so unbelievably bad it makes the mouth drop open. the forty minute sequence is terrific; everything else is astonishingly badly calculated. There isn't one single believable moment, mood, line, or attitude - and it all terminates in five minutes of the stupidest ending anyone ever wrote. That this guy wrote Braveheart is hard to believe.",Null,0,0,30 May 2001
The Usual Suspects," Defines Stylish
","This picture defines stylish. The structure of the script is terrifically clever. and an astonishing amount of plot is presented in a relatively short time. The cast is excellent. However, although the particular mechanism of the final twist is interesting, anyone who didn't see (or at least suspect) it doesn't go to too many films.          I believe the real appeal of the picture is the identification with the criminal mastermind Keyser Sose; monstrously evil types have exercised a fascination for audiences since Christopher Marlowe. But ultimately that is pretty shallow stuff. The picture gets an A+ for style, a B - or C for substance.",Null,0,1,31 August 2001
The Number 23," A Modest Surprise
","I took my daughter to this as she rather enjoys Gothic movies. Based on the reviews, I was not expecting much. However, there is some octane in the cast and directing, so I hoped for production values. What the picture turns out to be is an extremely 'plotty' yarn about a man lost in the maze of his own history. A lot of the exposition involves the hero recounting the plot of a novel he's reading - this was done extremely effectively, and hats off to Schumacher for the technique.As for the rest, it's all story - and if you are interested simply in a narrative unfolding simply for the fun of finding out what happens next, it's not bad at all. At any rate, I had fun with it, and I did not expect to.",Null,1,3,27 February 2007
Hero," Superb Movie
","Most of the negative comments on this movie I believe missed the point. Although it has a plot, it is stylized to the point of resembling a kabuki drama. The action is not intended to be realistic, but ceremonial. The metaphor is ballet, or kabuki, not an action film. This is the difference between 'Crouching Tiger', which - despite the aerial fantasy - was definitely an action picture.This isn't. It's like watching a Chinese fairy tale or legend come to life, or perhaps a 16th Century morality play. The resemblance to 'Rashomon', mentioned by a few reviewers, is misstated. The same story is retold, but there is never any confusion of perspective, which is the theme of Kurosawa's masterpiece.One the viewer accepts the notion that he is seeing a pageant, or masque, rather than a realistic movie, the picture becomes a wonder. It is one of the most spectacularly beautiful pictures ever shot. Almost every frame is a good still in itself, and the balletic action scenes are staged so as to give all the colors of the sets full range. Just to name one example, an aerial (in the Crouching Tiger sense)combat between two characters, both dressed in blazing red, amid trees whose leaves are a brilliant autumnal orange. The spectacle has no parallel in any film I have ever seen, and it is only one of any number I could cite. An amazing achievement.",Null,1,1,12 October 2004
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Flavor of the Original
","I am just back from the movie, and a little amazed at some of the so-so reviews. Based on those, I was expecting the movie to be unfocused and wandering, and Gwen Stacy to be marginalized as a character.Did those critics even see the same movie? The thematic plot was all about Spiderman and Gwen Stacy, in the episodic form of the original creation. One critic claimed that Peter's wry, subtle joke from the first movie, to the effect that the best promises are those you can't keep, was ignored in this movie. This simply missed the point entirely. The drama is consumed with Peter's conflict between his affection for Gwen, and the danger to which he is exposing her. It's actually rather tightly focused. It is also true to one of the major themes of the original, the media controversy over Spiderman's character (hero or villain?) But most of all, the screenplay manages to capture the considerable wit and badinage of the characters as they first appeared in the 60's.Need I add it was visually spectacular? All in all, a really nice achievement.",8,2,8,5 May 2014
Men in Black II," When Will They Ever Learn? [Spoiler Alert]
","The 1997 MIB was a classic character comedy, never mind the special effects. This one has terrific visuals, but Will Smith is out of character from the first 10 seconds. For God's sake, why couldn't they leave `J' the sweet (albeit considerably less naive) guy he was in 1997? Why not bring K back to toughen him up? Work the plot towards the revelation that the Light is K's daughter, the result of his one slip from stern duty, heartbreak at separation, etc.? As it is, it's a string of gags of varying quality, and a totally unlikable smart-ass J.",Null,0,0,3 July 2002
The Da Vinci Code," Disaster
","Spoilers!This picture is a flat out disaster. The plot in the novel was actually laughingly and stupidly convoluted, but masked by the interesting discussion of symbolic meanings in Renaissance art. In the movie, however, this discussion comes across as wooden and even rather silly digressions from the investigation of a homicide.The disaster begins almost from the start. The curator is murdered in the Louvre. While any sensible person would have been saying prayers or writing a coherent note about his killer, this fellow performs more self mutilation and spends his last moments constructing an anagram and puzzle clues for his niece. It sold in the book - it comes across as preposterous as it is in the movie.This is the first time in forever I can remember Tom Hanks dialing in a performance. The delightful Audrey Tatou isn't much better. The script is just awful. The direction isn't much better. The cinematography is very good, but you can see the same thing in a documentary.A dreadful movie",1,34,68,19 May 2006
The Departed," One Negative Vote (Spoilers)
","This movie is sensational 95% of the way through. Di Caprio, whose skills as an actor are grossly underrated, is sensational, Damon is very good, and Jack Nicholson is endurable. (It would be nice to see a movie in which a director actually controls him, as Roman Polanski did in Chinatown. He is over-the-top now in every role, and sometimes it jars as it did here.Unfortunately, the 5 percent that fails is the last 5 percent of the movie. Did any of the critics who are extolling this movie notice that the ending is absolutely incoherent? Let me walk through it.1. Costigan, the Di Caprio character, gives his girl friend an envelope that she is not supposed to open unless something happens to him. This is done with tremendous meaning and significance. It is, however, the last that is heard of the envelope.2. Next, a cd arrives for her with an audio of an incriminating conversation between Sullivan (the Damon character) and Costello (Nicholson). Huh?? If Costigan was going to do this, why did he give her the envelope? And what became of it?Costigan explains that it was Costello's practice always to make tapes of conversations and store them at his lawyer's office. Costigan stole them and made the cd he sent the girlfriend. Huh?? This is the first we have heard of the lawyer, or the office, or the tapes. Why would a gangster do this? More to the point, how did Costigan know of it? None of this is explained. It all develops totally out of the blue in the last ten minutes of the movie.3. Next Costigan lures Sulliavn up to a rooftop, and cuffs him, announcing his intent to arrest him. Huh?? Why didn't he send these incriminating cd's to the DA, or the police chief, or the Boston Globe? If what Costigan wants to do is arrest, why on God's green earth does he not just walk into the police station and show this mountain of evidence to somebody?More than this, Costigan has called to the scene a friend he went to the police academy with, with whom he exchanged a joke or two in one of the earliest scenes, two hours before. Huh?? Why him?? Why not Dignam (Mark Wahlberg's character) or - as mentioned - any regular police officer?4. Costigan gets the cuffs on Sullivan, takes him down in an elevator, and without warning is shot through the head. Now you have to see the whole movie, but this is just script hari-kiri. As much as these Hollywood types like to flaunt their world-weary cynicism, this story requires a heroic ending. For two hours we have suffered along with Costigan, and di Caprio is really good. We do suffer. All of the emotional momentum is in that character's direction. There is an elementary principle of story telling violated here - you don't bump your protagonist off on a whim.5. And boy, is this ever a whim. Costigan's killer turns out to be ANOTHER corrupt cop owned by Costello. Huh???? This movie is premised on the notion that there is ONE police mole, ONE gangster mole, and the two men are trying to find each other. We've been watching that story line unfold for two hours. The existence of a second insider throws doubt on nearly every scene that has gone before. (I am not going to go back and detail that point by point.) The second mole is so tangental that I could not recall him in a single scene before this sudden appearance.I could go on and on, for there are a couple of other twists every bit as bizarre and out of the blue as the ones described. But it is late, and you get the idea. I had the sense that someone on the Scorsese team could not stomach the obvious ending, where Costigan gets some sort of vindication and the girl. Well, that would be old-fashioned, but there are story lines that demand it, and this is one of them. In any case, it would be better than the absurd mish-mash of a climax that completely destroys the value of this movie.",4,8,14,7 October 2006
The Woman in Black," Radcliffe's Performance (Spoilers)
","The Woman in Black turned out to be quite a successful Friday night movie, plotty and quite scary, without being over the top - nothing that the audience will take home with it. Most of the reviews have hit the nail on the head. I am writing only to take issue with that minority of critics who complained about Daniel Radcliffe's performance. In my opinion, he was excellent - conveying the rising states of suspicion and fear in his character's emotional state, without ever lapsing into camp or chewing the carpet. He is on screen for 90 percent of the scenes, maybe more, including an extended set piece in the middle in which he is the sole actor in front of the camera. (That by the way was the spoiler - not much, in my opinion, but I take no chances.)I am a huge admirer of the Harry Potter novels, but not of the movies - beginning with 'Order of the Phoenix', the director and writer didn't even try to match the nuance of the narrative, and they are more a series of staged tableaux than a fair presentation of the novel content. Maybe for that reason, I thought Radcliffe was far better in this part than any of those.",Null,2,5,4 February 2012
Life," The Old Switcheroo (SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!)
","I maybe speaking for myself, but I am getting very, VERY tired of downbeat 'surprise' endings. This movie isn't bad. It's an unapologetic homage to 'Alien', but slightly better scientific background. The actors are good, and credible, but the roles are not challenging. I am writing this review, however, about the ending. As the picture closes, the characters played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson decide the new creature is too dangerous to be allowed even into the atmosphere. So Gyllenhaal, who does not want to return to Earth, decides to lure the being into a pod, and shoot into outer space, while Ferguson will try to find safety on Earth a' la Sandra Bullock in Gravity. All this is with reference to sophisticated guidance systems.So all this takes place, and we see the capsules going in opposite directions. Then - at the end - the earth-bound one is opened - and - GASP!! - HORRIBLE SURPRISE - the wrong one went to Earth!!!! The creature is among us!!!Come on. This is a surprise?? It was old by the time Twilight Zone ended its first run. And never mind that in terms of any engineering logic, plus the competence that members of a space crew would have to demonstrate even to be there, this end is absolutely incredible. Plus it is SOOOOOO predictable. I wish some of these clever guys would take a leaf from Soderburgh's 'Contagion', which showed competent people doing their best, and an ending satisfyingly credible. The actual twist of 'Life' isn't a twist at all, and goes a long way towards damaging the picture fatally.",5,2,5,24 March 2017
