Scarface," The game doesn't change the stakes just get higher.
","This movie set the standard for the ultimate crime syndicate movie.  Tony goes from ashy to nasty to classy, but, crime pays for how long, until you meet your downfall.  Pacino & Bauer gives Oscar caliber performances.  A definite classic that should be in your collection.  If you don't have this movie you shouldn't even be reading this now, you should be in a store buying the movie.",10,0,0,3 August 1999
The Usual Suspects," In this game, who do you trust?
","Possibly the second best crime syndicate movie ever (second to Scarface) to ever grace a movie screen.  The twisted plot, the great acting, i.e. Spacey, and an ending never to be forgotten.  These crooks take on the job of their lives, which they may ultimately pay with their lives.",10,0,1,3 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," The ending makes it all worth it.
","While watching this movie I found myself engrossed in boredom.  I was really ready for the movie to progress, but once I saw the ending I realized the necessity of the drawn out plot.  Now, I am angry that I was so busy wishing it would hurry and not paying attention to the details.  So actually, it wasnt drawn out, it was details being layed before the audience.PAY ATTENTION, then the ending may not be such a shock.",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
