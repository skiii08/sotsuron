Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Quick Summary - Astonishing work, Needs tweaking in script and character development though
","I was fortunate enough to attend the Charity Benefit Premiere of THE PHANTOM MENACE for the San Francisco Boys and Girls club on May 16th 1999. With video cameras everywhere and non-attending fans leaning over the security railing to get a glimpse of what was going on at the Galaxy Theater, I knew I was taking part in something very special.  My instincts proved right when I was able to meet the man himself, George Lucas, as he entered the theater to give his opening speech.  This really got my adrenaline going. (if you happened to watch ET on May 17th then I'm the guy behind George with the red shirt!) I think that's enough of my bragging, I want this review to be concise so you guys won't have to read an essay to get the facts.Although I didn't think it was as good as its hype said it was, Phantom Menace was the most amazing work of motion picture I had ever seen. George Lucas has made the most dazzling production design and SFX I have ever seen! My eyes were popping out the whole time at the beauty of it all, but this visual stimulation distracted me much of the time from anything else.  I do believe George was distracted, since he was embarking on such a visually ambitious project, and forgot to concentrate on character development and story.  Jar Jar Binks is cute in a very annoying way, Anakin Skywalker is a perky little kid (nothing what you would expect him to be) who just seems to be a subplot against all the other political storyline, and the other actors and actresses could have been directed to have more chemistry and emotion in certain parts of the movie.  The story just felt too much like reading a history book at times too. With all those things said, I still give this movie a thumbs up and I'm definitely going to see it again, it just brought out the kid in me! Uh... well I AM 16 but my mentality differs. George Lucas has tested his abilities and now that he knows them, he can concentrate more on the magic of myth for the next two installments. Whoa, this was a long review after all, sorry.",7,0,0,19 May 1999
