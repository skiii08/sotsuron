Catch Me If You Can," Best Spielberg in years
","Now this isn't 'Schindler's List' or 'Close Encounters of the third Kind', fare from those legend movie, but it's the best movie Spielberg made since 'Savin Private Ryan'. Sad because is seems less Spielberg than other films, just like 'Minority Report'. Leonardo is very convincing and this is his best performance yet.His portrait is great and you could see him as that kind of charming fraud he plays. Hanks is less convincing than Leo, but it's still the great performance you'd expect from the best actor we have right now. As in 'The Road to Perdition', it's a new character for Hanks, which in both movies probably led to the Oscar nomination of his co actors.But Christopher Walken is the best, by fare the best performance i've seen him in. He has some sort of devilish greatness about him it's just great. And the scenes with Hanks shows a great portrait of a father, Hanks must have some magic effect on he's co-actors, cuz if Hanks isn't the best all others are. The movie is great stylish, very 60s and very straight. There are funny moments in the movie, especially Agabnale's first prank/fraud.But somehow the movie is a little too long, but leads up the best Spielberg ending since 'Schindler's List'.I love spielberg movies and this is one of his five or six best, which is saying a lot. 8/10",9,0,1,16 March 2003
Gravity," Beautiful, intense and so very simple
","I like simple ideas and even more so if the results are as simple in it's execution. But to get a truly well done minimalistic result a lot of work goes in to it. Sometimes even more than on more complex projects.Gravity is simple. Very simple really. Sure there is a storyline. But there are no twists, no surprising external influences on the course of the story. There is a very limited amount of actors and elements we need to relate to. And there is no protagonist. It is as close as you get to a real life drama. But in it's simplicity it is also extraordinary beautiful. And here it is clear the effort to make it simple is truly complex and monumental. Cuaron is a man known for long shots, swooping camera movements, toying with effects, point of view and other visuals. And it feels like this is what it all leads to. It is perhaps the most beautiful film I have seen in the cinema. It is crisp and truly awesome images we see. Even when everything is chaos and hopelessness sets in the images are beautiful and scary. The effect are just breathtaking.My favourite scene involves an astronaut seemingly disappearing into darkness set against the Milky Way as a background. It is such a powerful images and full of so darkness and light and infinite space. It is a scary and yet awesome.Clooney is great, Ed Harris is comforting and Sandra Bullock is at her best. And that is all there need to be said about the cast. That is all there can be said.The 3rd act does turn into Hollywood film territory as the fight for survival comes to an end. And the turning point is quite clear to me in retrospect. But even during this Cuaron makes the film beautiful and suspenseful. Even if we know the outcome. Almost at the very end the whole cinema literally gasped.Cuaron has made a breathtaking film using his usual tricks and his sense of visuals. I think this is the film of the year so far. Nothing has come close to the impact this film has had. For me and clearly for a lot of other people. And watch it in 3D. It really works.",9,1,2,11 November 2013
Madagascar," Wonderful...!
","A wonderful movie for all ages.This films really follows in the footsteps of recent animated blockbusters as Finding Nemo,Shrek, Monster Inc., The Incredibles, Ice Age etc. The story works very well, and it is obvious that the team behind is people who knows their media. It stays on the same course all the way through, something that really is the essence of the success of the animated films these last years, something other writers can really learn from. And that's all the comparison I will do, because it really is its own movie.A wonderful thing about it is the references to other movies like The Planet of the Apes and American Beauty. Very obvious references I might add. This also means that the filmmakers are aware that a growing number of gross comes from adult audiences as well, and you then have to assume that the story is written for them as well. The style of the movie is like we are use to in normal cartoons, just put into a new media. And it works very well, you're always aware of it, and yet you sit and really is in awe of the texture of for instance Marty(Chris Rock). The technique is definitely as is to be expected. Hanz Zimmer, who's becoming a very well known man within the animated world, does a moderate good job, the music is there and really gives the effects it needs, but is just background. Directing is good, and all the characters works in their own way on the screen but are best together. There's a huge deal of very well timed jokes and they all somehow seems to work.The characters are very amu... sorry, highly amusing. Chris Rock is almost best as voice(like in Dr. Doolittle), where Ben Stiller although he comes through still is more enjoyable as live action. But both of them are easily identified. Jada Pinkett is a bit to anonymous, and David Schwimmer is just great, although his character wins in being a good background joke. Now for the minor characters, as often with these films, the minor characters gets a way with so much attention they deserve a little more attention. The three penguins are awesome, and is the ideal kick starters for this movie. They deliver almost nothing but laughs. The king of the wild Julien(Mr. Ali G) is fun, although without his sidekick Maurice(Cedric) he would be nothing. And then there's the two monkeys also very enjoyable. One minor thing is to me that in seems that the Sabletooth tigers from Ice Age seems to have been copy-pasted into this movie for action, a bit sad but nothing that the movie itself doesn't salvage. I would rank it among the top ten movies of this year, it is very fun and works very well in most ways. 8/10",8,41,67,1 October 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Wonderful skilled directing and incredible film, but missing plot and story.
","I love Harry Potter, and 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is my favourite book. The series has taken a large step in a new direction, from the two first Columbus made films. An understandable choice.What's wonderful about the stories is the way things are introduced as one thing and often turns out to be something else or have a significant role later on. A wonderful thing about the books, and therefor saying 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is the best is not saying that much. But 'Azkaban' has some more important elements of seriousness and it is where, for me, the real story starts, where the fight between good and evil really starts. The two prior stories is an introduction to persons, with Harry and Tom Riddle as the most important. So I had some what high expectations to the film. They where mostly fulfilled, although I found quit a lot of holes. The news of Cuaron as Director had me some concerned, although it didn't scare me off, far from it. But when I heard of his work with Practical Magic on set, I actually found my self looking forward to the film. As always the film has the same magic to it as the books, the locations, sets and magic is fantastic, but by now that shouldn't be a problem for them. Rather what is the problem is story and acting. For once the acting is of a quality seldom seen in family films. Cuaron has made a great job with the young actors, and some of the scenes actually out matches the good old thesps. Incredible to see the actors growth that way, how they evolve into the characters. This is something I really appreciate. It makes this much darker installment of the series more realistic and gives a feel of the story, that to some degree lacked in the two prior. The cast is good and solid, really works out fine, although Gambon as Dumbledore is a hard one to swallow after Harris' take on the role. But the rest is great, and most of all believable in their role, even Thewlis works as Lupin, although it is quit another direction from anything else i've seen him in.Cuaron's feel is in the movie. It is a director movie if anything, the use of cameras and it's movements, symbols and images that is repeated through out the films, long shots rather than fast editing and it work so well, it looks amazing, Prisoner is an example of what you get if a director is taken from the smaller movies where he had artistic liberty to the major films in Hollywood, would love if more films where like that. It is something few still possesses in Hollywood, like David Fincher and others. The long shots with dialog are impressive, and explains quit a large deal of the background of Harry and therefor some plots of the future films. And they again show the work between director and actors. The story is quit a problem, the important stories are as they are in the books, but being a director with his own ideas, Cuaron has changed some smaller parts to fit his vision and the movie, a shame, cuz somethings have a innocence in the book that the movie hasn't, and somethings are much more significant to the story than the film implies. They are the animagus-plot, Snapes connection to Black and co., some of the 'erotic' feelings between the three friends, to soon in my opinion, and the fact that scenes are cut, most likely due to time constrains, fulfilling Trelawney's prophecy.As a fan I know much of the background and plot, but I figure that people who haven't read the books doesn't get the whole picture, a shame, cuz in Prisoner there lies so many things that explains who Harry's parents is and who his parents friends is. Guess they have to read the books then. As a series fan i'm sad that many things are missing, as a movie fan i'm impressed with the treatment of the media, which looks so great it blows me away, as a fan of both I'll give it 9, for the effort and the feel of the film, and because I know i'll be watching it again and again and again.",8,0,1,5 March 2005
Frozen," Lovable Classic Disney Tale with mediocre elements
","I get why it is getting love... not sure why it is getting this much love. The story is nice, the animation is gorgeous, there is the standard comic relief characters (Olaf and Sven are very enjoyable) and there is a message to the whole thing... I hope because it is slightly beyond me what the message is. Face your fears? Love is the answer? Snowmen will melt in the sun? Maybe it was just below me.Either way it is enjoyable and funny film that is entertaining and has a bit of twist to it. Which is all nice. But it is an unimportant film with characters who adults at least should find it hard to related to as there is very little explanation or redeeming qualities to them. And the bad things they end up doing is just brushed off in the end. The songs are abysmal, trivial and really below the standard Disney set in the 90s for animated musicals. For all the things I didn't like about the film I can forgive all except the songs. Had they dropped the songs I could have enjoyed it far more. And it honestly feel like they knew this as the end 20-30 minutes feature no songs whatsoever. Did they just drop them? But this is me as an adult. Kids will love it for sure. All my points in the first part is still relevant. And kids will respond to this. And they might find the songs more appealing than me. And maybe not care too much about the character flaws. So do not avoid the film... just don't expect too much for adults to love about it.",7,2,5,27 February 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Greater and better than the average, but fare from Fellowship
","Now I'll start by saying that for me the second installment of the Lord of the rings trilogy, hasn't meant as much to me as FoTR and RoTK.But two things has meant a lot to me; Gollum and parts of the books we'll see in RoTK, and Boromirs Last Stand.The film is a great epic war movie. And for me thats not good enough. The story is fare from what i remember. The most important scenes in the film are the ones in Helms Deep. Tolkien also lies much weight on these chapters but not as much as PJ & co. The scenes are well made and probably only seen better a few times before. That Massive system really works out great. I have no problem with the battle in helm deep, beside the fact that i think it's too long. And here I wonder. Why is there is teen scenes we never read about in the books, too end the movie five chapters or so before the book. Before that we already knew that one chapter would be cut from TTT, Boromir's Last Stand. Where have the original story gone? Instead they put the elves in the middle of the story, where they don't belong. Why? So we have a more clear love story. For most of the fans I guess we don't need it, and beside, isn't there warm feelings between Aragorn and Eowyn? But wait that isn't the only new scene. Varges? Where do they come from and the result of the fight with the varges doesn't even support any of the important story lines that we have in this film, why should he fall? Well, to make it more hectic and give it more speed and action, yes, but isn't there enough when the Uruk-hai's are killed, when Theoden King is freed from the poison of Isengard and the battle of Helms Deep? And we even get to see some action in a place where Frodo, Sam and Gollum never went. Another new scene, but this is so short and important to clear out what Faramir has to do, this probably was a hard task.There's plenty of action and incredible scenes as in FoTR, and some are betters, much better.The Judgement: This is still one of the best films seen the last year, terrifying at points, beautiful, actionpacked and deep most of the time and remarkable in every scene. But besides the fact the it isn't excatly what the book is telling at some points, it is a great epic journey to a new part of Middle Earth.The designs, the effects, the music everything helps us fall in to the world and feel that this is a historic film, not a fantasy film. I love it, but it lacks magic and suffers under that the makers sees it as a middle part to guide our heroes to their destiny in RoTK, because that is what it is. We see magic places, but not because of beauty and history of the place but because the story takes them there, not as in FoTR, where it all is new and exciting. I hope that in the last installment they have regained the exciting feeling of the project too make a great end to what stil is the best trilogy so fare.
Gollum. Gollum is so perfect, incredible and realistic like no other thing I've seen in movies. Andy Serkis delivers a great performances and defintely is the right choice. He is the movie. I would like to see those deleted scenes with him in the movie and a couple of minutes less battle and new scenes, would have savved the movie.I like the first half and of course Gollum in every scene. It is a great intro to the movie with, Gandalf and the Balrog, and of course our first glimce of Gollum. It is great up to the point the varges attack, and after that in few periodes. The battle of Helms Deep is epic and historic, but too long. And the destruction of Isengard is well done. But to make it one of the last scenes, it doesn't work for me.I still love the movie and I give it 7 out of 10, because of the grandness of the story and the very beautiful images of Middle Earth.",7,0,0,12 January 2003
Hero," Was surprised to find that I liked it.
","I've never seen a Asian movie all the way through before. I actually went to see the incredible visual scenes and the fighting. Had no idea that I would like it as much as I did. It's an incredible visual epic story. And it's nothing like anything out of the US. The story line is not as straight forward as many other films, it takes time to tell the real story. It's a typical fight movie with more deepth and strength in the love scenes than many others of it's type.The Story goes from something like we've seen hundreds of times before. But then it turns out to have alot of twists and turns. Perhaps the story isn't the most original or best written. But what the film lacks in story, it gains in stunning Effects, action, grand visual scenes and the well made distinctive change from storyline to storyline.I loved it and plan to see it again.Like other before me Ill go to the comparison between 'Crouching...' and 'Hero'. First of all the comparison isn't that easy, it's two very different stories. 'Crouching...' is a more personal and less colorfull story about being true to yourself. 'Hero' is a small part of the long history of China, it's more a stunning colorfull film about the choices Heroes make to become Heroes. My Favourite is 'Hero', probbaly because I saw that one first. I've always liked colorfull esthetic settings, and the Fights in their minds are mindblowing. 'Crouching...' is a slower film it takes more time, and even if some of the fight and emotionel scenes are better made, 'Hero' is my Favourite.",10,3,5,23 May 2003
The Da Vinci Code," Solid and entertaining...
","Now I'm one of those people who loves the book mostly for the subject of the mystery.And therefor I simply had to see this movie. So should I make the usual comparison with the book or just review the movie? I always try to make the best of a movie for what it is. And in this case the word 'thriller' usually is attached to the movie... but as I see it this movie is more of an adventure movie... with a more realistic background than Raiders of the Lost Ark and Tombraider... but the story is still a treasure hunt. The character work is not superficial but not that deep either, some efforts have been made to develop our main characters, but nothing big. This is probably an effect of the clearly much discussed storyline. Silas and Bishop Aringarosa is where Dan Brown himself have made most back story to show their common background...unfortunately this doesn't get as much attention as Sophie Neveu and partly Robert Langdon. But all characters are believable... and Ian McKellen is a joy as Leigh Teabing. I for one misses the story line of Silas and Aringarosa and later Captain Fache... there is a lot of good material in this story... Ron Howard has been able to make Silas a tragic villain for sure but Silas's background and why he suddenly is the loyal servant of a bishop doesn't make it... I would love to have seen more of this... and the line 'I'm a ghost' could have been used more as to show this difference between his old violent self and the new 'angel' self. And the last turn of betrayal by Aringarosa and Fache turning his back to Aringarosa does nothing to make Aringarosa seem more human and tragic... he becomes more evil. I can understand why Christian would have something against the movie over the book where he is much more human, they make the church seem much more cold and calculating in the movie.As for story.. it is highly entertaining and well put together. It is actually one of those few movies where we don't end in lose ends. We get a nice closure on most subjects. Akiva Goldsman has been able to write a rather solid script where the important things survives and only useless subjects doesn't make it. we get the story we need, but then again not much more. This is the way a movie work. I feel it is always important to view a book and a movie of the book differently. Some things just needs to be dropped and changed to make it a working movie. And for Da Vinci Code they make it work. The Length of the film is rather long, but I actually forgot it. The pace of the film is not fast but far from slow... we get a lot of information over a short period but the mood of the film is slow, the 'car chase' from the embassy where the music and the fast pictures make huge contrast is a good example and I sat there impressed i stead of one the edge of my seat. It is a slow fast movie, unlike most movies being fast. But with a lot of fast movies a lot happens to fast and we get to much information and at one point one sits and things 'when is the movie over anyway?', in Da Vinci I instead was able to just enjoy the movie! Over all this is a solid movie for what it is, not as a mind changing movie, but a highly entertaining movie with a story line that just seems to make people go nuts. A shame actually, for once some people ought to see a movie with out making it all real! It get a 9 from me!",9,4,8,1 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Pretty good...
","Don't know where to start, cuz if I start the wrong place I'll write a couple of pages, or just end up with a few lines. Mind the holes when speeding! The plot is off course very much like in the novel. The differences is the speed with which we are dragged through the story, and one understands if we keep the lenght of the book in mind. There are few important plot holes, but most are nicely filled in and the story goes along as we remember it. The many holes would be a huge minus if Kloves and Newell, hadn't managed to put all the things together without jeopardizing the storyline, and yet move things around. The speed on the other hand is a huge minus. I was left with the feeling that there had to be more. Going for the throat A huge plus is the acting, I was very positively surprised with the young actors: Dan, Emma, Rupert and co. They have all evolved into good actors. Dan really pulls every aspect of being Harry Potter off brilliantly and Emma proves those who thought she couldn't be Hermione wrong. Brendan Gleeson is crazy and wonderful as ever, Alan Rickman still deserves more screen time, Miranda Richardson is just awful, which in this case is good. The bad acting are found in places one may not expect to find it. Michael Gambon is, by name, a solid actor, yet he fare from pulls of a Dumbledore one will grow to love. He gives some of his lines good, but seems to forget that the body also tells a story. Who has ever seen Dumbledore go for Harry's Throat, literally. Ralph Fiennes is not bad in this picture he is just wrong. He plays Voldemort more as a pompous jerk than the more nonchalant dark lord I imagine him to be. A role I know Fiennes to be great in. The good news Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is where you begin to se the differences between books and films. Not that you couldn't see it in the prior three movies. But now they have learned the universe to know, and know where to cut something and add something. And still it remains a little bit more loyal to the book than Prisoner of Azkaban. If you like me go to the movies to see a movie based on a novel, Goblet of Fire is just wonderful. It is a story set in this universe and it is given information of the background and through the text and image of who people are. Goblet of Fire gives most of the story in words and action, but still remains loyal to the book, by using small informations in the background and the pictures we are shown. They have like in PoA instead of cutting the film into several short scenes in a row, tried to bind everything together through longer scenes. The visual sides takes from PoA and thus have the same gloomy and dark fell to it. The tones are at points almost grey and death, yet the highly coloured world of Rowling gives it life. We see a huge development in the characters. Harry and Hermione are very deep persons with a lot of feelings that are shown in numerous ways. Those two characters are, along with Ron some times, the most interesting characters, and these two roles are very well filled. The best about this movies is that it really works well. We don't sit with the same feeling as PoA could bring: 'but what about...?'. It is more complete and enjoyable for those not familiar with the books I imagine. And even more so for us who knows them.The Bad News Again we see a very pathetic Ron, unaware of others, and what they feel, and that have been turned into a joke, along with his already humorous lines. Right in the middle of the film there are five minutes of sheer laughs, all centering around Ron. This is a shame, especially since Rupert shows in the more sensitive scenes, and more serious scenes that he can handle it. He says it himself: 'just Harry Potters stupid friend' Dumbledore has really become aggressive in his old days, and a bad actor too. I once knew a Dumbledore calm and at ease, he would present himself as calm to the world and still be able to show emotion through actions. But he would never go for Harry Potters throat. He yells and hits, and even goes to become almost depressed at one point. It is what he feels. And you know what? For a guy one and a half century old, he can really move, running and jumping around, reminding one about Yoda. A thing also brought into Voldemort, as great as Voldemort looks, he for me brings images of Darth Mauls into mind, in his way of moving. The ballet-touch is overdone and didn't even fit in to Star Wars in the first place. Why should Voldemort then move like a dancer?8/10I see I started the wrong place!!!",6,0,0,18 November 2005
Any Given Sunday," Straight up good
","I know Oliver Stone is a great director but for me this seems like a strange step from politics into the world of cold finance and sport. None the less, this is one of the best sport movies ever to come out of the US. The big surprise for me in this visual masterpieces, is perhaps the comedian Jamie Foxx, I know him from his show, and heard a few songs, but he surprised with his very convincing acting. I have the feeling this probably is one of a couple of times we'll see him act so convincing but I hope he chooses his other films as well, so we'll see him some more.The best scenes of the film is during the matches when the camera shakes like hell, something i'm sure is borrowed from a Kubrick movie I think it's 'Path of Glory'.8/10",Null,0,1,20 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Great, just Great, but a new editor please!
","It's an epic tale, made into one of the best adventure movies ever, but definatly not the best. Although I knew much of the story was shortened and many characters was lost, I decided to try watching it with as new eyes as possible. This task showed impossible. When you've read the books you know what there is to come and which scenes have been changed and deleted. Besides that fact the movie turned out pretty well, I think. It got some of the feels to as FOTR and the stunning battles of TTT. But it doesn't out rank FOTR, but is slight better than TTT.Here follows Spoilers:
The movie starts out pretty well, a scene that explains the story of Smeagol turning into Gollum. A scene that I felt could have been cut for some of greater importance. It's is of course in to show Smeagols first kill and that he is able to kill. It's in for those who have not read the books. Like TTT the film quickly gets into the right pace. It's fast and is, although many scenes missing, almost as good as I feel TTT is untill The Warge Attack. But ROTK is this good all the way trough. Great effects, pretty convincing settings, great acting, incredible music and a touch of love for the story is shown allthrough the movie. BUT, the film is to fast and jumps very much in stories, much more than TTT, and there's too many flashbacks. The flashbacks are the worst of those things. There are no flashbacks like these in the two former, both here we suddenly have ten. The pace is fast and makes the movie too hectic. But it also makes it exciting and, due to the length, easier to watch.Many scenes have been cut and many things have been changed to make this work. I, as a Ringerfan, misses so many things, but I expect them to be in the EE. Still as a fan, PJ should have cut the films diffently, so ROTK why be slower and many scenes could have been in it. Most of the things cut, is after Cirith Ungol for Frodo and Sam, and after The Battle of Pelennor, for Aragorn and co.But all in all, with Minas Tirith, Dunharrow, Pelennor, Minas Morgul, Cirtih Ungol, the army of death, Shelob, The Witchking, Ghan-bur-ghan and luckily the fact Aragorn shouldn't fight Sauron or The Mouth, made me very pleased, compared to what I feared.A 9 I'll give it, just to be on the safe side, should I see it again and love it. Besides EE should be able to draw it up to 9.",9,0,0,25 December 2003
