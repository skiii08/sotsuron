Casablanca," One of the Greatest For A Reason
","There's so many reasons to like Casablanca, it's almost immeasurable. But I'm going to try.You've got two acting greats in Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, which play their roles so admirably and naturally you'd swear they were born for these parts.You've got Michael Curtiz, who, besides being an filming legend, went overboard in this film. He used, instead of his great actors, the scenes and shots themselves to move the plot along, a person watching wouldn't necessarily need to know the exact happenings of the entire plot to appreciate the scene - he uses diagetic off-screen sounds perfectly, and the frame always gives you the sense of exactly what's going on in a scene instantly, a rare feat in cinema that I may have seen once or twice prior to this.And of course, there's the thematic overview of what's going on in Europe, at the release of this film swamped in the mire of World War II, this film provides an allegory for what the United States was doing up until that point - staying out of it until they were forced to act. The movie makes it look just as noble when Bogart stands up to the Nazis (this time taking place in a music vs. music overpowering scene), then when the United States actually invades Europe on D-Day.Simply excellent.",10,0,2,10 May 2010
Lifeboat," A Buried Hitchcock Gem (Aren't They All?)
","I'm a big fan of John Steinbeck, but I've never heard of this story. I'm also a fan of Hitchcock, and likewise - I had never heard of this hidden gem, so I came into this movie with certain expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised.A very claustrophobic movie, as survivors from a German U-Boat attack are adrift at sea. A somewhat ensemble cast, this movie at equal points feels like Stagecoach and Inherit the Wind. Hitchcock achieves a general feeling of isolation in this movie, as almost every shot is a closeup of someone talking, making the audience feel cut off from the rest of the world the same way the refugees are.Several people from disparate pasts join together, and things are complicated as a German soldier survives his way onto the boat. Racism and ethnocentrism is dealt with beautifully in this movie, as several Americans almost changed their tune as they say the German try and take charge, somewhat successfully. Although when the soldier was shot this movie did border on propaganda (it was 1944... so German's weren't exactly sympathetic figures.) A diamond in the rough of 1940's movies, worth the 96 minute runtime.",8,0,0,8 March 2010
Citizen Kane," Split Down the Middle
","Citizen Kane is a curious study in American film. It's lauded as one of the greatest works of film, ever. Sometimes in the same breath, it's lambasted as a hackneyed story and a waste of a film reel. So what is the real Citizen Kane? Well, in a simple breath, this movie is meant more to be studied than it is to be enjoyed. The film itself is somewhat of a biography of William Randolph Hearst, but takes liberties to make a more interesting story. The story, however, takes a backseat to everything else going on in the film.From the first scene on, it's apparent that this movie is simply different than any other movie of its time. For instance, in the first scene with the boy playing outside, the camera pans back, revealing that it is actually inside of a house. Two characters come into the foreground and are having a conversation while sitting at a dinner table, but the camera still keeps focused on the window outside. The viewer gets to capture everything happening at once, from the parents deep conversation indoors to the child's lighthearted play with his sled Rosebud. All with the choice of the viewer's eye.This is what makes Kane special. That and the revolutionary way to tell a story through flashbacks, which is normal now, but in that day, was, as they would say, 'the bee's knees.' Still, boring plot does knock this film down a peg or two. Still amazing in its own right though.",7,0,1,10 May 2010
The Birth of a Nation," Too Long, Muddled in Controversial Themes
","First of all, I guess this film makes me proud to be a Northerner. It makes sense that D.W. Griffith was born and raised in Kentucky, as his Confederate values surely ring true in this movie.Putting the film in its context I guess makes more sense, the film did come out in 1915 - a time when even women couldn't vote. I just couldn't get over the film justifying the formation of the KKK based on the perceived lack of power of one Southern family. But I digress.The film was interesting enough at least in its techniques, it's the only silent film I've seen that actually gives close-ups of faces and I could actually easily follow the plot of the story. However, the plot did meander, and with a run-time of three hours, I found myself struggling to pay attention.Overall, an okay film but not one I will watch again.",6,3,6,8 February 2010
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Worth Watching, Again and Again
","The year is 1964. Communists are coming in at all sides, America's biggest fear is to succumb to the nuclear bomb and the Soviet Union. So a movie is made, and Stanley Kubrick is at its helm. The result is Dr. Strangelove.A movie about a meglomaniacal general wanting to foster a war, it starts with its dark comedy right off the bat. I found Peter Sellers in all of his various roles in this movie on the top of his game, I was laughing with every line and thinking about every other line. The framing of each scene was also exquisite, I found myself rewatching countless dialog scenes just to take in all the ambiance.The plot itself was a little tough to follow, with its abstract story structure. That being said, the plot itself I think was taking a backseat to all of the thematic structuring of the United States love affair with the atomic bomb and death and destruction.A fantastic movie, worth watching for any history major.",9,4,7,11 May 2010
Fargo," The Coens on Top of Their Game
","For anybody familiar with this directing duo, this movie needs no introduction. Many consider Fargo to be the Coen brother's finest work, and I heartily concur.Even though the movie is entitled Fargo, the entire movie is set in Minnesota, making full use of the goofy Minnesota-slang, adding to the dark comedy. Dialogue is what makes Coen brothers movies so special, so authentic, and this movie is no different.There's the frankness of the police officer 'He was funny looking / In a general way,' or the clever use of punny double talk. 'Oh I think my lunch just came up. No, it's just morning sickness,' as Maggie Gunderson (played so eloquently by Frances McDormand) says after examining a dead corpse with a bullet in her head. But overall, it's the pace and in-depth nature and believability of the world that draws you in and rewards multiple viewings; being able to catch subtle character nuances on subsequent screenings is very fun, especially with Coen Bros. movies.And last but not least, this movie contains two actor-defining roles, as to my mind Steve Buscemi (Carl Showalter) and William H. Macy (Jerry Lundegaard) have never done finer work than they did whilst filming Fargo.",10,0,0,10 May 2010
The Graduate," As Awkward as Hitting Puberty
","Wow, the sixties were an interesting time period. You've got the counter-culture Easy Riders on one end, and sweeping cougar trend starting with The Graduate.Mike Nichols knew what he wanted in this movie, and to sum it up in one word, it would be awkwardness. The camera's sense of space and character's sense of space during the entire movie was jarring and sometimes very uncomfortable to watch, but that's what Nichols was striving for, I think. You have Ben Braddock (played admirably by Dustin Hoffman) just graduating from college, and like so many other listless 20-somethings of that era, had no idea what he wanted. Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) of course had plans of her own.While mothers preying on young awkward men is nothing new nowadays, at the time this movie came out it was landmark and debaucherous all at the same time. Likewise, this movie was anchored by a haunting tailored soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel, and some of their best songs were written specifically for this film. Tracks like 'Scarborough Fair' and 'Sounds of Silence' add to the awkward coming of age in the movie, feeling comforted and uneasy at the same time.All in all, definitely a movie worth watching, if not for its racy content, then certainly for some of the best cinematography of the era.",9,1,1,28 April 2010
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino in His Prime
","A film for most modern movie fans that needs no introduction. Quentin Tarantino's ode to the 50s noir mystery and about a dozen other film genres, but that's Tarantino's bread and butter.You've got excellent performances from Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, and Uma Thurman, just to name a few. You've got hilarious dialog (Why can't you just hit the guy?) and an abstract story structure that will most likely have you confused til the very end. Not to mention samurai swords and a gimp! What's so great about Tarantino movies is that they very much resemble modern art. What I mean by that is you watch them, and you're never entirely sure what you're watching, but by the film's end, you're left with a sense of completion and totality that you rarely get in any other cinematic experience. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You can thank me later.",10,1,2,11 May 2010
