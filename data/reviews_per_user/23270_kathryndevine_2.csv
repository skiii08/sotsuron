Hereditary," Utterly pitiful
","Not just the worst horror I've ever seen but possibly one of the worst films in any genre. Completely ludicrous. It did provide a few laugh out loud moments, but l assume they were unintentional. I have only given one star because it doesn't seem to allow you to give zero.",1,2,6,11 January 2019
Yesterday," Predictable and cliched
","Including lots of Beatles classics in a film isn't enough to paper over the cracks of a wafer thin, ludicrous plot and a predictable, sappy love story.",2,4,12,9 July 2019
