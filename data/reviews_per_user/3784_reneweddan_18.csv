Source Code," Unexpected cinematic perfection
","Source Code is the first and only film I've seen on the big screen this year, mainly since I've been waiting until the summer to indulge.Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan team-up to give a performance you wouldn't believe.The show is well-written, futuristic, and nearly flawless. If you're a fan of either actors mentioned above, you'll simply love this film, and if you aren't, you soon will be.Source Code didn't focus on profit, it focused on quality and the audience, something that seems to be uncommon practice even this very day.Give this film a chance, you'll be beyond thankful you did.",10,3,5,30 May 2011
Erin Brockovich," Law School? At this point I'd settle for Charm School
","Julia Roberts and Albert Finney pair up for a dynamic duo as they take on a case from scratch and build it into a David vs Goliath situation.This movie is inspiring from start to finish. It's based on a true story and shows that life can get from worse to better for anyone.The acting is fantastic, the script is moving, and the dialogue is intriguing. This is the type of film you could re-watch any time you want because their are many different interesting factors that will always keep this film fresh.It's hard to refrain from using Wikipedia throughout the film as there are many factually important statements throughout, but that just proves how amazing this film is.Watch this movie, you'll enjoy it even if you dislike courtroom dramas since very little is spent in a courtroom. It'll keep you interested, motivated, and inspired.",10,1,2,2 October 2010
Lords of Dogtown," Enjoy it with an open mind
","I am not a fan of surfing or skateboarding (although learning to surf is on my bucket list), but I decided to watch this film due to some of the names on the cast list such as Emile Hirsch, Heath Ledger, and a small appearance by Jeremy Renner. (Heath Ledger... what talent!)The film begins as a surfing movie, then transitions into skateboarding, but the execution is amazing. I hardly watch movies without checking the time left, due to my incessant need to know everything, yet I didn't feel inclined to do so during this film. What that means is that the film has a perfect flow, it will keep you interested throughout the entire film.It's a fictionalized film of 'The Z-Boys' and how they revolutionized the sport of skateboarding. The film has much to do with skateboarding, but the main scenes are coming-of-age related and it really shows the simplicity of life that we take advantage of. There's many things you can take from this film: from fame, fortune, and success to humbleness, health, and friendship.I thought this film would be a somewhat decent, but I was so wrong, it is an inspirational and interesting piece of art. I highly recommend this film if you have an open mind. If you aren't moved by the end, then you aren't human.",10,11,14,16 October 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Mutants never get old
","I am a huge fan of the X-Men movies that have come out recently, hopefully more will as well.The main reason I highly enjoyed this film is because I grew up watching X-Men the animated series, but I was too young to fully understand the details. This film had me using Wiki a few times just to confirm whether or not the event was exclusively in the film or if he was also in the comics.I found this film highly entertaining, but maybe those who knew more about the comics found it a bit repetitive or somewhat disappointing, but that wasn't the case for me.I find this film to be underrated, although as one reviewer put it, I would've enjoyed seeing more Gambit.",10,1,4,28 September 2010
The Day After Tomorrow," Better than the credit people give this
","This film is visually sensational and the acting is decent except some extremities but in a situation as the one depicted in this film, you'd expect extreme behavior.Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal do as well as you'd expect, they've never let me down. They could make or break this film, and to be they made it.The story is much more than 'father tries to rescue the world and his son', it's about the compassion in others, our abuse of natural resources, learning from our mistakes, and our political stance in the world.This is a very humbling film with great visuals and a story so extreme it can't be completely impossible.If you want an easy to down 2 hours, get this film and watch it, just be sure to get it in the best quality possible, you won't be disappointed.",10,2,3,2 October 2010
Ocean's Twelve," Ocean's Twelve, sub-par to Eleven, but great for what it is
","Sure, this movie wasn't as good as the prequel, but it is great for what it is... a comedic heist film with the best cast ever.This movie lives up to the star power shown in Ocean's Eleven, but it has a different twist of humour. Those who are heavily criticizing this film should relax, it's not meant to be a film that deserves high praise, but it shouldn't be under scrutiny for being what it is... a feel-good film.What I highly enjoy about the Ocean's Trilogy is being able to watch a film that brings together great talent, some of the biggest names of my own generation, and watching them in a comedic heist film that deserves some popcorn and laughs.This movie is highly underrated, not because of how great the storyline is, but because of how great the entire package is.Enjoy it for what it is.",10,8,12,26 September 2010
Ocean's Thirteen," Ocean's Thirteen is perfection for the perfect trilogy
","Great film, great acting, great script.I believe this trilogy has been the best trilogy I've seen yet. The first Oceans throws you into the trilogy, immersing you into a storyline vastly superior to many. The second Oceans is a step down from the first, but it is great for what it is, a heist film, which focuses more on the heist than the gambling. The third Oceans is a great finish, it leaves you wanting more, but sadly, with the death of Barnie Mac in real life, the possibility would be in a way... disrespectful.The third does not let down.Most trilogies would've had this play out as all three heists, but the interesting thing is that every movie has a different plot altogether, not focused on heists as much as the storyline about the heists. I love this trilogy, the star power, and the brilliance.Cheers",10,1,2,26 September 2010
Cast Away," Because tomorrow the sun will rise and who knows what the tide could bring?
","If you haven't seen this film, you are missing out on something extraordinary.The direction of this film could've been any, but the precise way it was directed strung some chords for me, watching it was sensational. Rather than messages it could've given, the message it gave was like none other, this is one unique piece of art.Everything in this film is well done, especially the acting, Tom Hanks scores again. Wilson was a great actor as well (hah), I've never felt so emotional over something like Wilson.Cast Away isn't only about survival, it's about so much more, and it's truly inspirational.If you haven't seen this film because of whatever reason (especially because it's a bit long) then you need to rethink your decision. Every minute of this film is enjoyable and patience is a virtue that really pays off.Enjoy this film because Tom Hanks put his sweat and blood into this one, and it clearly paid off.",10,2,3,3 October 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A film like never before
","This film is entirely ingenious, brilliant, and captivating. It is enticing and enjoyable, completely out of the ordinary and a refreshing change to the entertainment industry.Every actor in this film excels, they immerse you in the realism of such a surreal film, alongside the amazing direction and special effects. The added annotations/captions are creative and the storyline is completely out of this world.Although the storyline might seem straightforward, the way the film plays out and the change of scenes are so captivating, you'll be amazed, astonished, and yearning for more.If you don't enjoy this film, I don't know what you would enjoy. This film is on-par with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang for me, both of which were refreshing and creative, with comedy both small and large. This film is more of a video game, which in itself might seem lame, but the blending of a film-like video game is astonishing.Enjoy this film, it's definitely worth watching for years to come, just try and find ways to enjoy it, such as Friday night with friends and popcorn.",10,1,9,28 October 2010
Peaceful Warrior," Philosophy and entertainment
","Although many have preconceived notions about Victor Salva, I believe this film is brilliant, a person's criminal past shouldn't dictate how well they produce a film.Scott Mechlowicz and Nick Nolte perform incredibly, I just wish Scott Mechlowicz starred in more films, he is talented.This film follows the journey of the famous athlete Dan Millman. It's set in University and depicts the early years of his life. Although it should not be mistaken for a true story, it's based on true events, which is very different.This film will inspire you to strive, thrive, and prosper. Although some parts might seem somewhat cliché, it's beautifully done and the best things in life will always seem cliché since we spend more time dreaming than we do living. I'm pretty sure there isn't a success story we haven't heard, it all begins with working hard, but this film is so much more, it's deep.Enjoy this film for what it is, not what you want it to be, it's thought-provoking and inspirational.",10,2,5,15 October 2010
Avatar," Avatar!
","The last thing this artistic film needs is another review, but I can't contain the excitement I felt after viewing it.I know, I'm a year late, but with that aside, I can see why the hype has been so great with this film. The artwork is one thing to boast about, its main strength, but the acting is amazing as well.Sam Worthington does wonders, great, great decision to cast him as the lead. You can't help but sympathize for him and feel connected to him. Zoe Saldana also does well, those two made the film! Michelle Rodriguez is probably my favorite alternative character in this film, but needless to say, everyone excelled.This film can be enjoyable for the artwork, the creativity, the ingenious storyline, the uniqueness, the amazing acting, and so much more.One of my all-time favorite films, yes I believe the art made this film what it is, but that shouldn't take away from how complete of a package this film truly is.Well done! Most profitable film, financially and creatively!",10,1,7,9 October 2010
Invictus," I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.
","Invictus is an inspiring film, based on a novel, and the novel being based on Nelson Mandela's legendary presence in South Africa.Clint Eastwood... Matt Damon... Morgan Freeman... what talent! You also see Scott Eastwood quite often. The acting is great, but the main power of this film is the story.The film isn't as tedious as one might assume, it actually flows quite well. Although this film doesn't have a heavily climatic plot, the laid-back approach allowed the main focus to be the greatness of the story rather than the need for excessive drama.Enjoy this film, it's both inspirational and enjoyable.The name Invictus comes from the poem written by William Ernest Henley, which inspired Nelson Mandela in the worst of his times.Beauty through and through.",10,1,2,10 October 2010
The Terminal," Loosely based on the story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri... very loosely
","Although some claim it is based on a true story, it's very loosely based on the story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri. The only similarity is the fact that the airport forced them to live in a terminal for an unprecedented amount of time. Wikipedia the biography of Mehran Karimi Nasseri if you want more information.Back to The Terminal. This film was great, every minute is something different and the outcome always unpredictable. You have a love/hate relationship with the enemy during most of the film.This film is definitely worth watching, it's the type of film you could watch over and over during a certain period of time since the story is unique and the events are creative.Tom Hanks did very well acting and portraying his character. Sadly this film doesn't get the attention it deserves. There is a reason why there are two love stories, and the events don't have to be predictable in order for it to be a great film.Watch it! Enjoy it and take it for what it is.(If you're wondering why an airport would allow someone to live in a terminal, read information on Mehran Karimi Nasseri. It will not spoil the film since this film is very, very loosely based on his life. To my amazement, it was longer than I'd ever expect legally possible.)",10,0,2,7 October 2010
The Blind Side," The Blind Side took me by surprise
","This HAS to be my all-time favorite film.I have seen hundreds and hundreds of films in the last few months (due to my lack of other priorities at the moment) and I must say, this is the most moving film and most worth-while.From beginning to end the acting is SUPERB and the story never turns dull, never.I was hesitant to view this film, it was on my list of movies to watch, and Sandra Bullock has always been a great actor, but football movies are sometimes a hit and miss for me. This movie was therefore, the biggest surprise. I was expecting much less because the ending is already known and the plot seems to tell it all.BUT I WAS SO WRONG! This movie has emotional and amazing written all over it.If you do not see another film in your life after one more, make it this one. This film deserves more than 10 stars.",10,1,3,24 September 2010
X-Men: First Class," Strong enough to stand alone
","The concept of this film might be somewhat mundane to some since we already know what happens in the future, but this shouldn't stop you from experiencing the best X-Men film of the franchise.James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Kevin Bacon act so well that I'm still astonished as I write this review. The rest of the cast members were solid, but these three stood out far beyond my expectations, which were high to begin with.Although there might be some mythological errors in terms of the comics being adapted to the big screen, it's definitely something that can easily be over-looked.The CGI, dialogue, action, acting, and script were in perfect unison.There really isn't much more you could ask for from this film, except another one just like it to keep the X-Men franchise as strong as it can and should be.",10,2,5,3 June 2011
RED," Red is brilliant!!!
","I never thought much of this film prior to viewing it, as many others might not have either, but if you have even the slightest inclination to view this, you must! The story is typical, nothing special about the basic plot synopsis, but the delivery and the interesting plot twists keeps it fresh and interesting. The humour is hilarious, mostly a subtle humour that is apparent throughout the entire film, in nearly every scene.Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, and Karl Urban all excel, as would be expected. It is refreshing watching Bruce Willis star in another action film, alongside Mary-Louise Parker (the gorgeous mother in Weeds) no less. John Malkovich plays the paranoid role quite astonishingly and Helen Mirren firing large weapons, including a gatling gun, is amazing! Every name above plays an equal part in the film, which is amazing. I never had so many characters in a single movie that I highly enjoyed equally. Remarkably done with talent seeping through the actors and vividly portrayed on the screen. Don't expect this film to change the history of all films, but expect it to exceed in entertainment. If you give it a chance, you won't be disappointed. It's definitely a Friday night flick, something that is easily enjoyed.Brilliance!",10,149,221,15 October 2010
The Truman Show," Brilliantly done
","Not much more I can say about this film, there are many great reviews.This film is thought-provoking and has many moral and lifelong messages within it.This film is a drama, not much of a comedy although many parts are quirky and amusing. The script is creative and the entire film is ingenious.Jim Carey does extremely well, as does Laura Linney.Expect to be moved by this film, as well as amused. You will enjoy this film through and through, although it is a bit short, it's kept concise and creative, never letting you down, not even for a second.",10,1,2,3 October 2010
Easy A," Typical plot with an atypical greatness
","This film was my first pick after taking a month and a half off watching movies and it definitely exceeded my expectations.I believe in rating films for what they are and how well they exceed the standard granted the plot and actors are taken into account. I must say, this film is/was a great watch from start to finish. It has a unique way of enticing the audience when similar films couldn't, although it does have a very fresh aspect in many respects.Don't miss this films, it's definitely one of the good ones of 2010 (there are many great films this year). I am glad they chose the actors and storyline the way they did.10/10 stars for being able to captivate.",10,0,0,16 December 2010
