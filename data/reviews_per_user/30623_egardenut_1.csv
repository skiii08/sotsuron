Black Swan," 'The Red Shoes' meets 'Repulsion'
","'Black Swan' is an extremely perceptive and chilling expose of the world of classical dance. Ballet is an art form that is as ruthless as it is breathtaking, and Aronofsky does an excellent job of portraying that dichotomy. Nina's (Natalie Portman) descent into madness is on par with Catherine Deneuve's portrayal of Carole in Roman Polanski's 1965 classic 'Repulsion', albeit with modern (read graphic)scenes. The audience was gasping at certain scenes. Although they were 'imaginary', they were able to convey such an immediate sense of horror and revulsion that the audience was totally captivated and drawn into Nina's world. Even the end leaves you wondering if, once again, Nina's madness is manifesting itself. What is scarier - that Nina is gone after one 'perfect' performance, or if she will be continuing on in her (and her mother's) obsession? On another note, Mila Kunis' performance (as Lily)demonstrates her range beyond comedy. A beautiful and natural actress,her casting was perfect! Be prepared for the extremely visceral nature of this film when you go to see it.",10,10,18,4 December 2010
