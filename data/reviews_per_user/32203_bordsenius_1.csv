Come and See," An extravaganza of cinematographical pain, suffering, sorrow and violence - with no graphical violence. An exhuberant experience.
","This is a film like no others.  It is horrible. Violent. Gruesome. It might make you vomit. It made me sick for  week, but I still think that it is the best movie I have ever seen. There is no graphical violence - all is in the head of the viewer.Humankind is given a big slap in the face  - this is more real than reality.So my advice is - go and see. It will not leave you untouched.My personal 'best movie ever' prize goes to this one. I still shudder when I think about it, and It has been about 15 years since I saw it.",10,10,14,7 July 2001
