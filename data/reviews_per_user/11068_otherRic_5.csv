The Rock," One of the worst movies ever
",I love to bring up this movie in casual conversation. Someone says 'That was a pretty good movie' but after I point out 2 or 3 things they usually admit that it not a good movie in any way.The plot has holes big enough to drive a Mack truck through - soldiers who died in a declared war had their deaths covered up? Why? Everyone in the world knew here they were and what they were doing.A man is kept in prison for 30 years with no charges and no convictions and no one notices? A dozen men can steal a dozen weapons of mass destruction (including missiles) in 10 minutes with dart guns? SEALs can't figure out how to open a locked door?You get the idea. I can't get through 3 minutes of this movie without shaking my head in disgust.,1,5,21,25 June 2004
Spider-Man 2," An all-around excellent experience
","What a triumph for everyone who has been complaining that 'no one has done a comic book movie right'! Spiderman 2 does it right - the action is better and better paced, the human elements are more complex and gripping, and the plot addresses Big Ideas without getting distracted from being a movie. The effects are great, the writing is solid, and the acting is also great. Molina is in fine form as Dock Ock, MacGuire has Peter/Spidey down pat, and the rest of the cast is as good as one could hope. I just hope that Spidey is as successful and long-lived as the James Bond franchise",10,0,0,6 July 2004
X-Men," Great adaptation
","The flat best adaptation of a comic to the big screen ever. While I expected great action and good fights, I was very pleased to see they kept the big issues (mutants as metaphors for any oppressed minority, laws driven by fear rather than justice, etc.) and the character conflicts (not everybody gets along) from the comics. If you want a summer movie with great action *and* a plot, then see X-Men.",9,0,0,14 July 2000
Armageddon," The only thing worse than the acting is the science
","Truly painful to watch, this movie had the dialog of a cheap 1930's serial and the plot of a Tom Swift novel. Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler are terrible, Bruce Willis seems to have phoned in his performance, and the character actors, all talented, are wasted.And the science is flawed; yes, only a portion of the sky is routinely scanned. But a chunk of rock that big would be visible beyond the orbit of Pluto. And to approach as it did, it must be close to the ecliptic, meaning it was in the portion of space watched most closely.I enjoy science fiction and I enjoy action. But this movie was so bad my willing suspension of disbelief got up and went to get a drink!",2,1,2,25 June 2004
1941," Spielberg taps into the roots of movie comedy
","I have always considered '1941' to be a misunderstood masterpiece. Stevie tapped into the madcap comedies of the 1930's and captured that amazing frenetic energy wonderfully. The inter-cut, naturally delivered but wholly contrived dialog is pure Howard Hawks while the sight gags, non requiters, and puns seem like the Marx Brothers. We have mistaken identity (a few times!), a dangerously-crazy villain, a humorously crazy hero, the local schlub turned hero, epic quests that are ultimately meaningless, and befuddled fathers.OK, its not 'Bringing Up Baby' (which was considered a terrible bomb in its own day), but it carries on the same traditions. Watch 'Duck Soup', 'Bringing Up Baby', and 'Sons of the Desert', then watch '1941' with that same outlook.",9,3,7,16 September 2005
