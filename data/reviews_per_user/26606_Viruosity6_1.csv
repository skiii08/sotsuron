50 First Dates," A Romantic Comedy that's sensitive and poignant
","This is one of the most beautiful and touching romantic comedies I've ever seen. It has lots of humor and romance; however, it is also touching and poignant, especially in the scenes where Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore, one of my favorite actresses, learns AND LEARNS what happened to her and how her father, brother and friends at the restaurant deal with her condition. I really admire how it was made a comedy and yet there was no fun or sport made out of Lucy's condition; that part was handled with care and sensitivity. I get teary-eyed every time I watch this movie. My father and I recently watched it and even he was getting choked. And this is one of Adam Sandler's (who plays Henry Roth) better performances, there are only a couple scenes where he acts like a complete idiot. But the way that he handles Lucy's condition is so tender and loving.",10,1,2,21 January 2005
