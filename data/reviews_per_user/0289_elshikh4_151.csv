The Avengers," Fun summer blockbuster, Full Stop !
","I know that the one Billion Dollar and a half income causes dizziness, even for me! But who said that the highest-grossing movies of all times should be the best movies ever made?!No doubt that Marvel Studios has done it, with the right ambition, order and budget. In 5 years plan, the release of 5 movies; The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and a calculated connection between all of them; they made a good foreword for this dramatic climax, which turned into a financial climax for Marvel itself, their plan, and the superhero movie in general. But, was it that good?!It's good as a huge sci-fi action. Joss Whedon's love for the Marvel world did marvel! As a scriptwriter / director, he interweaved the heroes' story lines well, filled the movie with the ultimate action he could get, and made fair time on screen. Actually, the movie is made of fun.Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron man stole the show, not merely because his power as an actor, but originally because his star-power which guaranteed him the bigger role, the best one-liners, and the heroic situation at the climax. Captain America was the weakest in powers amongst the rest, but that was compensated finely by making him the planner wise brain of the bunch.I loved the formula of hot action always followed by funny one-liner. What I loved more was writing a motive for the movie's evil guy. Loki's speech about wanting desperately to be a king did satisfy something I used, since my childhood, to not see it satisfied in 99, 999 % of the American action movies!The visual / sonic extravaganza was well-made. All the explosions, sound effects, etc.. dazzled perfectly. However, what merits the real praise should be the editing. Kudos to the editors of this movie, they managed brilliantly to cut the material reasonably and enjoyably. The movie didn't turn into crazy hurly-burly at any time. That's a big victory to be proud of, putting in mind the majority of the action flicks we get from Hollywood lately.And the cameo of Stan Lee is welcomed as ever. For one reason he's funny and ironically used, and for another it's loyal and honorary to have him around. Age lengthened with the 90 year old Marvel Comics writer to witness his creation as movies, and yet be part of it too.But, on the other hand, certain characters weren't up to the rest, and yes, I mean Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye. They could have been fit for another movie instead (a regular spy movie for the first). Still the shot in which the camera rolls around all The Avengers while the end's fight makes me laugh, especially when I see Natasha holding her little gun as if a peer to the superpowers and super dangers around her!!The plot permits some bugging questions to be asked. For instance; what was Loki's plan while being on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier? He didn't use the Hulk's anger as he intended to do! The problem of the Hulk wasn't clearly explored. I couldn't understand what was the matter of 'the point is, I'm always angry'!! And why he got blindly furious on the carrier, then 'Hello', he's fighting for the good side at the end!? Loki's army wasn't that threatening, only some bizarre enough goons to be killed later without any particularity. The way Dr. Erik Selvig and Hawkeye awake of Loki's charm is truly laughable (just a good hit on the head!!).Pace-wise, I thought that between the end of the second act (Loki's escape from S.H.I.E.L.D) and the start of the third act (Loki's attack on New York City) there was something missing; like some events were rushed. Yet, the main shortcoming has to be the matter of lacking the inner motives. I know that Earth is at risk, and Agent Phil Coulson is killed, but the lead characters didn't have personal issues to overstep, which didn't add any 'dramatic deepness' to the mix.This is Marvell's promised ritzy festival, and it works, gathering all the audiences of the previous 5 movies, and the readers of the original comics behind them. I love it as fun summer blockbuster, with no thoughts allowed. I even long for part 2 and 3. But, to tell you the truth, while movies like Avatar, Titanic, The Avengers, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2, and Transformers: Dark of the Moon are on the top of the highest-grossing movies of all time right now, I long to the day where not a 'summer blockbuster' will join the list, and - why not - be its number 1. I believe that someday the people will get enough of the summer blockbusters, and go on a pilgrimage to something else, something more serious and less flawed, something that talks to the mind and the heart, more than the ear and the eye. Ahh, when will the ordinary people become better than the superheroes?!",7,0,3,8 January 2013
Angels & Demons," Such a boring comedy !
","This is a thriller? No. This 'was' a thriller, because by the way it was handled; it turned into a comedy. Look how things run: Tom Hanks alludes to a statue, knits his brows, then uncovers the whereabouts of the next murder, and maybe the killer's shoe size too! To tell you the truth, I believed that his character can look at your ears, and know what the last things you've heard were! Well, this is provocative. And with repeating it, for more than 10 times along the way, then it is more provocative. And with adding so serious music, running camera, and snappy cutting; it becomes perfectly a comedy. Originally, if the criminal is so smart, why in God's name he leaves all of these clues for Hanks to discover?? Why doing it the old-fashioned way?? The answer: so author Dan Brown finds a material to write, and movie star Hanks finds a movie to star!The dialogue is overcrowded with the most sophisticated information ever said by an actor in a mainstream Hollywood movie since Star Wars! It made me laugh, especially when the writers went to apportion the information on Hanks and his partner to throw them as quickly as they could, so nobody would understand anything! Then, that female partner. Firstly, WHY THERE MUST BE A FEMALE PARTNER??! Secondly, she happens to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING!!! At first, I presumed that she has knowledge in terms of the atom technology, but OH MY GOD, she proved later that she was a scientist in arts, history, code breaking, security, forensic medicine and unlocking the closed desks!!The science fiction of finding the origin of creation was shown as a laughable mambo Jambo. There is a bomb threat, however a million men and women is determined on staying in the very threatened place to know the name of the new pope?? The character of the relentless hired killer is totally copied from the first movie, he's just talking good English this time! The Vatican papal foundation behaves at the end like an Italian mafia family?!! Hanks character acts flawlessly, as if he's Superman without the costumes and the fear of kryptonite as well! I bet that you thought for all the time how Hanks was in the wrong place; simply he's a fine actor, and according to the no character that he plays, you have to feel awful irony, since he does nothing but running and running and running (he didn't have any comic one-liner either!). Why he wasn't written as say a claustrophobic guy; that could have made the closed library scene more interesting, and made the character a bit vulnerable for God's sake! And ladies and gentleman, the genius plot twist was too clear from the first minute; so who they were kidding??! I saw the truth about Ewan McGregor's character coming from 7000 miles away, otherwise why to cast a star for that character?!The only respectable 'thriller' part remains in the last 10 minutes; not for the scene where we watch the first Camerlengo James Bond, but for not having any statue that speaks to Hanks! So according to what really works in this movie; it is a comedy, yet the laughs were far in between, therefore it lost the pace; which labels any comedy as boring, and hence bad. Now, after seeing the 2 installments, if you ask me which is better; (The Da Vinci Code) or (Angels & Demons)?, I must go for (Plan 9 from Outer Space)!",4,1,2,16 March 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Who Killed (Kill Bill) ?!
","'Holes like the ones in the moon!'(The Bride) enters a big hotel, where (Bill) stays, with obvious sword; and nobody demurs at that?! She goes to kill (Madsen) with the help of a sword? How naive! At least he's not like O-Ren and her crazy 88 who don't believe in guns! How a respectable professional killer like (Madsen) became that miserable poor person? The script didn't bother itself making him an addict or something!, or why he offered the option to (The Bride) between eye spray or battery, since he would bury her both ways?, and really how could he live this have-not life while he already owns a legendary sword that equals millions???!!! The answer might be: it's emotionally valuable to him, but I think the more right answer is: this is written by the same man who directed it, so no one got to ask questions like that in the middle!'The monk, the fish, and Superman!'It has some of the most stupid dialogues ever written for a movie. The thing to provoke is when you suddenly find the movie wear the wisdom's sackcloth, speaking in sick elaborately about things that seem out of the whole thing or too silly like the kind of the snake that killed (Madsen) and in full details, the monk that began a massacre in the year of 1003, and the memorable lecture about (Superman) which is so judicious and also inserted when it relates itself to the story. Even the good tale of the fish and the kid, who has the killer's seed inside of her, was done so tastelessly. Actually these stuffs beg to be spoofed. In any case, I know that I enjoyed them as comic moments!'Kill The Audience!'(David Carradine) was so ludicrous while playing his flute, as if he's presenting himself: 'Hey, I'm David Carradine, you may remember me from the 1972 classic TV series 'Kung Fu!'. He seems a 100 year old, so how did he manage to be a father for this child?! Moreover, I think his age was the reason why there wasn't any fair fight at the end, which reminds me; this movie sufferers from one bad rhythmic disorder whereas there is a big battle at the end of its first half, then nothing like it later. As an action movie, it didn't deliver here, so forget about any thrill, and when you watch a long movie, in 2 volumes, about a hot revenge story on a guy named (Bill), to get at its end that (Bill), and to kill him as simple as that; then this is disappointing for the movie-goers that (Tarantino) supposedly knows best!'What was that?!'Maybe (Tarantino) used the most popular theme in all the world's B-movies: the revenge, to pay a homage, ANOTHER homage, to the cinemas that he loves, through the characters of the killers: the blaxploitation (Vivica A. Fox), the far Eastern action cinema (Lucy Liu), the western (Michael Madsen), and perhaps the European violent movies (Daryl Hannah). It would've been kind of attractive if he really made it this way. As with easy pretending writing, the story was mere yet stark flat, and all the characters, so their events, seemed hanging in the air (read: Tarantino's poor hallucination). He built the nonsense world in a nonsensical way as well, concentrating mainly on certain sequences or nostalgic details (for him!), more than the big picture, degrading the personality of his movie, and achieving a heavy emptiness!As an album for B movies, this volume isn't creative but lazy and sleazy. And as a whole, it lacks originality in a way that made some say how (Tarantino) is a copycat! For me, it's one of the worst as alleged more than done. So, it ended up as not a good B movie or a good homage.It mirrors BADLY how he's a conceited moviemaker, making a long boring idiot trivial movie (the rest of the attributes is in my review about Vol. 1), believing that it's the opposite. You can sense his vainglory as well as delusion through touches like: mentioning at the closing credits that the character of (The Bride) is written by Q & U; meaning (Quentin Tarantino) and (Uma Thurman)!!, his description of (The Bride)'s massacre as 'legendary'!, plus some irritating publicity like (The Fourth Movie By Quentin Tarantino!!) while no one ever used that with more honored, better, directors.(Tarantino) already killed his own movie, creating something not good on artistic or entertaining levels, delivering us a complete waste of time, which works only as a nasty caprice for its maker.'Someday, they'll see the light!'Although it's not a groundbreaking, it's a breakdown, but you'll have countless dull ones who'll tell you: 'Yes, it's bad, but being bad was the point'!!!!!!!, so it's good in being bad????? If you love it as it is; fine, nobody can control their heart, but arguing in this way is the dumbest, most manipulative, ever which turns any bad into great! It is fool work, and with all the hype around it, it's super fool. Someday, someone will get out of their deep sleep, to say what a lousy bunkum that is!'Name good thing about it?'Well, there are 4. The action choreography, the solid sequence of the mentor; with the character itself so all the Hong Kong zoom-ins, the pretty smiling child who played Bill's daughter, and seeing (Lucy Liu) without scalp; I've never thought that I would thank (Tarantino) for anything!",4,8,14,29 March 2009
The Legend of Bagger Vance," How Junuh Got His Swing Back !
","Ahhh, it's not about golf. It's about knowing what you want in life and learning how to get it through golf. And it's about making not that interesting movie about all of that as well!It sums up life, and reads people, with deep lessons, via one golf tournament. See the players; one is prurient (the oldest one) who cares only for money, women, and fame. Another one (middling-aged) who cares about winning, yet family and work too. And then our lead (the youngest) who considers the game a fully spiritual ride. As if the spirit's power proportions inversely with ageing; so as long as you're more spiritual - meaning less caring about materialistic goals - as long as you're young, and consequently live longer. Not to mention other matters that perfect with the main theme, like how life / golf is a match to beat your own weakness; ego, pains, etc. So you can find your swing; meaning your peace, where your gift / the best of you; meets its top shape, hence success. Sure they're all bright points. But not brightly delivered!The small problems: First off, WAW, that must have been the longest heart attack anybody had in the history of mankind, and I'm referring to the one which struck Jack Lemon's character while he narrates the whole 120 minutes movie! Despite portraying it nicely, few people know about golf and its rules, and the movie just didn't help much to explain for the ignorant ones. And the music, ohh I hated that music, it's the typical soft music of Hollywood movies lately, so typical to have eventually nothing to it, being more like usual sound effects!Then the BIG ones: it's undoubtedly Matt 'The Flat Face' Demon. The guy is lower than his character, its demons, and its inner conflict, while having so little to express. His boyish sleek features just chilled the supposed fires inside. He's too cold to be silently torn. Likely actor / director (Robert Redford) wanted to cast himself in the role, or at least he saw himself in it. The role resembles some of his distinct characters over the years already. But with that suppressed desire, and that unqualified star, what we did have was the very poor man's Robert Redford as a lead!The movie goes exactly like this: Demon plays bad, then Smith comes to straighten the guy with some cool sophisticated talk about balls and life, learning him how to get jiggy with it.. urrr.. get his swing back. Well, he gave Demon so many advices to an extent that put The Iliad's verses to shame!Will Smith looked so idiot, and it's not his fault. He's way too young to have all of this complete wisdom. Casting Lemon instead should have been more believable. Even if the point was to indicate metaphorically how the WASP is indebted for the Afro-American, it didn't work. Especially when poor Smith got nothing to do but smiling quietly and saying fortune cookies all the way.Then, nothing was said about who that young impeccable mentor was? Where did he come from? Or what would he gain out of his plan?, nothing said about the real calamity of the lead either; his war's bad memories, plus the mute Demon who they relayed on to speak the unspeakable. Add all of that to the previous, and you'll find that the movie is whether a parody of itself; about a black dude named Vance who shows suddenly for the bad golfers to rectify their performance for just 5 bucks (or accompany them to death free of charge!), or - at best - a dream of a lesson about getting the pureness of oneself yet imperfectly made.Apparently, it tries to be wise and outwardly rich to end up as alleged and inwardly needy. The smooth cinematography and the romantic editing made nice colors to a hollow painting. While the movie appeals us to finding the 'swing', it loses its.Correct these flaws and you'll have the magical movie that this one wanted to be. Dear Redford, look at Smith's smile getting more and more empty and provocative as the movie goes on, to know that (Legend of Bagger Vance) missed a lot of care to be a legend, any legend, itself.",4,4,8,13 October 2010
Alien 3," A Thought-Provoking Slasher ?! Think Not !
","The first Alien was horror with some ideas about the human vs. the unknown. The second Alien was action / horror with no ideas but making everything as very big and very hot. Now the third Alien tries to mix the first with the second to lose the best of both!Here's an excellent ground for one of a kind genre movie. A prison of only-men criminals, who became mostly religiously fanatic. After a long time in which they didn't meet a woman, and decided to refuse the whole female race, they meet Ripley, and more than that; they have to 'join' her to terminate the new-hybrid Alien. Undoubtedly, it has a dramatic and metaphoric potential. It could have been unprecedented woman-movie about an educated one being trapped in ignorant whole-masculine society / prison that despises her, so how about their developed common necessity to be both hand-in-hand to destroy one danger. It could evoke too the human vs. the animalistic sides' conflict, with the woman as the sole rational soul amongst a world of barbaric men. But Alas for that or else.Everything sounds chop-off. Nothing is complete. At one moment, the doctor; a sympathetic with the heroine and a possible lover for her, dies while telling the story of his guilt (??). The head of criminals / nut priest befriends with the heroine pretty fast; so what was the meaning of the hate as a drama, or pure thrill?! Yes, the matter of Ripley being pregnant with Alien's Junior was wild and surprising, but I couldn't get to understand how it happened. The movie doesn't disappoint the intellectual core, whatever it might have been, that promises of only, it even harms the attempt of ordinary viewing for a solid Hollywood fare.Speaking about the 'fare' side, David Fincher, who came from the music videos and TV commercials, doesn't offer much in his debut as a cinema director. The movie is too dark for its own good sometimes. The action isn't so dazzling, I don't know how to do that right after what James Cameron did in the second (explosive is the word!). And as a horror, you know that you've seen better.The one fulfilled and complete good idea in this movie was the matter of having no guns or weapons. That was so ambitious and creative. On one side, it gives the instant question 'How they're going to face the monster?', and, on the other, it gives the opportunity to watch different kinds of improvised weapons. Other than that, nothing was really 'going on'!The thing is the movie suffered a long-term of rewriting, re-shooting and reediting (over a year was spent in the editing process apart). That's why many points looked eventually strange or incomplete. Though, I believe it was a fine cinematic exercise for Fincher in making movies, and in dealing with the Hollywood masters, read: the producers, who can play with any movie in any way they want. His born as a master director himself would be postponed till (Seven - 1995) and (Fight Club - 1999). Therefore, see him revenges, or says what he originally wanted to say, in (Alien³: The Assembly Cut), released on DVD in 2003.I totally ignore the debate around 'Was Bishop II human or android?', because seriously, it's nonsense. What would be gained out of that, since the whole thing ended up as another slasher movie yet set in the space, with many important points left incomplete!P.S: In 1992, the movie's star and executive producer, Sigourney Weaver, said: 'I am sure there will be Alien 4, it just won't have me in it.' Nevertheless, she did (Alien 4: Resurrection - 1997). Maybe to make more money? Or maybe.. to apologize for this sequel!",6,0,0,18 October 2011
Mission: Impossible III," Finally, (Alias: The Movie) !
","So this is the third movie already based on one of the most errant TV shows in the movies' world. I believe it has nothing to do with the previous 2 movies. The first one was Brian DePalma' spy piece where the hero was framed, the good old Jim of the original series was a traitorous, and there were couple of action scenes. The second one was John Woo's action bomb where he got to explode everything and anything in our faces, for the sake of making absurd Bond out of, yes, Tom Cruise! Now, it's J.J. Abrams's Alias. And it has the best of the past 2 movies, and nearly none of their problems.It was a smart move when they brought Abrams to write and direct. The distinct thing about Abrams's work back in his famous TV show Alias (2001-2006) is his brilliant combination of sci-fi, action, thrill, espionage and the saturated dramatic lines as well. He mixed Bond, Mission: Impossible, with the old classic soap operas all in one. Here, with Alias's writing buddies Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, he did what he does best. I loved that he was the first to handle the franchise, and be that loyal to the too memorable music tracks that Lalo Schifrin wrote for the original TV show; it's like 'This is dedicated to the TV series' lovers'.It's breathless and twisty, but with few weak points. Don't ask where the English girl, that Cruise lived such a *mythical* love story with in part 2, had gone! As this is a whole new ballgame. And I won't make game of it, because Cruise here loved the one that deserved the marriage. What did bother was elsewhere.It's Bond more than anything. True that the 'team' is more present this time, however as nearly ghosts. At one moment, we'd be about knowing them; and I mean the scene in the car about the prayer of the lost cat. But sorry. Cruise, or Abrams, had to interrupt with big matters. The matters that bring the money! Though, this is the most MI movie to date. The entire movie is shot in close-ups; the old TV habits die hard I suppose. It lacks some dazzling long shots to intense the cinematic feel, so people would go to watch something else what they watch in 24.Then, the movie's top problem: The third act. It's not related to the quality, the coherence, or the strength of the first 2 acts. From the moment of capturing Cruise in China, till the happy end; I wasn't happy at all. It's close to the final acts that ruined fine movies before. For instance: Why the CIA's disloyal agent is that craving to know what was in the message of Cruise's murdered agent?!, why all the trouble to make a mask for Cruise's wife, put it on someone's else face, then BANG?!, and most of all: Where is the climax?!After loud pretty action sequences, we land on a very pale disappointing climax? I think Abrams knows well that after charismatic missions like freeing Cruise's apprentice, kidnapping the arm dealer, stealing the rabbit foot--it's rejected to finish shortly with something that doesn't top or equal its prior. It takes only the head's bomb, which's a very easy way to get rid of THE BAD GUYS! How to fight powerful enemies by machine guns, helicopters and other more sophisticated stuff, in lands, skies and tunnels, then beat them all in just 2 minutes in a room by fistfight and one bullet?!! This is what uneven, deficient, and unsatisfied is all about. And I suspect that this was the reason why the box office's profit wasn't spectacular!The roller-coaster pace was ideal for this kind of fares. Yes, dear Tommy is short, close to idiot, and unbelievable as action lead, but here you have absolutely NO TIME to complain about that, or remember it much (thus there is no slow-mo, nor doves, this round as well!). There are some classic moments: the delaying of the phony voice of the disguised Cruise in the bathroom. Giving the CIA 'We're Family' song as the cherry over the tart of Cruise's escaping. 'It's complicated' which is a wicked funny line; it can really summarize Abrams's winning formula in writing when it comes to Alias and Lost. And the rabbit foot, as the thing that everybody wants and doesn't reveal its reality, was a nice sneer from the movie-makers at themselves, because nobody actually cares about this stuff, just the action around it, otherwise the writers have had it with creating similar stuff for every episode of Alias, so leaving it unnamed seemed like a good idea!It is Alias: The Movie. Not merely by many references through the start; with home party, sending for the agent by false phone call, the secret meeting in a supermarket, and even the cameo of Greg Grunberg 'Alias's Weiss'!, as we still have: A raw agent, a man this time, who clashes with the superiors. A mole in the intelligence. A genius stumbling cute technician (British this time). An agent who hides his real identity on his dearest ones. Playing 'around the world in 80 seconds' and getting away with it! The tension between love and work. And the insisting on building a family as the sole balance that saves any human being.I pitied Alias's team, when would it be for them to have their movie??? Maybe after 30 years as the original Mission: Impossible TV show had been treated! But anyhow, some of Alias's spirit finally had been immortalized in a movie. They should put MI3 with Alias's DVD package as bonus!",7,0,4,19 August 2009
Requiem for a Dream," Hype is Bad !
","It's a one feverish 100-minutes-long video clip. I wanted to say effective too, and it is in a way, but I won't. And that's why I'm writing about it now. Yes, the artistic points worked, Clint Mansell's music was fabulous, and the acting - especially from (Ellen Burstyn)'s side - was truthful to creepy extent, but all of that was in a bad hype.The problem is that it deals with the addiction's lust - whether of drugs or TV - with lust as well. The pace of the movie, 2000 shots, the horizontal extension of the event, the complete collapse of all the characters' fates, and the absence of any positive type as well-made the whole thing as a catastrophic tragedy maybe as painful as the addiction itself!I don't promote for a happy ending, or making a dream out of it. In fact, I find that the movie's own end is a real happy one compared to it. It just needed deep analysis for the reasons, not a volcano of results as we saw. Otherwise, it's only a study for the hell of images and sounds that an addict lives. Or, at worst, it's the longest, most exhausting, public service announcement against addiction. Both ways, the very substance became so strained and worn out.In (Requiem for a Dream), dealing with important matter, and a social issue, as a horror movie was the real horrific thing. Hence, does it effect? Yes, but as one feverish 100-minutes-long video clip, not a movie. Simply with the hype, anything meaningful runs weak. So how about being with weak drama too?! In short, it hates drugs while looking like being on one!",Null,1,2,14 February 2010
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Can I Love THIS ?!
","I love (Ewan McGregor), but I hated him as the great (Obi-Wan Kenobi). I love (Natalie Portman), but I hated her as (Padmé), and for sure as everybody's worst joke (Queen Amidala)! I loved the idea of knowing what was the story behind (Darth Vader), but I hated - as the whole universe - (Jake Lloyd)'s performance!I hate CGI, so what do you think my opinion would be about a complete movie that had been done immoderately and stupidly by it?! I loved some of the hot race and the sword-fighting, but I hated the rest. I loved once (George Lucas), so the second of the old star wars' movies, but sorry.. I hated him here as a producer, director, and - oh my God - writer!I hated how it has a boring chatter after another, with tons of political gibberish, and not enough action. In a word, why didn't you bring anyone to write with you Mr. (Lucas), or instead of you?!!! You know what? I loved the trailers of the movie more than the real deal itself. So I hated also that huge propaganda for what it turned out to be an overblown, CGI orgy, bad Star Wars movie.So, as you see, the truth is that I can't love such a movie. And it's all (Lucas)'s fault. He was the menace which turned the beauty of Star Wars into phantom.P.S: The tagline of that movie was 'One truth, one hate', so go figure!",Null,2,6,1 March 2008
Sucker Punch," Punch Drunk !
","I have to begin by something Zack Snyder, the writer / director of Sucker Punch, said about this very movie: 'A while ago, I had written a script for myself, and there was a sequence in it, that made me think: How can I make a film that can have action sequences in it, that aren't limited by the physical realities that normal people are limited by, but still have the story make sense so it's not a thing like Ultraviolet or something like that?!'OK, for starters this is not a bad movie. It's one about oppression, getting freedom, and knowing yourself while it, however, told by a different way that mixes dreams, with music video style, added to action. Seems cool. And it's cool indeed in a way. Though the ultimate outcome is weak, due to some reasons.Firstly, the action sequences. They're imaginative and frantic, yes, but without the most important element that any action needs, which is the creditability. We all know, pretty well, that they're illusions in the heroine's head, as alternative expressions for other happenings, so the viewer's interplay with them is dead. Not to mention, that they suspend their main happenings as well. Simply, they seem like segments from another movie, that this one uses to interrupt itself. So how about their fact as dreams within another dream within reality?! Apparently, this is a case of a movie that encumbers itself by itself, to force some action anyway!Secondly, the confusion. That mix of many dreams within another dream within reality-does bother, especially when you know by heart that the action dreams are unnecessary and stand in front the story's flow. That eventually formed a weird and exhausting plot of dramatically dead action, within interrupted illusionary thriller, within absent real another thriller! Let alone that it assembles many unanswered questions, like what was the equal of the heroine's dances in reality? Or how a murder, like the one that cook did, was kept secret?! Sure something tells you if the action sequences have been collected, and had any in-between, they would have made better movie. And if that one itself had a twist at its end, concerning being a dream of a girl who hates her reality or re-pictures it, then it would have been even better, like other twisty movies lately. Thus, writing it the way it is, lost many advantages, and created enough problems.Thirdly, the characterization. If you want to do a movie about precious values, and not another brainless action, then you have to have well-made characters. But sorrowfully, this script didn't. All what we had was something like: pretty girl who can plan super smartly, and has such a highly cultured imagination (where did that come from?!). A girl who's worried about her sister. Then, that girl's sister. And so on! So, accordingly, what did you add to make your movie totally else 'a thing like Ultraviolet', Mr. Snyder?!Fourthly, why the movie treated its heroine, Emily Browning, as a Babydoll from the start? I know that turning her face, by heavy make-up, into a doll's face is something understood as long as takes place inside the limits of that casino / brothel. But since the first scenes, of the lead character in her home, the movie shows her the same way that brothel does, and - strangely - she pictures herself later with the same image in her own dreamy battles! So, what was the point?! In my most objective states, I'll say that maybe while the movie sees that some girls are born as already dolls, it uncovers that they can think, plan, and choose the moral choice. Still, something was uneasy about showing the heroine, rather all the girly cast, as dolls, for the entire time; as if it's ALL a wet dream in the brain of the movie's manly makers!On the positive side, the performance was sane, and somehow convincing. Browning proves how charismatic she is, how intense she can be, and how expressive she can sing. The fantastic battles were dazzlingly designed, with fresh imagination; it had an Asian legend with giant samurais, a WW2 with zombie Nazis, a middle age European combat with mother dragon, and a Vietnam war with fighting robots. The used songs on the soundtrack were really selective, and creatively arranged. They enhanced the sad sense, and made the movie overall special. The cinematography, along with the editing, did a wonderful job. However, the fault was in a deeper level, putting the whole movie in a cleft stick.Zack Snyder isn't God's gift to writing scripts. And I'm certain that it eats you how he squeezed 82 million dollar, from Warner Bros., to produce this pet project of his. Because, in the end, Sucker Punch should be named Punch Drunk. It resorts to sophisticated narrative, fabricates expensive loud and unrelated-to-anything action, and does some mistakes, all not for the sake of telling its story, just making it superficially different. So, true that the movie ends up as a tale with a new taste, and a rare chance to watch something else the brainless action made by this insane amount of money, but weaker than many brainless action movies, since these movies sound - in comparison - more solid and thrilling, less alleged and mixed up.In a word, Snyder loves the action, hates doing it brainlessly, yet here he failed to write his dream of action with brain, moreover, offered a classic wrong way to do it!",4,1,3,14 February 2013
The Longest Yard," The Disease That Will Eat Up Hollywood !
","I don't hate this movie. I just can't love it!What's my problem with it? It's simple. It's the same disease that I encounter many times lately in numerous Hollywood movies. And to know a disease, you must define first its symptoms.It's a remake, so why to lose time searching for new ideas?! And more than this, I've seen it 3 times before already: 2 times from America (The Longest Yard - 1974), (Stir Crazy - 1980). And one more time from England (Mean Machine - 2001).I waited this time for different and witty material, but there was no respectable effort done; maybe the idea of the rubbery bomb to cool off the prisoners. Some dialogues have been re-used, exactly as they were, again and again from the first movie. The characters weren't real humans to be involved with, or droll cartoon to be interested in. So, generally, I didn't run into something smart or moving, special or memorable.The first half is the best where the odd characters of the prisoners are shown with a certain characteristic for each one, and a variant reason to hate a certain guard. The second half, the match, got noting solid or more comic. And the end's thrilling scene was forced and idiot.The main problem though is that when the movie wanted to make comedy, it depended wholly on: penis jokes, feces jokes, butt jokes, sodomy jokes, and naked old woman; no, not jokes, but literally naked old woman; which was the most pathetic and disgusting try to make comedy, before being the most pathetic and disgusting moment here (I was about to puke!). And you know what the worst of all of that is? IT'S SO EASY!Add to this, Burt Reynolds died since nearly 10 years before this movie was made. I don't know how did they wake up his ghost like this?! Chris Rock is just UNFUNNY, NOT FUNNY, or NONE-FUNNY. Ok, I want to write it by all the known languages on earth! Adam Sandler is in somehow strange land, I thought that they should have hired Bruce Willis instead, otherwise I didn't see clearly why to bring a comic star to undertake un-comic mission, with big physical job as well!I bet you have guessed by now that the disease that hit this movie, and will eat up Hollywood, is called the easy writing. And if you haven't, re-read the aforementioned, starting with 'It's a remake'! Simply with this story, there are endless enjoyable treatments (comical, satirical, musical,.. etc). This is the dumb, little sick, and predictable one. But originally it's another commodity that has to be in market, in time, anyway. Thus it's justified as a natural flaw of swollen industry that wants money, money, money and more money with, or without, making any entertainment along the way. So, it's rapidly written, rapidly shown, and rapidly forgotten too!I liked: Only some moments for that director. The fact that this movie didn't get to use one fart joke (Strange! It's in the manual?!). And, make no mistake, the chance finally to see Chris Rock getting killed in a movie. I'm not that violent to have fun out of that in itself, but it should be fun whenever Rock's violent presence and comedy wouldn't continue till the end of a movie!",Null,0,0,31 December 2009
Deja Vu," Amusing, if You Forgot Logic !
","It's undoubtedly a pretty movie. In rare time, Tony displays the sane, more mature, side of him. I think that he released his passion for rotating the camera through the Snow White program's shots, so the rest was smart, sedate, and not showy. In a word, artsy more than technical. Actually the problem isn't with the directing here. It's surely with that script.It's the good guy, the girl, the bad guy, the chase, the climax, and the happy ending. However, in such a different creative plot this round. The imagination is so wild; there is a mystery to be solved, a criminal to be caught, a crime to be stopped, and a love story to be complete, all by time travel; it deserves the 9 years that scriptwriters (Bill Marsilii) and (Terry Rossio) sacrificed to finish writing it. I adore the time travel movies. The factor is magical and brilliant. Few managed to be as magical and brilliant. Here, it's magical, but not too brilliant I suppose.It was so capable of showing all what it has through a unique thrilling way. The parallel storylines in the past and in the present worked well. But it's slightly in the characters, then more deeply in the logic of its imagination, and seriously in the whole - really weird - third act.I have no idea why this cop loved this girl that much. And I knew nothing about the girl but she's an angel. And I don't know would he love, or re-love, her after the ending? I laugh right now, simply because these are silly questions that are not supposed to be asked in this entertaining movie; as much as it was really entertaining. You'd have hundreds of the movie's fans to answer them for you with an indignant look up their faces. So these things were appropriate in their own world, and that's why it's the slight matter.But when it comes to the Snow White program, I have to disagree. Despite that the main idea was wonderful, it wasn't built nicely. I couldn't buy nearly all what was said about 'finding it accidentally', 'the 4,5 days', etc. If 10 billions were spent for sending a small paper into the past, then what was the cost of sending a 'man'? And who paid? As much as I loved the moment in which the girl sees the light beam of the future (originally surprising indeed), as much as I refused it later; since naturally you have to ask how in God's name she didn't see the light reflections of these guys' hand watches, glasses, buttons, and screens ever before??!! Let alone that it's hard to get all of that in a movie that looks realistic from the start, and didn't have wholly any sci-fi factor but this. So how about the irony of having too wild imagination and a bit reckless dealing as well?!Speaking about reckless, I hated the third act which was a major plot hole. Whereas how the lead, who wrote to himself 'u can save her' on the refrigerator and caused all of the bloody cotton, didn't manage to save her or else before? I mean the man, in the present, watched carefully what he already lived (the past / his future) although the girl died and the ferry exploded?? How while the ambulance hit the home before the blowup of both, the results were negative; since according to that itself, the lead saved the girl already and there is no case to investigate about in the first place! See how this movie, by this third act, shoots itself in the head!I don't believe this was played like that for the sake of matching the title of (Déjà vu). There must have been a first try where the lead did go to the past then failed. Review the moment in which his cell phone was ringing while looking at the body bags. Simply it was his phone, and it was his body in the bag indicating, after the whole watching, that he went back in time already and failed. But maybe the production wasn't able to afford shooting that first attempt, in despite of how it would have cleared up so many things and made the movie more coherent and less wrong. Maybe they thought that the movie would be so long to be tolerable. Or maybe they relied on the 'ramified ways of the universe', with unsuccessful then successful tries (that we get to see or don't!), however in this case it's left for us to do the hard math, and collect too many missing pieces!The ending was just a die-hard happy ending. I laughed a lot with the lead alive anew, having the girl alive too. This time, I laughed for longer time that lasted after the movie was gone. That what happens when the movie makers keep themselves busy with making a happy ending, more than paying attention to trivial matters like mind and thinking!But it's Hollywood. And this is a blockbuster. With (Scott), (Bruckheimer), and (Washington). Namely millions to be paid for millions - hopefully more - to be collected later. So don't mind being mindless totally there, or partly here. Because nowadays the major plot holes became a Hollywood tradition. Accordingly, don't talk about being forced or illogical, since in these movies the forced becomes very logical for carrying out the holy status in which the viewer goes out of the theater fully satisfied. Nonetheless, after this movie, I was satisfied, but not fully. I can't shut my brain down to this degree!(Déjà vu) is relatively disappointing if you thought about it. Highly disappointing if you waited for amazing love story through time travel. Amusing if you didn't do this or that.",Null,1,5,26 February 2010
Casablanca," Falling in Love With a Movie !
","OK, there are some movies that you love nearly every bit of them. Back to the Future, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, The Guns of Navarone, Annie Hall are few from my list. Casablanca maybe comes before all. It is pretty hard to say what's great in it, but anyway, let me elaborate from my heart on that.'A franc for your thoughts'I love humming birds, the taste of Mulukhiyah, the winter afternoon, seeing Marilyn Monroe and this movie. There is Ingrid Bergman loving Humphrey Bogart while the music of 'You Must Remember This' is on, so who needs more?!'It seems that destiny is taking a hand'It is my only time, yet, to watch one movie for more than 20 times (consecutively). Since the first meeting, February 1998, I'm crazy in love. I recorded the dialogue on a tape to listen to it for endless times, making a parody for maybe all the scenes, and writing about it as my favorite movie ever in the acceptance exam of the high cinema institute. Simply this movie made me ask myself how they did it?, pushing me to study how they 'do' it.'Round up the usual suspects'Here the formula magically worked. The drama, the actors and the music; everything and everyone clicked perfectly. The 10 out of 10 is being given to nearly all the elements. This is about to be the utopia of movies.I think that the cinema was so ahead of its time in this movie. For instance, the camera just moves in unusual ways for the early 1940s. I didn't feel any 40s, meaning the worst of the time or even its usual stuff.What a story with complicated: global situation, love story, and moral choice. You have to love the way all the characters pilgrimage to their noble truths at the very end. The way Rick Blaine, the anti-hero, becomes a hero. The way Captain Renault saves him as well. And the way they, Rick and Renault, find friendship in the last time, place and people.Btw, that *twisted* end was made during the shooting, to harmonize with the new political circumstance (Pearl Harbor). That could have turned it into loud naive patriotism, luckily it hadn't!'What an amusing little fellow'Rick is the man. Playing chess with himself, refusing the tune that tortures him, being the model slaughtered lover for the 20th century. He looks indifferent towards the tense circumstances. But basically he's an ideal romantic guy, who was shocked when knew that love couldn't be that ideal, personally and generally, in real life; so he acted as a stone, fighting for nothing, suppressing his heart to give him agony all the way. Though, lastly, his unspoken self-moralities end the situation philanthropically even if that meant more personal agony for him, to not represent the beauty of unexpected sacrifice inasmuch as alive yet hidden ideal man inside any of us. Remember too that we don't love Rick because he preferred the welfare over his happiness only, we love him because he tricked all the parties during the road to that as well!I can't forget the way Bogart throws his love's crying letter off the train, the way he sets smashed at the night of seeing Ilsa after many years, or the way he makes the 'hellabeans' speech at the end. He was the prince of sadness on Casablanca's throne, the original Mr. exiled in the movies, and the guy who chooses Not to win the girl in the end. Bogart as Blaine, or Blaine as Bogart, is so-ugly-yet-so-noble-he's-more-charming-than-prince-charming. And if you looked up the source of this equation, then you've just found it!'I came here for the water!'This is a dialogue to be taught, with so serene comedy; it comes in certain places to lighten smartly the hard atmosphere. I adore many clever lines and strangely I don't get board despite how many times I rehear them: 'I'm shocked, shocked to find that there was gambling in here/ Your winnings sir / Thank you very much!'.'Play it'It got one perfect music score. And the song, ohh; with the warm voice of Dooley Wilson it sums up the story of every movie and rather every life: 'Well, it's still the same old story. A fight for love and glory. A case of do or die. The world will always welcome lovers as time goes by'.'Here's looking at you, kid'I adore the 'He just a lucky guy' situation & double-meaning remark. I know that my tears go while the last 10 minutes, not because the lead leaves his love, NO, but because the rebirth of heroism inside of him, and the pretty solidness at portraying that cinematically in such immortal thrilling moments. Plus the last shot, in which Rick and Renault walk among the stars; this is one of the best endings ever.'A lot of water under the bridge'My friends used to hate me for talking about it non-stop, though, surprisingly, they loved it when saw it. It got me not seeing movies for nearly 8 months after I first watched it, according to hypnotizing feel it caused and one real stunned question it gave: 'Is there any movie better than this?!!'. I hated only Paul Henreid's dryness, the fact that Bogart was shorter than Bergman so they had to hide that all the time, and the way anyone looks at this as ordinary movie. If only every movie tried to have something from it.'Does it got a wild finish?'Though I've loved a lot, but I think I've never loved a movie like I loved Casablanca. It makes the dream so true.",10,1,2,26 October 2009
In Bruges," A movie about Hit-men, purgation, and the contemporary western civilization !
","Every once in a blue moon, we get a genre movie with meaning. And it's even rarer to have it in equilibrium; namely where the genre doesn't exceed the meaning, or vice versa. (In Bruges) is one of those movies. Nevertheless, the balance was partly, just partly, missed.The best about this movie was how it managed to be multidimensional. Outwardly, it's crime / black comedy. It has not 'many of' but nearly 'all' the right stuff: unique characters, with several antics. Hot ping pong dialogue. Engaging European backgrounds. Touchy, even if short, music. Sharp-witted pace. And all perfect performances; surprisingly (Colin Farrell) uncovers how creatively comedic he can be! It's impossible to pinpoint one downside in this cast's work. So, it provides entertainment, in its own dark taste.Then, inwardly, it's thought-provoking with philosophical dimension. The haunting guilt is cleverly portrayed. I loved the matter of 'whether jail or death was my fate, I would welcome any of them', all for ending the compunction, and achieving the purgation. And although death is all over the story, it emphasizes the importance of life and love, because with them maybe we may win penance, second chance, and some happiness.Notice well the names of the characters. They can be read metaphorically. For instance, Ray is a hit-man who did wrong yet has a 'beam' of conscience. Ken, meaning 'perceive' or 'view', suits the character as more experienced than his fellow Ray. The punisher is named Harry; which means 'attack' or 'oblige'. And finally there is a hope in the future, through the pregnant hotel owner; whose name is Marry, maybe as a reference to the Virgin Mary, who'll give birth to a new Christ, to guide and forgive the sinners.Not only this, the movie has some sort of deep and wicked social / political point of view. It shows a western world of decadence. The Irish, the American, the Belgium people are presented as killers, drug addicts, drug dealers, gun dealers, prostitutes, thieves, racist, depressed or suicidal lost souls. The survivors of all that are the priest, and the little boy. However, they're not completely survivors, because they were killed earlier. So here we are, facing a community of human filth, that murdered its spiritual side (the priest), along with its innocence (the little boy), devoting itself to finish itself later, unless there is a desire to purge (Bruges and purge are similar words, aren't they?!). You may consider it another *Noir* world, but aside from meditative reading for the characters, you can't miss the unmistakable irony between the tranquil solemn antiquities (the old civilization), and the boisterous destructive leads (today's civilization), as the grandfathers built the great high towers, and the grandsons just fall over them!Cut to the missing balance issue; and I mean nothing but the movie's last 10 minutes. After the moment of (Ralph Fiennes) getting out of the tower, with his gun, it's all downhill from there. Look how logic takes a dive and sinks: How the man, who always sticks to his principles, betrays those principles stupidly? He said earlier that he won't shoot his target in front of 3000 Belgium citizens. Now he's with a gun, running after his target, shooting him non-stop, all over Bruges's streets, in front of 4000 Belgium citizens!!! Obviously, it was a desire that scriptwriter / director (Martin McDonagh) had of filming a crazy action sequence a la Hollywood. Or maybe, the movie needed that to be sold, since shootouts look good in any trailer of a movie, especially this 'no action, all talk' movie!The one-eyed thief, who was half-blinded by (Farrell), runs into (Fiennes), who arrived to kill the same (Farrell), in the gun dealer's home accidentally, and in the same night that thief sees (Fiennes) getting into the tower accidentally, then sees (Farrell) near the same place, also accidentally (?) That was simply forced! Then, the midget wears as a little boy, stands right beside (Farrell) while he's being killed, takes a bullet in his head so his features may not be clear, so Mr. I-stick-to-my-principles shoots himself for killing a kid-all of that was tooooo forced to say the least! It surely weakened the solid movie, making its end no solid at all.Various bothering points : a line said by (Farrell)'s character, while his anger in the restaurant; 'He pauses, even though he should just hit the '...', and he repeats: Yes, I am talking to you. What's '...' unbelievable?!!' which was unbelievably intellectual for that character to say, fitting more the mentality of an author, or an actor, or an author who wanted to express his own character through an actor ! Add to that, naturally, the lasting waterfall of the F words, the blasphemy, and some obnoxious violence; these were points to hate, more than to bother, to tell you the truth!(In Bruges) is a genre movie that goes beyond the entertainment of its genre. But exaggerating the portion of entertainment, at the end, harmed it. Hence, it ends up as a movie about Hit-men, purgation, and the contemporary western civilization, however with chaotic made-up ending. At any case, Hurray for that 'script'. If you watch many movies, you have to appreciate it, since it is not frequent to run into something like it, very.",8,0,2,20 September 2012
Se7en," Love and Fear.. Who Killed Whom ?!!
","I know, all of the previous comments told you all. But I want to say something of my own.This great thriller will live longer than its likes, for a lot of reasons. The one that I want to talk about is the strong focusing on the characterization firstly in this script. Because this is something really rare in any of the American thrillers nowadays.Here, you have 2 point of views that come from 2 different generations, or simply 2 kinds of human beings.The first is (David Mills), played by (Brad Pitt), who is so rash, tense, running mostly after his sensations, and always relies on the photos, the shape of things. But despite his true zeal, courage, and idealism he is so unwise, very impetuous, and can easily hurt or lose himself. He is too weak to wait justice, so he goes and gets it by his hand, because he is a slave for his excitability.. his emotionality.The other one (William Somerset), played by (Morgan Freeman) is an earlier generation, who has all the goodness and rationality. He is discreet and cold proficient expert, who relies on the books. This one is not perfect either. He is too feeble to stand love, its pain, responsibilities, or loss. So there is no joyful thing about his life, nor lasting thing in it!Both of them make together one perfect unit; so they succeed in pursuit the killer. But HEY, it's not (Lethal Weapon). So you'll have them both at variance, too contradictory, and the only clear medial between them is the first's wife. Therefore, when she died, and (Mills) killed the killer; the borderline already ended, and there was no medial anymore. So separation became the fate.They are 2 very irreconcilable ways, persons, or feelings: the love which kills the fear; so (Mills) lost his life. And the love which is killed by fear; so (Somerset) is losing his own. And as for (John Doe), played by (Kevin Spacey), the limit went to extremes; so he had his fear, or his love, or maybe both, killed too long ago. He despised the extremism of the human lusts, because he wasn't a human himself. He lost his humanity completely. Hence, he became a killing machine, a loose madness, or the extremism itself.Balance between your love and your fear or you'll be the killer and the victim. That's one premise which will make this film live for so many upcoming generations.",8,2,2,20 July 2007
Wayne's World," Lovably Childish But Languid !
","The second in list of movies were based on 'Saturday Night Live' sketches, and not one of their best, since I don't think that there was a movie that outclassed their first movie (The Blues Brothers - 1980) yet.Of course forget about any plot, drama, or even action. It's a chain of separate jokes, not real sketches, created by (Mike Myers) in not one of his finest days, noticing that it was his first as a screenwriter, so as a lead actor. The best 'joke' was the sequence of 'we don't make commercials, or do anything for money!'. But unfortunately the rest is too sluggish, so the movie's pace is slow. And don't wait for witty parody, or real guest stars. For instance, (Robert Patrick) reprised his role as the evil Terminator swiftly and tastelessly!Overall, the whole thing looked really average or lower, comparing to (Myers)'s next movies or not. The performance is as weak as you can get. (Ed O'Neill) is unbearable as usual with so unfunny lines. (Rob Lowe) delivers feebly and frigidly, not trying to be even slightly droll. The survivors could be (Myers) with few of his own spontaneous moments (Camera 1, Camera 2!), and (Tia Carrere)'s performance.There is restful feel and innocent spirit all over it (the tripartite endings a la' Scooby-Doo style). At least it didn't resort to be the easy filthy comedy, with tons of dirty sexual material, or bad taste stuff, the way (Myers) himself would do badly 10 years later in (Austin Powers in Goldmember). It's not bad, it's short fun, lovably childish but languid. Anyhow, (Mike Myers) had to have a point to start from anyway. It's so clear that he wasn't aware of the movies' capacities well at the time.Finally, how this one succeeded superbly, grossing over 100 million dollar (!) to an extent that made a sequel--is such beyond me. It proved that (Myers) had certain something that the people loved, and it gives me hope that well meaning work with simple efforts can work big time.. Sometimes.",Null,0,3,22 February 2009
The Big Lebowski," The American Loser !
","The American young man who fought in Vietnam yesterday became now a 40-years-old hippie, all-the-time stoned unemployed bum, who lives the crazy world of the early 1990s America.. As what exactly? The possible hero of this very world! How is that? That's the knack, and the crack, of this black farce.(Lebowski) is the name of the rich famous billionaire, and the name of the poor sluggish dude also, and the irony of the situation means that both of them are men, disabled (one crippled, and one doped!), having problems, yet only one is noble or at least less mean. This is the main irony which the whole thing had been grounded on, because that last characteristic of our good old type 'A' idiot is the very thing which made him such a hero of his world, and what a world indeed, as we've been watching such a punchy bunch of the most sick, contemptible, foolish, defeated, dull, opportunist, criminal variety of all time, or to be specific that time of 1991 which the movie chooses carefully to make its events and point of view too.The Coen brothers made a sarcastic epitome of the American society by vivid sense of humor and such a dark discerning satire in the same time. Whereas the whole commentary vents the spleen on the powers of the big master corporations and their small beaten victims too. There is that unique caricature community: the rich people are good deceivers, hate each others, have no moralities, or even a next generation! Then the poor people are maybe quite the same, but with some love (the friendship of Dude and Walter), some innocence, and had been utilized by the rich people all along; the rich Lebowski and his game with the dude, the powerful characters who want the dude to bring the money or find the wife, Maude Lebowski / Julianne Moore wants to get a baby from the dude as a typical non-noisy father! They form, all together, the ideal pieces of an anti-Utopian collapsed world!Moreover, what is the art of this world anyway, as the truthful reflection of it: the high art of (Maude Lebowski / Julianne Moore) which's absurd and too arduous to understand, long TV shows which their author lives as dead maybe like his viewers who the rest of them are as deranged as (Walter / John Goodman) his biggest fan, and finally the porn movies which their producer sees logically that the molds of entertaining have gone low so let's make sex as nobody needs stories anymore!So in that kind of world there is no wonder at all when you have such a passive funny losers like the dude and his mental violent friend who both are dying by their Vietnam past and playful present, so bowling is their life which literally and metaphorically was their daily illusory victory, and now it makes sense when the Coens put it all cleverly in the early shadows of the Iraq's war as maybe the next helpless Vietnam; as if nothing changed since the first sin as long as the dude is still the same lazy brainless tumbler, being the perfect puppet in the hands of the perverse bossy players who had all the powers. However, his sole virtue is that he's well-meaning to be everybody's fool, and smart enough to grasp their perfidy and meanness after all!I loved some talented touches which create such solid comic cosmos: The owner of the house is a ruling man yet another loser, (Saddam Hussein) the president of Iraq at the time became an upcoming part of the fancy big game, as in the second dream, where the dude himself is the ball in the hands of the rich brats, the office of the rich (Lebowski) looks like the oval office of the American president in the white house, The Dude is flying over the city then falls; like failed Superman, the fine genuine cowboy, or the original American, played by (Sam Elliott), is the narrator; ironically named on the credits as The Stranger, there is no complete sane love story in here at all! And the sudden death of the poor friend, (Donny / Steve Buscemi), 'as all the young youth who died before him!' to make sure that the next generation will be sick already by the defeat of their lousy mentors, and they'll be weaker to get along with all of that dominating madness around. Although I didn't like that death as something a bit out of the drama, but maybe it was made to confirm the sense of loss at the end.There were some flaws; like how did the dude perceive the hidden truth?! Characters like a homosexual bowling player named Jesus, or a landlord who loves experimental theater weren't comic or part of the drama, being just odd characters for oddity. But aside from that, everything was hilariously sincere to the true lunatic nature of the lead character and its world; for instance, the 2 dreamy sequences. As for the acting, it was a dexterous comedy from everybody, but I thought that (John Goodman) did much better, and more accurate job as (Walter) than (Jeff Bridges) as (The Dude).All in all, it's some rereading of that world which is unbalanced; utterly like its hero (Lebowski), so by far you must understand easily what the meaning of (The BIG Lebowski) is. It isn't a reference to who would be the most important (Lebowski) in the movie, No, it's a smart hint to a Big community of (Lebowski) dudes out of the movie!",Null,6,13,4 January 2008
Unbreakable," Breakable !
","At the time, me and one of my friends used to discuss movies all the time non-stop. He watched (Unbreakable) first when it was released in 2000. And when we met days after it, in the funeral of his grandmother, he told me: 'Without the end's twist, this is worthless!'. Then, after 5 years, I watched it, to say: 'This is not worthless. It's just disappointing'.Artistically, it got many good points. M. Night Shyamalan does know his tools pretty well, so he entertained us with perfectly exquisite shots, and real special atmosphere. But there were other, more deep, matters to bother.For one, how David, the lead character, doesn't know that he lived a whole life sick-less?!! I deemed the scene, where he was asking about any vacations that he had before, a joke! Or how he forgot totally about the swimming pool's accident which was about to kill him, to a degree that made him a myth for years later?? I think that the lead that we watched wasn't a senile old man who forgets THAT BAD, or someone who suffers amnesia!Then, the character of Elijah. On a simple level, it outwardly had excessively special features (bizarre haircut, strange raincoats, a 50s car,..) while that fits him as an odd man, they - in the same time - sort of conflicted with the fact that he did all of these crimes, since according to these very features, he was that easily traceable. However, what really provoked me was relating a 'glass cane' to him. It was impossible, rather so silly, that a fragile person like him leans on a 'glassy' cane!On a profound level, the motive of Elijah wasn't believable. I thought he would search for his opposite, to be his friend, or to have a serum from his blood to cure his rare illness, or anything that may sound more logical and less weak.I hated how the powers of David were many; he sees through clothes, knows people's life by touching them, bulletproof body, super muscles.. etc. And I hated more that 'borrowing' from Stephen King's (The Dead Zone). Why to destroy the originality of your work by your own hands Mr. Shyamalan?!!For some reason, I didn't like the sequence of the first mission; which centered on saving the kids from a deranged killer. I thought that's another movie.Samuel L. Jackson did a good job, but Willis wasn't that completely convincing. I mean yeah, the man used his radiant charisma so fine, and Shyamalan's camera did a watchable effort with his face, however I clearly refer to his performance at the last scene; that dear Bruce.. was a fake! I don't know why, but I believe that big part in Willis, the actor, stopped caring much, or caring, since long time ago, being, in most cases, just an image of cold-hearted or senseless charismatic star!A lot of viewers, such as my friend, banned the movie for being just less interesting or surprising than Shyamalan and Willis's previous, surely more profitable, movie (The Sixth Sense). While I'm aware that not all the movies need to be another (The Sixth Sense), I though (Unbreakable) was less original, having important points done weakly, and most of all, missing a substance, or a human message. It's attractively polished glass, but still a glass.. a breakable one too.",4,1,2,12 February 2010
Fight Club," I'm Jack's Amazed Viewer and Lonely Heart !
","Did I love it? Yes.What's the most beautiful thing in it? The way it makes its conflict. I mean hey, this is a movie about getting sick of the modern time, how the urban lifestyle and values can make you a psycho, and fighting the materialistic civilization in a savage way. However in breathless motion picture where action, dark comedy, psychoanalysis, let alone a big twist, are mixed in one entertaining package. Here is where counterculture meets the video clip style meets fascinating movie-making. At one point, I found myself saying: 'This is how philosophy can be bankable'. This is mainly the effort of one really great writing.The thing is we all love to have a stronger alter ego. We all hate the fantasy we live and can't reach. And we just board of building what we can't complete. So how about being stronger, reaching the fantasy of destroying anything complete instead?. It said a lot about a very hot psychological problem that the human of today lives. The too many rich corporations became an evil empire. Hence there must be a resistance. Angry, bloody, and lunatic herd of resistance. Connecting this idea, as a brainchild of today's twisted world, with a fast-paced totally unpredictable movie that touches all the victims-is the exclusive greatness of this script.The details are so insightful and indicative (loved the soap one; as this society washes by its dirt!). The speech of (Tyler Durden) is made to touch every condo's sleepless soul out there, and it did. The narration is one of the best narrations I ever experienced, if not the best. The atmosphere is utterly different and smart. The image is artistically dim yet attractive; it makes the sense of exile intimate for any city's human. The scene in the car, running without holding the wheel, summarizes the mad and profound nature of the whole thing. The acting is flawless; the way how the cast loved the movie is incredibly felt on-screen. (Fight Club) is what (Edward Norton) will be remembered by, for years and years. All of that makes watching this movie again a must.What did you hate in it? Firstly, the obscenity of some parts. Then, the heroine's face and aspect. While being a part of dark, sick and wild world, she's supposed to be a sort of another face for the kind hero. And she was somehow a symbol of love that the lead needs and refuses in the same time. But (Helena Bonham Carter)'s features and looks were scary, creepy, and unbearable. Plus, a bit of illogicality. For instance: the scene in the police station, in which the good lead is about to be castrated, wasn't acceptable; so his army will do it blindly? He's their beloved leader! How all the screams and blood are going to be hidden?!, etc. And something ruined the finale for me; how to shoot yourself in the mouth, then be alive and capable of speaking?!On a deeper level, something was deficient in the start. The introduction of the main character somewhat missed something. (Chuck Palahniuk), the author of the novel which this movie is based on, said that the motive to write it came up with an incident he lived: 'After being beaten up on a camping trip and returning to work he found that nobody mentioned, acknowledged, or asked about his injuries, because if they did, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary.' This 'societal blocking' wasn't so well-portrayed on-screen, seeming theoretical and - at best - borrowed from other movies. In another word, the important meaning; concerning how this lifestyle can generate violence, since this kind of life is emotionally violent hence psychologically destructive-wasn't shown at first in an original way. I wanted that very incident to be included, and it's in a way, but not effectively.Furthermore, I think that the movie just focused too much on the subject of the schizophrenia at the end more than anything, which mirrored itself badly on the ending. Yes, it's a journey to complete chaos, a war that the crazy side in it must win, but I felt something cut off, as if there was another more expressing ending thrown away somewhere by the hands of the studio, or the movie makers themselves. But anyway, who said that there is 100% perfect thing?!(David Fincher) is maybe one of the ill victims, or just a brilliant film / moviemaker. He understood the material, while not losing it along the way (Why some classics must be sleepy?!!). The man talked about frantic life frantically, yet with sharp mind also. The fact that the maker of (Se7en) and (Fight Club) is the one who did (Alien³) and (Zodiac) annoys me on one hand, and gives me the undeniable fact on the other: Kudos to the script.This is a top-notch movie. Aside from being the next step after (Taxi Driver), concerning the birth of the urban lunatic from the urban womb, it's extremely better than it on many levels. It succeeds in being a 'changing over' itself among all the movies we watch. For me, what will live long the most from it is the way it made its cranky conflict and world too special.So, what do we learn from it? Love can make you sleep tight sometimes.. if you find it. Otherwise, be aware, you would end up being a (Tyler Durden) yourself.",8,1,3,7 June 2010
Captain Marvel," Captain Random !
","I loved the CGI that de-aged (Samuel L. Jackson), the plot twist, and (Stan Lee) cameo. But I HATED many many bugging questions that this movie allowed to be asked. Here you are 'some' of them:Did the movie's writers (8 guys by the way!) thought for a second that the first 15 min of his script was by any mean understandable? It was the best of confusion, and a brilliant turn off since the start. Any movie should learn of that part, and never make anything like it someday! How come that Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) seemed in agreement with nearly every detail on earth? She rode that motorcycle so easily I must say! How dare she steal that motorcycle, along with clothes too, shamelessly like that?! How Nick Fury (Jackson) found her in the bar???!!!! And how did she know that Fury tell the truth about his past as a spy?!Why Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) didn't kill the lead character after capturing her, and taking over the Tesseract?! How did Dr. Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) become the bad guy in the lead's mind in the end? I didn't get that at all! How did Captain Marvel regain her lost powers, her human insistence, and her memory, plus unlock her full super capacities, all at once, after that dull encounter with her role-model-in-reality-turned-evil-in-dream?! Didn't the movie's makers see how the climactic fights were more than boring, since the baddies had no powers against the lead, hence the movie had no conflict, and the viewers had no passivity?! Why Captain Marvel didn't kill Yon-Rogg in the end? That was very poor excuse to set up a sequel! Did they imagine that this was the way how Fury lost his eye?!! That's hugely pathetic! And if Fury began the Avengers initiative in the mid 90s, who did he recruit till meeting Tony Stark in 2008?!!! (I believe he was busy feeding that cat!).(Brie Larson) is a good actress, and academy award winner, so why she seemed like a smiling doll, acting less good than any traditional hand puppet?! And why her performance while saying: 'I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM!' felt nervous and fake?!Why the line of 'I just think you should consider what kind of example you're setting for your daughter' wasn't enjoyable at all? It was unbelievable to be uttered by a kid, and even unfunny as something unbelievable to be uttered by a kid! Why the editing is so hyped at times? It surely ruined the train sequence for me. Why some of the beams' sonic effects sounded like laughable, Atari game-like, ones heard before in Independence Day: Resurgence (2016)?! And why the directors (2 guys by the way!) believed that adding too much flashing lightings would make up for the flimsy script?!The answer of all of these questions are one: They wanted a Captain Marvel movie, as very soon as possible, to be released in March 2019, before the release of Avengers: Endgame in April 2019, therefore the title character could join the big war on Thanos. So they fabricated a script, which looked written in 10 days, hired some people to shoot it, and the result is a glossy bad movie. Accordingly, this is not Captain Marvel, it's rather Captain Random; and it's truly the favorite superhero, and ideal exemplar, of today's Hollywood mainstream movies!P.S: When the first MCU movie with a female lead is released at cinema on International Women's Day--then it's smart move. But when the first MCU movie with a female lead happens to be THAT--then it's disgraceful!",5,5,14,23 May 2019
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2 ÷ Spider Man 3 = 0 !
","This is one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. It has the longest talking ever spoken in an action. And - to make it worse - very few action too. Review the action with me: the appearance of the evil man, Ivan Vanko, in the stadium, the fight between Iron Man and his friend, and the climactic fight. This is by any mean NOT ENOGUH, especially in the presence of this huge amount of talking, which made me feel that I was watching a boring and dry chick flick!Originally, it seems stuffed. The title character has many conflicts: 1) Ivan Vanko. 2) Arms dealer Justin Hammer. 3) His sickness. 4) His fight with the government. 5) His fights with his love. And the way these conflicts were treated, required him to spend most of the time talking, not in action, to be more like the first windbag superhero!Furthermore, the script has idiot points. For instances: in the stadium, the evil man was violently hit by a car, twice, and though didn't suffer any injury later??!!, Iron Man's friend, Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, fights with him while wearing a super suit, then simply 'steals' it to the army, just like that (How absurd!), let alone the matter of the father who hided the secret of the metal which his son would need after 30 years through a design of a city-which was so far-fetched and forced!The action infuriated me. Its choreography was primitive. It begins to ends shortly after, with the easiest solutions. There is not even one satisfying action sequence. Regrettably, it leads to believe that Iron Man is such a weak superhero, with no real powers!What saddened me more was the many talents and qualities around. The movie is a very good looking. It's fraught with strong CGI (hyped a bit, but generally strong), cozy and richly elegant cadres, and radiating image; where everything is beautifully glowing, from the Iron suit to the drinking glasses. (Robert Downey Jr.), (Gwyneth Paltrow), (Don Cheadle), (Sam Rockwell) and (Scarlett Johansson) are fine actors. But they were so wasted, without any catchy roles. See (Rockwell)'s character; he wasn't any interesting or funny. Instead, he seemed like somebody who's on massive cocaine, and acts annoyingly due to it. And I hated (Johansson). She was something moves in terribly tight dresses, and that's it. This is why (Mickey Rourke), with half distinct character, was the one who stole the show, despite looking deformed by many failed plastic surgeries!For its whole time, Iron Man 2 (2010) made me weary and uneasy. It reminded me with Spider Man 3 (2007), and I kept asking which one is worse? Actually, both have stuffed script, many conflicts, and boring pace. And while Spider-Man 3 is overlong with much action, Iron Man 2 is shorter yet with less action. So, in the end, they are equally bad!If I have one thing to say for Iron Man 2's makers, then it'll be: When you will learn that action movies have to be about action?!",5,2,4,21 August 2013
The Hunger Games," Nothing special, except the success !
","This was a disappointment. After the huge financial success it had, with a worldwide total of $686,533,290, I thought it would have been huge itself, but it wasn't, on any level!The thing is, while the story has potential, a lot of it, the execution takes a little bit of many things, blends it with nearly unremarkable everything, and makes something that I saw before in way better shapes!We have an aphorism in Egypt that says: 'It took a song from every film' which precisely describes what that script did. It just chose many good subjects (apocalyptic world, reality TV, class divide,..), however dealt with them as items, not eventually fulfilling anything as high, clear or plenary. So it took a song from every film, to make incomplete musical I guess!(Donald Sutherland) shows up to blabber, with nothing to be figured out. I couldn't understand the relationship between the 2 leads (Katniss) and (Peeta); was his love true, or merely a trick to draw some sponsors' compassion? Did she love him? And on the top of all; what was the conclusion of that story? She's intelligibly in love with another one, so does (Peeta) know that? And how does her original love understand the matter, not feeling jealousy? It seemed like something 'to be continued later in a sequel'! Btw, I longed for a plot twist concerning (Peeta)'s character, but no such luck. The matter of 'let's die together' at the climax?? So the heroine, after facing death countless times, prefers embarrassing the show over 1) Winning the contest, 2) Returning to her lover, mom, and sister, 3) Life itself??! That point lost the creditability, otherwise it wasn't basically built well. For one last confusion; why the black kid loved the heroine; the heroine impressed her? The kid had no mother?? The provocative thing is that this movie doesn't want to answer any question, being willfully tepid, or enjoying deficiency.(Cary Ross) didn't do anything to be proud of, or called smart for. He filmed the movie as unbroken chain of close-ups. The long shots were a few. Aside from tinting the entire movie with one color, that ruined many feelings and situations along the way too. And maybe caused the status of bore which many reviews talked about, knowing that it's shameful to talk about 'bore' in an action anyway! Speaking about that action, I supposed it would be the movie's real point, though it wasn't by far something to glorify, or watch in the first place. For a non-violence lover, such as me, it didn't satisfy my apatite for thrilling adventures, cool sequences, or clever fights. And for a violence lover, such as millions out there, it was tamer than a Tom & Jerry's short!I felt usual, flat and tasteless TV all along. Actually, if (Oliver Stone) had directed it, he would have focused on the bestial media. If (Tim Burton) had directed it, he would have greatly cared about the 2 classes' societies, especially the flamboyant rich one, falling in love with the story's darkness and the show's oddity. Even if (Quentin Tarantino) had directed it, he would have made its violence memorable. See how many chances (Ross) lost, to achieve nothing of his own as well!(James Newton Howard) used to make distinct music scores. This time, forget it wholly. He composed one of his lowest works ever. Nothing was special about his musical ingenuity here, if there was any!However, I suffered the most from (Jennifer Lawrence)'s dead face as (Katniss). With one-note, awfully cold, waxy features, she was a perfect doll from start to finish, not giving any effective reaction throughout, or encouraging any kind of interplay between her character and me as a viewer, in brief; (Steven Seagal) looks more concerned and involved in comparison. And the critics praised her performance? That's more terrible indeed, particularly while everybody acted better than her!It makes other movies, with similar plot or atmosphere, simply surpass. In The Running Man (1987), the anti-media speech was into the point, the action was hot, and it showed the public different viewpoints smartly, not to mention having a charismatic hero. Even in movies like The Condemned (2007), Death Race (2008) or The Turnament (2009), the action was more sophisticated, inventive or at least there!In (The Hunger Games)'s favor, I loved 2 things; the new idea of a flaming dress, plus the assiduous costume designs of district 1's rich habitants. It creatively mixed the old baroque style with the modern camp one. As far as creativeness goes, that was it I'm afraid. Even the CGI of the fiery suits was so obvious!This is as bland as (Jennifer Lawrence)'s face. It's unremarkable at best, except for its success; which assures, to considerable extent, that today's teens are so insecure, living a hell of a bloody competition; where they can reach their goals by going over the others' corpses, and love is a device to get materialistic dreams. As if the movie summarized life through one TV show, and the message is direct; you have to be like it, namely drastic and manipulative, to survive and turn out well. It put other contemporary leads like (Harry Potter) to shame as too innocent and dully utopian, while showing the world's ugly face as wild and no utopia; which clearly, according to the movie's income, hit a giant nerve out there.So although the movie has no redeeming quality, ranking as below average for me; it says a lot by its success, and that's undoubtedly where its only value remains.",5,1,5,3 January 2013
The 13th Warrior," It's not (The 13th Warrior), rather (Dozen of Warriors.. And Their Sidekick) !
","The title's character (Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan) was nobody, but that naive inexperienced young man would be educated by a bunch of warriors whatever he needed to understand all about the real warrior's nature who makes his own luck, regarding that he was a runner from a battle at his country (actually it was the hunt of his lover's parents). Hence, we had a boy who was in his journey to be a man. So what were our problems with this very journey exactly?!How in God's name Mr. (Ibn Fahdlan) did manage to learn the language of those warriors that easily, and only by observing them for a very short time?! It's not genius inasmuch as a miracle, or supernatural power. So instead of this kind of capacities, which even superman himself doesn't have, it was simple to make him know their language from the start!The love story of (Ibn Fahdlan) during the journey was done so hastily, with no solid anything, to not be good or bad love story; it wasn't one in the first place! It was a meaningless thing, like they put it just to assure that (Ibn Fahdlan) was not gay or something. But I got really angry when I saw once some photos having (Banderas) and (Maria Bonnevie) in some unseen scenes. So the love story was there, but they got to delete it. Maybe there were problems between (Bonnevie) and the production company, or maybe they deleted them for some shortening.(Omar Sharif)?!! On the poster in Egypt, we had his name right after (Banderas), with no more names. I don't know about the posters in other countries, but I must tell you: that was so provocative, since (Sharif) had such a tasteless role, with no special value. Ok, so he was here just as the guest star, however without any echo unless his popularity at the middle east, so the intelligence of using him, specifically his name, was for the commercial profits at certain nations. By the way, his character's name was (Melchisidek), as I dare anyone to remember it with the too short appearance!The hot ultimate rally by strong zoom-ins, stirring soundtrack, and fervent performance for the climax's hard battle of a few good men against a huge army of hungry cannibals finally cracked like an empty balloon! It was the silliest joke, the dullest scene, and the coup de grace for any action to end it by these idiot snap shots. It looked like a 75% of an ad about a detergent which would clean all of those combatants afterwards plainly and quickly. In one word, this battle was a loser!The movie was ruled by so tepid spirit all along, from the treatment of the story, to the lazy sequences of the lousy ending. And at last, you would feel that the real hero wasn't anyone but (Vladimir Kulich) as (Buliwyf), or (Beowulf)!, who was the proficient mentor, the one with the most powerful personality, and the one with the most effective scenes too. He was more respectable than (Banderas)'s character which I didn't notice well its transmutation into an actual hero, let alone the languid performance from (Banderas) as well. So, eventually, it could be named (Dozen of Warriors.. And Their Sidekick)!Undoubtedly, 2 things here are perfect: the atmospheric enthusiastic music of (Jerry Goldsmith), and the fact that this movie is weak!So, do you want to know what was the real calamity of this movie? I'll tell you; it's the abbreviation. The abbreviation of how the title character knew the warriors language, loved the girl, became a hero, won a big fight against cannibals. And I just can't decide who's to blame: director (John McTiernan), the 2 scriptwriters (William Wisher) & (Warren Lewis), (Michael Crichton) who redirected some scenes, as I read, or the production company which maybe edited this movie destructively?At any rate, this is not 'An Extraordinary Journey' as the deceiving tagline says. It's poor, laconic and cold another B movie.",5,0,2,14 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Bad, Bad.. Real Bad Beyond Your Imagination !!
","Very few times in my life I've got that migraine, provocation, and the desire to sleep right in the theater. Maybe (Universal Soldier: The Return - 1999) for example, (Miami Vice - 2006) for another. But, this time, I was in such a great anger too!Forget all of the insane people who think that this nonsense is a movie. Forget the fact of (Johnny Depp) being a great comedian. Forget that the first movie was nice and maybe the first also in mixing pirates movies - which we really missed for a very long time - with the fantasy factor, (Jerry Bruckheimer)'s money, and perfect CGI. Forget all of that. Because HERE, you'll find nothing but terrible tragic headache!OH GOD. It's distastefully satiate, so boring, and despite the huge look; very poor. In fact, there is no nothing. No great action, or good thrilling moments. There isn't even a good dialogue or one, just one-liner. At one point, (Depp) managed to escape from some savages, then while getting finally on his ship, he was about to crack a punch line for his failing chasers, but he didn't. Simply no one wrote a thing for that!Explicitly there isn't anything funny, except the case of this plot which I dare anyone to understand it, or even stand it after any understanding. Scrutinize well: The good guys are searching for the dead evil man's heart to finish it, namely kill the man who already lives with no heart (!) but according to these very movies' logic, dead people used to be so alive anyway (just recall the last shot in here), so what could deter this evil man from coming back to life after this so-called killing?? He's living as a ghost already! I told you earlier, noting is funnier than this plot (funnier as odder!).Most probably there wasn't any plot in the first place. They just designed couple of action sequences, one in the middle and one at the end, then put around them too many storylines and unnecessary scenes to end up as a long awful time. Briefly, it's too much ado about nothing. And when the first was good, so with a sequel as bad as this; you must feel disappointed and deceived as well!..And there were 200 million in the production of THIS TRASH???!!! By simple equation, this equals, in my country's money, over 100 movies where every one of them is cost 8 millions pounds. This is extra, and ENORMOUS, reason to be mad, especially when you watch this drivel of a movie!I believe the explanation is that the big blown up success of the first one abetted (Bruckheimer) to milk more and more money from it. However, with hasty - talented in only blabbering - writing, no kind of excitement, no sense of humor from EVERYBODY, with big sophisticated CGI, costumes and sets--the outcome was that uninteresting heavy thing which we wanted to leave the theater while watching it since the intermission!About all the writers of all the previous comments which were entitled (The Best Action Movie, The Greatest Film Ever, BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!!!); it's bogus, it's fake, don't you ever buy it. Most likely they were watching the first one!THE MAIN LESSON HERE IS: Don't believe the huge propaganda, and judge by yourself. But in this very case, bear the headache!",1,3,5,1 July 2007
Rocky V," 60 40 !
","OK, there is a good base here. A movie about Rocky as a father, trainer, with no fight in a ring at the end, only in the street, bringing back the champion to his roots, and his senses. But, it wasn't wholly flawless.There are too many bad performances; the real-life boxer (Tommy Morrison), as (Tommy Gunn), looked like a moving wall, with bad acting yet I can't blame him alone while the script gave him so little to be convincing as a character. (Richard Gant) as (George Washington Duke) was bad, just bad, he lacked the soul to be that mean talkative merchant. And (Sylvester Stallone) himself showed uneven efforts; sometimes he's so fine, as in the movie's start, and sometimes he's annoying, with exaggerated moving and talking; at one of the basement's scenes he delivered a perfect Razzie material!The script was doing so well, mostly during the first half, however many forced matters hurt the final product. The way that newcomer boxer hated his mentor seemed fast. The way the reporters smashed his win into pieces as fixed looked highly 'fixed' itself (hard to believe the line of one of them: 'Fight your cheap lady in the front row better'?!!). Then the way he went to challenge his trainer?? Obviously all of that was done by the writer, more than his characters. Therefore this is the first (Rocky) movie to lack persuasion.I don't buy for a second that the old petulant coach (Burgess Meredith as Mickey) says that long sentimental speech in the flashback. This is not his stony personality, or his verbal dictionary. I even don't think that he, in his most intimate moments, talks for this long. He could have said all of that in one short line, or eloquent gesture. And finally there are too many montages, and too many 'what's behind your ear?' brinks as well! Generally, while the script is smart at places, it's not in many others, and that's the main problem here.The good side contains the preferential soundtrack of (Bill Conti). It brings back a sensitive side to the characters. True it isn't that intensive unless in the last 10 minutes, but that's due to the nature of this sequel. Notice well the way (Rocky)'s theme is heard at the climax, with techno / orchestral arrangement. That wasn't done only to avoid any bore out of reusing the old theme, but also to express that Rocky can be hip, and forever master, especially while he beats, rather chastises, a street kid who belongs to a more modern time than his.(Talia Shire) as (Adrian), and (Burt Young) as (Paulie) must have taken the Oscar. They don't act at all, being too realistic to scary extent. Watching them 'being' their characters is one of a kind treat.The climactic sequence really sums up the best of the movie, or it is the best of it indeed. Despite being based on dramatically weak start, its outcome is a classic piece of cinema which I enjoy apart. And on a deeper level, it shows who the true (Rocky) is, as a very simple guy who wants to overcome the ugly circumstances, where his goal isn't money or fame; it is assuring his talent without questions, to defeat his shortcomings as 'not so bright man', and have the victory of the pure gift when it wants nothing but the pure recognition.(Rocky) here was sort of fighting an opposite young version of himself. The young (Rocky) was in love spiritually (his religiousness) and emotionally (his Adrian). However, that young champ (Tommy Gunn) is in love materialistically only. And while (Rocky) was driven by the desire of being somebody that matters with dignity, beating his dumb image, (Gunn) is driven by his anger and hate, beating the image of his dad endlessly.That's why that sequence for me is, somehow, the whole movie. It showcased the title character perfectly, along with - maybe - the new generation of the talented ones, being bewitched by the wrong lights. It's only the remark of the promoter (George Washington Duke), 'Only in America', that seems irrelevant. As if it is only a way to assure the connection between such a character and the real-life promoter (Don King), using his famous catchphrase.It has one of the most brilliant moments, where the movie deepens into his character to discover a gem of a meaning. I'm talking about the final scene in which (Rocky) goes with his son to watch a (Picasso) painting, saying about that artiest: 'I almost love everybody' as if the simple human, that (Rocky) is, can be, with his pure nature, as great as (Picasso), thinking the same way, saying the same quote, yet naturally and without much sophisticatedness. If only the rest of the movie was as good!Yes, not that classic as the first, without as effective story. But (Rocky V) managed to beat its shortcomings, to be 60% good vs. 40 % not good. Let alone being so nostalgic for any fan of the classic, first 2, (Rocky) movies.",Null,4,5,5 November 2010
Public Enemies," A 100 million dollars home movie !
","This is so awful to stand. And director Michael Mann is the main Public Enemy here!The script, which Mann co-wrote, is deadly flat. It has a cat and mouse chase, only. And forget about the rest, any rest!Who's the movie's John Dillinger? He's a bank robber, in love, hates killing, AND THAT'S IT. Now imagine that that is considered a character compared to everybody else; like J. Edgar Hoover, Baby Face Nelson,.. etc. Look at FBI agent Melvin Purvis; it's the worst written character in history. He's so empty, with no past, family, or mark. What in God's name was written in the script? 'He looks, He orders, He walks, He runs, He shoots'?? Neither the police squad officers, nor Dillinger's gang members, were distinct. The 2 teams were similar guys, who talk blandly; which added bore and unsolved muddle. So, clearly the script's method was: Don't make a good character, or a character in the first place!Moreover, Dillinger used to be beaten by his father (so he became a criminal?!). Purvis kills himself after capturing Dillinger (because he hated police brutality?!!). Well, the movie is too slack to answer. However, even if, why to mention the matter of Purvis's suicide?? To admit that you're too slack?! Grrrrrr!!Question: Dillinger, Purvis, Hoover.. what did transform in them between the start and the end?! The answer: NOTHING. Knowing the hatred that this movie planted in me, and aggrandized during the viewing, I had more character development than them!The people love Dillinger as a public hero, so why is that? The movie answers us: 'Go read history you morons, or watch better movies about the same era!'. Dillinger stays at the home of 2 Romanian girls, so who are they?! The movie answers us: 'Get lost, I don't care!'. One of Dillinger's shooters, hears his final words, but doesn't tell them to Purvis, so why is that? The movie answers us: 'Guess it yourself, I have no time!'. Again, this script doesn't want to be a script!So after ruining the characters, motives, character development, explanations, why not the dialogue too; which was uninspired and useless. Even the script's attempt to make a magical cinematic moment aborts; since Dillinger's visit to the Dillinger Squad offices seems like a fantasy, especially when no one looks at him, asks him for identity, and - in inordinate move - delays in telling him the running match's score!Instead of repairing that stale script, Mann cared about shooting the movie not on traditional 35mm film, but on HD video, to be ALL digital. OK, give the man a break. He wanted to be new and revolutionary. But after watching the final result, please, you Mr. Mann, give us a break!The image is incredibly primitive; I don't recall a TV image that bad. The lights' reflection on the actors' faces is disastrous. You'll be deeply sad for the good reactions of Johnny Deep. That technique has such a cold effect which freezes the expressions. However, the way it was used enhanced the catastrophe. OH GOD, I have never ever watched a director who was so fancy of shooting only the actors' faces like this before! Mann overused the close-ups, which were unexpressive already, as if the plan was 'Go to the eye, the nose, the ear!!!'. It gets boring and provocative with 140 minutes long. And as if that wasn't enough, he shook the camera non-stop, in a tipsy manner which assured that the cameraman was incurable sot!, and created the ugliest, most random, cadres, overstepping realism to amateurishness. The colors were between pale and dark, but I was sick by painting nearly everything with yellow. Whether to represent how the movie's time was old, or how the title characters' life was ailing; that was adolescent. And to make it perfectly adolescent, just watch the camera's shadow, so visible on- screen, too many times to count!Is that your achievement Mr. Mann?! Making an artistically poor, faces maniac, unceasingly tottering, sterilely expressive, idiotically yellow, and utterly amateurish image?!! At one moment, Hoover talks to Purvis about the importance of arresting Dillinger, while Purvis looks way taller than Hoover. So what was the point of view, knowing that Hoover was the one in control? But I would be the stupidest man alive if thought that the cinematography here could utter a thing. And to die out of rage, you find critics who say: 'The picture was beautifully slick and realistic. The cinematography made the cars, headlights, street lights look marvelous'!! My only remark is: Who left the mental hospital's doors opened?!!Only during the sequence of Dillinger waving to his fans while transporting him to prison, and the scene where he was watching (Manhattan Melodrama - 1934), I felt I was watching something close to a movie. Still, Deep was the sole interesting factor in this who's-the-worst marathon. But, regrettably, all of his performance was violently wronged by that pedant cinematography, and horrid directing.With that script, (Public Enemas) could have been a vapid Hollywood movie, but with that directing, it turned into worse: a vapid home movie, yet produced with truly wasted 100 million dollars! Mann has the right to renew, and we have the right to tell him: You Failed. After watching the horrible (Miami Vice - 2006), I said maybe Mann hates his job. Now I'll say it frankly: he's vain or dumb.. namely awful both ways!",1,3,4,29 October 2013
The Fifth Element," Well, it proves one way or another that Luc Besson has really bad sense of humor !
","I watched a lot of (Besson)'s movies, as a writer, director, or even producer, sometimes all at once, and I felt how the man was trying to take the action entertaining cinema to the next level, and how also his sense of humor is so lost!In his entire career, he couldn't pull off one masterly joke. Yes, the action is all here and aspirant, but there is that certain amount of silliness around. (Milla Jovovich) was funny but not that funny! (Bruce Willis) was right in between the 2 phases of the old lively comic Willis (Moonlighting's type) and the later cold unfunny Willis (The Whole Nine Yards)'s one, or to tell you the truth, in here he maybe passed it to the second phase already! (Chris Tucker) is TOTALLY UNBEARABLE to say the least, this guy really must own a secret to be in movies till now and to have his name over Jackie Chan's name and bigger salary also in their average franchise 'Ruch Hour'?? He lost the Razzie award for that year because it went to the only one who could be more awful: (Dennis Rodman) in (Double Team)! Even fine actor with many faces like (Gary Oldman) hackneyed himself to the utmost with no profit, or for the sake of making any kind of attractive and distinct evil character; the same case you would find it again in (Besson)'s less silly, more appeal, same stupid (Leon)!Whenever (Besson) put his touch, everything becomes madcap, horrendous, and most of all ridiculous. I liked the main idea as good plot for: 'you must save the world my son' + 'Shoot 'Em Up' kind of video game. As a bonus this time, (Besson) assures that: being spiritual is needed (which's a great and rare message indeed), the woman is the basic element, and how the hero must be American to sell your action flick internationally!The whole movie was forced or graceless which exposed the story as too empty. The dialogue is extremely not droll. The characters are stereotypes with inner-scorn. The ironies are just tasteless. The cartoonish atmosphere was mostly blazing, but lacked wittiness and elegance. The monster creatures weren't scary; maybe that was the point, however they weren't clever or interesting either. The camera's angles looked scary and strangely loved to deform. The performance is all bad (thank God that Ian Holm was there). And the semi-nude outfit of (Jovovich) was so cheap and degrading. As a whole, the movie was ruled by effective repugnant spirit like your classmate who specialized in saying the most non-laughable jokes ever, and desperately continues saying them. Watch carefully just one scene when (Willis) finds no escape from the reporters in every corner; it oozes intolerability with all the meanings of the word. This is perfectly the kind of works that nominates for the Oscar of the best effects, sound effects editing, and doesn't make you laugh or amuse you fully in the same time.(Besson) was so determined on giving it some different style (the operatic singing, Cheb Khaled singing in the background of the flying car chase,..) to present the French contribution in making such blockbusters, but all in all that was relatively influencing factor as the silliness attacked outrageously. It's more like when you love the colors of a drawing and hate, just hate, the drawing itself.In most of his movies, (Besson) wanted to make the forthright American action in the American way to compete with the real American movies. He succeeded in much of this mission, but sorry, he didn't - especially with movies like this one - surpass any of them, despite how (The Fifth Element) was once The most expensive French movie ever made.Objectively, it's loud brainless comic-book, with entertaining detached sequences, if only you can stand its innate ridiculousness. Subjectively, I was hoping for the ending since I was in the movie's middle! In best cases, I consider it a good (Blade Runner)'s spoof, but with no laughs!",5,2,6,30 October 2008
Batman Returns," 'It's the so-called normal guys who always let you down' !
","Watching this movie for the first time was unforgettable nightmarish experience. I remember ranking it as one of the worst sequels, rather movies, I have ever seen. The time was momentarily excruciating. The dark atmosphere wasn't a Hollywood falsity. Danny DeVito as the penguin was totally creepy, and no funny at all. He was outrageously ugly, too sexually suppressed, moving in great uproar, roaring non-stop, and gushing black liquid out of his mouth. In brief, a devil from hell would have been nicer! Michael Keaton himself seemed spiritless, acting indifferently as if he was forced to do the job, being the movie's least interesting character. Overall it ranged between gloomy and dreadful. Even the slight comedy was very black. Everything and everyone looked factitious, so hyped and none-enjoyable. And at the climactic sequence, I wanted to runaway from the screen. Did I say that I don't like the Batman character in the first place?!After 10 years or so, I re-watched it. You know these times when you re-watch your top bad movie to recall what did you hate in it (a little bit of exploring yourself), to review how low can Hollywood go sometimes (a little bit of schadenfreude), or maybe to just punish yourself (a little bit of Masochism?!).Anyway, I discovered that it is not utterly the Hollywood formula to picture a superhero. There is a bold and deep satire where the businessman and the politicians are exactly the society's rich robbers and ruthless killers. Added to their victims, like (Catwomon), who were literally killed by them, to know that honesty is a kiss of death in this world, and if you can't beat them join them. This poisoned society of Gotham (or Gothic Sodom), which's nothing but a dark portrayal of the modern materialistic America, had been done so darkly to extreme degree. The movie looks like nothing but a disturbing film. Although I believe Tim Burton learned the lesson early, understanding that in Hollywood - at the best of times - you give the studio what they want (Batman, Planet of the Apes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) to let them give you what you want (Edward Scissorhands, Mars Attacks!, Big Fish). But unfortunately, this time, he gave the studio what they wanted in a way that they didn't want. So it was natural that they deposed crazy Burton as a director, making 2 more sequels of their big and loud flicks, however TOO COLORFUL and MEANINGLESS to extreme degree as well!Few times in the American cinema, there was a dialogue that could be so smart. Review with me these examples: 'You gotta admit I played this stinkin' city like a harp from hell'. (The Penguin). 'Women. Nothing surprises me, Chip, except your late mother. Who'd have thought Selina had a brain to damage. Bottom line, she tries to blackmail me, I'll drop her out a higher window'. (Maximillian 'Max' Shreck). 'You didn't invite me, so I CRASHED!' (The Penguin). 'I may have saved the mayor's baby, but I refuse to save a mayor who stood by helpless as a baby'. (The Penguin). 'Two lives left. I think I'll save one for next Christmas' (Catwoman). 'Why is there always someone who brings eggs and tomatoes to a speech?!' (The Penguin while being bombarded by food).According to my comment's title / a quote from this very movie, Burtun doesn't love what's normal. See his movies to know that well. So it isn't about loving the term 'Super'; it's more about dealing with it differently, or abnormally; if we want the right word to it. This is a different interpretation of a superhero movie. It is serious satirical fantasy, avoiding being a joke, or pure action ride. The comic book movie wasn't less naive like this before, the problem though is that it wasn't more heavy like this before either. You may love it, or hate it. I hated it highly at first, and then respected its difference later. Not all the movies have to be the same thing.Despite the fact that (Batman Returns) looks and feels like Danny DeVito as the penguin for most of the time, it is very rare; as abnormal Hollywood movie. If you love the kind, this one won't 'let you down'.",Null,2,5,16 May 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A deliberately bad car !
","The opening credits sequence of this movie is clever. Painful to know that it was the first and last clever thing around.First things first; we have 2 brothers. Everyone of them is half human, half wolf and immortal. So how come is that? What is the significance of the first scene? What it did say about the relationships of the 2 brothers, their mother and their father?! After that dull scene, let the party of dullness begin!The movie enjoys presenting characters, just to kill them off 2 scenes after. For little instance, the old man and his wife from the farm are about to speak then PAAM PAAM! For bigger instance, the movie's long list of now-there then-where superheroes. Given that we're in a superhero movie, where you go to have a good time with characters that have supernatural powers, then this is more like what the disappointing superhero movie is all about!The main characters didn't have better fate either. Stryker is deprived of any magic as an evil man. Look at the way he appears out of the blue, in every scene, to have a laugh (the weirdest one is the one at Scott's school). To have even louder laugh, see him ordering one of his henchmen to kill Wolverine, right after he made him totally indestructible. Not only this, he didn't hand over that killer Wolverine's sole destroyer: the Adamantium bullets! Furthermore, Stryker's son is mentioned, however nothing is really said about him, or his daddy's tragedy with him, so everyone who didn't watch (X-Men 2 - 2003) will never understand ANYTHING!Unfortunately, the idiot points are plenty. And it's lamentable of course for any movie, but as for an X-Men movie, it's super lamentable. For instance: if the point was faking the death of Logan's wife, dragging him to the lap, injecting him with Adamantium, then erasing his memory, so why not erasing his memory FROM THE VERY START?!!! If one bullet of Adamantium can kill Wolverine, why unleashing the Frankenstein-ish Weapon X on him first?! If, again, one bullet of Adamantium can kill Wolverine, how come that 5 of them only confused his memories?!Generally, that third act is unforgettably idiot chain of events: The whole surprise of the wife being alive, and having a sister, was melodramatic, forced and superfluous. That wife's revenge out of Stryker is so funny; pushing him to walk till his foots bleed, knowing that we're in a small island already! From where did Professor X know about the mutants? And isn't his short appearance is recycled, obviously, from his first encounter with Wolverine from (X-Men), with the same dialogue of 'I can read your mind' yet spoken to Scott this time?!! Then, Logan's wife has a supernatural power, and he didn't notice?! Wolverine climbs the giant cooling tower to escape from Weapon X?! Apparently how stupid Wolverine, rather all the movie, is exactly!Hugh Jackman looks pretty angry in every shot (naturally, since he must have read that script!). He was so serious in a load of nonsense, which is ironic and sad. To add more irony and sadness, I knew lately that he produced it too! Liev Schreiber can't be his character. They needed someone with Jack Nickelson evil touch, not a shadow of that. Danny Huston as Stryker doesn't hold a candle to the great, first Stryker, Brian Cox; who was actually interested in reprising his role from (X-Men 2), but Huston was just cheaper! The rest, as you must have watched, were pure cameos.David Benioff and Skip Woods wrote it. Rarely when they make something I love, or in other words: don't HATE! Simply the first wrote before (Troy - 2004), and (Stay - 2005), and the second alone wrote (Swordfish - 2001) and (Hitman - 2007). As you see, they are both masters of fatuous, yet noisy enough, masterpieces (should I say bombs better?!). Save the surprise of Victor Creed as someone who works for Stryker, I can't find one worthy-defending point in their script. That script made the movie uncreative and lost. It uses pages of stories that we don't know, fills itself with stupidities, then makes a third act of tacky B movie, with kind of loose endings to allow a possible sequel; which's a foolish ambition considering the case.Director Gavin Hood makes average action with always long shot to embody a catchy moment. But the editing couldn't join his work in beautiful way, just snappy unfair pace as if it's a trailer, plus the not too huge budget was there. So, eventually, I was watching a chopped off and poor imitation of (X-Men) movies. Therefore, it can't be compared to the series' previous movies, maybe to a movie like (Elektra - 2005), where it even loses to the coherence of (Elektra)!(X-Men Origins: Wolverine) is murdered by rushed script and directing; which became a usual crime in Hollywood of today. Humphrey Bogart said once: 'The industry hurts itself by making so many lousy movies, as if General Motors deliberately put out a bad car.' Well, here's one for you!",Null,1,3,13 December 2011
Troy," It Could Be a Satirical Troy !
","Hollywood wanted to make the tale of 'Troy' starring (Brad Pitt) as Achilles, and so it did. The original story is supposed to be big, but Hey.. (Brad Pitt)'s name is sure bigger, so not to care much about anything but the star's stardom. Therefore, they put some storylines around him that would make enough movie. However, to tell you the truth, I think casting (Pitt) was Achilles tendon of this movie! He didn't convince me, whether by the look or by the performance, that he is the strongest soldier in the history. Sometimes he seems laughable like a delusional college boy who thinks himself the legendary hero!Generally, despite the huge look, it was average. Just few lines captured my attention. The editing was about making a distinctive personality for the movie unlike most of the contemporary movies, but it didn't wholly work since the story itself doesn't want to be that distinctive. (Peter O'Toole) as (Priam), and (Brian Cox) as (Agamemnon) were great though in not a great movie. And I hated the nudity, it's Hollywood's adolescent way to attract audience, which cheapens its movies highly!It's provocative to see all of these cold shots for endless warships, or innumerable armies (read: CGI, NO, rather Cee.. Gee.. AHHHHYYY!) THEN you know about the 200 million Dollar budget!! It's irritating since it wasn't that portly sight after all. I hankered after Stanley Kubrick's (Spartacus); which was made 40 years earlier, and without Computer-generated anything! I bet the budget went like this: 50 million for the CGI young men who worked in front of their computers, 50 million for the costumes, sets, etc, 50 million for the cast (Pitt alone took 18 million), and 50 million for the most deceiving publicity at all; imagine how they pay too much for the guys who come up with resounding taglines that appeared eventually as naively general like: 'For Honor, For Victory, For Love, For Troy'!(Wolfgang Petersen) always has that special quality; he mastered here some artistic sad cadres like sublime drawings. But it shows that he wasn't enjoying making an old war movie (I believe Ridley Scott was jealous). The scenes weren't stately as they should be. The legendary halo is taken, and not for the sake of human look inasmuch as the sake of making another flick. The fights weren't unique or memorable. Yes, (Petersen) managed to do it fair, but without so many brilliant moments, or deep meanings. Unless my belief that the story works perfectly as a deliberate satire against the American war on Iraq, since the mighty force can make wars, kill thousands, destroy a world for pure foolishness, or pressing instinct, where absolute power is absolute corrupter. So the old empire is nothing but the new empire, being dull, possessive and mad as its kings; which could explain the obvious sense of bewailing at the soundtrack with all the long, gone too long, mourner female vocal while Troy was being destroyed for no fault it did.If that wasn't right and I'm having delusions, or very rare coincidence, so this is just an ordinary Hollywood blockbuster, that evoked the missed sword and sandals movies of the 1960s. But it didn't outclass its antecedents of classic epics, or leave a weighty mark as a drama or as a war movie. Even the well-meaning idea of being a satirical Troy wasn't fully played, or boldly aimed. Anyhow, a (Brad Pitt)'s fan will be happy, though maybe Achilles in his grave won't!",3,0,4,28 December 2008
Terminator Salvation," Terminator: An Early-Terminated Franchise !
","Once upon a time, James Cameron wrote & directed a movie. It made big bucks. Did I say that that happened in a town named Hollywood? Because there that means: sequels. Lots and lots of them. The thing is, this time, I don't care!Simply I don't like the previous 3 Terminator movies. The first was a sci-fi slasher movie, with 2 chased persons; a woman and a helper good guy (lovers to be), being chased by a violent Terminator (played with mega coolness by Schwarzenegger). The second was a repetition of the first, with 2 chased persons (mother and son), Schwarzenegger as the helper good guy, all being chased again by a violent Terminator (with some historic, really great, CGI). The third is more repetition, with 2 chased persons (lovers to be again), Schwarzenegger as the helper good guy again, all being chased by a violent Terminator again and again however played by a girl this time. I slightly enjoyed it, not as a sci-fi or an action, but for its first-time ironic remarks towards Schwarzenegger's character (or anything). As you see, it's a game of switching cards, while the attractive sides get poorer, and the plot gets thinner!They could have made a fourth one with 2 chased persons (father and daughter), Schwarzenegger as the helper good guy in fully animated cartoon, all being chased by a violent Terminator yet played by a kid. Well, sure that could have been better and newer than what I watched!(T 4) can lose the patience to watch, and to review rationally. It's sick to read all the time 'From the producers of The Terminator', 'Form the mentality that brought to you so and so'. Because here it doesn't mean a thing. Even if we talked about it as enjoyable waste of time.While being the no slasher formula, and so expensive movie as well, it got even more poor and thin. It has no story, just some excuses to fabricate chases. It repines about the machines while we saw none of their leaders, or understand what their agenda is. It looks written by a machine itself, because nothing human about it. Not a comic relief or even a good line. Many points seem copied from other movies; the love story between a runner and a girl (Part 1), the mighty enemy dies at the end then comes back (Part 2), the matter of the buddy kid (Cameron's other movie Aliens!).Christian Bale isn't the lead of it (a woe). Sam Worthington is (an extreme woe!). However I can't blame him alone, the script gave him nothing to do but to jump around. By the way, we were made to believe that John Connor is the one and only leader of the future, to find that he's usual guy (AND AFTER 4 MOVIES ALREADY, HE DIDN'T SHOW A PROOF OF EXCELLENCE YET!!).No one knows what's meant by 'Salvation' in the title?! Is it the salvation of Worthington's character from being a machine to be human? But even if, he was human all along!! It could have been more interesting if he was a helper man, then we discover that he's a double agent / machine who, at last, gets sympathetic, helping the humans, sacrificing for them, to live his 'Salvation' anyway. But no such luck!I didn't understand why Worthington had to be someone who almost traveled from previous time? Or from where exactly this apocalyptic society brings its fuel and vegetables? If the lead exploded the factory of the human-like machines (Arnie in a terrible CG-ed cameo), how it'll go into the past?! And the most bugging one: If the machines are so BIG themselves, why to produce a human-like type? Or rather why not to travel back in time, by themselves, not to murder John Connor, but to take over the world?!!It's absurd explosion after another, with a huge irritating emptiness in between. I pitied Christian Bale. He's a fine actor, so what brought you here pal? He tried his best to be serious and deep in a movie that has nothing serious or deep. The action isn't genius. Only the sequence in the middle of the movie (the lorry chase) which is above average. The fighter motorcycles was a good addition, but not in a good movie though. It ends with weak battle, lower than the aforementioned one. It's clear that this movie gives no satisfying thing!It's Hollywood at its poorest and richest conditions. Poorest ideas and entertainment. And richest, rather craziest, budgets ever. Can you imagine that this heavily dull and tasteless movie was made by 200 millions dollars?!! And I thought that Titanic, with 200 million and sure better shape, was not that good movie! With a sum like this, America can make a university for studying cinema, maybe it would graduate more brilliant scriptwriters who wouldn't waste millions on garbage under the name of Blockbuster anymore!So if you search for some escaping time from your pathetic life, then this one will teach you how your life isn't that pathetic after all. According to the 3 sequels, I believe that (The Terminator - 1984) was better being left alone. They aren't uninteresting movies only, but unnecessary in the first place. 2 of them copied the first with no clue about what's later. Then that later couldn't find something respectful of any kind to present. What confuses me isn't who made these movies? I know; people who are greedy or ignorant (or both). It's who does enjoy them?!!Finally, 3 too similar not great movies. Their only bright points, Schwarzenegger's coolness and part 2's CGI, weren't here. So if this very expensive, bad, fourth one says something; then it's the fact about (Terminator) as one of the most unnecessary franchises ever made!",2,3,6,24 November 2010
The Day After Tomorrow," So What's Wrong With The Recent Disaster Movies ?!
","Weak Drama: Nearly there isn't much of a drama but the main event's noise. There isn't running theme but being a hero, a human who can sacrifice, or not. Some may die because no dramatic reason; as the disaster is insane, so the screenplay must be too!Not Too Many Stars: One very important point. The 1970s' memorable disaster movies were cleverer. The producers knew early that there wasn't much of a drama, so they hired big names to cover the small storylines, the bad dialogue, and the unfound purgation. Every movie was a star-studded, which was a smart tradition that disappeared during the 2000s. Maybe because of the shameful reputation of some of the previous era's movies as proud turkeys; (The Swarm - 1978) is a pretty good example. Or maybe the big budget of the CGI left no money to bring golden casts. Or the stars of today refuse being in a movie that may not focus on them inasmuch as the disaster. Anyhow, now they deal with one star, sometimes half a star!, and bunch of unknown people, which exposes the shoddy scripts, and lessens the attraction. The funny thing is that the only disaster movie in the last years that crowded all star cast was the black comedy flop (Mars Attacks! - 1996).Hyped CGI: Let's be honest, now the majority of the movies have obvious special effects. I hate, in most of the cases, to see that computer work and exaggerated too, I'm an old-fashioned guy maybe, but the good old stuff was somehow more believable, coarse, and effective. In the 2000s, it's just so exposed, and adolescent. And they put the real thing proudly, as the making, in the DVD, and sometimes as advertisement while the movie is shown! They ruin the whole thing by their own hands!! Just compare (The Towering Inferno - 1974) with (Independence Day - 1996). It's like live on air from a disaster zone vs. video game. I'm not who you can call: a Stanley Kubrick's big fan, but at least he said about 8 thousand extras for (Spartacus - 1960)'s battles: 'This Is Not Enough'. You can call me a fan of that!The Truth: WAW, maybe the only time to witness the 1970s beats the 2000s in something!Thank God For: The TV, Cable, DVDs, etc.. to re-watch that again.Now, About This One (The Day after Tomorrow - 2004):Weak Drama: I didn't like its drama. Yes, there was a father who wanted to reach his son, but there wasn't more! The strangest thing was that this movie got, unlike maybe all its likes, an issue to arouse, and a case to propound, meaning the abrupt global warming. But it dumbly didn't serve it much, since dramatically I didn't feel the selected characters to catch on some lucid meaning out of their deaths, or even got emotional because of their performance; because there weren't respectably written characters basically. So the 'end of the world' wasn't the hero here intellectually as it was visually.Not Too Many Stars: Although the cast presented fair performance, but the flat characterization didn't even make me worried about them. God. Even the connections between them weren't strongly built. They transformed into marginal cameos in a skillful CGI show; which's old fact about disaster movies, however this time the presence of (Jake Gyllenhaal), (Dennis Quaid), and (Emmy Rossum) didn't make me lenient with it!Not-Hyped CGI: Save the phony wolves, it has some of the sanest CGI, and it's - in fact - the whole show. Missing this movie in theaters is something to regret for as it's the sole thing to be watched there. The movie's CGI was the very-well made element, and maybe what this movie was all about.The Truth: Compared to Roland Emmerich's previous 2 'end of the world' disaster movies, (Independence Day - 1996) and (Godzilla - 1998), it has better CGI, and some satire anyway. But it's also less less intense, and less fun.In itself, I consider (The Day After Tomorrow - 2004) a little action movie, yet sad, with good image and some inside message. But I didn't find any attribute that could make it my movie, or qualify it for a second viewing.Thank God For: There is no sequel. Yippeeeee!",5,1,2,12 September 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," 'Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream. That's how I get by !'
","According to Gore Verbinski, the Pirates' trilogy director, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) was a character-driven film and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) was a plot-driven film, so to make the whole saga work, he wanted to make Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007) a combination of both plot and character. Well, Mr. Verbinski, I think that you'll going to be burn in hell for your huge HUGE lies!The plan was to mix the Hollywood blockbuster action with a fantasy epic, but the outcome was billionaires' nonsense. It is a catalogue of incredibly awful script done by a sum of money that could repair an economy of a small nation!It's too dense, with too much sophisticated sets, costumes, and CGI. It has countless events, dialogues, and characters. Speaking about characters; why all of these teams of pirates?, Jack's father?? AND ALL OF THESE JACKS??? It was like 'loved Jack?, so take many of it, all the load you can get!'. Simply, that was for filling the time of the second in the worst 2 sequels that wanted desperately to turn the first stand-alone (Pirates) into a trilogy anyway, at all costs, most probably to imitate the mightily successful Lord of The Rings of the same decade.The unbelievable events are endless. Excuse me for forgetting some, because the movie did make me dizzy, and for days after it. I recall that the transforming of the black augur into Godzilla was farcical, like these writers got nothing to do. The moment of the Asian pirate giving away his ship to Elizabeth while his dying can't be more imbecile to write. Why he did that? (rather why his character is made in the first place?!). The plot is about killing someone who's already DEAD (the shoddy issue of Pirates 2 continues!). It's hard to believe that Jack has a female lover. And the end, in which Jack thinks of another treasure, is painful; since they actually aspire after a FOURTH ONE!The dialogue was unstoppable windbag. While having nothing remotely funny, it tried its best to sound so wise, ending up as idiotically wise. Just read this: 'Barbossa: The world used to be a bigger place / Jack: World is still the same. There's just less in it'???!!! It was too serious in the wrong place. Originally, taking the nonsense seriously is bad. Here's a rule that sums up the movie utterly!Notice when it, out of the blue, goes to criticize politics, negotiations, and stuff (WHYYYYYY?!!!). That uncovers clearly the way this movie was made: the writers allege something that looks considerable, while it's baloney, then the director strains himself to picture it, mostly wearily, by super wild budget and never-ending money. It could be the highest provocative foolishness I have ever experienced cinematically. Because the brainless costly jam that they all made; lacked anything suspenseful, produced a deadly bore, and gave the feel of a surreal titanic that immerses slowly!So, it's more boring than the Bold and The Beautiful, more ridiculous than Tom Green, and more heavy than the whole 3 prequels of Star Wars (and I thought that George Lucas is the only billionaire who makes movies for himself!). In brief, annoying wasn't more expensively portrayed like this before. By the way, this is 'The most expensive film ever made, not adjusted for inflation, where the budget ran at $300,000,000', and 'Filming started without a finished script'; connect between the 2 pieces of info, and you might get the picture of the contemporary Hollywood!Nevertheless, I liked things from it: The first sequence. The visually dazzling daydream of Jack; concerning rescuing his ship by cooperating crabs. The ship when it overturned to another sea; now that's a fantasy. Some of the climax's action; however it was like a lonely island, solid and rational, in an ocean of hallucination; being the best climax for a big action fantasy that I haven't seen. Moreover, the presence of this movie, as it is, in reality, to be easily memorable example for a familiar tragedy nowadays: zero as a script + 8 zeros on the right of one number as a budget for that script!I can't hold it; these lines, from the movie itself, fit perfectly as wicked comments about it: 'You add an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium', 'NOBODY MOVE. I've dropped me brain', 'Once was quite enough', 'Why would he do that? Because he's a lummox!', and the most expressive one about my condition during the viewing: 'Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream. That's how I get by'. Believe me, that's how I get by the majority of the American blockbusters lately!This is made by lummox people, with impudence and millions to spend. It's none other than nonsense epic, too long, too crowded, and too soulless to be entertaining. It's exactly like Davy Jones; rich, ugly, and dead, yet alive noisily and evilly!The producers get their millions back. And millions of us get punk'd. It's the game now, where their aspiration equals our exasperation.",2,1,3,16 May 2011
Spider-Man 3," Too Many + Too Much = Too Bad !
","_Too many storylines: Spider-Man vs. the thief Flint Marko (after turning into Sandman), Spider-Man vs. the photographer Eddie Brock (after turning into Venom), Spider-Man vs. his friend Harry Osborn (after turning into avenging new Goblin). Spider-Man vs. Spider-man (after turning into evil). Spider-Man vs. his love Mary Jane (after turning her back on him), and Spider-Man vs. The killers of his uncle (after turning around the investigation). That caused a spider web which the movie, and us, fell into for too LONG time (139 minutes to be specific!)._Too many unnecessary matters: Spider-man deforms his friend's face; while he could have injured him only! The evil photographer is dating the chief of police's daughter; so why is that?! That girl herself, a model, is the chief of police's daughter for what exactly? Spider-man's friend loses his memory?! Ahhh, I know the answer for this one; a cheap way to postpone his battle for later. Right? At least it has a possible answer!_Too many coincidences: The evil photographer is in the same church that Spider-man goes to randomly, right in the middle of the last's conflict with himself. The chief of police's daughter, that Mary Jane hates, is in the same restaurant that Spider-man goes to, right in the middle of his proposing to Mary Jane. The thief Marko runs from the police into a governmental lap, right in the middle of doing a nuclear experiment. Sandman, in his first attack, hides in a lorry full of sand, which appears accidentally right in the middle of chasing him by the police. A catastrophe hits of all the buildings the one that has the chief of police's daughter, right in the middle of her photo session, and in the exact moment that has her father in the same street too! The old butler, of Spider-man's friend, suddenly gets his memory back, telling his boss the clue which exonerates Spider-man from murdering the father, yet not before being right in the middle of Spider-man's desperate battle with the evil guys. OK, this is not drama anymore, it's unbroken chain of jokes, knowing that I didn't write ALL the list of coincidences that I noticed as well!_Too many laughs in the wrong places: of course the look upon the friend's face, deformed face, when the old butler remembers, VERY LATE, to say the truth; it's priceless, looking more like 'Do you have any final words before I eat you?!'. However, the bigger moment is when Spider-man goes to see his old buddy dies, saying: 'Hello pal, how are you doing?!' OH MY GOD, I erupted in laughter! Now here's the one that you nearly killed his father, stole his love, caused him a memory lose, deformed his face, and he got stabbed instead of you, to die miserably, and you just come to him with a very VERY stupid smile upon your face, saying happily; 'Hello pal, how are you doing'???!!! This has to be the greatest unintentional comic moment in history. Strangely, the true 'intentional' comic moments in the movie (the editor in chief's secretary, the restaurant's receptionist,..) were totally unfunny!_Too much repetition: didn't you notice that in all Spider-man's movies to date, the third act HAS to be about kidnapping Mary Jane??!! What about aunt May for god's sake?! Kidnap the hag for once you fools!_Too much silliness: and naturally I mean every single second that has Tobey Maguire on screen, and the matter of killing the first thief that attacked Spider-man's uncle, how Spidey would get away with that? Ahh, blame it on the black evil material I guess!_Too much disbelieving: a loose metal pillar can pull down *floors* in a skyscraper?? Many CG images were so fake and childish. And I, Ahmed Abd Alreheem; a simple human being from Egypt, declare it, as high as a scream: If the entire world believes, I DON'T BELIEVE, during 3 movies already, that the man behind the mask IS Tobey Maguire! Terrible matter in a superhero movie to know, all the time, that the hero isn't super at all!Although I loved the special effects of the moving evil material; especially the scene with the car hanged over a building by endless black rubber-like ropes, and the sincerity towards the oldies on the soundtrack; with 'I'm Through with Love', 'Stormy Weather', 'L-O-V-E',.. etc. But compared to all of the above, this is too little!It's clear that the movie wanted to deliver an action scene for every 7 minutes, and it did. It's clear that it wanted to make a Spider-man epic, and it did an inflated, so ridiculous, and forced one. And it's clear why the makers of the (Superhero Movie) chose Spider-man to be the main laughingstock for their parody one year later!They should have called it (Who's Evil Now), and not due to its story. When 5 write it, to make not Spider-man 3, but almost 3 Spider-man movies in one; then this is venom. Yet, paying 258 million dollars on that script itself; is like falling into shifting sands. See who's evil now.. and dumb!",6,2,6,16 December 2010
Ocean's Twelve," The Difference Between The Entertaining Illusion and The Illusion !
","This had more vitality and stars than the first. But ended up being lower than it.First off, the script. Oh that script. It suffers from too many characters, exhausting twists, and incredible silliness. It even whines about a daughter and her lost father, a loving wife and her thief husband who she forgives lately for no apparent reasons, while there is no characterization or whatsoever form the start! The irony of having (Pitt, Zeta-Jones, Clooney, Roberts, Garcia, Damon, Willis, Mac, Cheadle, Coltrane, Gould, and Finney) with this script kills me. Most of them have no necessity at all. For instance; what Gould did do else talking about defecation?, what Cheadle did do else moving around the minim replica?, what Mac did do else being in jail for all the time?!!, and so on and on. Aside from a certain sense of bore, it created also such a frustration that made us really feel 'HOW WASTED!'.It leaves you with numerous questions; who was that wealthy American, the faceless one in the flashback on the yacht, that wanted the gang to be stopped? Why Finney, as the greatest thief, agreed with his pupil (Nightfox), then double-crossed him later? If Ocean's 11 robbed the egg earlier, why they went to pull off the 3D trick with the fake Julia Roberts plan? (brilliant way to mark them ALL TOGETHER in the police files!), and if that was done for going to jail with Clooney, so Demon's mom gets them out, then why bother yourself using that strange plan B?, just send that mom to get him out! And if Ocean's 11 went to rob (Nightfox)'s palace while they don't know about his hidden cameras, then they're stupid.. exactly like this movie! Obviously, that was for the sake of twists that assume being 'smart' or 'smarter than you dear viewer', while they're wholly not. As you see, it moves from the relaxing 'don't think', to the shameful 'brainless', to the insulting 'you're brainless'!I hate the movie makers' confidence that they can make dumb errors and lazy points and get away with it in the name of coolness, post-modernism, whatever. Can anybody tell me why Mac's character was in jail for? Or what did Zeta-Jones's character say to Coltrane's in the interrogation room to break him?Speaking about that nasty confidence, the dialogue is SO PAINFUL. They thought when very unfunny lines are being said by cool stars then they would be funny. Well, that's the definition of ridiculousness, which this movie has MUCH of it. Review some with me: 'If you're gonna ask if you can ask me a question, give me time to respond. Unless you're asking rhetorically, in which case the answer is obvious - yes.', 'Doesn't this guy believe in fresh air? / He opens the second floor window every now and then. / What does that mean? / It means he opens the second floor window every now and then.' And the ugliest '..That guy doing Potsie is unbelievable'. I didn't have that dryness out of the worst sitcoms!Further, thinking that making fun of fake Julia / real Julia, and useless Bruce Willis, led to terrible sequence. While not finishing the jokes is always bad, the movie so foolishly savors it to the max (the lost catchphrase of the stand up comedian, the talk about Willis's movie scene..). Saw the moment in the bar with Clooney and Pitt laughing a long, so detestable, laugh at something that we don't know! Did they think that when these 2 Hollywood stars do it, then we must laugh as well??!!I knew later that George Nolfi, one of the main writers here, wrote a never made John Woo movie named 'Honor Among Thieves', then Warner Bros. asked him to *adjust* it for the Ocean's characters. According to what I watched, he made a chock-full messy mix. Remember fine, that guy is the same one who wrote (Timeline - 2003), (The Sentinel - 2006), and (The Bourne Ultimatum - 2007); namely some of the most confident shoddy scripts I have ever seen!To burn it more, let's talk about the direction. Clooney said in a TV interview that the first Ocean movie was a salute to the 1970s heist movies (Huh?!), and the second one is a salute to the 1960s ones (Double the Huh?!!). Is it because the second was shot in Europe? Actually Steven Soderbergh was more 70s in the second, knowing the weird angles, shooting outdoors, the hand held camera, etc. at any cost, he tried to make the Hollywood stuff yet with different feel, using a flavor from the realistic cinema. However, the outcome is shockingly tasteless. We didn't enjoy the stars through image or basically a good script. And it isn't an enjoyment on the level of being artistic either. I only enjoyed the laser beams dance, with the eastern music of Thé à la Menthe, performed by La Cautionit, as the one thing that could be re-watched.(Ocean's Twelve) shows a new type of awfulness where endless colors are thrown in sterile vacuum. It alleges being intelligent, funny, cool, and light while it's dumb, unfunny, cold, and heavy. I believe in entertainment it's supposed to make a dazzling illusion, not being full of illusion yourself. This movie is like its (Nightfox); so rich yet with tons of vanity, thinks the job is done, while it's not.It was produced with $110,000,000, to gain $125,531,634? I think it deserved less!P.S: When Willis as Willis met Roberts as fake Roberts playing the real Roberts (dizzy!), then asked her about Danny; you have to think was that for breaking the fourth wall (as if Willis ran into the filming of an 'Ocean' sequel, and asked about Clooney's character), or was Willis a party in the scheme already?? The thing is 'Danny' is Roberts's husband's name in the movie, and - after little reading - I knew that it's also the nickname of Roberts's husband, Daniel Moder, out of the movie! Anyhow, it was the top of this movie's dullness, and one of the most confusing moments in movie history!",1,2,5,23 January 2011
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Return of the Jedi, Birth of the Video Games !
","The whole first sequence of Jabba's palace was so poor and done in tight limits as a TV sketch; it elucidated the standard of the non-impressive directing in this sequel. The supposed special moments (Yoda's death, Obi-Wan's surprise about Leia's hidden fact, Luke's confession to Leia that she's his sister..) weren't portrayed especially at all. There wasn't much of a drama, romance or relief. And it had a certain sense of boredom all over it. The movie is divided into 2 halves; the first is an adventure one that reminded me of Tarzan's movies in the 1940s, and the second was a pure war of a movie, running semi-randomly and uninterestingly for most of the time (20 years later, The Matrix Revolution would fall in the same mistake). And by the way, hasn't Deathstar been destroyed in the first movie (Star Wars)? Where were the creativity and the imagination for God's sake?!!The Ewok are proofed to be the most dull and unattractive creatures ever appeared in movies (Did you see their plastic dead eyes?!!). John Williams's music wasn't as memorably impassioned as it always is; in fact, it was silly and weak. This is surely one of the worst movies Harrison Ford had to do; unlike the first 2 movies, he got nothing respectful, or only nothing, to do! Mark Hamill is now a better actor, but sorrowfully with nearly no emotional stuff to perform. Carrie Fisher looked 20 years older, and putting her in skimpy clothes was wrong, JUST WRONG! And why I felt that the face of Sebastian Shaw, as Darth Vader's real one, was so laughable, fitting more a shaved Santa Clause!Except the Hayden Christensen's appearance as the good Anakin at the last shot, the added CGI was a bad-taste joke, being distracting and made by Lucas for Lucas. For instance, the music act in the Jabba's palace was completely re-cut and altered.. so what?!! Watching things like this made me think that Lucas has an inferiority complex, whereas he got once not enough money to fulfill his dreams, then now he avenges on these days BADLY! I'm afraid that after the 'Special Edition' in 1997, then the other new version of 'the DVD release' in 2004, one day Lucas would give us the 'Special Edition of the DVD release' where we find ourselves seeing Hayden Christenson in older makeup as Darth Vader in the unmasked scene, modified CGI shots for the Ewok's eyes, then a never seen moments having C-3PO going to the bathroom or maybe Jabba singing to Leia!Despite the fights, the explosions, and the big bucks it made in 1983, (Return of the Jedi) is the least important movie in the old trilogy of (Star Wars). Something is hasty, cheap, and lifeless about it. I believe Lucas was satisfied with having just a large battle and happy end, making an empty spectacle that lacked being human along the way. It's where the movies began relinquishing being movies anymore, and approached being a frank video games. So as a movie, I rank (Blue Thunder), (Uncommon Valor), and (Christine), from the same year, over it. Simply, they got more exciting characters, places, and events.Finally, for the sake of saying something good, compared to ALL the next trilogy of prequels, (Return of the Jedi) is nice piece of entertainment; at least here the CGI, the chatter, and (Ian McDiarmid) aren't given much on-screen time!",6,0,4,5 May 2010
The Expendables," A Cross Between The Seven Samurai and The Muppet Show !
","So (Stallone) wanted to work. (Stallone) wanted to remake The Seven Samurai as violent mercenaries. (Stallone) wanted to pay a tribute to the 1980s; its coarse feel, legendary fistfights, no CGI, and soldiers of fortune having adventures in tropical countries. Well, (Stallone) got all of that, but missed other things.Some points bewitched me, like: The touch of the 50s car; summarizing the whole matter of an old yet metal tough persona. The idea of modern Seven Samurai (who don't die for the sequel!). The deep intention to embody the conflict as a war between a noble worrier, (Stallone), and a black picture of him that he's afraid of turning into someday, (Eric Roberts). The endless wicked one-liners. The cool funny names (Hale Caesar, Toll Road, Yin Yang, Christmas, Barney, Gunner, Mr. Church..). The distinct armlet scene. And if you're hungry for some explosions, the climactic sequence is designed for making you more than full!On the other hand.. the script; it's almost stupid. In every Seven Samurai version, one of the big secrets of its beauty remains in the variety of the characters of the Seven Samurai themselves. This time, underdeveloped is the main theme! For little instance, (Randy Couture) has no character, no dialogue, no deeds but hitting some dude in the last 10 minutes! Look at the dictator as well. There was a try to make a character out of him but failed. I hated the moment of (Roberts) killing the dictator among all the latter's army; How come for god's sake?!! However, it's naught compared to the moment when the leads agree, suddenly, to sacrifice their own lives since (Stallone) wanted to go back because he loved the girl's drawing??? I was eating myself out of rage during the moment of 'We'll die for you man, but don't ask us twice!' This is not macho reaction, this is frank idiocy!Clearly that script had no time for anything. Therefore, while watching the last big fight, after being away from understanding the tragedy of one nation and one public, you must feel absurd and mindless. Now making a homage to the 1980s action movies is one thing, and tracking down their bad points is totally another!Then, (Stallone)' face! It reminded me with a line said by (Walter Matthau) in (The Odd Couple II): 'I'm not as old as I look. I had this plastic surgery done recently, and the quack doctor botched it up!!' (Stallone) must have injected himself with a gallon of botox, so he looked 1) As someone who looks old AND having a botched up plastic surgery! 2) Unable to act (while he happens to be originally Mr. Sylvester-the unable to act-Stallone!). And 3) an ugly freak with dented eyebrows and about-to-drop eyeballs. In brief, he was creepy and pathetic like a C Horror movie's monster! Why he didn't let his wrinkles show up; it's obvious that he, as well as his character, is OLD!The rest of the cast wasn't less bad. How come that a respectable critic said that (Mickey Rourke)'s crying scene was 'serious acting'? It's well written yes, but his face was melting for God's sake! (Terry Crews) is no peer to (Wesley Snipes) who was the first choice for (Caesar) character. (Dolph Lundgren) was terrible except while he's fighting. (Schwarzenegger) was only a name, used in an inside joke scene, so concerning an action; sure we waited for more. True that (Roberts) was lively; pumping some blood to the movie's acting, but still (Jason Statham) was the one who stole the show. Aside from not having a botox bulimia, (Statham) was lucky enough to have the closest thing to a 'character' around!Where the 80s millions budget did go? I'll tell you: The explosions. The thing is they went on and on and on at the end, as if (Stallone) was compensating the movie's drama by them. Speaking about annoyance, the 'mince' violent is. (Willis)'s remark at the church, added by him to the dialogue, was too dirty it's awful. And using the CGI annoyed me very much. Why not making a 'completely honest' old fashioned action movie for a change!Stars + men on a mission + good fights + one-liners + explosions = a winning formula, despite how average it's done this round. The movie resembles its music at the climactic sequence; while looking grand it's - in fact - nothing but hot extended crescendo, with no real melody. Enthusiastic but not moving, huge but not meaty, and amusing but not greatly amusing. So on the scale of fun, (Stallone), the movie-maker, did a good job anyway. I believe with another script, and less botox, it should have been very good though.(The Expendables) is a B movie celebration a la old fashion. It dreamed of (The Seven Samurai), but in terms of stiff faces and cartoonish characters, it got so close to (The Muppet Show), to become eventually a cross between both, without much of their perfection.",Null,0,3,2 February 2012
Scary Movie 2," One Thousand and One Razzies !
","Since the 1970s end, dirt-exploitation became in fashion through Hollywood's mainstream comedies, with a lot of producers enjoying manipulating the lowest human desires, with heavier and filthier load as time goes by. Till I came to a point where I believed that they deal with animals, not humans anymore. Naturally, (Scary Movie 2) isn't far from that point; it's nearly it!In 2000, the Wayans brother's (Scary Movie) was a hit. For good parody out of the 1990s horror / teen movies?, for the dirty comedy? For both? Anyway, in the sequel, their target was making a parody of many horror movies, TV shows, and TV ads, while immersing all of that in an ocean of filth!Filth, in this movie's makes' conscience, is comic. In my conscience, it isn't. It's only filth; purely, powerfully and torrentially made this time too. They sure thought 'Hey, if 50 filthy joke made millions, so how about 500!'. Not obligatorily a good move, but the producers must have LOVED it, giving the Wayans a mighty freehand to be as filthy as they could, to bring double the money that the original brought!But profitable or not, the movie is ultra awful. Watching it is like swimming in a dreadful sewer. And completing it assures nothing but the masochist side in every human. The real comic moments are rare coincidences; it's like running into sane persons in a nut house. Here, filth comes with many shapes. Chris Elliott's character does the biggest job of it. I bet, the Wayans peed themselves out of laughing while making this, and we just were left to smell the conclusion.. of their peeing!Action movies are all about many action sequences. Toilet humor movies are all about (Scary movie 2). However, this movie is cheaper than porn, because it could have been more but ended up being a nightclub designed as a real, so busy and so dirty public toilet. I won't say comedy was never more loathsome; it's loathsomeness was never more loathsome. The problem is that not nominating it for even one Razzie Award as if refers to its being as a good comedy anyway. Well, a 1000 Razzies from my side then, and one Razzie for the Razzie foundation itself due to its shameful overlooking!(Scary Movie 2) reached a zenith concerning the dirt-exploitation. Being that extremely overfull produces 2 kinds of audiences; a die hard lovers, and a die hard haters. I'm with the second. My only consolation is that it has fewer farts than (Nutty Professor II: The Klumps - 2000)!Finally a note: 2001 witnessed a wave of comedies with various nastiness, like (Scary Movie 2), (American Pie 2), (Freddy Got Fingered), (Not Another Teen Movie), (Say It Isn't So), and (Shallow Hal), being not what 2001 is distinguished by, rather ashamed of! Though, after 10 years, I have to thank God. Because having in 2011 only (The Hangover 2), and (Bridesmaids), refers to how this sort of comedies has reduced through the years. Ahh, does humanity finally prevail?!",1,1,1,26 May 2012
Alien," One of The Best Women, Slasher, Sci-fi Movies Ever !
","This is a milestone before being a masterpiece. A milestone on many levels too.I think Hollywood was late at making the action hero as heroine. In fact, that didn't happen, internationally, until the late 1960s. Since the start of the 1970s, the things had surely changed. With Swedish movies (Thriller - en grym film -1974), Japanese (Shurayukihime - 1973), or American (Hannie Caulder - 1971), and (Foxy Brown - 1974), it was clear that thereafter the women - European, Asian, American black or white - could be the violent lead, having the ability to retaliate and exterminate.Look at these 3 movies from (1978), and the roles of their leading ladies: (An Unmarried Woman); a divorced woman who got to be totally on her own. (Coma); a doctor who got to stand up to a corrupted business. And (Halloween) where a young girl, instead of a whole suburban, got to face a mad serial killer. Yes, finally 'she' got the power to be independent, fight corruption, and kill anyone who wants to kill her. One year later, there was another female lead that got to face insatiable inhuman slasher, all by herself, in never little movie named (Alien) where woman is allowed to kill any 'thing' that wants to kill her this time.The tagline: 'In space, no one can hear you scream' could refer to the scream of the woman in the space of old manly ignoring. But not anymore. The name (Ripley) sounds close to Rebel and Repel. She got the reputation of one of the most memorable, real tough, heroines ever, without being just a scream queen, a man's sexual fantasy, or hating the white community like in the Blaxploitation movies. She looks ordinary but she isn't, using the brain and the brawn in the same time, and assuring eventually that the woman, that kind of woman, could be the only soul survivor in any community, or the one who'd inherit the world!(Ripley) vanquished 2 aliens already to accomplish that women wouldn't be an alien again in action movies, or in roles that were occupied by only men before. Now 'she' can win the championships out of the movies, and in it as well. (Sigourney Weaver) isn't that impressively beautiful to tell you the truth, but SHE IS as an actress. She didn't win the Oscar for this role, or even got nominated, but she'll always be my favorite (Ripley).Now, remember the Horror movies of (1979)? (The Amityville Horror) was the haunted house movie. (When a Stranger Calls), (The Orphan), (Phantasm); I'll save you the trouble; they're all about a monster, innocent people, a hunt. But did they have any meaning other than entertaining you?! I don't think so.Here, the sense of seriousness, the meditative pace, and the solid sci-fi just own your respect before your attention. I recall (Ian Holm)'s line: 'You still don't know what you're after? Don't you?!'; it's one of few cinematic lines that deeply fascinated me. The whole atmosphere presents cleverly a dark world where the human, even the best of human, don't know everything. These shadows give the story intellectual dimension, to be simply a movie about man and the unknown. This is more profound, more enjoyable, and more immortal than any other work where there is always a masked pervert and a screamer girl. (Alien) fulfilled uniquely being a great, if not the greatest, slasher movie!It got its own personality to amaze and amuse. Before it, the sci-fi movie was whether totally artistic, or just an empty adventure. This time, it brightly had the best of both. This is rare to happen, and hard to achieve.Overall, it's anything but usual, cheap, or easy. It's historically important, variously interesting, and - most of all - always enjoyable. Whatever the sequels did; they're not serious, intensive or artistic as the original. And finally, when a perfect genre movie carries a philosophical message; what do we need more?!",8,0,1,19 August 2009
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," From Yay to Nay !
","At first, you feel that you're in for a superhero super action. But then, you feel that you're in the titanic, while its sinking!Let me cut to the chase: If Nick Fury has a device that transports him from place to another in nanosecond; why he didn't runaway from the car while the attack on him? And if he knew that Captain America's safe house is being watched; why he went to it? And if the evil guy knew that he was there; why didn't he kill him earlier? And if Fury assigned a girl to protect Captain America undercover; why she didn't act professionally and observe anything else that the radio's music was on? And if Alexander Pierce (played by Robert Redford) had a device that could kill all the board's members; why he didn't use it since the start? And if that so-called device could kill; how Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) didn't die out of it? And if Fury died, and became SO DEAD; how he was alive again?! And please, can anybody sane tell me how Hydra was controlling S.H.I.E.L.D. during 70 years??!! So whether the script finds it enjoyable to not telling us the answers, or DOESN'T KNOW THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE! As you see, this should have been named Captain America: Power of Idiocy, or Captain America: The Whys and The Hows!In the climactic sequence, the script nearly committed suicide. If The Winter Soldier saved his friend in the end, how come he would be a menace afterwards?! And it seemed to me that Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie) transformed into hero haphazardly. It's as if anybody Captain America might meet in his life would be a hero, good or bad one, later! And, for the love of God, how Captain America wants to sacrifice himself, again, for saving the world, again, after the first movie?! I believe that there is some unofficial rule that says 'Do not repeat the first movie's end in its sequel'. But I believe that it takes clever people to apply it as well!The dialogue is beyond silly, the information are being thrown at you faster than raindrops in a terrible torrent, and the cliché of 'Kiss me, so the bad guys can't find us' is hateful among all the other clichés, since they look at it as the most trite!The whole cast is infected with the epidemic of Woodenness. Johansson and Mackie were the most sick. However, it was more than painful to see the honorable Mr. Redford turning into wood! When I heard that he would play a role in a movie finally, and that role was in a commercial movie, that happened to be a superhero blockbuster-I was surprised and enthusiastic. I remember things like praising the movie's makers for convincing him to do so, and envying them for having him too. But, eventually, it was the peak of frustration when he looked like a perfect Robert Redford pod. Regrettably, he wasn't evil as a character, but he was so evil as an actor!The movie is overall heavy. It's 136 minutes, yet feels more than that already. The direction of the dramatic scenes was TV-ish. I lived a soap-opera disguised as a sci-fi action thriller. And it came with all the mortal sins; from the lifeless cadres to the awful acting!On the contrary, the direction of the action did awesome sequences. The CGI approached greatness. There were creative, really cool, new weapons. And the Neo-Nazism's plan to take over the world digitally was absolutely fantastic. However, if you think that the virtues' list is long.. Be sure, the vices' list is longer!In its first 2 movies, Captain America pushed me to the 'This will rock' yell, to end up with a 'Rock the boat' situation. Frankly, after this one's end, the boat tanked, and I found myself singing 'My heart will NOT go on'!..Nevertheless, I hope that part 3 will be better than so-so, because I got fed up with 2 of that kind!",Null,1,2,20 June 2016
We Are Marshall," 'Formulaic' isn't a crime. But 'Badly Formulaic' is !
","You know the story very well. You know its end from the start. You have seen the movie before, hundreds of times too. Actually, you have seen all the movies before, since they all feed on the same ideas. So what's the different thing that may make you watch? It's the script's treatment; being a key player in that game of 'making the different thing' which is called movies.This time, there are a true story, some emotionality involved, many characters, and the meaning about the importance of playing more than the importance of winning, as if playing is winning itself; if only you can do it.The movie's feelings are clear. It has many artistic merits, topped by the acting, the cinematography, and the directing; who though that (Mc.G) can make movies else Charlie's Angels 1 and 2?! But eventually it doesn't hold to that spirit of 'different' much.Save (President Dedmon), played by (David Strathairn), the characters aren't interesting enough. Take for instance the lead character. That full-of-life man seems perfect, throwing pieces of wisdom to everybody, making jokes all the time, and his only mistake is not knowing how to change a diaper; which he even did anyway. That, as a whole, is the interpretation of BORING!You can say the same about the situations. There is no scene where I felt how the lead character affected the team in a deep way, not preachy way. We hear about him having dinner with the remaining-alive members of the old team, and never see anything. Why the dead team is out of the picture?! They are like 'Them' all along. Not relating them to the present characters took a lot of the movie's drama. The angry father and the young waitress's line was good, but what about the rest, especially when you don't have, a la the comic version of the same movie, the funny players to utilize and fill the movie with their various antics.The third act is disappointing; it has predictable everything. There is no surprise whatsoever. The scene of the speech is worn-out, with nothing new about it. It's where I was bored to death! The last match is a farce; now here's a worthless and usual TV work. Not writing the end's narrated information right, underling the meaning of the 'importance of playing', caused a laugh in the wrong place. So that *great* coach, with his *great* team, had 9 winnings and 33 loses??!!As you see, with the lack of interesting characters, good situations, smart details, saturated storylines--the movie suffered from dramatic emptiness. That's why (Matthew Fox) and (Anthony Mackie) spent their time just crying! Therefore, the feelings of hope, determination and beating the grief are there, but not actively achieved. And, as a result, the predictability was allowed to run the matters as another sport movie with 'underachievers-go-achievers', so instead of utilizing the trite frame, there was nothing else it, being done a bit poorly too.They tried to use (Matthew McConaughey)'s talent and name to present a distinct lead character, but nothing was thorough about it. And the script tended to a documentary-like trait, which is bad according to the true story's emotional power. See how uneven this movie is!By traditional and somewhat blank treatment, it didn't get to be the different thing. Hence, (We Are Marshall) couldn't rescue itself from falling into the sin of 'badly formulaic'. Using the formula isn't a crime, but doing nothing with it.. surely is!",6,1,3,11 October 2011
Barry Lyndon," A Refined Costume Piece Wore By a Statue !
","I hate when a certain quality sticks informatively to a certain director. (Stanley Kubrick) is best known as none other than The Great (Stanley Kubrick). And whoever dares to object is whether an idiot or ignorant. The thing is this film displays no greatness at all.The narrative could be the only good thing around, since it shows a different character. The lead isn't the idealistic prince charming or the inhuman selfish conman either. He's a fine mix of both, being a real human beyond stereotyping. It chose to use a narrator, which is an old trick to emphasize the satire; towards the human in general this time (dumb to know what he wants, dumb to select the most trivial 'money', and dumb to lose it along with everything else). Despite being 3 hours it floats, not due to the editing inasmuch as the script's short scenes and the story's intensity. So far, so good, or at least not bad. The problems were elsewhere.I'm sick of praising the cinematography of this film. First off it's not that *massively beautiful*. For instance (Funny Face - 1957) is. While being internally tepid, some of the outdoor images can make a fair calendar; and that's about it. Although it's an achievement to develop special lenses to allow filming without electric lighting but using the candles' yellow lighting was so stupid at times, making the meeting with the village's girl and the military's café have one atmosphere. I didn't run into something that smart about the long shots of the Lyndon's castle except being repetitive meaningless postcards. It's solely the scene of the fight between the lead and his wife's son, with movable held camera, that drew my attention, as - finally - something alive!Then the horror. Oh sorry, I meant the music. The choices of (Kubrick), out of the classic music, reflect a one of a kind BAD taste. Who can stand this strangling bore? Not me for sure. The tracks are totally dull and unattractive. Evoking the past by its art proves a mighty failure this time. At one point, while the sequence of rescuing the officer from a falling wall, I was crying due to the soundtrack's paralysis.. really!The acting of (Ryan O'Neal) is maybe the film's lowest point. Nothing deep about it. Shockingly this film assures that he isn't a good actor. I couldn't see the dispositions of (Barry Lyndon) through him. I thought that a role such as this needed (Robert Redford), coincidently was having his moment back then, since he's a master in expressing the fires under icy surface. (O'Neal) has the icy surface only! (Later on I discovered that Redford was the first choice indeed).The rest of the cast did their jobs whether woodenly (all of Marisa Berenson's feelings were expressed in one-note expression), or usually with no performance that could come close to be called brilliant. Now read what critic (Tim Robey) said: 'The film makes you realize that the most undervalued aspect of (Kubrick)'s genius could well be his way with actors' Ha Ha Haaa! I ask; why (Kubrick) has to be always genius? And if he was; then where did he ever go wrong?The way (Kubrick) moves the cast is so primitive and funny sometimes. Why to showcase the thinking of lady Lyndon's son as walking back and forth? Or Ahh, Barry got to sit in the middle of the must-be-empty restaurant to articulate how deserted he became! For most of the time, I felt 'how flat', instead of how 'eloquent'. Further, the scenes are mostly one-shot with not much motion in it, which congealed the visual pace into slow-moving paintings (Kubrick wants to embody the pace of the past??!!). Knowing the way how the cast acted, then I was watching a historical puppet show!Many viewers said that this was a boring film. Most of (Kubrick)'s elements did that perfectly. The film resembles what (Marisa Berenson) looks during it (Ouch!). Apparently the perfectionist, that (Kubrick) was, cared unhealthily for drawing the delicate yellow lighting over the actors' faces to resurrect the time period, more than seeking any sort of interact between us and the shown characters and events. True that he wanted the meaning of the story, not the story, but what's interesting in evoking the 18th century's paintings, music, and pace, while lacking the vitality ridiculously? That produced heavy uninteresting pedantry.The main problem is that the mix wasn't right. The film is compressed between the method of making us meditate, not react (Be philosophical), trying artistically hard to conjure up a very accurate visual and sonic feel of the 18th century as well (Be realistic?!), plus - oh my god - a stiff and dry filmmaking where everyone along with everything is filled up with violent starch or, in less words, the coldness of the Eskimo (Be Kubrick!). The result is 'meaning' and 'techniques' in the front, 'drama' and 'heat' left in the back; namely it isn't an efficient film, rather a refined costume piece wore by a statue, with a very conceited look up its face too. Simply.. your film is highly embellished Mr. (Kubrick), yet spiritless. It's more frigid than Barry Lyndon himself, incomparably!Imagine; what if this movie, as it is, was written on it that it was directed by another person or a newcomer? It wouldn't have this glorification, in fact all the talk would aim at the problems first, and yes.. there would be problems to criticize, not great things by great director!",Null,3,10,8 January 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Where is Darth Vader when you need one !
","Simply, Briefly and Frankly..I remember watching it while my studying at the high cinema institute of Egypt. I was at the theater with some of my colleagues, and after we hardly finished it, we were truly angry, to the extent that one of us shouted: 'What a Junk!'.(Ewan McGregor) is no Obi-Wan Kenobi, he is just a modern star who can make money if you put his name on any movie. (Hayden Christensen) is one of the worst, hmmm... but (Ian McDiarmid), the man with the most disgusting performance, was here also, so one of them was the worst actor anyway (if not both!).The most painful thing was that you wouldn't understand ANYTHING. (George Lucas) and (Jonathan Hales) wrote a script that, save them, no one understood (perhaps they didn't either!). So with the weak performances, the huge momentum of CGI, the fast pace, the too serious, too stray, dialogue, and the many many story lines--I felt all the time a nightmarish maze that the movie got lost in it, and forced us to have the same fate as well!Putting in mind that I love the first saga, especially (The Empire Strikes Back - 1980) which was, and still is, one of the greatest action movies of all time--I think that the fans of the 1970s and 1980s trilogy will hate this new one as much as me. In my humble opinion, any lover of at least this prequel (if there is any!) will forget it, because it's adolescently made. Maybe some of whoever watched it while being a kid, will remember it someday, however for sensitive recalling of their childhood, only!Things I loved? Are you kidding me?! Even the climactic fencing was between cool and laughable! But let's say that (Natalie Portman) was the sole real thing in this; she is tender, and talented, though too little reason to face that tremendous stupidity monster, or survive that flood of torrential nonsense!Long story short, Darth Vader should have avenged on the makers of this!",4,4,10,1 July 2007
"Monsters, Inc."," Pixar's Enjoyable Version of Beauty & The Beast !
","So many reasons made this movie a classic..The great imagination of it; with monsters' incorporation and business, as well as handling the main idea into that hilarious script.The creative voices; actually, it's rare time to have the same fun out of the original as much as the Egyptian dubbed version of it too, with the voices of Egyptian starts like (Sami Magawry) and (Mohamed Henedi).But maybe on the top of it is this main theme of the beauty who went to the beast's city, instead of the beast's palace, to discover the weakness, the innocence, and the comeliness in them both, and to assure the basic motif of the original novel whereas the relationship between man and the other isn't grounded on violence, savagery or 'intimidation' inasmuch as love, respect and mutual understanding.The character of (James P. 'Sulley' Sullivan) continues what (Humphrey Bogart) began, and proves, once more, that the superficially non-charming hero can be more charming romantically, even it was a real monster.I hated the rash ending, where all the evil guys had been arrested easily, though the movie's makers could be forgiven, because they did great deal of work until these very moments.In brief, it's a case where the wonderful scenes are the whole movie. And that's something exceptional that made me watch (Monsters, Inc.) for numerous times.",Null,0,1,25 May 2008
Captain America: The First Avenger," From Wow to Yawn !
","Another superhero movie? OK. More than 10 years now, and we're still living the same. Though, what's the problem, since the outcome is fancy action. Here, there was fancy action, however with not one problem, but many!First off, let's be evenhanded. The cast was well-selected. I believe it's (Tommy Lee Jones) first superhero movie, and he stole the show for me, owning the best line 'I won't kiss you!'. The 'digital plastic surgeries' technique, or the way how (Chris Evans) was pictured shrunken in the movie's first half, was done superbly. I thought it deserved at least an Oscar for its miraculous work. Director (Joe Johnston), who made 20 years earlier one of the best superhero movies and the most overshadowed gems ever (The Rocketeer), did fair job. He dazzled me much during the first half; for example, the first action sequence of running after Dr. Abraham Erskine / Stanley Tucci killers. Plus I loved the last sequence in specific, of 'I had a date'. As you see, mostly the good things lie in the first half. So what about that infamous second half?!Since the first mission of Captain America in battle filed, the events run strangely. Suddenly he has a team of uninteresting, or not taken care of, characters, there is a montage of many missions (read: cold victories), and none of that leads to a snowballing climax, not to mention that none of that alleged team does anything in the finale battle (or else!). That finale battle itself is near to a joke. It has dumbly made chain of fights; the movie transforms there into a video game with someone so used-to-it playing; meaning the lead is having victory effortlessly, killing all without a scratch, going his way facing no danger, and we are watching in bore. And to top it all; there isn't one-on-one fight with the bad guy who, by the way, dies idiotically. In other words; this is the death of thrill ladies and gentlemen!Nevertheless, the biggest problem that this movie has is its emotional core which was explicitly and unashamedly killed. What does provoke much is that the title character was basically meant to generate sentimentality more than many other superheroes, otherwise why the whole line of being sickly, then turning into Mr. superpower?, why the matter of 'We chose you to value power more than others'?, or why Dr. Erskine pointed to the heart while he was dying, as if to assure the noble choice? Actually, the script forgot all of what it already made in the start, and got busy with nothing but the explosions thereafter.And if you think that the sacrifice thing at the end was the possible answer, then let me wildly remonstrate. It was unconvincing with unforgivable holes; the lead could have jumped the plane earlier, and the military could have found him easily later. Furthermore, how he stayed alive after 70 years of coma in the snow? He didn't eat or drink? And I don't remember Dr. Erskine injecting him with a serum for immortality! In brief, that 'sacrifice' was entirely forced. Clearly they fabricated it just to make Captain America catch his role in (The Avengers) movie, one year ahead, which simply takes place in the 2010s. Gives you a hint that the movie's second half had 'else' people involved in its writing!Then, the biggest problem 'I' have with this movie, which sure concerns its inventions. Well, this is a sci-fi that takes place right in the 1940s, however the shown designs, of everything, were so 3000s! OH MY GOD, if Germany had these planes in WW2, they could have not taken over the world alone, rather the galaxy! At one point, I witnessed a Nazi tank in a size of a 3 floors building! And the soldiers of Red Skull seemed like an army of super monsters from the future that needs a doomsday to finish, not one poor Captain America! Even the look of the 'exhibition of future' was too flashy and hip for 1942!Unlike the hairdo of Hayley Atwell, or the exquisitely nostalgic closing credits-the image of technology seen throughout failed to offer the feel of its era, being too advanced to even make believe that it was anyway near the 1940s. The issue of advanced-weapons-in-older-times has been done before in movies like (Wild Wild West - 1999), (Van Helsing - 2004), or (Jonah Hex - 2010), yet in a way that made them look fit and sort of believable. This round they just looked so unreal, not having anything in common with the 1940s, or bothering to have. It's disgracefully bad when you describe a movie with the word 'unbelievable' purposing the wrong meaning!The first half has one annoying downside too. There is a lot of talk about the history of the movie's villain, Red Skull, and his connection with Dr. Erskine, however you won't get it rightly, or at all, which pushes you to ask; why not 'showing' any of that earlier?!At any rate, it's still in the second half. It was uninspired, soulless and routine at best. That caused a sad case of 'Hey, it's cool', then 'Ok, I was a fool!'. However, you're not the fool, it's other people who had huge amount of money to make a movie, while they're not smart viewers in the first place, because if they were, they could have known better about important elements like thrill, feelings, credibility, and made a more hot, human, effective Captain America, not the uneven, 6 out of 10, movie that I watched!",6,1,3,3 September 2012
Top Secret!," Quick Rehearsal !
","This round, (Jim Abrahams), (Jerry Zucker) and (David Zucker) made nothing but a bunch of jokes on the war movies, which didn't hold together as a whole movie. I wished that the parody's most famous team would present something more solid and effective than these desultory weak sketches. True that there was an ambitious intention, but the final outcome was purely deficient.The plot line is thinner than a thread. Most of the gags are juvenile. There are some comic moments that manipulate the cinematic medium for just the manipulation (the bar fight under the water, the library scene played backwards), without at least real laughs along the way. Choosing (Val Kilmer) was a big hole to a ship with already many holes. He had such a stiff face, which didn't fit comedy (or in fact anything!). The supposedly comic lines were delivered miserably by him.Speaking of which, if you noticed well, you would discover that the-stiff-face choice was kind of a habit of the (Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker) team. From (Val Kilmer) in (Top Secret! - 1984), to (Charlie Sheen) in (Hot Shots! - 1991) and (Hot Shots! Part Deux - 1993), ending with (Jay Mohr) in (Jane Austen's Mafia! - 1998). Maybe the studio used to demand a young handsome guy as a lead, whether had a talent for comedy or not! Sure (Leslie Nielson), a regular - and better - face in that team's movies, wasn't always satisfying for the producers as only handsome guy (young age beats talent is an old Hollywood story!).2 things live from this movie: its actively ironic spirit out of the movies' exposed tricks, along with few marginal jokes. It's not a perfect movie in the first place; just a quick rehearsal for (Hot Shots 2) later. After parodying the 1940s and 1950s war movies in (Top..), they would parody the 1970s and 1980s war movies in (Hot..). Btw, character actor (Miguel Ferrer) was in the 2 movies, playing nearly the same role. The only difference was that the last one was funnier and more like a movie as well.",Null,0,4,19 June 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," Like someone talks absolute nonsense yet so seriously !
","Bourne travels all over the world? Why? And how? From where exactly he gets the money to afford it? And how he does it, having no disguise while he's the most wanted man on the plant? Bourne jumps from window to another all over Tangier's buildings while all the windows are opened and all the people are out! How, at the end of that chase, he knew the place of the one he chases? By the last's smell??! The CIA's offices have always glass, with no curtains, so whenever Bourne monitors them, he could see everything. So Bourne, finally, remembers, OK, what did he remember exactly and we didn't know?! Bourne could go inside the CIA while no camera filmed him? (He's the invisible man!). Bourne could survive a bomb that got exploded couple of meters behind him, not only this, he could also run after the one who exploded it, fight him, and kill him (Now he's Wolverine!).Actually, it doesn't have plot holes since originally it doesn't have a plot. They didn't have much to write in this sequel, so they transformed it into idiot chase after another; someone wants to kill dear Bourne, and - surprisingly - fails, added to meeting the first mentor to know nothing new, and putting the whole gang into jail, so easily, by the end. The script reuses many points from the previous 2 movies; the big bosses are watching the lead through cameras in a surveillance room while beating their men, a car chases another.. one flips.. then the always great Jason Bourne comes out unharmed (the trademark of Bourne movies I guess, since it's present, as it is, in all the 3 already!), and - why not - (Julia Stiles)?? The only necessity of doing that is the penury. It has zero drama, zero attraction, and with (Matt Demon) around.. no credibility at all.(Matt Demon) as an action hero is a tragedy. No matter what Kung Fu he mastered, this guy is too poor to convince me that he can waste all of these men in seconds. As a charisma, he's just a flat boy. And as an actor, there wasn't anything to be acted in this movie. See, lesser actors like (Arnie) and (Sly) do the job better. They can convince me as fighters, they have tough charisma, and they act in cool way (like saying their one-liners in memorable wit). So (Demon) here couldn't be them, and that script couldn't give him a decent chance to be a serious Bond either.Director (Paul Greengrass) did some noticeable efforts concerning the action. And he handled the rest with his familiar style of shaking the camera deliberately as a different way to make the Hollywood fun while mixing it with a touch of realism. However, while there is no script to it, and a lot of (Demon), the action ran pointlessly and boringly. The green color that embodies the lead's pale memory, or the vague facts around him, didn't serve much, especially when he *remembers* this time (maybe Greengrass didn't remember that itself!). Sometimes shaking the camera was exaggerated for no reason. For big example, recall the scene of telling the brother that his sister / Bourne's love died; that was really annoying and adolescent!The movie, self-conceited to the max, almost believes itself as one gritty political thriller. But by that empty absurd script, the whole thing turned into a long unfunny comedy. Scriptwriter (George Nolfi) is brilliant when it's about writing a collapsed movie, with dozen of unsolved questions, which looks so confident though. (Timeline - 2003), (Ocean's Twelve - 2004), and (The Sentinel - 2006) are good examples. Every one of them, including surely (The Bourne Ultimatum - 2007), seems like someone talks absolute nonsense yet so seriously. It isn't droll. It's rather pathetic, and with the insistence that it's droll: provoking!Good things? The cinematography despite the over-shaking, the intense orchestrated music despite being unduly on for all the time, and the action stunts despite being detached segments that could be watched separately.It is a mix of alleged script, too many whys and hows, very uninteresting lead, dull everything, and thrilling nothing. All of it encourages you not to interact, respect, hence watch. Long story short; I slept in front of it.. truly. (Ultimatum) is no more than inconsiderable movie that tries desperately and miserably to feel considerable. Let it, its publicity, and its blind fans delude anyone else.

The Aviator," I didn't run into 'great', 'convincing', or 'Scorsese' in here !
","Maybe the worst thing about any movie is asking after its end; what did it want to say? Here, after this bio-pic, it was; who Howard Hughes was?!! OK, according to what we've seen, he's a millionaire with a compulsive disorder, who loves big movies, big planes, and big breasts!As a follower of Martin Scorsese, and a fan of some movies by him, I asked myself why he handled such a project? The best I could reach, from the very movie, was how that capitalist tycoon wasn't another pedant brat (great scene with him setting among Katharine Hepburn's family as his complete opposite). He was a man with many dreams, obsessed with them, workaholic to fulfill them, and - most importantly - a fighter for them against the American administration which, in here, represents the oppressiveness (government) and conservatism (censorship). Simply, this dreamer's ambition is greater than these employees' ambition; he wants the sky, while they want offices with walls have painting stars on them.However, I didn't buy it. Hughes was another capitalistic symbol. Making a movie about him, as a man with a dream, anti-narrow mindedness,.. etc. is a try to read him from very keen angles, making a victorious hero of him, which did give me the feel of 'forced'.Then, it's in the exterior angles as well. While giving it many long scenes, the movie, so provocatively, didn't enlighten us about the man's sickness at all. It was so vague and unrelated to the subject; unless the movie is showing it as just the artist's demons that every time he fights them he wins the best of himself, becoming the hero!There are many whys too; why Hughes loved Hepburn in specific?, why he had that sickness in specific?, why the movie dealt with the man's cinematic career as just the story's relief?, why we knew nothing about his past but that his mom was washing him as a kid, wishing him well?!!The CGI didn't work in some shots. To tell you the truth, I was confused why to use them in the first place. For instance, the garden where Hughes lands his plane on it, after the flight with Katharine Hepburn, was CGI. So was that for cutting down the budget or something?!Scorsese was working out of passion, unlike the usual him. It was more than obvious that he got the things done effortlessly. I have never seen him uninterested on-screen like that before. Most probably it was a deal, a Studio deal, of a movie about the eccentric once-celebrity man; where he gives them what they want, as they want, to give him later the permission to make what he wants as he wants. The smell of this 'deal' is so overwhelming. Otherwise, this is the most tasteless Scorsese, or let's say the most un-Scorsese, movie!Further, a major killer punch; Leonardo DiCaprio. I couldn't stand him utterly. I watched this movie 3 times, and for 3 times he failed to drew my attention, so how about any persuasion?! He seems too boyish and no man. His voice is a child voice. At some points, he looks like a teenager with terrible make-up as a grown up. His face doesn't look like the original Hughes, however that's not the problem. The real problem is that Leo's charisma and talent are so weak to be Hughes or else. Teases me pretty much whenever I watch him working continuously in movies for the best directors of his time, to be one of the worst factors in them, while much better actors, who surely could do higher, aren't in his shoes, having his top chances. In a word, disappointment is the basic thing I receive from him all the times yet. And it gets just bigger every time.What did I love from it? Let me see. The moment of seeing, and hearing, the faucet's water as a torrent of knifes. It's not about expressing the lead's hallucination accurately inasmuch as the expressive power of cinema itself; to speak the unspeakable, and transmit what used to be considered as exclusively doable in other mediums literature is on their top.The second, and the last, thing I loved was naturally the aforementioned scene of the lunch with the idiots 'who don't need to work since they have too much money!'. It was excellently written, perfectly delivered, and effectively impacted, despite my feeling towards how that was part of a truth which Scorsese wants to see, or wants us to see, nothing but it. It wasn't the best scene of this movie; it was the best of it at all.(The Aviator) didn't dazzle me as a biography movie, based on Howard Hughes's life movie, or a Scorsese movie. I'm still asking after it: who that guy was? Not a success by any mean.",5,1,1,13 October 2010
Burn After Reading," Vanity !
","A story about a bunch of idiots. It comes from the Coen brothers, headed by all star cast, and promoted as a crime comedy. That seems OK, if not super, but the outcome is disappointing.It has cleverly made idiot characters and good pace. I loved that case of a twisty world, marrying noir, spy movies with dark sense of humor. So it's unusual mix, spoofing the idiocy of all, mostly the American middle class.We have all cheater, haughty, rude, paranoid, ignorant, bad tasting, crazy about money, sex, or looks characters. Enough reasons to be idiots in the movie's conscience. The twisty nature of the story runs well till the third act, where sure the movie loses much of its power. Most of the viewers got turned off after the abrupt murder of (Brad Pitt). I didn't. Because it's a surprise, and it fits a black comedy. Actually, the problem is elsewhere.Many important questions had been left without answers; what was in Malkovich's memoir?, what's the benefit of Malkovich not seeing McDormand?, what's Malkovich's telephone in the basement said to sadden him?, why Tilda Swinton copied her husband's memoir on a disk?, why the CIA is taking care of covering all the misses? Malkovich kills?? Ahh, because he's angry of many issues! The matter of discovering that Clooney's watcher isn't an enemy is copied from another Coen movie (The Big Lebowski - 1998). And then there is no action, only talks. The whole fates, rather the whole movie, conclude weirdly in just one scene between 2 men talking in a room in certainly one of the most cold, anti-climactic and stupid endings ever made in the history of cinema!Look at a wicked hint like how all the story is about a woman who succeeds in collecting money for 4 plastic surgeries yet on many corpses along the way. Apparently, the Coens hate stupidity caused by mania over pure materialistic goals, seeing in the lousy criminal a perfect laughingstock to showcase that in many of their movies. But (Burn..) is not a perfect movie in the first place. It's headless, literally!This time, the Coens want to show that today's world is absurd and full of idiots. However, the irony fades out due to a drama that went absurd itself at its end. And the waterfall of cursing and swearing didn't serve any drama or comedy; it served only being too nasty to stand! And in the end, they as if thought of us as idiots ourselves, punishing us for waiting things like satisfying ending or good movie for that matter. I still ask: How the Coens led their beautifully complicated lines into that sterile joke?!What if Richard Jenkins's character had some secret around his strange past; being a retired spy, or major CIA man, which uncovers at the end? What if Malkovich turned out to be none other than the head of cooks in the CIA? Or what if the CIA execs are bigger fools; so the world is full of idiots and run by idiots? Originally, the movie, with no redeeming qualities, aborts anything like that, slighting its material and us, selecting to be - at the end - a tragedy of idiots, as if idiocy is the greatest slasher, killing all the stupid characters not even in smart ways. The Coens did it in (Fargo - 1996), and have been doing it many times lately, with (The Ladykillers - 2004), (No Country for Old Men - 2007) and (Burn After Reading - 2008). Aside from being repetitive, it's easy thing to do. And if they write and direct movies about characters that deserve to be killed, then they went so far and so bland!There are some actors, with possibly interesting characters for laughing purposes, but both of the players and their roles were wasted. Malkovich is shouting, Swinton plays the awful image of her, Clooney doesn't add much to his history. The only winners, if I can call so, are McDormand and Pitt. The latter in specific made the car scene really funny, the sole funny thing in those 90 minutes! Naturally, these stars' names on the poster give such a frustration compared to eventually underdeveloped movie. The title does the same in terms of being an espionage spoof. The music is catchy for no catchy events. And no doubt that the best about it is Vladimir Putin's polished yet dark cinematography, which expressed polished yet dark world.This is not a comedy, even black one. It promises and doesn't deliver. Builds and doesn't complete. Well, it's 2/3 movie then. And, most probably, that's because the Coens wrote it while writing (No Country for Old Men). I was quite shocked when I read that 'They would usually alternate every other day for each script'. Because simply when any artist, or any person, does 2 works in one time the assured outcome is whether 2 bad works, or - at the least - one bad work!There is no system. This is what this movie believes in, and embodies for 2 acts, and then suffers from it at the third. It's rushed, mutilated and tepid. The worst thing though was that the Coens produced it too, releasing it as it was, thinking that it wouldn't disappoint by the way how it wrapped things up. This is vanity; which is a short way to stupidity if you ask me!",3,1,6,27 July 2011
Hot Rod," Finally.. A Different Comedy !
","OK, comedy is comedy. Meaning laughs. But humans are different. So comedy had to be as well. However, in the last years, the American mainstream comedies aren't. They are all about teen gross-out sex comedies, romantic - not too variant - comedies, the family, mostly horrible, comedies, the lately always-awful parodies, and the buddy comedies which is the best kind, or at least the more merciful. And there is no black comedies, unless we're talking about that status quo!Thus, with the continuity of this production, nothing became different. Or maybe the different viewer, who got board of all of the above, came to a point where he finds nothing attractive, or unique. Simply, the molds have frozen, so the viewer's ambition. But this time, in Hot Rod, being different was the goods, and being hot wasn't in the title only.It's a story of some underachievers, and their disordered journey to achieve. The thing is they could be teen, but their comedy isn't gross. It could be about the family love, yet in the most extraordinary ways. And it could be a parody, yet not out of movies or TV shows, just the decade of the 1980s.Well, it isn't all un-formulaic, but maybe huge part of its comedy is. It handles the matters really creative, with so right sense of humor. The examples are many, and beautiful; how a reconciliation between 2 brothers turns into rap song-like, a familiar scene of gathering the team; walking challenging whatever, turns into a public riot.. etc.Then ironies that can't be more ironic; The sick stepfather is like the evil guy. The big event at the climax, with the motorcycle's jump, is sponsored and transmitted by 'Radio' station; this is wild and smart idea (it spoofs a matter that had always bewildered me; which is broadcasting footballs matches in the radio!). The rational owner of the station is anything but rational. His station, which he tries to make successful, broadcasts antique songs.There is a funny and lovely nostalgia to the 1980s. Funny in terms of using the old customs, or using the Magnum's so macho mustache. And lovely in terms of using a rallied soundtrack of some of the 1980s most enthusiastic, largely rock, songs. It makes you think that the 1980s was the time of singing for hunting the dream, and fulfilling the hardest!The method of acting relied on being serious while doing, and saying, entirely nonsense. That won 2 results. Firstly, it produced laughs, without turning the cast into buffoons. Secondly, it deepened the honesty of the story, giving those farcical characters a spirit of credibility, and true feel of sympathy; to be a movie about determined achievers-wanna be, not only a comedy that poke fun of them.So it shows known-by-heart story by going off the known-by-heart roads, making its own special personality, to work comically, and a bit seriously too; noticing that the end isn't so happy, with the lead winning due to his try not his striking success, while not resorting to cheap and easy tricks. I know well movies that assumed themselves comic by using the F word heavily, or dealing with: farts, feces, urine, and semen.. Nothing else!Save couple of lines that I didn't like, I enjoyed Hot Rod. It's where you laugh at something, then admire the novelty, and the ingenuity, of it. It managed to be another type of comedy; creative, unpredictable, hence rare. The ones who made it proved how wonderfully different they were. All of that allow one question to leap in my head: Why this didn't have a proper publicity?!",8,2,6,6 May 2011
The Italian Job," An Old Joke ? A Rat Race ? Well, It's The American Job !
","Once upon time, there was a nice crazy movie named (The Italian Job - 1969), and it was just pure fun. As the years passed by, it became a classic, to the extent that some of its simple lines turned into the most memorable ones in the history of cinema! So why after 34 years, Hollywood would remake it?Ok, consider it as one of the usual events in the 2000s, when Hollywood declared bankruptcy, or just about to, with very few original screenplays for the commercial movies. So you would have all the time: A remake of an old movie, part 2 and 3.. etc. of that remake of that old movie, sequels for another movie which have nothing to do with it except for the utilization of its popularity, and some movies that are based on previous comics, video games, TV series, American movies, or French, British or Japanese movies.. and so on and on and on. It seemed that the producers began to see 'new ideas' as the devil, so they aimed at secure formulas from old sources!With its joyful atmosphere, new third act, and unfinished ending, the original British movie was an explosive cinematic joke. And when you repeat an old joke, what you'll have is unfunny one. So maybe this Italian Job's makers realized that early; therefore, made totally another thing. But was that thing excellent as a whole? I don't think so!For one reason, the pale cast, or perhaps they're good stars who were so pale in here! (Mark Wahlberg) as (Charlie Croker)?! Com'on! His face had no features to act. And who played that character before?! The honorable Mr. (Michael Caine)! Poor (Wahlberg) was in a real deadlock, especially with his icy performance as the cool (Croker) who was here cool as inanimate or lifeless! (Edward Norton) said once that he hated the part, and just made the movie to terminate his contract with the production company. You can watch him here on the brink of mocking at the traditional role and dialogue. One of these times is so obvious at the restaurant scene. And, for the love of God, aren't both of them, (Wahlberg) and (Norton), so terribly young to be those expert thieves?! Also, I felt pity for (Charlize Theron). What a fake performance she gave!So nearly that entire cast was deadly cold, and by all means director (F. Gary Gray) was the responsible. However, as always, the producers thought that the good action would save the day, forgetting that it wouldn't save EVERY DAY. As if watching (Theron) doing her driving without stunt would compensate for her insipid acting!There is no deep connection with the original; I should say the inspiration instead, except for the plan of stealing gold by breakdown the traffic, and escaping in mini cars. But while the script has a new ball game, with Five Samurai in heist / revenge against an evil guy, the conflict is flat. You know so well that this intolerant, less intelligent, evil guy will be vanquished easily by this confident and creative team, which cracks the movie's foundation, and weakens everything; even the general amusing feel after the viewing. Because one of the 'writing' secrets is in the antagonist's characterization. Feeding him with more power and smartness makes the conflict more hot and attractive. But this script just didn't care about any of that!Nevertheless, it has some fine fun. (Seth Green) was great, stealing the show from the rest. And technically, it's dexterous; all the action is expensively done, and masterly directed, as the only perfect thing in here. But when it comes to the climax, I found myself saying: 'OK, I've seen that before, and it had a spirit too!'.Well, it's an old joke trying to be a new one by adding some slight fresh things; like a different plot, or technical updating, but totally without (The Italian Job - 1969)'s surprise effect, or pristine craziness, which made it more naughty, clever and original. This time, while being fairly entertaining, it's merely another project done with no desire to be extraordinary. I though they shouldn't connect it to the 1969 movie in the first place, that wasn't for the sake of anything but fooling us, and degrading them!It's like the situation between (It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World - 1963) and (Rat Race - 2001), 2 years earlier. Which reminds me; when we'll witness the end of this wearisome rat race of remakes as the biggest, and feeblest, American jobs ever?!",6,0,2,21 September 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I'm The President of (TLOTR)'s Haters Confederation !
","<ul><li>TOO MUCH PROPAGANDA: The continuous annoying importunity for it in newspapers, TV news, Radio news, in the streets, in the magazines, in the people's talking, all right on your ears and eyes to the extent that you'd think it was international hypnosis! So the one who don't even hear bout it; finds himself have no excuse but to love it, even without viewing it?!!</li></ul><ul><li>THE ATMOSPHERE: Love differs from one to another; that's life and that's the world as God already created it. So it's not only conceivable that you love what I hate; it's ordinary, it's certain, it's fate. Therefore, the mythical atmosphere here would be something great for you, and something stupid for else (read: me!). It's sick to bear its characters (tall and short?? I don't care!!), make-up, sets, costumes, and CGI. It's HELL, unbearable repulsive HELL. And all of those unshod people?? Put on shoes or sandals kids, that's not healthy for you!</li></ul><ul><li>THE PLOT: AAAHHHHHHHHH.. What in the world was that anyway??!! I couldn't follow up, or follow out the story. There are some holes and some illogical jumps, and I'm sorry not to go into detail, because I must watch the movie for a second time to show it probably, and that's something that will never happen again. I won't harm myself to that level once more. Not to mention how boring it was; knowing it's an adventure, and knowing how strong my patience is, I really couldn't stand it. I struggled against sleeping too many times, and as much as I was succeeding, I felt violently strangled. So, unlike me, I didn't take notices, having no memory from it afterwards (Yes, it was that painful!). It got no factor to lighten the unsightly everything, not even a relief. Moreover, the last 10 minutes about someone that had been killed, and how all the rest were sad??? Who's that man? And why he died? And why should I care? And if the evil forces took over the world, what would happen more than what we're living already? In one word, if you deem it funny, I deem it so silly, and not even silly in a laughable way!</li></ul><ul><li>THE CAST: I didn't like any of the actors in such roles, conflict, ears! I hated (Liv Tyler)'s too sweet, too soft performance. (Hugo Weaving) was in his worst performance ever. He looked like a parody of any evil character in any old Japanese cartoon series, or Mr. Smith from The Matrix, without the sunglasses. Perhaps (Ian Holm) was the only bearable one.</li></ul><ul><li>The HATEFUL VOICE OF RATIONALITY: Definitely, it was the wish for another kind of action adventure with no comics strip's superheroes, no customary American faces, no nudity, no sexual humor, being a fantasy not sci-fi; as the majority of the movies after Star Wars (1977)--which could abbreviate the whole globe in one conflict between good and evil. It has different satire also about avidity; whereas it makes you crazy, to torture yourself, all the other, and the entire world, then disappear. Thus the totally non-materialistic boy would be the ultimate hero. That's some rare message at that time which apparently attracted a lot of audience even unconsciously.</li></ul><ul><li>THE CONCLUSION: Accordingly, that very formula worked with grand ambition, as well as sincerity, from the side of New Zealand. BUT it's not one world one opinion, and it will never be. So maybe the main music theme and some of the backgrounds drew my attention. However, the whole thing was extremely heavy for me, not amusing at all, and with all the madness over it; it became too obnoxious. Hence, for the above-mentioned reasons, I established the confederation of 'The Lord of The Rings' Haters' to end the state of estrangement among the million of tasteless people who loved it, and to empty our true feelings against such a movie, instead of exploding!</li></ul>",1,1,6,25 May 2008
Grease," Anti-individualism !
","Undoubtedly it has some nice songs, but save them, everything ranges between silly and dumb!Firstly, the slight matters: The 'Beauty School Drop-Out' number was so unrelated to the main story. (Stockard Channing) was 34 year old, so how BY ANY MEAN she was casted as a teen girl in a high school?! The comic situations were uncomic. I was disgusted by its vulgar moments. And the end, oh the end, it can't be weaker where everything gets solved so easily; it's like the writer had no time to write!Now, the important matters: It's another love story between 2 teenagers. OK. He tries to satisfy her by imitating who she pretends to care about (a footballer, for instance). And she doesn't find a solution to get close to him but turning her character from well-dressed, well-mannered, girl into an experienced vamp. So both of them allege something else their nature?!Is it a study of the teen love, or adolescence itself; as a phase of instability where the character doesn't ride at specific anchor unless after many alterations first? Or is it America which was having a phase of adolescence at the time, the 1950s, amongst the changes of post-WW2, and before other changes that would make it more serious and rough? To grasp things rightly; watch carefully the success of the love story here, then its total breakdown at the start of the sequel (Grease 2 - 1982) when (Sandy) leaves (Zuko) for that bright diligent kid (who, also, would undergo a phase where he alleges a personality else his, to attract the girl he likes!). Hence, don't get excited dear viewer with the flashy and dreamy happy ending in (Grease - 1978), because it's mainly a movie about changes, the age of changes and the time of changes as well, and it's, as a movie, so glad and proud of what it talks about.The thing is it comes with (Animal House), produced in the same year, to triumph for the lazy kids, who study nothing. And, on the other hand, glorify giving up your own self to be the formed type, agreeing with the known figure, even if you're not content with it, just to be a la mode! So, accordingly, (Grease) could be the most colorful and loud anti-individualism movie ever made. And that's why I don't feel comfortable with it, specifically while the 2 leads surrendering to satisfy the people at the end, instead of facing all of them with their true nature. It's where the movie itself surrenders to this adolescent thinking to the extent of asking yourself, after the end of part 2, does the lead love that bright kid indeed? Or she'll going to leave him for any other later?! (You can ask the same question about him too!). And it's an ordinary question pursuant to the brought up logic in the movie: live your 'adolescence' in full, with all the senses of the word!Furthermore, I hated the endless obscene sexual talk. It seems like the dialogue has it, and has nothing but it. It was just filthy teens' conversations, given freely, where the one and only thing to think, talk, and joke about is sex (masturbation, group sex, love bites.. etc). It disturbed me highly, noticing that I was watching what's supposed to be a romantic comedy. However, maybe the secret of (Grease)'s massive success back in the day is being that 'rebel' among the legacy of Hollywood musical romantic comedies; to be the movie which expressed these meanings of uncertainty, the frank adolescent love of the formed type, or the pop image, plus the nakedly obscene showing of some of that generation's talking and thinking.Long story short, that was a hit in 1978, and it is for many others; knowing that it was one of the people's choices for the best 100 movies in the 20th century, in a 1999 issue of Empire magazine, yet it isn't - at any time - that hit for me. As you see, unlike the movie's leads, I'm not shy of my individuality!",Null,3,8,26 October 2010
Armageddon," Some Questions, and Answers Too !
","I was watching this with my relatives as a rented video. And in one moment of pure truth, my cousin asked us all as we were in the middle of it: 'Does Anybody Want THIS anymore?!' To have all of us crying: 'NOOOO!' However, I watched all of it afterwards, and what a painful experience I had!I asked my friend once: 'What did Michael Bay want by making his movie like this?!', and he answered so logically: 'He wanted to make all the audience blind and deaf'. Enough said!Why the acting of (Ben Affleck) is that bad? And how could he make even more movies? Well, I have heard the great late (Vincente Minnelli) saying once in an old TV interview: 'Not every star should be a good actor!'What is that anyway? It looked sometimes like a mix of (The Dirty Dozen) and (Independence Day), but as a long, so stupid, video clip!This movie was in the audience's list for the best 100 movie in the history of cinema published by Empire magazine in October 1999. Yes, it's true as number 79 in the list, but at the same issue, there was the audience's list for the worst 10 movies ever, and guess what movie was there also?!! Yes my dear friends, this very piece of work was one of the 100 best and one of the 10 worst too!Honestly, I have asked myself once: What were the most beautiful things in such a movie? And my answer was: the voice of (Charlton Heston) at the beginning, the presence of (Liv Tyler), and the fact that I'll never watch that Hollywood's huge nonsense ever again. Though, I'll watch other Hollywood's huge nonsense again.. But NOT THIS ONE!",5,0,3,15 August 2007
The Village," Weak & Alleged !
","OH MY GOD! They told me that this was an excellent movie from Hollywood. They told me that this was (M. Night Shyamalan)'s masterpiece. They told me that it was a hit. Well, they never told me that they, themselves, were so dumb!This is without a doubt the worst of (Shyamalan)'s suspenseful pieces yet. (The Sixth Sense - 1999) was good but for one watching, (Unbreakable - 2000) was breakable but artistically, (Signs - 2002) despite its fine meaning it was a (The War of The World)'s rip-off, then (The Village - 2004) is the most alleged and the less entertaining.At first, some stupid detached scenes like it's a French New Wave film. Then a childish horror movie. Then a thought-provoking twist to see how there is some idea about fear which delays or retards a community. Then (Shyamalan) thinks the unthinkable, to make what's very new, so let's give them another twist; it's not happening in the old times, it's our own days, and the seniors are nothing but a bunch of university graduates or professors who wanted once to build Utopia. So, at the end, it's the beginning of the revolution to make this community maybe more utopian. The way of making this manufactured a real icon among all the celebrated nonsense in the commercial American movies lately. At least (Mystic River - 2003) was highly overrated already though not nonsense, and (Spiderman - 2002) was the top of silliness, however it didn't allege anything!You may strive strong feelings of boredom by saying 'HEY, it's unusual. Give it a chance. It's some oddity. Novelty. Different'. BUT when it grows on, you would hate it, its makers, and yourself also for respecting such a work. It didn't deserve it, for instance: (Shyamalan) irritatingly makes the first 40 minutes as quiet as possible, in the lowest tone, to surprise us with the sudden appearance of the monsters. In fact, it could've been masterly done if this horror sequence was effective enough, or that the previous sequence was deeply enough, such as its like in (Alfred Hitchcock)'s (The Birds - 1963). However, the whole trick, rather the whole movie, sunk!All the thrilling moments were primitive. There was no good acting, since there were no good roles. It didn't have convincing catchy characters, brilliant hot conflict, or dexterous profound meanings. This script just incapacitated its idea and its atmosphere into foolish treatment to turn out to be boring, assuming, and idiotically made. In one word, there is no horror, or else!Moreover: How those people managed to separate this village from the whole world? How did they build it in the first place? How they got all of that old costumes, sets, and equipments? Why the father left his own blind daughter into the forest alone? Why he didn't go with her as long as there was no ghost but himself?? And that last sequence.. OHHH when Mr. (Shyamalan) himself plays the big sheriff who warns his deputy, as if the writer, director, producer gives us a bonus: a symbolically political satire! As he refers maybe to how the bigger society could be ruled by authority that owns the knowledge for itself, and makes all the people busy with fake ghosts, for achieving a hidden agenda. Remember bombing Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan after one week of Monica-gate, or claiming the presence of nuclear weapons in Iraq for controlling it and its petroleum,.. etc. It can be well-meaning movie, but in the worst way ever!I didn't find anything here to enjoy. Maybe (Bryce Dallas Howard)'s wonderful smile. I liked only the sound of her laughter since I don't deem any performance as something useful in this movie. What's the use of great machines in a deactivated factory? Not to mention, how honorable actors like (Brendan Gleeson) or (Sigourney Weaver) looked so naive or deceived in a dead drama like this? (William Hurt) seemed so imbecile, particularly at his last 4 scenes; like he was doing a Shakespearean play in a nursery school's stage!So in this kind of work, you'd never notice why the progeny of this fear was whether a mentally-handicapped, or blind, or teenager anyway, because (M. Night Shyamalan), its very much creator, was its very much killer. To be all eventually a comedy, like the scene of the blind girl and the patrol, or a black comedy indeed about killing your own idea, making an idiot movie, and to be loved by millions of idiots in the same time as well!Sorry, I hate to watch a bad movie, I hate it more when it got promising idea, and I hate it to the utmost when it alleges high meanings ridiculously.",1,1,3,25 May 2008
21," Find 10 similarities between Jim Sturgess and.. Droopy !
","Along the years, England had given the world a long list of great exports. Charles Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Harry Potter! Now the gent named Jim Sturgess doesn't belong to this list at all. In fact, due to him.. England should be ashamed of herself!When you have an actor who doesn't act well, then it's a problem. But when you have an actor who doesn't act well in a movie, where all the actors along with everything else are very well, then it's a bigger problem!This is a smart movie. I loved the way its narrative works. It follows, to great extent, the pattern of Oliver Stone's Wall Street, but mastered having its own merits. It is about wicked manipulating, once on Vegas casinos, then once more on the impostor teacher and us as viewers (the end's twist). The real wickedness is in how that is told; through the lead while talking about experiences that he had while being in his early twenties. To assure that, see how the old experience of the casino's head of security could beat the scientific cunning, or how the impostor teacher - imprisoned in his classroom, hotel rooms, and theories - is the one who loses eventually. So, having an experience, by wading into practical life, has unmistakable glorification.The script makes a nagging boss for that security man, not to thrill by secondary conflict, but to underline the message of 'your computer can't do this'. The complicated mathematics, and the huge very advanced electronic minds, all can be defeated in this movie by the human wit. Human relationships are being defended too, since the lead discovers that his friends are more significant than money and business. While glorifying the human experience, intelligence, the movie's substance glorifies, and has victory for, the human in general against a world of machinery and pure materialism.It seems perfect as fun ride with tight pace, many surprises, colorful image, a very happy end where everybody wins, and the evil goes to hell. So as a whole, this is smart and enjoyable as well. However, there was a love scene that I thought was unnecessary as the heroine herself. And.. there was Mr. Sturgess!That guy was an obvious dissonant tone. Between Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne, he seemed like Droopy in Tom and Jerry Kids show. And while being the lead actor, it was even worse than that Tom and Jerry show!Seriously speaking, he's as sleepy as Droopy, and less fun than him; remember the moment where he was making faces in front of a mirror; it's one of the most AWFUL scenes I have ever seen in a Hollywood movie lately! At another moment, he tells, ironically, that he's used to be mistaken for Tom Cruise. Baby, one look at you made me finally discover how I underrated Cruise as an actor for ages!Save the sole thing he mastered, a flawless American accent, Sturgess was undoubtedly a flaw in this movie. He looks all-the-time stoned, or totally indifferent at best. With his pale charisma and monotonous utterance, I don't know how he is chosen to be in this movie or any movie for that matter. Sturgess' character availed a lot of his 2 mentors in the movie, played by Spacey and Fishburne, unlike Sturgess himself with these 2 acting mentors I suppose!21 is a memorable commercial movie about brilliant swindle done with another brilliant swindle, which could produce a meaning about growing up. It gives '21' a peculiar double meaning and good reputation in terms of being the right age to learn about life. And it portrays, in a way, how 'slick' overpowers 'genius', 'friendship' overpowers 'business', and 'man' overpowers 'machine'. Its sole problem isn't in the lifeless Jim Sturgess, it's rather in the weird decision of casting him, being a stupid move in a movie full of smartness.If whoever manages the process of casting doesn't know how to perfect their job, then, my advice will be for Sturgess himself: dear jimmy, for the love of god, your homeland England, its repute, and the poor us. Before handling your next movie, try to have a good, really good, deal of sleep. Then, after being so awake and fresh, please, think of another possible career or.. continue sleeping!",Null,0,1,2 December 2011
Little Miss Sunshine," 'America is Beautiful' But 'Why Everybody is Upset' ?!
","I don't think it's a great movie, but it has some interesting points. The bunch of characters is mostly expressive. They all live a depression. Their dreams aren't achieved. And their connections with each other are nearly dead. It doesn't want to be a big picture for a nation. It just wants to put all the losers in one mission for winning a small dream. And the greater good that happens is by gathering them really with each other, because love is the best winning at all. So, what's wrong about it?It's a road movie, with nice sad characters, and kind of good black comedy. It has lovely moments and innocent goal. What it needed to have was more than the superficial dealing sometimes. For instance, the wife looks overlooked?! I didn't catch on clearly what were her problems with her husband. Plus I couldn't understand Grandpa, despite how dazzling Alan Arkin's performance always is. It needed also coherent endings for the storylines, and sure anyone but Greg Kinnear; the guy was the lowest player, with other actor that could've been more deep and memorable role.I loved the sequence of the beauty contest; the monstrous kids' look said a lot about a society that masters creating monsters. The way how the car was running, tells symbolically about wrecked life that must be caught anyway, most importantly with the family. Look at the last dance; where love is the actual and eternal beauty queen. Toni Collette is a ruby, she's one of the best actresses, how can any artiest be more believable?, just her role's writing bugged me. As you see, the movie has much potential, but did that script grasp and utilize them all?!Haven't you noticed that the movie's characters have nothing to do with spirituality, where drugs and perversion are loose, or how their pop culture is destructive; so the kid is crazy about outward beauty, or how this is inwardly deformed society altogether? Well, you might notice, but not watch and feel. Because (Little Miss Sunshine) is a feel good movie after all. So the question of my title, which's 2 separate lines from the movie's dialogue, wasn't answered, or maybe was intended to be answered. Yes, being about a reunion of ugly upset American family; can be an enough social commentary about its era. Reading, and not exploring, can be useful sometimes. The thing about this movie is that it reads, without that intention to explore. So it isn't a great movie in my book. A light one about great matters maybe.",Null,0,2,9 July 2010
Knowing," Feel Hoaxed?, Depressed?, or Like Someone Finished a Bad Movie?.. Then Read This !
","Few times in my life I felt that I need to scream right in the movies. The 'Get me out of here' symptoms attacked me this time outrageously. So let's take it step by step. It starts like a fine X File. Actually, the first 3/4 of the movie is such a solid and attractive paranormal thriller. But after that, well.. you can say totally confident that the disaster hit it BADLY!I can't forget the climactic sequence where our dear terrestrial globe got wholly exploded!!! Psychologically speaking, I felt that the movie's makers are desperate ones, having some hard problems in their life, so they had to make a movie that ends this world, and starts sweeter and happier new one! Or maybe, on the contrary, they lead a pretty restful life, and had to destroy the world for the poor us to make some money!Anyway, it's an excellent movie till its end. The performance was fabulous; I've never seen Cage that deep - like in the lecture scene - unless too scarcely. Though, that wasn't the right movie to experience that well, or to relish it that long. The real outstanding accomplishment ever done by this movie was its music. It's a complete enjoyment to feel how eccentric and eerie the way it carried out the events. It's so horrific at places, expressing perfectly the story's oddity and obscurity, and presaging its ominous end as well. Alex Proyas's direction, with or without the master scene of the falling plane, was catchy enough. The pre-end scenes, with hundreds of extras, are a sign of extraordinary director. In fact, movies like (Dark City - 1998) or (I, Robot - 2004) might have problems, but still Proyas's direction is a mark of proficiency, and undoubtedly one of their best points if not the best. Which leads us to (Knowing)'s WORST points.Simply, what this movie is about? It's obviously about Knowing, no less, no more. Knowing the fact about this universe as a wholly strictly systematic entity, where there is one mighty power that controls everything and everyone; previously and impeccably. So that's why the Quran refers to God as 'the Knower of the Unseen'. And all what this movie says is that man can't change a bit in this completed destiny already, even if he knew beforehand what's hidden or unseen. It's a profound faith message, but expressed in a bad way I suppose!First of all, we watched a father who couldn't stop any of the 3 disastrous prophecies. Instead, he got to believe satisfyingly in the higher power, and its wisdom, even if it predestined the death of his wife, the ultimate decampment of his son, then his own death with the rest of the world too. So we all have the incapacity of switching anything of what's written, or what God have already decided, only the capacity of searching for the truth and, as this movie shows, believing in destiny whatever the case may be. However, the movie didn't implant carefully these lovely meanings earlier or extensively, presenting to us a thriller that, at best, would make us enjoy our times with another paranormal case, while it's utterly not. That makes you feel tricked eventually, let alone give you an effective depressing feel after, causing the 'Get me out of here' symptoms; as if it's a thriller with awfully unhappy end, because it sated, like any other thriller, the suspenseful atmosphere smartly, while it didn't do the same with its different high meaning.Secondly, the reaction of Cage's father when he knows about the possibility of his town's destruction saying: 'If god needed me, I'm Ready!!'. This is goofy; as a suicide more than faith on one hand, and as a way to embody the conflict between science (Cage as biology teacher) and religion (the father as a priest) on the other hand.Thirdly, minor points. I mean Cage's character finds everything so plainly and quickly to a strange extent. For instance, he merely used the internet to find ALL the accidents of the twentieth century, in FULL details! Or how he gets all the earth's longitudes and latitudes by a small device which it happens that he owns one! Moreover, the fatuous CGI that made the train vaporize the people in the subway's accident! Or the scene in which the kid is writing unconsciously another series of disasters!! How is that since the world is about detonation anyway??!! Not to mention, one naively-made scene, where the divine creatures transport the 2 children to the other land. For one thing, its imagination wasn't that different from Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and for another, I don't think that these ethereal creatures, that disguise in human bodies, got bottoms after taking off these very bodies! And finally, the movie makers' conviction about angels that choose many young Adams and Eves for a new world is beyond me.Years from now, I know, a lot of reviews will talk and talk about how this movie was misunderstood, how it's a lost gem. But for me, it's just a try to say something great in another thriller. However, that try wasn't harmonious, satisfactory or great itself.",6,0,2,21 June 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Talk To The Hand !
","Remember guys, not everything is as it seems.The atmosphere is fine for pure action; I didn't see anything serious or catchy as a sci-fi. The worst of it was the easy repetition of the Terminator's plot: a hunted human with super assistant, a super hunter, and a hunt through the city. It's nearly the second one again, however with a lady cyborg this time. Which's cool and modern. But made it so predictable, and transformed the whole matter into slasher movie with big explosions!The whole unseen-story about the end of the world has gone too far, too complicated, and too exploited! Originally the matter of the doomsday in 1999 as false happening is truly laughable, and such a disgrace to the first 2 movies. The climax wasn't up to what preceded it. The CGI was good, but for sure not a milestone like the sequel of 1992. Director (Jonathan Mostow) makes good 'noisiness' along the way, with nothing more to offer.Despite looking a bit weary and old, (Arnold Schwarzenegger) hands in nice performance, but as just a funny take on his persona from the previous 2 movies. (Nick Stahl) is annoying as John Connor (could it mean that the future leaders would be boring?!). (Claire Danes) is great, but with no great thing to do. And I HATED the nudity; it's the way how Hollywood movies are sold since 1968, and I just HATE that!I liked the way (Arnie)'s trade mark 'I'll Be Back' had been handled without hackneying ('I'm back', 'she'll be back',.. smart!), still the Terminator's gags are the most enjoyable moments in here.I recall well that at the time of its release, it was one of the most smuggled movies ever; managing to be a rented videotape, near my house, while it was in cinemas, or even before that! Also, its IMDb first rating was something like 9,8!! That what made me learn about the IMDb's ratings as not always the golden truth, hence nothing is as it seems. Btw, after 6 years, it's now 6,7.. Would fairness win eventually?All in all, it's fair action, with funny moments, but don't wait for more even in terms of imagination. Otherwise, Talk To The Hand!",6,0,1,20 February 2009
The Shining," Just Too Much !
","Some movies gained over-hyped fame and so many praising epithets along the years to an extent that makes discussing them a kind of blasphemy!(The Shining) is one of these movies. It embodies the blind glorification at its best. But I won't be terrified. So.. Let's blaspheme!This movie has a clear problem. It wants to say a lot in the same time. After 3 viewings, I couldn't settle what the main theme was? There is a writer who can't write. A shining thing between his little kid and the old guard. A hunted house with ghosts. Maybe a satirical message; with the 'hotel' that was built over red Indians' cemetery, the maze, and the presence of the American flag which could aim at America and its end as bankrupt crazy frozen??Moreover, there are twin silent sisters (?), beauty that turns into corpse (life ends fast isn't it?!), a kid who repeats one word backwards (may god help him), and a bear having sex with a man at the end (a thing that provoked me to the MAX!). And finally, a reference, at the last shot, to a transmigration of souls??!! This is too much already!Plainly, whatever Kubrick forced of high issues, and ciphers to express them, seemed inharmonic, complicated the movie, and chopped off any simple drama - or drama - it had, along with any coherent one meaning.It looks too artistic; which differentiates it between any usual horror. But what this quality did further than making it visually polished?! Most of the classic tracks were shockingly boring. The movie is long. Ahh, this is to contemplate. But what was there, and solid, to be concluded?! The performance, especially from the kid's side, was laughable yet shown as extremely serious, so it was scary enough! Generally, when a movie achieves this degree of being not understood, and not enjoyable, then this is failure. And with commendable novel, and one of a kind director, then this is turkey!I believe that (Stanley Kubrick) got conceited as he aged. Look at his late movies to understand that well. Just read this: 'Stanley Kubrick ordered more than 120 takes in the scene where the camera simply slowly zooms in on Scatman Crothers as he 'shines' in his bedroom. Kubrick wanted approximately 70 takes of the scene where Halloran gets killed by Jack Torrance, but Jack Nicholson talked Kubrick into going easy on the 70-year-old Crothers and stopping after 40. At one point, during the filming, Crothers became so exasperated with Kubrick's notorious, compulsive style of excessive retakes that he broke down and cried, asking: 'What do you want, Mr. Kubrick?!!', Ok, I have no idea what (Kubrick) wanted. And this confusing question can fit for the whole movie as well!Strangely, among this heavy mix and this bad ego, the movie managed to be scary. Its general dark character, unfamiliar artistic taste, with Nicholson's charismatic madness made it an exceptional horror. Then its forever vagueness gave it a certain magic. Millions think that Comprehensible + Kubrick = deep stuff, high art, and most of all: something can't be criticized! In fact, being mixed up, long, overstuffed, perfectly ambiguous, not to mention 'Kubrick's' left all the chances in the world so the die-hard fans could put their own explanations in the large empty spaces, making up disparate, or rather desperate, theories. However, none of them would ever have the ability to connect all of the movie's mishmash. See how this movie's faults are big part of the very reason why it's cult classic!It's nothing but a lost movie in the maze of its director's very own viewpoints towards many issues. (Kubrick) kept mixing a lot of constituents till the final product became just like the movie's hotel: huge and blank, with different ghosts and unexplained everything!Too much of something is bad enough. So how about too much of many things!",2,0,2,20 November 2009
BASEketball," The American Hamburger when it Catches The Mad Cow Disease !
","Supposedly (David Zucker) is one of my favorites. His name was over so many so good comedies whether as a writer, director, or producer, such as (Airplane! - 1980), (Top Secret! - 1984), (The Naked Gun's series - 1988, 1991, 1994), (Brain Donors - 1992), or even (High School High - 1996). But the fact of him being the writer, director and producer of (BASEketball - 1998) is totally a disaster; it's the worst of him till 1998!The basic factor to make you laugh here was the assumption that all the characters is gay, sexually gay. Look closer to understand the very easy method; starting from (Ernest Borgnine), to the silly sidekick, ending with the 2 leads themselves having a sickening kiss (even the cameo of Robert Stack!). This tone isn't the only truly nasty thing. In fact, the whole movie tries to be as die-hard dirty as it can be. And I just can't get it. Why to be dirty in the first place? Why addressing the animalistic side in the human, enjoying showing perverted people and matters, smashing art, ethics, and good taste all at once? These comedies assure something rotten with the moviemakers, and bring no less rottenness to the culture. At any rate, I don't accept dumping their trash into my brain!The sad matter is not my own annoyance out of the name of a gifted artist being on detestable work like this, but also because the main idea was so smart in its core. The BASEketball sport could've been something creative, especially with the witty satire against the media or the sport industry, but the movie was dead set to not think at all while it deals with thoughtful issues. It was a good idea, however everything else was way lower. This movie doesn't know what it wants to be exactly: a buddy-comedy in the era of post-(Dumb & Dumber - 1994), a cartoony farce, a satire about the sport world. It managed eventually to be something too zany to stand, and too nasty to be droll.Save (Robert Vaughn), who I've never imagined that I would like him one day and through a comedy, the performance was totally obnoxious. For little example, (Dian Bachar) as (Squeak) was unbearable to the extent that I hated every second he was in. (Trey Parker) looks terrible in this long yellow hair, and (Matt Stone) seems repugnant more than funny to say the least; actually, both as the leads were between weak and average. (Yasmine Bleeth) looked stray; they didn't try to make a laugh out of her ever. I think she's one of the real stars that were never given the chance to be a 'real star', and she'll live the rest of her life appearing in TV movies, shows, or idiot movies like this one. It gets on your nerve badly when you watch the movie's posters, and find no presence for her at all. They put (Jenny McCarthy) instead??!!Overall, there is a hilarious spirit, but the comedy doesn't hit the mark much. The real good parts are few and swift. The details in the background, like (Airplane) previously, weren't well-made, or made in the first place, it's some sign that this comedy was brain-dead itself. If the main point was making a vulgar, squalid, and emetic comedy, then (Zucker) succeeded. Here's what I wrote right after the viewing: 'This is paltry, crazy, and sick like a hamburger that caught the mad cow disease'!",1,2,6,19 February 2009
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Better than the first, with its main problem !
","The 2 movies of Madagascar are nice for many reasons. The cute characters; my favorites are the lion and - of course - the secret agent penguins. The colorful refreshing drawings. The vociferous animation is perfect; Alex's movement is unbelievably vivid, and one of the closest 3D image to the crazy cartoons. And the soundtrack is happy. In fact, these 2 movies have only one problem.I'm talking about the script. The first had its luckless share of it. Now the second is better altogether. Besides spacious cadres, more action, there is sure much smarter script. It provides a solid conflict, reconciliation, and love stories. It's more than noticeable how it fixes the first's flaw when it forgot all about Melman and Gloria since its second half. And this time, finally, the penguins *can* successfully plan, rightly drive, and seriously invent. So compared to the first, it's full of memorable motion and emotions indeed. Though, while being less flawed, it's not completely the best either. It does lack many points.The comedy is dry. For instance, I didn't get the monkey's jokes, or love the end's marriage (between a penguin and a doll?!), and I suffered from every single second that had the 'King' talking! The energetic parody's spirit is gone, you can recognize merely one swift spoof based on West Side Story. The whole character of the old woman was so unfunny, and annoying. Let alone her perfectly forced storyline: How come Newyorkers live in the jungle like natives? How come water disappears due to a dam they built? How they built it in the first place? How come that that lady fights the leads violently?!! Obviously, this movie missed appropriate antagonist, for its third act, badly!It's better than the first, yet with its exact problem. The script, as a problem, became something I ran into endlessly lately when it regards American movies!P.S: In this movie, Alex lived in the wild with his family for quite some time. So how nobody noticed that he eats fish instead of meat? This is just a question with mala fides, aiming at the worst point in the first movie!",Null,0,0,22 November 2011
Salt," Smart thriller it ain't !
","You know the worst thing about such a movie? It's its beautiful directing. (Phillip Noyce) made one solid piece of cinema. The image, the editing, the music.. Just WAW. He seemed haunted by the best spy thrillers in the 1960s. The movie looks accordingly huge and grand. So how come that this is a bad thing? In fact, the script it handled let it huge and grand on the surface, small and embarrassed in the substance!I admit that the integration's scene at the CIA, put in the trailer and in the movie's start, is just impressive. It promises of smart thriller. The rest smashes this promise into pieces. How many questions were allowed to be asked?! Well, take a list: If Slat is a Russian spy, why to inform the Americans, and by the most risky way ever?! The movie answers that, flimsily, by the Russians' need to a patsy?!! So if Salt is a patsy, why to continue executing operations for whoever deals with her as a patsy? Why not confessing to anyone as long as she became an exposed card already? Why her Russian superiors didn't eliminate her earlier?! It was the top of oddity when Salt pays Orlov a visit later, and tells him about his aging, and not a word about 'Why did you inform about me?!!!' Then, if she killed all the Russian organization OF WELL TRAINED ASSASSINS (what an unbelievable scene!), then how in god's name the matter wasn't known to the loose guys of the same organization, like the officer who provided the entrance to the white house, and Mr. main spy?!Add to that, several marks of cheap goods: provocative coincidences; the Russian politician is alive, exactly in the middle of the world's end?! Uncanny points: Why Salt, in her daily life in America, wears contact lens along with fake teeth?! More than that: How come? Did her husband never notice?! Idiot assuming all the time; nobody sees Salt while getting out of the crashed car under the daylight, in the street's center stage! Stupid casting: the American president looked like a silent dummy. Forced moves; salt takes off her panties to block up the CIA surveillance camera, while her jacket was available and - sure - bigger in size! Yet nothing bothered me more than the fabricated happy ending; it took Salt 1 minute chat, and 2 'You Know Betterrr!' to convince the CIA agent that she's a Russian spy and good guy in the same time, he got too convinced to the extent that he helped her to escape???!!! By the way, how the helicopter's door got dislocated while that?!! Don't answer this! And finally, aren't Russia, nuclear bomb, soviet spies-old memories from the 1980s? It seemed that the movie was written at least 20 years earlier then got made, very late, without any modifications!(Angelina Jolie) assured that her little mannish face is iconic and expressive, but alas, that was in the wrong place somehow. Look how she begs the creditability at many scenes, since the written material didn't give her any. Look how she's boringly unbeatable. And look at her disguise as a man; it was one of the weirdest at all!Not some, but all of the action sequences are done superbly. The stunt of jumping over a bridge to a lorry, then to another lorry, did dazzle me particularly. Overall, this movie is a feast of old-fashioned action, something we truly miss in a world of overabundant CGI, and silly flying wires. On the other hand, while being majestic and effective, the music couldn't compensate the lost credibility, rather, it was great long shot.. for emptiness!It reminds me with a story of a man who went to camping in the wild, with everything might be needed, however after facing the bear, and while being eaten by it, he remembered forgetting a gun. Now (Salt) forgot the factor that could have saved it from being unbelievable nonsense. It's the factor that many Hollywood movies do forget lately: the script. They think that by playing the movie very fast and confident, nobody would notice anything. But being fast and confident didn't save the camping man from his dark fate!(Salt) is smart thriller visually and sonically, but not mentally. A rare time, and a painful irony, when the 'leave your brain at the door' movie is tightly made and annoyingly brainless like this.P.S: The movie was released in theaters in 100 minutes long. However, the director's cut is released with 4 minutes longer, including an alternative ending. So, should I yell HURRAY, dancing out of joy?! No, based on that tricky mode recently, of selling the same movie twice, I find no comment but 'I DON'T CARE!'.",6,0,3,23 November 2011
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," A comedy that made me sad !
","The idea was spoofing many singers' bio-pics and lives, especially after a string of musical bio-pics within a few years earlier like Beyond the Sea (2004), Ray (2004), and Walk the Line (2005). Well, it sounds tempting. And I have to admit; the trailer got me. But regrettably, it was ugly. So abysmally ugly!First of all, John C. Reilly, who's a very good actor, looks incredibly ugly, if not scary, as the title character. There was a love scene for him that I suffered from, and couldn't even understand, where he was totally unfunny, and with slow pace, no music, and low-angle--turned into killer horror! Throughout the whole movie, he does nothing laughable, and seems really cheap. By the way, don't try to search for anyone else. Save Reilly, the rest are cameos.Comedy means smartness. A rule that this movie never heard of. Therefore its writers chose the ultimate easy solution; which is filth, disappointing every attempt to write a good situation or dialogue, resorting - instead - to absolute dirtiness that any mean adolescent could create, and while immersing into it, the whole movie turned into mean adolescent itself!Actually, the script is jammed with many kinds of filth. Filthy jokes, filthy images, and even filthy meanings. For instance, the matter of addicting different drugs along the years exceeded being a running gag, to be some sort of drugs' glorification, as if no genius or success can be reached without them. This is not a parody inasmuch as publicity!I really got fed up with movies that have nearly nothing but swearing, nudity, and drugs, while presenting themselves as comedies. These are crimes more than fun. 'Rated R for sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and language' will transform movies into hard porn, if hasn't done that already! It's clear that Hollywood in the last decades drives us to obtain entertainment from sewers, addressing dreadfully an animalistic side in us.So as a comedy, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story didn't make me laugh. It did make me abhor. And as a comedy from Hollywood lately, it's another monster disguised as a pet. It's not a movie for me. It's a repulsive toilet, where nobody cared to flush once, to make an audience of repulsive toilets as well. The thing is, if I wanted something else, it's no where to be seen. Because big percentage of Hollywood comedies nowadays became trashy, or frank trash. And anyone with an atom of brain, or sensitivity, must flee to the old comedies, where intelligence, respect, and human were still part of the mix. For me, their worst is better than those saddening contemporary comedies.",1,2,12,6 May 2016
Disturbia," My First Time to Cheer On The Evil Guy !
","It's not the worst movie ever made. It's one of the worst movies ever made. And I have my reasons.Original: This is Rear Window meets Columbo meets MacGyver meets Mission Impossible meets Poltergeist meets American Beauty meets Dracula (I hoped for Dracula to come soon and get rid of the 3 leads!).Cleverly acted: (Aaron Yoo) as (Ronnie) was the gayest portrayal for non-gay person in the history of cinema. Let alone how this human was a complete BAD JOKE; from the terrible actor he is, to the worst sidekick he did!'She's Alive, She's Alive!': (Sarah Roemer) doesn't have the talent; I can stand the electric chair, but not her again. And she doesn't have the spirit; she oozes silliness all the way. So her appearances were truly hurting my soul. I don't know how anybody in the world may fall for her like that?!Emotional: The monologue that (Shia LaBeouf) says about the things that he loves about his girl was absolute A-level nonsense from start to finish. Something was deeply wrong in the acting, in the directing, in the writing, or with the 3 of them. For instance, both of the actors don't know how to act or to convince, the directing was extremely low, and the 'How am I?' line was super provocative!Suspenseful, Logical and Unpredictable: What a clumsy script. The whole thing was nothing but empty circle that hands in to another. The word 'thriller' just doesn't apply to most of the events. And the rest has some of the most dumb, unexplained and weak events; aside from full video security system and such an expensive other devices, (Shia LaBeouf) got the blueprints of his neighbor's house before and after the modifications? (maybe he's an underage undercover CIA agent!), his desperately dullard friend loses his cell phone then brings it back just like that? (Maybe he's a magician!), the killer lost it and wanted it to kill them all (how to hide all of this mess?!), (LaBeouf) finds a wig in (David Morse)'s flat, then whispers terrified: 'The girl never left!', so did (Morse) get to wear a long wig and a woman dress, faking his victim's leaving?? (Well, I couldn't care less!), and finally here's this guy, killing half of the city's women, living in the same city, while having the same suspected, so rare, car, and nobody ever doubted him?? (maybe he's a character in a bad Hollywood movie!). Just forget all of that, and think mainly how this movie made it so impossible for us to guess who the killer was!Fast-Paced: The shoddy dealing with the lead's flat, the awfulness of the acting, and the ACTORS, the easiness of the story, then the repellent *unbelievable* romantic story within the main story, all of that destroyed the movie's character as a thriller, and created a pure sense of bore. To tell you the truth, for ¾ of the movie, I felt the tedium as a train coming out of the screen to hit me. After the Action Thriller, the Horror Thriller, and the Psychological Thriller, (Disturbia) puts a new kind of thriller indeed; The Boring Thriller!Thoughtful: Why not to make a better twist at the end? Say, for instance, that these guys were after the wrong neighbor all along. Say, for another, that they'd be all proved wrong at the end; being deluded by their incredibly empty time, paranoid and dull to the extent of imagining a fake tale about their beloved neighbor, where there was no killer in this suburbia at all. That would have been more suitable, or at least less predictable than the idiocy that I watched where the lead kills the killer and wins the girl. By the way, I'm so sure that the audience applauded crazily in the theaters by that moment, not out of being happy that the good won, but because they would finally go home!Disappointing: I wished all the time that these guys go to jail, be killed,.. etc. but no such luck. I was cheering up the evil guy to finish them, but he was that feeble to get beaten and by the hands of (Shia LaBeouf)!Any Good?: I won't forgive myself for this, but the best things about this movie were its first 15 minutes, the shot in which the lead and Gwyneth Paltrow's younger unbearable sister jumped from a roof to a swimming pool, and the fact that I didn't watch it in cinema; I know that it could have had small shocks there, with the Dolby sound effects and music. But of course, after experiencing it only on TV, I feel SO LUCKYYYYYYYYYY!Forever!: (Steven Spielberg) believes in (LaBeouf) as great upcoming star. According to what I watched for him so far, I don't. So why we had to be tortured in the way?!! While (Spielberg), as the executive producer of this trash, loves a line from it that says: 'Operation Stupid is officially over', sorrowfully a lot of innocent people will run into this movie on TV or else, to suffer watching it again; so the bigger 'Operation Stupid' won't be officially over. However, and thank God, it is for me!Finally a Question: Does the lead's friend (Ronnie) die? OK. I think it can be figured out that he really died since they were celebrating at the end!",Null,0,0,19 February 2010
Van Helsing," Too Much of CGI, Too Less of Everything !
","Unlike good nonsense like (Speed - 1994), and bad nonsense like (Armageddon - 1998), this is the average of the popular trend that we used to receive from the American cinema since the start of the 1990s.Since James Cameron's (Terminator 2: Judgment Day - 1991), then Steven Spielberg's (Jurassic Park - 1993), the CGI, as the latest revolution in the cinematic special effects, established a unique personality in the action movie making. It became common to have movies with CGI that could make it or overkill it. (Stephen Sommers), as a writer and director, used to dazzle us by unbelievable unstoppable action all the time with the powers of that new magic. But, here, simply something had prevailed in some things.(Sommers) was determined to beat the record of the CGI's shots in films, watch (The Mummy Returns - 2001) to catch on that, and marvelously after 2 years of hard working, he did it. Undeniably, (Van Helsing) exceeded all its antecedents, and reached to nearly 2000 shots of CGI. Is it good? Yes, if you're a historian of special effects, or a die hard fan of CGI, because after watching this movie you might not love this fact that much!Actually, not the 'too much of something is bad enough' matter only that has to bother you while watching, there are another matters: the script just lacks and lacks and lacks. Expressly it could've been fine for any of (Sommers)'s movies, but the overabundance of CGI made it totally unbalanced, unlike the way it was in his more perfect work (The Mummy - 1999). Yes, he accumulated the exposition scenes, all in small detached pieces, as he and all the action's makers now usually do, but in front of this choppy ocean of visual and sonic clamor; the plot, any plot, must look too thin and too weak, or let's say invisible. As if every scene, that has one event and couple of lines, is thrown into comic book in the size of playground!I hate to watch a respectable star such as (Hugh Jackman), who CAN act, in this empty role, where all what he has to do is: jumping, looking mean to the evil guys, and transforming into cartoonish generated graphic occasionally. Ironically, (Sommers) was so lucky this time to work with a star else the kind of his previous heroes like (Treat Williams) or (Brendan Fraser), however (Sommers) imprisoned (Jackman) unproductively in this mammoth hubbub. The lesion is deeper when (Sommers) even wrote less funny lines, or any lines, for (Jackman) also, to be finally just unexciting image.Even (Kevin J. O'Connor) in the role 'that had been written especially for him' looks utterly miscast. The role gave him nothing. In fact, this is not a role or a cameo in the first place. And you'll be more provoked when his very much role, (Carl the sidekick), goes to the unfunny (David Wenham). So the sad result: there is no relief in here. It assured that something was wrong with the whole formula this time.(Richard Roxburgh) was too hysterical like the movie at times. But who can blame him? Nobody paid heed to performance here, plus he was doing his scenes in a green studio; now how atmospheric!Aside from (Kate Beckinsale) being so silly, or how they forgot that she got the same hair color of her co-star, why she had to die at the end?! That was teary in unnecessary and fabricated way. Most likely (Sommers) was preparing something for the sequel, where (Anna Valerious) comes back as a rescuer ghost or something. But I'm still asking myself: how (Sommers) forgot to make us feel any bound with the characters just to be worry about them through the huge climax which was nearly the last half hour of the movie?! Not to mention, how the main goods, namely the CGI, looked phony and headlong at places; like the jump at the ballroom scene, or Mr. (Hyde)'s fight.You have to sense a pity for all of this money, time, and effort, to be in this disappointing blockbuster. I liked the enjoyable idea to gather all the star monsters of the cinematic horror's history, through clever plot, where the unborn children of (Dracula) will come to life by Dr. (Frankenstein)'s beast, with appearances by (The Wolf Man), and Mr. (Hyde). So the Holy Order organization that's MI6 to (James Bond) old times, or the idea of angry young advanced (Van Helsing). Really what a party, and regrettably what a lousy one in the same time. As (Sommers) got the CGI in his mind more than anything, caring for the way (Dracula) walks on walls more than the way he talks!Despite the record it hit, and points it mastered like the scary sound effects, and the village sets--this movie is average. (Sommers) seemed so joyful about the toys that he was playing with, being the only one who had fun out of them. He wanted to make the biggest eye candy ever, and he delivered it, however semi-pure. He made his own statement in the Horror genre, and left his generation's technique-eats-up-drama kind of stamp too. The only thing to not cry about is that it's not that BAD, UGLY BAD. But it was so close to be a monster itself to tell you the truth!It has the feeling of video game all over it, and no wonder since they launched it indeed as one, in the same year of its release. Hmmm, makes you think; maybe they erred and made the movie as the video game!",Null,1,2,19 October 2008
Monsters vs. Aliens," Being good while needing something to be very good isn't really bad !
","They told me 'Monsters vs. Aliens is bad'. Bad is what that itself turned out to be after viewing this fun movie. How many elements do form its perfect fun? Let's see..The casting. It's quite familiar criticism that what DreamWorks misses (in term of creative story, 3D,.. etc) compensates by assembling at random any stars walk in Hollywood streets. This round, everything clicked rightly with everyone. Reese Witherspoon as Susan - Ginormica - Murphy, Seth Rogen as B.O.B, Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach, Will Arnett as The Missing Link, Kiefer Sutherland as General Monger, and Stephen Colbert as President Hathaway--represent, literally, great casting work. Originally, I'm not, by any chance, a Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, or Will Arnett fan. In fact, you can call me the opposite of a 'fan' as long as it concerns these guys. In any movie they do, whatever its defaults were, I used to see them as the WORST. So, it was such a mind-blowing surprise to find myself falling in love with their voices as those characters. I haven't thought that Witherspoon has that tender voice and wonderful performance, or that Rogen is that funny. Even Sutherland did one of his most memorable character I kid you not. Which leads to the next factor...The writing. While mixing some of the 1950s cheap monsters movies, with the 1960s super spy vs. 'I want to takeover the world' evil man movies, the script, so brilliantly, reproduces a cute, hot, and explosively comic version of (Seven Samurai), with a message too of 'be yourself, no matter what they say' or 'it doesn't matter what you look like, it's all about your heart'. There is even a wicked pun in the title; where the monsters vs. aliens, and vs. being an actual aliens in their society as well. The movie is cracking. The best comedy DreamWorks ever made I presume. From the wacky characters, to the unbroken laughs, I had a mega-enjoyable time. The script has a one of a kind comic talent; just recall character like B.O.B with his involuntary personating; where he gets to be anybody's character passionately, or antics like President Hathaway's, or scenes like showing the way how the lead characters became monsters. It's all a creative entertainment.The lines worked like a snappy punches: 'As you can see, he has no brain. / Turns out, you don't need one. Totally overrated!', 'I think that Jello gave me a fake phone number!', 'I'm not looking to get married just to live in someone else's shadow, and you're casting a pretty big shadow!', 'Once again, a UFO has landed in America, the only country UFOs ever seem to land in!', and 'Dr. Cockroach, I would really appreciate it if you didn't do your mad scientist laugh!'.The direction made a top action sequences, like the fight over the bridge. The designers made dazzling interiors for the aliens' spaceship. The editing has a superb timing which's rarely found in the cartoon or 3D movies of today. And the references to, for instance, the arcade game (Dance Dance Revolution) at the try of shutting down the spaceship's electronic brain, or playing the theme song of (Close Encounters of the Third Kind) which was directed by DreamWork's owner Steven Spielberg, and Harold Faltermeyer's music of (Axel F) at the first encounter with the aliens. All of that worked for the benefit of this movie's clever mildness. I liked in specific the closing credits, which was designed a la Maurice Binder's moving shadows from James Bond movies. This is like a cinema's tribute to itself and us.About the shortcomings, I thought that the evil man Gallaxhar, played by Rainn Wilson, was the least interesting character around, despite his importance to the story. All what he had to be distinguished by was 4 eyes in the face! Another flaw came from the idea of unleashing an army of Gallaxhar clones, while having another army of sure bigger and stronger robot probes! Gallaxhar was stupid; he could have owned the world with these giant probes. Even an idea like 'He did that because he was stupid' wasn't used. And a correction: We don't wear turbans on our heads in Egypt as it was shown at the sequence of Gallaxhar's speech to the Earth's nations!Now, the movie's major flaw, rather major letdown for many: the second act. It's short, laconic and disappointing. It has only 3 events: the fight with the probe, the party of Susan's new friends at her folks' home, and Susan's emotional shock due to her fiancé's reaction towards her transformation. On another level, that act didn't go through the lives of the rest of the monsters' team else Susan. Since these characters were lovely and rich, we wanted to have more of them, but it was official: Susan is the lead, and the rest are sidekicks. However, if they were more taken care of, this movie would have been more satisfied and satisfactory. Because these characters' storylines, even if made as short, could have diffused more affection and - why not - comedy to the final product.Earlier I read about (Monsters vs. Aliens) something that went like this: 'It's another DreamWorks big-budget CG feast of flash-in-the-pan celebrities and trite pop culture references'. Though after watching it, I said: 'Here's a triumph for DreamWorks, and a complete joy to us'. Despite nearly missing an act in my viewpoint, DreamWorks DID IT this time. Frankly, where there're 'creative' and 'enjoyable' with 'a message', it's hard to ask for more. Because when a good movie needs something to be very good; it doesn't mean that it is bad. On the contrary, it is a good movie already.",Null,0,1,8 June 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," I'm Not a Parrot !
","Everybody says that this is a great movie; the box office, the Oscars, the bigwig critics, even the viewers' reviews all over the internet. But you know what? I have a mind of my own. And this is not a great movie by any mean. It is a bad movie, if not very bad as well!The story looks like the worst Agatha Christie imitation. It sets up a mystery, in one place, and crowds a dozen of suspects, with no clues for you. That's the perfect way for the viewer to lose their interest, since nobody relayed on their inelegance, or admitted it in the first place. It's where they tell you 'Be just a viewer. Not try to think. There are more smart people in the movie to do that for you!' So, I couldn't care less about a mystery that couldn't care less about me!The pace is stupidly condensed. It's like a TV series that has been compressed, not even abbreviated. There are almost 3 hours that feel like 5 hours long. And to add more fuel, the editing intended butchering every single moment, with exhaustingly snap cutting that made the shot length range between one second and less than a second, to the extent of not figuring out many points, or listing appropriately to many lines. It's like being in a restaurant which puts the food in front of you for only an instant. Hence I was 'smelling' subjects, for 3 consecutive hours, and it's no way for anyone to be satisfied!!..And this won the Academy Award for the best editing?? There is something deeply wrong, not in me, but in the movie, and - accordingly - in the Oscars!So the lead character Mikael Blomkvist had a fling with the title character for what reason?! Because she let him smoke unlike his boss / mistress?!! Basically, why in god's name that girl had sex with him, or rather fell in love with him?? That I didn't even have a possible answer to!Every review refers to the genius way how the Swedish landscape was filmed. I didn't see anything genius, nor distinct, about it at all though!45 years, and nearly all the crime's witnesses and investigators are alive, with sharp memory?!!All the TV sets, in every part of the world, is on, and showing NOTHING but the news of businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström. So, whether there is no other channels or news on the planet, or there is no other way to give info in the scriptwriter's mind!The serial killer has a room in his mansion, where he tortures, murder, and tears up women, for 5 decades, and his dear beloved wife, who lives with him in the same mansion, doesn't know a thing about it. Hmmm, far-fetched? No, it's TOTAL NONSENSE!..And he films his crimes? Why?? To provide a full evidence against himself later?!! And what about the paintings that the grandfather receives? Why not to trace their sender back?? And if Anita gave her identity to Harriet, where did Anita go?? Ahh, maybe they said it somewhere but the editing slaughtered it. But if the movie's makers think that I may watch their work again to search for that; then they can't be more mistaken, because they didn't seduce me to do so by any way, not dramatically or cinematically!The title character is shown as invincible ALL LONG. She's super smart like a walking Google, can't be beaten by anybody, and achieves victory every time so easily. This is boring. Moreover, if James Bond is described as unbelievable, then it's at least an admitted fantasy, but when The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo insists on realistic tone, then she's yet more unbelievable!There is a mandatory lesbian sex scene in every Hollywood movie during the last 15 years. Honestly, I'm deadly sick of the obvious compulsion, the endless repetition, and the cheap commercial supplication of that. In this manner, I bet you, the children cartoons will include it too, very soon!Then look at the movie's universe. It is rotten to the bone. Yes, I know that it's familiar in noir to present rotten places, characters, deeds. However, this time the relationships were deformed to inhuman degree, and the events contained many horrible and emetic images. Not only this, the movie made that always drugged and killer-wannabe title character as the most brilliant and pure character around. If that was the movie's substance and goal; then I hated it, before I couldn't buy it!David Fincher. What are you doing man?! Once, you've done Se7en and Fight Club. And then, you're doing Zodiac and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Do you have a schizophrenia in terms of quality? Well, following your movies assures that clearly!I liked the creative opening titles, the moment when Daniel Craig improvised catching the water bottle. NOTHING MORE!All in all, let anybody love that movie, let the Oscar give it 1000 awards, and let the studies delude the people by buying reviewers, or even writing praising reviews under false names on the internet. Let them do whatever they want to do. The most important thing is: I'm not a parrot. Or in other words: THIS IS UNBEARABLE TO WATCH!",1,1,4,22 December 2015
Rocky IV," Useless !
","It's not one of the worst movies ever made.. only. It's one of the movies that watching it equals not watching it!This is, to its date, the most un-needed, pointless and silly Rocky movie. I can tell the story of it in maybe 5 seconds, and it won't amuse you either. Simply what makes the movie, any movie, is its conflict. This one got none. There is no character development, astonishing moment or even a good dialogue. It adds nothing to the character but a brain tumor. It adds nothing to the Russians but the same old stereotyping. And it adds nothing to us but a stupid waste of time!So smart to make your opponent that inhuman. I was laughing, originally knowing that it's impossible to watch Rocky, as Mr. America, getting beaten by that Russian robot, and in the highest of the cold war's days. Hence it's dumbly predictable as well!The performance hit a new degree of goofiness. For little instance, (Dolph Lundgren), who would be a master of uncountable V movies later, didn't do anything that bad in his entire life.Specking about goofiness; look at (Stallone)'s little speech to the Russians at the end. And if you didn't like it, watch him wiping them off the face of the earth, 3 years later, in Rambo III. Now I know why (Ronald Reagan) loved being called Rambo, not Rocky!But even if, (Stallone), as a writer / director / star of the show, wanted Rocky to go east, to do what he had to do, teaching these communists a lesson, yet with class, assuring his message of peace (and I mean the sport's one, Not America's!). However, just the characterization of the Russians assures how *objective* and *peace loving* (Stallone) was from the start!The movie's elements got nothing remarkable. I didn't find something to enjoy, rather to watch. It's pretty average, and with the mentality of it, as a commercial movie or a message one, it's weak and useless. By the way, it's my first time ever to call a movie useless. But this one earns it!",5,2,6,6 February 2010
Dreamgirls," Not a Good Musical. Average Movie. And Yes, Highly Overrated Too !
","And when I say average, it's a way to talk sweet about what I don't want to call bad!The journey of (The Supremes), a trio of female singers from the 1960s to the 1970s, has turned into a Broadway musical, then that musical itself has turned into a Hollywood movie. So, I went to watch the movie to see the drama of that musical, the background of these ages, and how all of that was cinematically portrayed. But the outcome made me shut it off after its middle, and while being a very devoted and patient viewer myself, I didn't have any interest to complete it. After months, I ran into it again, to force myself to complete it; whether to prove my initial viewpoint wrong, or assure that I was right. And boy, I was so right!Let us see the story. With attractive time periods, and singing dialogues, the script didn't manage to be any close to attractive. It deals with everything in great tepidity. The scenes are perfunctory and cold. The moving of the songs in on the flat, so laconic, lines seemed pure annoying and loud. Let alone that these songs weren't excellent in the first place.True the performances seemed good, yet in the very tight limits of that script. The thing is the writing did a weak job to explore its material, or reach any credibility or intimacy. What kind of movie that gives no details to its characters, or no characters?! To instance; why Eddie Murphy went to drugs, or cheated on his wife for years? So, after his death, while hearing a full song to elegize someone that we didn't know, you have to feel tedium! You can say that again about Lorrell; the band's third party. Beyoncé as Deena becomes so rich and famous, not knowing how awful the life of her previous co-singer Effie turned into, however she suddenly concerns, when she suddenly discovers that she sang Effie's song unaware it was hers! So was she opportunist from the start, or just extremely blind? All of these questions and more were caused by what seemed as opportunist blind script!As for the directing, noting was magnificent. Handling the matters was so usual to a degree which made it poor to watch. It got no style to it, or personal touch. Even the dexterity of factors like the customs, the make-up, etc, which's natural in A-level Hollywood movie, deepened the fact about how the direction added zero. I don't recall one super sequence. The musical parts are anything but distinct; they felt like old TV variety show with just good cameras this time. As you see, that cinematic interpretation lacked being real cinematic. Sure with names like (Oliver Stone) or (Tim Burton) that should have been more interesting and artistic.Hence I was watching a frigid docu-drama with bright image and Hollywood stars. Or, at best, a hasty operetta with high budget and shadows of leads and drama. Both ways, I discovered in the end that I wasn't given much time to feel the characters, or the subject, fine. In fact, the movie ends naively, but I was glad though, since that uninteresting movie which I was watching came to an end anyway. So in general, some colors dazzled me, but nothing else did.Still what got on my nerves badly was the way this movie was praised and Oscared. I adore the musicals. Therefore imagine my tragedy with the last 40 years' movies. Then imagine my joy lately with big musical movies from Hollywood again, and my multiple concern considering their fewness too; (Moulin Rouge), (Chicago), and (Sweeney Todd). Therefore, I went to watch (Dreamgirls) to be highly disappointed. Save couple of songs, (Jennifer Hudson)'s only vocal performance, and seeing (Eddie Murphy) doing well in non-comedic role, this movie is in the bottom of the list; whether as entertaining or effective.P.S: I hated the movie's internal claim that the disco music was a refused degeneration for the real black music, as if it was a cheap exploitation of it, that obliterated its personality (??!!). If that was the opinion, then I have to refuse it itself. Art is freedom, renovation and discovery. Nothing can obliterate anything. And, simply, I love the disco music.",Null,1,3,22 March 2010
Spider-Man," So Why This Could Be The Silliest Movie Ever Made ?!
","There is something genuinely SILLY about this movie. So let's review it to discover how it's not 'something' inasmuch as 'some things':_(Tobey Maguire) is not Spiderman, Superhero, or good actor, or charismatic star!_How he became Mr. web in my hand? OHH.. He had been bitten by a super spider. So let's have that naughty advanced spider to bite a lot of young boys and girls to have lots of Spidermen, Spidergirls, Spiderdogs. Surely one of them could be less provocative then you know who!_(Willem Dafoe) is kidding with us? Right? Because he is a fine actor, not just a bad joke wearing some kid's stupid green toy. He was having a rare schizophrenia to be a businessman at day, then some MacDonald's plastic doll at night!_Spiderman looks cool and athletic when he is in the suit, but (Tobey) looks just boyish. Another reason to believe that HE'S NOT THE MAN IN THE SUIT!_That script can be the cheesiest script ever. Actually, making a comic book movie does not mean writing it dully. It could've been more suitable to make it like it takes place in the 1940s. To tell you the bitter truth, it looked more like it had been produced in the 1940s!_The CGI was obvious, adolescent, and guess what? Silly._At the scene of (Spiderman) and (Green Hornet), in which they were talking over some building, why I felt like I'm watching a lousy puppet show? Even the kid in me vetoed: 'What kind of nonsense you're watching pal, get a life!'._Why all the characters, the situations, the events, the dialogues, the actors, even the action looked like old bad TV episode with primitive performance from everybody, and campy sense all over everything? A mystery indeed._Spiderman has an idiot alter ego, works at a newspaper, with nervous yet nice editor-in-chief who wants to know everything about the hero from that young journalist! Hallooo!! I hear echoes from Superman here, so why to make it again? As the old comics or not, they didn't find other solutions. Therefore, I got the deja-vu syndromes._ I didn't like (Kirsten Dunst) acting here; it was overdone._(Kirsten Dunst) and her last scene. I can't hold my laughs. At the first time I watched it, I laughed like a drain. Her performance was so awful, and (Tobey) was like a child at a school's play who forgot his lines to gaze smiling with idiot look on his face (I think it's natural), then he refused simply the 'sudden weepy' love of her and left. I thought: 'You're such a fool! How dare you refuse her love?!, it was a miracle to find someone to love you in the first place!!'. That was illogical, and was acted badly, to a real funny degree!_The last shot, when Spidey is jumping all over the fake skyscrapers, and making a lot of fatuous CGI around, he is just unexpectedly jumping at us??!! Aside from being scary for some, I felt it was extremely funny and so impressive as a good example for this movie's unique silliness._2 sequels?? That's unbearable. Tells you a lot about a generation who wants more psychedelic SuperAnything even it was SuperMaguire!The year of 2008 witnessed the release of part 3, and after a while, there was the release of the parody (Superhero Movie). Although I didn't watch the spoof yet, but nothing could be sillier than the original itself!",5,1,2,28 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Mercy is Sweet !
","I loved the first 2 Harry Potter movies. Then forgot all about them after watching. Now, everybody told me that the third is the best of the best. After watching it, it's official: they're all wrong!I can assure you; the 3 leads were so fine (Yes, Daniel Radcliffe wasn't silly yet!). The directing was solid and beautiful. The music was hearty. And the imagination was the highest point at all; I adore the eater book.. priceless! But save that, I didn't find anything more to be loved!It's this script. I hated it so much. After the intro sequence of the flying relative, I didn't run into something as complete. The facts were being discovered in non-exciting way. Even the time travel matter near the end wasn't a satisfying climax. I think, as a whole, the fantastic images kept the screenwriter away from the main conflict which transformed eventually into something latent, thin and uninteresting.I felt no comic moments. The actors themselves were out of being funny, with so dry lines and situations. (Emma Watson) was creepy more than droll. I pitied great talent like (Maggie Smith) for playing an extra. And needeless to prove that (Michael Gambon) is the worst Dumbledore at all! The poor man isn't a peer to the late (Richard Harris), else being so pale and weak Dumbledore apart. This casting turned the character from 150-year-old wise mentor into uncharismatic and tasteless teacher.Despite the magical frame, this was humdrum. I was screaming at places: 'Mercy.. have mercy on me people!'. Maybe it's for the die-hard fans. But surely not for me.By the way, after days of watching it, I forgot it as well, however with irritation this time!",Null,1,4,25 October 2009
54," Anti and Pro ??!!
","It is not a confusing movie. It's just confused. And with other defects too.Most of this cast are so pale. (Ryan Phillippe) and (Breckin Meyer) both look like children, or idiots. But while this partly could mean good casting for their simpleton characters, the real problem was that they didn't add anything to their roles; being uncharismatic, and without any depth at all. So how about being in the hands of a clueless script that has no depth or whatsoever?!The movie shows the atmosphere of New York in the late 1970s, and how some of the cream de la cream were living, or rather being doped. The sinking into this freedom of nightclub 54, so the developments of what it leads to moral collapses, are all clear. But suddenly, at the end, all of that turned into a mixed up stuff; the guys who were taking tons of drugs became suddenly clean?, the couple who was about to break became suddenly so in love??, and the movie which was a satire all along became suddenly an elegy???It came to a point where it cries over the days of 54 where the freedom was so unlimited; (Steve Rubell) says a real goodbye to his staff, while the movie says the same to these days, in unhappy farewell, saluting (Rubell), and his original dream of a club, with the hat off. So, as a whole, was it a movie about how filthy 54 was? Or was it a movie about how great it was? Was this movie's (Steve Rubell) a ground-breaker creator, a wise mentor, a symbol of sensual liberty that deserved to be missed in the modern BAD America? Or was he a repulsive degenerate, who loved only money, cocaine, and being in control, and built a destructive hellhole? It shows that Mr. (Mark Christopher), the movie's director who wrote it also, didn't ask these questions to himself in the first place!I didn't understand the problem of the 3 young leads while the movie was busy making a very shoddy love triangle between them. I didn't understand what's this movie's character mainly; anti 54 and the days of disco?, pro?, neutral historian?, anti and pro in the same time?! And I didn't feel joy out of the movie itself, since none of it was great or remarkable.I can't say that (Mike Myers) did it fine, since this script didn't make his character finely at all. He just stole the show being solidly serious, considering originally his reputation as a comic star, plus being - surely - the best actor in this bunch!I hate, truly hate, when I said about a movie: 'What did this one want?'. Simply because this can mean that this movie lost its meaning someway. And with this acting, directing, I hated the movie itself. It just looks like its leads.. confused; a fan of the illusionary colorful lights and a discloser for their illusion in the same time.P.S: Now, there is a talk about a longer version, a director's cut, blah blah blah. Grrrrr! It didn't amuse me to the extent of seeking its right, un-shown, original. With many 'director's cut' versions nowadays, I feel that this is exactly how to sell the expired goods twice!",Null,1,2,7 December 2009
Aliens," Aliens Simply = The First Alien × James Cameron !
","The title said it all. It's not one Alien this round. It's many of them. And the reason is clear; a 32-year-old man at the moment by the name of James Cameron.I must admit that I respect the guy. Since his start, he added his fingerprint so visibly on the action movie-making in Hollywood. Cameron loves, just loves, the titanic look for the action. And he's so smart at making that as well. His first movies as a writer are the best when it comes to define that historically. (The Terminator - 1984) was a mix between sci-fi and straight big and loud action (Apparently after Star Wars, sci-fi became not that artistic anymore and transformed into popular mainstream hits). Then (Rambo: First Blood Part II - 1985) was the right way for how to explode a B-movie to the max, but in a good way. So they brought him to do what he already did with (First Blood), by doubling it into 10 times its action, however with a classic hit named (Alien). And he simply did it.Despite the smart elements that (Cameron) put, it's the first movie's formula anew. He came just to add: Some marines; so crazy and violent; unlike the rational and scientific team of the first which externally looks boring in comparison, and so many; to be killed one by one later. A kid into the action. A daughter-mother relationship. Surprisingly a good robot this time, while keeping the conspirator member also, but after turning him into human. And, of course, dear aliens, with more scenes to see their ugliness appropriately.I can't say that the Slasher movie was working finely under the surface, because to tell you the truth, there was no substance in the first place, so the slasher thing was all over it with nothing more! However, the non-stop action, the hot thrill and the solid horror, with - not to forget - the many dazzling explosions--it managed to keep things going on interestingly enough on the screen as a perfect Hollywood fare. Or the Hollywood fare thereafter. Because (Aliens) sat a new redefinition for the sci-fi action that countless next movies would follow.The outrageous financial success consolidated that, since it grossed nearly quintuple its original budget: the $18,500,000. I read that just grossing double the budget is considered a lovely thing for the producers, so how about 5 times more (and that's just domestically speaking too!). Let alone the appreciation of the Academy that honored it with an Oscar for the best sound effects editing, and another for the best visual effects, with being nominated for 5 more Oscars; best original score, sound, editing, set decoration, and actress. However, despite all of that, the first is still better on all the levels.The intellectual substance is so out this round. It's the exploitive sequel after all. The swearing, the violence, and the nudity (even if slightly shown) are disturbing factors for me. Plus there are holes that kill me; for instance, if the lead stayed for 57 years out of earth, then why she wasn't worried about any relative that she got or whatsoever?! It came to my knowledge lately that there was a scene about her daughter, then it got deleted. I believe for things like these, Sigourney Weaver threatened to not do any more 'Alien' movies after seeing the movie's final cut; so as a compromise, the 1987 Special Edition was released on Laser-Disc. Over and above, the scene of forgiving (Ripley) for destroying a millions dollars facility was utterly laughable. So how about destroying new, huger, ones this time too?! But hey, that's for the fun of it anyway!For me, it doesn't hit the degree of the first's top amusement. Hence, I just get sick when I read that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. It maybe contributed to define how the greatest pure action would be made. It was voted the 42nd greatest film of all time by Entertainment Weekly. Fairly they describe it as the 'greatest pure action movie ever.' It's pure indeed. After more than a decade, (Titanic) would be chosen as the 6th best big blockbuster of all time by Total Film magazine. Well, neither is sci-fi's evolution, or romantic epic. But surely they're fine action ones. And there where their noble metal exists.In brief, the first had the surface and the depths. This one has a surface only; the same one of the first too. But apparently it was more refulgent. Or should I say more explosive!",Null,1,4,17 December 2009
Ocean's Eleven," Ocean's Eleven Robots !
","It's the score this time. Not the scorers.(Soderbergh) wanted the trust of the studio?, wanted to be a big player?, wanted to fulfill his own dreams by directing Hollywood dreams first? Whatever the reason was, the man delivered. But despite being loved or successful, the popcorn movie which he made was so unfunny and spiritless. Maybe it's (Soderbergh)'s real unconcern of the project's nature coming unconsciously on the surface. Maybe that's his very sense of humor. Or maybe he got a desire to insert something extra in a genre movie?!With unceasing warm colors, so smooth editing and soothing, low tone, soundtracks, the movie's time managed to be anesthetic; like seeing everything through hued glass of many bottles of wines while being a bit drunk; which took a lot from the movie's supposed suspense.Despite the considerable halo of coolness around the actors, I knew pretty little data about all of their characters, with no moving matters. So I couldn't care less. You must notice that they don't make mistakes either; the problems are always around them, not inside of them, which's surely inhuman, read: boring thing to attract any attention. Plus there was no interplay between them, or anything like it. To tell you the truth, it pushed me at times to think that (Soderbergh) was intending to show us the bad affect of the contemporary modernism on the human's relationships. Sometimes they're like actors with so insignificant material to do while the stars' charm does the rest. And sometime I believed that the insignificant material was silly, and the stars' charm was lost, rather speechless, amongst it.It looks nice, but it doesn't feel the same, since there aren't that nice characters in the first place. I watched bunch of outwardly different replicants who work together for money. Well, at least the original movie, which many consider goofy in comparison, made them one band of friends who work for money, having some motives as well. Showing the whole gang scrutinizing their unspoken dreams while watching a dazzling fountain, celebrating silently their must-be-in-the-dark glory with Debussy's Clair de Lune playing in the background was well expressive moment, but nothing in the world can prevent me of convincing that it would've been more deep, emotional, and long-lived with an early glance over their actual dreams.Save the idea of the lover thief who wants to get his love back and 'hit' his rich opponent, nothing was human. I sensed a human breath in only 2 scenes (Clooney reunites with Roberts for the first time after going out of jail, and the one where Damon and Mac were bluffing Garcia). In fact, the cuteness and cleverness in them looked not present in all the rest. There were places that beg a witty line or gag, but nothing was done. And even the real *funny* gags were whether too cold, or too American to be followed.For instance, in a second viewing, I discovered that every time we get to see (Pitt), he's having a snack. Is that funny? Maybe with other, real funny, situations it could've been smart touch. Because being as it is alone was poor, giving a feel that this cast was just enjoying a vacation in Vegas where they eat and hang out together while doing, and saying, nothing funny!With another cast that would've been way less interesting. However, while the stiff personality suits the character played by (Andy Garcia) to be that scary, it was unfortunate that most of the rest looked the same under the name of coolness!The absence of the A-list, star-studded, heist movie since the 60s's end and the 70s's start was part of the reason why this was a hit. Simply this kind was long-time missed. Plus I believe that its success opened the way during the whole 2000s for similar projects like The Italian Job (2003), Inside Man (2006), The Brothers Bloom (2008), let alone 2 (Ocean) sequels, to be made, returning the 'Hollywood' heist to 'Hollywood'.For me, I enjoyed part of the scheme, the good image, and the nostalgic, high class, soundtrack, but none of the characters. And with this outcome, it isn't a very good or finely memorable movie. It's only a good one to pass the time with.Losing the interplay between the characters and their viewers is a calamity. So again, is it (Soderbergh)'s indifference? Is it just his dry fun? Or is it his own satire; where it becomes all about the score, taking the humanity out of its scorers as long as they do it right anyway? But even if that was the point; then this is the movie to display that, and to be an example for it in the same time too!P.S: (Brad Pitt)'s voice and persona were so recognizable as the SWAT team's leader in the walkie-talkie. I have no idea why to blow up the movie's biggest twist prematurely as easy as this?!",6,1,5,2 January 2010
The Butterfly Effect," The Butterfly Effect Didn't Effect !
","This script had a lot of ambition to make something different: a sci-fi thriller with a new idea, dark atmosphere, AND something to say. However, that same script nearly killed itself by its own hands!Firstly, that 'something' that it wanted to say. Is it about how we mustn't fall in love, so our life will be so happy? Or we must travel through time to change it till we actually make it as good as possible?! The main disaster here is that the movie, till its last minutes, was assuring that every try to modify the fate was a contribution to realize fate's high will. But, at the end, they put ridiculously such a fabricated finale to confirm concepts which were utterly contradictory compared to all what was said from the very start. Hence, the message of the whole thing became something like 'If you cancel love from your life, it'll be fine'!Maybe the best thing that this end told us was that any try to repeat the past would never be in the interest of its doer, as your objection to your own fate would make you lose. Though, originally, the movie's premise was based on how God has complicated plans, therefore when (Kutcher) was traveling in time, he was just achieving that mysterious omnipotent plan. So why did that script continue the playing, to end up with stopping the drama at another failure round, in despite of (Kutcher)'s discovering for the truth about the upper hand of fate all along?!I think the lost storyline here, from the beginning, is about how this lead will never bear his life as it is. Because he, like us, can't play God. He only can be a human; himself. But when he settled down peacefully in another time, yet lost his only love, the movie didn't say 'make peace with your life, to live it as better as you can', No, it said: 'Don't try to mess with fate', otherwise you may lose, as we already knew by watching the whole thing, as if this is a loop of a movie, with nothing but empty circles that say the same thing, many times, boringly!Maybe they wanted to make a compromise of an end; not to end it tragically for the fear of low profits, or to end it happily with the lead finally living in harmony with his life. Or maybe they suspended it in a way, to have the opportunity of making a sequel; as they already did 2 years later! But whatever, THIS ENDING made the effect of (Butterfly Effect) weaker, or out of focus. And compared to all what was before it, it's irrelevant and dumb!Aside from that annoying ending, and unquiet meaning, things weren't much better. The script manipulated its characters unwisely. For instance, when the lead finds himself in a collage with his girlfriend, he suddenly finds out that he has a spoiled attitude! Well, how can his personality change to treat his friends badly, then wonder about it?! Plus, the tragedy of (Ashton Kutcher) pale face and performance. It's so hard on him to handle such a role. To tell you the truth, (John Patrick Amedori), the child who played his character in some scenes, was more powerful than him. And, forever and ever, the nudity was unnecessary, degraded, and disgusting way to sell the movie, any movie for that matter!To be fair, I liked the main idea, some efforts done by the 2 directors, (Eric Bress) and (J. Mackye Gruber), while dealing with the thrilling moments, (Amedori) acting, and that's it!All in all, it was creative idea for a movie which turned out to be not that creative itself, and ended up as one of the dullest, and muddiest, movies ever dealt with time travel.",2,0,3,1 December 2007
Batman Begins," OK Nolan !
","So they wanted to reinvent Batman. And they did it with a mentoring sequence, an evil mentor, a psychological problem, a Q from James Bond movies, a sweetheart from the childhood, good cop, bad cop, a scarecrow as an enemy, a drug to make the city in fear. OK. Good work.(Christian Bale) isn't fit for Batman. I believe that he's a very good actor who got lost into Hollywood. The blockbusters aren't for him, and he's not for them. He's bigger, too serious, and lacking the glamour and the charisma of the action heroes; I didn't buy him in his fight scenes.(Christopher Nolan) tries to pass in Hollywood. So he does a superhero big budget summer flick. Yes, there is a portion of seriousness, with a speech about beating the fear before it beats us, a decayed society, steps the rich people (namely Batman, or his parents) must take to rescue the city. But he didn't give me anything more, anything that belongs to him more than any other directors!Look at the editing, OH MY GOD. It reminded me with an old movie from Honk Kong named (36th Chamber of Shaolin - 1978), one of The Shaw Brothers martial arts movies, where every shot nearly equals the other in time. You read that in (Batman Begins): the average length of a shot was 1.9 seconds. Aside from being too fast, as if the producers did it to squeeze too many events in not too long time, that style tinctured the whole movie with the same color, making the emotional, action, and dialogue scenes have the exact pace and taste. So nothing was special, and eventually I felt that I was watching an exhausting 2 hours trailer!The phase of the lead living in the street wasn't utilized well. The mentoring didn't convince me that he became that able to overcome the entire League of Shadows, and destroy their domicile in no time. Some conversations between the characters were exaggerated and suddenly sophisticated, such as the ones between the lead and his butler, especially the one over having a 'name and reputation'. And (Rutger Hauer)'s character was useless, he was there just to suspect him as the hidden evil boss. So, overall, what I did love wasn't more than some work done in re-writing the world of Batman, and couple of hot action scenes.It's an entertaining fluff, full of stars and explosions, but too hasty and a bit uneven. It feels that (Nolan) was working without much love for what he was doing, or maybe he was new in the industry of Hollywood entertaining fluff. Whatever the case may be, he wanted desperately to have the 'ok' which, with the money this movie won, already happened. However, frankly, and compared to his work up to 2005, (Batman Begins) was the biggest and the worst movie he ever did.",6,2,3,18 June 2011
Meet the Fockers," Meet The Failures !
","The same free excessive bad tasting of the first movie is here and more! And that's quite normal through the golden age of bad tasting which we live since the last 20 years, however this movie had a world record at it; as you would have at least one dirty joke per minute!!(Robert De Niro) felt good with all the extravaganza of the first one (Meet the Parents), when he turned into a comedy star who is now competing with names like (Jim Carrey) or (Mike Myers) along with the success of (Analyze This) at the same time. So he got into the business of Hollywood, and made immediately another sequel for (Meet..) AND (Analyze..)!You nearly can say that again anout (Dustin Hoffman) who needed a role like this for a very long time, a role which is nothing like anything he had ever done in his career. But for me, I didn't enjoy much, or at all, and I longed to see him with (De Niro) in something good, that has an exigency instead of THIS!Well, I liked the idea of the movie itself as a sequel. Because after the torture of the bridegroom in part one, by the hands of that serious rigorous intelligence man, now we have the opportunity to witness the opposite when we see the torture of that old officer by the hands of that bridegroom's family. That was nice, but like I've said AS AN IDEA, or as some brief scenes of which you can be hooked by in some trailer!Although I deemed the sequence of (Ben Stiller) when he was looking after the baby, or the confusion about him having a son, as cute ones, but I didn't like a long list of other things from these disgusting jokes, which this movie is immersed in, to the sudden changing of (De Niro)'s character at the end!This is not the average comedy or even the weak comedy; this is the most silly nauseating comedy which I hoped for 'The End' to be on screen during all of it, especially while it gave me no smile, rather effective pain.All in all, bad tasting, bad comedy, bad movie, bad memory.",1,0,0,27 October 2007
Man on the Moon," It's (Lawrence Of Arabia) Meets (Ed Wood) !!
","It's a story about a man working in an art watched by millions, not for the art, and not for the millions, but simply.. for himself. It's totally different situation, and it's a rare case for an exceptional hero. So the movie tried to be as unusual as its lead character. Nevertheless, remember that I said 'tried'!It's not that kind of biography movie at all. It's a film about the success of a man, a comedian, who had all of these silly jokes, mysterious intentions, and odd style, though he made it to be a star, some kind of star anyway!It's all in the last scene, where we have that unforgettable bored to death look from his wife and his producer, while all the acclamation of his fans for their star's biggest practical joke ever. Watch carefully the very last shot, with that wonder smile of his writer / friend (Bob Zmuda), which recognizes strongly that strange but great admiration from all of (Kaufman)'s audience. It's maybe the most powerful feeling created by that film, or THE certain meaning which created such a film originally, especially when you know that there is no accident like that in the actual life of (Andy Kaufman). It says: 'Even the silly ones have their own die hard fans', and it's true. Otherwise, it's just a story about a man who believes in himself, being confident in his talent to the furthest limit, despite anyone or anything.The problem of this film was its semi mute script. You think that the uniqueness of this man required much effort to scrutinize his character, and examine his history. Instead, it gave us results not reasons. No convincing, or even understandable, excuses for his behavior. And just too brief scene from his childhood - as his so-called 'history' - which told eventually nothing. That's why the script ended up as endless practical jokes, silly one after another!So, as a comedy, it's not one in the first place. As a bio-pic, I knew from it that its lead character was nearly untalented comedian, with twisted sense of humor that didn't make me laugh, rather made me disgusted. And as a character-study film, it didn't care to study anything, and its message about 'believing in yourself' was represented through a story of a ridiculous loser, namely the worst representative for such a message!(Man on the Moon) tried to be as different as its character, but didn't explore that character; thus lost it, the difference, and us. Its lead character reminded me with real characters through cinematic bio-pics; to be as self-centered and determined on assuring his greatness as (Lawrence of Arabia - 1962), and as art-loving and feeble-minded as (Ed Wood - 1994). This film's (Kaufman) was a cross between both, however without any glance of their luster. So - sorrowfully - the film was muddled. And while none of its factors deserved to be watched again, then it was not only muddled film, it was dry too!As for the film's funny title, I read that it was the title of a song that has been written after (Kaufman)'s death for the memory of him. But when you have it as a title for that film in specific, then you must ask yourself: (Man on the moon)?! Is he above all?, or is he so alone in such a dark desolate place which had spots of light sometimes? I'm just wondering!",3,1,2,23 July 2007
The Princess Bride," Magical Story, But Not Magical Movie !
","The best thing (William Goldman), the respectable screenwriter, ever did in this fairytale which he created, was the way he told it. Look at the boy's room; it has all the details of consumerism around him. So when the grandfather comes with the book, it's one wicked invitation to read again in a cold, sick, and narrow world that has no reading, true knowledge, or moralities of heroism. We all live in this room, waiting for grandpa and his book to get us out. But while being a movie about the magic of the story, it didn't have any magic further than its story!It's a little book of children; with no big stars, or big budget. In terms of the budget in specific, look at the movie's sets. According to some of them, like the Fire Swamp, I thought I was watching a fantasy-spoof! In brief, it has very naive look. Some saw that as a loyalty to the simplicity of being a children book, not a typical Hollywood blockbuster; hence felt rare magic. And some saw that as simply poor; hence felt frustration. I'm with the second team!
Director (Rob Reiner) tried to master grand aesthetic cadres, and tough swords' duels, evoking all the innocent ventures for the kid in us. Though, there was some slackness, as if (Reiner) was making an old swashbuckler movie, and by its technique too. Sometimes I felt the inactivity of the postal cards more than the vitality of the fantasy adventure. It left its powerful marks on the sequence of breaking into the palace near the end.And let's not forget the movie's top problem; (Cary Elwes). His charisma isn't radiant, his performance is so frigid to an extent that makes you fidget, and generally he was something between (Errol Flynn)'s look-alike and (Errol Flynn)'s parody. Actually, considering (Elwes)'s weakness, putting him in the shadow of (Flynn)'s character in (The Adventures of Robin Hood - 1938), was an ugly irony that enfeebled the whole thing. His first 3 scenes were the last good effort he did here!I didn't like the climax. It was so rapid, and the real hero of it was (Mandy Patinkin) as (Inigo Montoya), whereas (Westley) triumphs just by the power of being weasel. Maybe (Goldman) wanted to assure the ability of the word as well as the illusion, just like the ability of the grandfather, as the storyteller, through the story itself. However, wrapping it up like that was betrayal to the entire legacy of tales we heard, and movies we watched; where climax must be hot, thrilling, and satisfying. Otherwise, why they call it 'climactic' for God's sake?!!Although (Mark Knopfler)'s 'Storybook Love' at the closing credits almost defined the finale's romantic dreamy song in the movies from the 1980s till now, but his music score was evident shortcoming. It's a standard soundtrack for a school play or a home-made movie. Well, the insistence of this movie to be poor is just weird. The only logical explanation is that they mistook poorness for innocence!On the bright side, (Reiner) led his cast rightly, achieving tangible wittiness. (Robin Wright Penn) is the princess bride in person; a clever image that jumped from a good old fairytale. She looked, especially when it comes to her voice, like one of Disney's classic cartoon heroines, yet with unique tenderness and vibrant feelings. However, her acting lacked distinct personality. (André the Giant) was perfect as live cartoon character, and did great job as (Fezzik). (Billy Crystal) and (Carol Kane) were so funny, I didn't recognize (Crystal) at first sight, but his signature voice, way of talking, and shortness uncovered him. Clearly he was enjoying himself to the utmost through (Miracle Max). (Peter Falk) is priceless; while doing nearly 40 movies in cinema, I've always felt that he should have made more, to bewitch us with his genius the way he did with (Lt. Columbo) in TV.The 1980s had festive banquet of fantasies such as (Time Bandits - 1981), (The Flight of Dragons - 1982), (Krull - 1983), (Ladyhawke - 1985), or (Willow - 1988). They were innocent dreams, and lacking the 2000s crazy budgets, hyped CGI, and endless sequels--makes them even more innocent for today's viewer. But while (The Princess Bride) is innocent, it is also poor; in many senses of the word. It's a case of a movie where the script is its highest element.So when the kid in the end asks his grandfather to read it all again, and the grandfather replays enchantingly: 'As you wish'; it's the real substance of this movie. It is author (William Goldman)'s homage to the story as the authentic magic. So disappointing that that meaning didn't have some cinematic magic to support it.",Null,2,8,30 September 2008
The Transporter," Despite Many Hindrances.. This Movie Transports !
","How did the girl manage to go into the second car while her hands, so her feet, were being tied up to a chair? Why the gang didn't send a simple guy with one gun to kill the Transporter and the girl at the first's house? (Great waste of ammo if you asked me!). How this Transporter gets illegal jobs to transport bank robbers, while his face is exposed for all??Naaaaa.. Don't bother yourself. It deals with shutting up, and shutting down, the brain. So at one point, when a bunch of bad guys attack the lead frantically, you'll notice how all of them is without guns, and after long-4-parts fight with them you'll see FINALLY the bad guys WITH the guns coming pretty late I suppose, or is it the right time, regarding the nature of it as straightforward pure direct-to-action flick. It's a typical moment to define what really this movie is all about.It looks like some of the action movies that were made in Europe in the 1960s & the movies of Hong Kong in the 1980s, being clever when it comes to deliver popcorn, so it's a good transporter itself. The action is wonderful, the backgrounds are gorgeous, Qi Shu was charismatic and childish, François Berléand was mildly funny, the music score is enjoyable putting a human feel to it, and the rest of the soundtrack drives the movie as a disco night.On the other hand, (Jason Statham) is really silly, looking more like his car. Yes, he did his share of fighting fairly, doing most of his stunts. But away from that he's metallic, and electronic, except for the few moments where he gives us his bad impression of Clint Eastwood!The motive of the lead, about smuggling Chinese people, can be replaced with anything else: money, gold, drugs, expensive art piece, nuclear bomb, kidnapped kid, et cetera. Of course the 'people' will put a sensitive side to the character and make a human out of the (Statham). Though, the movie deals with them as if they're just like any of the previous choices. Anyhow, this is unmixed action time, so don't be BORING!I must say that (Matt Schulze) as the evil EVIL guy (Wall Street) was ugly, particularly with his idiot eyes. He almost said to the lead: 'Hey, there is a bomb in the bag I'm giving you, I'm evil man Ha Ha Haa!'. But, to tell you the truth, I think that (Ric Young)'s hairpiece was uglier!And what about the 2 police patrols that the transporter met while the girl's attempt to escape? He was a reason of their horrible death! Originally, to where he was taking them during their being in the car's trunk? But why the scriptwriters would bother themselves with points like that, you'll forget it anyway during the loud next sequences, and with the lead saving all the souls at the end, he's wholly forgiven!Watch out for the scene where the transporter survives a shower of bullets by hiding behind a door. You'll find that again at the next Transporter movie; I began to believe that doors can be bulletproof indeed!Nevertheless, it's saner than its sequel. For instance, you read that at (Statham)'s request, the producers took out a moment when his character deflecting a missile with a tea tray, at the assault on (Frank)'s house, as 'he didn't think audiences would believe it'. In the next movie, they'll listen to Statham less (it's something related to getting rid of a bomb in a car's bottom!).In this formula, I've been bothered the most by one part; when Jason Statham is forced to take off his shirt, being in one long fight with so many unarmed men, getting into a mud fight-like with dozen of them, then concluding this sequence by kissing another man (Ugh!) just to suck air out of him in the water!! It's not a haphazard; it's the way some movies want to be commercial even if cheaply and disgustingly.Anyway, you can watch it while traveling in a bus, or if you want to beat some people you hate, or at lonely night when you're not able to sleep. In fact, I read that the real money that this movie made was through the DVD sales.And yes, I think that the monkey in the photo with the child was (Statham) as a kid not the other way around.. Just kidding :)",7,0,1,30 January 2009
2012," A doomsday of repetitions, clichés, coincidences, stupidities and provocations !
","Would anybody save (Roland Emmerich) from himself, or from Hollywood? The man has been doing the same subject over and over and over again. Soon he'll make movies about 'The end of the world' as fast as (Leonardo DiCaprio) was repeating words in The Aviator (2004)!The weirdest thing is that he said, once, that he 'completed' the 'trilogy' of the world's end after Independence Day (1996), Godzilla (1998), and The Day After Tomorrow (2004). He did convince me while saying that he dealt with all the reasons: Aliens' invasion, nuclear-hybrid monster, and climatic disasters. Now, with 2012, it's the world's end again, climatic disasters again, so is it a quatrain or bankruptcy?? I would have forgiven him if only he managed to handle a new side that he missed before. But unfortunately, it looked like an album of his last movies, done with many many faults as well!This has writing's disasters in a way that makes the movie a doomsday of a script. Mainly an invasion of the Body Snatchers: Anew there is a world ending (all the last 3 movies), someone is warning and nobody listens (The Day After Tomorrow), a widower American president with one daughter (Independence Day), 2 lovers come back to each other (Godzilla), a father sacrifices for his son (s) (The Day After Tomorrow), stupid bureaucrats run the crises (Godzilla), the scene of Air force one leaving the white house on the nick of time (Independence Day), the white house gets destroyed (Independence Day), and the happy end where the survivors gather to look to the daylight, and look forward building a new world (The Day After Tomorrow). In brief, it's clear that the West Germany-born (Emmerich) didn't hear the American proverb 'Enough is Enough'!Add to that a flood of clichés: the lead is running from many exploding volcanoes, yet nothing touches him in anyway. That shot is repeated throughout the movie whether it's the lead or the plane, all the planes, he rides! The lead, after saving the world by closing the door of the new Noah's ark, is dead, then No, he's alive!Furthermore, an avalanche of coincidences: while going to camping, the lead finds himself accidentally in a governmental special area. The lead finds the radio announcer who he listens to accidentally in the woods. The presidency's bureaucrat read the lead's book, then runs into him, accidentally for sure, 2 times in 2 different continents right in the middle of the world's end. The lead knows the Russian who happens to own the last plane on earth, and he runs into him in Las Vegas. That plane itself crashes in nowhere but the place of transporting the selected people and animals to the ark. The lead, in mountains of snow, meets someone who happens to be working at the ark, imploring him to take his children to it!Let alone many quakes of stupid points: the hippie announcer dies (because he's crazy!). The American president, who orchestrated the whole scheme of stealing the greatest artworks, and saving exclusively the 'richest' humans on earth, chose to die among his people like a captain who doesn't abandon his ship (so noble my foot!). The rich people, who previously paid the very expensive price of their survival, 1 billion euro each, stands begging the rest to enter the ark, and the leaders of the world's superpowers agree in great sympathy (so noble my foot, number 2!). A hose crammed in shields of the ark's door causes the *real* end of the world (Idiocy!). Now, the lead is considered a hero when he fixes what he already caused by being such a clumsy fool (Super Idiocy!!). However, nothing is beyond the moment when the stepfather was killed so randomly just to secure the old husband in his old wife and children's open arms (hysterical melodrama at its Hindiest!).And it's not complete without being offensive: The big nations didn't apply to the compiled contract, of saving the genetically superior humans. Instead, they chose the rich ones. OK, how that is known? It's easy. Put an Arab with a headband to tell the genetically superior from the rich, where the Arab - naturally - isn't the genetically superior. OH MY GOD, this is a different level of indignity that Hollywood reaches with the Arabs!(John Cusack) couldn't persuade me as a lead of anything to date. He has no charisma, no wit, he's a perfect bore. I won't go through the rest of the cast. If anyone of them had an atom of self-respect, or right artistic sense, he / she wouldn't be in this in the first place. But they always think that being in flashy CGI celebration dominates success, fame, coolness.. whatever. Only (Oliver Platt) was lucky enough to handle a good written character, and the smart that he is made it believable. He was the sole person here who was disaster-proof I suppose!I liked the third act, with that idea of new advanced Noah's ark, without it the movie immerses directly in a black hole of unoriginality. The CGI was decent, but I have seen all of that, and all what happens in it, before and in better shape too.This is euphoric nonsense. It works with children, neophyte viewers, or someone with a desperate need to discharge some negative feelings. What I can't understand though is that how in God's name Godzilla (1998) was nominated for 5 Razzies, and this didn't get any nomination at all??!!",2,1,2,23 November 2011
Ghost Rider," A movie that couldn't defeat its devil !
","Let's do justice to this movie.Good things:1) The story is kind of interesting, not so conventional for a superhero movie; being like creative mix of Faust, Jekyll and Hyde, with elements of the comics' superheroes, and the western's bounty hunters.2) Some aesthetic shots that try to affect emotionally, and pay a good homage to the classic scope cinema of the 1950s, being - as well - a rare victory for the crazily hyped up CGI in the American movies lately.3) The jump over the helicopters; greatly wild.4) The song of The Carpenters; why these old sob songs in specific are so despised in the mainstream soundtracks, and overall considered bad news as if no one likes them?!5) The scene of the lead explaining, honestly and simply, for his girl why he didn't come to their date; highly comic.6) Peter Fonda as The Devil, despite how low the material that was given to him.7) Eva Mendes cute moments.8) Sam Elliot as Caretaker; OH MY GOD, he's the best of this movie; his deep voice, sane performance, and wily humor are what will live long from it.Now, to the bad things:I was about to say everything else the above, but.. I promised of Justice. So count with me:1) Cage's supposedly funny performance is mostly pathetic. His antics, like making faces to a mirror, oozed silliness. And the rest is sinfully predictable.2) His hairpiece; like the ones he wears in 90 % of his last movies, did turn me off. I began to believe it's intentional choice from his side to assure that he hates what he's doing! This time, it aspired after decreasing his age, but ended up deforming him utterly.3) Cage was 43, and it's intelligible that the role was 20 years younger than that! So I loved when he sneered at the difference between his actor, as 17 year old, and his sudden 43 year old appearance by telling Mendes: 'It has been 56,000 year since the last time we've met!'. He actually was sneering at himself! He didn't have the ghost of a chance to look THAT young, I don't know why they didn't modify the script?!4) Mendes can't act. Sorry dear Eva, it's the truth!5) Mendes, as the superhero's girlfriend, is a reporter; well, HOW SHODDY! So was Superman's girl, Batman's girl (in the first movie), even the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' girl!!6) Wes Bentley can't be Satan junior; whoever selected him was so wrong, I hated the guy not because he was evil, but because he failed as one!7) Bentley's weird custom seemed like Neo's custom from The Matrix!8) The confusing matter of; did the lead, as a teen, sign the devilish contract willingly?, or he was just injured in the honed top of it?9) I couldn't understand if the devil wants the loyalty of the lead, why he killed his father?!10) How come the son of the devil became mortal after swallowing the souls of all the ancient village's dead habitants?? As the devil's son, he must have been at least smart to know that that would make him beatable. And if he knows from the start, WHY DID HE DO IT??!! (My cousin's comment was: this is the dumbest devil I have ever seen!).11) So, Sam Elliot as the old ghost rider doesn't age, or does he age slowly?12) A truly irritating point; if Elliot can, after 150 years, use his superpower for one time only, THEN WHY HE USED IT TO BEAT THE LEAD'S MOTORCYCLE BY HIS FIREY HORSE??? I think he should have been wiser, as he sounds, and use that one last time in something more important like helping out fighting the evil, keeping it from taking over the world, NOT SHOWING OFF!!13) While his shoulder's torn skin was being sewing, Cage displayed no pain whatsoever; was that for assuring that his character turned into insensitive?, or plainly Cage forgot to act there?!14) The character of the lead's friend was useless, he was there for what?, and was killed for what either?! Clearly his existence, or nonexistence, sums up the tense of this movie between being a light likable blockbuster and the dark nature of the story it chose.15) Originally the character of the Ghost Rider isn't that catchy; I wasn't impressed by his looks or powers, and I couldn't sympathize with him, since he was a murderer anyway.16) Can anybody tell me how the lead defeated the devil in this movie? OK, he finished the sinner souls and that oaf little Satan, but I longed for a serious battle with the devil as the main source of evilness, and all what I have got was the lead doing everything that the devil asked him for, however with anger and nervousness!17) The lead's idiot speech at the end: 'I'll fight you.. in the sequel.. and in the next sequel.. and maybe in a TV show too!'. After watching a movie by all of these problems, I refused such a provocatively ambitious move!The score, or the aftermath, is 8 to 17. It wanted to be entertaining, but many reasons, topped by Cage's make-up as younger version of himself, pushed it to be between average and campy. This movie, unlike its lead, couldn't defeat its devil; the one which makes the B-movies so badly B!P.S: In the movie's last shot, Cage looks to us with a completely jesting look, winking to us: 'Don't take it seriously, I didn't for that matter!'.",Null,0,2,6 May 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," Why it is The 'Last' Anyway ?!
","I remember, in 2002, checking (Bryan Singer)'s page on IMDb, to read about futuristic pre-production projects like X Men 3 and X Men 4. Then, after 4 whole years I knew that (Singer) left, with nearly all the technical team of the first 2 X Men movies, to make Superman Returns. Furthermore, they made the third installment of X-Men already with another director, new technical team, and a pressing - incomprehensible - desire to terminate the X Men's cinematic series!The first movie was astonishing. The second was more astonishing. Now this one got nothing to do with the level of its antecedents, with many not flaws, rather 'crimes', along the way!There are slight matters. For one is the number of the unused new characters; that can fill at least 2 movies. The thing about them is that they are all amazing. So their uniqueness deepened the bad irony of their swift appearance. Simply there is a certain descent when it comes to writing this time. Just listen to Magneto's lines to feel that well. Add to that things like the CGI that has been used to de-age (Patrick Stewart) and (Ian Mckellan) at the intro scene. It transformed them both into a silly joke!Then, the sins. There are plenty of idiot events and stupid excuses. Sometimes the matters run crazily and in disgraceful way. For instance, Scott is murdered, suddenly and cheaply, just to assure that Jean became uncontrollable!!! Believe it or not, he didn't have the chance to leave respectfully after a good fight, or even a memorable scene. Let alone that we didn't have the chance to see that in the first place (just his glasses flying = he's murdered!). Then what about Jean's glorious returning back to life! That could be the easiest scene ever written at all; Scott, angrily, beams towards the sea, and Habra Kadabra she's flying out of the water alive, unharmed, and dry?! Welcome to X Men 3's silliest joke (or what was about to make the movie as one!). Annoying question: If she was alive in a cocoon, why she didn't come out earlier, especially while having all of these *recent* powers?!!Speaking of which, what will surely make you frown is the fact that it's impossible for Jean to have all of these powers (did death give her that???!!!). And there is nothing mentioned about her schizophrenic disorder, or her appalling self-destructive alter ego, before. Actually, the scene of (Patrick Stewart) as professor X telling that to (Hugh Jackman) as Wolverine pushed me to pity some actors for what Hollywood forces them to do or say sometimes! Still the greatest moment of absurdity that this movie has is when Jean kills professor X; who's smiling so unintelligibly while his death?? It's needless to notice how many unintelligible things this movie is crowded with!And why not some extra goofy stuff as well: Magneto lost his powers, then at the last shot he's moving a piece of metal?? Xavier is dead then, after the closing credits, he's talking through another person?? I believe the question marks aren't necessary since the movie makers, or accurately the producers, wanted to repair their wrongs, proving that there might be a sequel (or a TV spin-off), and lightening the load of sad nonsense that they made throughout the movie!The main conflict was brilliant. I loved the hard choice that the script shows about giving up whatever distinguishes you between the people, to be normal among the very people; so is the gift a disease to be cured from, or something to live with and show off? Also the sequence of killing Xavier, the director got to be proud of that. But the problem is.. there wasn't more! In general, it doesn't utilize a lot of its powers, and deals awfully melodramatic with the others, to end up as poor, forced, and disappointing.It's not X Men part 3. It's X Men: the murder and the weak swan song. It is clear that the producers wanted to wrap it up anyway, anyhow, so they axed the series by this hasty end, canceled part 4, and attended to the prequels after. However, I'm still asking, after experiencing a big success, why to make a last stand?! It's more like a rough 'stand aside', and even not with a decent farewell that could be a fair climax for the previous 2 movies.See Wolverine getting out to one of the school's balconies meaninglessly before the last shot; he got grouchy look up his face mostly for this blank finale of a movie!..Even (Singer) didn't make a great Superman movie in the same year!",7,0,3,31 January 2010
Hellboy," A Movie, Not Comics !
","During the whole 2000s, I didn't get the best of times out of the superhero movies' rush (or rather rash!).Scarce times when I liked ones of them. It got something to do with having a good script, a clever directing or not. Also I can't stand certain faces in such movies like Keanu Reeves (The Matrix), Tobey Maguire (Spiderman), Ben Affleck (Daredevil), etcetera.Here, I caught myself loving it. As imaginative fantasy, or solid action, it hit the mark perfectly. Let alone some elements that really were higher than any of their likes in other similar movies.When I listen to Marco Beltrami's engaging music score, I know so well that he loved the movie very much. Feel this dealing with the story by the music where you'll find: denying the hero's presence, the sense of expatriation, the delicate love (Hellboy's father, or girl), the pride of being different, so the greatness of that different hero despite his difference.Very few times that a script based on comics managed to present the whole history of its main characters, their world's details, and one hot adventure as well, being that powerful and entertaining in the same time. I remember only (Superman - 1978), (X Men - 2000), and now I can add (Hellboy) with a script that was written by the director himself (Guillermo del Toro).The directing didn't rely on being crazily showy, or roughly choppy. (del Toro) is a moviemaker who doesn't just know his instruments well, but also understands that making thrill isn't about CGI or special sound effects only, the man goes deep to show us humans not robots, pushes us to touch and smell more than to see, making great action however with scene of humor, and a bleeding hero not a video game with metallic characters and cases, so he succeeded eventually in creating a movie not comics.I loved the way fantasy is made out of history, because it's smart, and because it shows a point of view in history. Believe it or not, anything other than what you already know by heart could be believable!, and take it from me as someone who studied history for 4 years of his life!Since The Last Supper (1995), I knew that (Ron Perlman) was a good actor, despite how much he was misused in many Hollywood trite roles. So, here, he was distinct, reminding me of some action movies with old heroes. I love that, it's adorable for so many reasons: it makes you feel good about yourself if you're old, or not; as you feel that even being a 60 year old isn't scary at all! Also, it gives you something else the young charming princes of our time (the Affleck style!).(John Hurt) pulled it off to the max, handling it with heavy understanding, not as any might do; considering it another commercial flick for kids anyway. He was more like the movie itself; serious despite the unserious nature of it. With honest performance like that, and elements as good as these, this kind of movies could be appropriate to be watchable for causes else the action or the imagination, giving it the magical touch to differ from any takeaway superhero!About faults: I didn't feel at all that the lead was being seduced at the end, whereas his devilish side wasn't found in the first place, so that part of self- conflict or good / bad irony wasn't served at all. And what about an evil man, (Rasputin), who wants to destroy the world as it's just a worth destroying world?? I saw that this absolute-evil-for-evil is a weak motive. Another yet minor points: if Hellboy can make people revive from death, the way he did with the Russian annoying corpse, why he didn't do the same with his father?, or how all the people in the subway saw him indeed while his being was a national secret? Over and above, I hated the last 2 phrases: 'What makes a man? It's his choices. Not the way he starts things, but the way he ends them!!' Actually, that was too far for the story and Shakespearian in the wrong place!Save some of the most loyal sticky and ugly creatures, including (Blue), it's fun, as nothing like any easy Superhero movie where being merchandise is the point. At last, I recall one of my friends saying why he loved the movie: 'This super guy is something else, he gets beaten, suffers pain, and sneers at himself!'. Am I add 'he's a desperate lover, who has a noble sadness, and no handsomeness'. Simply, this is why I believe (Hellboy) will live long.P.S: (David Hyde Pierce), who's better known as (Dr. Niles Crane) from the TV sitcom (Frasier), did the vocal performance of (Abe Sapien) or (Blue). So while the whole world recognized his voice easily, why his name was 'uncredited'?!",7,0,0,28 January 2009
Good Will Hunting," Unbearable !
","10 years ago I've watched it. And it gave me only pain ever since. Pure and clear, I hate this movie. Rather, what's here to love?! Let me tell you, the moment when (Robin Williams) was talking about his wife who farted till she waked herself up, the joke of the girl in the café about old people's love, the stupid never-ending lecture about genius guys (which seems copied, as it is, from many books), all of that are little instances for how disgusting and boring this movie is. Actually, this is what lived from it with the poor me. And when it comes to its cast, then let me bleed with hate; (Ben Affleck) is underrated actor, he is, since he isn't hated enough! I just can't stand (Minnie Driver) as an actress. And (Matt Damon) is so cold and unconvincing in mostly all what he does. There is a good story there, but totally murdered by adolescent script and provocatively mute direction. Nothing is beautiful in this movie. And while it's supposed to be touchy, it totally isn't. Save the scene of (Affleck) talking about missing his friend, I didn't enjoy anything. Enough to say that after its ending, I blamed myself hardly for setting all through it, and after 10 years I still do. Without further ado, and to be incredibly objective; THIS MOVIE ISN'T FOR ME.",1,30,63,30 June 2010
The Mist," Darabont builds the tension right, but not the ending !
","After watching this, I found myself saying ironically: 'Man is the stupidest sane creature in the world!'. Something good to quote, huh?!This is - finally - a horror that has something to present beside its gore. Actually, it may be a movie about the human in the modern age; which happens to be a horror. Just remember that it's written and directed by (Frank Darabont) to know well that it's not another time filler slasher. (Darabont) wrote and directed before (The Shawshank Redemption) which was - as the same as (The Mist) - based on a book by (Stephen King). What (Darabont) did there, he does here, in terms of making something deep, with something thrilling.A group of middle class people is imprisoned in local grocery store, being all besieged by unknown danger that turns out to be huge lethal bugs. It's outwardly a disaster / sci-fi / horror movie, but inwardly about that supermarket community, its fears, expatriation and aberration. That consuming society is all about eating and drinking. They are selfish, living as strangers, and never done anything together unless shopping. That grocery store became the only spot where they meet together, and thus represented their being itself. So when they are trapped together, their hidden facts are quickly shown. From class struggle and spiritual emptiness, to psychological complexes and plain cowardice. Being confused is the surface only, which develops some thrill to watch. But being stupid is the core, which demands some time to contemplate.While the movie showcases many characters, it doesn't go deep in them. It just showcases their deeds. That wasn't enough according to a movie wants to go behind the surface I think. However, the most horrible shortcoming that this movie has is its ending. It wanted to say that human is a headlong, desperate, and so dumb creature. Unfortunately that was made in unconvincing way. The lead was an ideal action hero from the start. I didn't notice anything irrational about him. His thinking and doing showed nothing but intelligence and boldness. So when he did what he did at the end; that was totally bizarre. It was more than obvious that the script pushed him to do it, so the intended moral would be complete. But to 'push', in terms of good writing, is bad. To 'build' is the needed, which this script didn't really care about. It throws its pure perception in our faces without much attention to rooting it dramatically first. It seems to be that not going deep into the characters is the actual, and only, problem this movie has.On the contrary, the rest of the movie is near to flawless. Artistically, it is well done. The directing orchestrated all the elements to make a solid horror, and philosophical testimony, all while having limited budget as well. In a rare time, the shaken camera managed to be smartly realistic and no annoying. The tense was about being tangible throughout. The CGI was thoroughly designed and moved. Their uniqueness along with truthfulness were another rare matter. The monstrous bugs can be read as a part of the characters' world's rot. Imagine what kind of insects that live in a filthy place, so accordingly imagine how big that place itself could be to have insects as the ones we saw (gives you a hint to how this movie pictures our world!). Surely, that harmonizes fine with the supermarket community theme whereas it divides those consumers' town into grocery store and one big dump around. The performance was into the point, however quite wronged by the script. The characters were stereotypical ghosts, with no creativeness. For a clear instance, the heroine is a good woman, and that's it! Talking isn't this movie's talent. It was about doing, which is good, but not to a degree where the characters seem underdeveloped.Yes, believe it or not, unlike endless ordinary horror movies, the title has a wily pun. This is about the mist inside the mind of today's human who used to consume more than build, feed on joys of life instead of living that life, and fear as a substitute for faith. Being lost in that haze bemused the compass of reasonableness, ended any hope and easily killed the lead's kid by the lead's own hands. That's what this movie has in mind. The thing is the movie didn't mind about it much. So while trying to add something extra to a genre movie, something intellectual and critical, (The Mist) wasn't plenary. (Darabont), who stipulated earlier that the production company must not change his end, didn't play that end rightly.In brief: A breathtaking and thought-provoking horror. Yet, if the thought-provoking side was as well made as the breathtaking side, this could have been one of the best movies in the last decade. Alas, as a scriptwriter, (Darabont) said that human was stupid, but not in a perfectly 'smart' way!",7,0,4,19 June 2012
The Bourne Legacy," 'Like a door that keeps revolving, in a half forgotten dream' !
","OK, there is nothing new here. I saw (Rachel Weisz) running with a guy through many action sequences before in (Chain Reaction). I saw a long motorcycle chase before in (Torque). And I saw the matter of rogue secret agent on the run, being monitored by high CIA execs, who damn him all the way, due to his permanent elusion from them, obviously in 3 previous (Bourne) movies!Actually the plot is so silly. The secret intelligence program, by the name of 'Treadstone' or 'The Outcome' (the movie can't decide!), has been failed because its founder downloaded his birthday or something on YouTube! There is even more. As a result for that, the intelligence has to terminate ALL THE AGENTS AND THE DOCTORS OF THE PROGRAM!!!!! Now, this is silly and dumb. Why not reusing them for something else, after plastic surgery or anything?! So, if another secret got leaked, the CIA would terminate itself, killing all of its staff??!! What a drivel! And to fairly sum it up, the rest of the plot is just an excuse to watch the 2 leads running and running and running. And then, at an abrupt point, the movie ends, as if it's 'Hey, our time is up, we'll catch you later, with the answers, in the sequel. Bye Bye!'. Don't tell me that this didn't make you unsatisfied and provoked?!While this is, I think, an intro to a new Bourne series, it should have, at least, built some dramatic ground. However, drama, and characters, aren't things to be cared about or heard of in this territory! So don't shout 'How they forgot that writing a history for the lead, makes him more human, and makes the audience get attached to him as well?', or whine about 'Why they didn't elaborate on the story of the girl who he was using her name in his partner's fake passport?'. Because the movie-makers had no time for this or that. They just wanted to utilize the Bourne formula of super secret agent, who runs from his superiors, all over the world, doing some hot action while that, and wins at the end. However, I missed (Matt Damon). He provided some serious inner bitterness as the title character, strongly in the first movie, of which this one doesn't know how to make, or doesn't want to make!After putting the plot, or any seriousness, aside, what could be left? I know. Firstly, the very talented (Rachel Weisz). Although it's originally not a movie to 'act' in, only 'run', but (Weisz) did some good acting, mastering her role as emotionally stressed person, who found herself suddenly thrown in an ocean of blood, while not understanding a thing (surprisingly her lines were well-written). Secondly, (Jeremy Renner). There is some good fighting on his behalf. Not to mention that he looks so macho unlike (Matt the-forever-boyish Damon). And thirdly, some cool action with catchy directing. Other than this, there is no 'other than this'!The ultimate fact about this movie is that it is frankly empty. So, I kept asking questions about its reason of being; why to repeat the whole Bourne world again? It wasn't great world in the first place. And why not making a movie of its own, away from the legacy of Bourne? The answer: 1) it's Hollywood. It became lately like a pure merchant, and no artist, who sees just deals not movies. Therefore, whenever glimpses a movie with a box office glow, Hollywood must exploit it to the end of it (or us!). And 2) when it comes to ideas, they're bankrupt. Hence, prolonging Bourne's life, or rather name, could be good for another movie to keep the industry going on anyway. Apparently, the Windmills of 'Hollywood' Mind have become so boring, industrializing only more and more of air.So, accordingly, this is a project, a moneymaker, a commercial movie, with some action and thrill. And also, this is unnecessary sequel; unoriginal, repetitive, and deprived of anything unique. Undoubtedly, making it as a parody out of the Bourne trilogy should have been more creative and seductive to watch. But in another, more necessary, movie then.",Null,1,3,14 February 2013
Unknown," Have we become strange people in strange countries ?!
","OK, some said it's similar to (Frantic - 1988). Others said it's a complete rip-off from (The Bourne Identity - 2002). And I see that it looks like a better remake of a TV movie, starring (Alec Baldwin), named (Second Nature - 2003)!Well, to be fair, it has elements that apparently have been dealt with many times lately. However, it holds up nicely. The movie is a good thriller from start to finish. Only the storyline of the old detective, and how it ended, that was a bit forced (I still wonder about the link that led his killer to him!), and the never understood point about how the 2 leads came up with new passports at the last scene? (Liam Nieson) is an action star who wasn't discovered as such until his late fifties. But that has a lovely side since there aren't many action starts, from that category, in Hollywood of today, unless (Harrison Ford); who's not a favorite of mine, while (Nieson) is. (Diane Kruger) proved that she's an actress, not just a pretty girl like she was in (Troy - 2004). The directing is fine; it kept me thrilled. The action sequences are catchy, especially the car chase; being the movie's highest moment. And the cinematography was enjoyable and artistic, with green and dark blue image. I loved particularly that taste of gray ice in some parts; it embodied perfectly the case of coldness that the lead faced during the first 2 acts; which leads to the subject that did interest me the most in (Unknown).We have a lead that doesn't have an identity, doesn't remember his history, and doesn't have a faith in any human. Add to that, being chased by killers, as if it isn't enough to kill his past and presence, so his future is marked for death as well. It's a dark image for the human of today, living with no name or memory, no love or trust, no peace or home. Therefore, he's always strange in strange land. This sense of pressing, cruel and lasting alienation is so sensed in the list of movies with the same 'unknown' theme. Although they mostly dealt with it in the format of the spy action thriller, but its melancholic master crises is unmistakable, and its being as frequent in the past decades must mirror an origin in the factual life. It's some reading for the modern age's world, which pushes us to forget everything since it is all horrible, meeting the ultimate fate of being killed or killer, and disappointing the search for the most important question at all: Who Am I? which is - and don't consider it a coincidence - another movie, starring (Jackie Chan), from 1998, about a spy who lost his memory, and wants desperately to not be a stranger, choosing - in the same time - to do the right thing lastly!Winning knowing yourself can't be happened while you're alone. However, in the awfully cold circumstances that we live, you find yourself forcibly away and alone. Otherwise, you don't have a choice but to be a spy, who lives - at best - many lies after the other, lost in many foreign streets and faces, not enjoying anything real in his life except death. Ahh, we need a lot of carriage to love / do the right thing these days. See how underneath a thriller like that a lot of things, related to you and your life, boil. It's solely a reason to be attracted to such a movie, else being well made.",7,0,0,16 July 2011
The Illusionist," 'Shut Up.. And Let Us Watch The Show !'
","As I was watching this movie, I was telling myself: 'WAW.. Here is a new one for my list of the greatest 100 movies ever!'. But as the events went ahead, I found all the rest predictable, weak, and out of my high respected area. As the magnificent potentials of the movie went down to be just another entertaining Hollywood flick, but a bit bizarre and not as solid as its likes!There are lots of good points to talk about. For most of the time, the movie looked proficiently strong, rarely interesting, and wonderfully made. For instance, I loved the sly performance of (Edward Norton) as (Eisenheim), the majestic music of (Philip Glass), the fantastic deceptive cinematography of (Dick Pope) as an old silent movie with all the exact taste of magic and the adroit tribute for that age, that cinema and that kind of feelings in front of a fancy tale. And above all, the genius performance of (Paul Giamatti) as (Uhl).Basically the character of (Uhl) is so charming as the sincere inspector who is looking for the truth and bewitched by the magic too. He came from the bourgeoisie; being son of butcher like (Eisenheim) who is son of a carpenter, and deeply malcontent with great desire to fulfill justice. He loved and respected (Eisenheim)'s journey, defiance and adeptness; so no wonder to be the narrator of the story. He wanted to defeat the masters but not by magic, only by the law. I loved (Giamatti) performance, especially at the last scene where he was understanding, as well as enjoying, the whole trick at once in unforgettably astonishing scene.As for the script, I think, from subjective viewpoint, that this movie has truly marvelous dimensions whereas it can be a story about logical mind vs. creative imagination, powerful authority vs. clever art, or even unjust rich tyrants vs. wronged poor people. It's a bright story indeed where the poor artist can threaten a despotic leader, after awakening and excitation the public opinion against the injustice along with his smart ability, not only to entertain but also to get away with his victory as a public hero who had the superiority over the less intelligent rulers. See, it's thoughtful and amusing. But it wasn't made like this!The thing is the makers of the movie just abbreviated it to much simpler level, following the principle of 'I'm here just to entertain' which's a line said by (Eisenheim) at one point. The problem is that they made their own entertaining movie in a weak way!I hate to be the sound of mind here, but the magic of this movie contained some faults, and the illusionist's trick / the movie's twist was that obvious (at least for me!), not to mention the badness of its plot. And if you against me, just answer this: if the illusionist kidnapped the body of the alleged dead princess, then the imperial family buried who exactly?!, and if the prince was executed, then it confirms that the immaculate illusionist and his tender sweetheart are the actual killers of the story; whereas they were close to end somebody's life because a crime that he didn't commit or even think of!They're couple of offensive holes indeed, however I thought that with a little thinking from the movie's writer, they could've been more sturdy and convincing. As for the first hole, (Eisenheim) could put a real corpse instead of the sleepy princess, or make a delusion by so many ruses: the corpse was deformed, drifted by the current, or eaten by the fish.. whatever! And as for the other hole, we could have seen that the prince ruthlessly killed a girl before, or he was intending of killing that princess at one step, or anything but making him such a naive jealous guy who is just intrinsically madly in love!Actually, the movie's goal was nothing but making a delight romantic fairytale, with the exposed game of black frame around the image all the time; like an old magic lantern's show, as a pure nice deceiving vision. Unfortunately, it wasn't that perfect, with hasty script to disappointing degree. Though, I'll try to tell my mind what the princess told the over-thinking prince: 'Shut Up.. And Let's Watch The Show!'.So eventually there is some reality in illusion; as the illusionist creates fancy to the people and confirms the excellence of his class, and some illusion in reality; as the princess is still alive, however nearly nobody knows about it. But even with the movie's own faults, I see that the main message of it will be that the illusion is more enjoyable when we never think about it. And maybe it's the oldest message of Hollywood at all.",6,0,0,28 December 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Egypt is Not a Desert with 2 Men and a Camel !
","On the upside, the CGI wasn't too much. The editing wasn't hysterical like a lot of the American action movies recently. There are some dexterous moments like the attack at the wedding. (Laurence Fishburne) as the Surfer's voice was more charismatic and deep than the whole performances here. I loved giving the creator (Stan Lee) a cameo as a rejected wedding guest; it could be bitter self-irony as the writer is always deprived of being in the shooting location in Hollywood. It was better than seeing him in idiot cameos in Spider-man movies, where he always stands under a fallen balcony to rescue a kid! The best of it was its brilliant idea to see a matter of exchanging superpowers, and the marvelous sound effects which you wouldn't experience unless in a theater.But, on the downside, the action is lesser, (Jessica Alba) is unbearable as usual, and with yellow hair; she's even mega-unbearable, though she was sensitive enough to serve the uneasiness of her character. Putting in mind that the Silver Surfer can cut off any kind of industrial energy, so how come that all the cars in the street didn't stop while his flying over them after destroying the wedding?! There is a big mistake in terms of the climax, since it's too short, too deficient, and handled by only one person, not the whole team, which weakens what's supposed to be the movie's most important sequence, as well as lessened the total effect of the fun.Now the bigger mistake that poisoned the fun itself was that brief scene where (Chris Evans) is thrown faraway by the Silver Surfer to Egypt, like it's the end of the world already! I feel sick out of watching a lot of movies that deal with Egypt through one constant foolish look; where it is nothing but a primed, a desert, and 2 men with a camel! It's more like seeing America as a Red Indian, and a cowboy who's shooting him in the back! I was in the theater in Cairo, and once this scene took place, we all were in silence, rising eyebrows, then whispering sarcastically something like: Yeah, Hollywood.. it's typical!This is a sequel that didn't outclass its original. Director (Tim Story) managed to make it fine, but the script determined on being just another B-grade B-movie.All in all, not a bad movie, but really bad look!",7,2,5,29 November 2008
Men in Black II," Why It's Very '2' Indeed ?!
","Too short: The first was one of the 98 minutes' movies that really felt like more than that; due to its rich details, too many successive jokes, and good flashy sudden sequences. But on the other hand, this one is only 88 minutes time, and the 88 minutes type also!The surprise effect: When the first one came out, it was such a new genius formula for sci-fi action buddy-cop comedy, not to mention its smart ironic paranoia. So this time, along with the inferiority of that very formula's factors, you'd feel how it wasn't that completely new either.The fact that (Tommy Lee Jones) didn't act a bit in here: Actually he represented the ideal image for an-actor -in-Hollywood-who-had-been-forced-to-do-the-same-over-and-over-again kind of matters. And in a historically rebellious sort of attitude, he expressed his own objections against that by doing nothing at all in front of the camera. Like he tells them: 'Want a sequel?.. Well.. Here you are one right in your faces!'. Maybe this movie will be mentioned in the books of cinema history, where some actor patented the invention of being so frigidly dull as a perfect slap on the face of Hollywood's hackneying!It's lower: Although there was too many bizarre characters, but all in all the CGI wasn't as good as the original. It was so badly obvious at the big worm's sequence for instance. It was that low, as the movie's so visibly small budget. And you have to be disappointed when the movie's music video, (Will Smith)'s Black Suits Comin', looks so huge and impressive compared to the movie itself!The emptiness: The interesting paranoia is missing in this sequel. And unlike the origin story of part 1, this one has no equal events with the same momentum. And as for the drama, there is nothing new, or there is nothing!So that's why this movie will be always and forever number 2 as the ordinary numbering, and when it comes to make comparison with its original in quality as well. Though, it's nice fun if you want silly comics for an hour and a half.",Null,0,2,19 May 2008
Million Dollar Baby," Love Stories !
","This is a million dollar story. Amazing how this film looks simple while being deep. At first, I thought it was Rocky meets My Fair Lady, but I was wrong. It's not a Hollywood dream. It's rather a dream to make such a film in Hollywood of today.Look how it braids many lovely feelings together. There is a father to daughter love (Eastwood - a father without a daughter - to Swank), a daughter to father love (Swank - who lost her father early - to Eastwood), and a friend to friend love (Eastwood to Freeman, not forgiving himself for feeling responsible for the lost of the last's eye), and Freeman to Eastwood (giving the truth that the last desperately needed at the end, summarizing the hard situation smartly within the speech of 'I didn't have my chance').However, to some extent, I couldn't quite understand the character of (Danger), the semi-mentally handicapped kid, who doesn't get any tired of dreaming the impossible dream. Maybe he symbolized the stubbornness of the title's character, the incapacity yet the survival's power of Freeman, and the need to be loved of Eastwood; it's obvious that (Danger) insists to go to the gym to belong, and feel that there are people to help him, even if help him dreaming.The directing didn't try to be pedant. The old fox Eastwood, who by the way becomes a better director as he ages, understood earlier that this is a story to be told by the least tricks. And how it's originally built on the basis of acting. So he led the whole thing so calmly and romantically. The pace is basically acute but significant, sad yet no mourner; simply similar to Eastwood's character. The cinematography is so expressive; notice how the areas of white decrease along the way, till they nearly end, paralleling with the state of pain and losing life. I especially loved the moment of the deal's handshake between the 2 leads; the lighting around them was like emanating dawn, or a full moon in the dark of the night. The final outcome is what deserves to be called literally: an instant classic.As for the problems, I didn't like the performance of Eastwood the actor. I don't know whether it was his busyness in front and behind the camera in the same time?, or his old school of acting where the star's stardom leads and rules? Both ways, while being a high point of his career as an actor, his performance here looked the least capable amongst the ones delivered by these 2 great actors who he directed.Then, it's the spoken narration of Freeman's character. Firstly, I don't think that that poor, not well cultured, ex-boxer (Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris) has these literary abilities, or these awfully sentimental expressions, being a F. Scott Fitzgerald-ish for most of the time. And secondly, that very narration seemed kind of superfluous, where the film was better without it; as if it was added after the whole thing was complete, to lighten some of its tragic taste. Moreover, the reason why Eastwood's daughter behaved the way that we saw was vogue; that wasn't for the sake of anything.And finally, Eastwood's music score for the main theme was so similar to 'Kate's Theme' which's another score that he wrote, however for his previous movie (Absolute Power - 1997). Although both mirror a sensitive feeling of love from father to his daughter, but whenever this one is played we refer to that other movie.Anyway, I always say that Eastwood's cinema is mostly about the same theme all along: having a second chance. Here, it can't be more clear. We watched a father who got a second chance to have the daughter who he wants, a friend who lost life with lots of money, but got another with a friend who loves him, and a girl who got a second father who loves her, even if that meant killing her. The film showcases all of that in a bittersweet way. It feels like a very good novel, in which I explore the inside of the characters, sense their humanity, while enjoying every detail, and not feeling any bore.Looking simple while being deep is what genius is all about. When it comes to that matter, (Million Dollar Baby) is no exception.",8,1,3,24 May 2010
Shrek 2," Original Sequel !
","This is sure the exploitive sequel, and it isn't! It's not a riddle. It's the Hollywood sequel yet at its best condition ever: Better Than its Original. The first was fine, nice and evolving movie; where the folk story is reversed and still amusing. Here, it's the next level.The creative irony this time contains firstly the semblance / substance case: Shrek the ogre / Shrek the lover, the godfather kind fairy / the conspirator evil witch, even Puss in Boots's childish gaze / his nature as tough sword player. Then, secondly, it smartly applies to higher issues like: the publicity of the godfather fairy, the credibility of the TV news, the power of the king, etc.This movie achieves, in a lovely spirit, being a celebration of movies as the modern fairy tales, so Hollywood is the Very Very Far city; with too many references to endless movies and TV shows. Plus, it achieves being a hot self-mockery, where the looks isn't always true, with - for instance - moments like literally scavenging some stars off the red carpet, because they're simply garbage!It's the first movie's point of view all over again, but not with the paradox of only ogre and knight this time. It's about the 'ugly' truth and the gaudy falseness, concentrating on one whole community / Hollywood as out-of-reality royalty vs. one honest genuine hero. It was clever to display how he exposes with his real ugliness all the fake beauty of the others, clarifying how that world misses this innate behavior or sacrificing love. And it was merciful not to see him beaten at the end, because this is a Hollywood fairytale after all!However, the best of it was its ability to be such a modern fairytale in the same time too. Despite the unoriginality of some elements that the plot uses from old folk stories (the midnight's thrill, the magical kiss, the frog prince..), or from new folk stories (Ghostbusters, Mission Impossible, Matrix..)-it managed to be an original fun fare on all the levels; as a parody, a satire, and a lovely story about love.I didn't like the recording of the voices. It was pretty obvious, especially at the first act, that the whole cast just dictate their lines separately, then somehow that have been gathered. The warmth of the actors being apposite each others is totally lost. Sometimes the scene's dialogue is short amputated sentences coming from one actor to not meet their opposite's passion.Another shortcoming which's the design of the characters. They are so 'Live' to provocative extent. I think the history will say someday that at the first age of the CGI, the graphic movies.. whatever the name is, there was an affection for mimicking the human image and motion, to a perfect extent. It's a healthy affection, but I didn't like it in here, being unfunny and a sullen factor among the sweet faces and reactions of Shrek and Donkey.Add to that, some of what seemed as misplaced stuff such as seeing Puss while parodying Jennifer Beals from (Flashdance - 1983), Shrek's farting?? This is like being rude for rudeness!, using Julie Andrews's name more than Julie Andrews's acting talent or singing talent, or modeling the queen's face, even if accidentally, a la Carmen Elektra's which wasn't comfortable to tell you the truth!Aside from good original details, like the middle ages' meal, there are other beautiful ones that deal, or rather play, with the old stories' legacy brilliantly, reusing it in new originality such as: The bar of the stories' misfit characters. Refusing the 'show' of transforming the princess, a la Cinderella, into someone else herself by wicked powers and for ill-intentioned purposes. Discovering that the king is basically a frog (so how to disapprove Shrek?!); therefore he remembers well his first kiss! And most of all: the talking mirror, from Snow White, in the city's TV; that could mean whether that that truthfulness' figure is now working as just an intermission voice on TV, or that the TV viewers will be as mad as Snow White's stepmother!The third act has the movie's best sequences and dynamic center. The parallel editing where we watch the hero's attempts to save his love in the nick of time, and the dance of the heroine with the hero's opponent-was super, let alone how the new arrangement of Bonny Taylor's I Need a Hero expressed the situation but roused it. It's a Hollywood big finish, comes in a way that makes you ask; how many times did cinema barrow from legends, folk stories, novels, etc? Anyhow, this movie exploits this fact enjoyably.Shrek 2 does the hardest; it's a sequel better than its original, and it's amusing as well as satiric. So for me, it's 'original' with all the glorious meanings of the word.Finally, 'Sir Justin'?! OH GOD, that's a good one, a very good indeed!",7,0,1,15 August 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," An Album For B Movies: Vol. 1 !
","Chapter 1: 2 is like 3, they're all numbers, but how to use them?!Drama, in its core, is known and invariable. All what the artist can do about it is just playing it differentially, trying to make it as amusing as they can. It's the eternal game which's named art. So nothing, mainly, can be original. It's just the surface that can be one. Actually, every now and then, some work just tells us that, openly and purely. For instance, Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! (2001) said it through very old and even trite story, yet Luhrmann showed us his version glamorously. But in Kill Bill 1, the problem is that Tarantino presents the surface as being taken also from other works that he's obsessed about, and wants to pay them the biggest homage. Therefore, in this deal, the whole thing lacks originality.. Badly.Chapter 2: A,B,C.. I don't like LUCY!Here, Tarantino is nothing but movies freak that got the chance to make one. However, he is doing it as a devoted viewer more than creative artist. It's a B movie that mimics other B movies with its stylistic characteristics and details by great passion and loyalty. But the final result wasn't that unique as a movie and homage.The imaginative world of it didn't work for me. It's immersed in anything that doesn't guide or charm the viewer, missing fine original details for itself. Even the bride's yellow track-suit was worn by Bruce Lee in Game of Death (1978)! And I began to believe that her brown jacket at the start could be a reference to Jacky Brown (1997) or something! It like a silly competition more than a movie, to ask eagerly: from what movie this line, this fight, or this costume came from?! So it's a cocktail of movies that Tarantino adores, which's not necessarily something that we must adore too!I could be the only man on earth that was so annoyed out of using mostly non-original soundtrack. True that Tarantino was achieving some dream, making distinct flavor, and rather summarizing the whole matter; the way Moulin Rouge's soundtrack did. But, with the exception of (Twisted Nerve) by Bernard Herrmann at Daryl Hannah's intro, it didn't eventually manage to be magical element. As if the whole movie is like Hanna's character; whistles, however unstoppably, themes from endless old movies and TV shows, pushing you out of it to them. That assured the lack of originality vexingly sometimes.And when it comes to a revenge story, I don't love hearing bad dialogue, without comic relief, being all the time in the company of Uma Thurman OR seeing Lucy Liu! Some of the action was well done, but all of it seemed absurd. The black and white cinematography wasn't good at all. And the sequence of the Japanese cartoon looked so out of the mood, as just here because the director wanted that, more than the story for instance, I deemed it a treachery to the B-movie persona of it, being a part of honoring program, or so artistic act of another film!So, it was unenjoyable and uneven. I just found myself preferring the original works over this pretentious hamburger of a movie!Chapter 3: Kill Time!Tarantino adores nonsense, and he just represents it in new forms. It could confirm that nothing is original but the way of dealing, YET this time, like mostly every time with him, his dealing wasn't that original nor great. It's average, being like a parody without laughs. When Spielberg and Lucas once wanted to pay homage to the 1930s adventure movies, they made a cinematic series named (Indiana Jones). Here, Tarantino made something where style kills the narration, without much originality, making a toy that gives the biggest kick for only its creator. He didn't either put something serious in the unserious mix of it; in fact, I'm searching for one reason that can make it stand for a second watching else killing the time, but I'm finding none. So, for anyone out there, who want to kill the time with an action movie, here's a pure action movie for you, so proud of being a 'B' one too.Chapter 4: Overrated!I don't know how it can be a homage to the Blaxploitation movies because of one violent black woman in it??!! So, could the name 'Bill' be a homage to Bill Clinton or Bill Cosby?! Ok, let's say that overrating is one crime done by ignorant viewers and reviewers which forever irritates me!Chapter 5: They must build a statue for Tarantino in Hong Kong!One value for it is that it glorifies certain Asian cinema industry in a way that no American movie did before. Tarantino admits his absolute love for specific school in making the gory work by the most practical way ever, undertaking making an album for cheap B-movies in a form of another one. But this volume was so dry and tasteless I can tell you that...To Be Continued with Kill Bill: Vol. 2.",5,0,0,29 March 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," So it's 'Charlie' this time not 'Willy Wonka'?.. WRONG !
","I asked myself a lot why Tim Burton made this movie? Is he only making a living through movies? Not Burton that I know. Is he trying to remake a story with a precise different point of view? This is what I didn't find here at all! So is he making the studio what it wants, so the studio would give him later the chance to do what he wants? That's the closest I can get to a satisfying answer!It's just another one from the mammoth mound of remakes that Hollywood, the bankrupt Hollywood lately, produces in the 2000s just to produce. And, unfortunately, it didn't even get the Burton stamp on it, being tasteless and unsurprising, with nothing that original as well. So you can say confidently that this is Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes (2001): Part 2!It was between so ordinary and provocative, and I think ordinary Burton's movie is provocative enough! For instance, about the provocation part, you'll find Johnny Depp performing badly in a rare time. Just think of it; Willy Wonka, as we knew by this very movie, was one self-made millionaire, who left his home while he was a kid, to end up building an empire of candy industry, however, Depp's performance showed Wonka as one sissy brat; who's close to Michael Jackson's image as an inordinate weirdo only!The movie invests the CGI in the worst way ever. Making all the Oompa Loompa as one ugly and glum midget was a historical stroke of stupidity. Aside from his too silly emotionless face, that was so BORING. It was mere showing off. And it didn't serve the darkness of the story; it served my tedium out of it. Let alone that seeing Deep Roy parodying Ester Williams's big numbers was completely awful and sickening!Overall, it misses imagination. I didn't find anything that new to savor. And it's quite a shame when that is said about a movie by the one who made once Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, or Mars Attacks! I liked the ominous intro of the burning dolls, but the thing is there wasn't more.Still the biggest irritation comes from the deception of making the movie this time about Charlie not Wonka. Whereas we've watched carefully Mr. Wonka's history so his gratuitously nauseating journeys, his psychological problems, even the way he gets saved at the end, while Charlie was more present in the old movie, with songs and memorable moments. It's more than obvious that this is a Johnny Depp movie from start to finish, and it wasn't interesting as its likes too.Moreover: Danny Elfman's music lacked its own uniqueness. Surely this movie isn't appropriate for kids; enough to remember the pupils come out of the dolls' eyes while they're on fire! And Albert Finney, Anthony Hopkins, Paul Newman were considered for the role of Grandpa Joe?? And in early 2003, Gregory Peck was offered the role!! How the movie makers got the guts to consider all of these icons, or even offer the role to a legend as big as Peck, while it's basically a trash of a role that got totally nothing to its actor??!!Most of the songs were OK. And it was good to see the history of Wonka, criticizing the TV, or utilizing Wonka's elevator as a fancy transportation. It was even very good to cast Dracula himself, Christopher Lee, as his terrifying father. Yet all of that didn't give me the original movie that I wished for. It was only the 'new' message of the family being more important than money that this movie succeeded at delivering, but without any comic moments or even enjoyably dark ones.When you watch useless remakes everyday is something really woeful, but when it comes to one of the few REAL ORIGINAL movie makers too; so that deserves a stark WOE. It's not Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, or Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it's Tim Burton and the Remakes Factory, being the least amusing and the true melancholic in the bunch.",5,1,4,10 August 2009
Mission: Impossible II," Goofy Little Bond !
","It's not bad, it's only goofy!(Tom Cruise) was having the worst of times, in 2 years he didn't make anything but (Kubrick)'s big turkey (Eyes Wide Shut - 1999), and it wasn't worth it too!, needing a box office hit badly. So how about the great TV show that he participated in disfiguring it 4 years ago under the name of (Mission: Impossible) or (The adventures of James Bond's short American brother). Therefore, let's make (Disfiguring: Part 2)!(John Woo) seems so happy to work with Mr. Hollywood (Tom Cruise) himself, directing a Mission Impossible flick (it's like having the American citizenship!), being on a mission to rescue (Cruise) from the bomb that (Eyes Wide Shut) was, at any cost. But (Woo) here was more like a director of nearly 10 video clips, showing off his technique, enjoying creating something visually catchy at every one of them, though they are still clips. The real problem was that he freely gave everyone and everything a bigger shadows, so with smaller script; they seemed all funny!OK, for instance, he was highly sentimental in the wrong place, or by the wrong way; (Cruise) falls in love with (Thandie Newton) during a Spanish dance in slow-motion like living a poem, rolling on a cliff at their cars like a ballet, both make love while some public exuberant ceremony, Oh like fate is conducting the relationship as heavenly music, or a great rapt love that was meant to be. Surely (Cruise) will dump her like trash before she knows about it in the next movie! It runs in the family, as his older English brother used to do during 40 years already. The funniest bit when (Cruise) had to hug her at one park in the end, after he saved the world, while no sound around them but the holy moment of their true love; Oh Nonsense!The script wasn't respectable enough. Look at the first scene that gathered the 2 leads together (the attempt to steal at the hotel), the script just cut the scenes where we're supposed to understand that (Cruise)'s character is disguising as security's manager just to get right to the action part! Actually it looked naïve, before anticlimactic. But not to wonder. As (Robert Towne) had declared that much of his script was written around action scenes that (Woo) told him he wanted to direct?? That makes clear that this was the most toy of a movie for (Woo).Let alone how (Cruise) is not that convincing as Bond, or as action hero in the first place, whatever all the moves he does, all the motorcycles he rides, and all the sunglasses in the world! I even can't believe that he may be a result of an affair for (Bond)'s father in America with some short girl; he's close to be a (Bond)'s son only by correspondence! So, farewell for any credibility (read: unity with the lead).I hated that Russian scientist character who got nothing to do but saying one of the drama's rules 'Every search for a hero must begin with something that every hero requires; a villain!', (Thandie Newton) was here only for being 'the girl', though she didn't have enough charisma or charm. It got more ironic while the way she was portrayed cinematically like a dream. To add all the fuel, there was no whit of chemistry between her and (Cruise), like they were a team of (Bud Abbott) and (Bud Abbott)! So, for me, one of the movie's highest absurd points was seeing the good guy and the evil guy, fighting madly over her. Fairly, I think she's a real good actress, but she didn't fit for nearly everything in this.So, the script is a little childish, and with (Cruise)'s presence, plus (Woo) being seriously romantic in a video game, it's 'very' childish. The whole matter shrank into another crazy B-movie with shattering glass, cool yet fool chases, and one long jump into one building, managing not to be a spy movie, or kind of decent thriller like Part 1, or a case of 'one-team, one-mission' a la' the original TV show which was originally murdered since the beginning, and nothing remained from it else the game of the masks! Even the director's trademarks, such as the slow-motion during the action, seemed silly, meaninglessly repetitive, and sometimes laughable with the doves while (Cruise) rises; it looked like a perfect spoof indeed especially with that operatic soundtrack!I'm sick of reading information like 'The film's final cut clocked in at 3-1/2 hours. So the studio balked, and the final length was abbreviated to 120 min'! I read the same thing about other flops like (The Avengers - 1998), or (Daredevil - 2003). It's flimsy excuse for the plot holes, and flimsier excuse to sell the DVD!Lastly, what could be good in this? I'll tell you: The sunglasses part at the intro for its novelty; I've been totally surprised when a lot of viewers loved it and still remember it + The guitar music at the Spanish dance + (Anthony Hopkins) as the 'uncredited' Mission Commander (Swanbeck); in moments like these you long for someone who can act, someone you know by heart that he has a meaning!(Mission: Impossible II) is suitable for 2 mindless hours, if you can stand its formula's elements, and (Cruise) being on black motorcycle, wearing black jacket, black sunglasses (How can he aim right, then?!), while his long black hair is flying in slow-motion. It's not (James Bond) nor (Mission: Impossible); it's an Impossible Bond!",5,0,2,29 January 2009
World Trade Center," The Victims
","In his previous movie (JFK - 1991), (Oliver Stone) talked about a true tragedy that happened to America, namely the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy, accusing the arms dealers, the CIA, the mafia, and maybe the presidential foundation at the time; namely the dark powers which control and rule for their own sakes whatever the loss of anyone. This time, he talks about the true tragedy only.It's heartwarming, sometimes excruciating, movie, but with noting to say unless the meaning of goodness inside all, and how life is precious, so precious thing to be wasted without all the love that we can give. It's pretty well-meaning work. (Stone) was pure, simple, and compared to his other movies so tame and romantic. He didn't go to explore the reasons or judge anyone. Instead, he made a movie about a man who discovers that he used not to look at his wife's eyes as much as he must of late. Maybe it's a way to learn, on a very human level, a lesson from the catastrophe that hit the Americans in 2001.It's finely scripted, directed, and acted. The details are many and tiny; hence fascinating. The true story, that the movie selected, got all what a Hollywood movie needed; a huge disaster, beautiful buddy-thing under awful circumstances, the operation to save, and sure the happy ending. And it's what the audience needed at the time to express a lot of suppressed emotions as well.Anyway, I loved (World Trade Center). It's rich and powerful sad movie, where thousands of innocent people suffer what they totally didn't deserve, being victims of the ones who are 'trading' the 'world' for their own profits. It reminded me of (Stone)'s trilogy of Vietnam where many Americans were sent to hell for a crime they didn't commit. Maybe in a crime was committed to them and others, and by not too far criminals than the same profiteering powers that caused many disasters, big part of 9/11 is one of them. So the world had become a Trade, and we all merchandise to be sold. This movie arouses returning to the human side. That's a great step yet before knowing who are selling?, and what's they earned? Maybe that's what (Stone) would have done in his next movie (W.). I hope that he questioned and answered there what was waited from him here, and when he didn't, his fans left disappointed.It is to everyone died in, or survived from, the tragedy as simply they are all victims. Though still the saddest matter, for me, is that more thousands of innocent victims all over the world, especially in Palestine and Iraq, don't have the luxury of making movies, with big budget and stars, about their daily loss and tragic history, or even caring about saving them in the first place.",Null,0,1,14 February 2010
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Excessiveness is no virtue !
","Simply, it's The Avengers (2010) on steroids, red bull, and LSD! We have the same heroes, yet with additional ones, an army of CG shots, too much action it's going to make you sick, and the hugest amount of twaddle, prattle, and babble you'll ever experience. Well, dear writer / director Joss Whedon, excessiveness is no virtue!The action sequences run so snappily as if The Flash directed them. It's like riding a loose roller-coaster, I was shouting 'Please, make it slower!'. Whether somebody pressed the Fast-Forward button while Play is on, or it has the most irrational editing of 2015 (Here's a challenge for you: Try to find Julie Delpy in this movie!).Once the action is over, the dialogue is endless to the extent where you feel, rather live the fact, that this is a talk show more than an action movie. Bore was a superhero in this movie, and he killed it. When I recall that 15 minutes sequence in the movie's middle, where they go to the safe house, I fall asleep instantly. GOD! It's where The Avengers meets Little House on the Prairie!!There was some relief, scary one. The tragedy is that the comic one-liners were horrible, and delivered horribly as well. No actor cared to be a bit funny while performing them. They're all in rush, forgetting to give an iota of 'feeling' along the way. Actually, the performance got robotic sometimes, look at Captain America, Thor and Stark while their talk right before the ending, they were phoning in their lines in incredible frigidity!Like the first movie, the evil guy's soldiers are still alike, and so easy to kill. Speaking of continuous downsides from the first movie, I'm still asking: What Hawkeye and Black Widow have to do with The Avengers in the first place?! THEY'RE NOT SUPER ANYTHING FOR GOD'S SAKE! And for a new downside, that maybe will continue in next movies; They made Captain America curse!!And then we get to the LSD issue. Yes, I mean the character of 'Vision'. Who is that guy? And how he's even born? So Stark is capable of CREATING people now??!!As for any pros, the CGI and all of the imaginative details were excellent and enjoyable.Sadly, Whedon had a lust for too much speaking, too fast action, producing heavy exhaustion in a form of a movie. I was shocked when knew that the first Avengers movie ran for 2 hours and 23 minutes, and this one ran for 2 hours and 21 minutes. The shock wasn't that this one is shorter; it was that it feels like 3 days already! To tell you the bitter truth, I slept in front if it 3 times. THREE TIMES!! It didn't happen with any other movie, not to mention a supposedly entertaining blockbuster. So I had to re-watch it, while fighting sleep, to write these words.The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron mixed Marvel's lead characters, and good action sequences, with DC's grittiness, and serious drama mambo jambo, and the result is unbearable fat movie. If I went to watch it for a third time, I believe my computer would cry entreating for help, or at least shutdown itself out of fatigue!",5,1,3,25 August 2017
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," No Fun !
","When I say, it's dare to say, among (Harry Potter)'s fans that I had no fun watching its series after part 2, it's more or less an unforgivable SIN!But, honestly, these movies are so dark, dismal, full of talk more than action, and CGI more than drama. This one is no exception. It's another episode of the silly emptiness which cropped millions of Dollars, and still crops.So what we have here? On the level of the dramatic progress of the series, if there was any, it's where we get to know that (Harry)'s father was bullying (Snape) back when they were young, (Harry) is mentoring the school's students to fight the evil, and (Sirius)'s character gets killed. On the level of drama of this movie apart, it's the speech against fascism portrayed through the character of professor (Dolores Umbridge), the matter of (Harry) seeing what's going on (Voldemort)'s mind, and (Harry)'s first love. So much for the fans, and too little for me!The trial of (Harry) at the start didn't add anything to anything. The whole idea of the Order of the Phoenix itself, the movie's title, wasn't used well, rather looked unnecessary. The dialogue between the 3 leads was too weak; in fact, saying it so seriously made it even weaker! For no logical reason, (Dumbledore) this round seems nervous, and doesn't hear but himself. The way the twin rebel against professor (Umbridge) was visually good, but not that convincing. There was no relief, unless you think that (Hermoine)'s remark to Ron 'You eat too much' is a comedy! And then, the dark side, or sides. Mark Adams, of The Sunday Mirror, called the movie 'A dark and delicious delight.', well, I agree on being 'a dark' only Mr. Adams!I know, it's not another Disney soft adventure; it's violent, so serious, fantasy. But Disney's or not, I can't bear it. For me, none is fun here. As a visual feast, it left me hungry, not satisfied. As for an action, I deem it not one in the first place, and the present sequences aren't great or memorable. And as a fantasy, it wins with pure imagination, however thrown in only some moments. Frankly, I enjoyed the parts where the old worker was nailing up (Umbridge)'s rules, as if he was nailing in the students' freedom's coffin, AND THAT WAS IT!Near its end, I lost interest wholly, wanting to sleep as a better deed (actually I yawned a lot till that point!). In general, this movie is as the rest of the HP many sequels: so boring to follow, so dry to entertain.Finally, other than my admitting that this belongs to the section of 'It's not for me' movie, this series proves, in a way, that the kid of the 2000s prefers dark stories. Too dark for the kid in me though!",Null,2,3,30 April 2012
Annie Hall," A Great Comedy By (Woody Allen) About (Woody Allen) !
","When someone secludes himself into himself, and becomes incapable of change; then he loses his love. That's the smart meaning of this comedy. And what's even smarter is how that serious meaning was made through a comedy.(Woody Allen) structured the story on numerous situations, which he organized in the same order how they run in his lead's mind. That lead himself is considered now an icon in terms of expressing the hesitant cultured man, who's timorous when it comes to love, commitment, and stability. The final result is something deep yet funny; to the extent that it could be the funniest psychological movie ever made.I loved that collection of daily details which formulate the lead's character eloquently, take a list: How he, as self-conceited, feels importunate necessity to prove his point of view's rightness for some guy, who hears accidentally in a line of a theater; hence, it takes a brief dream appearance of (Marshall McLuhan) to assure the lead's superiority, and shut-up any disagreement. The lead's culture gets in the way between him and having sex with a beauty, while - in fact - it's his forever fear disguised as a discussion about who killed (JFK), where he doesn't suspect the CIA, but - really - his own sexual capacities! The lead doesn't see anyone further himself; so he deemed dully that the need for love, ambition, encouragement, and alteration form his girl's side--are nothing but bad symptoms caused by her period! He was too blind to grasp the truth of himself as the actual reason of why his love failed. And lastly, he can't change himself, only his love story's end, which he writes as a play; because what can't be fixed in reality can be fixed in art. This is, as a whole, a profound exploration done very amusingly too.So with uniquely structured script; that provided masterly drama and comedy, lively editing, and lovely acting, (Annie Hall) has the word 'classic' written all over it. Many next movies, some of them by (Allen) himself, wanted to imitate it. But they were mostly less good. Maybe because they were uncreatively subjective, stupidly vague, boringly soulless. Or maybe not as witty, intensive, or hearty as (Annie Hall).Though, the thing to bother a bit is that (Allen) with his strong consciousness and brilliant inventiveness became less attractive as time goes by, with the same problems in the same character; which produced several comedies by (Woody Allen) about (Woody Allen)'s cinematic persona. Hmmm, that's the act of someone who secludes himself into himself, and becomes incapable of change. As if (Allen) doesn't learn from his own lessons.. even they're that good!",8,2,4,4 April 2008
Taken," 2 Fast, 2 Furious !
","You know it. They kidnapped, raped, or killed (sometimes the three together) his daughter, his wife, his pet, whatever. What does matter though is that, within a maximum of 20 or 25 minutes of the movie's start, ALL HELL BREAKS LOOOOOOSE!The mix this time includes the thrilling search for the kidnapped girl by the vengeful father with the shoot 'um up solution. If Death Wish remade The Count of Monte Cristo as urban merciless father, Commando put the one-man-army to it. Here he has a little of everything added to a touch of James Bond (An ex-secret agent, disguises, Europe streets, some gadgets..). And the outcome of that is fine action thriller.The best about it is surely the succession of the story. The way that father gets back his daughter from scratch wins the whole movie. The worst about it is the editing and the violence.The editing gives no chance for anything to get out the comics case. I only hated it at the end's fight where it was like being in a fast train and nothing is clearly seen, just noisiness all the way then a suddenly successful hero!The matter of the lead as a killing machine bothered me. Not because we have a wonderful actor this time, since the movie is dead set on wonderful thrill and action scenes, not drama. But simply because 1) He's unbeatable, which means Boooring. 2) He even can't be hurt, as if he's wearing invisible body's armor! 3) He kills everybody in front of him, being Rambo in the City!I feel happy for (Liam Nieson). In his late fifties and he's making hit action movies, all in Hollywood (Try to name 10 stars who still work in action movies nowadays while being above 55?!).What I don't feel so happy about it; is being too fast and too furious. However I always ask myself, if the hero, in any action, killed numerous persons (35 as in here, or 236 as in Rambo 4 one year earlier), then how many persons the audience wants to kill to make the producers of that do so?! Apparently the feel of relief lately has become something increasingly harsh and bloody. So with (Taken), grossing six times its budget, you must comprehend it's not the movie, it's the world which we're living that's 2 Fast, 2 Furious!",6,0,0,16 July 2011
The Mummy Returns," When The Exaggeration was Scarier than The Mummy !
","The morning after (The Mummy) was released, its producers at (Universal) phoned its talented and diligent director (Stephen Sommers) asking him: 'We need another one!'. And the rest is history.. and foolishness as well!It's not that bad at all. On the contrary, it tries to be bigger than the first one, achieving dazzling image, hot pace, being like vivacious comic book. However, while the first movie was a lesson in how to make a pure cinematic adventure full of action, thrill, comedy and imagination to the extreme, this one is weaker and less cohesive. I think, this time, it exceeded the extreme; and that was a problem!Script wise, it was crowded. The long flashback in the movie's middle weakened the flow, there were too many storylines, and the dramatic logic of the whole thing was flimsy; for instances: Who's that modern girl with the soul of a 'Anck Su Namun'?, how 'Imhotep' did get his life back after being mortal in the first one?, how the scorpion king will destroy the world?!, moreover why did the god of evil betray him in the first place?!, well, it'll be so silly indeed to add also the historical corrections for the main story; but who cares? It's a crazy action fantasy after all; which became here a very brainless one too!The CGI was hasty and embarrassingly needy sometimes. I see that its aspiration was more than the movie's abilities, and this is obvious at the visual momentum of the climactic sequences.The outcome was a cross between (Indiana Jones) movies & (The Lost World - 1997), however heavy, vociferous, and a little poor. I know that I got a headache because of it. So its impressiveness fades away after the watching, and lessens as time goes by. Not like part one, (The Mummy - 1999), which is close to iconic 'B' movie and still that young and entertaining till now, unlike its idiotically exaggerated sequel that destroyed itself by its own exaggeration.",6,0,1,8 February 2008
Mission: Impossible," We All Know That It's about Nothing But 2 Memorable Sequences !
","'The problem of this movie is that (Brian De Palma) razed the very main theme which the whole series was based on; and I mean the idea of the team's spirit, or the real unity of those gifted genius agents who were all killed by him at the beginning of the film in cold blood to make their superior, the old dearly loved character, as the low killer and the actual traitor!Moreover, it took us a very long time of waiting to have a Mission Impossible movie. And when that finally happened, we found out that the popular show was transformed into the last thing you could ever expect; a paranoia about the intelligence's men after the end of the cold war!And you know what? Maybe (Tom Cruise) will love it, and consider it his ticket to the world of big loud action movies, that got sequels every summer like (Lethal Weapon) or (Die Hard)! So it'll not be (Mission Impossible) any more; it'll become (Mission for Tom Crouse), or (The Adventures of The Short American Brother of James Bond)!!'That was my unpublished comment about the movie, right after watching it for the very first time in 1996 (I found it lately in forgotten papers of mine). And it said it all for sure, especially when you read it in 2007, after two sequels already, and more destruction for the original lovable (MI) which was a landmark in the TV history.As for the movie, we all know that it's about nothing but 2 memorable sequences; a thrilling heist one, and another so Hollywood action one. Because aside from them, there was no understandable plot. Even with so deep concentration, there isn't much to catch on. It's a movie about spies, which looks attractive and respectable, but surely not that interesting, intelligible or funny. It is Bond, however taking itself so-over-the-top seriously, where it mustn't. Imagine double-crossed, too earnest, and avenger Bond, played by poor (Tom Cruise) under the name, ONLY the name, of Mission Impossible TV show.. Just Grrrr!Hence, that was Mission Impossible without The Mission Impossible usual. A smart thriller that didn't show some smart plot. A movie with unconvincing lead. And despite being partly watchable, this is naturally a shock for the TV show fans.Wanna explain everything? I'll do it in one line: Cruise is the producer of all the three MI movies to date. And simply the man wanted some space to make his own action blockbusters, NOT a movie with 5 stars about team of 5 agents. However, something in you must scream angrily that he just picked the wrong origin to mess with; where the main wrong happened to the show!ANYHOW. It's a *different formula* this time, which differs from big part of what the famous title tells, or used to tell. So if you want its artistic thriller: then this movie is for you. If you want its downright absurd action: it's part 2. And if you want the best of the previous 2 movies; then it's part 3 for you, which is their more perfect, less far from the original TV show.",5,0,1,11 August 2007
Rio," Some is Fun, most is Predictable !
","Before watching (Rio), someone told me that 'The Latino music of it is so refreshing'. Well, it was maybe another way to say that the soundtrack is the good thing about it!The main storyline seems so similar to Pixar's not too far hit (Finding Nemo - 2003); with parrot instead of fish, geeky owner instead of afraid father, and Rio instead of the sea. But of course on this scale (Finding Nimo) prevails with more unique characters and more dazzling image.The songs aren't touchy or beautiful enough; I hated the too dirty lyrics of the evil bird's song! And basically how come that everybody sings except the leads; whether the human or the flying ones, why it's Lionel Richie to undertake the job every time?! Furthermore, didn't you notice how almost every possible emotional climax, like the one over the trolley, isn't complete with always something to disappoint it?!The designing of the characters didn't interest me at all. For clear example look at the female parrot; it has nothing to be distinct or remembered by. The slimy bulldog was disgusting; but let's put that one in the corner of 'accepting the other'. The rest is less than important, I couldn't stand most of the human characters; look how the lab's fat guard, who went to dance, looks exactly like the evil man's fat henchman!Some characters appear to disappear, like the husband / father / guide. I know it's kind of road movies' basis, but the thing is that character wasn't written good or satisfying in the first place. I was provoked by the moment in which the electricity, of the whole city, goes out because one pole in one slum got broken?!While there are many stars behind the mike this time, Jesse Eisenberg and Leslie Mann are the only ones who made their job work. The climax didn't sound original; I have seen that plane situation which gets opened in the sky, as a climax, in previous other movies like The Living Daylights (1987) and Chain Reaction (1996).What keep it together are the fast pace, the smooth colors, the flashy lights, the lovely backgrounds, and the nice music. The parallel 2 love stories are well done, with the same slow-motion magical intro for the girl capturing the boy's attention shown twice; one for the birds and one for the humans. Few moments of graphic proved to be exceptional; like the sad, rather collapsed, body language of (Linda)'s character while her bird is being taken into the plane near the end. And the 2 dancing sequences, of the start and the end, are so good they deserve another movie!All in all, one look to this Twentieth Century Fox Animation's production shows how and why other, cleverer, studios, like Disney or Pixar, spend more time on things like script or songs.(Rio) is a celebration of freedom, colors and Latino music. Fun to watch, but not for many times, because - really - I have seen it before, many times, and better too!",Null,1,2,28 August 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," Dead Film about Death !
","This film caused me some confusion as being unidentified. OK, it's a comedy. A real good one about a husband who wants desperately to cheat on his wife in the most inauspicious night in his life! But I always thought that (Tom Cruise) can't do comedy. To tell you the truth, according to its making's circumstances, which ate up 2 years of its leads' ages, then it's a black comedy already! Hmmm, maybe it's a horror, for sure when I review my memory of watching it, I discover how it's a ruthless horror indeed, it even managed to give me nightmares later; and ironically I'm not kidding!Actually, it could be one of the most anti-western civilization films ever, condemning the killer materialism, and unspiritual thinking, which led the human to immerse into 'sex', and get lost through its deepest aberrant ways. (Stanley Kubrick) wanted to make a different satire against the wide eyes shut's belief, disgracing all of his community by the shame of being wildly blind, crazy about coitus with or without love, being bodies that kill each other or themselves for fun; as if humans became the worst animals. The film tried to be an ominous of this civilization's end. And that's great. Yet theoretically. Because Mr. perfectionist-in-a-very-sick-way (Stanley Kubrick)'s ultimate result out of that was something totally uninteresting, and highly disappointing. Humdrum, tasteless, and one of the blandest. The list would go endlessly.Originally, it's highly thoughtful, but obviously not as great as what it handles. At first, you'd feel how the story was sort of expressing as a simple and symbolic one that could epitomize its cosmos, lampoon it, and insinuate to its death. Though, it sounded eventually forced and spiritless. The long, very long, shots weren't for the sake of scrutiny, inasmuch as the sake of being sleepy or unbearable. The editing transformed the whole matter into one big slow tooth extraction. (Tom Cruise) is the best paradox when it comes to soil the American dream or looking misguided childish, but despite how he tried, he wasn't that important actor to represent any possible depths. Some of the image details looked primitive (the newspaper's title: 'How lucky that you're alive' or some things like that!). Everything ranges rather between ambiguous or naive. That dreamlike sense was done so dully. All the mind games that (Kubrick) loves to play, like deliberate image goofs, went to nothing, or maybe they were just goofs after all! Even the piano music, so the classic records, were very monotonous and blank, stealing the movie's spirit. It looked wholly lifeless. I don't think, at any rate, that making a film about dead life must be lifeless.. or deadly!I believe that there was a certain paranoia or megalomania in (Kubrick) which affected his vision badly, so I'm sure that a poor film like this seemed The Iconic Cinema from his point of view. And it shows. I recall what my friend likened the movie with when we first saw it: 'This is not a film, this is a documentary!'. I agree with that, as a live painful documentary about how to lose a good idea, torture your cast, and your audience, be absent for years, and waste more years on what's lower than what you already did. And you know what the worst of it is? It feels like a documentary!(Eyes Wide Shut) ended up having the sad irony of good premise, bad film. It's where the only actual good thing about it, else being creepy, is the moment of (Nicole Kidman) saying the 'F' word in the end so tenderly. Although it's a smart, very cynical, ending for such a film about a world that relishes its death, and sees sex as the cure of everything. Nevertheless, it can't save a film that relishes its death, and doesn't 'see' in the first place. Sorrowfully, (Kubrick) did it wide eyes shut himself!",Null,2,5,22 December 2008
Pulp Fiction," Everyone Has Their Own Nonsense !
","Save all the sophisticated Yada, Yada, Yada, and all the smart Blah, Blah, Blah. I watched it 3 times trying my best to like it, though it failed big time to leave any effect but disgust, silliness, and being provocatively absurd; and maybe that's Quentin Tarantino's original dream purely! It is the ultimate boring nonsense, and it's proud of itself too. OH MY GOD, how did Tarantino manage to persuade all of these stars to do it in the first place, I swear this is a mystery for me!Though, at certain piece in my mind, I have to 'respect' its script somehow, because its different structure, and revolutionary sense. It succeeded to be a cheap novel which has been published cheaply in not well-ordered pages. It left its clear mark on all the crime movies after, with some followers that range between ugly and uglier. And still it's the most artistic movie made by Tarantino yet. WAW, I can be objective to surprising extent!But, in the same time, this movie is as dull as Harvey Keitel's face, as meaningless as how Bruce Willis seemed, and as unfunny as Uma Thurman is. It's wholly non-enjoyable, highly sickening, and a special torture to watch. I ranked it in my list of the worst 10 movies I've have ever seen, which makes me the biggest misfit among all the mad lovers of it. It's the forever tragedy of being in love with the usual: (2001: A Space Odyssey), (The Godfather: Part II), (Chinatown), etc.. As if loving and appreciating them make you a well cultured movie buff, and a venerable thoughtful brain! But you know what? I don't love them at all, I love (Die Hard 1), (The Guns of Navarone), and (The Boy Who Could Fly), and for any one who dares to veto, then let's step outside!Huh? It won the Oscar, So what? Some people yearly gather, at the Oscars or else, to select the fine movie from THEIR point of view, and simply this one isn't fine from MY point of view. I may care about its novelty, but I won't give a hoot about its characters, atmosphere, or world. Any movie that has Christopher Walken narrating such a nauseating story about some watch in some war--is definitely not for me WHATEVER THE GREAT MEANING BEHIND THAT ANYWAY! Even the plot, yes it's variant and motivating, but not smart. Its final result was something so ridiculous and cold. It's anti-formulaic yet produced a sleepy doped up crime movie. It's not the case of style prevailed narration, it's a case of style killed the narration (if there was any!), to show off what looked eventually like oddity for oddity.After so many movies by Tarantino, it's official: the man is a master of nonsense, who's so educated when it comes to the internationally cinematic nonsense history, and so creative in producing lots and lots of highly manufactured nonsense. However, sometimes he makes movies about uninteresting people in uninteresting ways, recycling the old nonsense into new forms, making it perfectly interesting for anyone but me! I don't hate Tarantino, but I hate Tarantino's (Pulp Fiction). Sorry, not my kind of nonsense.",3,3,9,21 December 2008
The Da Vinci Code," More Dark Points Than Any Bright Ones !
","The dark points:_So Jesus Christ had married?! There is a progeny of him?! And the Vatican is running a special mafia?! I think the last allegation is an enough reason for why Hollywood loved the novel after being bestseller!_The French officer is positive that the American scientist is the killer while the last was simply giving a long lecture during the time of murder!_Oh God. That old man, the first murdered, had a lot of time to write all over the Louvre! (It deserves to be mocked at in Epic Movie!)._Why Mr. so energetic corpse, aka the first murdered, demanded a scientist he doesn't love?! (a point the movie didn't make clear at all!)._Sure the granddaughter picked the wrong day to reconnect with her grandfather!_Ok, that granddaughter can drive cars better than the American leads of the action movies!_How the genius police officer connected between the 2 fugitives and the other murders that happened all the night?_(Ian Mckellan)'s character could run pretty well for a crippled man!_The archbishop, who has a hired killer for him!, had a money to do what exactly? And what a joke when his killer kills him accidentally indeed!_Now to even bigger joke. I mean what kind of mentality that designs this maze of letters, numbers, places and texts' enigmas? I know. The mentality of one desperate thriller's writer (at least National Treasure was more convincing!). With more than enough accumulation, and an absence of what goal this search seeks, the movie gave a one of a kind bore that turned the matter into idiot sophisticated thriller._Then, and how I hate this point, how the 2 leads got forgiven, just like that, at the end?!!!!!!!!! (The police officer knows the writer I bet!)._The way all the facts are discovered; that was too easy. For really dark example, the way the lead knows that his partner is the Christ's granddaughter. Or the way the museum's clerk knows that she is, and tells the rest of the 'Zion' people??!!!_The last dialogue between the lead and his partner is so naive. Who can respect what they were saying? 'Maybe humanity is divinity'?!! This is a talk of a teenager, not a scientist!_The always distinct (Hans Zimmer) wasn't distinct in here._...And finally, the junky that the heroine gave money will buy more drugs and die overdosed.The bright points:_(Audrey Tautou)'s cute face and clothes._Being a fast-paced movie, which takes place in nearly 24 hours._The CGI was dazzling.My Verdict:This is a Hollywood thriller which has issues that I mostly didn't buy, and elements that I mostly didn't love.",3,1,3,28 October 2010
Titanic," The Viewer's Heart is a Deep Ocean of Secrets !
","So this is maybe the billion review about (Titanic). The first thing I must say is about me being so irritated of this movie. Surely, when you hear about one movie as the greatest, know that it hit all the records, then get to see it to discover that it's another movie, and how there were many better movies that didn't get 10 % of the popularity that that one had, then you must be as irritated as me!Most of the characters are fine, but not in a capable drama. Let's face it; (James Cameron) wanted mainly a big production disaster movie, not a romantic epic. The start is too long and boring. 'The women's heart is a deep ocean of secrets' aside from being the movie's only interesting line, it's not that interesting in the first place. Sometimes the man's heart is a deep ocean of secrets also!I hated the nude scene. It's not about me despising nudity in the first place; it's about it as something that ruined the romantic sense of the movie thereafter. Talk about ruining; then it's more than clear that the chemistry between the 2 leads was missing. A lot of viewers, I'm one of them, saw that (Kate Winslet) had more presence than (Leonardo DiCaprio), and looked a bit older than him as well!I can't stand the fact that (Rose) is the one who killed (Jack), when she left him in the icy water. Why she didn't give him a part of raft, or got to be on it for some, then (Jack) for some?? SO SELFISH! And yes, the tragedy of 'My Hard Will Go on'! For anyone who didn't live 1997, that was a complete nightmare pals. This song was everywhere, if you didn't find it in radio, then it would meet you in TV, and when you got red of it, then it would hunt you down successfully from the cars' audio system!I didn't satisfy with the Oscars too. The hyped persona of the movie mirrored itself highly in the Academy Award's night. But it didn't win the script's award. In fact, it couldn't. If something about it is really great, else the global mania, so it is its CGI. (Cameron) dreamed and fulfilled perfectly in that area. Anyhow, this is a very good movie after all. An action fare, a powerful disaster flick, with some romantic moments. It got an old love story yet with a lovely charisma as a whole. But, it only doesn't work for me. Sometimes, it's all the time, you have another taste.Though, I liked some nice bits; like how (Jack) is the youthful lively modernism of this stiff world. Or the part of the musicians playing the music while everything is dying, simply because the artist, the real one, have no message in life but to play their music and to the end of life. And I liked the final scene / Rose's dream where her love goes on and on. But, to tell you the truth, it was one of the excellent endings which you wish another, more deep and satisfying, movie for it!If you looked to the whole history of cinema, you'll find many movies, like (Titanic) or better, whether they were meant to be big hits or just truthful works; they didn't make it to be the most successful ever. It's just a certain moment when the audience needs all what one movie has. However, the audience's necessities remain vague, unpredictable and change from time to time. And whatever the intelligence of any moviemaker is, no one will ever know what exactly these necessities may be in one moment on big scale. Or what the movie to fulfill them can be. Otherwise all the movies out there will be another (Titanic)!(Titanic - 1997) is the absolute chance to explore the mood of the viewer of the twentieth century's end. It presented a love story in the middle of a fallen world / the ship itself. As if the huge, rich and proud civilization is in its way to a near inevitable collapse by hitting an iceberg; where the coldness of all the humans, aka: the icebergs, will kill them eventually, and the only survivor will be love. So the necklace, that somehow can survive too, while representing all the material values; will equal nothing in the end. Notice that the end isn't happy; that's uncommon, as this true lover got no place in our fatally hectic world.It wasn't a coincidence that (Titanic) made it big. It is a clever movie that came in the right moment. But in another moment, that clever movie could've made it to be a mighty flop. It is the viewer's heart which's a deep ocean of secrets. And some movies come in some time, precisely 'in time', to unlock it.",6,1,2,27 August 2009
Thor," Sleepwriting !
","I know that you know sleepwalking. Now welcome to a new illness that you can learn about, rather live, through today's Hollywood blockbusters. Eagar to understand? Well, (Thor) gives you a good chance!There are many fine elements in this movie. The Australian Chris Hemsworth is a powerful newcomer that Hollywood must feel lucky to have. He has the looks and the talent. I hope seeing him in more dramatic roles. Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins are always a delight, even if have nothing serious to do (or - as in here - have nothing at all!). The interiors of that spatial Asgard were cleverly designed; I loved the metal floors and walls, instead of Norse usual buildings. Some sequences were very well-made such as Thor's try to retrieve his hammer, Mjolnir, from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. The comic sense is there with truly lovable lines. The music moved me. And I was astonished when I knew that the closing credits sequence was based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope and took 18 months to create!Director Kenneth Branagh, a William Shakespeare's old lover, conceptualized this movie as a Norse/comic-book twist on 2 Shakespeare's plays. Firstly (Henry V), which was about a young king who underwent trials, fighting a war, courting a girl from another land, trying to live up to the example set by his father the king. Secondly (King Lear), where one prince, due to being jealous of his brother, tricks his father for exiling that brother. These Shakespearean echoes distinguished the movie, representing a serious mark that many superhero movies lack.Nevertheless, that script wasn't all perfect. While it had established logic and Shakespearean skies in the first half, it went dumb, or crazy, in the second half: Thor is an arrogant hot-headed and uproarious, then he's humble wise and calm? How that happened?! Loki invites the kingdom's enemy to kill his father, just to rescue the latter on the nick of time, so he may be close to his father. OK. The thing that isn't remotely OK is that why in God's name Loki goes to destroy the entire human race in no time after that?? Thor is sorry for destroying the bridge that was connecting his world with his love's world, while Loki was traveling from that world to this world, so easily, without needing that bridge! And I have to admit, as someone in IMDb referred before: Thor's 4 friends turned out to be nothing but idiots!It needed 6 people to be written?? I know truly big epics that didn't need half of that number. And according to their work, it's clear that they were sober at first, then went sleepwriting all along! Actually most of the American blockbusters lately don't have good scriptwriting, or good scriptwriting that lasts till the end. The script, in general, became the hardest, the rarest, or - in best cases - the least taken care of element. So why is that? Do the movie makers think that putting nice looking stars, dazzling images, 3D, speedy pace, and roaring sound effects will make the viewers forget about the story? Is it a Hollywood writers' crisis, where good writing became scarce? Is it hastiness? Or is it frankly a new faith that 'writing' isn't that important in the first place?!Over and above, the CGI felt sometimes cheap. The look of Asgard's exteriors didn't impress me at all. The monstrous 'Destroyer' wasn't scary, maybe funny. The Bifröst bridge came out as something that belongs to a 1970s Disco. And you read that the movie's budget was 150 million dollars? Where did it go?!! Speaking about funny, the Asgard crown was so laughable, especially in the serious parts. Branagh enjoyed the oblique cadres for more than enough. He repeated it with no dramatic intention whatsoever, most probably to seem cool or hip. I suppose he saw it a lot in contemporary music videos, thus decided to shoot many many moments with oblique camera to attract the young viewers. Though I know one thing; while being a young viewer myself, that caused me an oblique head for some time after the viewing!(Thor) is a mix of fantasy, sci-fi, action, with a bit of comedy and romance. It has unusual atmosphere, potential drama, and good acting that you can't find in late superhero movies like Superman, Spider-man, or Iron Man. For the first half, it runs beautifully, hitting the mark, being entertaining to the max. However, in the second half, things weren't as solid. Again, and again, and again, the script is the treasure box, and the scriptwriter is the one who has the key of it, or has not. Compare the movie's 2 halves, rather the old Hollywood to the recent one, to know that sleepwriting became a new illness, or - in fact - a new vogue in today's Hollywood!",6,0,6,3 September 2012
The Fountain," The right way to be immortal !
","Sometimes a movie is so good to the extent of not knowing how to write about it. (The Fountain) has many reasons to be one. But I think 2 pieces of info can provide an intro to speak easily about its beauty. The first is that its writer / director (Darren Aronofsky) loves classic movies. And the second is that he, as a teenager, spent time doing graffiti art.Now this man could evoke a meaning about the importance of faith and accepting death as a step in life. It's where the awful clinging to life mirrors a wrong understanding of love. So lastly, thinking that he overcame death and reached immortality, the lead invented none other than a way to distance himself from his love for longer time. Hence he should surrender to death as fate that will re-gather him with his love; namely believe in the divine law. Clearly meanings like these have been lost in the Hollywood movies lately. You must remind the old classic ones, especially when it comes to faith. Then, the artistic vision of (Aronofsky). Oh my god. He could make a very sophisticated image yet in a lovely way. Aside from being good looking movie, it managed to be a book of signs, dealing with life, death, and love by symbolic forms, as if it makes its own artistic dictionary.The chromatic personality of the film was precise. The brown and black for most of the events, as long as the desire for immortality is on, a dark desire for that matter. The golden yellow for moments like the drug's discovery; since it mirrors – in the film's conscience – a sick thirst to delaying death but ending it. The too glaring white for the true love or going to death. See also how the scenes of the husband and his dying wife are natural yet in a black frame or depth. Then, the green triumphs eventually, when the Spanish knight sees the fountain for the first time, however to assure that the immortality in life may be given for things, not humans (the nightmarish moment of the plants grow out of his body, burying him as the answer to his eternity).While not having a huge budget in his hands, (Aronofsky), in a way that dazzled me personally, didn't use any CGI. Instead, he chose to do the special effects by using micro-photography of chemical reactions on tiny petri dishes. A very old way, but it worked, being no less than any more costly way. And most of all it didn't look fake, be hyped up, or feel made for itself. The performance is sensitive and truthful. A scene like the one of the bath fascinated me indeed. Makes you somehow hate the action and comic movies that worn out stars, like (Hugh Jackman), (Rachel Weisz) or else, to a degree where true characters and feelings become rare to find, and the actor, inside of such stars, fades out !The problem remains in the script's third act. It's confused. For instance, how come that the lead is the last man on earth ? He, one way or another, found a drug to lesson the ageing, however why there isn't any other human alive with him ? How nobody drank it but him since it must have been gone public ? Another, more dangerous, matter which is the 3 stories' meeting point. The line between the past's Spanish knight and the present's doctor was a bit blurred. Some would be pushed to think that they're one, not a fictional character / the knight in a book which the factual lead / the doctor completes. Anyway, something was rushed about that third.By watching many of (Darren Aronofsky)'s works, I believe he has an obsession. Nearly all of his films are bout the human lust. The addiction, of drug and fame, in (Requiem for a Dream – 2000). The desire of being immortal in (The Fountain – 2006). And the complete opposite, yet the same extreme, in (Black Swan – 2010) where the lust is terribly suppressed. For him lust, without balance or real love, is a fertile source of horror. And the original maker of hell is the human self. (Aronofsky) seems not interested in Hollywood blockbusters, so he directed only 5 movies in 12 years. While being not so smart choice from his side, which may change soon, he had a great opportunity to be interesting, different and unique with a few movies, I see that (The Fountain) is their most perfect yet, whether intellectually or visually.An enjoyable thought-provoking film, with maybe the greatest message of them all. How many times you could say that about a film ? In a word : immortality can be won by work like this.",8,2,4,11 July 2011
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A Remake of a TV Show, A Prequel of a Video Game; It's Nearly The Typical Hollywood Movie Of The 2000s !
","'I love it very much!'I'm talking about the main idea, which is so inspiring, like (The War of the Roses) meets (True Lies). And not only as a new action comedy, but also as a developed version of the screwball or the misunderstanding comedies of the 1960s, with unique main motif to say about how lying on the one you love can kill the relationship, or how when you're not truthful then you're a killer for yourself and your love too. That's clever, especially when you have the capacity to express it brightly, and expensively, through big and loud American blockbuster, HOWEVER, not all the dreams can be fulfilled!'What's wrong?!'Truly it's 'what are wrong?!' because it's a long list: there is absolutely no solid logic that can connect all of that together. Not to mention, making it as pure action which destroyed the beauty of the idea to turn it into another idiot video clip. Although (Brad Pitt) and (Angelina Jolie) are bankable movie stars with a controversial love story (out of the movie yet good for it!), but both of them in here are so inanimate. They seemed sometimes like 2 characters in one video game, with dead performance and rarely memorable moments. There is no evidence of wicked moment, or creative touch. They were unfunny in a very funny mood, events and situations. And surely the stupidest third act ever, where we have the pleasure of watching such a silly, tepid, boring, long gun shooting, without seeing the tough enemies like one of those games, but without even the heat, the thrill, or the dexterity of it. To tell you the strange truth, at the last 20 minutes, I fell asleep right in the theater, despite how sharp and high the sound effects were! And now I read about how the production company cut some of the original climax where the couple get revenge perfectly on their bosses; which means that what we were watching was a sloppy cartoon without even a fair ending!'The bitterness of the sweetness!'We all love the commercial movies, there isn't anyone who hates some entertaining time in their life, to feel loose, to live the dream; even if it's naive or foolish dream. But in the American cinema now, we have those too many, too costly, and too dumb remakes, with a die hard desire to be profitable by using: hasty unoriginal idea, low degree scripts, hurly-burly CGI, dead performances, the mechanical atmosphere of the video games, the hugest explosions all the time, and the usual triteness as assured scarcely good sequels & prequels & spin offs & video games, etc. (Mr. & Mrs. Smith) is a clear example of that condition, being semi-ideal for that kind of movies in the 2000s, with all of their bad ingredients, added to amputated ending which competently makes the whole movie deficient just like our feeling about it. So what was that anyway?! Well, it's another amusing merchandise from the dream factor, but wasn't that clever as its likes, or as its latent abilities.'And as a wise man said once..'Wait for better sequel!",5,1,3,30 December 2007
The Departed," Epic !.. What Epic ?!
","Sometimes, the Oscars, and the film critics, agree on one opinion. Sometimes, I disagree with that. This time is one of their biggest!(The Departed) is a crime thriller. And coming from such an honored director, such as Martin Scorsese, guarantees thrill and possible substance. However, it wasn't that excellent, and had many problems.The time-line wasn't taken care of; suddenly, within 2 ordinary scenes, not even a respectable montage, a year passed by! The doctor is falling in love with 2 police officers, where their second is undercover, and no one knows about it; whether their first, or the mob?!! While Jack Nicholson's character, Costello, is a mafia lord, who makes international arms deals, he's still running around the streets, collecting protection money; so is he a mafia lord or a small time goon?!! Mark Wahlberg's character can't be the relief, can't be convincing, and - to tell you the truth - can't be bearable either! The F word is given, every second, in a free and overabundant manner; they used it for a total of 237 times. Unlike Scorsese' other mafia movies, increasing the cursing or swearing wasn't made for the sake of enhancing a realistic atmosphere inasmuch as compensating the drama's weakness, which didn't happen. On the contrary, it added fakeness, bore and nervousness! And how in God's name a dangerous police mission, like sending a man undercover through the world of organized crime, is known by just 2 persons?!?!?!!?!Who told Leonardo DiCaprio that the movie was a comedy? Because he acted exactly as if he was in one. By the way he looked and reacted, he was a scared mouse all along, so near of crying out loud: 'I'M A POLICEMAN, KILL ME AND PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY!!'. Matt Damon is not charismatic enough, talented enough, and hence veracious or right. I didn't hate his character, rather I hated him being unable to make me hate his character! His flat face and cold reactions don't tell that he came from the bottom. Vera Farmiga is mediocre at times, and so bad at others. There is no love in her eyes, maybe tension and horror. There is not one atom of chemistry between her and her 2 co-stars. And there is no doubt that she seemed older than them! Martin Sheen was icy as usual, but this time I can blame the script as well; obviously, he had no character.However, no one was more wrong than Jack Nicholson as Costello, to be the main course in this nonsense feast. Really what's worse than not understanding, feeling, or being persuaded by a character in a movie?! That Nicholson's Costello wasn't catchy, by any mean. And wasn't Irish either, by any mean! To add more and more fuel, Scorsese thought that talking dirty and loud, with some eccentric moves, make a unique evil gangster, but no such luck. So all the performance that I watched ranged between Jack Nicholson's Joker of Batman, and Jack Nicholson himself acting vainly. Enough to recall his scene with DiCaprio, while he was suspecting the latter; which was a complete drollery instead of a master scene!Speaking about farce leads directly to the movie's own substance. It's bogus. When Ray Winstone's character, who's - by the way - an underdeveloped character, says in bitter wisdom: 'A nation of rats..', you have to laugh sadly. 'Laugh' since this is the script's way to insert policy, or social commentary in this already unthrilling thriller. And 'sadly' because this adolescence comes from someone who used to be subtle like Scorsese. And it's the same adolescence which you find in the last scene with the rat. Ok, in regard to this, The Simpsons' Ralph Wiggum couldn't say it better: 'It symbolizes obviousness!!'. As a whole, the way this movie was made, doesn't turn it into a tragedy about the distrust in post-9/11 America, however maybe a farce about the same subject, especially with the end's farcical massacre!In his worst movies, Scorsese is interesting. However, here, it is so bad I think. His directing didn't win any artistic top; and it's a rare time when he makes something that doesn't impress or affect. As many of his movies, it's fast-paced, but his sedate touch was missed. Originally, the script lacks the power of cogency, as if it has no time for anything, and gives us the news flashes only. So with frantic editing, the movie felt like a speedy trailer, becoming utterly delirious. Therefore, any intended serious theme or satire came to nothing, and all what remained was mediocre crime thriller of which you don't enjoy much, and regretfully say after finishing: 'That could have been better.'All in all, in (The Departed) Martin Scorsese pulled off making uninteresting package of nervousness and adolescence, which has no relation whatsoever to his previous, and true, mafia epics like (Goodfellas) and (Casino). Although I may find explanations for choosing it as The Best Motion Picture of 2006 (America's bigwig critics are idiot, 2006's movies are horrible..), but I really don't know how the Academy gave Scorsese his first Oscar as a director for his so-called epic!",2,0,1,29 October 2013
Psycho," Clinging to The Past !
","I think that's an important horror piece. Bold, and nasty. But being just the well-done even original horror, doesn't make it outlive all the other movies of the genre as sure it did. What I loved about Psycho, regarding that I don't 'love' the Horror genre in the first place!, else being a brilliant case of Jekyll and Hyde as son and mother, or being that awesomely suspenseful and highly creepy, is that it has unique interpretation, and talented inner meaning of its own that will give it the immortality it deserves. In short, this genre movie.. Got brains!Norman Bates is nothing but a rare perfect type of a person who lives the past, and can't let it go. He is a clear proof that the strong clinging to the past, with losing the contact with the present, makes you a monster indeed. Look at him, lost it after the murder of his mother, the time stopped in that sick point, and also him. So when he couldn't utterly face the truth, the reality, he had to continue living yesterday endlessly and dopily, which led him to be the freak he was. He managed to kill his days by killing his best dreams / the nice girls, because he was a slave of his fear to face the world with his desires, transforming into the most ravenous, as well as the most alive, stuffed animal in the house.Norman buried his mother so himself into this motel where only his demons were being comfortable. This old palace illustrated perpetually the dark bygone, or the importunate sins, when we don't have the ability to break it away to become our chosen big tomb, and our dreams' slaughterhouse. Strange that nobody ever helped Norman, but since when anybody ever thinks of a troubled person like him in a greedy world that runs after the money, and the money only. Actually, it could be the reason why Norman Bates pulled off murdering whoever came to the motel, as he was stronger than them all, since he doesn't want the money.I liked the idea of suppressed kid in Anthony Perkins's performance as Norman, and how that could make him a serial killer in a way. The dialogue was plain and deep if you catch on the film's main motif, and interesting also with its sarcastic indications at the second watching: 'Mother didn't feel like herself tonight!'. And (Bernard Herrmann) is the best when it comes to create great horror music; I read once about making his music for black and white films into black and white feel too, by his own special orchestration. This man got both the eloquent style and the commercial captivity superbly. I'm obsessed with the opening credits' hot score, it said it all, and it can infiltrate into your deepest nastiness, or deal with what's under your skin of the most awful thoughts ever.I adore the brief, yet marvelously clever, zoom-in on Norman's face after he drowned the car, aside from being darkly expressing and distinctive at the 1950s' end, it's a slight touch confirms how Hitch was madly in love with the art of cinema. Though, still the most terrifying moment was when we have the chance finally to meet Mrs. Bates' face, but as for now, it's definitely the moment after, when Norman as Mrs. Bates smiles at the camera's eye refusing to harm a fly, and in one split second, we saw the ghost of the real mother's empty skull while the mix of the lifted car / the film's last shot; I believe Hitchcock made it confident that someone would see it as well as relish it in the assured next watching. As you see, one watching isn't enough.For negative points; unlike millions, I hated the bathtub's crime scene; yes, it was new, frightful, and Hitch enjoyed handling it cinematically, but it took sex and violence to extremes on screen, representing a new age of exploiting these factors in a shocking manner. A manner that would pave the way for more shocking, less human horror movies. I know that it's art, and the artist is free, and their creations have to develop, and push the boundaries, but maybe I don't like this kind of development, or encourage pushing these very boundaries.Btw, he lost reason behind the rest of Psycho's franchise as being lower is easy, they were only the exploitation, as cheap horror movies, with nothing under the surface to present, let alone the matter of breakable surface already, with less artistic everything, as if the producers took the worst of Norman Bates and Marion Crane themselves; killing madly yet to earn some big bucks!Psycho is some climax for Hitchcock, in terms of ability and popularity. It's a fine genre movie with possible meaning, which means very fine in my book apart. And the best about it was that it achieved being the most *film* among all the genre's movies.",8,0,2,21 December 2008
Hercules," Couldn't Be, or Look, That Fresh !
","I don't think that 1997 was a very good year in terms of movies. Terrible comedies (Bean, Fathers' Day, Mousehunt..), terrible action (Batman & Robin, The Fifth Element, The Postman). At the time, Disney was drowned in remakes of old movies or TV shows (Flubber, Mr. Magoo, George of the Jungle..). And according to most of them; they weren't less terrible. So, why not resorting to the Greek legends to remake something?! Which generates, forever and ever, the critical question: It isn't What to remake; it's How?!Transforming the storytellers into female black blues singers was the smartest idea here. They became more lively and modern. The gods' mentor (Philoctetes) is presented like a Kong-Fu master. Few details were mixed with contemporary matters; like the publicity stuff and the fame craze. However, you won't find more interesting ideas that could have recreated (Hercules) into something that fresh and catchy.Some points just drew my attention. Points related to the origin of all the legends and fairy tales. I think whether they all come from one basis, or that the human imagination is limited in certain molds that are consequently limited by the human experience; so whatever the differences are, it's one human after all. For instance, the ones who kidnapped the lead as a baby didn't kill him as they were ordered, instead, they left him in the woods; it's the European tale, collected by the brothers Grimm, (Snow white). The lead is lost from his parents, found by a family which doesn't have kids; it's the story of the profit (Moses) all over again. Then the lead discovers later that he isn't the guy who was raised as; it's similar to an event in the Arabic folk epic (El Seera El Hillalyia) in which the lead (Abo Zead) discovers that he isn't (Barakat); the guy who was raised as. (Hercules)'s power has been stripped from him by a seduction of one girl; (Samson) and (Delilah)'s story. It's known that every hero has his point of weakness; from (Achilles)' tendon to (Superman)'s feebleness towards Kryptonite. The name of the evil god (Hades) means - by its exact pronunciation - 'accident' in Arabic. And the 3 augurs reminded me of the 3 witches in Shakespeare's (Macbeth), or it's the other way around!Sure many serious theories had been written about the resemblance's points, or the unified sources. Yet what I wanted to say - in a way - is that this movie couldn't give me the feel of original. I was, during most of the time, in the 'I saw all of that before' zone. Add to that, many flaws in that script like lousy evil minions that look pale; being repeated from endless other movies, and so close to Rasputin's minion in (Anastasia); another cartoon movie from the same year, the totally unconvincing event of fettering all the Olympus's gods as if it's a bank robbery, or a breaking into some unguarded rich people's party, forgetting that they all have superpowers, rather the superpowers!, and finally a climax that manipulates foolishly the main character's fact; since we know pretty well that (Hercules) will win no matter what, based on his immortal power.The movie has not many good songs, comic enough - or at all - dialogue, or thrilling action sequences. I didn't like how (Philoctetes) was played with a touch of vulgarity. Consequently, it couldn't score high as a comedy, musical or action. And overall I don't remember one visually dazzling scene; not much of a direction too I must say.The end's song by (Ricky Martin) - who was having his moment back then - was inspiring. The design of (Hades)'s form fascinated me, with always fiery head, and ultra-nervous movement. But indubitably (James Woods) was the one who owned the scenery, by his so vividly loose, sometimes explosive, vocal performance as (Hades). As I read, his inventive dealing with the written material, based on his speedy way of speaking, made the writers re-modify the character to something else what they had in mind. Here's the spirit of creativity that this movie somewhat missed.It's a Disney's fun. Not shabby, and not great either. You can easily sense that it wasn't intended to be a big production. It seems to be coming from Disney Classic Cartoon: the B-movies branch. And it did manage to be a B-movie among Disney's A-list classics. I believe with more creative points, the story, any story, can be fresh, or at the largely familiar least, look fresh. The thing is this one lost being fresh as a script, direction, and hence as a movie.",Null,1,4,6 May 2011
Man on Fire," Wonderful, Sometimes Great, Nonsense !
","The story is like (Beauty and The Beast) meets (The Count of Monte Cristo) with a third act that carries a twist which could stand for a different concept about revenge. Although the rage and insistence that the revenge creates put this man on fire, even burned him, but it managed eventually to secure a fire escape for this beast (Creasy / Cristo), and, surprisingly this time, his Beauty as well, to represent a reprisal, or a revival, more than just another - so customary - retortion. And by that, it discovers a new catchy talent in the revenge's value where it can bring who or what we avenge for back to life.Tony Scott did it fine. Maybe too fine as he never did before. It's surely one climax for him as a director. His video clip style reaches a new sky this time. The thing is that his crazy technique clicked. And unlike movies like (Domino - 2005), it was so perfect to tell this story in specific, pulling off expressing it whether sensitively or violently. He could put simple yet genius touches here and there, taking his style, rather This style, to the next level. For instance, seeing the dead girl as a miserable ghost to comment on how she was a victim of everybody's greed and treachery, recalling some memories while some events related only by the lead's inner pain, seeing the lead bleeding in the swimming pool / dying out of sadness, or putting a shot from the end in the beginning; where Washington, in a second, is about to die in a car while the scene of entering the city in another car; as the forewords indicate the aftermaths. All of these moments consolidated the special character of the movie, invested the video clip for embodying stream of consciousness, and exalted this genre commercial movie to be something to explore and enjoy like a good book.The soundtrack wasn't less interesting. There are some effective music tracks to complete this impassioned ocean of images. From classic music and Operas (Chopin, Debussy's Clair de Lune, or Nessun Dorma from 'Turandot') that touch the lead's noble and sublime side through his relationship with the child, even during his revenge. To Latino tracks that mirror the atmosphere. Ending with loud stuff to embody the lead's crazy beastly condition while his crusade of a rage. And to top it all, Carlos Varela's, with no music, version of 'Una Palabra' while handing over the kid which I bet it won the viewers' hearts. Then Harry Gregson-Williams & Lisa Gerrard's 'Creasy Dies' as the highest end this movie could get. By the way, after one year, the Indian remake (Ek Ajnabee) would make something I thought the original missed; putting an especially written-for-the-movie song to distinguish the man and the kid's relationship.However, while being wonderful, sometimes great, it's still nothing but nonsense. The awful plot holes, the many unanswered questions, and the big unreal action scenes depreciate the movie considerably. And as thoughtless mistakes, it was an insult to a movie that speaks visually to your thinking. For instance, the movie said nothing about how the dad was involved in the kidnapping. It was the insurance money, but after 2 viewings I knew it from a friend's guesswork! His suicide looked absurd. Keeping the girl alive makes no sense at all, 'I'm a businessman' isn't an enough justification, and since the kidnapper is that businessman, why he didn't negotiate earlier?! How to execute so easily a known governmental official naked with a big bomb under a capital's bridge among many crowded streets, and in the daylight, let alone GETTING AWAY WITH IT?? That's too-unbelievable-it's-dumb! And why they didn't kill the lead right after handing over the child?? Well, the answer for all of that and more is one: it is nonsense. Namely another mindless and unrealistic revenge movie. Entertaining, yes, but not as high as what its expressive language reached sometimes.As always, I hated the violence, the foul language, and Dakota Fanning! She's supposed to be a cute child, but what I saw was a thirty-something Julia Roberts! She's supposed to be spontaneously infantile, but Fanning is always acting as a woman, annoying woman! And finally we're supposed to love her, be in mourning for her, though I was so unhappy that she was alive at last. Look at her talking to Washington in their last scene; this is absolutely NO 8-year-old child!Mexico City looked like a very evil, poor, and rotten place. Scott drew it with live colors and dirt. It was just streets of corrupted policemen, politicians, even rich people, and shanty town that swarms with drugs, weapons and dirty money. In a word: a hell of crime. So he had to write at the end 'Thanks to it, it is a special place'. It reminded me with (Mr. Magoo - 1997) when they apologized for the blind people after its end. This 'blind' vision is natural part of any nonsense. Where everything is used for the bigger purpose, which's here making the lead find his purgation with the lowest persons, by the lowest ways, in the lowest places. Despite how low that may sound for some!Still the best about this movie is the way its story was told. (Man on Fire) is a memorably proficient sonic and visual experience. It's another revenge story, but in not another rampant video clip for Tony Scott. Here what Oliver Stone does with serious issues had been done with droll stuff to uplift it. Maybe, just maybe, Michael Bay would be watching and learn himself a lesson!",8,0,1,26 January 2010
The Last King of Scotland," Watchable movie about a guy who falls for the wives of others !
","..more than one about the former Ugandan president (Idi Amin)!This script transformed the whole thing into a melodrama mixed with some thrill at the end, not a movie about a nation or a dictator.I believe the scriptwriter sunk in the character of the imaginary doctor, and his passion over the married women. This wasn't a right choice itself, because aside from taking a big part of (Idi Amin)'s transgressions and crimes, it took a lot from the lead's purity. That unsettled the character to face what he really deserves, and to be one of the last persons to judge the title's character. Actually when the husband gets revenge on the one who cheats his trust, and sleeps with his own wife, that, surely, gets the audience's sympathy, yet with the husband! Plus I didn't feel that the love affair between the doctor and the president's wife was a romance between 2 birds imprisoned in golden cages. For him, it was kind of emotional, too unbelievably risky, reaction towards taking away his freedom (or an affair with new married woman!). And for her?? The movie didn't give us convincing excuse to cheat on her husband else he's not that handsome young man!There are many goofy points all along: the British diplomat speaks his mind freely in front of anyone white! (Amin) has no intelligence agency, knowing the place of his suspected minister only from his doctor who saw the man accidentally?! I didn't get why (Amin) doesn't permit his ill son, who has epilepsy, to get a remedy?? And how oh how this scary dictator knew about the affair between his wife and his doctor, and did nothing about it??? Moreover, Dr. (Garrigan) ran over an innocent victim at the assassination scene while he has no regret about that after? We knew nothing about (Gillian Anderson)'s husband who we don't see at the end while her escape?! And the movie portrays the (Entebbe) situation as the climax of (Amin)'s crimes, while it didn't give us any enlightenment about its details in the same time!Who's (Idi Amin) in this movie? Look at the first meeting between the 2 main characters. The president didn't get mad over someone who grabbed his gun, and used it in front of him without his permission?!! He was happy that the doctor spoke his mind frankly (where was that?!), or how he thought totally afterwards that that doctor 'saved his life'? We didn't even know what happened originally between the president and the cow? Then in another, more intimate, meeting between the 2 men, after curing the president's stomach, we think that finally we'll get the chance to hear something that may clear (Amin)'s depths, but we don't! And all what we had about even the man's awful deeds was a swift TV report, a hasty expulsion decision, then a couple of phrases here and there. Hence, it's not who's (Amin) in this movie?, it's rather where's (Amin) in this movie?The third act was provocatively weird. It turns suddenly into cheap thriller, where the defeated lover wants to revenge on the husband who revenged on his unfaithful ones (is it a remake of Tony Scott's Revenge?!). So we have a suspense around will the president take the poison or not?, will his security manager take it instead of him or not?, will the boy get away with it, escape, going to be caught or not? And when the movie ends with his escape followed by the end of (Amin)'s regime; it's the top of idiocy as if this doctor was the one who exposed the truth to the world, being the basic reason of the dictator's windup!!Still, this doctor's escape was justified from the movie makers, since he was what exactly; less evil, or hopeless lover?!! The dialogue of the Ugandan doctor at the end summarized the confusion of this script: 'I don't know why I'm doing this. Maybe to redeem yourself and tell the world the truth about Idi Amin'?? So, what we learn from that? I'll tell you: Cheat on your crazy president, and it's fine since he's crazy! Paranoid men execute their closest men for a slight doubt, yet forgive their wives' adultery till the wife is pregnant with else's child! And yeah, the African presidents leave the ones who sleep with their wives free and harmless till they have a hostage situation in their airport!The director kept things going on so tense. The image and the pace are hot, but not like (Amin) himself. Sometimes focusing on the man's exaggerated movements was smart, and sometimes it was just boring, especially with no showing for his inside as another stereotypical psychopath who's not worth exploring. 'You're a child, so that's why you're scary' isn't an enough analysis. And after a whole movie, about a naughty doc, provided with the compulsory, forever disgusting, sex and nudity--it's naive. So with fictional story about one of (Amin)'s wives who sleeps with others to be pregnant with illegitimate son, then it's like calling the title's character names. Namely this movie didn't try to understand (Idi Amin), didn't get to show his corruption clearly, while what it did was enjoying humiliating him by fictional events. So despite the believable job that (Whitaker) did, I suspect that choosing him, with the obvious matter of his eye, was for utter deformation. But, as most of the movie, it was outwardly and false deformation more than the internal and real one.With this movie, I did see the title's character, but didn't know him. I watched a drama about a boy who falls only for the married women, where the *last king of Scotland* was another cheated husband! At the end, the Ugandan doctor says to the Scottish boy: 'Tell the world about what happened in Uganda'. Well, explicitly after the end of this movie, I needed someone to do the same for me!",4,1,3,25 December 2009
Die Hard with a Vengeance," It Can Be John MacLean's Hottest Day, But Not The Best !
","I'll tell you a story. I watched part 1, to simply fall in love with it. Then I watched part 2, to even love it more. Then I watched part 3 to not love it.. as the first 2!After a while, I re-watched the first one again to discover that it's the best at all with logic sense, explosive entertaining action, romantic core and a pioneer role with such a real affect after. Then, I re-watched the second one to discover that it's a repetitive and illogical, but still fun. Less fun. And at last, I re-watched the third again to discover that it's better than its antecedent, but with problems that don't make it as good as the first.Here the direction was gold. (John McTiernan) made the crazy action so crazy and believable in the same time (what could be cuter?!). Thank God that at the moment Hollywood hadn't been cursed with the CGI yet. (Bruce Willis) as the reckless resourceful and sarcastic (John MacLean) was super. And with (Samuel L. Jackson)'s character and performance, both of them were super. I know that (Jeremy Irons) maybe did it for fun, for money, but for me (Simon Gruber) is one of the best roles he ever did, let alone being the best villain in a Die Hard movie, being charismatic, scarily stiff and so unpredictable. (Michael Kamen)'s music embodied the feel of a cliffhanger after another, with unpeakable boiling point; here's a new word for you. And the image doesn't look less boiled itself, which's something you'll really appreciate after watching part 4! So what's the matter with it? Actually, there are 2: the script. And the editing.Maybe it was (McTiernan)'s desire. He surely wanted to outclass himself, revenge for handing the second part over director else him (so that's another meaning for the word 'revenge' in the title!), and to deliver one unforgettably big action show. Since the first one took place all in skyscraper, the second took place all in airport, then (McTiernan) aimed towards clear target: this one will take place in EVERYWHERE! I remember in one of the action movies' godfathers (That Man from Rio - 1964) the lead, played by (Jean-Paul Belmondo), drove maybe all the known vehicles. Here, I think the intention was that (MacLean) would ride a car, big truck, a metro train, a ship, a helicopter, and yes.. a bicycle, all in one day! Great intentions. And the movie just delivered some of them greatly. But to achieve that wholly without losing control, some things must be done rightly, which 'the script' is on their top.While the script was smart in dealing with action, thrill, suspense and twists-the plot was nearly unseen. The nuts terrorist with indistinct purposes who needs just one cop to run all over the city solving his Simon-says riddles was all perfect stuff. But there were some events that I didn't comprehend well unless after a third viewing! There is a collection of action sequences that run fascinatingly on screen, but while many things are running dry especially at the last third. Furthermore, the climax was too laconic compared to the rest; a bullet to an electric wire, 'Say hello to your brother', then BOOM, was not an appropriate ending for all what we were watching till this moment. It seemed like they ran out of money to make a real ending!The editing managed to make a hot funny character for the movie, but it was a little bit hyped. The editor must have had hard mission to gather that collection, with the fun scenes, the dialogue, and the story, any story. However, since the last third surely I lost something; like understanding this plot. The concoction is perceptible at places, the action is just too much at others, and it didn't make me forget, in spite of the noisy case and the changing of places, that the plot's twist, about the villain's true goal, was nearly the same of the first 2 movies!At times, it's like uproarious breathless football match more than a movie. I hate it when the movie turns into just pure exhausting action that doesn't care what the story is. So, sadly, the audience will not care too. I think that's where the problem of this movie exists. Sometimes too much fun, without any seriousness, is just a problem.Anyway, I still love it. It's so hot. Maybe more hot than the first. But that just outwardly. Because in the final analysis, it's too crowded, too fabricated, and too empty to be the best.P.S: Among many moments I love from this movie, there is one where (MacLean) comes out of catastrophic train accident so healthy and laughing. It's such a rare moment for the cinematic hero while mocking at himself as cinematic, namely: invincible!",Null,0,0,14 November 2009
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Supremacy Of The Stupidity !
","(Will Ferrell) is determined to be the typical stupid, and honestly he can do it with great intelligence and genuine originality. In (The Legend of Ron Burgundy), he plays a TV announcer from the late 1970s, who is so stupid in a brilliant way, with a bit of sarcastic criticism too. Though, unfortunately, the script wasn't as brilliant.It had no more than 3 real events only: (Veronica Corningstone) came to the station, (Burgundy) gone fired, and (Burgundy) rescued (Veronica) in the zoo. So the rest was a flood of separated sketches; some were outstanding, sharp and clever, and some weren't. Therefore, that number of separated sketches, along with the absence of the drama flow caused some kind of low satisfaction, let alone when the drama doesn't exist basically: (Veronica) forgets about (Burgundy)'s declaration of their sex life on air so easily!, (Burgundy) comes back to the station at the end so easily also!!, and what a truth when you know that the editing deleted another more and more sketches which made an enough material that created a whole new movie gone strait to video as (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie - 2004)!But despite of that, let me tell you what a wonderful substance they made in what seemed as another meaningless comedy. That was done through the unseen character of the station boss's disturbed son who developed from porn movies maniac, to drug addicted, to a killer; as the perfect result for all what this very station was presenting as the top of paltriness (a fashion show of cats?!), simply because the absence of seriousness in the media is a pure example of the culture's flatness, so the falsification of the consciousness raising; that's one excellent serious thing to say in a movie like this, especially when they consolidated it at the end in a short wicked satire: the non-enlightenment of the media men with their stupidity make them so qualified for helping some specific leaders (Steve Carell, the dullest of them all, became a counselor for president George W. Bush!). Moreover, the basic matter of the movie which's based on the stupidity of the male-partiality in certain age at the American media history (there was no reason or whatsoever for keeping the women away from this work!).There are a lot of marvelous scenes: The group's romantic song, that language between the title's character and his dog, although (Steve Martin) had one with his dog in (The Jerk), back in 1979, but (Ferrell) made it like a smart conversation between two intellectual men!, the flute's jazz show, the sex scene in a fantastic cartoon musical! But on the other hand, you'll find some of the worst bad tasting: throwing the dog over the bridge, the dog defecates in the refrigerator, and couple of obscene lines.As for the acting, (Ferrell) was hilarious but with some overacting at parts. (Applegate) did a wonderful job, so all the guest stars, BUT (Steve Carell) stole the show, proving that he is a true unique talent, enjoying us in many wonderful scenes, which made me wonder.. was it the writing of (Ferrell), or the improvisation of (Carell)?? Well.. maybe both!I think the most beautiful thing in here is not only the talent of (Will Ferrell), as a writer and comedian, but also the movie's assertion about the fact that being a star is a matter which has no relevant with being intelligent. So it's simple as well as logical to have an announcer like (Burgundy) who made it to the top of success and fame with this horrific condition of dangerous stupidity before his deep ignorance.",7,1,1,24 August 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Sillier Than Fiction !
","At first, it was the relationship between the writer and her written character; namely something that original, marvelous, and rich. Especially from the written character point of view as a creature who doesn't understand his own tortures, and tries to understand them with his self, life, fate. But what we saw was farther away anything good which you could've had from that.Maybe it's the worst treatment to this ambitious idea. Or maybe it's, with its own defects, a less ambitious than the idea. For instance, how this writer got this supernatural capacity to control one's life or fate?, and how this written character in specific managed to communicate with this kind of goddess who controls all his life and death but not his will? So without any explanations, the movie's plot owns its rank as one of the most childish plots ever talked about such a relationship between a creator and the creator's creation, since Pygmalion!Moreover, I hated that contact between the 2 lines which broke the symbolic case to reach a limit where (Will Ferrell)'s character was asked to die just to make one novel as good and successful?? And the weirder, or the sillier, that he agrees! Honestly, (Dustin Hoffman) and (Will Ferrell) looked so unbelievably idiotic at that scene: 'You must die, so the novel can be whole and perfect!', and when (Ferrell) incomprehensibly surrenders, the novelist just saves him, and why? Because 'The one who knows that he's going to die, and goes,.. deserves life'!! Surly that's the utmost degree of naivety I've ever seen dramatically and intellectually. Because the one who goes to die plainly like that is the one who deserves death indeed. But the one who 'believes' in his fate - or the very one that the whole film is grounded on boosting him - is the one who really has faith in God, the ultimate power, not by any chance some depressed writer who loves to kill her characters just to empty her sadness. Otherwise, this is a really odious blasphemy. So as you see, it's bad both ways!It's in this very brittle plot (particularly when you think did the writer's previous characters actually die before or not?!), and in that lousy basis in the first place (a writer's pen draws factual destinies of real people!). Therefore, the brilliant idea melted in the middle of this immature manipulation, and the story's good meanings become eventually incompatible: You must cherish your life which you'll live freely by your will. To activate your true selections, you must believe in fate that can select you in a higher will. You have to believe in higher will also to achieve its superior wisdom, and live for yourself and others (the lead saved his love from prison, then saved the boy from the bus). All of those meanings were so mixed up in so mixed up plot; hence the story's originality and sweetness were destroyed, especially with that fabricated happy ending too. It could be a perfect case of having a symbolic story where the symbol was bigger than its story, which lessened the persuasion and the amusement.Despite the astonishing performance of (Will Ferrell), and some good points, it's a project of a different and well-meaning film that ended up weak and absurd.",2,0,0,7 May 2008
Kingpin," Scary Movie !
","It could be not only the worst comedy in 1996, but one of the worst in the history of cinema. 'Horrible' is a little word to describe everything and everyone in here. For Bobby and Peter Farrelly, putting message in a movie would be something they would do later, because at the days of (Dumb & Dumber - 1994) and (There's Something About Mary - 1998), they were in the dumb zone, playing the adolescent game of who can come up with dirtier stuff than the other?! They were determined not to make nice time, only an ocean of sperms & spews which stands for nice time for them! If being a comedy means making me laugh, then this one didn't make me laugh or smile. Instead, it made me feel how sickening that was, how easy making nauseating comedies is, and how scary culture might degenerate. Without an atom of exaggeration, movies like this prove the collapse of civilizations, and the withdrawal of man to savagery. Funny for you or not, just give it some thinking, and maybe, just maybe, you'll be as scared as me.",1,2,13,26 August 2009
Hancock," Betrays its Own New Formula !
","A romantic comedy mixed with the superhero movie. OK. No.. Not OK!Among the superhero craze during the 2000s, this movie earns being so special duo to its different formula. Director (Peter Berg) tried to be as different by caring about the characters more than the explosions. The always shaking camera, the many close-ups.. all of that worked in terms of being more sensitive and less action driven. Though I HATED the endless rounds around Hancock's face after the bank's crisis; they went on and on dizzily. (Will Smith) dazzled me in a real sane performance, one of his best, as drunken loser superman, showing the rising of the 'man' behind the 'super' seriously and comically as well (You have to enjoy watching him saying 'Good Job'!). However, the movie's biggest mistake is betraying itself in the third act.In a foolish way, not a novel one that befits the novelty of the whole thing, the movie deprived its time of comedy. Till the funny moment at the kitchen, then the big 'hurricane' fight in the street, the comedy was on, along with the romance, the action, and the fantasy. After that, exactly in the somewhat long sequence of the hospital, (Charlize Theron)'s heavily teary performance, the very weak evil men, and the detestable bloody violence; turned the movie suddenly into something other than itself. So we felt wrong, with darker taste; as if it's another movie; too sullen, more melodramatic and less attractive!For simple example, when the viewers watched how the lead dealt with the 2 bully criminals in the prison, they laughed. But when the movie makes them both the ruthless killers later, the comic situation loses its soul, becoming just ugly.At the final 5 minutes, the things don't get any better, on the contrary; it's messy whereas the heroine chooses someone while we all know that she loves another more??, then drawing on the moon??, and a last shot with one thief re-says the same insult which we all know that the lead hates?? This is unfunny and unnecessary!Some said that the surprises of the third act are the problem. I believe not. I loved those surprises very much. It's rather the disturbance that hit the formula. Now I understood why that script was refused by production companies for 9 years. It's not being different, it's being dissonant!They wanted to make totally another superhero movie, and they did. The thing is.. it wasn't totally even. 2/3 of it realizes its ambitious formula, but as a whole, it ends up as uneven ambitious movie. It's where I hate to say 'mediocre' about a movie that is not based on comics, not about CGI mainly, not having usual story, and not having (Tobey Spiderman Maguire)!",6,0,3,25 February 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best Of The Worst !
","It's the best because, compared to the previous 2 prequels, there were things that made the movie suitable for a second viewing, like: a good opening sequence consisted of half hour of powerful action, good climactic sequence which was another half hour of powerful action, the music of (John Williams) especially 'The Battle of The Heroes', the final 2 parallel sword duels; that was great, (Yoda) as a perfect CGI this time; thanks to the talents behind it, how all the CGI wasn't that trite, some real creative backgrounds, and the clever dramatic meaning about the end of democracy and how the dictator could rule; which made me ask: did (George Lucas) refer to American contemporary issues at the time through (Star Wars)?!, and the smartness of pulling down the parliament by one savage power that wants to destroy freedom along with everyone and everything, but itself.However, it's not one of the best movies as well: just remember the great performance of (Hayden Christensen), and the greater performance of (Ian McDiarmid). In fact, in very few times in my life, I watched acting as astoundingly bad as THIS! (McDiarmid) in the scene of his deformity presented a clear example for all the students of acting all over the world as the ideal 'Don't do this at home', in one word; this scene in particular was the ugliest point of the whole new trilogy and the ugliest performance I've ever seen in recent American movies too. Moreover, the stupidity of (Anakin Skywalker)'s transformation; (Lucas), as a writer, made him decide to go to the dark side in a way easier than anybody deciding to eat burger or sausage. Even the transformation into vegetarian could have been more confusing and daring move than the one we watched!Although (George Lucas) was much sane and dexterous as a director here, but as some kind of a fan of the old trilogy myself, I began to think that (Lucas) went to the dark side of the Force when he decided to make those 3 prequels which I can't imagine that there is one human being that can love or stand them all.. At all!",6,4,7,25 April 2008
Ray," TV Movie With Cinematic Star !
","Although it did a good job, but I had to hate this script. The main conflict here is (Ray)'s belief that he accidentally killed his younger brother. So he went to drugs to just escape this incredible pain. Therefore, the man got himself in 2 lives; one where he's supposedly balanced as a husband and father, and another where he has the artist in him perfectly, with bohemian living, mistresses, and drugs. Accordingly, the movie just finds purgation for its lead when he finally makes peace with his original pain, and believes that he got no hand in killing his breather (read: Pure Nonsense!).The peacemaking scene, which's the movie's climax, was really weak and totally unconvincing. The script wanted to abbreviate the whole psychotherapy in one artistic scene, OK, but in the same time, I didn't understand How or Why his dead brother hugged him, acquitting him from the crime: 'You didn't do it'??!! Not to mention that originally I wasn't satisfy with this complex as the character's main problem.(Ray Charles), who I knew from this very movie, was a man with 2 dilemmas. He couldn't live peacefully with his conservative wife, being a good sober father. And he couldn't live 'madness all the time' with his mistress. He even was traditional at times, and a historically revolutionary at others. So the main conflict wasn't about a man and his inner pain concerning his dead brother inasmuch as other ones concerning: being himself or any other, living the guaranteed or being that adventurer, needing love and family to live stability vs. needing sex and drugs to make art, suffering from the dark or leading everybody!This script provoked me even at minor points. For instance, when the wife blames her junky husband as someone who doesn't care about his kids, she tells a story about a trophy that the son has won, and his too drunken father who didn't see it; why we didn't watch such an important accident and cinematic moment?!! Moreover, why the character of the loyal wife was out of the picture for most of the time? For someone who doesn't know the real happenings, such as me, I thought that the woman divorced him, and this movie didn't have the time to declare it! I needed to observe her reaction to all of his works, especially his other unchained life.
And I couldn't understand the matter of firing the assistant near the end. So he made a secret business for his own, and (Ray) doesn't want someone that deals with him as a 'blind', however we already knew that by heart when (Ray) rebelled against his 2 monopolists at the start, so why to repeat it?!, particularly in a movie that doesn't find something fair to end itself with; the incomprehensible - very easy - forgiveness of his brother, a sudden tasteless board, some award, a stock shot.. and that's it! Actually, you have to feel how strangely laconic that was.(Ray) was revolutionary, but this movie is not. It's still a good movie though. The direction got its moments, but it's clear that the man's extraordinary life hasn't been treated extraordinarily. I was sad that it wasn't made for TV. It got all the aspects of a TV biography, except the performance. (Jamie Foxx) isn't a magician, he's magic; mimicking the character to a scary extent sometimes, while living the personality as well. He won the Oscar already; however, with a better script he, with us, would've won smarter movie about (Ray Charles).",Null,0,0,21 June 2009
Shooter," When Fiction Speaks The Truth !
","Now this is an action thriller to live long.In this script, (Rambo) meets (The Fugitive) in a very good way. It gives us hot conflict, action, and - surprisingly - serious points. True that all the factors were used hundreds of times before, like: kill the friend, frame the innocent, kidnap the girl to threaten the good guy, or having a helpful sidekick, a noble hero who doesn't die tragically, and an eraser solution for the big gamers lastly.. but it worked, sometimes highly. For instance, look at the meeting in the snow, where the hidden shooters have been killed one by one by another, smarter, hidden shooter; this is unusual stuff for what's supposed to be usual short scene. Or how there is always someone to spell out the missing facts, and answer most of the questions, though this time it was 'for keeping you till they come, and it must be the truth otherwise you'd leave!'. And it got more than a hot time..The thing about the political satire is that it's so familiar nowadays to pick up the evil guys from the newspaper's front page, namely out of the politicians or the president's men. For one reason, they got out of their holiness since Watergate, and for another, the common evil guys ran out of gloss already. Let alone how powerful they are, and how hateful they can be too. But when it comes to (Shooter), it's not another (Absolute Power - 1997)'s dealing where the president of the Untied States is totally insane bad guy. It has politically involved evil guys, and a political point of view as well.Although the characterization fits another commercial Hollywood moneymaker, but not with a peaceful manner this round. Here, you'll hear great lines like when the corrupt Senator (Charles F. Meachum) speaks his mind freely: 'There are no sides. There are no Sunnis and Shiites. There's no Democrats and Republicans. There's only haves and have-nots.', or: 'This is a country, where the Secretary of Defense can go on TV, and tell the American public, oh, that this is about freedom! It's not about oil! And nobody questions him, because they don't wanna hear the answer, because it's a lie!'. It's obvious, so bitter, remark about the filthy war in Iraq, which links up perfectly with Mr. (Rate) character's remark, which I loved the most, about the big lies: 'They also said that artificial sweeteners were safe, WMDs were in Iraq, and Anna Nicole married for love.' They are great lines, simply because they're true!There is such a striking satire against the plots of the undeclared American policy since (J.F.K) assassination: notice well how the crime scene, in the movie, is so unquestionably similar to the one of (Kennedy)'s, how eliminating the killers fast is a security move to hide the higher real conspirators which's mentioned clearly in the movie's dialogue, then see the similarity between the name of the movie's lead (Bob Lee Swagger) and the name of (Kennedy)'s supposed assassin, who had been killed vaguely, (Lee Harvey Oswald). Actually the movie, while being the fair fare, connects angrily and finely many hidden plots from the 1960, in latent way, with the recent wars in Ethiopia or Iraq, however in explicit way, to assure that power and money were the real motives all along. And it's no mistake if you find yourself asking where did I see before that shot of that fat bald Senator, played by (Ned Beatty), firing a shotgun near the camera in hunting gear, because the answer is quite known: it's (Dick Cheney); the Vice President of (George W. Bush) at the moment, or as what (David Letterman) used to call him: 'The Lie Count'!The script's only point of weakness remains at its last 10 minutes. Yes, the lead had to burn his important evidence, the mobile's record, just to ensure his life until getting to the investigation's authority. Yes, he had his proof of innocence within his gun. But any of these, if managed to keep him alive and prove him not guilty, doesn't relate a thing to Colonel (Isaac Johnson), played by (Danny Glover), at all. So it was so naive moment when they showed the committee of investigation the photos of the massacre of Ethiopia; this is in no way a childish conviction, or a complete 'blank shot'. Moreover, when the movie triumphs eventually for the bloody justice of revenge as a substitute for the incapable law, it's nothing but easy, so tacky, even predictable solution that lowered (Shooter) to be a (Death Wish) movie, with high quality and earnest talk!The direction made a close to flawless job. Every minute was catchy and masterful, with plentiful satisfying action. The acting wasn't that great, but the script didn't go deep much, so it kind of served the main aims. It's only (Michael Peña) as (Memphis) who seemed like clueless idiot, and (Glover)'s voice that seemed utterly sick. The music didn't try to emphasize any important sense, or leave any effect.Despite anything, this above average entertaining movie will live long indeed. After years, hope not to be too long, it will be re-watched with more appreciation for being that bold at its time, to say the truth about what not many of the major studios' movies dared to even speak about or hint to. Hence, with assured next books, TV shows, etc. that will say the truth about the 2000s decade, the other Vietnam (or Vietnams!), and the real motives--this movie will be there and ready. Sometimes, fiction has truth more than what reality does!",7,1,2,26 February 2010
Inception," Inception: Part 1, and Part 2 !
","Some are possessed of the movie. I'm not. Let's see why.It's The Matrix meets J. I. Goe (the bad movie, not the TV show!). At the first half, there is one wild and fascinating world, that we didn't see much before, with gripping special details. Then, the whole second half is ill with vacuum and bore. Sometimes it felt like trashy bang bang flick. The shootout at the snow was provocatively vague and long to the extent that I wanted to sleep. The dream within a dream within a dream within a dream status aimed at complicated distinct suspense, but ended up as nearly confusing and too much.Some plot holes bugged me. For instance, how the lead always gets a gun that easily? (Many points like that were left unexplained), how one phone call can terminate all the crimes of one? And I didn't believe the chase of Mombassa. (Leonardo DiCaprio) didn't convince me very. Yes, he's a handsome star for a blockbuster, but not a great talent though.The matter of salvation, out of importunate sin, can be considered a groundwork in almost all of (Christopher Nolan)'s movies yet. Continually his lead is running unsuccessfully from a crime he committed, to the salvation of confessing it at last. Notice well how his leads are chased by a sin, while they're chasing else, not too irrelevant, matters like the killer of his wife (Memento - 2000), the killer who witnessed the wrong kill (Insomnia - 2002), a reconciliation between a father and son or - in fact - between a husband and himself (Inception). (Inception)'s end is happy, since no matter the lead dreams or not (I'm with the second answer), he won his salvation by his confession about murdering his wife unintentionally. Clearly (Nolan) seems burdened by the Catholic sin and its pressing towards the conscience. The thing is he somehow remade the crisis of (Memento)'s lead in (Inception). So I was asking: 'Where did I see all of that storyline before'?!There is a point that drew my attention in terms of (Saito)'s character and his own agenda. Was he, so the movie, anti-monopolization? Or do his goals, right or wrong, not matter at all? If it's about doing the job, ethical or not, then it is interesting issue in a movie with the moral of 'do the right thing'.I loved the boldness of the imagination, some lines like 'The pain is in the mind' or 'The ones who love each others share the same pains', and for sure the music score of (Hans Zimmer); it expressed the uniqueness of the movie's world, its inscrutability and danger cleverly, compensating big part of the movie's problems; which's a job filming in many countries, a la (James Bond)'s movies, didn't pull it off strongly! By the way, the movie's trailer has a music track named 'Mind Heist', and it's mistakenly attributed to (Zimmer), while it's written by (Zack Hemsey). It's genius piece of music that caught the movie's spirit, and uttered it fascinatingly.(Inception) is a different movie to entertain. 9 years is an enough time to write it. I bet that time was spend over the intro sequence along with the first half! Anyway, the movie managed to guarantee big budget, seducing A-list star, being full of action, thrill, and gunfights, bewitching you with engaging images and atmospheres, grossing millions all over the world, yet not achieving the same high success as a movie with a meaning. You may deem it sophisticated nonsense, a marvelous remake of (Memento), or just new sci-fi thriller; half exceptional, half weak!When all the team survived at the end, I thought that was made for allowing part 2. If there will ever be one, I'll wait for it. Hope it'll be as dazzling as the first half, less blank than the second, more fresh than (Nolan)'s over pressing sins.",6,0,8,6 May 2011
The Good Shepherd," Once Upon Time In The CIA !
","The intention was great. The history of the CIA, with the controversial concept of the good shepherd. The drama of that character. This is all good, but too much also!First of all, it's that desire of making a mini-series out of one movie. The multiplying story lines, along with some actors who looked superficially the same, not to mention the boring pace of (Matt Damon)-all of that managed well to distract us all the way.(De Niro) as a director made only one movie 13 years earlier, (A Bronx Tale - 1993), and what a fine movie it was. But in here, he wanted to make an epic, like Sergio Leone's epic about America (Once Upon a Time in America - 1984), Scorsese's epic about the mob (Goodfellas - 1990), or about Las Vegas (Casino - 1995), where he was the lead actor in all of them. Though (The Good Shepherd) turned out to be something like the trilogy of (The Godfather) inharmoniously packed together in the same time!Over and above: the casting! Despite all the effort that (Matt Damon) did, he wasn't the suitable man for the job. He looked 25 years old all along, especially in front of (Angelina Jolie) who looked 10 years older than him. He wasn't the man with the stony face, who seems that he has all the secrets of the world. You can say that again about the first nominated actor for the role (Leonardo DiCaprio). Because to tell you the truth, the best man for such a role was (De Niro) himself, but when he was younger.Another defect which's quite fatal: the implicit supposition that the audience knows the background of the events, the characters, or even the intimations. For instances, as a poor man myself from where exactly may I know that in the spying business tying the shoe is a signal to watchers that the meeting went badly?, or that (Joe Pesci) was representing a real wise guy?, or the truth about (Ulysses)? In fact, I knew all of that by reading about the movie, not from the movie itself!After 167 min of extremely jammed script, unexplained events, too many characters, boring presence; mainly from (Damon), you might feel horrible rejection for that movie, despite the good music, cinematography, and intention. It's where the ambitions are bigger than the resources, and The Good Shepherd isn't really good.",Null,0,1,22 June 2008
Prometheus," Expensive Garbage !
","While Ridley Scott's (Prometheus - 2012) alleges a new story and viewpoint, it's his (Alien - 1979) all over again, with nearly the same characters, atmosphere, and maybe events; including ones from other Alien movies. True it's done with huge budget and more ambition, but sorrowfully filled with dumb uninteresting everything!This round, it's not about the dangerous unknown, being represented in unintelligible monster, nope, it's about who mainly has created the known and the unknown; namely god, or - in the movie's viewpoint - gods. That looks deeper and catchier, putting in mind mixing it with the 'thrill', 'horror', 'sci-fi', and 'action' factors. But don't get so much excited, because this movie replays its stately original badly, while merely replacing the unintelligible monster with unintelligible monster god; which happens to be way less powerful, and less cool by the way!You must get lost amongst clips from the previous movie, or movies, the weak plot, and the unanswered or postponed questions: Why David secretly infected Holloway with the ampoule's dark liquid of the so-called engineers? If the dark liquid was in our water since ages, why the humanity didn't turn sick, giving birth to monsters like what happened with Holloway and Elizabeth? What is that dark liquid in the first place?? Why Weyland is kept in the ship without anybody knowing except David and Vickers? And what could be the point of Vickers being the daughter of Weyland? (Ok, that guy must have given birth to her while he was 170 year old!), why Vickers forgot all about Shaw after Weyland's death, wanting to go back to earth without her? The event of 'let's destroy the god's ship for saving the earth' seemed like a made-up James Bond climax for a movie that didn't have any. And all the matter of 'I'm pregnant with a monster', aside from being repeated from the Alien series, it's too forced to be believed, they like affixed it after the script was completely written, just to fabricate a reason makes this pathetic remake a late prequel!The rubbish talk about those engineers as the gods was killing me out of rage! Whoever wrote it needs a serious religious help. I know he has all the right in the world to imagine and argue, but ultimately, he went to nothing. His script is sort of soulless and mindless. It doesn't reach to a proper result; otherwise the gods are destructive creatures, they sleep then wait and wait and wait to be awaken, so they can re-continue destruction. What's this? (P.S: add a psychological help as well!). The thing is the script provided some sophisticated-like 'questions' for the sake of upgrading a 'thriller', while not answering the questions or making any great thriller at last. What a shame!The character of Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace, seemed at the end as a take on Ripley, the heroine of the original movie played by Sigourney Weaver. Clearly they wanted to recreate a new heroine, with another history, trait, and aspects. This one is more interested in 'knowing' more than 'fighting the alien'. However, that intention made a hideous irony with the movie's hoped for intellectual side, especially after the fallen of it eventually, and your discovering that there was no top action or thrill along the way either. So it came down to the ugly fact that this movie nearly had no goods to sell! The character of David, as performed by Michael Fassbender, had a lot of potential. It could fit a movie of its own. But alas. It didn't do much here in the middle of this mess of many uncompleted stuff!I was disappointed the most in Ridley Scott. I longed for something from the Midas Touch that brought us earlier the original Alien of 1979. But he directed this lousy remake / prequel as another Hollywood sci-fi thriller, which didn't present much as a sci-fi or thriller. And its theory about god, the creation of life, etc. was laughable. Plus the way it linked itself to the Alien series was terrible. Come to think of it; if this movie wanted to give info about the origin of Alien, then what did it annex? That when half human half god-like freak rapes a dying god-like, then their bastard is The Alien??!!The most, or only, perfect thing that this movie ever did; had to be the exotic backgrounds which embodied the unknown seductively, plus couple of nicely created and excused sci-fi details; the really inspiring 'disclosing flying puppies' and the so-wild-it's-a-bit-creepy 'entirely electronic surgery'.Prometheus is actually nothing but a reboot for the Alien franchise, so it may be launched again into a whole new series of movies, a la many reboot movies done lately such as Casino Royale (2006), Star Trek (2009), Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012). As the movie's Weyland, Hollywood wants to live forever, but it must search for another god else remaking, otherwise it will end up being exactly like Weyland; insanely rich, awfully old, and spending astronomical sums for trying failed tricks to live longer!My title is the first thing I have said after finishing this failed trick.",3,7,10,3 January 2013
Back to the Future Part II," Exploitation at its Puffiest !
","I was shocked when I first saw it. Since I'm not another fan of (Back to the Future - 1985), rather I'm in love with it, I expected something as great. But I was wrong. Because this is a cheap profiteering out of it and nothing more!The writing is the only criminal here. It's clear how they tried desperately to make up anything for a sequel after the success of the first. So they exhausted themselves very much to fabricate this one, with so many time-games and reediting for the first one's main events. While the more original, less exploitative efforts were saved for the third installment.The script tries to invent whatever fits the (Back to The Future)'s title, so the leads must do what they do, on one condition; ending with coming back to the future. Look at this plot: We got to see the future, then we return to the present to find it destroyed because someone of the very future went to the past earlier so he destroyed the actual present, hence the leads had to go back to the past to repair it, then go BACK TO THE FUTUER. This is what makes the difference between the first movie as 'creation' and the second as 'utilization'!Except the almanac factor, nothing could have happened in the first place. Originally, this sequel itself looks like almanac for the first movie's world, and all what they did was messing with it! The scenes of the first (Back..) are reused during the first and third acts (the restaurant's mess, the action after, the home's talking, the 50s party..) with only new clothes. I was between sick and embarrassed due to endless 'Don't meet your other self' matters. Actually, the repeating of 'This is heavy', 'A deja-vu', and maybe 'I'll destroy the time-machine' could mirror the movie makers' real weariness out of the manipulation that they were doing to their fine work!There was trite point like how (Biff) confesses all about his secrets to his wife's son easily! But this is nothing compared to a huge plot hole I noticed; when the old (Biff) stole the car, along with the almanac, then went into the past, he came back to 'his' future to find it totally unharmed??!! It's intuitive, and according to the movie's logic as well, that when he traveled, he already changed the time, so he would return to totally another future; the future of him as rich in rotten city, not coming back to his own time in the same neighborhood as if he rode the time-machine along the blocks!And to make it worse and worse; it missed the substance. The first contains a sort of romantic comedy about girl-loves-boy and this boy-doesn't-love her so he-goes-to-unite-her-with-another, not to mention a message about being active; taking the right decision in the right time to fulfill it. The third part got a love story too where the doc falls in love; that's a character development to remember passionately. Simply, that what gives the movie, any movie, a serious place in our hearts. However, this poor one got nothing of this sort. Why they didn't give every sequel a certain meaning or lesson? It's how movies didn't age badly, or age at all.Anyway, it managed to be somehow solid and entertaining all along, yet as a huge comic book which's surely less important and more puffy than the other 2 movies. So, eventually, when it comes to love; what could be really loved from it? Well, it's easy; the funny details of the future, (Elisabeth Shue) as the new (Jennifer), and seeing the characters of the original hit ride again.. But not quite hit again!",6,0,4,23 November 2009
Blow," Artless !
","So what's here that we didn't see in - for instance - (Goodfellas - 1990)? I can answer that; the end's surprise when we discover that the lead's daughter is just a daydream which the lead has as a simple desire of a sinful man who cursed himself by privation, and the impossibility of connecting with what's natural or satisfying. Save that, everything was repeated, usual or artless.The script is a long embodiment of any talk you watched before in (60 minutes). How could the direction agree with that? It did nothing either to polish the old and torn material!I believe that there are 2 (Johnny Depp). One is vigorous and creative, doing his work with love (Benny & Joon, Ed Wood..). And one - on the contrary - is indifferent and rather lifeless, doing his work with the least efforts (The Astronaut's Wife, Once Upon a Time in Mexico..). It's obvious what kind of (Depp) that (Blow) has. He wanted the money, being in the market, whatever. His sense of being uninterested was more than noticeable.(Penélope Cruz) is unsightly ridiculous here. Yes, I don't like her, but objectively she performed better in other movies. I thought this was one of her worst, especially the scenes of her as bugging hag!I despised the countless scenes of doing drugs. They seemed given feely sometimes. Sure many moviemakers mirror themselves in their movies. And some of them do the same in terms of those scenes in specific (maybe as a cry of help out of addiction, or maybe for dyeing this very addiction as ordinary!). Anyway, after knowing that the movie's director (Ted Demme) died due to cocaine, within less than a year of (Blow)'s release, you have to put 2 and 2 together!The last shot of the real (George Jung), as a smiling tragedy, is the only truthful moment. However, sorrowfully, it assures (Blow)'s character as a documentary more than a dramatic movie. The thing is whether the makers of it didn't ask themselves my question; what's here that we didn't see in other, not too far, better movies? Or they didn't watch these movies in the first place!As a docudrama, it's kind of fair. And as a movie, it's poor version of richer ones.",3,0,2,9 January 2011
1408," From Stroke to Strike !
","The matter of a closed haunted room is fabulous. It's a new shape for a horror, and with one place, one character; it's another (Die Hard) yet against supernatural unseen powers, plus it's a film of a movie as well; where room 1408 equals a moment in which the person meets nobody but himself, facing his conscience's ghosts in inescapable trial. But.. did our dear movie realize any of that? Well, that's the problem. While having unusual potential, it - stupidly - chose to be usual. Let's see the shamefully easy way to achieve everything.(John Cusack) as a lead? BOO. BOOO. BOOOO! This guy is not that talented, let alone being uncharismatic to the MAX. So baring watching him, for all the time, without seeing someone else, was impossible. A more expensive star, not greater actor, like (Bruce Willis) could have been less provoking, since at least he has a charisma. But (Cusack) was fitter because he demands low fee. Knowing that we're in a horror, nothing was more horrific than Cusack's performance at the moment of 'BUT I WAS OUT, I WAS OUT, I WAS OUTTTTTT'. Mr. (Cusack), I hoped you were out.. of the movie!No doubt that the rich idea met a poor dealing. The script uses many empty circles for just filling the time with 'some frightening anything'; recorded phone calls, timer radio runs suddenly, ghosts walk in one specific way, etc. It has counted freaky gags as the same as what any silly Tom Arnold movie has, yet purely!The theatrical end is terrible, I don't know who's the fool who put it there. So the daughter's voice was real; what can I, or anyone in the world, gain out of that?!! And remember, this totally meaningless moment was for ending happily with (John Cusack) alive, JOHN CUSACK ALIVE!!!!!! Kill the bore for god's sake, and for the horror's sake as well! Later, I watched the alternative ending; it's so wonderfully dark, hence more suitable. Obviously this time, with tame everything, choosing tame ending was devastating!Some points were correctly realized though; the sound effects; being the real lead of this movie, brilliant few moments like meeting the father or having a fax of the daughter's dress, and part of the music. And No, don't wait for me to say (Samuel L. Jackson). He didn't do it coolingly as he could have!1408 = disappointing whether as a horror, different Die Hard version, or serious film about meeting the ugliness of oneself. It's where being mediocre means weak compared to its potential. Here's a movie that could have been a stroke of genius, but ended up as a strike of genius. Uncreative and cheap are the right words to diagnose why.P.S: meeting (Samuel L. Jackson) in the refrigerator was laughable in the wrong place. Tells you how the makers of this movie don't know a lot about the basics of horror.",Null,0,1,25 February 2011
Any Given Sunday," Overdose !
","Somewhere I read that (Oliver Stone) has mixed 3 screenplays in one to make (Any Given Sunday). When you watch the movie, you must believe that as the truth. (Stone) is a knight among Hollywood directors. He fights the American system and foundations burningly and unstoppably. You have to notice his basic creed through nearly all of his works; he was fierily against the military foundation in (Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Heaven & Earth), the political foundation, so the intelligence (JFK, Nixon), corporate raid (Wall Street), the media (Natural Born Killers), so why not to take on the sport foundation as well. However, this time, something was not bad, but too much. It was really about to be too-much-it's-bad!We have a movie about a noble man against a system (values vs. money), a movie about a coach and a player (team vs. self), and a third one about a team that had to survive despite its own breakdown. (Stone) didn't want to lose any part of the big picture he was drawing, trying his best to present all the story lines, the satire, and the bitter details that he can tell about such a 'world', however in one movie. And the result is an intensive movie, but so heavy. I had to watch it 3 times to catch on its treat in complete.True that (Stone) managed to gather a lot of things by his distinct style without being adolescently manipulative or showy, but nothing can deny that the final product gives you the fatigue. There are almost 10 characters with hot drama and something to satirize also; I bet the characterization was such an exhausting job for the writers here. So sometimes you feel that this is an abbreviated TV series in strenuous 150 minutes; which feels like longer than that! Yes, the editing tried to collect the many pieces, keep the (Stone) flavor, and maintain a fast paced movie in the same time, though it's nothing but a violent long video clip in many places. Now and then, it forces you to lose any concentration you have.I think it's like a cinematic novel in the frame of a movie. The sense to speak omnisciently and deeply ruined somehow the desire to be that watchable movie. Sure it delivers its very good case and commentary, but in someway forfeits its balance as a drama while the main personality of the whole thing is torn between being a simple story about how the 'team' is more important that the 'self', and being an epic about deadly tyrannical modern empire that makes the gladiators to kill them.Unlike many movies that have similar problems, (Any Given Sunday) isn't slothful, but of course thick with a director who refuses to cut much of what he says. Till now I can't believe how (James Caviezel) and (Tom Sizemore) played roles that were eventually deleted, which means that this movie would've been something like 3 hours long already! Look at the closing credits displaying on the last 10 minutes; obviously they didn't want to make it any longer, so they put them while very serious event at the very end, which has been badly appeared because of this kind of dealing.Anyway, it needs to be watched more than once to be fully understood, so to relish its own kind of enjoyment, and its real profound metaphors. (Stone) was right about so many issues here, but he wasn't right only when it came to making an engaging facile movie out of wide wild Film. He succeeded in that brilliantly before, for instance in (Wall Street). But, here, the dose gave me an impressive headache. Watch it 3 times to experience well the 3 movies that it is. 3 smart ones by the way, but weren't made entirely in just smart one.",6,0,0,19 February 2009
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman, Superman, and the Audience vs. Dr. Frankenstein !
","I watched the Ultimate Edition, with the 180 minutes long, right after its release. And after being tortured by it, I read a news flash that said 'The Ultimate Edition is the version of Batman v Superman that the fans wanted all along!'. Well, enough with the lying you big corporations! You're like a Hitchcock villain; kills his mother, and pretends in front of everybody that she's alive!!Hollywood's sin presently is mind eradication. They own everything; the money, the distribution, the stars, the high-tech, etc.. with no mind whatsoever. They became stupid, or want us to become stupid, or - oh dear god - it's both!Speaking of stupidity; scriptwriters Charles Roven, Deborah Snyder, and director Zack Snyder!!Simply, look at the movie they made. It's a big mess of many unfinished movies. You have Batman and Superman hating each other in utterly forced way; since they're very much alike. You have Wonder Woman whose her name wasn't even uttered, and her agenda was mostly vague. You have scenes with the leads of the next Justice League sequel that distract you horribly. You have 3 Batman nightmares. One of them has a dream within a dream and is absolutely incomprehensible, with dark future, fly-like warriors, ruthless Superman and 'Lois is the key'??!! It's like running into a short story in the middle of a novel while none of them is completed or understood, otherwise this is the result of writing while being on drugs! You have a long talk about Superman as the god, prophet, devil.. whatever, that sounds deep and philosophical while being nothing but mumbo jumbo. You have Lex Luthor who we don't know why he hates the title characters, or why he wants to destroy them. Originally how this guy is the movie's evil mastermind, while he maunders embarrassingly during giving a public speech?! You have general Zod who got resurrected as the indestructible Doomsday confusingly. And you have a silly last-second-hint that Superman is alive, a la the end of X-Men: The Last Stand and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen; so why killing him in the first place???!!!Every minute there is a stupid point; as if it's a marathon of an intentional dumbness. Try to stand: Batman's costume to face Superman was laughable, being 2 times the globally sneered at size of Judge Dredd costumes in the 1995 movie! I didn't catch on how Batman got the Kryptonite from Luthor's men on the harbor; and that's because the movie's stupidity, not mine. Btw, why Superman was there; peculiarity when he shows up suddenly?! Luthor gets an access to Superman's ship so easily, and Superman doesn't know or sense a thing about that?! Superman hears Lois's knocks under the water, knows the exact second of her falling off Luthor's building, however doesn't feel his mother's kidnapping at all??!! Kevin Costner plays the most unnecessary cameo ever. I dare you to explain the connection between his talk and the movie, and I double dare you to explain his presence here (a daydream, a flashback, a ghost appearance, a Kryptonite way to talk to the dead, a fast visit to heaven??). A nuclear bomb explodes Superman, who turns into a skeleton already, and then he's healthy again.. How? Well, don't wait for an explanation from a fool! And Superman is killed in his second movie?? It's not revolutionary move, it's mighty stupidity that merely wants to cash in the success of The Avengers, by making Justice League ASAP while saying 'We Don't Care About The Fans!' (it's the same stupidity that wrote v in the title instead of vs.!). Superman mails a ring to Lois, before his death, which his mother receives?? And the crown's jewel: 'Martha', or the moment that will live forever to assure how real drama is killed in Hollywood at this age that we're living!It runs like a boring spy thriller for 2 hours, then voilà it's an action. All the cast punches you, speedily and unstoppably, with an info or a dialogue. Why this provocative hurry??!! You want a snappy pace, fine. But it is a problem when it fails to deliver what's required, and a serious headache when your scenes are endless. Some lines are disgusting: 'Take a bucket of pi*s and call it Granny's Peach Tea!', 'With balls like yours, you belong to here!'. Alfred, Batman's butler, is now an old drunk, or crack addict, with nothing funny or unfunny to say. And the face of Gal Gadot, who played Wonder Woman, is dead. No, it's death itself!Superman is shirtless more than Shah Rukh Khan in a hot number. Lois is nude in a tub, then Superman gets nude, and has sex with her. A scene for Batman showering in the nude. So this is the way how these figures get to be mature??? I believe this is immatureness, and cheap commercialism, in their perfect image!I loved the idea of Jesse Eisenberg as young Mark Zuckerberg-like villain, Wonder Woman's theme music, and couple of action scenes which indicated that Snyder could fit as action sequences director ONLY!Batman v Superman is a mix of awful drama, super tedium, hideous grittiness, alleged philosophy, all played with some action, great confidence and - let's not forget - shaky cam for the realism! As if the law nowadays is: Give insane amount of money to stupid people to make neither art nor entertainment. Actually it's how the blockbusters transformed into brainless, heartless, and soulless cyclopean monsters in the last 20 years.Hollywood becomes uglier over the years. And with many movies of that kind; it's turning into monsters' creator. Rather a nefarious and imbecile version of Dr. Frankenstein!",1,9,19,11 July 2016
Casino Royale," Blah !
","This and (2001: A Space Odyssey - 1968) have something in common.So they wanted to rewrite Bond, not only replace an actor instead of another. Unlike some rewriting done with another old hero, and I mean Batman in (Batman Begins) one year earlier, they boldly smashed some of the basics: The lead as an orphan of a poor family grown up to disturbed Oxford boy recruited as hot-blooded reckless and offensive spy / hit-man. He enjoys violence, prefers married women and drinks something else his familiar martini shaken not stirred (too long to memorize). Torturing him was newly cruel; since he was nude, and screaming! We have an evil man who doesn't want to take over the world, an afro-American Felix Leiter, and no Moneypenny, Q, or sci-fi. The climax isn't about beating the evil man in a lair, or stopping a ticking bomb. But who said that every bold deed has to be great?!First off, how come Bond freshly had the 007 rank and dame M is the one whose in charge? This movie deals with the matters before it as if they never happened. Remember (GoldenEye), when they told the very much 007 that the new M is a woman, now how can I believe that he's the new one?! The only answer is: This is a new agent with the same name (so they give them the James Bond rank, then the 007?!). Anyway, I told myself get over it and live the dream. However, it was almost a nightmare; for whoever loves the good old Bond, or else!It's 3 movies. The first is about that raw 007, with 2 good action sequences. The second is one of the most boring movies I have ever been tormented by, with endless poker and endless narration by (Giancarlo Giannini) for all what winded up as unintelligible, ok, I fought the urge to cry to get the whole picture! Let alone the DULLEST evil man in Bond's history; he's a pray more than a beast of prey, living threatened more than threatening, and doing nothing but using the asthma spray and weeping in blood?!! After that, there is a third act where nothing to understand either. Sure insisting on dealing with it, especially in the start and the end, as vol. 1 made it kind of amputated movie, with deliberately obscure events. And it takes itself so seriously; at times, I thought I was watching an existential movie from the 1970s!The first scene is in black and white (To feel that it's a flashback?!). The long chase in the start could fit as a pre-credits hot sequence instead of that cold, short and incomprehensible black and white one. Why to combat the African terrorist; that sounded fabricated to spread some heat in the second act. (Le Chiffre) is one-eyed, and the organization's collector at the end also! While there are no gadgets, Bond runs everything by cell phones (The movie is almost a very long ad about them), which makes a TV show like (Alias) more creative and droll!There is nothing comic about the dialogue, not even one-liner or one double-entendre. The question isn't about how to stand that in a franchise that had been the greatest reference for the one-liners and the first teacher of the double-entendres?! No, it's about how lousy, at anything, this dialogue was. (Charles Manson)'s diary is more romantic than the scenes of Bond and his love. Whoever wrote these scenes is real sick and got nothing to do with love. I'll never forget lines like 'If nothing was left from you except your smile and finger, you'll be more man than any man I have met. / That's because you know what I can do with my finger.' WHAT IN GOD'S NAME IS THAT?!Bond, of (Denial Creag), is stiffer and sillier than (Pierce Brosnan) himself. (Creag) reminded me of Magic (1978), an early (Anthony Hopkins) movie, since he identified with a dummy there with the exact wooden face and blue, always gazing, eyes. Yes, he mastered the action scenes, but this is absolutely his worst role and performance up to that moment. The girls, (Caterina Murino) & (Eva Green), are horrible to say the least. At one scene, (Giannini) tells the second, while she's in a flashy dress: 'Half of the men is still looking at you.' Well, from where I was sitting, I presumed these men were gay! (Eva) is creepily pop-eyed with an unattractive everything. So how about fascinating Bond to the extent of leaving the MI6 for her?!! Needless to say that that love story was forced. Actually in terms of stiff goggle dummies, it was more like (Bride of Chucky)!The cinematic factors were fine, especially the soundtrack which is certainly better than the movie. And the action; cut it out, and you'll have something to watch.For times, the action remains absent. At the old Bonds, the funny spirit, the wicked gadgets, and the beautiful landscapes do compensate. Not this time thought. Although change is good, but not to the worse I believe. Because (Casino Royale) is over serious, no funny, and too boring it's sleepy. It isn't about taking off the dream out of Bond to some extent. It's about how uninteresting that realistic Bond was. So, while it has the intention to be something else the Bond nonsense, it ended up as another nonsense, however less enjoyable!This is not the Bond I love, or Bond I loved. Before watching it, I read everywhere that it is a Masterpiece. Now you should have guessed what's in common between it and (Space Odyssey). Yes, your guess is right!",5,1,6,16 July 2011
Signs," The Other Signs !
","It is the best among M. Night Shyamalan's movies that I watched yet. It wasn't laughably fabricated like (The Village - 2004). It wasn't the real disappointing (Unbreakable - 2000). And most of all, it can be viewed for a second time to savor its high-minded concept unlike his previous, ironically more popular, (The Sixth Sense - 1999).I love it when the genre movie carries a message. So how about a spiritual message as well. (Signs) is about believing in fate, and its genius wisdom, which's beyond the human mind. But it is where the best of it is the meaning of its story, while the worst of it is the way this story was handled. Simply, the mix was uneven.The first half was outstanding on all the levels. The second half looked like a humdrum where the horror wasn't made well, the scene in the basement was dead, and the aliens seemed phony. Yet I was sadder for the dealing with the invasion matter, since I wholly saw it - as the same - before, being Shyamalan's frank and shameless rip-off from H. G. Wells (War of the Worlds). Generally, this second half was sick of laziness. That made it a bit poor and boring.Undoubtedly it is one of the most important roles that Mel Gibson had. And he was the highest element in the movie. Maybe most of the financial success ($227,965,690 gross out of $70,200,000 budget) came from the idea of Gibson's being, and for the first time, in a horror. But there weren't more super elements. Maybe some moments of the direction, the low tone pace, and the astonishing intro music by James Newton Howard; which kind of reminded me of (Psycho - 1960) intro music by Bernard Herrmann, in terms of the running time and the clever horror.Though, I still have faith in (Signs). I believe, this time, Shyamalan wrote this beautiful tale, then made the mystery around, while he concerned, in other movies, about the mystery first. It says a lot about paying more attention to the other signs. The signs of the omnipotent presence of God, and the complicated plans of fate. It is not another movie about the thrill and the horror of evil-creatures-attacking-peaceful-home; it's about that as just a calamity, which we must face and, most significantly, learn from it about higher issues. As if Shyamalan says how pathetic if we thought about signs of aliens, ghosts, superpowers.. etc, and forgot thinking about the signs of God. So this is why it will live longer, being the most valuable among Shyamalan's works and any other Hollywood nonsense.Just look at the lovely last scene. It pushed me to ask why this wasn't made while Jamie Stewart was alive. This kind of tales, concerning returning to faith, was in fashion at the old Hollywood. Here, it only wore new clothes. Thank God that the flaws didn't spoil, totally spoil, what is beneath them.",7,1,3,4 February 2010
Sweet and Lowdown," A story of an artist who dreams of the moon, and fears of riding it !
","It seems like ages since the last time I watched a decent movie by (Woody Allen). Let's see; from Annie Hall (1977) to Everyone Says I Love You (1996) things were good. Then Deconstructing Harry (1997), Small Time Crooks (2000), The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001), Hollywood Ending (2002), and Melinda and Melinda (2004) ALL had problems, sometimes more than their good points. In the middle of both phases is where Sweet and Lowdown exists. Now this is a good movie on all the levels.Why Emmet Ray couldn't be Django Reinhardt? It's simple. He isn't that bold when it comes to express his feelings. So that's why he didn't tell the girl he loved, who loved him as well, that he loves her, and lost her at the end. I think there is a reason why Allen did a movie about that man, else paying a tribute to jazz guitarist he loves. Allen is the complete opposite of Emmet Ray. Dear Woody just can't get enough of showing himself to the audience through the characters of his movies during the last 35 years, some of them played by him. Or maybe, after all of these years, Woody just sees that he didn't express enough, feeling a bound with Ray as if the last is a symbol for the suppression which can kill a talented artist. We can read this movie as a conscience of importunate fear Allen has.Anyway, I loved it. It was fantastic how Allen, out of some unfinished or uncertain stories, made his own version of Emmet Ray's bio. Btw, history itself suffers from having true and false stories! However, I felt something was missing with the background of the character. His history was a bit vague. I knew well that he was poor to the extent that made him afraid of being poor again, so he worked a lot, threw money away for looking rich, having this strange love to steal (he, to some extent, just wants to own). But on the other hand, I didn't understand what the secret of his fear to express was?, was it some kind of compulsory obsession?, was it something in his childhood?, was he that shy of his early poor life?, another unanswered question: He drank much to forget what? His fear, or his inner belief that he wouldn't be great due to this very fear?There are some nice moments. The ones with his wife were so serene, and hilariously comic. Samantha Morton is out of this world, being a tender creature sent from better place to do this role. In that place that she came from, she was gifted with the magical diamond of acting, which made her deliver so realistic and believable performance. Sean Penn proves that he's a master of characters. He did it nearly flawlessly. However, he was lowdown and no sweet! And finally, there is nothing, and I mean nothing, that can be more joyful more than witnessing how the old jazz tracks, that Woody adores, fit perfectly in the movie he directs. Ahhh, I felt deep relief about that apart!(Sweet and Lowdown) is romantic, funny, and sad. And, most importantly, it is where all the elements that make a usual Woody Allen's movie shared to make, at last, a fine Woody Allen's movie. The moon that Ray dreamed of and feared of, Allen captured and rode.",7,2,2,25 May 2010
Identity," Great.. And Almost Good. This is The Real Identity of This Movie !
","I'm aware that my title looks strange, but bear with me to understand that it's not that strange..I'm a screenwriter myself, and let me tell you, it was very amusing to see how it works in my mind like this. I mean all of those characters, with their complicated conflicting attitudes, is the daily life of any author, of movies, plays, short stories, novels.. etc, and by all means, it was so fun to watch these enjoyable breathless conflicts, by those different characters, which came from the same mind, experience, and creation.I loved how all the characters has the same birthday, with names of cities. Or how the mother of the author in the movie / the sick killer is in all the women of his own imagination as part irresponsible selfish (The actress), part good mom but dying (The mother of the kid), part swindler who acts like pregnant so she can force a man to marry her (Clea DuVall as Ginny), and part who's real pregnant and having Aids who committed suicide over a bridge (The memory of Ed), and of course the part of the prostitute who wants a second chance (The romantic prostitute). This is so clever in showing one of the profession's secrets, because this is how the writers work, and in the most simple and funny way too. Also it's how almost all of us put our personalities in so many forms, sometimes more attractive than us (Pruitt Taylor Vince became John Cusack as his pure version) yet with a purgation (Cusack as Ed nearly killed that wife, but he found the serial killer at the end, and died for it). It's the perfect game of that smart composition called 'Drama' where one mind can be the killer, the killed, the officer who finds out the truth, and everybody else, not in that twisted way though, as you may find out the truth about one author from some point in his writings, or by the whole of it.Hence, it's great for any screenwriter. But is it that great as a thriller? I don't think so. And the reasons are clear..Yes, it's such a different plot amongst the deadly threadbare slasher movie plots, thanks to (Michael Cooney). Yes, it's very well acted and directed, sure (James Mangold) did a wonderful job. And yes, it has some nice references for iconic horror movies: The poor motel (Psycho), the Indian graves (The Shining), the multi-personality disorder (Raising Cain). But, it was that predictable. Because anyone in their right mind would ask logically what was the connection between what we were seeing in that creepy motel, and that late trial of the psychopath serial killer who had - as the movie itself brought up in its middle - a multi-personality disorder! That was a perfect hint in the perfect wrong place, especially with a character of a mysterious silent child, and a lot of history about the character early in the opening credit; surely we've learned from the best, I mean all the previous mysteries of the American cinema! Moreover, that hasty technique to present the twist as a premature climax; that wasn't talented at all to a dangerous extent. Because no one in the world would be connected with the story of the motel's alleged slasher anymore, as we all knew the real truth already. In fact, all the 20 minutes sequence in the end was un-thrilling, and the they could find so many solutions to make that more hot as they have done before in so many movies of which I can't tell about without so many spoiler alerts!So the disappointment was large with that subversive way of writing the third act, and that kind of fabricated finale too with the killer going loose as if we will see (Identity 2: It's Not In My Mind!). It was just some kind of any exciting end to compensate the wasted suspense of that inadequate climax...Knew now what I meant by 'Great.. And Almost Good'?!P.S: I got sick of the way the name of God is treated in Hollywood movies, and this one - in specific - has one of the ugliest profanities I have ever heard. It's as if the idea of 'holy' is dead, and there is a marathon of calling it names as well!",Null,2,4,12 December 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Less Magic !
","I'm a big fan of (Die Hard). The first 3 movies are about great action, and they all deliver. This late sequel is nice. But in the same time, it has to be not the worst, let's say the least interesting one in the series. So why is that?While the plot is smart when it deals with the computer's stuff, the digital disaster, etc. it isn't the same with the rest. It managed to give us action all the way, but not with much of surprises or twists. The previous movies raised the bar so much that this one seems lower in comparison. The character of the hacker wasn't funny or catchy. I didn't know what was the evil guy's agenda when he showed the image of distorted Capitol? Or how the computer's Warlock knew all of these government's secrets? And the whole sequence of the plane was absurd, not even good absurd.The action is well-made yet without the same attractiveness of the past 3 movies. (Len Wiseman) executes more than creates. I didn't feel any personal touch or special appeal. Save smashing a flying helicopter with a speeding car, I don't recall one sequence that I want to see again. And there wasn't any striking fistfight (one of the series' trademarks). The image's quality has nothing to do with (Die Hard)'s legacy. It's, at best, close to what any high TV show achieves, being like a '24' episode for most of the time. For instance, the gunfire sequence in the hacker's flat was so TV-ish (aka: poor!).The soundtrack: OH MY GOD! Die Hard movies always had remarkable soundtracks. This time, surely it missed a sign of singularity, to be as any other action in the market. It's the first one without the music of (Michael Kamen) who died in 2003. And they got the nerve to hoax us with Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy' but only in the trailer!The dialogue. My comment is: Grrrrr! This is the worst dialogue ever written for John MacLean EVER EVER EVER. It could be the movie's first defect and main crime. I can assure you; some of my friends watch these movies for MacLean's unforgettably sarcastic remarks. This time, it's official: the cat ate his tongue! I imagined that the old, more lonely, MacLean got to be more sarcastic. But the fun was dry. So dry. The rest wasn't better either: 'On your tombstone, it will say always in the wrong place at the wrong time/ No, I'll write Yippie-ki-yay..'?? It seems like someone writes out the past movies' taglines!As for the evil guys, the mastermind was cool and young, but uncharismatic and un-mysterious. Just one look at him and you'll know that (Bruce Willis) will finish him and so easily as well! His henchmen, the acrobats, were kind of new, but totally not memorable, or that menacing.The CGI shook the cornerstone of these movies as old-fashioned action. For me, I pray for one big fine action without it at all. Hence, I promised myself that this movie would be the one. I was wrong! True that the CGI wasn't so much or flamboyant. But it was bad and cheesy. Let alone seeing it in a (Die Hard) movie in the first place!The climax was disappointing; being short and unsatisfying, fitting more for a TV episode's end. Plus, I couldn't understand why the evil guy didn't kill John or his daughter while he was having them?! I know, it's one of the cinema's most unquestionable, and unanswered, questions. But here it was just that provocative and weak!It takes place in more than a day too. This is something which, out of all the people of the world, bothers me the most!It's the usual (Die Hard) movie, while these movies are anything but usual. It had good success, simply because it was launched among 2007's many less strong blockbusters (Pirates of The Caribbean: At World's End), (Spider-Man 3), and (Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer). Anyway it's, as it is, still one of the best movies (Willis) has made in years.Finally, a lot of viewers hated, just hated, that this is the most *family* Die Hard movie without the ultra cursing or violence, feeling something deficient especially when the lead didn't complete his: 'Yippie-ki-yay..'. But while I didn't care about that at all, I felt something was deficient. And when it comes to the movie's magic; IT IS really deficient!",6,0,2,9 November 2009
RED," Red.. in The Face !
","You know what's the worst thing about this movie? It's the movie itself!This is shockingly not up to its potentials. I love these stars (They chose them all top class), this formula (Old seven samurai; WAW!), but the outcome can't be more disappointing.The script is a confused little summary of never happened great action. There are many missing links. You'll ask, for all the first 2 thirds, what's the story of the murdered reporters that they're yapping about? Hiding its facts for all that time wasn't for the sake of any thrill. We didn't even get to see their killings (???), why (Willis) got to hit (Karl Urban), the harsh CIA operative tasked in finding the leads, right in his CIA office? So he would never do that again! How (Freeman) knew the place of (Malkovich) and (Willis) after he got away from his killer?? (Urban) got astonished that the CIA had archives for its agents (huh?!). (Urban) turned into the opposite and killed his boss at the end; if that was for being afraid of (Willis)'s threat to his family, then it's so predictable, and if it was his political faith got changed in the nick of time; then you'll never know why! And seriously what kind of movie that doesn't show us the real evil man until the last 10 minutes? (to do absolutely nothing either!). I know. It's a weak movie, with tepid conflict. So I watched some people getting shot at, doing some things, fighting unseen enemy, for reasons that we hardly understand!The characters define trivial. For instance, the leads; what's particular about them in the first place? In a movie named (The Chronicles of Riddick) the lead, (Van Diesel), kills a man with a cup of tea. This time, don't wait for something like this or remotely similar. Because while the movie brags of its so-called legendary team, I wasn't pushed to rise an eyebrow during the whole time, not saying for once: 'How they did this?!'. We have only 3 sequences of action (the one in the start, the fight at the CIA, and the kidnapping at last) with zero super intelligent or 'Extremely Dangerous' stuff. Remember how (Morgan Freeman) dies?! It was provocatively easy. It makes you wonder; so that's how these high profile agents act?!!The dialogue has no touchy or funny line. Not to mention being very idiot. Contemplate a moment like when (Brian Cox) is talking to (Willis) after the kidnapping of the last's girl. He says things about how crazy we become when we're in love, and recalls how his own love, (Helen Mirren), shot him in the chest once. Accordingly, what's the connection between the 2 situations for God's sake?!! Does he mean that she was crazy in love with her country?! Or does he refer to (Willis) to shot his own girlfriend in the chest??!! In earlier moment, after the kidnapping itself, the supposedly wicked line that ends the scene, concerning the reuniting of the flame between this Russian man and that English lady, is said by (Willis)?? How to smile, and crack jokes, right after your love was grabbed and disappeared??? The character played by Malkovich, standing in the same scene, is the one who should have said that! And it's unbelievable already, when every character says: 'unbelievable' every now and then!(Bruce Willis) looks more like a robot. He turned from cool into cold, reusing ALL of his reactions from his old movies again and again yet so carelessly. Sometimes I noticed that he gives the wrong reactions for the scene! He delivers what we can name as the sleepwalking version of (John McClane), or his most (Charles Bronson) performance ever. Enough to say that watching him was soooooo boring, instead of fun. Over and above; he plays a role that I highly doubt that it was written for older actor; say (Clint Eastwood), (Robert De Niro), or (Harrison Ford). Did you notice remarks like 'he retired because he got old', or 'grandpa'?!This movie adds nothing to (John Malkovich), and he adds nothing to it either. HE DID IT FOR THE MONEYYYYYYY, yes, but at least it could have been entertaining along the way. His character has to be the comic relief, the nut, or let's say the older copy of The A-Team's (H.M. Murdock). However, he was useless. It was pathetic to follow a fine talent like him doing that poorly written material.And please, (Mary Louise Parker) deserves a Razzie, a BIG one. She has no charisma, no acting talent, no comic ability, being very annoying and silly. Maybe in another movie she would be less worse, but HERE, she got to have the WORST no less!The survivors: (Brian Cox). Aside from being great actor apart, the 'feelings', that his character won, made him human, consequently memorable. Somehow you can say that again about the 93-year-old (Ernest Borgnine) in his cameo as the X-files keeper, which evoked the old real men-on-a-mission movies such as (The Dirty Dozen) and (The Wild Bunch). Watch how (Willis) regards him, in real passion, at one scene. Although the few action sequences weren't that great, occupying just 10 % of the movie, but thank God for them, otherwise it would have been completely unwatchable!Apparently the script did interesting first 10 minutes and last 10 minutes, while making a long dull second act in between. And, as a whole, it's deprived of anything new or creative. Why, in Hollywood nowadays, they give time for everything except the script? That's a deadly sin that this movie suffers from, and dies due to it!The conclusion: one of the worst of its kind. And compared to its list of stars, embarrassing too. In a word; the trailer is way better!",3,0,5,10 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," With All Due Respect, This is Not a Great Movie !
","The important points about this movie are very..The first of the ones around it; is that overwhelming success. It was incredible to see how the audience declared 'war' over the entire hippie, realistic, experimental American cinema, whatever the name of the problem was, which prevailed since the end of the 1960s. And they celebrated a real glossy and entertaining another one. Apparently, this movie returned the word commercial to movies, being Hollywood's perfect revenge out of TV, previous expensive 'not hit' movies, or the else illnesses, and the birth of the modern blockbuster as we know right now.Additionally, I think that (Star Wars) gave the movies such a fundamental influence; which was pushing powerfully the teenagers as the cinematic heroes, and sci-fi to the commercial rank. Yes, Disney movies used the teenager heroes before, but on a short-range and not with a gigantic prosperity, and sci-fi was there, yet artistically. So (Star Wars) paved the way to venturesome leads, who range between 10 and 18 year old, in next sci-fi, or fantasy for that matter, hits. Recall: E.T., The Goonies, Back to the Future.. etc, which defined the ages of the moviegoers for years to come, and manifested that fantastic cinema could be popular and profitable.Then, the important points 'in' it. For one is the combination of the script. It's smart to gather factors of the western legacy, the old world's legends and the sci-fi space adventures. And it clicked. I loved the most that team of: strong mystic knight (Obi-Wan Kenobi), reckless bounty hunter (Han Solo), willful Princess (Leia), heroic immature farmer (Luke Skywalker), English - so devoted - butler (C-3PO), and clever little robot (R2-D2); instead of the mythical animals of the ancient legends. And not to forget the metallic Commander, and magical evil guy (Darth Vader). That selecting of soul, mind, and heart vs. viciousness, coldness, and inhumanity was so creative despite how using them wasn't mostly as creative.And, these special effects. I believe that was a milestone at its time. The next stops will be (Terminator 2: Judgment Day - 1991) and (The Matrix - 1999).Let alone that music score. (John Williams) is the one who can make the symphonies so marketable. What I love about him is his understanding when it comes to expressing many themes so passionately. And the way how he gave that plain tale a profound shadows and enthusiastic spirit. He can turn any light cartoon into a Shakespearean epic, with load of credibility and likability. Without his music, this movie could have lost good deal of its personality and prestige.Away from all of those points, the script wasn't that competent, which is something to be assured of with the next, not written by (George Lucas), sequel. And to hold by your own hands with the next, wholly doomed, wholly written by Lucas, 3 prequels! In this movie, I don't remember a twist or surprise. The thrill wasn't that super. The characters were so comics; namely funny and naive. And I hated points like, for instance, how (Chewbacca) was so unnecessary, rather unused!I watched it more than once, and I can't deny the feel of bore in some places. For one reason, the dialogue is so-deeply-insightful-it's-uninteresting, seeming so geeky and no entertaining. It's things to be written but not to be said; exactly as (Carrie Fisher) referred to (Lucas) once. And for another, the direction was ordinary; many scenes were tepid and humdrum.The action sequences weren't the best. The long climactic sequence, of exploding the death star, was yes kind of new image, but surely artificial, monotonous, and lacking any high suspense. Although the lightsabers idea was impressive, but the swordplay wasn't. Generally, the movie relayed more on the cool look more than the smart directing.Unlike many of the movie's attackers, I didn't hate the acting. It was suitable and fresh. The thing is that script didn't endow these actors with many characteristics, or hard situations to make them enjoyably watchable and deeply effective. (Alec Guinness), (James Earl Jones) and (Harrison Ford) were the winners. (Ford) in particular stole the show. Aside from his wit, the lovable cowboy was absent for years. And simply his character was the more human; the type that will be nonexistent in the prequels. On the other hand, (Mark Hamill) and (Carrie Fisher) lacked charisma, and (Peter Cushing) was wasted to the degree of being unnoticed.The 'New Hope' matter was a new nonsense! I don't know how (Lucas) did that in cold blood? But clearly he did it only for himself. Otherwise, it's a practical lesson in how to toy with an old movie to change and alter, how to irritate viewers by some useless CGI, and how to destroy the history since it makes you totally out of the mood and distracted between the original 1970s's quality and the 1990s's one!The sequel is way better. Mainly because (Lucas) was out of the writing and the directing. These previous defects, that I mentioned, would be doubled in the next trilogy of prequels; where the script would go down, the action would be so missed, the direction would be downright tedious, the CGI would hugely and provocatively rule as if it's the point, and the acting - sorrowfully - would hit the rock bottom also!Nostalgia got a big hand in the top rank which (Star War) achieved. No doubt, the viewers of the late 1970s were so thirsty for that substitute dazzlingly-made world, being extremely fed up of countless anti-heroes, needing desperately a portion of sheer noble adventures or good American values. Not the ('Dirty' Harry), not the 'British' (James Bond). So they got all the reasons to adore this movie. It looked different and desired for them, unlike someone who watched it in 1998. Because deep down inside, (Star Wars) is averagely entertaining time. And despite my admitting that it has great effects, it is not a great movie in my book.",7,3,7,3 April 2010
Thirteen Days," These 1962 events acquire special significance in 2000 !
","It's impossible not to relate between the date of the film's events, and the date of its production. The crises of the Russian missiles of 1962 and Kennedy's caution towards the idea of declaring a war against Cuba come to assure the smartness of the late leader, and expose - at the same time - the stupidity of other living leaders!The spread lines, here and there in the film, about striking a little nation and turning it back to the Stone Age as something the people of that nation, along with the Americans themselves, don't deserve at all is not a matter far from any other American war on other little nations. The link is more than tangible. See how it prognosticates, or reads well, the American war on Iraq with the last line of 'Let's broaden our influence in the middle east.', said by one of the white house's wicked exacts, particularly after the peaceful termination that the Cuban-American situation ended up to.Choosing (Roger Donaldson) to take over the director's chair was a bit disappointing, maybe for him and sure for us. Because he's that clever pure action thriller director (No Way Out, The Getaway, Dante's Peak, The Recruit) he was out of his area for nearly all the time. Save the moment of shooting the missiles by fast planes, which was done astonishingly, (Donaldson) was manacled by endless conversations in closed rooms. I think he got board in a way that got to us as well.(Donaldson) couldn't handle the script the smart way it did with the thrill. There is a cold sense all over it. Most of the scenes is TV-ish with executive mark; standing men, talking in the oval office. Resorting to black and white image sometimes didn't give it any deepness or singularity. Add to that, not going into anyone's life or background else the president's consultant; played by the film's star and producer Kevin Costner.Using stock footage, from old documentaries or films, that show the Marines getting ready for war wasn't for the film's sake. The quality of their image contradicted highly with the so modern quality of the film's image. Therefore they looked so inharmonic, unlike the intended.Strangely, the 44-year-old Bruce Greenwood looked older than the 45-year-old John F. Kennedy, and uglier. Poor Greenwood was also eaten by the presence of Costner and the character that was given to him; despite how many historical sources state that Kenny O'Donnell had no role in the crisis, and that it was, in fact, Ted Sorensen who pulled the administration together.A producer proves that he or she is distinct and bold by being enthusiastic for the different thing. Costner produced Dances with Wolves (1990) with a story about the old west, acted in Red Indian language, and ran for 3 hours, when it was usual to refuse only the first part! Knowing the nature of (Thirteen Days), being anything like the epical, flashy and meant to entertain other films he produced, such as Wyatt Earp (1994), Waterworld (1995), and The Postman (1997), you have to respect the mission he undertook to make a project like this see the light. This time, he gives quite a testimony about an American leader's wisdom and leaning to piece, once. Let alone that testimony's impeccable timing. OK, Costner is not only distinct and bold, he also has a conscience. That's something rare to find in a producer in Hollywood!Couple of years before this film, precisely on October 31, 1998, Bill Clinton signed a law which instituted a policy of 'regime change' against Iraq. Although it explicitly stated that it did not speak to the use of American military forces, Clinton launched a four-day bombing campaign, lasting from December 16 to December 19, 1998. The rest can be watched through George W. Bush's presidency, when Iraq was invaded for false accusations of owning nuclear arms. So if Clinton, Bush, or Obama didn't make themselves, and the world, a favor by watching and understanding the film that took place in their presidential house, then let me hope that next presidents would. However, obviously lately, stupidity, greed, or simply the arms dealers, don't want any similar critical situation to end in just 13 days. Enough to say that the one who managed to do it, John Kennedy, was killed in the next year, ironically after 13 months of the crises' start!All the American propaganda films is about 'let's war', and 'how we're good at it'. This one is about 'let's not war', and 'how we can do it good', making rare propaganda for rationality over madness. It is a good film about giant event. Despite being a bit cinematically pale, its strength comes from its well-made sensitive drama. And its uniqueness comes from being the history lesson that nearly nobody wanted, or wants, to listen to.",Null,0,1,16 November 2011
The Thin Red Line," What is The Thin Red Line ?!
","I'm sick of all of this celebration for a bad film which imagines how great it is, and more than this, you also have some fools who had no brain, no culture, and no conscience, thinking that this movie or its likes is: Beautiful, Superb, Emotive, Staggering, Genius, Influential, Unique, Moving, Extraordinary, Epic, Masterpiece, and Perfect Poem! OH GOD, please forgive them all, they do not know what they are saying. To all of them: Being different doesn't necessarily mean being great. NO, sometimes - like this time - it's only different!Mr. Malick thought that he was making a great anti-war film about repression, torture, and doom of the human being who's killed by the very hands of the human or himself. Yes, yes, we got it. But you know what? We got it very well done in other movies, which didn't have any allegation, any false greatness. And I want to say something, No.. scream my head off TO ALL THE FILMMAKERS: If you want to make a great work, and want it to be immortal, so please HAVE THE AUDIENCE first. Not to be that high in the sky, down to earth a little. Because if you became that high, making no enjoyable work in the same time, nobody would care. Nobody would bother to understand what in the world you were saying!!I know, you must be different, and make whatever you want, as a writer and director, especially when you plan to make something not like any of the usual war films, but an anti-propaganda kind of work. However, it turned out to be a film which was too boring to fallow, too scrappy to present a DRAMA that could affect you or lead your emotion, therefore in more than 1000 comments you'll never find the warning 'This comment may contain spoilers' at all, so ask yourself why!Further than that, when you have all of those stars to do little things or to do nothing at all (Remember George Clooney!!), then surely your viewer will feel disappointed and deceived. Actually the trauma is bigger when you know how this movie was the only creation of its director after 20 years of isolation, so he came back to explain the human behavior by concepts which are so close to Manichean, but anyway.. who am I to tell MR. Malick, or any other artist, what to make?! I'm just the poor man, the humble viewer who watch this, and say that it's a real pure absolute nonsense, which was nominated for 7 Oscars to get nothing, and it's one of a very very few times that I find myself shouting 'Long Live The Academy!!'.For being objective, I loved Nick Nolte's character and performance. That's it.At last, I have 2 flaming questions: What is the meaning of 'The Thin Red Line' anyway?! Because our dear FILM didn't give us any guide or whatsoever to understand the title. And just why is that EXACTLY?! That's my second flaming question!",1,6,11,4 August 2007
Click," The reasons why I wasn't satisfied after its end !
","It seemed like a movie from the 1960s and the 1970s, especially Disney's (The Absent-Minded Professor - 1961) or (The Million Dollar Duck - 1971) where a middle-class guy has something miraculous in his life, that meets the third act of Frank Capra's (It's a Wonderful Life - 1946). Misusing the miraculous power through a 'What I!f' movie can create a good fantasy with a message. But while (Click) has an interesting idea for sure, the treatment wasn't as interesting.After spending nearly the half of it, with sketches that showcased the remote control's abilities and (Sandler)'s delightful joking, the script immersed in loud melodrama, that called for Indian remake!, and got caught in the trap of being dryly forthrightly preachy; where the whole meaning was said easily 'Family comes first'! In fact, the entire second part lacked the humor and the imagination of the first one.Then, slight matters bothered me. For instance: Who was that mad inventor?! I hate it when they finish writing a movie, then get too sloppy to answer questions of that sort, even though it would have been more solid fantasy if they ever did! He simply looked like the direct voice of the writer intervening himself in, without any efforts to make it 'really' magical. A considerable point like 'You were accelerating your life before I give you the remote' wasn't portrayed at all. The rude comedy; concerning excrement, farts, butts jokes,.. etc, went forever. This time, I deemed it an insult from the writers to themselves; because according to what I have seen of some smartness along the way, they could have done better and classier. I thought that the futuristic details - while being not too many - weren't that necessary, since the movie isn't designed to be a dazzling sci-fi blockbuster, it was close to block the movie's main text. And finally, the matter of the kids' bicycles was SO WEAK, no way that architect couldn't afford their cost!Director (Frank Coraci) handled it nice and simple. But I don't think that it deserved being nominated for the Oscar of the best makeup; it wasn't that special. For me, the makeup of (Henry Winkler) as a young man was so-freaky-it's-comic. Apparently, that year, the academy didn't find more significant efforts to honor!On the other hand, (Sandler) delivers in his second phase as a suburb father, after his well known first phase as nothing but A-one idiot! (Christopher Walken) was so perfectly cast, I though that he - at some points - was spoofing his own persona, as same as (James Earl Jones); who would redo it, right in the same year, in (Scary Movie 4). Moreover, it's my first time ever to call (David Hasselhoff) great in anything; he nailed that funny character so much to the extent that I was waiting for his scenes. True that (Kate Beckinsale) was kind of cold in the first half, but she improved in the second. And the soundtrack was nostalgic; in these days, it is a recipe for success to guys like me!At any rate, it's still one different idea among the American cinema's flood of remakes, sequels, prequels lately, a good movie for (Sandler).. finally, and a well meaning comedy with an advice to say. Too bad that that very advice was said a bit poorly unlike the basic, very rich, idea.",6,1,2,26 September 2010
Pineapple Express," I didn't laugh. Instead, I was sad, grossed-out and scared !
","This is Hollywood filth made under the name of comedy and action. It's mainly a buddy movie. It has the extremely predictable plot: 'Someone witnessed accidentally a murder, so let's chase him, and his buddy, to kill them both', while carrying out the known by heart themes: From zeroes to heroes, from haters to lovers,.. you know.. the usual. However, it's done this round with 2 stoned guys. The result is fast-paced, explosive, totally unfunny garbage!Save the opening credits sequence, that presented (Rogan)'s character and life, it was like the desert of writing, as it was all empty and dry. There is nothing remotely droll about the characters. Take for instance the evil men teams. They are evil, end of the story! When the script, any script, thinks that being sheer stupid will be funny, then it may be stupid itself. And by watching the leads of this movie, how they talk and deal, then IT IS stupid!The dialogue consists of things which you can easily find in any bathroom's bowl right after using it. Writing those shoddy lines isn't a talented thing to do. The sexual references were many and ugly. The girlfriend says nothing but the F word. They overused the bad language to a degree where I was board to death. You have to be artistic when it comes to dealing with characters like stoned people. Otherwise, hanging with them would be more merciful. As you see, Hollywood writers have become worse than the stoned people!(James Franco) is the last comedian on earth. He CAN'T make laughs. I don't know how to cast him in a comedy in the first place. He was torturous. (Danny McBride) was even more torturous. That guy oozes awfulness. He has anti-charisma that can turn you off for good. And it's not complete without the worst in history (Kevin Corrigan). OH MY GOD, here's someone who has nothing to do with comedy, or acting, or anything but provoking you!I couldn't stand this amount of blood and gore, as if whatever they missed in comedy, they compensated by exploding foots, shooting bellies, cutting off ears; they did that last one and elongated it for what exactly?!Nastiness for nastiness is essential in here. Recall the weird scene of selling weeds to very young teens?? I bet the movie's makers wanted to win more young audience by manipulating what's shown as their 'forbidden dream'. Therefore, at that point, I came to believe that the movie is a nasty drug itself! And that last scene; it's about friendship and unity and new beginnings (cancel the last one for the sequel!), but while it's played as serene moment, it was absolute gross and fake. It fits being the best end for the worst movie.By the way, it wanted to be satirical as well. Yeah. Can you believe it?! By the intro scene, and the matter of someone from the police as a drug dealer, this movie points fingers at the authority as a beneficiary out of the youths, like the movie's leads, when they immerse in drugs. Bravo. However, the intro scene was bland, unutilized well, and hence ended up as unnecessary. The matter of the policewoman is usual; rather a worn-out habit in the American cinema during the last decades. And the crime of 'getting benefits out of the youths by immersing them in drugs' can apply to the movie's producers also!Still, there is the rock bottom. A line, said by (Franco), about how amazing the Pineapple Express weed is. To be honest, it was one of the most shocking moments in my life. The blasphemy wasn't more horrific like that before. It's so sinful; I can't accept that in the name of art (art? here?!), or else. Now my question isn't about how it has become frequent to find hideousness like that in Hollywood movies lately, as it turned into bizarrely natural, my question is about: how they didn't find any other line to make laugh except THIS??!(Pineapple Express) isn't another bankrupt comedy only, but freely brutal and horrifically impudent also. The thing is nobody warned me earlier. I just heard that it made big money in America; which is something you have to be so alarmed by it lately. Obviously, the American viewers nowadays need non-stop blood, cursing and blasphemy. When Hollywood producers make a movie such as this, then it's understandable; they woo cheaply the dirtiest human lusts to make money. But when that same movie hit it high, then sure something is really wrong with the mentality of great deal of the American youth; or simply the demographic audience which goods of that sort are produced to.I was sad and grossed-out while watching. The B movie, especially the buddy comedy, used to be something less tacky and no sickening. Now, we have pure garbage as entertainment? In fact, dumps are cleaner than this. So as a movie, to the toilet of my memories. But as a successful direct current, it's a sign of danger, and a reason to be scared.",1,1,6,22 June 2011
Sin City," Stylized Rubbish !
","Movies aren't supposed to be the same thing (s), and some artists can be slightly or largely crazy. So why did I abominate this somehow different movie, done by 3 crazy artists?!Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino and Frank Miller are 3 maniacs. They work loyally in the movies to cure themselves, or to show the poor us their ultimate helpless madness (or to make us that mad!). Anyway, 9 years earlier, (From Dusk till Dawn) was one of Tarantino-Rodriguez's movies which failed at mixing the genre with any probable satire. Therefore, this time, Rodriguez, Tarantino and Miller determined to make it pure violence, pure style!It's the modern noir, the graphic novels at a new high visual level, however with mere technique, brainless core, shocking violence, nudity, and sickening images that can kill me while watching (the final story with the freak creature for small instance!). So it's a disturbing time, sold as fun movie!Over and above, the selected stories are very sleazy. Don't try to evaluate any performance, the style invaded all, and with stories like that, forget all about it. It was stupid joke when they put the character of one man who represents the political authority, and how he's evil; it makes me laugh as if this movie has a possible message or something! And I didn't like the CGI; I'm an old-fashioned guy, I hated seeing the CG soldiers in (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace - 1999), while Stanley Kubrick said about 8 thousand extras for (Spartacus - 1960)'s battles: 'This Is Not Enough'!(Sin City) is considered a victory for the graphic novel movie, and the CGI, but for me, it's eerie obscene monster. While style is a good way to achieve a message, it was too much this time, and even its message of entertainment aimed at nothing but rubbish. You can call it one step for humanity, and for animality too.",1,0,3,5 August 2008
The Wedding Singer," Rom-com with a view to the 1980s (and maybe a point of view about it !)
","It's nothing but age-old known-by-heart romantic comedy. But with so many references to the 1980s, as a love for that decade more than a mockery at it.During all of its time, there is a certain loyalty to pay this decade the biggest homage. I liked the wicked intimations to the 'perfect marriages' of the era's celebrities; that was well-done. Yet, I liked the most this intensive desire to capture the 1980s vivid colors of the backgrounds, sets and the image's details as a whole.It makes you ask the question: Did the 1980s become dated, especially after 8 years of its end? I don't think so. It just seems more innocent, gay, stylish, and perhaps more romantic. That's nostalgic enough. So what the movie makers did was picking out some of the decade's most outrageous particulars (Michael Jackson's glove.. Please!) to make something like a nice party, to honor and savor those years, under a sign of: 'The 1980s.. We Love You'.But despite how it succeeded at that matter to great extent, could that be the reason why this movie was made, or was it just a way to cover the ancient brand of the story? Hmmm.. I lean to the second guess, as you would notice that these nonstop references were better than the script itself which was so formulaic (read: lazy) at parts. Actually some of the situations were pretty timeworn and cheesy. One like the kiss's rehearsal was exceedingly forced. The end is a little bit fabricated. And the dialogue reaches its best only while spoofing the 1980s.By the way, the desire of capturing the 1980s vivid colors wasn't accurate all along, since the 1980s' movies were bright but not heavy, and flashy but not meretricious. For instance, the wall's tints here looked incompatible and badly intense sometimes.Anyway, the supporting cast is amazing. The soundtrack is excellent, if you're one of the 1980s freaks like me or not. (Sandler) did it fine, I'm crazy about his 'Somebody Kill Me, Please' song. And, on a deep level, the movie manages - even unintentionally - to dispatch a message about the 1980s as if it was the perfect age for naive love stories like that, and feel good movies like this.It's enjoyable mediocre romantic comedy, ultra-enjoyable and above-mediocre when it comes to the 1980s, and it's the joy itself when we're talking about one of the most talented, and cute girls ever appeared on the screen: (Drew Barrymore).",Null,1,1,5 May 2009
The Bourne Supremacy," The Bourne Exploitation !
","I loved part one, as an action movie that tries greatly to be more than action movie. But here, you'll smell the stench of the commercial exploitation.Firstly, the smart intellectual shadows of part one isn't here. This is openly the usual Bourne adventure. And although the rim looks really hot, but everything in it was whether traditional or hollow.Secondly, they put some kind of supernatural halo above Bourne's character. Clearly he isn't Bond nor Superman, but while watching him through the final car chase, he seemed invincibly steely with many cars clash his seat and he survives totally unhurt; which took away some of the sweet humanity that distinguishes such a hero, despite his noble choice at its end.Thirdly, the plot's nature; it's weak, with flimsy excuses: Bourne made his girl sit instead of him as the driver just to get killed! Contradiction: why the need to frame Bourne while he has been killed in India first?! Idiotic motives: why to remember Bourne after whole 2 years of his situation already?! Unexplained matters: among all the intelligence experts, no one pays attention to the irony of a professional highly trained spy, from the weighty Treadstone project, leaving an obvious fingerprint that leads directly to him?!, except just one, who gets killed shortly after then nobody discovers his murder, or ever asks about him later?!!, and the idea of the hunting sniper is reformed, read: repeated, from the first movie, let alone how all the complicated events came to an end too easily: (Cox)'s character faces Bourne weakly, then committed suicide and in front of the one who'll going to solve everything in a happy end?? But at least there wasn't the Hollywood usual: a forced sex scene, a comic relief, or compulsory heroine.Director (Paul Greengrass) tracks down well the method originated by (Doug Liman) in the first Bourne movie. He makes the movie as technically clever, attractive, and so intensive. (Greengrass) gave the image such a brilliant sense of reality, making the whole thing like a coarse live broadcast from a disaster area, while keeping sane and tense in the same time whatever the national street was. And remember, this is the movie where all the action takes place in actual streets, and there is no CGI involved at all. That deserves a WAW from my side!So, with unique cinematography, smart editing, and wild music orchestra, all the movements seems fast yet strict, not as a video game or comics, but as a movie with dissimilar artistic personality. How (Greengrass) draws with light green on (Matt Damon)'s face, makes him pale as a ghost, leads him like an innocent man in a crazy jungle; it's another story else nearly all what we watch of other American action movies. But unlike (The Bourne Identity), (Supremacy) has just the action. It's entertaining movie, however somehow forgettable comparing to its sure surpassing original.Despite the ultimate efforts of (Damon), he's still a shortcoming like he was, partly, in (The Bourne Identity). Looking cold, boyish.. Well you name it. True that he hits the 9 out of 10 here, though for me his 9 is more like 6 as an action hero or charismatic lead. Sorry (Matt), nothing personal.I believe the previous (Bourne) movie was a masterpiece, this one assures that in a bad way. From one viewpoint, the tagline 'They Should Have Left Him Alone' can be used as a reference about the first movie as well!",Null,0,2,20 February 2009
The Proposal," Again and again and again and - why not - again !
","OK, it's a conventional Hollywood romantic comedy. Namely: something has been done endless times before, and will be done endless times after. Although the skeleton is one, the flesh and blood are many and different, or - for the sake of satisfied viewers - supposed to be. Let's see how this movie was doing in terms of that matter.The couple is working in the publishing business. She is the tough boss of he. He is loaded with money, but just doesn't say. The family of he lives in Alaska. Then, some sprinkles, like: an eagle kidnapping a puppy, a baby maker blanket, Sandra Bullock's rap, and yes.. a male stripper!On the other hand, there are tons of the genre's worn-out antiques: the from haters to lovers, from fake love to actual love, and the opposites attract themes and sketches. The character that blows up the scheme of the fake lovers, hence a problem with the newly born 'actual' love. A confession in front of the whole jury, hence a bigger problem that - naturally - leads to some kind of conciliation. Then the 'running', which always distinguishes these movies, where he or she runs for the other, to catch her or him in the nick of time. Well, you know the drill, you experienced the routine, AND THIS MOVIE TOO!Despite the general mildness, the few 'new' touches were few and touches. Some of them bothered my stomach, and I do mean the male stripper scene, then knowing that he is the town's minister as well (How innovating? No, How repulsive!). Moreover, the many 'old' clichés were many and old. At the moment of 'Whoops, we ran into each other so accidentally while being both undressed' I was real sick. I saw that so-called coincidence at least 100 times before in Hollywood romantic comedies, produced in the last 10 years only!All the storylines that concern Ryan Reynolds's character, ex-fiancée, father, wasn't utilized, or even made, well. Watching material like swallowing an appetizer suddenly, a fabricated ring story.. etc. proved to be repeated and unfunny. In fact, the comedy was ranging between not being made creatively, or not being made! The movie was deadly predictable; for instance, I saw the whole third act, scene by scene, coming from a million miles away. And if it was predictable from the start, then the script didn't make it 'that enjoyable' along the way too. Here's a movie that thinks that it makes new stuff and big laughs merely by seeing a Hispanic male stripper that works as a minister!There is a 13 years gab between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. That wasn't for the sake of her by any chance. She - for the very first time in her career - looked old in front of her rom-com's co-star. Reynolds is talented, but seemed a bit stiff for most of the time.The most lovely and energetic old actress today, Betty White, is the movie's main dish. She stole the show, albeit it wasn't originally that hard to be stolen. There was a chuckle here, and other there, all in the first third, which heavily disappoints for the rest of the movie. Hmmm, what else could be good?! Yeah, Sandra Bullock, despite doing almost the same again and again. Her 'favorite things' thawing monologue was perfectly written and acted. I myself like Brian Dennehy as well!Along the way, (The Proposal) pushed me to remind numerous other movies: (Green Card - 1990), (The Devil Wears Prada - 2006), (Something's Gotta Give - 2003), (When Harry Met Sally - 1989), even violent action like (Wanted - 2008) with suppressed employee who bursts in his female boss's face, and (When You Were Sleeping - 1995) starring Bullock herself. Maybe before writing this, Peter Chiarelli (mainly a producer who turned here into first time screenwriter) watched many romantic comedies to make somehow a mix out of them. But the outcome turned out to be something easy to write, easy to watch, and easy to forget. WAW, that has become a sign of Hollywood's movies lately!I read that tissues are recycled from old papers. (The Proposal) is a tissue, smooth and light. But still a used-for-once tissue. And its original 'papers' are better and more original. I don't mind doing the same stories again and again and again. The thing is.. again isn't always a gain!4 out of 10. Sorry, but the 'Whoops, we ran into each other so accidentally while being both undressed' moment was too unbearable. It's more predictable and boring than seeing Friday the 13th getting killed in the end of every Friday the 13th movie!",4,0,1,5 June 2012
Jurassic Park," The 'O' Word !
","I remember well that I was craving to see (Jurassic Park) right after its release. For one reason, (Steven Spielberg) is interesting to watch; at that time I was about completing all what he did of movies up to that moment. And for another reason, the movie hit high and became the most successful movie ever, reaching to the unthinkable number: 900 Million Dollar. (Titanic) would ascend the throne later, achieving 100 million more, but not before 4 years. So, I went to watch it.. and what a disappointment!Yes, the idea is wild, the action is good, and the performance is fair, BUT that's, from my point of view, isn't my idea of the movie that millions must watch, love, and remember greatly. The only exceptional thing here was the CGI. Back then, it was so rare to call the CGI in a movie 'perfect', but this one deserved that. 95 % of those dinosaurs was real. However, I don't think for this reason apart that this movie got to be selected in the best 100 movies ever!The action was good, which's bad as long as we're talking about a (Spielberg) movie, where the action is always super. The ending was laconic and badly-directed, maybe that's because (Spielberg), as I knew later, had to be connected with (Schindler's List) while finishing this one in the same time. (Spielberg)'s specter of flying, as the ultimate pure dream, or as a reference to the victory of the spiritual nature against the terrestrial evil (from E.T, Hook, etc..) was portrayed in the end naively. (John Williams)'s music is better than the movie at times. And the message is simple: 'Don't play with nature'. Ok, it's simple and pretty old too!Therefore, I'm certain that the movie's huge success got something to do with factors outside of it (political, economical, social, whatever..) more than factors in it. Sometimes I read about this movie stuff that provokes me to the max, such as: 'Scrutinize closely the way the dinosaurs look with their eyes, then you'll understand the deep philosophy of Spielberg while he's dealing with the humanity's end??'. This kind of serious balderdash makes me so sick!So, eventually, it's nothing but good action, with good idea, and very good CGI, nothing more. In fact, it's a case of one movie that has been produced by 60 million dollar and has been propagandized by 68 million dollar, so you have to notice the power of publicity very well if you want to understand the success of this movie.Sorry, but after hearing about the score that this movie hit, watching it, then reading about the hidden grand meanings in it (!), I must say the 'O' word, which's maybe the most frequently used word in all of the reviews nowadays: This movie is 'Overrated'. At least I said it once!",7,0,6,20 February 2009
Valkyrie," Thrilling Documentary !
","Bryan Singer's Valkyrie (2008) reminded me of Anatole Litvak's The Night of the Generals (1967), and not for being - both - thrillers, taking place in Nazi Germany during WWII, and concerning German officers.Valkyrie depicts the 20 July 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. The plot failed, however Hitler ended up, not so long after, suicide (don't listen to Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds 2009!). So it's a movie where the good guys lose, which could allow a lukewarm feeling, especially while watching a Tom Cruise, Bryan Singer, Hollywood thriller. Unfortunately, that feeling fulfilled, yet due to extra other reasons.The script focused only on the star; Tom Cruise as Colonel Von Stauffenberg. Because save him, you don't know a thing about the rest of the plotters; Just slight touches to separate one from another, more than characteristic features. You're even less informed in places, to ask about the identity, and the necessity, of that man who swims in a pool, mocking at 'It's a drill, or not?', or that old, always infuriated, general who curses with insults like 'Montgomery's whore', with no good answers. So when United Artists propagandized Valkyrie as 'A character-driven thriller', you have to sense big deficiency.Sometimes not speaking in a movie, with meaty image, produces something great. In this movie, it's enjoyable in counted moments. Like when the lead is shaving, however awfully tortured. Or when he plans the whole Valkyrie plot, while listening to Wagner's music, beaten under the bombing. But in more moments, frank oddity was the result. For instance, when the lead returns home, first-time handicapped, there is nearly no dialogue uttered, even from his children (who leave him to play??). Another moment when he arrives Hitler's meeting, secretly carrying a time bomb to assassinate Hitler, the latter eyes him in fearful manner, inexplicably; as if the movie wants to delude us that Hitler exposed everything, and our lead is in danger, yet in a forced way to naive extent. Generally, that technique concerned about visual tense at the expense of drama, which left good amount of emptiness, while having - in the same time - many different characters, motives, and events.To add fuel to the flames, the dialogue was strictly informative more than expressive, witty, or fair to this blend of people. Many scenes, like the one of presenting the Valkyrie plan by the lead, felt extremely dry, exactly the way any uncreative documentary would make. Everybody speaks as directly as a robot. Any mildness is interdicted. And there wasn't enough heart. So when Terence Stamp's character commits suicide, easing up on himself: 'I remember better times', it's like the script's attempt to capture a historical moment, however sternly, with no juice or much background. This is why you eventually don't feel satisfied by the movie's list of actors like Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson and others. Because other than falling in the big shadow of Cruise's character, they were wronged by semi-mute script!In the operation part, things run clearly mute, with a feel of flat documentary. It isn't about the nature of Valkyrie's plot as a failure, or missing art re-writing history (a la Tarantino's movie); it's about preferring suspense on human beings, and in a movie with no familiar 'suspenseful-movie-climax'. So while the script strove to build exciting moment after another; it forgot to dilute the viewer's negative emotional load, out of executing all the plotters at last, with adequate character study. Therefore, the movie became a thrilling documentary about bunch of failures, more than character-driven thriller about courageous heroes.David Bamber as the Führer of Germany was perfectly pale, being a short unperceivable guy. Depriving Hitler from charisma and menace, in a movie where he's the main target and enemy, is a fatal mistake. And the movie's tricks to compensate this miscast, and misdirect, were pathetic as I showed early. John Ottman's music was too undertone to effect, enhancing the movie's cold character.Pros: There are plenty of well-made suspenseful moments. The CGI is impressively inspiring. Cruise counties smashing his image as Mr. Handsome, enjoying disfiguring his face, to assure that he doesn't need his good looks to gain capability and popularity, as he did before in Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Interview with the Vampire (1994), Vanilla Sky (2001), and Tropic Thunder (2008). But he was the usual serious him, with a few exceptional moments, where the script granted him with precious material, like when he looked at his assistance, after winning Hitler's signature on the revised Valkyrie, with the most concealed victorious smile in his eyes. Bill Nighy won the best character around, the man who with and against the plot, and he did it with powerful imprint.Valkyrie is pure thriller mixed with tepid documentary. It delivers the goods, but with undeniable disappointment; weather in terms of impossible happy end, or could-have-been possible dramatic satisfaction. It leaves you with more thrill than talks. While The Night of the Generals leaves you with more talks than thrill. Being unbalanced, in this part, is the main point of resemblance I meant between the 2 movies.",Null,0,0,30 June 2014
The Simpsons Movie," What ? How ? and Why ?!
","WHAT?While the viewing, I wrote some lines that could develop a review later, but I was in confusion what to entitle it, so read some of the nominees: (Not The Simpsons Movie; It's The Average Simpsons Episode!), (When 20 Minutes of Comedy Drag for 87!), (Disappointing!), (Not The Movie We Wanted!), or (Real Boring Episode.. But where is the movie?!!). However, mainly, I was in great confusion about the movie itself, asking: What was that anyway?!HOW?I'm a fan of the original TV show. And if you're one, you have to be angry all the way. The Simpsons is a wacky ride, and important part of its secret remains in its sophisticated details whether in the drawings or the gags, the constant satirical spirit towards EVERYONE and EVERYTHING, and playing all of that in fast pace. Accordingly, this movie must be hanged, or at least not to be called The Simpsons. And it excruciates me even more when I see at the closing credits how this movie was written by a little army of scriptwriters, leaded by the show's creator, and some of its writing's stars, with consultants as well!The writing was a catastrophe. If we come out of one episode with a huge amount of fun, then with a movie, a cinematic one, we must have more than that, read: 10 doubles the fun. But not this time. Because there are no swift gags, or parodied pop culture. I thought that I was watching a 'live' Disney family movie from the 1960s, but with sneering at the politicians. I don't know why they didn't use this incredible bunch of characters to produce comedy during, for instance, the city was under siege?? (For me, I adore Mr. Burns, he's my favorite, however all what he had was a scene?!!). The thing was that it didn't low the bar only, it gave us bad and dirty jokes too: The red Indian lady's breasts, Bart is unclothed, Bart is drinking, and the city's ignorant doctor is brutally murdered at last?? Look at a moment like when Melhouse knows about the bomb; his response was wearing a garbage basket! Is any of that funny? Not Simpsons funny, but just funny?? The answer is NO. It seems like stuff written by Ralph Wiggum!!And when it comes to the drama, don't get me starting; the storyline of Lisa and her boyfriend was totally aimless and humorless. Bart and Ned's was only interesting at the end. Some events were reused from the show; like Lisa got a boyfriend, spots of Homer's pet on the roof of the Simpsons' living room, Homer knows something about himself through primitive magic after acrid drink, Homer jumps over the canyon. Some moments were provocative. I mean what was the need to show Bart drinking Ned's cocoa, then cutting to dirty water that Marge wipes on the floor! Or seeing Burns, while the closing credits, talking about suicide (??) that was vague and useless. Basically, these closing credits weren't as half creative as some of the show's. Let alone the last shot which was a real killer; Homer is fixing the roof badly, so what's dazzling about that? Rather what's new?? I'm sure that utterly blank last shot is a reason why this movie will be hated by a lot of people. It's the weakest end that a movie can get!And where are the cameos??? I remember just Tom Hanks? Well, sometimes there were more than 4 high guest stars in one episode, now with a *Hollywood movie* all what we got was Tom Hanks??!! Tom is fine yes, but where is the rest of Hollywood for God's sake? Busy doing cameos for the show??!!The cinema's medium is different than the TV's. That truth is painful when it had been carried out here. Simply the cadres got no sophisticated details, and relayed much on the close-ups. Believe it or not, for the shows' addicts, that was one true reason for feeling the bore harshly. It made the TV show more cinematic I can tell you that!It comes to its senses in only the last 10 minutes as a comedy, visual riot, and drama. But that, apparently, was not enough. It even will make you ask yourself burningly: why the previous 77 Minutes weren't as hot as that??!! Aside from that sequence, I can't find something that good to hold to. Maybe the wildness of the main idea. Couple of lines and scenes (and I mean just couple!). Plus the extremely romantic finale between Homer and Marge. Though as a whole, none of that did 'leave us laughin''!WHY???It can join the list with the mystery of killing JFK, the accidents of Bermuda triangle, and the fact that there are actual fans of 'The Bold and The Beautiful'! Some may refer it to the self-fancy, excessive confidence, blah blah blah. Others may refer it to the fact that the team of writing was working since 18 years already, so they consumed the good ideas early. Well, I don't think this or that. I think that this movie didn't have the appropriate time all along. The show was running during the making of this movie, so they were working in the movie, and in the episodes together. Working in 2 things together always leads to: 2 bad things, or one bad thing. Anyway, I know that this movie wasn't that good, to a degree that makes you think whether it's a work of guys copycatting The Simpsons, or it's the show's makers doing their job insufficiently!Wanna the truth? The show is better; it's dynamic. This one is sluggish.",6,0,0,8 February 2010
The Island," The New Fascism & The Islan.. Sorry.. The Product !
","I read a lot about being a rip-off from (Logan's Run - 1976)?? Well, dear mistaken reviewers, it's more close to (THX 1138 - 1971) where the unexplained white customs and homes, the no convergence community, the protesting lead,.. etc. However, with a company this round as the ruler, not a tyrannical government.It is a fine Hollywood movie that got the too bright image, the chases, the explosions, namely the fun, all in one package. I tried many times to find a plot hole, but this script is so-sly-it's-solid, predicting all the questions to already answer them somewhere in the movie, even swiftly. It's only slight matters like why they killed the woman that gave birth to the child?, how (Scarlett Johansson) reentered the foundation with a gun and nobody noticed?!, and how (Ewan McGregor) put the plastic bracelet around his original human's hand that quick?! But anyway, it is incontestably one of the finest, most complete, movies done by (Michael Bay) where, in such a rare time, the editing and the story harmonize smartly; which is something that I didn't witness in (Pearl Harbor - 2001), (Bad Boys 2 - 2003), or surely (Armageddon - 1999)! Although (McGregor) is so pale as an action hero, sometimes unconvincing, however nothing harmed the final product. If there is one thing that really bugged me, then it's the ending. I think that they left it like this just hoping for a sequel, since it got no much sense; for instance, where all of these clones would go? How the lead would live? I bet he stole the costly boat to sail with it at the last shot!On a personal level, I hated ignoring the great potential of the story. I mean what a treasure indeed to make a perfect action that got meanings. In another treatment, (The Island) could have been a high sci-fi, with the same amount of fun, that fits for endless viewings. But it didn't utilize areas like the irony of one rich community that doesn't stand pain and wants to live forever on one side, and another poor one, with identical citizens, that got no will at all, being exploited for the sake of money and living well on the other side. Look also at the missing circle where the differences between the lead and his source; how the lead personifies the good in him, or abstracts his best as a human. Let alone the storyline of (Scarlett Johansson) and her original (the sick model and her baby) which turned into so trivial, rather forgotten, matter. Or the lost concept of the 'The Island' itself; does freedom is the lost island of everyone? Does dreaming in a subdued constant society make its dreamer an island? Does humanity became an island in the world of today? You have to notice how ultimately the title was bigger than the final movie. And how this script just intellectually implies, as it has no time except for action and popcorn.You have to notice also that the movies that speak about closed secret worlds became too many lately. Just remember (The Truman Show - 1999), (The Matrix - 1999), (The Village - 2004).. etc. where the trick is always on, and the people are always ruled by deceiver superiors who own the acknowledge, and control it evilly. I think it's one speech which comes from the fear of locked society, owned by foundations this round, where the human is nothing but a tool in the hands of richer masters, being used without will or consciousness. It's simply not the fear of another communism. No. It's the fear of fascism that got the ugliest of both; the communism and the capitalism. It's clear even in a work that just wants to be the polished product.(The Island - 2005) is highly entertaining, but it didn't deliver intellectually as it did visually. And it's typical I think, since it's produced by another foundation which needs its products to be as pure as possible, without extra - especially deep - qualities. Now I dream of more intellectual, same entertaining, remake. Hmmm, maybe in another island!",7,0,3,5 October 2009
