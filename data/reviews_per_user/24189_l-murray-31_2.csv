Scarface," Brian De Palma's SCARFACE...
","I first saw this movie way back in 1984(on video, then on a re-release in 85). At the time I took it to be an OTT representation of the violence that stems from the drugs scene in the USA. As a Brit-i have often seen American obsessions become UK obsessions--drugs, and the gang violence are now a popular export from the USA.Tony Montana's rapid rise and equally rapid fall are two reasons to watch Scarface--coupled with De Palma's superb direction, and his feel for the sleazy/gaudy Miami of the early 1980s, working with Oliver Stone's searing script--this remains a brutal-and often nasty movie, Tony has few redeeming features, and his aware of his own infallibility, but he is prepared to be the best 'Doper on the Block'. Al Pacino in a career defining role--only surpassed three times since in my opinion.Beautifully lit by John Alonzo whom often had to trick the audience, they were in Miami, rather than L.A((Due to been asked to leave Miami and film elsewhere), a terrific supporting cast:Michelle Phiffer in her breakthrough role, the late Paul Shenar as Alex the drugs kingpin. Robert Loggia as Tony's initial backer, F.Murray Abraham as the conniving Omar, Steven Bauer as Manny, Tony best friend...A still remarkable and blunt movie...",Null,0,2,29 August 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Tinker Tailor...Superb, Adult Spy Drama...
","This excellent second adaptation of Le Carre's classic espionage novel, famously adapted by the BBC in 1979-Alec Guinness playing the eponymous George Smiley(a name that is at best a misnomer), followed by Smiley's People in 1982, Death of a Schoolboy never followed due to the Usual BBC budget constraints.Now we have a real movie version-that stands on its own merits-Gary Oldman takes Smiley and makes him his own-younger than Guinness and far more sinister, he sees and hears everything, Oldman is supported by a brilliant cast-Kay Burke(finally back on our screens) as Connie, Benedict Cumberbatch(in a beautifully rewritten supporting role)the always excellent Toby Jones, Tom Hardy, and Mark Strong, whom is in danger of becoming a major star. Lastly Colin Firth-proving what a versatile actor he is (post Oscar)and Lastly John Hurt as Control--another superb performance of him.Events are telescoped, re-jigged and we (the audience )are given key information at different times than the original TV series, due to the 2hr running time of the movie. It all works though, from the production design , editing directing and lighting to look like a rundown London of the seventies and Hungary(Checkozakia in the original).
