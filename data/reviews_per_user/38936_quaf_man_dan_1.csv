The Ring," Remake of Ring (Ringu)
","This film is actually a remake of a new classic, the 1998 Japanese horror film called 'Ring' or 'Ringu' as it is called on the UK DVD release. Therefore if it is similar to FearDotCom (I haven't seen it) it's probably because FearDotCom ripped off this highly original idea from KÃ´ji Suzuki (upon whose novel the film was based).  I would recommend watching the original Ring first, with the lights out, and the volume up!",Null,0,0,28 October 2002
