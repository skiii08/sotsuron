The Blair Witch Project," ...now *that* was truly terrifying (not?)
","Not the traditional horror flick at all. Certainly not scary in the usual sense... It's basically a psychological suspense-thriller based on the unknown; the obvious occult bits simply appeal to our tendency to associate the unknown with the supernatural (for all I care the antagonists could be a bunch of downright sadistic and smart pranksters). So the expected chills were there, but they were mainly lurking in the back of my mind while I found myself thinking aloud over their actions (at one point I was laughing with ridicule at the whole situation; now *that* was truly terrifying). Ending smells slightly of a cop-out, but would make good fan-theory fodder. Good film to catch, if only for the novelty of it (even if the nausea-inducing camera work didn't help the fact that I'd just had my meal) but by no means a great one. (7/10)",7,0,1,2 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'I'll be following this trilogy with great interest...'
","Firstly, it wouldn't be fair for me to compare this film side-by-side with its predecessors, at least not until all of the first trilogy have been released. It did take me a number of rewatches of Episodes 4,5,6 before I could confidently say that The Empire Strikes Back was my pick. The Phantom Menace is the introduction to an introductory trilogy, and I'm glad to have set my expectations to just that level. Things happen on a smaller scale here, so expecting a grand galaxy-saving plotline is most probably an invitation to disappointment.Some have said that as a screenwriter Lucas's style is just space-opera, and in many ways that's true. Nevertheless any complaints on the drama aspect shouldn't be heaped upon Neeson, McGregor or the others. Overall I thought all of the actors did commendable work, considering the nature of the script. Jar-Jar and the Gungans were obviously characters created with light comedy in mind, but they weren't as irritating as I had feared (personally I would say that they're about one step up from the Ewoks). In any case, I have no real problem with this at all.However the story per se is the main reason I watched the film. TPM has put together a pretty solid tale of the beginnings of the main characters, and executed it well. By now they should be adequately fleshed-out to deal with the many changes I'm sure will take place in the next two instalments. The Jedi mythology plays a large role here, with light being shed on many key aspects. Most striking of all is how it depicted Anakin Skywalker, so young and spirited. I had the strange impression that the Jedi Council's reaction to him, the looks on their faces, said it all about his future. It seemed that now and then the film hinted ever so subtly at his eventual fate.As with the other episodes, TPM is replete with brilliant moments. For me the high point was the pod-race, where Lucas's inventiveness was at its best. Locales like Coruscant, Naboo and Tatooine were nothing short of triumphs in design production. Then there were the much-raved lightsabre duels, which I found to rival the best ones in the previous trilogy in both intensity and duration. My head had started to ache gloriously when it ended! Darth Maul didn't do much more than glower and fight but for this formidable villain, I'm grateful that his actions spoke louder than his words.Two thumbs up to Lucas and the crew, whose sheer technical ambition alone deserves an award. Once again he's created a universe, a STAR WARS universe, that contains enough diversity, richness and depth to justify the special effects. Admittedly it's a bit overwhelming at times, but never stifling. More often than not my eyes couldn't help but scour a particular scene, just to appreciate the amount of detail put into them.All I can say in the end is: well done. The Force is strong enough in this one. Now is the right time for me to raise my expectations. 8.5/10 (includes 0.5 of SW fan bias :) )",7,0,0,1 July 1999
Fight Club," 'Woohoo!'
","Envision the surreal psycho-drama of Being John Malkovich, pump in some testosterone overdrive and anti-establishment satire (and heck even a Sixth Sense twist at the end!) and I found myself in one of the downright craziest films ever. Also the soundtrack turns out to be one of the most distinctive along with that of The Matrix. Still I found it thoroughly enjoyable and deserves to be one of the must-watch titles of 1999. (A strong 7/10).",8,0,1,1 January 2000
Amistad," 'Give us FREE!'
","Joseph Cinque's rousing cry in the courtroom said it all, something so singularly gripping that for me it defines the entire movie. One may find points to praise or criticise in yet another one of Spielberg's distinctive 'historicals' but few messages have ever been simpler or clearer: It's all for nothing if you don't have freedom! (if I may quote a certain Scottish patriot who was about as passionate). As for the rest of the film, pretty well-done actually. Solid 8/10.",7,0,1,1 October 2000
Dead Poets Society," A fairly good Robin Williams vehicle if nothing else
","Well-produced and well-acted, with Robin Williams as the standout (in one of his more consistently bearable performances). Essentially it's about some students who 'carpe diem' to varying degrees of success/failure. One overcomes shyness (well, sort of); one succumbs to parental pressure (in an eerie, overwrought, somewhat awkward scene); one gets his girl; one gets TWO girls; all participate in nocturnal cave meetings whose purpose I can't easily seem to relate to that of a poets' society (the dead ones would certainly turn in their graves methinks). Overall the story seems to have bitten off more than it can chew, and the final effect is one of dramatic indigestion. A better recommendation (and yet more Robin Williams) would be Good Will Hunting (1997). And if for some reason you're suddenly hooked on adolescents spouting poetry and wish to be punished, then go for Romeo+Juliet (1996). A weak 7/10.",6,0,1,5 August 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Of furballs and a fitting end to the Star Wars trilogy
","Being forced to choose, I would pick this movie as the lesser of the Star Wars trilogy. I agree that it's mostly due to the Ewok factor, but for me it's not the cute furballs themselves. It's the sight of a fully-equipped Imperial force being brought to its knees by a bunch of primitive antics that grates on logic. In a genre that calls for some suspension of disbelief, this is not too good -- bad even, for some viewers I suspect, so be prepared.That aside, this is a more than competent conclusion to this chapter of the Star Wars saga. George Lucas continues to keep it all moving along with his vision (a rarity nowadays among sci-fi film-makers), and production-wise you can expect improvements over its predecessors. The best scenes are those revolving around the Skywalker Jedi legacy, the well-done space battles, and of course the final confrontation that sees a long-overdue redemption leading to the inevitable triumph of Good over Evil.Despite its relative weaknesses, Return of the Jedi still stands as part of the one of the most accomplished and enduring trilogies yet. And it takes much more than a forest full of furballs to completely sink a Star Wars movie.",8,0,1,30 November 1998
American Beauty," Wow, dead men _do_ tell tales...
","One of those rare gems to come out for a long while. This time a quaintly (well you guessed) beautiful film about some majorly screwed-up families. An 'Ice Storm' for the 90's comes first to my mind. Kevin Spacey was a solid performer as I had expected, carrying us through a potent tale about life, living, love, and most of all: letting it all go. (hmm, Thora Birch was also a deciding factor here... move over Christina Ricci!) A 1999 must watch. (strong 8/10)",8,0,0,29 January 2000
Saving Private Ryan," A masterpiece ripped apart and stitched together...
","...in a way that only Spielberg could. Really, if the man wants to be realistic, you can expect reality. Nothing in recent memory can surpass the impact of that beach landing carnage. It's the hideous, laughing face of War personified, and seeing that is the most disturbing aspect of this film.Unfortunately, I have to agree that the work as a whole seemed flawed. To put it bluntly, it's a story reminiscent of an episode of Combat (now that someone brought it up), plus some movie-scale battle scenes. All bound by that flashback structure. It all held together all right, but just a tad less satisfactorily. It's painfully (yet distantly) similar to what Titanic suffered from.Nonetheless high production values, all-round good performances, and an undeniable capacity to put you 'right there' in the middle of the action (the apprehension was almost unbearable during the early moments of the final battle) far outweigh the gripes. Heck I still ended up giving it an 8/10. That's a 'Go watch it!' rating.",8,0,0,24 November 1998
The Game," Douglas at his neurotic best, yet again
","Chock-full of twists and turns till the very end, it's worth watching for its pure thriller value alone. One of the most potent mind-play movies in the recent past. I even developed a somewhat sickening sympathy for Scrooge Van Orton. Not that the plot leaves you with many others to root for anyway. Though I'm biased against suspension-of-disbelief stories in general, this one certainly has the makings of a first-rate thriller.",7,0,1,29 October 1998
Reservoir Dogs," A Tarantino-fest of chatting, cheating, stealing, and killing
","Tarantino's more visceral film-making ingredients are here, all pumped up to the max. Suit-and-tie baddies argue and BS each other regularly in expletive-laden conversations, with sudden outbursts of violence in between. Even in the resulting bloody mess of gunshot wounds and mutilation they still have to keep talking. Unspoken directives for them could be: talk, shoot/kill, talk, and perhaps get shot/killed in return. This kind of existence becomes almost an art form in Tarantino's hands.Overall performance can only be good with a cast like that, and this should be more than enough to make Reservoir Dogs a classic for fans of Mr. T. Not bad, just feels incomplete, probably because this is a post-Pulp Fiction review. A tad above 7/10.",7,0,1,24 February 1999
