Kill Bill: Vol. 2," perfection
","i, like everyone else, had high expectations for this film, having adored the first one. For a start, this is a very different film, and i had realised that was going to be the case from early after seeing vol.1, and i was first in line to see the second part.I gotta say, this film is sheer perfection.sure, its not as action packed as the first one, but so what, action doesn't make a film good, in fact, its often the opposite. Vol.2 is more intelligent, witty, funny, and emotional than the first. now, i though the first film was a perfect film, but this takes the cake. the great post modern inclusions of the truth injection, and the five point palm exploding heart technique were fantastic.This film is not only, by far, Tarantino's best, its also one of the best films ever made. a more than worthy sequel to the first slice of perfection cake, that was vol.1.",10,1,2,27 April 2004
Spider-Man 2," Unbelievable
","I am not a 'fan' of superhero films, but more a fan of decent films, with depth, intelligence, and a good story. Spiderman 2 excels in all of the above. It is simply fantastic. True, I am within the target audience of elder teens to 20 something's, and I have grown up adoring Spiderman, but I've also grown up seeing how the film industry can destroy my heroes (batman and robin being the prime example). Spiderman 2 is not just a magnificent 'superhero film', it is also a magnificent film compared with any other.I loved the way the plot unfolded, and the different stages the story went through. It worked as a comedy film, a romantic film, a personal conflict film, and an action film.In fact, on reflection, I reckon Spiderman is only in about 10% of the film, the rest is Peter Parker, and wonderful character development.This film is nothing short of marvelous, great direction, and brilliant build up. It worked perfectly on my emotions. The film, of course, is not perfect. Many part of the Doc Ock plot are a bit too superhero (like the end in xmen 1), especially the whole 'power of the sun' bit.Yet this film had me crying. Three times.Twice with emotion, to do with the romantic storyline, the other was crying with laughter at the wonderful and hilarious 'raindrops keep falling on my head' scene.All in all, this film has much more depth, emotion, and character and plot development than most Oscar awarded films, and deserves to stand with them, regardless of genre, or believability.In my brother's words, 'the best sequel ever made'.",10,0,0,20 July 2004
