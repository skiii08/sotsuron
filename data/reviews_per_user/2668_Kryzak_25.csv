Mission: Impossible III," Not a bad movie to escape to.
","Overall, this was a decent movie. The stunts are definitely breathtaking as always, and the acting is good for an action movie. What I did like is their focus on the character of Ethan Hunt, though at parts it got really cheesy and corny. I don't really have much to say about this movie, as there's nothing really new about any of the plot lines or story. Even with all the TomKat controversy and Tom Cruise being a bit strange lately, I still think that this is *his* franchise and he does a good job with it. Thus, my final recommendation is if you want a good summer action movie to escape to, M:I3 is a good one to do that with.",6,1,12,10 May 2006
Source Code," Impressive movie and an intelligent thriller!
","It's rare to see such a fast paced, compact, and beautifully woven movie these days. While the plot device is out there (it is sci-fi, after all), the movie offers just enough explanation to satisfy the hard core techies without bogging the whole movie down. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering what will happen in the next 8-minute loop to the main character. Jake Gyllenhaal and the rest of the cast did a great job here humanizing the characters and making this a movie more about the people than the background or the mission.This movie would have been a 10/10 if only the ending were a bit better. As it stands, it is a feel good ending, but if it ended 5 minutes earlier at that crucial scene on the train (for those of you who have seen it, you know exactly the moment I'm taking about), I think this would have been a perfect film.",9,0,0,15 April 2011
United 93," Powerful beyond belief...
","After teetering between a 9 and 10, I have decided to give this movie a 10 for the impact it had on me. A couple weeks after seeing the movie, I still can't get the images of the brave passengers of United 93 out of my head; I still tear up every time I think about how they sacrificed their lives so that the terrorists could not destroy one more building (and probably kill more people in the process); and I still get angry every time I think of what happened on 9/11/2001. This movie brought back painful memories of that day that need to be brought back, just because we live in a country that often forgets too easily.Don't worry, I won't go into any political statements here, as this space is reserved for movie reviews. As a movie, 'United 93' is meticulously done, with no hint of exploitation at all. Like everyone else, I was afraid of the 'Tom Cruise Action Hero' syndrome where some of the passengers are played by top name action stars and do some unrealistic heroics (those were saved for M:I3, thank goodness! =P), and we get cheesy background stories of each and every passengers so we can 'sympathize' with them more. I doubt we need to know much about the passengers of the flight to sympathize (or empathize) with them. The situation itself, the fear and terror of having a bomb on a plane, the knowledge that 3 planes already crashed into 3 landmark buildings in the US, and the final realization that they must do something that will guarantee death to stop this plane from doing the same, is powerful enough that no other traditional movie plot devices are necessary to add to feelings that we as the audience have. I am VERY glad that Paul Greengrass, the director realized that and did the movie a la 'documentary' style. What turned out is a movie that way more powerful in its simplicity than any other movies with a lot more 'fluff' around them.The choice to pick actual people to play themselves (the FAA director, the military commander, etc) was brilliant, as well as picking no-name actors who can still act really well. This way the audience really sees what the people felt on that fateful day, and are not distracted by famous actors and realizing they're just acting a part. All the actors did a great job in portraying the emotions of that day, and the editing is tight and well paced. The only complaint I have is the shakiness of the camera. I know it was on purpose to show the chaos and spontaneity of the event, but for people like me who get motion sickness from that type of movement (see my Constant Gardner review) it was really difficult for me to sit through the movie (for various other reasons too).As for the terrorists, I really felt that they were portrayed in a very neutral light, and I applaud the director for this decision. It is all too easy to demonize them as mass murderers with no humanity in them, but there is always a flip side of the coin, a story behind every action. They believe as strongly about what they're doing is right as the passengers on the plane believing that fighting back is the right thing. It is an unfortunately clash of beliefs and cultures that had tragic results, and the movie clearly and unflinchingly showed this.All in all, a brilliant film that captures the confusion, the fear, the terror, and the shock of 9/11 without an ounce of fluff, exploitation, or unnecessary material. I STRONGLY recommend people to go watch this, even if it will be very difficult and painful, because the victims and heroes of that day deserve to be remembered and honored, and this is a great film made to honor them.",10,3,7,10 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Solid Entertaining Movie
","So I finally saw the movie that the entire nation has been buzzing about (top 1-day gross, beating Star Wars Ep 3, and top 3 day gross, beating Spiderman 2), and I must say, it was an entertaining film, though not as deep or complex as the first one.Again, like the first movie, 'The Curse of the Black Pearl', the movie is fun, entertaining, has good graphics, and supported by a very strong cast that includes the great Johnny Depp, as well as Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Other than the sometimes hard-to-comprehend 'pirate talk' and a somewhat confusing/convoluted plot line, I enjoyed my 2.5 hours in the theater. Not much to say beyond that, other than I'm looking forward to the third (and final?) installment of the series to see what our beloved Captain Jack Sparrow is up to!",7,1,3,15 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Magical Fun!
","Narnia can be summarized by two words: magical fun! As a kids movie, it was nearly perfect (if I were a decade or two younger ), but as a complete movie that stirs the soul, I can only give it an 8 (which is a very good score in my book!). Before I say anything, Tilda Swinton was simply BREATHTAKING (no pun intended) as the Witch in this movie! Her every move, every look, every gesture was pure art, grace, and *evil*! She literally stole the show and carried the movie, both at the same time.Otherwise, the story was fun if you watch it from a child's point of view. The special effects were done quite well (except for maybe a couple scenes here and there where you can tell it's a blue/green screen), and the child actors weren't too bad either. The little girl was definitely my favorite out of the 4 kids. Of course, there are many comparisons to Lord of the Rings, and I find myself thinking 'Gandalf!' when I saw Santa Claus, or 'Galadriel' when seeing the witch... Also, for fellow RPG geeks out there, my friend and I thought that Peter must have walked around in the same place to 'level up' so that he went from not knowing how to use a sword to killing minotaurs...There were some concerns about heavy handed religious overtones in the movie, but that wasn't a problem at all. It was handled quite well and fit the story.All in all, great movie! Allow yourself to live your childhood again and you'll be immersed in the wonderful world of Narnia.",7,1,1,16 December 2005
Hot Fuzz," It is hilarious!!!
","This movie is AWESOME! I liked 'Shaun of the Dead', but the humor in there wasn't 'roll on the floor laughing' type humor (for me). 'Hot Fuzz' takes the same lead and a similar cast, and makes an even better spoof of police movies like 'Bad Boys' and 'Point Break.' The first 2/3 of the movie was clever, funny, and well done, but as I realized after the movie, EVERYTHING was there to set up for the last 1/3 of the movie. The last part of the movie made me laugh so hard my stomach hurt! The absurdity of the situation combined with the action sequences were a match made in heaven. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes a good spoof and a good laugh!",9,2,4,30 May 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Haunting, Heartbreaking, and Powerful
","First of all, I'd like to state that this movie transcends politics, religion, agendas, and even the mis-marketed 'gay cowboy' tag-line. It is a movie about two people and their undeniable emotions for each other.With that said, I am still haunted (like many other viewers out there) by Brokeback Mountain a day after seeing it. Not too many movies moved me emotionally like this movie did. In case you were wondering, the other movies that affected me like this were Schindler's List, The Green Mile, and A Very Long Engagement. Let me break this movie down to it's basics: Direction: Ang Lee has crafted a masterpiece out of Brokeback Mountain. I've only seen '1.5' movies by him (Crouching Tiger and parts of The Wedding banquet) and wasn't super impressed. Now I thank him for making such an efficient, concise, and superbly directed movie. With the help of the screenplay writers, the pace of the movie was just right (maybe a little hurried in some spots), the cinematography was breathtaking, the emotions captured on film was brutally honest and powerful, and the story was faithfully adapted from Annie Proulx's short story. He deserves an Oscar nomination (or even win) for this effort.Acting: I've also never been impressed by Heath Ledger's resume in the past (A Knight's Tale, Four Feathers, etc...), but he simply shocked me with his performance in Brokeback Mountain. I never thought he could portray such nuanced and subtle emotions, through his accented mumbling (some people may need subtitles to understand what he's saying =P), than he did here. The fear and conflicting emotions that Heath's Ennis del Mar experiences were fully transferred to me watching in the audience. I've always enjoyed Jake Gyllenhaal's performances (Donnie Darko, Jarhead, and even Bubble Boy/Day After Tomorrow), and his Jack Twist was a perfect foil to Ennis. While many will argue that Jake's role was an 'easier' one, I disagree with that conclusion. I believe Jake's character was just as complex because his Jack Twist had to be the perfect foil to Ennis. Jack's extroversion and playfulness balanced by an inner longing, sorrow, and frustration that was beautifully portrayed in this movie. Both of the lead characters deserve Oscar nominations for their performances and I will be watching out for their future films from now on. While many reviewers were impressed by Michelle William's Alma character, I thought it was good but nothing outstanding. Maybe I've seen too many 'suffering wife' type characters or just wasn't drawn into her performance completely? I don't know. Anne Hathaway was definitely brilliant in the final telephone scene, and she played her character pretty well. Otherwise, the rest of the cast acted very well and the movie gel-ed together perfectly because of the supporting actors.All in all, I strongly recommend this movie for those of you who are willing to watch it with an open mind and no judgments. It is not a movie with an agenda and the story is brutally honest and powerful. Like many reviews already said, it's about two people who love each other, no matter their sex or sexuality. It's also about being honest with your emotions and showing the people you care about that you love them. This movie has earned a spot on my list of great movies, and I hope it will on yours too.",10,16,20,11 December 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Not bad
","I liked this movie a little bit more than the 2nd one, 'Dead Man's Chest'. The plot was a bit confusing at times, and they tried to cram way too much story into the movie (it's a 2 hr 40 minute movie), but in the end, it was entertaining and fun to watch. The acting from Johnny Depp is good as usual, and the action/CGI sequences are even more breathtaking than the previous 2 movies. They throw in some good laughs throughout the movie, though sometimes the situations are a bit more absurd than they should be (especially near the end). All in all, a good 'adventure novel' type movie to watch. If you liked the first 2 movies, you'll like this one. Oh yeah, stay till the end of the credits for a good scene.",6,24,41,30 May 2007
Match Point," Thrilling and Complex!
","Wow! 'Match Point' was my first Woody Allen movie, and DANG it was good! I came out of the movie all giddy and excited about how good this movie was, no wonder it's now sitting at #5 in my top movies of 2005! The movie was clever, exciting, suspenseful, involving, artistic, and powerful all at the same time. I must say that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (who was also in 'Bend It Like Beckham') outdid himself and delivered a knock-out performance as the social-ladder climbing/adulterating husband in the movie! His portrayal of his guilt, indecision, and passion are so raw yet nuanced that I can fully appreciate the dilemma that his character has to go through in the movie. It seems that there are so many good performances by a male lead in the past month that the Oscar race is definitely shaping up to be a slug-out! All the other supporting actors in the movie were very good, though not as many got the chance to shine like Meyers. I believe he stole the show.As for the screenplay and directing by Woody Allen, I must say that I am very very impressed! The story had twists and turns that kept me guessing. Every time I thought I figured out the ending, something else (believable) pops up. The whole theme that was set in the beginning ('I'd rather be lucky than good') was laced throughout the movie, to a very good effect. I especially loved Allen's inclusion of literature, art, and music into this movie, and the story draws its strength from all three aspects. The movie explores many topics including adultery, wealth vs love, guilt, passion, and of course, luck vs skill. All this, mixed in with some great music (mostly from an tragic opera - is that a redundancy? ), led me through a roller coaster ride of emotions and lots of anxiety for the characters' fate in the movie. I attribute that to Woddy Allen's superb directorial skills! I remember reading a review for this movie that said, 'To call this movie Woody Allen's comeback is an understatement!' I fully agree with that assessment! The *only* flaw I found in the movie was Jonathan Rhys-Meyer's tennis forehand... for a pro that supposedly played against Agassi and Rusedski, his forehand was quite painful to watch... haha! But hey, the movie is so good I can forgive him for that! So what are you waiting for? Go see the movie already! You'll be thrilled!",9,1,3,9 February 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Hauntingly Beautiful
","WOW! This movie is so hauntingly beautiful and original that I left the theater in awe! Who knew the director of 'The Mimic' and 'Hellboy' (Guillermo del Toro) would have this movie in his back pocket?? Even though I was slightly disappointed that there weren't more fantasy scenes in the movie (I was thinking along the lines of Narnia), but was still awed by the expert directing that del Toro used to mixed harsh reality with terrifying fantasy. The movie keeps everyone guessing on whether the fantasy is completely in the little girl's head, or if it actually exist in reality. This puzzle keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, especially during the dangerous sequences where the girl tries to escape the fantasy world. In the end, when everything is revealed, the solution is satisfying and original.The cinematography is superb in this movie, accentuating the mood and atmosphere of every scene and sometimes blurring the lines separating reality with fantasy. I was in awe the entire time at how vivid, complex, and frightening the girl's imagination was, and how necessary it is for her to escape the painful life she lives in.For me, it was the ending that glued the entire movie together into a very powerful work of art. I won't spoil the movie or the surprise here, but I strongly encourage everyone to see this wonderful movie! (Oh yeah, do NOT bring your kids under 12 to see this movie, it's quite scary and violent at times)",9,2,4,29 January 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Brilliant, Glamorous, and Delightfully Sinful!
","Wow, where should I start??? Normally I wouldn't go watch a movie about fashion, but after pretty much every single one of my friends told me to go watch this movie, I went and checked it out...AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID! The movie, even though trashed by some critics as 'shallow and unfulfilling', is sinfully delicious! The key ingredient to the genius and brilliance of this movie is Meryl Streep, one of the best actors in the history of film. She plays the role of the editor-in-chief of the fake fashion magazine, 'Runway', so well that she makes the entire movie a joy to watch. Add that to the strong performances of Anne Hathaway and (especially) Emily Blunt, as the first assistant to Streep, this movie is delightful to sit through.Not knowing much about women's fashion, I must say all the clothes, accessories, and style that the women in the movie wear were pretty nice (obviously I'm not a good judge of women's fashion =P). What makes the film shine is the ATTITUDE that each of the people in the fashion industry brings on screen. You'll laugh at the outrageous (and sometimes decadent) indulgences these people have in their clothes and looks, their arrogance, and their contempt for the 'sad people' who do not understand or care for fashion.All in all, the story wasn't anything deep, so just go and watch the movie for the great performances and the 'high-class' laughs that it packs. I sure hope Meryl Streep gets a nomination for Best Actress Oscars come January!!",9,5,10,23 August 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Intelligent and 'politely' funny...
","After all the hype about this movie, I finally went to see it. I must say that it is a very clever and well acted movie, with a very intelligent script and dialogue. Maybe it's just personal taste, but I found myself laughing at many parts of the movie just politely (as opposed to falling out of my seat laughing). I'm not quite sure why I didn't think this was the funniest movie in a long time, but maybe it's the implausibility of the setup (how dysfunctional can a family get?) or maybe the jokes are too intelligent? Anyway, I don't want to slam this movie, as it is very well made and I loved all the actors in the film. The scene at the end is priceless, as it glaringly shows the hypocrisy of these 'beauty pageants'. Overall, a pleasant film that won't disappoint!",7,3,12,4 October 2006
Over the Hedge," Funny, Witty, and Well voiced!
","While this movie doesn't have the depth of Finding Nemo or Shrek, it was a very fun and well done animation by Dreamworks. The animation was first rate, and the animals were very fun to watch. The voice acting was superb and well cast. What I enjoyed the most about this movie (other than the super funny bits here and there) is the social commentary they presented. It's nothing serious, but it shows us how gluttonous many of us 'humans' have become. While many of the human characters are exaggerations, there's quite a bit of truth behind each caricature. My favorite is the Home Owner Association President. She was so overdone (yet so realistic!) that I wasn't sure if I was laughing because it was so true to life, or if it was just so out there.Anyway, good movie, good times, and go with good company. After some mediocre animation movies from Dreamworks, they hit a good one again with Over the Hedge.",7,60,68,26 May 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not as good as the first two, but not bad
","Definitely not the best X-men movie , but good enough as an action movie.With so much potential embedded in the plot lines (would you choose to become 'normal' again if there's a cure for the mutant gene? how do you deal with an evil version of a former teammate?), I am quite disappointed that the movie doesn't explore any of the issues in more depth similar to the first two X-men movies. My biggest gripe is the movie run time of 1 hour and 40 minutes. The previous movies were both 2 hours long, and this one *clearly* feels rushed for many of the scenes. The extra 20 minutes that Brett Ratner shaved off this movie could have dramatically improved it.Gripes I had: - Jean Grey really didn't get much story development other than in the very beginning. She just stood there and looked cool most of the movie - Angel had pretty much *nothing* to say in the movie - Lots of disposable characters that were barely introduced and killed off (SPOILER ALERT!) - While I actually liked some of the 'removal' of main characters, I thought not enough time was spent on making the loss impact more.Otherwise, if you look at this movie as a pure action movie, it's one of the better ones out there. So do check it out. =)",7,0,1,15 July 2006
Hero," Truly Amazing Movie...
","If I compared this to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which was a very good movie, but lacking in emotional content and a bit incoherent (the part in the desert was very out of place and slow to me), I thought Hero was a much better made movie.* Spoilers Ahead *1. I felt that Hero had a very tight story line, about a man (Nameless) trying to assassinate the first Emperor.  I really liked how they recalled each of the events in the past, at a slightly different angle and viewpoint. It reminded me of Run Lola Run a bit, which is another film I really liked.2. The colors and cinematography in this movie was just AMAZING!  It was on par or even better than Crouching Tiger's3.  The fight scenes in here are full, complete, and not short and broken like Crouching...4. The one thing I REALLY liked about the movie was how it made us look at something from a different view point (which I think is what this movie is all about).  Different people have completely different interpretations of a single event.  Even though the First Emperor has always been a villan in Chinese history, and done a lot of very terrible things, the way the movie portrays him brings out a very valid opposing view.  Yes, unification of a country is a very hard thing to do, and one has to take certain measure to do it.  Could we blame him for what he did, as it led to one of the golden ages in China (The Han dynasty) shortly after?  Who knows, since it's all 2000+ years in the past.  All in all, this was a brilliant film, and I wished it came out before Crouching Tiger so it could have gotten more buzz instead of being called a 'copy cat' movie... Cheers! 10/10 Kryzak",10,0,0,5 September 2003
Children of Men," Emotionally disconnected, but a good movie nevertheless
","I had very high hopes going into 'Children of Men', and although I wasn't completely satisfied, the movie explored a very possible and realistic dark future for mankind if there were no babies for 18 years. The movie is dark, depressing, and draws you into a world that has lost hope and where governments enact fascist regimes to keep civilization from falling apart. People either try to live on hopelessly or take government sanctioned suicide kits to end the misery. Happy stuff, huh? =) With this in mind, Alfonso Cuaron does a great job creating the world, the atmosphere, an the believability of the world. There're no sci-fi gadgets or technobabble popping up in a movie that could have easily fallen into that trap. The cause of the infertility remains hidden, and only the effects are shown. Different people react to the situation differently and is well portrayed by the various actors in the movie. Clive Owen and the girl playing 'Kit' does a great job throughout the movie trying to survive and reach a utopia called the 'Human Project', hoping that her pregnancy will save mankind.While the movie didn't engage me as much as I had hoped, I appreciate and admire Cuaron's mastery of making a movie as thoughtful, realistic, and depressing as this one. Don't get me wrong, it's a very well made movie in all aspects, but for me, the lack of any explanation and too many loose ends not tied up irked me a little. Overall, a strong movie that should be watched, but it could have been much better.",7,2,6,7 January 2007
Blood Diamond," Bloody and tragic portrayal of life in Africa
","Blood Diamond takes a look at the diamond business in Sierra Leone in 1999. Most of the diamonds minded in that country at the time were called 'blood diamonds' because of all the death and destruction they caused. The money from the diamonds were used to buy weapons to start civil wars, massacres, and enslave more people to mine more diamonds. The film might be fictional, but I'm pretty sure exploitation of Africa is still happening everywhere on that continent, whether it's for diamonds, oil, ivory, or any other precious resources.Thus, before I go into the review, please make sure that any diamonds you buy is NOT a 'conflict diamond' so you don't support more bloodshed and tragedy in Africa. (I'll get off the soap box now) The movie was good, if only because of the amazing acting talents of Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Honsou, and the unflinching and often explicitly violent depiction of war torn Africa/Sierra Leone. Watching one village after another getting slaughtered for no reason other than 'revolution' or diamonds was painful (but necessary) to watch. Along with 'Lord of War' and 'The Constant Gardner', 'Blood Diamond' is a film that everyone should see to understand the plight of those who are much more unfortunate than us.I believe with 'The Departed' and this movie, Leo should be getting an Oscar nomination soon, and Djimon Honsou was a very capable supporting actor. The storyline was a bit long and dragged out at moments, and some scenes were too sappy, but overall, I give this movie a high score because of the issues it explored and the strong performances (as well as the great cinematography).Go check it out. It'll make you appreciate what you have in life and think again when you look for your next diamond purchase.",8,0,0,13 December 2006
Reservoir Dogs," Deeply Disappointed
","I've been wanting to see this movie since it came out. This was *the* movie to see as a college student (along with 'Swingers' and 'Pulp Fiction'), but I was deeply disappointed by it. For the first 30 minutes, I was just hoping the trademark Tarentino 'dialogue' would end!!! I know Tarentino is very good at dialogue, but sometimes he overdoes it (also in 'Grindhouse: Death Proof') and he definitely does so in this movie. The plot is intricate, the acting is well done, but the plot is at a full stop due to the endless drone of talk talk talk that I really don't care about. The ending was surprising and did save the movie from a lower score, but I guess I will never understand why people think this is one of Tarentino's best movies and one of the better movies of all time.",4,2,5,21 June 2007
Inside Man," Clever, Original, and fun!
","I went into this moving not really knowing what to expect. From the previews, it seemed like a typical bank robbery movie, so I was expecting more of the same. Boy was I wrong! 'Inside Man' is definitely one of the more original psychological thriller movies I've seen in a while! The beginning of the movie starts off like any other heist movie, but it quickly veers away from the standard movies in that genre after the opening scenes. I won't spoil too much of the story here, so I'll just talk about the various merits of the movie below.The acting was SUPERB! But then again, that's what one expects with acting powerhouses like Jodi Foster, Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and Chris Plummer. I wish Jodi Foster's character was expanded more, as she plays the 'mysterious but powerful woman' role extremely well in this movie. The mind games that Denzel and Clive play were very well developed throughout the movie, as each is trying to outsmart the other (well, more like one trying to figure out the other). At the end, I just wish we knew a bit more about each of the characters and see them more developed. That is the reason why I give this movie a 9 instead of 10, because it's more about the characters playing a story out than letting us learn more about each of them and who they are.I think most of the credit must be given to Spike Lee and Russell Gewirtz, the director/writer team, for coming up with such a new spin on bank robbery movies. Throughout the movie, I was just guessing what would happen next, and thinking like Denzel's detective character in the movie. The style of flashing back and forward in time was also very well done, adding complexity to the movie without giving the story away (even though it may seem like it at first).The only gripe I have about the movie is the lack of explanation of the motives of the bank robbery. Maybe it was left out intentionally to be consistent with the mysteriousness of the entire movie, but I believe it would have made the movie stronger than it is now.All in all, a great movie, so go check it out!",9,2,3,4 April 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Brilliantly original movie!
","Wow! Now this is one of the most original movies that I have seen in a long time! Normally I really do not like watching Will Farrell in any movie (except for Mugatu in Zoolander), but he really impressed me in 'Stranger Than Fiction'! The acting was first rate in this movie, with supporting characters like Robert DeNiro, Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah. Will Farrell surprisingly held his own against these heavyweights and together, they carried out the very clever and suspenseful script to perfection. This film really threw me off as it is a very witty comedy, as well as a powerful drama and a potential tragedy (I won't spoil the ending). At points I wasn't sure whether to cry or laugh at the scene, and that is something that very few movies have been able to do to people. The script was very poetically written, considering it is mainly about a famous author's description of an every day guy.Thus, with all these great aspects of the film coming together (acting, script, directing, humor), it made for an exceedingly impressive movie in which I may consider giving a 10 upon a 2nd viewing in the future. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a truly fun, original, and well executed film!",9,3,6,3 December 2006
Step Up," Good Dancing, ignore the plot
","Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clichéd, and I could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. But, the dancing sequences were VERY well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which I enjoy watching). The music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the 'drama' scenes more bearable. The leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were OK as actors, but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing.All in all, a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences, and this movie is MUCH MUCH MUCH better than 'You Got Served' in terms of the plot and drama. Then again, that doesn't say much, does it? =P",4,31,47,29 January 2007
Casino Royale," Great Bond movie at last!
","The best Bond movie I've seen (granted, I've only seen the more recent ones with Pierce Brosnan) so far. Amidst the doubt and attacks, Daniel Craig showed everyone that a blonde Bond can actually be fun, sexy, and exciting to watch. After 20+ films over the past few decades, this film reveals how James Bond became an agent and his early days. Some of the best lines include: Bartender: 'Shaken or Stirred', Bond: 'Who cares?' (or something like that).The acting was good, plot suspenseful, and action was of course very exciting. Having poker as one of the main plot line doesn't hurt either (one of my current favorite hobbies)! So whether you're a 007 franchise fan or not, check out the movie, you will find it very enjoyable!",8,2,5,3 December 2006
Munich," Emotionally Exhausting
","Alright, this review is written a little more than 2 weeks after I saw it. Why is that? Well, I needed some time to digest the movie and decide whether I liked it or loved it. A side trip to the actual city of Munich didn't hurt either .With that said, I believe the movie was a very well made, well thought out, and well acted piece of work. Steve Spielberg shows us again that he is not only great at action/sci-fi spectacle movies like 'War of the Worlds' (yes, I liked that movie, so there! ) but he's also a genius at movies that explore very touchy issues like in 'Munich'. The only thing is, emotionally I wasn't as engaged as I should have been with this movie. That is the reason why I can only give 'Munich' an 8 instead of a 9 or 10 like many other critics out there. I guess that's what differentiates one movie critic from another. They might all agree that a movie is very well made, but how much emotional impact they get from the movie will differ, and thus the varying ratings for the same movie.OK, enough babbling. Let's get on to the review! At the heart of the movie is a semi-fictional story about the details of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre of the Israeli athletes by the Palestinian terrorists, and the endless cycle of revenge and retribution that follows. All credit must be given to Spielberg for presenting as balanced of a viewpoint as one can of this messy situation, for he does not favor either side of the conflict, and allows the audiences to make the decision for themselves.What is most interesting and powerful in the movie is the story of one man (played by Eric Bana) who has to lead a small group of assassins to exact revenge on those who planned the massacre, and all the emotional turmoil he and his team have to experience throughout their mission. Eric Bana played the lead character's part with masterful skill and subtlety. He is at first happy for revenge, but as the mission goes on, his beliefs are challenged and the killings start to become a burden on his soul. It is watching this slow transformation and development of Bana's character that fascinates me the most about the movie. I believe Bana's performance should warrant an Oscar nomination, but in a year where there are so many great performances by a male lead, it'll be a toss up.As usual, the cinematography and action of the movie were very powerful and realistic, and I expect nothing less from Spielberg. The only problem I have with the movie is near the end, when there seemed to be multiple endings, one after another, similar to 'Memoirs of a Geisha' or 'Return of the King.' While I understand the need for these endings to provide closure to the story, I found myself wondering 'when will this movie end?' a couple times watching it. It's a very small gripe for such a good movie, but I just wanted to point it out.In conclusion, 'Munich' was a very well directed and acted film with a LOT of poignant themes involved. Even with my slight emotional detachment from the movie, I still strongly suggest you to see it. It'll definitely make you think and leave you emotionally exhausted.",8,2,3,9 February 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," Brilliant performance by Will Smith!
","A very standard 'rags to riches' story that is lifted to another level by the absolutely masterful performance by Will Smith. Of course, being filmed in the SF Bay Area definitely brings the story 'home' that much more.'Pursuit of Happiness' is about a very poor family with a 5 year old kid trying to survive in a big city. Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a smart man who for some reason or another (wasn't explained in the movie), never achieved all the dreams he went out to achieve. Instead, he's stuck selling medical devices that nobody wants and barely surviving with his wife (played by a very good Thandie Newton) and son (Jaden Smith, Will's real life son). Without going into a summary of the movie, the 'Pursuit of Happiness' explores what has happened to the idea of the 'American Dream' and the famous guarantee that all Americans have the right to 'life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness'.The plot is predictable, some parts were 'cheesed' up for dramatic effect. The social commentary about the rich-poor divide and homelessness issues are also valuable. But overall, you really appreciate the father-son interactions (definitely helped by being real life father and son) and all the sacrifices that a parent has to make to provide for a better living condition for their kids. It is also a story about one of the few who 'made it' in our modern world pursuing a better life. If not for Will Smith, this movie would just fade into the drowning roar of 'inspiring movies', especially during this Oscar season. But I now firmly believe Will Smith to be one of the premier young(ish) actors out there and am truly impressed by the acting range he had in this movie.Definitely recommended in this holiday season!",8,1,3,26 December 2006
V for Vendetta," One of the most thoughtful and chilling graphic novel movies I've seen!
","Movies derived from comics and graphic novels have just been getting better and better with each movie that comes out! Thinking back to the horrible movies such as 'Fantastic Four', 'Batman and Robin', or even 'Daredevil', I sure am glad that we have movies like 'Batman Begins', 'Xmen' (and 'X2'), 'Sin City', and now 'V for Vendetta' to balance things out! Out of all the good comic movies, the topic that 'V for Vendetta' explores is the most profound, deep, and frightening. 'Xmen' comes close with its topics, but 'V for Vendetta' brings it up a notch and shows you a world where everything goes wrong and Hitler like maniacs have used fear to create a totalitarian state. The movie explores everything from fear-based politics to terrorism to propaganda to government conspiracy to vigilantes to the true meaning of patriotism to love to revenge to prejudice and racism, all in a very coherent story line and all portrayed very well.This is a movie that gets everything right, so let's briefly go through each element.Acting: Natalie Portman is superb in this movie, transforming from a innocent and weak victim in the beginning to a hardened and fearless rebel in the end. The changes are subtle yet powerful to behold, and only someone with her acting chops can pull it off. Even though Hugo Weaving (and the actor who played the part before whose name I don't remember), who plays 'V', is behind the mask for the entire movie, he exudes the essence and personality of 'V' perfectly with every head tilt, hand gesture, or body movement. People have said that the most difficult type of acting is one where you cannot use any part of your face, and Hugo did a great job with it.Cinematography/Directing: The mood is dark, and England is under a totalitarian state. Each and every scene in the movie reminds us of this and the atmosphere is consistent throughout. Clips of 'fear' based news stories are peppered throughout the movie to relay to the audience how the people in Britain lived during those times. The story is very plausible, considering what is going on with our world today (and if you watched 'Why We Fight', it's even more frighteningly possible!), and all the humor, darkness, tragedy, frustration, hope and hopelessness is weaved expertly into the tapestry that is this movie.Action: While this movie has a lot of dramatic moments, the action is elegantly captured by the fight scenes involving the character 'V'. He has super-human strength and reflexes, and the choreography takes what we saw in 'The Matrix' up even a notch, adding beauty and artistry into the moves. I believe action fans would be quite impressed by those scenes in the movie.Finally, those of you who read my reviews know that I don't give out 10's to movies that easily, but after thinking about the movie, seeing what it represents, what it stands for, and how all the technical elements of film-making is put together, I must give this movie a 10 in my book, as it is every bit as fun, exciting, powerful, and thoughtful as 'Batman Begins' (one of my top movies of 2005), if not more. I only hope this trend continues with 'X3', coming out this May with another powerful social message, and we shall see if any other movies in the year can top this first big movie of 2006!",10,1,3,21 March 2006
