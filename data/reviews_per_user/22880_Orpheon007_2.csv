The Expendables 2," This is pure crap
","This movie was really awful, I mean it's a non-stop non-sensical over- the-top macho movie with a lot of silly and wasted jokes, forced storyline (if there's any) and lots of cameos and stupid one-liners and references to other movies these actors have made.Yes, there's Stallone, Van Damme, Li, Norris, Schwarzennegger, Statham and some others who I really don't care, they all appear, shoot - they do that a lot- and curse all along, you see explosions here and there, retarded action for retarded people, people, who claims that this movie is entertaining and funny, oh God, forgive them, and they say that the jokes were funny, I didn't hear any...It's insulting that this movie has a 7.7 ranking in IMDb, this is really a crappy effort to bring all these action movie stars back, almost all they look old and seem out of place for this movie, OK, people wanted them back, but that's not an excuse to make this look as a good movie.This is crap, so it should be treated like crap because it's even boring, seeing so much shooting and explosions gets really tedious, and it keeps going like that for soooooo loooooong. And people compares this to Avengers, WHAT??!! Avengers was by far better than this bull crap, it wasn't intense, it didn't get you into the story nor did manage to make the characters likable, so that comparison it's just plain stupid.See anything else, if you saw the first and found it lame, this is the same, but with 'better' effects and 'storyline' and 'funny' jokes, so it's really a waste of time, even if it's only 1 and a half hours.The only thing that I could say it was cool, was Jet Li and Statham's fight scenes, those were cool, over the top of course, and Li only appears in the beginning...",1,40,66,24 August 2012
Cloverfield," Good CGI Effects
","That's all what made this movie kinda entertaining, the Good CGI use of the monster and Special effects, but more than that, this was regular acted movie, it was filmed with a Hand-held camera to give some realism to it, and somewhat worked, it's maybe a difficult genre to keep.The Sound effects were great and the Monster's roar was incredible, but there were little action scenes and the party scene went far long.The only remarkable moments were the Militia opening fire against the monster, the Brooklyn bridge being destroyed and the scene were the monster gets attacked by bombs.All in all, it was a short action packed film with good visual and sound effects without score, except for the 'Roae' theme played at the credits.",8,0,1,13 August 2010
