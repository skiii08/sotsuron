Meet Joe Black," Beautiful and terrible life at the same time.
","Good movie. An excellent cast, especially good as always Hopkins. The film shows what a beautiful and terrible life we have at the same time. The film is a little tightened and did not have enough negative emotions (too many positive personages in the movie). The film is overly romantic.

Parasite," Korean movie
","An interesting and unusual plot. Excellent atmosphere. The film shows the hypocrisy and ingratitude of people.
