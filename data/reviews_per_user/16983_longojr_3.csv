3:10 to Yuma," Yumast be crazy not to watch this!
","This is not a standard western. This is an up-to-date story about human nature's self-recycling behavior. The outstanding characters who's ideology clash and cross against each other in a multidimensional roller coaster keeping insanity implosive and reserved like a Van Gogh's painting interact exchanging notions of their own unfulfilled, but challenging lives. Ironically, it is simply a great remake! And I am definitely not a fan of remakes although it seems life is a great remake with different actors and props. I would take at least an entire day to write about the main characters of this film. Pay attention to the dialogs! Details will help the action scenes make sense! The characters are not only moved by love and power! Only Peckimpah with his Cable Hogue to be compared with this one, or some of Kurosawa's! Shakespeare is not in love! And the main 'Citizen' is just like Cain (Kane) was to Abel inserted in a time-warp of unafraid actions, nonetheless, aware that human selfish behavior is the main consequence of circumstances, which sometimes can no longer be altered, simply by a mysterious need of existing, compelling and slowly altering without compromising oneself; hence the difficulty of some to comprehend such an astonishing film!",10,2,5,14 January 2008
Zodiac," Watch The Pink Panther instead
","Disappointing attempt for a great interesting subject. One of the greatest examples of wasted opportunities. A great cast with good dialog but simply too long. The result is a boring film where the director could simply blame editing for being lazy (I would not blame the editor for given up on this one!). Definitely not the same old good guy versus bad guy detective story; and for that perhaps one could try to watch it. I rather see the whole Inspector Clouseau series without any bathroom breaks, including the one with Alan Arkin instead of recommending this one. In sum, if you see it, bring Extra Strenght pills to avoid a Zodiache.Rotildo (a friend, not an enemy).",8,20,39,3 March 2007
Black Snake Moan," Prepare yourself and let it all out with the Blues!
","Here we go again folks! Another Saturday night double feature which I admit it made me feel as a triple feature, but there's good news and I'll get to that.Throughout the first half of this small marathon of 4 hours and 45 minutes dizziness was the main result, and for that I say do not get fooled by David Fincher's previous works, Seven or Fight Club, and just try to avoid the 2 hours and 40 minutes of 'zodiache'; it simply hurts. Because of such a long dragging torture I will even spare any comments of the few good moments in the movie. So let's move on to the second part.I felt the night was heading towards an endless abyss of pain but suddenly a great surprise: bliss!!! I left the theater with the exact same feeling when I first saw Pulp Fiction back in 1994. The movie Black Snake Moan will be a new classic. The ones who know me might watch the movie and think that the 'music' influenced my decision to write with such emotion about it, but I guarantee you that I never had the intent to fool anyone by getting mixed feelings about my personal taste and the admiration for art (although this statement can be tricky, I understand). I try to be fair, and that's it. The story is about loving one another which seems cheesy or corny, but is just a sea of appetizers that floods ones' soul (note Tennessee after Katrina as background). The acting is the main course in the film. And again the similar feeling I had with Pulp Fiction it is due to the extraordinary performance of Samuel L. Jackson (note some parallels with both characters in both films). Here Jackson was given the main role, not a supporting, as his previous best work, and kicks ass! And that's not it! Finally I can shout to all four corners that one the best new coming actresses have nail it! Christina Ricci is superb as the southerner white trash Ray, again her best effort yet. Perhaps due to the great characters along the story, which all actors (John Cothran Jr, etc) embodied and gave their best as well, Ricci could 'let it all out', stressing and relaxing with a great sense of gravity (the blues can really be a soul healer). S. Epatha Merkerson repeats the same charm given in Lackawanna Blues and shines in her supporting role. At last, the great revelation was Orlando Bloom's cousin, Justin Timberlake. I mean, if you look at both, they are either cousins or the same person, kinda like in Adaptation, a double-imaginary-based on true events-Coehn Fargoish feeling anyway where was I? Yes, no restrictions in Timberlakes' casting.No matter if you are a blues lover, as long as you can be open-minded for this creative new-style love story, then satisfaction is guaranteed. By the way, choose the right theater to catch this movie; a good crowd will create an even greater sensation. Forget the matinée also and try the last show.I hope you can enjoy it as I did Rotildo",10,13,28,3 March 2007
