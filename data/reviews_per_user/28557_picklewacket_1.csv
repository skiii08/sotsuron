50 First Dates," A Real Surprise...
","When the movie starts out it is loaded with somewhat corny, low-end humor and obvious jokes for the simple-minded. One might even be tempted to initially walk away from it, groaning, that it is just another predictable Hollywood piece of fluff with cheesy jokes. But after the scene, where she first learns of her memory problem, this movie becomes an incredibly well done combination of near tear-jerking drama, and light-hearted humor. It does not end with everything becoming picture perfect and everyone living happily ever after, but ends with realism and happily ever after (which in my book is the best of both worlds). I'm glad I gave this movie a second chance. If I hadn't, I would have missed something great.",10,0,0,26 August 2004
