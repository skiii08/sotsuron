The Blair Witch Project," A Psycho-thriller better than any other!
","'The Blair Witch Project' is not so much a horror movie, but a film that delves into your mind and hits at those fears that haven't been envoked from you in a very long time. The dark woods will never be the same. That sound off in the distance can not be disregarded as the wind. You can't tell yourself you're just hearing things. And what you see is real, and not a misinterpreted, idle object.This movie is so amazing. With films like this, the shlock that Kevin Williamson pumps out should be banned. Williamson's 'grip on teens' doesn't do jack for the audiences watching The Blair Witch Project. The characters--which are simply some of the best and most able to be cared for--aren't 20 somethings with great vocabulary and total perfection. No, they're REAL. They are just like you and me. They're like friends you know at school. Or, they are you. And you are them. In the woods. Lost. Hearing those sounds in the far distance, and coming across those sights that will be burned into your mind forever.I hate 'trendy horror.' Movies like Scream, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, and The Faculty--along with many others--are some of the lowest forms of horror around. And so many other films with such potential follow them. The Mummy, for example, tried to be funny, taking after some of these films. The Mummy was a horrible movie. All these movies are so bad, but so many people like them. I can't see why. Now we've got another sickening teen-horror-comedy coming out called 'Teaching Miss Tingle.' First of all, it is a rip off of the amazingly gripping novel 'Killing Mr. Griffin,' by Lois Duncan. Second of all, it's predictable already. You know what's going to happen. And you know what the characters are going to be like. You will never connect with them. And the movie will be terrible.My point is that The Blair Witch Project is real. All of it is reality, in a fiction movie. The characters are real, the story is real, and the fear is real. Though the whole movie is fiction, you can't say that, or, 'It's only a movie' with this one. It's like reality, on film. And by the time Heather and Mike get to that old house--which is one of the most horrific scenes ever in horror history--you will feel their fear, and you will wish that you could save them. This is definitely the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was a lot like The Blair Witch Project. It scared you because you felt the realism in it. And like these movies, the next true horror movie will come many years later.I completely and totally recommend The Blair Witch Project. But don't watch it for the expected scares, but for it's psychological terror. And if you're going to see Blair Witch, PLEASE rent Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It is just as good, if not better.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
Se7en," Ruthless
","Every time I heard about Se7en, I heard about the shocking ending. Finally, I rented it, not wanting to find out about the ending somewhere else. (Which, I found out when it came, I already knew from an MTV Movie Award spoof [damn them]). But I must say, I was still shocked and terrified.
Detective Somerset (Freeman) is nearing the end of his career as a detective when he is assigned to the case of some gruesome murders, with rookie detective Mills (Pitt). As Somerset and Mills continue a helpless investigation, it becomes evident that the murders are based on the Seven Deadly Sins, and the two detectives must fight to stop this killer before he strikes again..and again...and again.A ruthless, bleak movie. I was numb by the end of it. For the most part, towards the beginning, the only thing that distinguished this from any other detectives-after-a-serial-killer movie (which there are far too many of) was how gruesome the murders were, and the fact that the primary female character, in this film Mill's wife Tracy (Paltrow), wasn't sent to stay with her mother halfway into the film. The murders themselves were quite disgusting, one guy being fed spaghetti until he died (which can either be sort of silly, or just downright disgusting) and one woman whose face was cut off, and then, while still alive, given the option of calling the police and living with a disfigurement, or overdosing on sleeping pills and putting herself out of her misery. All of this is implied after the fact, but it's still just as terrifying, and just as revolting. The acting is all quite impressive, especially from Morgan Freeman, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey, who played the killer. Brad Pitt was alright; I didn't expect much from him, other than long spouts of profanity, which he allowed to the audience countless times. As for the climax...it was as shocking as reputated. I can't give anything away, but it was extremely well-written, especially in the final outcome, and also extremely tragic, and tragic only for how much the audience wouldn't have wanted the truth of the climax to be so. But those were some of the most tense scenes, leading up to the delivery. I could barely sit still. And after the movie ends, you're only left to think and be shocked.I do recommend this, but only for those who can handle such a bleak, tragic, brutal movie. If anything, it's one to be seen to be believed.",Null,0,0,22 April 2000
Alien," An Amazing Film of Horror and Sci-Fi
","I absolutely love this movie. From the great plot, to the  slowly growing tension, to the great acting, this film is a masterpiece in itself that is not to be missed.The ship Nostromo is moving quite well through the galaxy, the crew in deep slumber. They are then awoken by the contact of a planet (I think, I don't remember), and they investigate. One crew member is attacked by a face-hugging creature, and it seems as if he will be okay, until that night, during dinner. A baby alien rips out of his stomach and flees (in a sort of funny scene) and hides out in the ship, waiting to attack. The remainder of the crew, scared and unsure, go about finding this thing, and as it begins to kill, it starts to grow, bigger and bigger, until it is a human-sized creature, and able to rip prey apart in seconds. As it does, over and over, until Ellen Ripley is left to battle it and escape with her life.This really is a great movie. Sigourney Weaver has a hell of a lot of talent, and she displays it quite well in this. She truly is one of the best heroines of the horror genre, along with Marilyn Burns (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Eaten Alive) and Jamie Lee Curtis. She's tough, smart, and has a great scream. (Especially in the end, during the final battle with the alien in the escape pod.) The ending ten or fifteen minutes are tense, without a doubt, with dark, narrow tunnels and loud noises and blowing steam. My favorite scene is when Ripley is trying to override the detonation of the ship. That is the single most suspenseful scene in the movie, because Mother is counting down the time, and the process's steps are taking too long, and when, inevitably, time runs out, Ripley has the best reaction. (Smashing a computer consul and screaming to Mother, 'You bitch!!')
I don't need to even say that I recommend this movie. You know you have to see this movie, if you haven't. I have yet see Aliens (why, I don't know!!) but I can't wait, especially for the 'Get away from her, you bitch!' scene, which I did see, and loved.",Null,0,1,26 April 2000
North by Northwest," One of Hitchcock's Best
","I am a huge Hitchcock fan, and compared to some of his others including the mind-numblingly dull 'Suspicion' or the messy 'Rebecca,' this one shines, along with 'Psycho' as one of his best films. Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, a New York businessman who is suddenly thrust into a conspiracy that plots him as a killer. With no one to trust, and no one who believes him, he goes on the run, fleeing deeper and deeper into the mystery and the peril. On a train to Chicago one night, he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a steely blonde who he becomes involved with both romantically and in this plot against him. The lives of the two intertwine continuously through the rest of the chase, where the characters and plot twist like a winding mountain road, which is a perfect analogy for this movie, which climaxes on Mt. Rushmore, in one of the most gripping, suspenseful climaxes Hitch has ever directed.This truly is a great movie, in all ways. The music is appropriate and extremely well-fitting, and is in second to the theme of 'Psycho' as the best music in a Hitchcock film. The acting is totally on par, especially by the two stars. The chemistry between the two of them on the train is perfect, and adds to the list of memorable pieces of this movie, along with the famous cropduster scene (which had me cringing in fear) and that gripping, edge-of-your-seat, breathtaking climax on Mt. Rushmore. Hitchcock has never directed a climax as good as that. This is his best, second being the gasp-inducing climax to 'Psycho.' I loved the way the character of Eve Kendall changed so many times, and twisted and turned. At first she appears to just be that girl that will end up by Thornhill's side the whole movie, then she becomes the double-crossing spy, but then she double-crosses the enemies, and we realize so much more about her, that she becomes the most versatile character in the film, played to honest perfection by Eva Marie Saint. And also to mention was the very creepy-looking Martin Landau in a smaller role as one of the spies. Just the look in his eye made him a great antagonist. This really is a great movie, and as I said, one of Hitchcock's best. Hitch really came a long way from his minimal British productions, all of which seemed to look and feel the same. This is definitely one of the best chase movies around, and has remained as powerful as it was when it first came out.",Null,3,4,25 June 2000
Aliens," Amazing Sci-Fi Horror
","I saw the original 'Alien' not too long ago, and I loved it. I thought the story was strong, the acting was excellent, and the scares were great. I kept hearing, though, that the sequel was almost superior to the original. Finally, I rented 'Aliens' and checked it out. And I must say, I was impressed.Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the only survivor of the Nostromo, the ship from the original film, has been found floating around in a space pod, in a deep sleep. The ship that finds her takes her in, and the crew helps her recuperate, hoping to  find out what happened. Soon, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) proposes she use her expertise on a mission to a desolate planet where a colony of humans has appeared to have been wiped out by aliens similar to those in the original. Ripley reluctantly agrees, and joins the crew on a mission to the planet, whose only survivor is Rebecca 'Newt' Jordan (Carrie Henn), a little girl that the crew finds early in their arrivlal. What then unfolds is a nightmare that Ellen and the crew were never prepared for, as the aliens close in on them, and all hell breaks loose.The movie keeps a great pace, despite a small stumble towards the middle that almost makes the movie sort of tedious in the desperate 'What the hell are we going to do?' situation the surviving handful of crew members are put in. But the action is well-done, and there is amazing suspense, particularly in the scene where the two face-huggers attack Newt and Ripley in the bedroom, and the whole final ten of fifteen minutes of the movie. Some of the early killings get rid of characters you never even connect with, and the scenes are so wild, you don't even know who got killed. Those the audience does identify with are quite interesting, and most are likable, especially Ripley. The climax is absolutely wild, and is there much better a line than, 'Get away from her, you bitch!'? One of my favorite parts was in the end, when Ripley opens the hatch to release the queen alien, and it grabs her and tries to pull her down with it. And Ripley gives off this chilling scream that was so terrifying, I had to watch the scene a second time. The music is effective and at times, absolutely perfect. And the acting...such great acting. Sigourney Weaver deserved the Oscar. She was amazing, from start to finish, and I couldn't help but cheer for her the whole time. The way she gave Ripley real emotion and personification is rare in horror films today, as many heroines come off as just 'goody-goody' or too tough. I really hope she shows up more in the horror genre. Carrie Henn was actually not very annoying, as most child actors are. She was a likable little girl. Paul Reiser was great, and like Bill Paxton, quite funny at times. Lance Henrikson, Michael Beihn, and Jenette Goldstein rounded out the stars of the movie, and each did quite well in their roles. The rest of the characters I sort of lost track of. This is a great movie, and despite it getting a bit monotonous in the middle, it really is worth a look, and deserves the reputation it still has today.",Null,0,0,28 May 2000
The Exorcist," Well, hmm....What to say...
","Don't you hate when you really love a movie, and you think it's amazing and enthralling, and then read a really negative review for it? Doesn't it make you think, 'Oh, what do you know!'? That's what it does to me. For example, I'm a huge 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' fan, and I hate when people say it's a cheesy b-movie about a guy with a chainsaw chasing some dumb blonde who can't stop screaming. That's NOT all that movie has to offer.
What's my point?Well, I am just saying that so you won't be angered when I say  I didn't like 'The Exorcist.' (In other words, I can appreciate the movie for what it is, so don't think I'm being mean.) I mean, there were some scary parts, yes. Well, creepy parts, at least. But the pace was so slow, and took it's damn time to get going!There were some okay points. Some atmosphere. The suspense was built well when the screams of the devil would be coming from Regan, and Chris would run to check to see what the hell was going on. And the ending was pretty good. But there are a lot of bad points. To me, not a lot was explained. What was the point of the first ten minutes, in Iraq? I honestly didn't get it. And why was Regan being possessed? I just wasn't seeing the connection in some things. And how did her head spin around, and her neck not break? And if it did, how could she still be alive by the end? (That is not a spoiler! We all know there's a sequel, with Regan.) Sure, some of you may think, 'You think 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'is a great movie, what do you know about cinema?!' But that's a battle of what is scary and what isn't.A few more comments would go to the possessed Regan's almost comic demeanor. Her devilish self said a lot of funny things, and was pretty amusing. Still, Linda Blair did a good job in her role, and was impressive. Ellen Burstyn was a bit hammy at times, but still quite strong and moving. Jason Miller did quite well in his role, and I thought he did quite well. And of course, the music was pretty good, if a bit sparse in showing up, and it seemed to show up all of the sudden, then fade off really quickly. I think this could have taken the 'Halloween' approach and used it's great music for some much needed atmosphere at the dull scenes. (And there are many.)Still, to be a true horror fan, I guess you have to see this movie, so I do recommend it. To see if you like it. And if anything, there's always 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' a true experience in unrelenting terror.",Null,4,6,28 May 2000
Rear Window," One of the Most Thrilling Films Hitchcock Ever Directed
","I saw this last night on AMC and was blown away by the plot, the characterization, the setting, and of course, the suspense. I am a huge Hitchcock fan, some of my favorites being 'North by Northwest,' 'Psycho,' 'Lifeboat,' and now this. L.B. Jefferies, known as Jeff by his friends, is wheelchair-bound in his Manhattan apartment, dealing with a broken leg. With nothing else to do but look out the window, he takes to watching the lives of his neighbors around the center courtyard: the struggling musician, Miss Torso, the dancer, the eccentric couple with the curious dog, the newlyweds, Miss Lonelyheart, and of course, the Thorwalds, right across the way. Lars Thorwald and his bed-ridden wife become Jeff's focal characters to observe...until Mrs. Thorwald disappears, and Lars becomes progressively suspicious. He quickly involves his uptown girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly) who opts to do some investigation, and then involves his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Helpless in his apartment, he works through them and the moderate help from his friend, Doyle (Wendell Corey), a detective. Questions continue to arise, and Jeff, Lisa, Stella, and Doyle seem to be coming to a conclusion. Yet, this is Hitchcock, and our team of protagonists aren't close to just solving the case and moving on. Oh no, the last twenty minutes or so prove to unbearably suspenseful as Lisa investigates the Thornwald's apartment while it's unoccupied, and Jeff and Stella watch helplessly as Lars comes home....This truly is an amazing film. James Stewart and Grace Kelly give amazing performances, and Thelma Ritter is wonderful as the witty nurse. The vignettes on the lives of each of Jeff's neighbors are all quite interesting, and I found Miss Lonelyheart's story in particular to be absolutely wonderful. I also loved how Jeff was helpless, while the two women were off doing what one would think to be the man's role in the movie. Lisa, particular, is quite an innovative character. First of all, she's very funny. I love when Jeff is telling her the rough aspects of a traveling photographers life, and how when he asks her something in the way if she had ever been 5000 feet up, struggling to stay warm in twenty below zero weather, and she replies, 'Well, when I get a few minutes after lunch....' She also takes that role of the elegant uptown girl and admits her sophistication and perfection, like when Jeff comments on how she never wears the same dress twice, and Lisa notes light-heartedly, 'Only because it's expected of her [me].' And then, when she takes all those risks to uncover the truth in the end. Not only could I not sit still, I was so scared (which is rare for me with most horror movies) but I was amazed at how she proved that she wasn't afraid to risk anything. Now, that's one hell of a heroine, and perhaps the greatest Hitchcock woman ever.I also loved Stella. She had some of the greatest lines in the movie, and I love when she's commenting to Lisa and Jeff on the probable gory details of Lars's act. She was definitely memorable with all her witty lines, and had me laughing many times.And of course, James Stewart gave a great performance, conveying that feeling of helplessness, and near claustrophobia being in that apartment, unable to do anything, and just as he's safe in his apartment watching everyone, he goes through hell trying to figure out what to do when Lars comes home while Lisa is still at his apartment. The movie is enthralling from the amazing opening to the wonderful epilogue, and the title music totally sets the scene for some fun. I recommend this movie to anyone, it is an amazing film.",Null,5,8,17 July 2000
