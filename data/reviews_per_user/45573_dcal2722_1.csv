The Monuments Men," Could Have and Should Have Been A Great Movie...But...
","This story has the potential to be a 'Great Movie' telling the true story of the Allies efforts to recover and secure Europe's artistic treasure's. The story itself is intriguing and all that was really required was the establishment of the central character's with a bit of care and detail. This was not accomplished by Clooney's directorial leadership in the telling of this story. I suppose I should say that as an actor George Clooney is a current 'standout' within the acting community. As a Director, George Clooney is a novice whose work lacked rhythm, pace and direction. As stated, this should have been a truly great movie based on the material that was available to the producer and the director in that it is taken from actual WWII experiences of real people during the most compelling period in modern history. This was a time in which average men and women became larger than life heroes with stories that are just waiting to be told... competently and with care.",6,0,0,5 May 2014
