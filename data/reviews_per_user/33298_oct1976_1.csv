Kill Bill: Vol. 2," just a word to the critics
","i just saw vol.2 last night and i was thoroughly entertained and happy with the way it ended. the thing that i find funny is not the movie at all but those who trash this film. i mean unless youre paid for your review why bother seeing a sequel to a movie you didnt like? i can understand a new movie but if you didnt like vol.1 then whats the point? i hated jeepers creepers so i knew i wasnt going to like the second installment. i think the people who bagged on this film just wanted to for the sake of being different. irritable malcontents who only have negative things to say because they are so miserable they need to whine as loud as they can to get attention. its sad really. im not saying you had to like the kill bill movies, but lets face it. you only watched the second one because you wanted to rip on it. and this is just my opinion but, if you didnt dig these films then maybe its just because you didnt get it. i thought the second film was the perfect way to end the story. i felt the direction was perfect. due to his editing style tarentino lets you know how things end before they begin and still he manages to build suspense. thats talent. where the first film was a fast paced kung fu film this one is more of a intense nail biting western. it lives up to and beyond the hype.",Null,0,1,17 April 2004
