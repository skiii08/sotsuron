First Man," First Man To Bored Me Near Dead
","A family drama about the first man on the moon, correct but boring, a lot of frames show us him and a voice saying numbers and things we don't understand.The problem whit this story is the main character (based on a real person) it's the less interesting man on the universe, cold, smart and a man of few words.Only recomend if you love space movies or the space carrer between USA and Soviet Union.",6,0,0,4 November 2019
