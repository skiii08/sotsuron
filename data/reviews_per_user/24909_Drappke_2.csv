Requiem for a Dream," The first movie I've seen with school that is simply great.
","Today, we went to see Requiem for a dream with school... We all had a couple of jokes throughout the movie, but at the end, there was a dead silence. I sat in my chair, and looked at the screen and didn't blink. I turned my head, looked at my fellow-students and noticed I wasn't the only one. Everyone was greatly impressed by this movie. As we were walking back to school, I saw some people who were really shocked by this movie, judging from their pale faces... Damn this is the first movie I've seen with school that really sticks to my mind.",10,0,1,6 November 2003
Akira," The best Movie based on a comic book ever... (sorry spiderman)
","I bought the DVD because I read some of the comic books, that my friend bought. The story was like the mother of all sci-fi manga... It really blew my socks off, I had to have the DVD. The details are the best I have ever seen in an Anime movie. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie, is that is it too short. Like Lord of the rings, the story is too big to fit in one movie, why oh why didn't they do like Peter Jackson and made 3 these films.",8,0,2,23 October 2003
