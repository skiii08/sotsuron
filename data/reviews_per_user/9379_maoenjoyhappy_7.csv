50 First Dates," Making each day count
","Henry, who lives in a Hawaiian paradise, accomplishes a fateful encounter with beautiful woman, Lucy, at a restaurant. The next day, he tries to deepen the relationship, but Lucy can't recognize him on account of her short-term memory. After he finds out the fact, he pours his energy into her in the face of adversity. This film is deep love story but not described in a serious way, also in a comical and humorous way.Henry's love toward Lucy is pure and his figure of making a marriage propose to her everyday without quitting is touching and very masculine. Also, by using a video to keep her memory clear is a brilliant idea and is a measure how much Lucy is valued and loved by Henry and around her company. The way of her family to protect memory-loss Lucy, which they pretend as if the day hasn't proceed since she gets into an accident, might be viewed as too much at times, but her family literally cherishes her from bottom of their heart.From this film, I figure out that we need to spend a day without regret, we'll never know what would become of us the next day.",6,1,1,5 August 2017
Midnight in Paris," Intoxicated with scenery of Paris
","Gil, an engaged successful screenplay writer of Hollywood but struggling as a novelist, spends time in his beloved country Paris with his fiancé, Inez and her parents. Walking around at midnight by himself, he is seduced by some passengers of an old car to ride. Surprisingly, he slips back in time to the golden age of 1920'. Then Paris draws him ardently more and more My first impression on this film is what a beautiful streetscape Paris is. The sound and the scenery match perfectly and never fail to fascinate us even though the first a couple of minutes show us just the view of Paris. No wonder why Gil is obsessed with Paris and so am I about to be. What I literally interested in is that so many famous artists and writers in 20' such as Picasso, Dali, Hemingway and Fitzgerald show up on a sudden. The relationship between them is depicted in a comical way. At first, it seems that it is just the time slip film, but it is more valuable to watch it. After watching this, you must be overwhelmed by the Paris scenery and must hold a feeling that you want to fly to Paris!",8,0,0,5 August 2017
Now You See Me," Unfailingly deceived by the Four Horsemen
","FBI Agent, Dylan, and an Interpol Detective, Alma, track down a stirring up magicians, The Four Horsemen, who robbed a bank during a show, to unwrap grandly deceptive tricks. From a support of a professional illusion teller, Thaddeus, it seems that they figure out all the tricks, but unclear who is a key figureThis film allures theaudience completely how they do an impossible magic trick. Inparticular, the first scene of trump magic, the drawn card numberappears on the tower of entire window. Each member of The Four Horsemenhas different types of techniques, and this characteristic entertainsus more and more. Their spectacular magic makes us a second viewingpossible to enjoy. Many foreshadowing are filled in the story and themastermind is unclear to the very end and that one is totally indescribably unexpected figure. You'll never get tired of watching it. I haven't watched the second episode yet, so I can't wait to watch it and never fail to betray our expectation.",9,0,0,5 August 2017
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Can't hold back tears in the end
","During WWâ…¡, Bruno from a wealthy family, whose father is a German soldier, moves to the countryside in Germany where a concentration camp for Jews is back yard to his house. When exploring around his house secretly, he meets a boy dressed in a striped pajama, Shmuel. They are good on terms little by little... and they attempt to conduct an irreversible matter. One thing that I am relieved is that not everyone in Germany agrees with taking part in the WWâ…¡, even the top military's relatives as well. Also, it proves that children don't care about their race and background. This needs to be taught to adult at once seriously. This film is one of the best and touching ones that I have ever seen before in regard to WWâ…¡. You'll never expect the ending literally and the story goes on making us breathless all the time. I would like people in the world to watch this and this will be helpful to change a way of thinking concerning war and discrimination.",10,0,0,5 August 2017
Selma," How King.Jr changed the world...
","Martin Luther King Jr., who is a black minister, calls for a vote rights of black people in Selma, Alabama. As he marches with black people collectively, the white attack violently black people. Resisting the white's violence, the black led by King Jr. expands civil rights movement to the whole America including the white and the President Lyndon Johnson. Every single person in the world knows that King Jr. is the greatest and the most influential hero who approaches the world to indiscrimination. This film is depicted in detail how he stirs up the world little by little. When he speaks out in public, he is just viewed as an eloquent and brave figure; however, the film tells us that King Jr. is at times afraid of resisting his antagonists. In addition, some of the core members of demonstration decide who should be in the very front in marching by scissors-paper-stone. If I were in this situation, I would hope not to be the one in front to death. They are of course fearful for their action, but they end up with overcoming the fear. I believe that their brave must be respected and admired profoundly.",7,0,1,5 August 2017
The Terminal," Novarski's figure of living through anything
","Victor Novarski from the Eastern Europe, Krakizhia, arrives at JFK airport, yet he is turned down to get into the U.S.A. because his passport is invalid for his government's collapse. He makes a decision to live in the airport until the time is ripe and he meets several people working in the airport. Novarski isn't a good English speaker at all; however, he manages to communicate with American with rudimentary English and to find a way to earn a living by himself. This film proves that language is not the most important elements when we make a reliable relationship with people from different countries. If I were in the same situation as his, I am wondering how I would take a measure to live out in the airport, which is incredibly beyond description. This film is not included just how Novorski lives out in the airport, but also his love and comical factors, and the reason why he comes to the U.S.A all the way.",8,0,1,5 August 2017
The Social Network," Relationship or Money?
","Mark Zuckerburg, a student of Harvard University, who becomes famous for an opener of Facebook later on, is claimed by affluent two brothers that Mark steals their ideas and co-founder and Mark's best friend, Eduardo, sues Mark Before watching the film, I expect that the story will be successful how he has achieved the remarkable feat. However, in the film, his struggling points such as relationship with people and money are described. For instance, he is dumped by his girlfriend, Erica, in order to retaliate against her, he opens a bad site for the use of advantage of his programming ability. One interesting point is that the universally prestigious social network service, Facebook, which is to communicate with others all over the world, is created by a man who is not good at making a good relationship. Even if Mark Zuckerburg is one of the youngest millionaires in the world, he holds no true happiness. This shows that family bond and friendship are crucially significant rather than money.Yet, according to my search, not everything in the story is based on the true story. Seemingly before producing the film, though the director asks him to have an interview, the director is turned down. Actually, the story is unreliable to seize as Mark Zuckerburg's autobiography, but I believe that the film wants to convey a message to us that relationship makes our life.",5,0,0,5 August 2017
