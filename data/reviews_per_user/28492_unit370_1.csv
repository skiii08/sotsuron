The Avengers," How the new movie relates to the comic
","Avengers: Marvel At It's BestThe Avengers movie that came out this past summer was one of the best movies that has come out in the past few years. It was the much awaited superhero movie that would combine the movies of: Iron Man, Hulk, Captain American, and Thor. Although the Avengers was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time it was not perfect. The problem with most, if not all superhero movies is that there are so many different stories or universes; it is hard to pick which one to make the movie about. The Avengers movie proves this point by having different characters other than the ones that were in the original Avengers comic, which this movie is suppose to be about. The first team members of the Avengers consisted of the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and one that was not in the movie, Ant Man. The first Avengers comic was issued on September 10, 1963. Captain America does not even join the Avengers until the comic 'Avengers #4' issued in March of 1964. The plot of the Avengers movie was great; it does a good job of blending the new age of comics with the old. The movie kept the same plot as the first comic book, with Loki being the main villain. The one difference is the time period of which the battle takes place. In the comic it takes place in the 1960's, which makes sense since that was the time period it was written in, while the movie took place in modern time. Joss Whedon did a great job in converting the old out dated form of the Avengers into the new time period. He did this by adding modern military weapons like the F-35, as well as adapting the whole story to modern times by adding in space travel, GPS, and better computers, just to name a few. The actors that played in the Avengers movie by Joss Whedon each played their character very well. The one actor that really played his part well was Robert Downey Jr. He played the part of Tony Stark extremely well. His character is self centered, has an extremely large ego, and to top it off, he looks almost exactly like the comic book character. Another character that I thought did great job in this movie was Mark Ruffalo, who played the Hulk as well as Bruce Banner. The Hulk has been in two other movies other than the Avengers, and both movies have had different actor's portray the Hulk and Bruce Banner. The one in the Avengers was by far the best one they have had. The way Ruffalo played Banner was extremely close to way he is portrayed in the comic books. Banner is a confident scientist who is not only looking for a cure, but is also using his knowledge to help society. Unlike the other movies that portrayed Banner as being a scared, and work obsessed scientist who is only focused on curing himself. In conclusion The Avengers movie was an amazing culmination of all of the Marvel movies they have made up to this point. The way the director interlocked the stories and different movies gave everyone who watched them background information on the various heroes as well as the villains. Although the time period that the movie took place was different than the comics, the director did a great job in carrying over the key aspects of the comic. I would by far recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies, superheroes movies, as well as comics.",Null,0,2,16 November 2012
