The Equalizer," Great movie - but should be classed in Sci-Fi section
","I know this wasn't based on a true story, but the producer was silly to portray 1 ex-CIA operative to be able to take down an entire Russian mafia, AND take care of corrupt cops while stopping the occasional burglary at the local Home Improvement DIY.Robert McCall makes the SWAT team look like like the Rugrats. The movie started off incredible, the first 30mins were captivating, However the plot thickened, the film got progressively worse like a crescendo. It put Rambo to shame as it amassed weight on the 'bullshit scale'. At one point I really wondered whether the entire state really needed any more police, perhaps 1 Batman was enough.If you can watch this with an open mind where 'anything is possible' then this movie is great. If you're too analytical, then don't as you would be disappointment.",6,0,3,14 December 2014
Child 44," Good story, shoddy accents
","Don't waste your time on this, none of the actors or actresses were able to represent 10% of real Russian/Soviet accent. It was a shoddy and lame attempt by the entire cast which kept reminding me how stupid this movie became. It's a shame because if they used some real Russian actors, it would have been a decent plot but no, heavy & fake accents was the way to go by the director. At various points of the movie you can hear the accent drop off between sentences to be replaced with the native American accent. To top it all off, none of them even looked like Russians from the soviet eras besides the 2 hunks that were sent into the carriage to shank them.I love Tom hardy, but sorry, he's much better with the English accent in the movie Legend",4,0,1,28 August 2016
The Book Thief," Overrated - too many flaws
","I've watched many holocaust movies however this one was one of the worst ones i've seen. There were way too many 'BS' scenes and half-way through the movie I actually started to get quite bored.Firstly the 'attempted German' by Geoffrey Rush is horrible beyond repair. All due respects to him being a great actor, but casting him in this one was a fail. You sometimes catch him attempting German with a subtle American accent which mixed like oil and water. Apart from the frequent 'Ja!' (Yes) at the suffix of each sentence, His attempt was nothing short of terrible.The last 35mins of the film felt like the Producer and Director both nodded at each other in reference to sealing off this movie before it drags on like a game of boring tennis.What also annoyed me was the scene where Max (the Jew) walks out in the night during heavy bombings smiling to the Sky, while the locals all camped in basements. I'm yet to see any person actually perform this action in the act of warfare.Eitherway this film was flawed with bad (attempted) accent which rivaled John Travolta's Serbian accent attempted in Killing Season coupled with BS scenes and attempts while portraying a True Story. Watch the Pianist if you want a decent holocaust movie",4,7,12,5 March 2014
Justice League," Waste of time
","Very predictable movie, Batman goes out to recruit a group of superheroes to fight a massive opposing force from the depth of hell.
As always, the superheroes are found going about their daily business such as teaching at a school, listening to music or what have you. At first they think Batman is a moron and then they see the signs.
Finally after confronting this all-hell-breaking evil force, they realise they can only do it with Superman, but he's dead!
So with a solid twist to the movie, they gang up to resurrect him and out he comes full-swinging at this behemoth opponent, knocking him around like a rag doll. The End.",3,1,2,26 February 2018
The Revenant," Finally a great movie to end a drought
","I must say I had a bit of a biased (positive) feel to this movie prior to even seeing it. Leo and Tom are 2 of my favorite actors and they haven't failed in their previous performances to say the least.Getting on with the movie, the film throws you into the cold, dark wilderness of Canada. The captivating performance by Leo and the way the film was shot in low, natural light went hand in hand to really plunge your senses in this eerie and dangerous environment. I almost felt freezing cold on certain occasions because I was so immersed in the film.There were very minor let-downs in the movie such as the ease at how Leo ignited fires all the time despite blizzards, wind and him being soaked in cold water.Other than that, a great movie and well-worth watching",9,1,6,6 January 2016
Gone Girl," Boring and full of plot holes
","I won't list all the lousy plot holes this movie was embroiled in, but if you're looking for a suspense thriller like Mystic River or Prisoners, then stay away from this wreck.The entire story is logically impossible, a woman faking her own murder sparks an entire man hunt, she later pops up after her plan goes awry yet the police don't charge her for false and misleading information. Instead they still treat her like a victim.The police are all pretty stupid, the entire unit is taken on a roller coaster ride of lies, and fabricated fairy tales and yet they all seem to be wrapped.The dumbest scene was her faking her pregnancy by apparently siphoning water from a toilet after a pregnant lady had urinated. How can a hospital not tell the amount of dilution in the urine?.this film is full of bottom-shelf bullshit, illogical plans and unrealistic events.",5,2,5,26 December 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Leo's performance is great, the movie - you can give it a miss
","Let me start of with the basics, prior to watching this movie I heard the city of Dubai censored this movie down by ~40mins by cutting out rude scenes involving sex, nudity and so forth. At first I was rather flabbergasted at this opinion, however when I saw this movie last night, I realized they had every right to do so. Most of the scenes dragged on way beyond it's point where it started venturing near a soft porn clip.The movie will be much more enjoyable had it been a 2hr running time with 85% of the useless sexual references removed. If I wanted to see something as full-frontal I would have watched Eyes Wide Shut.To me it seemed the jump from the garage operated boiler-room to the full-blown office was slightly over expedited. We never got to see Jordan's 'lows'.Leo does a fabulous job with his performance however as the title suggests, I think the movie had better potential in many different ways.Final thought? If you're a Leo die-hard fan, watch it, otherwise be prepared for a soft-porno of drugs and sex.",6,8,14,27 January 2014
Kong: Skull Island," Giving it 4/10 for the CGI only
","It seems whenever a Chinese-based production company (Tencent Pictures in this case) gets its hands on a potential Hollywood motion picture, things go for the worse. Is Hollywood that bankrupt that it needs some financial support thrown in from Asia?The movie is a trash-fest, it would be much better if they made it into a 30-min short movie with only the Kong Vs Creature fights and cut the other BS.The movie begins with an ecstatic adventurer luring the US Army at helping him map out a mysterious island by dropping TNT randomly across the borders without even trying to see if there's human life there.This awakens Kong, a 100ft giant that starts swinging and hurling trees at the choppers, rather than turn back, the army defiantly try and shoot this thing using the same bullet calibre used for 6-7 Foot humans. During the silly battle, the backdrop seems to switch from Dusk/Sunset to perfectly clear daylight, this happens a number of times by the way.The clich√©s start drooping out like diarrhea with Samual L Jackson at the forefront of crappy acting (seems like he's just putting his hand up for any script thrown at him). Anyway, Mr Jackson is hell-bent at killing this massive monster because 'it killed his men' so he stubbornly goes against the team's pleas to stop despite the threats of even more dangerous creatures around.I won't go in anymore detail, but the goofiest scene was when the Photographer girl tries to lift a downed chopper (you read that right) to help a dying buffalo/bison. The fact that she tried to move a Chopper with her bare hands was mind-numbing, however, she also didn't notice the 100ft ape approach to help or feel the ground shake but was surprised in awe when the chopper began to rise and realised Kong is helping. Finally, there was a token Chinese girl in the movie who's supposed to be a biologist, she was as useful as a tree in the background, said nothing/did nothing, must have been a requirement for the funding.",4,1,2,27 June 2017
Arrival," The Arrival of boredom
","Ever watched a movie where up until the last 5 minutes you're anxiously hoping for something to develop? but then it doesn't? If not, Arrival has Arrvied. An absolute slug-fest of a movie which draws you to flashbacks and flash-forwards of Louise's life. Meanwhile an above-average smart scientist (Ian) does nothing except express faces of awe and finally admits that he's fallen for Louise. Meanwhile the Aliens arrive on some vessel that defies every law of physics and space, they also pretty much happen to be Squid that make noises which are a cross between a Whale and a mating Lion. Louise and Ian proceed to make 54 trips back and forth to the Vessel whilst communicating to these animals via an iPad, at the same time, the World Powers are just waiting on developments from these 2 douchebags else they will send in their tanks.The part that really annoyed me was that these Aliens had the knowledge to see future in 3,000 years, however neither of the 2 clown squids foresaw the future that a C4 bomb would be planted by some crazed soldier that would result in the death of one of them. It was the most unrealistic design of aliens, I think the producer was craving some Calamari when he thought of this.",3,16,31,18 February 2017
Godzilla," Where do I start??
","I watched this movie for 2 reasons: 1.) It's Godzilla, 2.) it received a good rating on IMDb. Whilst 1.) is non-negotiable, 2.) was an absolute farce.I'd like to point out some every very bad areas of this movie.The acting was horrid, I've seen better acting on TV Shows and Soap Operas, hell Jerry Springer hosts seemed more legit. Ice-Ts acting on CSI is even better The protagonist lacked any sense of emotion like he was a last decision on this set and forced into it by some cash incentive, most of the actors and actresses hardly showed any fear in a major mutant wrecking havoc in their city. Just look closely at the scenes where they're running away from the disaster and looking back and they just casually do so like someone's just yelled their name and told them they forgot their coffee on the sidewalk.There was a scene where the Tsunami was approaching fast and a father had his girl on his shoulders fleeing, whilst facing the tsunami behind, she looks casually on while her father scurries. I've seen girls her age scream their lungs out when splashed with some waves on the beach! Godzilla looked like he was created from a human template complete with boxing arms and a narrow buff chest ready to box. As many people pointed out, neither we (the viewers) nor the actors really knew which side Godzilla was supposed to be on, it was all over the place.I usually never comment on Sci-Fi movie facts as they're Sci-Fi, but common eating a Submarine and Missiles is very stupid...at least make it that they were hunting for raw uranium not a submarine hanging off a tree.Last of my vent is the the audio engineers need to be sacked and forced to work at Dunkin Donuts for the rest of their lives. Godzilla sounded like a string of (damaged) Electric Guitar being prolonged with the occasional lion/elephant morph, whilst the stupid insects sounded like gunfire in the background with an old car-horn. Needless to say it was stupid as insects don't have vocal chords.The first 20mins was the only decent run of this movie and the father was the only decent actor.",3,0,2,28 September 2014
Life," Ignore if you like space movies
","Usually movies on IMDb that are rated above 6.5 turn out to be good or acceptable, however a large bunch of brainless, space-fetish, under 20s rate it 10/10, you have no hope. This movie is classified as a sci- fi, so i'm not going to detest factual details surrounding the alien life-form. However if you wish to create something of an alien figure, please use your imagination and not the imagination of some calamari-hungry idiot that thought it would be great to have an 8-legged, slimy squid patrol the airship that can live with/without oxygen, and is flame retardant. This thing must have a weak point of some sort, but the producer left that part out and you're sort of wondering what other futile tricks the crew have up their sleeves. It was also convenient for the spaceship to lose all comms to earth the moment this seafood basket became hostile. The movie was just a trashy take on previous space movies with alien forms, all from the over-exaggerated acting of Ryan Reynolds to the token Japanese wizard who's just there because Sony Pictures want to make a statement concerning Japan.",4,0,1,9 July 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," An absolute turkey
","Ever wondered what a shitty version of Equaliser or Jack Reacher is? If not, then you may try John Wick 2. This movie is your typical Hollywood shitty and predictable movie, you can probably foresee the ending by just reading the synopsis and sparing 1 and a half hours. John Wick gets invited to join the mafia/group/ that he was once a part of, he refuses, so they shoot his house up to hell and stupidly leave him alive. The cops, nurses, hotel concierge and traffic controllers all know John Wick has been up to no good and understand his situation. He decides to unearth his weapons by hitting some foam blocks resembling concrete. He then proceeds to wreck havoc across half the country by killing multiple men with/without weapons. John Wick is untouchable, invincible and he cannot be killed, but the mafia keep throwing mindless thugs at him in the hopes one of them can calm him down, it obviously all fails for them and he gets what he wants in the end.",1,4,7,28 June 2017
The Martian," This film should be banned
","After watching Gravity and Interstellar, I was rather hungry for more space odyssey movies. I heard about the Martian some time later and simply counted down the days.My feeling of excitement soon turned to misery, boredom and eventually anger approximately 60 mins into the film when the 'bullshit meter' maxxed out. I started counting down the minutes for this trash-fest to end but later decided at 65mins to call it a night.Matt continued to torment the viewers with his inane jokes, and annoying selfie videos. His comments later degenerated when he started to 'take on' Mars as a sentient being by reminding himself that he's prepared to make water, oxygen, food, drone vehicles and weapons because he happens to be a mathematician, chemistry professor and botanist. Never mind the fact that a person stuck in space with extremely limited resources would have a sense of panic, stress and experience various nervous breakdown episodes, Matt continued to sing in the shower, and play disco music whilst longing for additional soundtracks.Not only did all his inventions of creating water and planting 100- year old dried potato work, but he happened to come across all his resources and materials needed for his inventions like strolling through Walmart. The entire episode made it look easier to be stuck in Mars with no food than an elevator",3,2,5,6 January 2016
Furious 7," The bullshit bucket has tipped over
","The (original) Fast and the Furious was a great movie, purely set on illegal racing, money and turf wars. By Fast and Furious 7, the movie franchise evolved into a Die Hard / Mission Impossible and Expendables type movie with more bullshit than all 3 movies above put together.I am actually ashamed by looking at the stats that: 48,262 people (or bots) voted this 10/10, followed by; 23,548 people (or bots) voted this 9/10. F&F7 is the same as F&F 6, or 5 or 4. The same recycled jokes, tacky quotes and cheesy personalities.None of the actors (or actresses) gave a performance strong enough to immerse you into the movie. As a result, you are left focusing on the bullshit unfold from a flying car enter between 3 tower buildings without hitting a concrete level, or Jason Statham randomly appearing between Abu-Dhabi, US, and various other regions where the F&F team have just rendezvoused.",4,1,15,24 May 2015
