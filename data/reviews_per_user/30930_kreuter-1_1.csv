The Benchwarmers," Horrible
","I have never felt compelled to comment about a movie on the internet. However, after seeing Bench Warmers I feel obligated to save any human-being from wasting an hour and a half of their life watching it. I'm a big fan of the whole cast and things they have done in the past, but this movie was and is pathetic. NOTHING about it works. The comedy is so cheap that I can't think of a way to describe it. you start to think that it's tongue in cheek or satirical, but then you can't figure out how or why. Worst movie I've ever seen in my life. And now I've been told that my comment isn't the required ten lines. The problem is that I am still so confused by what the director was trying to achieve in this flick that I don't know what to say. Unimaginative, flaky, very unfunny, boring, extremely predictable and a total waste of time.",1,4,7,23 July 2006
