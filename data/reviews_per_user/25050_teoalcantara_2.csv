The Monuments Men," Monumental Waste of Potential
","This had everything to be a great movie, which actually makes it an even bigger let down.First off, the movie is set in war period (the decline of Hitler's Reich), but all the characters look and act like it's Sunday in the park. There is no drama, no sense of real danger or conflict, no concerns, no mood.The scene with George Clooney and Matt Damon in the camp hospital is cringe worthy, an the two songs linked to this scene were an ordeal to endure.All the 'motivational' speeches sound corny as hell too. Not to mention all the embarrassing moments such as when George says on the radio 'all hell is breaking loose here' but nothing we see on screen support this line.The sets looked out of a theme park, sterile.And all the famous actors, although box-office baits, actually end up hurting the picture artistically. 'Look, it's John Goodman!'. 'Look, it's 'Bill Murray!'. Look it's .....(enter famous actor name here)!' and so on.The only suspenseful moment in the entire movie has to do with the eminent arrival of the Russians, but it's too brief to save this well intentioned mess.And what's with all the smoking, cigarette fixation?",5,1,2,19 May 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Thor of the Rings - Episode II: Into Darkness
","I don't know, everybody seems to like this outing, so maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for it.But from the beginning, I felt the movie was trying too hard to impress, like someone had this idea: 'Hey, Lord of the Rings is awesome, so let's put some elves and other fantasy creatures on this, and while we are at it, you know that cool sound effect of the light sabers from Star Wars? Let's add this too! After all, we have Princess Amidala in our cast! Oh, wait! I saw this movie the other day, 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' and it was f*ing a-m-a-z-i-n-g! What about having Loki resemble Khan, and we could also borrow from the title too, let's call this sequel 'Dark' something... let me see... Oh, I got it! Dark World!' I could go on and cite moments that reminded me of John Carter, King Kong, X-Men and so forth...Don't get me wrong, the movie is not bad, but at least to me, it felt too much like a 'montage' from other movies.I liked the first one very much, so maybe my expectations were too high. I'd still recommend it though.",5,1,3,4 November 2013
