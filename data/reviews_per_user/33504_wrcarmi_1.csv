It," One of the best!
","We all know Hollywood's obsession with remaking old films for a current audience. While some have proved themselves worthy of standing with the original like The Thing, Dawn of the Dead, and The Ring; most have proved to be pieces of total garbage like A Nightmare On Elm Street,Halloween 2, Black Christmas, When a Stranger Calls, The Hitcher, and so on. However, when they announced the remake of IT, I wasn't sure what to expect. The film has gone through a type of development hell to the point that they changed directors and crew. Normally, both being a remake and being stuck in development hell is a bad sign for a film. So it failed and went to bargain bin, right? Wrong! IT 2017 is quite simply one of the best movies I have seen this year and a prime example on how to do both a remake and an adaptation correctly. For starters, every actor gives it their A-game in this movie. Very few times can you ever see so many good child actors in a film. In the original mini-series, the acting could be seen as a bit off. Here? Every character had a sense of realism that I could get behind. This movie also had one of those moments were I really wanted to cheer the cast on. Very few movies have gotten me to do that and this movie did it masterfully. Bill Skarsgard impressed me as Pennywise. While he isn't in the film too much, it is a role that I enjoyed.The cinematography itself is beautiful. This movie had so many shots that I just stare on in awe at it in enjoyment. IT 2017 is simply one of the better remakes and modern horror movies that I have seen lately, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good film.",10,2,3,13 November 2017
