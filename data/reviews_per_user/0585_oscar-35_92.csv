While the filmmakers had no obligation to change his character's name (to Peter Brand), they did so willingly. The Oakland A's set the new American League record for consecutive wins, with 20. The all-time Major League record is 26, set by the New York Giants in 1916, including one tie. Without ties, the record belongs to the 1935 Chicago Cubs (21 straight wins). First baseball movie to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award (Oscar) since Field of Dreams (1989) twenty-two years earlier. *Emotion- An interesting and well acted film for those people now really into professional sports or baseball.

The zip line escape system shown at the Apollo launch pad really did exist. It was installed for the Apollo program and enhanced for the Space Shuttle program. In some pre-launch emergency scenarios, the crew would have ridden steel cages down the zip lines to explosion-proof bunkers. Astronauts practiced using the system as part of their training, but it was never used in an actual emergency. The woman who lives in K's apartment in an alternate time line, is the same woman in Men in Black II (2002), a waitress, whom Patrick Warburton's character is told to marry and have a bunch of kids. Will Smith reportedly had creative differences with director Barry Sonnenfeld over who would play the Colonel's son. Will suggested that his son Jaden Smith should play the role, but Barry disagreed, giving the role to Cayen Martin instead.*Emotion- A fun clever comedy sequel to the previous heroic films. This film makes a more satisfying look into the unique main characters persona's by learning their history that shaped their personalities from previous films. As such this film is a bit of a 'prequel' of the other films. Most of the characters and their acting are top notch and welcome.*Based On- Men In Black film franchise of previous feature films.",Null,0,0,18 August 2014
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Glaringly unbelievable to watch.

The prop anachronisms of this film are legion and make this film glaringly unbelievable to watch. *Emotion- A rather crazy action film that makes Holmes and Watson almost cartoon superheros and thus drastically changing the charm and whit of the original characters that millions of readers enjoyed.

The Monuments Men," enlightening story.
","*Spoiler/plot- The Monument Men, 2014. I group of college professors, art historians, and older men get drafted into a special group to find and return art of all media looted by the Nazis.*Special Stars- George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville, Bob Balaban, Dimitri Leonidas, Justus von Dohnanyi.*Theme- Art is a world treasure.*Trivia/location/goofs- Made in eastern Europe. The 'Monuments Men,' were a group of approximately 345 men and women from thirteen nations, most of whom volunteered for service in the newly created MFAA section during World War II. Many had expertise as museum directors, curators, art historians, artists, architects, and educators. Their job description was simple: to protect cultural treasures so far as war allowed. The character of Claire Simone, played by Cate Blanchett appears to have been based on Rose Valland, a Parisian museum curator who was drafted by the Nazis during the occupation of Paris to assist with art acquisitions. As depicted in this film and in the documentary The Rape of Europa (2006), Valland secretly kept a detailed ledger of all works that passed through Nazi hands, the original (often Jewish) owner of each work, and the location in Germany where each item was eventually transported. GOOFS- When US Army Lieutenant James Granger visits the apartment of Claire Simon, he is not wearing his uniform but is wearing a casual, short-sleeve shirt instead. During World War II, it was a strict rule that members of the military had to wear their uniforms at all times, on and off base, even while home on leave. Liberated Paris in 1944 was still considered a war zone, making his disregard for uniform especially egregious.*Emotion- It is an extremely satisfying plot and enlightening story. Only in a few times does Mr. Clooney (DIR) fail in making the actions become also most melodramatic and pedestrian.*Based On- Based on a true story.",Null,0,0,27 October 2014
Skyfall," It's great spy cinema !
","*Spoiler/plot- Skyfall, 2012. An ultra-sensitive computer hard-drive containing the names and places of every deep cover 'mole' of NATO embedded in many major terrorist groups is stolen. The hard-drive is in the hands of a X-MI6 British bureau chief that has gone crazy with having revenge against MI6 and it's operatives. X-MI6 British bureau chief attacks MI6 and it's leader, 'M' and James Bond. Mr Bond is sent in to illuminate the threat and secure the safety of the undercover operative's list. *Special Stars- Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Berenice Marlohe, Albert Finney, Ben Whishaw.*Theme- The next international terrorism is cyber-terrorism, beware and prepare. *Trivia/location/goofs- This film is very special with it's celebrating the 50th anniversary of the James Bond franchise. So there are many landmark elements of this film even when compared with past Bond films. In this film we learn about the Bond family origins; Clan of Bond names created by the production for the plaques and headstones at the chapel and graveyard include James parents; Andrew Bond and Monique Delacroix Bond. Filming primarily taking place in England. Additional location shooting was set in Scotland, Turkey and China. Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands replaced Duntrune Castle in Argyll, Scotland as the location for the film's climatic action scenes though some of that was actually filmed at Surrey's Hankley Common in England. In the end, the picture was filmed in five countries: England, Scotland, China, Turkey and Japan. In Japan, just a small amount of filming was done on Hashima Island. Sixth appearance in the official James Bond series of the classic silver-birch the Aston Martin DB5 car. First James Bond film to feature MGM's new 2012 logo. The Bond iconic gun-barrel sequence was re-shot specially for this movie. With this third Daniel Craig Bond movie, Craig has still never appeared in a traditional series gun-barrel sequence shown at the start of the film. However, it was shown after the end credits conclusion. The loudest movie scenes was the London underground tube train crash that occurs when James Bond chases Raoul Silva. Several different locations in the city of London were used as interiors and exteriors for the film, some of which would not normally be accessible for filming. London locations: included Vauxhall Bridge; Millbank; The Old Vic Tunnels; an underground car park on Great Suffolk Street; Trinity Square; the entrance to Broadgate Tower; The Virgin Active Pool in Canary Wharf; Cadogan Square, The National Portrait Gallery; Parliament Square; Tower Hill; the building roof of the Department for Energy & Climate Change (DECC); the Smithfield Meat Market; St Bartholomew's Hospital; Charing Cross Underground Station; Greenwich's Old Royal Naval College; Southwark; Whitehall; and London's landmark Trafalgar Square. *Emotion- This is a spectacularly beautiful and exciting film. The night establishing shots are breath-taking. This film clearly lives-up to and surpasses the high mark that previous Bond films established for decades. This film is a MUST SEE in a theater to get full effect, not just on a small TV monitor. You will lose some of the uniqueness on the small screen. To put the theme of this film's plot in one concise phrase, 'passing the torch- from the classic to the new'. In this film you see the 'old guard' actors playing their Bondian characters that they have for many films and this new 50th anniversary film plot establishes new actors to be in those iconic Bondian roles. There is a new Moneypenny, head of 'Q' branch and a new MI6 leader 'M'. The film's villain is truly despicable and creepy, and well acted. Also we see homages to the classic Bond films cleverly embedded in this film and referred to in dialog or visually on screen during scenes, so watch for those. The Bond film franchise is re-charged and ready for 50 more years of excitement and success. God see this film even if you're not a Bond Fan, it's great cinema!",Null,1,4,21 December 2012

This was a Hollywood big-budget show that was a runaway feature film that shot in North Carolia due to special tax breaks for productions companies. California and it's studios & crews cannot compete. A real shame.*Emotion- A typical summer 'popcorn' action movie with a lot of special digital GFX and short of plot or character.

A rich film production of Eton Johns life from his young days through his musical tutoring days and his commercial music life till his happiness in today's music scene today.*Special Stars- Taron Egerton, Jamie Bell, Richard Madden, Bryce Dallas Howard, Gemma Jones, Matther Illesley, Kit Connor, and more.*Theme- Seeking approval and love from others your whole life can take you on an unexpected adventure of 'ups and downs'.*Trivia/location/goofs- This is an all UK film show, Cast & crew. It was produced by Eton John, himself. Bryce Dallas Howard who plays 'Sheila', Eton's mum is DIR- Ron Howard's daughter.
*Emotion- it's a musical about Eton John's life. Very interesting production with full on singing and dance routines mixed in during the plot. Kidda depressing in his young beginning years and in his successful'excess years'. The lead actor, 'Karon' (who played grown up 'Eton') is a relatively newcomer in films. He played the lead English training spy in the British spy parody, 'The Kingsmen' franchise. He does an amazing performance in this film with total emotional depth. I wouldn't be surprised he gets an award nomination for his work in this film. If you like or know Eton John's songs, they take on a whole new meaning in their use to illustrate his life and moods in this film of his growth into adulthood and successes. I know a couple of his songs have been influential on me through my life. It also features heavily, his life long song lyric writer & friend, Bernie Tauppin in this film.

The team is discovered and almost gets wiped-out until new villagers assist and fight off the terrorists hord.*Special Stars- Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsh, Ben Foster, Eric Bana, Alexander Ludwig.*Theme- Freedom is everyone's business.*Trivia/location/goofs- Made in eastern Europe. In real life the fire fight Marcus Luttrell and company engaged in with the Taliban last far longer than in the film and the whole ordeal was five days compared to the three depicted in the film. Was made relatively cheaply by writer/director Peter Berg who labored to make it happen over five years. Involved only a 42-day shoot and $40 million budget. Stars Taylor Kitsch and Mark Wahlberg worked at a discount, as did Berg, for the mandatory Directors Guild minimum salary of $17,000 a week. The tumbling and falling scenes were filmed on location without CGI enhancement, and necessitated that the stunt performers subject themselves to genuinely hard falls. After one such stunt, Mark Wahlberg's stunt double had to be hospitalized. Marcus Luttrell: At about the 12:30 mark of the movie he's the SEAL 'Frank' or 'Frankie' that spills the coffee and tells the rookie to clean it up. He appears again on the rescue helicopter. Though it is not mentioned in the movie, Marcus Luttrell was personally awarded the Navy Cross by then-President George W. Bush. Lieutenant Michael Murphy would be awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously. Axelson and Dietz were also awarded the Navy Cross posthumously. GOOFS- In one scene a common New Mexico diamondback rattlesnake slithers across the ground. Diamondbacks are not native to Afghanistan. In numerous shots of the SEALs falling down the mountains the faces of the replacement stunt performers are visible.*Emotion-A harsh story to watch due to it's true plot and vicious SEAL warfare action against Taliban terrorists.

Star Trek," Enjoyable
","I saw and enjoyed Star Trek XI, in IMAX. It was well worth the couple of extra dollars. The film should be well received as shown in regular theaters. The IMAX screen is huge and the sound system is monstrous, both enjoyable with this film.1. The opening scenes are grabbers and explain Kirk's family background in a exciting starship battle.2. The new young cast has been very impressive to see how they brought the exact TOS roles to this film's new time frame.3. CGI was NOT a scenes stealer or overused.4. For myself, I was glad to see that many filming locations were in the SoCal area so filming helped the local sagging movie economy. Some of those spots were CSUN, Kernville, Tustin, Van Nuys and more.5. You don't have to me a hardcore fan to enjoy this film. Hardcore fans might have a problem with some of the plot explanations of long misunderstood Trek 'canon' assumptions the fans have developed for themselves. But those explanations are plausible and fit the plot story line nicely.6. The film was dedicated to Majel and Gene Roddenberry.",Null,1,12,15 June 2009

The Sherman tank crew has been together since North Africa, but has recently lost a crew mate. They receive a untrained reluctant replacement soldier who causes problems for the tank crew and needs to adapt to his new job as assistant driver. Drama ensues.*Special Stars- Brad Pitt, Shia LeBoeuf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal, Scott Eastwood.*Theme- War is serious and important work.*Trivia/location/goofs- Filmed in England. Fury marks the first time a genuine Tiger I tank has been used in the production of a WWII film. Fury features 'Tiger 131' from the UK's Bovington Tank Museum, the only fully functioning Tiger tank in the world. Shia Lebeouf reportedly pulled out his own tooth and did not shower during filming. Fury is about the U.S. 2nd Armored division. The 2nd Armored is also known as 'Hell on Wheels'. The Assault Rifle carried by Brad Pitt is a German made StG 44 also known as a Sturmgewehr 44. A gun personally approved by Adolf Hitler for his SS troops. The fight with the Tiger tank clearly shows rounds from the Sherman tank guns bouncing off the Tiger's frontal armor. The L40 76mm M1A2 gun mounted on Fury was easily capable of penetrating the front armor of a Tiger tank at ranges of 400 to 700 meters. The fight was clearly under 200 meters, at which range the rounds from the 2 76mm armed Sherman tanks would have penetrated the Tiger's frontal armor. An experienced tank commander would attack the Tiger from the side, where the armor was only 60mm thick, rather than from the rear, where it was 80mm.e GOOFS: The mouths of the Waffen SS troops are not singing during that road marching scene to the crossroads were 'Fury' was stopped by an German anti-tank mine.*Emotion- An extremely well produced and acted story about how tank crews bonded, died, and fought in Europe. Good demonstration of era tank tactics and daily life.*Based On- Loosesly based on many Allied tank commander's experiences in WW2.",Null,3,10,27 October 2014

Their weekly session concept catches on with underground male 'fight clubs' forming in every town, until an another sick eccentric woman gets in the way and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion for the males.*Special Stars- Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helen Bonham Cater.*Theme- Mental illness should not be taken lightly. Get professional help at all times. *Trivia/location/goofs- Color. Helena Bonham Carter wore platform shoes to help close up the disparity in height between her and Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. When the 'Narrator' hits Tyler Durden in the ear, Edward Norton actually did hit Brad Pitt in the ear. He was originally going to fake hit him, but before the scene, David Fincher pulled Norton aside and told him to hit him in the ear. After Norton hit him in the scene, you can see him smiling and laughing while Pitt is in pain. Author Chuck Palahniuk first came up with the idea for the novel after being beaten up on a camping trip when he complained to some nearby campers about the noise of their radio. When he returned to work, he was fascinated to find that nobody would mention or acknowledge his injuries, instead saying such commonplace things as 'How was your weekend?' Palahniuk concluded that the reason people reacted this way was because if they asked him what had happened, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary, and his workmates simply didn't care enough to connect with him on a personal level. It was his fascination with this societal 'blocking' which became the foundation for the novel. *Emotion- This film has a deceivingly simple plot in the very beginning, but de-evolves into a psychological thriller of inner depth as it progresses. Well worth seeing for it's intricacies. This film was marketed wrongly as a one dimensional guy film of fist, yelling, and toilet humor.*Based on- popular novel.",Null,0,1,17 June 2014

CGI cameos- Peter Cushing, Carrie Fisher.*Theme- Rebellions are built on hope and audacity.*Trivia/location/goofs- Disney produced. The film only starts with traditional text, 'A long time ago in a galaxy far away'. No explanatory screen craw at the film's beginning. Locations: Iceland, Jorden, and Pacific islands. Film shows the plot just before the original Star Wars film with Luke meeting Leia.*Emotion-I was purposely very slow to see and review this film. Primarily because of my disappointment with the last Star Wars film with 'Daisy' as her slick manufactured female role model star for little girls. This film was a complete opposite in it's emotional connection to the audience. It has all the heroic spirit of the first SW films. The acting, plot, themes and film pacing was perfect. The CGI was a subtle tool used to advance the plot when needed, and not another director's toy. The Death Star matters in their destructive scope were excellent. And the space battle scenes were exhilarating and exciting. Let's keep this up for the next SW shows, OK ? *Based On- A screenplay and the Star Wars universe. in the Star Wars universe.",Null,3,5,25 May 2017

At the end is a memorial card thanking Stan Lee. This was done due to Mr. Lee's sad death during the film's production. Also keep an eye out for Stan Lee's cameo as an old man
reading dialog from a film script in a subway car.
*Emotion- I love adventure and heroic films. I really wanted to like this film, but found it extremely confused to try to follow the plot and character line the way this film was edited together. Endless 'flash backs' and 'dream sequences' and new planetary jumps jumble the plot. I thought it had a weak and terrible first act with not enough 'exposition' to get the audience into the story. So keep this in mind: this is essentially a superhero 'SPY' film. So there is
intrigue and sub-plots with deceptions and faux 'good guys' and 'bad' guys and many twists & changes. IMVHO-A similar galactic corps super hero film, 'Green Lantern' is easier to follow. As a film audience member that also worked in 'Da Biz' since 1986, I was not happy how the film plot's USAF fighter pilot main character was on screen. She seemed to be a 'over-produced by
endless audience market research screenings', very artificial & dated studio's idea of a fighter jock with long blond hair. Kidda cartoonish, overdone, and unbelievable. Her screen character made me especially enjoy when 'Fury' Jackson and 'Colson' Gregg arrived in the film's plot due to their huge believability and established spy characters. But that took m out of my enjoyment of this film that I wanted and expected.*Based On- On the Marvel comics super hero that they won from their legal court battle copyright law from 'Wiz' comics ( was D.C.) from 1940's.",Null,8,12,14 April 2019

Mr Lee shows up as a Larry King knockoff. Nick fury of SHIELD is introduced in this film with some suggestions to the next Marvel comic film, 'Thor'. The end credits has a 'stinger' scene at the film's very end for 'Thor'.*Emotion- An enjoyable popcorn and comic book action film, little more.

In real life, makeup artist John Chambers (played by John Goodman) came up with the title 'Argo' because he loved knock-knock jokes. In the film, the title becomes an off-color joke. In the movie, it was stated that both the British and New Zealand embassies in Tehran turned away the six American diplomats, leaving the Canadians as their only refuge. In fact the British embassy did shelter the six for a few days but it was agreed by everyone that the Canadian embassy would be more secure and suitable, so they moved. A New Zealand official transported them and the British also helped other Americans trapped in the country at the time. The director Ben Affleck acknowledged that he intentionally deviated from the real events in order to quicken the pace and build up the tension. With John Goodman's performance as John Chambers, this is the only time that a real-life Oscar winner is portrayed in a film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Ben Affleck was criticized by some viewers for casting himself (a European-American) as Tony Mendez and not a Latino/Hispanic actor. Mendez (who is half-Mexican, half-European) however said he had 'no problem' with being portrayed by Affleck, and approved of his performance.*Emotion- A well acted, produced and good paced suspense film with many twists and turns. Good tension by the viewer. The fact that this plot was loosely a true story only helps it's credibility and enjoyment. The end of the film is somewhat spoiled by the narration of X-president Jimmy Carter trying to positively cash-in on the international incident and the possible deaths of the 6 hostages. That's a shameful action from a America's shameful president of his era.*Based on- The Iranian American embassy take over and hostage crisis.",Null,0,1,6 July 2014

Christopher Doohan, son of Star Trek:TOS chief engineer has a background performer role at the transporter console next to Mr. Pegg. Locations: StarFleet Headquarters is Getty Art Museum-entrance foyer, back water feature patio, and front steps. USS Enterprise engine & warp core room is The Vany Nuys Budweiser beer brewing tank room. Special Effects scenes shot in Iceland. GOOFS- *Major confusing plot hole: The older Spock calling in at the right moment to the USS enterprise on main viewer and talking to his younger self, Quinto Spock 'Prime'. (Prime Directive violation?). Casting goof- Kahn is supposedly from the Indian Sub-continent and Benicio Del Torro was being considered but contracts got stalled on pay. Mr. Cumberbatch as a last choice for the role and doesn't fit the Star Trek Canon. IN the London shots, the British Union Jack is flying wrong-side up. *Emotion- On whole this film has good action and writing to follow it's previous reboot of Star Trek. Fans that know the S.T. Canon will have problems with the extremely bad casting choice of Mr. Cumberbatch to play the villain from the subcontinent of India, Khan. There was several dizzying scenes with too much camera movement, instead of distracting lens flare. All of Kirk's crew received good meaty supporting scenes and they were heroic in them. There seemed to be too much running around in many scenes. Several scenes and their blocking were exactly like and looked like scenes from other iconic films. The opening scene was like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark, others stole from 'The Godfther' and so on. That was not helpful and sunk any much needed 'suspension of belief' the sci-fi audience needed to enjoy this film to the fullest. Also, there seemed an inordinate need and amount of Star Trek 'homages' to previously know or seen plot points. That also hindered viewers 'suspension of belief'.*Based On- Gene Roddenberry's original TV series, Star Trek.",Null,0,0,26 August 2013

This director's re-cut and re-release is confirmation that his film was too long and had an unrecognizable plot.*Emotion- This film is too long and now has even more family angst added to this new version. What is also jarring is the fact that the lead Greek heroes have hard Irish accents, especially from Colin Ferrell who plays Alexander the Macedonia from upper Greece. Even Angeline Jolie makes terrible mistakes in her shifting Russian accent from her character throughout the film.*Based on- Herodotus and Ptolemy written accounts of Alexander's life from 100 years later.",Null,1,1,18 October 2016

Film is dedicated to Stan Winson the iconic make-up artist of this film. It was his last. Budget of film was $200 million. Mr. Swartzenegger was approached to cameo in this film, but he turned the job down. He appears in a CGI version.*Emotion- An over complicated sequel with huge plot holes to the Terminator saga. A lot of mindless action with a razor thin plot. The only interesting dramatic plot twist comes at the final scenes where John Connor's life is saved by transplanting the human heart of a death penalty prisoner cyborg created to destroy The Resistance by Skynet. Sky net's creation becomes it's instrument of it's own destruction. Clever but does little to make this film memorable.

Aquaman," Full of obvious audience viewing 'shiny objects' plot devices, YUK !
","Aquaman review matters- I wanted to like and enjoy this film. BUT, I agree with others here saying the plot was an overall mess of changing characterization fiascos and cliches', but feel they set 'the bar' too high. Those people are discussing films as if they are 'art' and not 'product'. That discussion has gone on for years with career professional, critics, audience and fans. It will never end. Because every opinion is backed by their own point of view and that will not be compromised. BUT, I agree that 'Aquaman' had a interesting, fun and very strong first act. That was a pleasure to see in any superhero films. It is a prerequisite for good film making. But then the rest of the film was disappointment. It became a 'Thor VS Loki' in underwater kingdom rip off. And the extraneous & obvious audience viewing 'shiny objects' plot devices thrown in with red haired (forgettable) underwater princess, dinosaurs, trident seeking, sea monsters, and confusing multi sea kingdoms politics junk pile rehash ruined this film. Disney, Spielberg, Pirates of Caribbean, LOTR, & Game of Thrones should sue.

A new super villain is introduced and has to fight 'Spidey'.*Special Stars- Tom Holland, Michael Keaton*Theme- You can always trust your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.*Trivia/location/goofs- In an interview from 2013, while promoting his upcoming film, How I Live Now (2013), Tom Holland was asked by a reporter what kind of role he might want to try next. When Holland replied, saying a project with action and humor would be of interest to him, the reporter asked if he would ever like to play a superhero. 'Maybe Spider-Man, in ten years time,' answered Holland. 'The reboot of the reboot, if they do that.' Spider-Man never punches any of the villains he fights. He uses his webs, he counters his enemies punches which causes them to punch each other, he even kicks them, but he never punches them. Nineteen-year-old Tom Holland was the youngest actor to be cast as Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire was cast at 25, and Andrew Garfield was 26.
*Emotion- A very fun and enjoyable film. Tom Holland does the best presentation of this gymnastic teenage super hero than any actor before him. He has extensive gymnastic and dance training for the physical work and he has just the right juvenile tone to his character when needed in those school, family, and neighborhood scenes.

Drama ensues when SHIELD becomes under the World Government's control.*Special Stars- Chris Evans, Sebastian Stan, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Reford *Theme- Friendship lasts forever.*Trivia/location/goofs- Sequel. 3-D in some theaters. The second of the Captain American films. MMA cage fighter Georges St-Pierre plays 'Batroc the Leaper'. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) relates a story of his grandfather being an elevator operator. In real life, Samuel L. Jackson's father was an elevator operator. Unlike the other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, 'The Winter Soldier' minimizes the use of visual effects as much as possible. Anthony Mackie, elaborated: 'The Russos, what they did that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form...If they could build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great.' Robert Redford wanted to do the film because his grandchildren are fans of Marvel films and he wanted them to see him in one. In an attempt to prevent spoilers and keep secrecy, the working title of the project while filming was 'Freezer Burn.' Locations: Washington D.C. The mall/shopping center in which Black Widow and Captain America visit in order to find the origin of the encrypted USB stick is called the Tower City Center in Cleveland, OH. The front of the building and its concourse were used in The Avengers as the opera hall in which Loki confronts German opera patrons. TWO 'stinger; post ending credits scenes are at the end of this film. Be sure to stay and not miss them.*Emotion- I was disappointed with the plot of this film. It was essentially done in the Marvel Comic TV show, 'Agents of SHIELD'. The film was artistically done and well acted. But the plot devices were boring and were seen coming along a mile away. Too overused. Robert Redfort looked 'older than dirt' and should stay off the movie screen at his advanced age. He was boring and predictable in his performances. I'm glad the directors made a conscience effort to stay away from CGI effects and used practical special effects instead.

Even if it includes hiring some assistance from one of their own old opponents in Vegas, Terry Benedict.*Special Stars- Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Al Pacino, Elliot GOuld, Ellen Barkin.*Theme- Friendship is thicker than money.*Trivia/location/goofs- Color. Las Vegas, NV. The line 'You shook Sinatra's hand' mentioned several times in the movie is a reference to Frank Sinatra who played the first role as 'Danny Ocean' in the original Ocean's Eleven (1960). Matt Damon's (Linus) fake nose disguise ploy is called 'The Brody'. It's a reference to the french actor Adrien Brody. The dialog phrase 'Billy Martin' that Danny calls for to Willie during the Reuben's hospitalization is a gambling slang for second chance. The phrase refers to famed Major League Baseball New York Yankee's manager, Billy Martin. Despite his talents as a manager (he led the New York Yankees to two World Series titles); Martin's fiery temper, fueled by his alcoholism, often got him into trouble and as a result, he was fired multiple times by owner George Steinbrunner. Despite his character flaws and drinking, Billy Martin was always being given a 'second chance'. Also, the character's dialog make several references to a 'Susan B. Anthony' deal in their heist. This is a reference to the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin manufactured by the US mint in 1979. It was so similar in appearance and size to a regular quarter and many people dropped it into a slot machine without realizing what it was worth. This 'con' method was used twice in the film, though the people are using an ordinary coin they don't realize that it will be worth millions in the slot: first by the woman in 'The Bank' casino who wins the million dollar jackpot and later by the tormented hotel reviewer at the Vegas airport slot machine.*Emotion- The fun and rich romp for the viewer. Not only well acted, casted, and written, but hugely entertaining because the film-watcher can fantasize and become involved in the 'caper' as well.*Based on- 60's Rat Pack and Frank Sinatra Vegas initial 'caper' film.",Null,0,0,17 June 2014

According to Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity, it would take an infinite amount of time to cross the threshold of a black hole's event horizon, as seen by a distant observer. The person crossing the threshold, however, would notice no change in the flow of time. The majority of shots of the robot TARS were not computer generated. Rather, TARS was a practical puppet controlled and voiced on-set by Bill Irwin, who was then digitally erased from the movie. Irwin also puppeteered the robot CASE, but in that instance, had his voice dubbed over by Josh Stewart.
*Emotion- I had a hard time with this film's story. The other OVER theoretical plot of 'black holes' and space travel through them took me out of the film's believability and enjoyment.

He only knows that Earth is completely depleted after sixty years of nuclear war against the alien invaders, Scavengers 'Scavs'. The aliens have destroyed the moon and were defeated by nuclear weapons but the earthlings have moved to Jupiter's moon, Titan since the planet was completely destroyed by warfare. Now Jack has to protect the power stations that use the ocean to supply energy to Titan by fixing the drones patrolling the wastes. He also has memories of a mysterious woman at the Empire State Building when Earth was habitable.

DIR- Zack Snyder.*Theme- Hero's that unite against horrific evil will always win.*Trivia/location/goofs- Henry Cavill worked on the reshoots and Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018) at the same time. He had to sport a mustache for his role in the latter project, however Paramount refused to let the actor shave it off for the time he played Superman again. This meant that Cavill's facial hair had to be digitally removed in post-production. Extensive reshoots in London and Los Angeles in mid-2017 added a cost of approximately $25 million to the film's budget. Gal Gadot's work on 'Justice League' began the day after she wrapped production on 'Wonder Woman.' The line-up in this film is based on the founding members from the New 52 origin story (with the exception of Green Lantern). During the Silver Age origin story, Martian Manhunter was one of the founding members. He was replaced with Cyborg (who was previously known as a founding member of the New Teen Titans) in the New 52 version.
*Emotion- A fun and adventurous film. The villain part of this plot and his task to conquer Earth was very disappointing. The super villain, 'Steppenwolf' was terrible and unbelievable.

The Paris train station police inspector wounded WW1 veteran with a steel leg brace heavy Cockney English accent working selected by the actor Sacha 'Borat' Cohen was a questionable choice and why not a French accent. The portable film screen used to show Mrs. Milies her husband's film remaining film by the museum professor was not available during the time period of this film, an anachronism.*Emotion- An enjoyable but rather preachy film on the origins and scarcity of early 'Flickers' one reel films from the 1890's by George Milies encased in a family drama. While the narrative plot of this film is thin but charming, the rest of the film is a bio-pic of George Milies and tediously showcased his life and his works. The acting in this film was pedestrian but the biographic matter was of some note to hardcore film students and historians. Mainstream audience will find this film slow and boring with little human pathos. There were too many boring digital dolly tracking shots, disgusting digital 'dust in the air' shots and infinity digital sets shots that detracted greatly from the enjoyment of the dramatic scenes.

Portions of the film were shot at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the massive external tanks for the space shuttle program were constructed. The alien 'Formics' have the features and behaviors of ants. Also relatedly, the compound Formic Acid is found in the venom of ants. The facial markings on the Queen at the film end when she shows Ender the egg cocoon are very similar to the traditional facial tattoos of the New Zealand Maori warrior/instructor Colenel Mazer Rackham.*Emotion- THis is a visually rich film with expensive production values on the screen. But, unfortunately the politically progressive theme gets in the way of the 'suspending of belief' to enjoy this story.

One psychic soldier, Lynn Cassady that has huge powers leads the reporter around the Middle East to see the New Earth Army in it's covert warfare and tells him of the armies history.*Special Stars- George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey, Ewan McGregor.*Theme- US Defense Department money is often used for off beat counter measures to enemy attacks on the nation.*Based on- Non-fictional book about The New Earth Army Robert Patrick's book of the same film name.*Trivia/location/goofs- Ewan McGregor played the Jedi master in the Star Wars prequels and his role talks about Jedi soldiers of The New Earth Army, ironic as bit. The Fort Bragg scenes were shot at New Mexico Military Institute, Roswell NM.*Emotion- A rather mad 'new age' scientist/soldier movie with a comedic look at real life events that are almost too bizarre to believe when the US government attempts to harness soldiers with paranormal abilities to combat the nation's enemies is a less violent way. Supposedly a true story about soldiers using their advanced combat techniques and their using 'Remote Viewing' to see places and people the army wishes to know more about.",Null,0,2,24 October 2011
Dunkirk," A well thought out and produced film
","*Spoiler/plot- Dunkirk, 2017. British Expeditionary forces, French, and other allied armies become encircled and cutoff from supplies and support. A major evacuation effort is mounted by the British Navy and civilian boat owners to land in the shallow beaches to get survivors out to fight another day.*Special Stars- Fionne Whitehead, Barry Keoghan. DIR: Christopher Nolan*Theme- You sometimes have to re-group and attack a problem another day.*Trivia/location/goofs- According to Sir Kenneth Branagh, roughly thirty Dunkirk survivors, who were in their mid nineties, attended the premiere in London, England. When asked about the movie, they felt that it accurately captured the event, but that the soundtrack was louder than the actual bombardment, a comment that greatly amused Writer, Producer, and Director Christopher Nolan. The end credits state that twelve of the original little ships that participated in the Dunkirk evacuation appeared in the movie, re-enacting their presence in 1940. When Farrier (Tom Hardy) lands his Spitfire on the Dunkirk shore, the plane is actually being piloted by American billionaire Dan Friedkin, who loaned planes from his personal collection to this movie. Near the end of the movie, a Spitfire without fuel is seen shooting down a Stuka dive-bomber. This is historically correct.. The Stukas were notoriously easy targets for fighter planes (especially when preparing to dive) and, in the following Battle of Britain, a significant number were shot down.
*Emotion- A well thought out and produced film to demonstrate the many darkest matters of this mass evacuation under the German guns. Many details of the on camera scenes were meticulously researched and portrayed. The audience gets treated to some real emotion on how the event was played out during those dark days.*Based On- An historical WW2 event.",Null,1,3,17 April 2019

Supposedly the second most expensive film (over 200 million) 20th Century Fox film has ever produced. Goofs: In the comics, Mystique cannot replicate powers; only appearance. Using her DNA should only allow future sentinels the ability to shape-change. The limitations of Mystique's powers in the movie universe are confirmed in the first movie, when she fought Wolverine as him, he was able to cut off her claws, as she could not replicate the adimantium coating his bones and claws. When Magneto levitates RFK Stadium, it seen with a baseball diamond and configuration. In 1973 RFK Stadium was not being used as a baseball venue as the Washington Senators had moved to Texas following the 1971 season. As the cassette player/headphones system was known in 1973, the one (worn and played by Quicksilver) would not be introduced to the United States market until 1979. A 747-400 jetliner can be seen in a 1973 scene. This variant of the 747 did not fly until 1988.*Emotion- A well written film with all the most exciting elements possible for sci-fi fans. Time Travel, mutants, robots, and action & intrigue in three historical time periods. The star cast was enormous. With the addition of 3-D into the mix of viewing this film, the film gets top marks all around.*Based On- Marvel X-men comic books characters and franchise.",Null,0,1,18 August 2014

They were displaced 60 years before by the hated fire-breathing dragon that rules in Middle Earth.*Special Stars- Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blacnhett, Andy Serkis, Sylvester McCoy, Christopher Lee. *Theme- Adventures are ways to learn about life and find new friends, be open to it.*Trivia/location/goofs- First part of a two part film. Exteriors filmed in the director's home country of New Zealand. Look for many crossover characters and plot connections to the Lord of the Ring trilogy saga (that takes place in a time-line after this Bilbo adventure).*Emotion- An optically stunning film full of new characters, places, and plot twists. Slighty slow in starting to set the premise of the new Middle Earth to viewers, but then the journey is full of drama, pathos and action. This film has more scary scenes and has some very graphically hand-to-hand battle violence. It is more violent than the previous LOTR trilogy. (Parents of young children should take note. This is not a Disney kiddie film.) My favorite scene that was particularly well done in this film was when the Eagles rescue the entire group from a pack of wolf riding attacking trolls on a high mountain cliff. I found this film to be not as watchable as the LOTR trilogy, but worth your time especially if you read the book. Good literature put on film.",Null,1,3,28 February 2013
Zulu," One of the last great 60's 'Sagas'
","*Spoiler/plot- ZULU, 1964, A small British unit is trapped in a small farmhouse when war breaks out between the Zulu nation and the British forces in Southeastern Africa. The Zulu army is sent to wipe out the unit, but British courage, training and leadership saves it from another Zulu massacre/victory.*Special Stars- Michael Caine, Stanley Baker, Jack Hawkins, James Booth *Theme- Military unit teamwork and training will defeat overwhelming odds.*Trivia/location/goofs- Several obvious camera shadows, microphone boom in frame, and continuity errors in the action and battle sequences. Historical errors dealing with the farm house British unit and the real lives of the Victorian Cross (gallant valor) winners are differing from what was presented, but those matters are trivial to the screen action and dramatic story. Richard Burton (Welshman) was the narrator in this film about a Welsh regiment. This was Michael Caine's first film appearance. Micheal Caine wanted to play the Cockney character, 'Private Hook' in this film but an actor Cockney friend, James Booth, got the role. Stanley Baker saw that Mr. Caine's casting was more upper-class, so Mr.Baker(producer/star) and Cyd Enfield had Mr. Caine change his dialect and play the 'Bromhead' officer role. Jack Hawkins was fighting off oncoming throat cancer (from cigarette smoking) and so his dialog were later re dubbed. Real present day Zulus were used in this film and were paid with wristwatches for their work. Some wristwatches are seen on camera in battle and dance scenes. A film sequel(Zulu Dawn) was made many years later, while more historically accurate starring Burt Lancaster; it flopped.*Emotion- One of the last great 60's 'Sagas' on film. This film's iconic scenes and action have never been duplicated successfully and with such heroic fervor. This story was magnificently shown on film and this film has become a 'place-holder' in the minds of it's viewers. Other Victorian British army subject matter films like Four Feathers, Khartoum, and 55 Days in Peking are good but only shadowy knock-offs of the iconic work in the original, ZULU.",Null,2,4,30 October 2012

Big budget film from the same Hollywood studio that almost was bankrupted by their other film being made, 'Cleopatra'. This film made 20th Century Fox Studios a profit and it's independent producer, Darryl Zanuck head of that studio. One of the biggest cast of international film star's ever seen in cinema.

General Patton had a uncharacteristically high pitched scratchy voice. Not as the film portrayed. Filmed in Spain with Spanish army subing for German WW2 army. The same production team did another good military bio-pic about Douglas MacArthur starring Greg Peck.*Emotion- A wonderful and factual 'bio'pic based on the WW2 exploits of Americas most knowledgeable and flamboyant army general.

Stallone himself was actually quite reluctant to do the film at first, as he did not want to parody Rocky (1976) and De Niro had to talk him into it. Stallone himself claimed that he had a harder than usual time training for the role since he was taking a break from action roles and had stopped working out.*Emotion- This film is a clever plot and has a 'heart'. Both leads play the full depth of emotions for their role. No doubt their film careers gave them plenty of experience. Not sure how much acting was involved here.

The Guardians of the Galaxy is primarily based on the 2008 comic team (Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket Raccoon and Groot), but features Yondu, a member of the original 1969 comic team. In Dutch, Afrikaans and Flemish 'Groot' means big. 'I am Groot' translates as 'I am big'. Howard The Duck can actually be spotted an additional time before his after-credits scene. When Quill and the rest of the team first arrive at The Collector's gallery, as The Collector turns around to face them, you can briefly see Howard sitting in his glass box in the background above and just to the right of The Collector's head. According to Vin Diesel, his performance as Groot helped him through a dark time in his life; he was dealing with the loss of his best friend and 'Fast and Furious' co-star Paul Walker: 'It was the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death, so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice.' GOOF: As Star Lord is entering the temple to steal the orb he grabs and picks up one of the rat creatures. In the close up shot that follows he uses the rat as a microphone. In the next long shot he has no rat, next close up shot the rat is back. This repeats again.*Emotion- I visually rich film with many lead and supporting characters. New alien races and planets is somewhat confusing to keep straight in your viewer's head. This film's plot has so many 'bad guys' and some real big & powerful 'bad guys'. I found that some of the anti-heros were supposed to be 'good-guys'....too confusing to understand, read, and have an opinion about. Very complex and confusing.

It looked like this film was 'cashing-in' on the recent Hollywood studio 100th anniversaries 'nostalia' news. I wanted to like this film due to enjoying and knowledgeable about the history of Hollywood, I could not. It wasn't entertaining and the box office ticket receipts agree with me worldwide.

Bobbitt contacted Sony to see if they had any available for filming. They didn't, so he eventually created six from scratch. After many rumors, Karen Gillan reprised her role as Nebula without shaving her head. Chris Pratt said that he found the workout regimen for his shirtless scene much easier than the one in the first film, because he was already in great shape going into the film.

Most of the outdoor city scenes were filmed in Saint Petersburg, Russia. This was for two reasons. First the architecture of the city has many Germanic aspects. Second, there are plenty of streets with little or no modern advertisements and other commercial aspects. Clips from this movie are used in numerous parodies that appear on YouTube in which a scene (usually the one of Adolf Hitler yelling at his subordinates) is re-subtitled to imbue it with unintended new comedic meaning and pathos. Contrary to the reaction of Constantin Films, director Oliver Hirschbiegel claims to have seen over a hundred of such parodies, and enjoyed them very much. YouTube has since stopped blocking these parodies for copyright infringement concerns.*Emotion- A strong emotional, compelling, well-acted film putting the world's most hated and outrageous Natzi WW2 leaders into their last days. You see and experience a fictional dramatic account of their movements and words among their staff and crews. I found the film too sympathetic and well mannered in making these hugely unethical leaders in charge of millions as more victims. I did not see them as such.

Prometheus," Another dark film with little new adventure rehash.
","*Spoiler/plot- Prometheus, 2012. Set in 2093 and takes place in the same universe as the Ridley Scott, 'Alien' movies. A group of explorers, including some archaeologists, are on an 'undisclosed' mission that is funded by a huge corporate entity for a trillion dollars. Then the explorers arrive at a planet millions of miles away from Earth. The team spot what they believe to be signs of an advanced civilization with a huge spacecraft. They go into the craft to investigate and find more than just signs, they find conclusive evidence with life, language, and instruments. But some of the Weyland corporate leaders on board have an ulterior motive for being there. They believe that this is where the human race actually came from. Things soon turn from excitement to survival once inside their discovery and alien spacecraft.*Special Stars- Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Charlize Theron. DIR: Ridley Scott *Theme- If We're designed by the alien 'engineers', but who designed them? *Trivia/location/goofs- Color. As mentioned in the film, the original Prometheus was a character from Greek mythology. He was a Titan (an immortal older god), who gave the gift of fire to human beings. Prometheus was punished for this by being bound to a rock in Hades (the Greek underworld), where each day an eagle, the emblem of Zeus, was sent to feed on his liver, only to have it grow back to be eaten again the next day. In some stories, Prometheus is freed at last by the hero Heracles (Hercules). Among the ancient Greeks, Prometheus was venerated as a deity. Prometheus may derive from the Greek for 'forethinker', or the Proto-Indo-European for'thief', Prometheus also tricked the gods, which is of relevance to this film. Charlize Theron found herself struggling during her action scenes due to her smoking habit, particularly the segments that required her to run through sand in boots weighing 30 pounds. The 'beginning of time' sequence that opens the film was shot in Iceland. The whole shoot took two weeks to complete. Was originally conceived as a prequel to Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), but Scott announced his decision to turn it into an original film with Noomi Rapace (who was already set to star) still in the cast as one of five main characters. Some time later it was confirmed that while the movie would take place in the same universe as Alien and greatly reference that movie, it would mostly be an original movie and not a direct prequel.*Emotion- Another dark film with little adventure or action in it. The plot has so many 'plot holes' in it due to the terrible sound levels than are inconsistent so as to leave some important plot point dialog unheard. The viewer is frustrated early in the film for the plot jumping decades to push the story along. The 2080 spacesuits in this film seems to be more fragile and dangerous for the wearers. They break easier than the old Apollo NASA suits which protected the astronauts.*Based on- Ridley Scott 'Alein' movies and their franchise.",Null,0,2,24 June 2014

She accidentally meets a human male during the WW1 conflict and wants to help humanity in their time of need. All the while keeping watch for any god-like villains that would threaten the Earth and it's inhabitants.*Special Stars- Gal Gadot, Chris Prine.*Theme- To help in making the world a better place and peaceful, people need to be active in societies' workings.*Trivia/location/goofs- Gal Gadot trained for nine months to gain seventeen pounds of pure muscle. The scenes of Themyscira were shot in Southern Italy, on the Amalfi Coast. Production designer Aline Bonetto said the location was perfect: 'Italy had beautiful weather, a beautiful blue-green sea, not too much tide, not too much wave.' In Greco-Roman mythology, the Amazons of Themyscira and the Greek hero Heracles share a rivalry, since Heracles seduced Queen Hippolyta and stole her enchanted belt. This carried over into both DC and Marvel comics. In the DC Comics, Hercules (who is the Roman version of the Greek Heracles) is a misogynistic and villainous character who was punished by the Amazons for defiling them; he later became an anti-hero who sought redemption for his actions. Some of the Amazons have flesh colored cloth over one side of their chest, almost seeming like one breast was uncovered or nonexistent (this is very apparent in the opening sequence when young Diana watches the training and Antiope walks over to talk with an Amazon so clad). This may be a reference to the fact that Amazons are often depicted in art as having one breast exposed. Ancient sources even state that Amazons cut or burned off their breast on their dominant side so that it wouldn't interfere with combat, especially with a bow. Some ancient sources suggest that this is the source of their name; 'a-mazos' in Greek means 'without breast'.

Such weapons were not readily in the US Army arsenal at that time. They weren't available to line troops until the mid '70s.*Emotion- A much anticipated 'prequel' to the X-man grand Summer blockbuster saga. This film unfortunately leaves the fans 'wanting' due to introducing too many unknown superheroes good mutants and those actors put in these 'lead' roles.

Or what's the point? Bad guys are not heroic and now the good guys? Too confusing. People need some role models and in this film, it isn't till the end to find one. Too much double dealing, traitors, complex bad and good characters, and weirdos to go around. This is a very violent film with deaths by the hundreds for little reason. The drama of that plot act has little use or impact. It's lost. A flat violent film with little watch-ability.*Based on- The Dark Knight Comics version of DC Comic Batman.",Null,0,1,12 August 2014
Iron Man," The definitive, Ironman,
","I'm usually pretty skeptical about comic book to film translations thanks to such esteemed disappointments as 'Captain America', 'Daredevil', and 'Punisher' (the early 90's version with Dolph Lundgren). But this movie, which could've been bad.....real bad, found a way to be amusing and greatly entertaining, while at the same time staying faithful to the comics original characters, story lines, and influences.Now this film's not might win film awards and isn't going to turn non-comic fans into hardcore comic maniacs but it is a great pre-summer action/adventure film with some comedy and a bit of the eccentric tossed in for good measure.Also worth noting is the cinematography/lighting/production and set design, which is consistently beautiful. The sets are all engaging, from exterior to interiors, urban to expansive countryside ones.As for effects, which are a large part of the film, I can't for the life of me imagine someone claiming that cgi looks 'fake' compared to mechanicals, practicals, stop motion (ala Harryhausen), and so on after they see this film. For my money, these are some of the most impressive cgi creations yet.I won't go into the usual routine and start giving away plot points and story snippet. All I will say is 'Go see the movie'. But before you do you must take all logic, all sarcasm and cynicism and toss those all out of the car window on the way to your local cinemas. This movie has a lot of things that may contradict a lot of things that most people believe in, but remember, ITS JUST A MOVIE. Thats what movies are for, they are meant to take the impossible and make it possible and so on. Like I said, this movie might not be an award winner, and won't be on any critics ten best lists, but it will be a film that you'll laugh at, and generally have fun watching. Its a great escape from the surrealistic existence that many of us live every single day. So, take my advice, go see this movie, sit back, relax, and have some fun. Ironman is captivating, suspenseful and humorous. It is well worth watching for anyone with a taste for fantasy.",Null,1,2,26 February 2009

Many sub characters and backstory based on Star Wars books instead of film canon, I didn't read the SW books so major parentage and plot matters were lost on me. HUGE plot holes saw in this film's plot coming long.
