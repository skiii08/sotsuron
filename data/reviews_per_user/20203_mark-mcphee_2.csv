Skyfall," Great Movie
","Certainly one of the best Bond movies made. Great acting and directing.The film plays tribute to the past 50 years of Bond and has re-introduced some old familiar characters that have been omitted from the past 2 Daniel Craig Bond films.Although this is a great film, the only change I would make would be to have the gun sight moved to the beginning of the film as it was in the first 20 Bond films. I know Sony like to add their own stamp to films, but as a life long fan of the films, Sony, please don't mess too much with the chemistry.The humour in the film is catered to both audiences, from action fan films to die hard Bond fans with subtitle jokes relating to previous films.Again, the Aston Martin is not in the film much unfortunately, but when the DB5 is, it pays tribute to Goldfinger very well.The ending is a bit predictable I found as nearing the last 30-45 mins of the film I twigged what would happen to M and how she was going to be replaced and how Miss Moneypenny would be introduced and who it would be.The addition of Q back into the films was a great thing to see, although the lack of gadgets in comparison to previous Bond films was a bit disappointing but the humour in the scenes with Q reminded me to the Desmond Llewyn/Sean Connery films.The small gripes about the film were mainly from a Bond fan point of view and should not take anything away from an absolutely brilliant film.",10,6,21,27 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope
","Good points about the movie:Cast was great Very funny one linersNow the other bits:Droid escapes the empire with secret plans. This droid is a little funnier than R2 but is basically doing the same role as R2 did in IV. First order destroys village looking for the droid, again very similar to IV MF very conveniently near by to take our new heroes off planet A nice cantina to build the plot line a bit, with the lightsabre of Skywalker nicely stored for our new heroine to start her journey to the way of the Jedi. Very similar to IV, even in a similar chest.You can see a theme emerging here. Even down to the hero getting killed by the evil dark side Lord. Funny enough it was son killing father again. Young Jedi wipes out the Jedi till only 1 remains, sounds very familiar again. All throughout the film, I was guessing correctly what was coming next, there was no massive twist in the film, nothing like episode V. Even down to being told the Kylo is Solo's son and very easy to guess that Rey is most likely Skywalkers daughter.All in all, this was simply a remake of episode IV. The writers were very aware of this as they wrote in references to the rest of the saga as they characters did pretty much what they had done in previous films.I would say that from a story standpoint this is a very disappointing movie. The action and cast were great, but, and I will probably be shot for this, but the graphics in the prequels were a lot more to my liking,The new republic is mentioned and then suddenly wiped out, along with there whole fleet. Just as well they had created a rebel alliance, sorry, resistance to fight off the empire, sorry first order.I can only hope that the next 2 are more original. Everyone criticises Lucas for the changes he made to the original films, yet everyone seems very happy to the changes made to Episode IV in this one???????",1,119,225,17 December 2015
