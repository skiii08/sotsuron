Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A misanthrope's view of humanity.
","This is the worst, most execrable picture I have ever seen. Hateful entrapment parading as documentary, made by a sociopath projecting his own unforgiving limitations upon the rest of humanity. The misanthropy, misogyny, xenophobia, racism, bigotry and more, are palpable. Cohen and Co. seem to forget that it is, indeed, in humanity's job description to be fallible, stupid and cruel: we are a product of our environment. However social mores preclude the sane majority among us from acting out our foibles in public. I don't even want to know the ugly place from whence come the sad auteurs of this waste. Is that where they acquired their taste for coprophagia? The puerile filmmakers would do well to consider the profound difference between laughing at vs. laughing with one's audience. This is the second-only film in my life which I chose to abandon, with no curiosity whatsoever to know if there is a point to it, because there isn't one. This uncompromising bile makes it the single most offensive filmed experience I have witnessed. I could not get home fast enough to shower off this sewer. For shame! Sascha Baruch Cohen's pr insists SBC graduated from Oxford. Not the one in the U.K., surely.",1,17,36,11 November 2006
The Fountain," A myth on the meaning of life, love and death cycle
","Pedestrian ponderous boring kitsch. The story, based on one of humanity's most compelling myths, is contorted into a overwrought and uninspiring story with pseudo-philosophical pretensions. Part of the story is reminiscent of tired TV hospital melodramas. Painted on a dirty dark brown canvas. Tedious direction. Bland acting: one more role and Jackman will o.d. from overexposure. Jackman tries too hard to be a hunk, an artiste and romantic lead and succeeds as neither. Rachel Weisz looks pretty even when reciting her silly lines. The cg effects work for the first 15mins. The picture lacks breadth, is short on imagination and daring. Compassion is confused with cheesy sentimentality. In short: a waste of time.",1,13,29,11 November 2006
Casino Royale," 007 saves the world from bad guys, again (yawn).
","The shoot by numbers formula for this tired franchise is showing its age. The latest installment may resonate with old aficionados and boys who have not yet become addicted to the multitude of electronic options in the 'out there'. Yes, the mainstays are still there: the fetching women, the motherly boss as hen-in-chief, the picture postcard pretty locations, fast cars speeding along busy streets, pockmarked villains... Absent are the outragous and fanciful tools of the trade: has reality caught up with imagination or the writers lack the latter? The new 007, played by the beefed up Daniel Craig, takes himself far to seriously. The charm of the previous incarnations came from the quick wit uttered with a nudge-nudge and a wink- wink. Brains vs brawn was the reason for 007's success among the flaccid plodders tied to a lifetime on the office chain gang. The franchise owners ought to go out into the real world more often: the Sixties are no more. The world is older by two generations and the mores have changed: rethink or retire The Agent.",2,12,39,17 November 2006
La Vie En Rose," a terrible picture made great by a peerless performance
","This is one of the best performances you will ever see. For that reason alone go and see this, otherwise, tedious picture. Ms. Cotillard's performance makes you forget about the dreadful photography, gawdawful direction, cheap set design, astonishing continuity mistakes, and many of the phoned-in perfs, including Depardieu's.Marion Cotillard, with the best make-up job I've seen in a long, long time, takes the audience on a mesmerizing, emotionally draining roller coaster in which you will love, hate, want to scream at, and cry with Marion as Piaf. Ms. Cotillard's performance should be studied by all the wanna-be actors.As for the rest of the picture... The script is pretty awful melodrama, seemingly written in one quick sitting by writers imbued with an over-abundant faith in their (missing) talent. And then, one of the writers decided to direct this cheesy, cheap, messy, dirty-looking and forgettable picture which, without Ms. Cotillard's performance, would have been an instant dud.",7,2,5,28 December 2007
