Deepwater Horizon," Explosively thrilling!
","I feel like the best way of describing this movie would be to call it an 'experience.' I know that every movie, technically speaking, is an experience, but a lot of movies seem to tell us a story with us looking in from the outside of the films events. This film literally places us in the middle of what is happening, and it does so with style!There are a few things about this movie that I really enjoyed. First and foremost, the acting! My word, this is by far the most surprising element of the film for me. Every member of this cast does a good job. The two standout performances come from Kurt Russel and John Malkovich.Kurt Russel is an actor that I haven't seen in ages, and so I'd kind of forgotten about him, but his performance in this movie is so brilliant that it redeems his lack of activity in the past few years. The special effects used for the explosions in this movie are superb. The film has an extremely realistic feel to it, thanks in know small part to the cinematographer Enrique Chediak, who, while rushing things at times, captures moments of beauty at others.This movie also does a great job at portraying the oil rig explosion in a very humane way, getting us to sympathize with the characters and their circumstances.It is just this combination of elements that makes this movie so good. While any other Hollywood director could have made it feel very ungrounded, Peter Berg came and turned it into a thrilling experience with a lot of heart.",7,2,4,4 October 2016
The Birth of a Nation," A classic in every sense of the word.
","To understand and speak about this film, one must first understand the context in which the movie was released. It was early 1915, the mindset of the people was very different to what it is today, the state of the film industry was also completely different. This is important to remember when reading the following review.The Birth of a Nation is undoubtedly one of the most impactful films ever released. Anybody who has done even the slightest bit of research into this film will understand that. However, it is also one of if not the most controversial films ever made. The film cut deep into the hearts of the African Americans particularly, and, after watching this, it's easy to understand why. The racism present in the movie is excruciatingly obvious and in your face. What makes matters worse is that it is also evident that the film-makers weren't trying to make it so, in order to arouse feelings of anger and frustration within us, oh no. Instead, the racism is filmed in a way that proves that it was the norm of that time to think this way about African people. This -frustratingly fundamental- part of the film is what has been the cause for more than a century of controversy. I will say that as a young guy in his twenties - who has grown up in a world that is all about equality of rights of all human beings, no matter what may separate them from ourselves - it was very difficult to sit through the second half of the movie. What is shown is both infuriating and disturbing. However, that's not to take away from the truly spectacular first-half.The first-half of the film really is something to behold. From the brilliant depiction of the events surrounding the Civil War, and that of the war itself, as well as the brilliantly acted romance story that is thrown in between, this movie is thoroughly engaging. The first half of the movie(90 minutes on the 3 hour version that I watched) is expertly crafted and pulled off with a style that was not the norm in the film industry at the time. I can't begin to explain the beauty of Liilan Giths performance in this movie, for my first Gith film, she completely and utterly blew me away. Henry B Walthall is also very impressive as the 'hero' of the film. The cinematic techniques used by all-star director D.W. Griffith were groundbreaking at the time. The ambition and scope of the movie even more so. This was the first time a director had attempted to tell such a big and significant story with so much style and class.My enjoyment of the first half of this movie was more than enough to convince me and win me over to the quality of classic cinema. The racist and sometimes pointless second half did take away from the experience though. If you have an interest in film history and would like to see something that is a deep foundation of the birth of Hollywood, I would most definitely recommend this brilliant, albeit dated cinematic experience.",8,1,2,17 October 2016
Doctor Strange," Average Marvel film.
","The latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe aims to introduce a new character into the mix of thunder gods and talking raccoon's. Doctor Strange is the MCUs first extra-dimensional sorcerer, and, portrayed by the great Benedict Cumberbatch, this character really is brought to us in an engaging way.The film is in the same vein as the other films of this universe. It has the same color palette, and this was great to see. I really like the way it felt like a Marvel film, it made the experience relatable, and helped to keep me engaged throughout the film. However, while I do look at this as a good thing, I feel like the film sort of plays safe the entire time. It is a very generic superhero origin story, and at the very core of the piece, it plays out in a very old-fashioned way. The story tries to explore dimensions which are not of our own, and it does so in a way that makes this concept the center of the entire production. The only problem is, it's still just a Marvel movie, and, operating within the Marvel framework, it is very difficult to see it as anything more than a fun blockbuster.I'm not saying that this is necessarily a bad thing, but I do feel like I was not as blown as I thought I'd be after seeing the trailers released a few months ago. Behind the otherworldly aspects, this is a story no different from any other superhero origin story I've seen. It's all the same thing. A man living a fairly normal life undergoes a certain experience which leads to them discovering that they have changed in some sort of way. Slowly they learn that they have abilities that aren't normal, and over time they learn to use the abilities to defeat a villain. It's all very cliché.On a positive note, this film is visually dazzling and I would recommend it mainly for this reason. Even if the story is cliché, it is still beautiful to watch. The actors all gave great performances and I do think that there are some really cool lines to be heard in the movie.It is definitely not a bad film, but it really didn't blow me away like I thought it would.",5,2,6,8 November 2016
Don't Breathe," Chillingly tense.
","This is a movie that tries to rely on simplicity rather than going into more complicated territory, and it uses the simplicity to try and stir the more natural fears we ALL share. Does it accomplish this? Absolutely!From the get go we as viewers know that the story is about a trio of house burglars who find out that an army vet has a lot of money stashed away in his old and rusty house in a very quiet street, the catch is that the man in blind. The film sets up its characters well enough, particularly the character of Rocky played by the very camera-friendly Jane Levy. We see a glimpse into their lives and what it is that drives them into the house in the first place. I liked this about the movie, but I found myself wanting to see more of the other two as well, and unfortunately we don't get that. The character of The Blind Man is also handled well, perhaps more so than the rest of the cast. Stephen Lang does a fantastic job of portraying this surprisingly complex character. The greatness comes with the slow but steady transformation of our viewpoint of the man, and it is a haunting transformation to say the least.The other strong points of this movie are particularly the well thought out screenplay as well as the sleek cinematography. I am dead serious when I say that this is a genuinely well produced horror/thriller film. The minimalist soundtrack rounds this all off with great style.Now, with all of the positives out of the way, I do need to point out some of the places where the movie doesn't succeed, because, trust me, there are a few of them.The film kicks off with a real strong start, and for the first hour it is almost flawless, however, later in the film the whole thing starts getting a bit much. We are pulverized with twists and turns that sometimes feel like they don't really need to be there, and these actually make the movie drag on a bit when it feels like it should have already reached its climax. The movie then drags on even more in the last ten minutes and by then I had seen enough of the same thing for it to not be quite as exciting as it was in the beginning.The other big problem with this movie is the plot holes. I'm not going to say that there are many of them, but the ones that are there do stand out when you stop to think about them. This is a very chillingly tense movie that was handled with enough care for it to stand out as one of the finest horror films of the year. I was sitting at the edge of my seat for the majority of the film, and it is so originally simplistic in its approach that it ends up delivering a surprisingly scary experience.",6,1,5,18 October 2016
Sausage Party," A totally underwhelming attempt at Adult Animation.
","This is the latest film to join the oh so great Seth Rogen library of stoner style films, which also happens to be animated. The film attempts to bring a new, more adult dimension to commercial animated movie-making, by making it an R-rated raunch-fest. Sadly, it almost completely fails at this goal. It really is a film with very little substance. Ever since this film was released, I've been hearing and seeing an insane amount of hype about it all over the internet, claims that it's a smart and funny animated adult movie. Bearing this in mind, and the fact that I've enjoyed some of the previous films by Seth Rogen and his loyal team of writers, I went into this movie with quite a bit of excitement. The film is about a sausage named Frank, who, along with all of the other shopping items one can possibly find in a supermarket, worship us human beings as gods. They all believe that when they are picked up off the shelf and taken out of the market, they have been 'chosen' and will be entering heaven. Little do they know what we really do to them. As Frank tries to seduce a hot dog bun named Brenda, played by Kristen Wiig, he embarks on a journey of finding his place in the world and reuniting all of the diversified shopping products in order to live together in harmony, away from fear and suffering. The plot is based on a thought provoking concept, that is the purpose of life in a world controlled by systems that we sometimes do not know very much about. It is the extremely crude and obscene humor, which is not always a bad thing in a movie, that, when mixed with this particular plot-line, does not mix well. The film also tries to get creative with the deaths of the various food characters, and while sometimes these are well done, at other times, they're totally pointless, and even nonsensical. The animation gore also gets old pretty quickly. The film tries to get our minds thinking about existence, while at the exact same time throwing at at us all sorts of the exact same thing, which does not extend further than sex jokes with a sprinkle of stoner comedy and underwhelming gore, which all comes out quite immaturely. The good things to be said are mostly on the animation, which can be impressive at times. It is also just cool to see a talking sausage. I found myself appreciating some of the voice acting as well, particularly the voice acting done by Rogen himself, Kristen Wiig, and Michael Cera.That's about it. Sitting here right now, I really can't think of any other things I really liked about this movie. Seth Rogen fans may enjoy it a bit more than I did, but I just could not have much of a good time watching it. All in all, this is a totally unpleasant movie and, when the sex jokes and food-gore are stripped away, this film completely fails to live up to the hype. Fans of this type of humor might take a bit more out of the experience, but anyone else should save their money and time.",4,0,4,14 September 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Weak-but-entertaining monster movie.
","Since this movie was released last Friday, it has garnered a fairly positive reception. Seeing it being talked about so positively aroused an eager interest, mostly due to my love of the King Kong character, which led me to see it a few days ago. Do I think that it lived up to the hype? No. I do not.Now, that does not mean to say that I did not derive any enjoyment from the picture, because I did, but boy, this movie has issues.The movie begins by introducing us to the various characters who are brought together by John Goodman and Corey Hawkins' characters, two men who are leading an expedition to an uncharted island. Once there they inevitably run into the famous ape, as well as some other scary creatures. This is an extremely formulaic plot present in every King Kong movie. However, the problem I had with this film wasn't necessarily over the simple structure, but more so the poor execution of said structure.The human characters feel paper thin and lazily written. The dialogue they are given is even worse. Tom Hiddlestone and Brie Larsson are two particular characters who are given no development whatsoever, yet the movie puts them in situations where it feels like we are supposed to care for them. The only two characters that were given any kind of development were John C. Reilly and Samual L. Jackson. Everyone else felt like they were part of a B-movie.Now, negative out of the way, I must say that Kong and the other creatures on the island are the high-points of the film for me. Everyone one of them feels realistic, with personality. Their movements flow and add weight, particularly with Kong himself. I found myself wanting the monsters on screen whenever they weren't, and I wasn't let down on that end.It's a pity the weak characters take away from the greatness of the titular beast, but it's safe to say that anyone who wants to see King Kong beating the crap out of mysterious monsters will not be disappointed. Just don't expect to remember the movie two weeks down the line.",5,2,6,16 March 2017
13 Hours," Decent in parts, not so much in others.
","13 Hours is the newest movie by Michael Bay, about the 6 U.S security fighters who were stranded in an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, and had to defend themselves against waves of terrorist attacks. I'm going to say that if this is a story you are interested in, it would not hurt to watch it, however, if this is not a story that interests you, stay away!The film is your typical Michael Bay movie, filled with enough explosions to leave your ears ringing, and camera cuts that made me nauseus. Some of the shots of the action scenes are quite good, with some moments where things felt smooth. The rest of the film was a bit of a mess, and ultimately it leaves much to be desired.The acting in this film was very average, but I can't decide if that's the actors faults, or the fact that the characters they play are extremely generic. I mean, I can think of many other war movies where the characters are exactly the same, with different names. I know that Bay is not a director famous for good character development, but I think that these characters should have been fleshed out more for the film to really have the effect it was aiming for.I also think that the constant camera cuts made it very hard to really understand what was going on, especially during the action scenes. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that this is some of the worst cutting I have ever seen.Like I said earlier, some shots did work, and some of the action was enjoyable, especially closer to the end of the film. I also found the soundtrack to suit the feel of the movie quite nicely. Of course, it is a Micahel Bay movie, so I don't need to say that the special effects of explosions and gunfire were good for you to know that they will be at least impressive. Overall, it was not the best time I've had watching a movie, and it could have been done way better than it was. Still, I do believe that people who are into this type of story would get a bit more out of it than I did.",2,17,41,17 September 2016
