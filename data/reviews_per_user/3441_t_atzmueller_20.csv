Skyfall," An utterly worthy sequel to Casino Royale'
","considering that 'Casino Royale' was one of the most brilliant reboots of recent times and considering that the abysmally bad 'Quantum of Solace' was a complete train-wreck of a movie, that could have broken the back of a less established franchise.In 'Skyfall' James Bond finally returns to his roots: there is a new Q (Ben Whishaw, properly nerdish), there's a Ms. Moneypenny (don't tell me you haven't guessed who it is) and, for the future, a new M (Ralph Fiennes, perfectly cast). A revamped Walter PPK and the return of Bonds Aston Martin are pure nostalgia. There's even hints of Moore-Bond-like humour and one-liners; again suitably without seeming forced or tacky. And there is action – plenty of fast-paced, memorable action. In short: 'Skyfall' contains everything that makes a classic Bond picture.Let's talk about the element which makes or breaks a Bond movie: the antagonist. Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre and his bleeding eye did an alright, yet not overly impressive job, and Mr. Greene in 'Quantum' – well, let's be frank about it: a bug-eyed Roman Polanski look-alike with a strong French accent hardly qualifies as 'menacing'. Javier Bardem has played one of the most memorable villains in recent years in 'No Country for Old Men', so expectations where extremely high. And Bardem delivers: the Spanish actor had announced that his Silva would be an amalgamation of various Bond villains and he didn't promise too much, the character having elements and nuances of almost every Bond-foes since Dr. No, be it Zorin, Scaramanga, Alec Trevelyan 006, Gustav Graves and even the iconic henchman Jaws, to name but a few. A classic yet unique Bond adversary, filled to the brim with the charm of the psychopath. If ever there was a Bond opponent worthy of making a return in a potential sequel (which, with the exception of criminal mastermind Blofeld, albeit played by different actors, hasn't happened before), his name be Raoul Silva.Having said all that, what's new about 'Skyfall'? For one, the storyline not only continues to portray James Bond as a realistic figure (and not the cardboard-parody of, say, the Moore- and Brosnan-era). Craig's Bond isn't a near-invincible superhero but a person who has to deal with his inner demons, childhood traumas, and fear of aging, etc; troubles and tribulations that virtually every person can relate too. One of the few problems that some critics had with 'Casino Royale' was the portrayal of Bond as someone who could be described as a borderline-psychopath (which, considering that killing other human beings is how he makes a living, isn't all too far fetched). 'Skyfall' delves deeper into the psychology of James Bond, and especially his relationship to M (Judi Dench, more than ever a surrogate mother-figure to both Bond and Silva).Nothing is perfect and there are minor flaws, which fortunately lie in the eye of the beholder. One could say that the introductory song by Adele Adkins is rather lacklustre, if not to say common. Speaking of product placement, like in previous installations, there's an annoying overkill of thinly veiled ads. Take it from the horses' mouth: despite Bond sipping away on Heineken-Pils, it remains a rather mediocre beer and so I personally will stick with Martini. Shaken, not stirred.Some have criticised that there are 'merely' two Bond-girls in 'Skyfall' (not counting Bardem, whom joksters have described as the 'first male Bond-girl') and despite Naomie Harris being cute as a button, the grimacing and facial contortions of Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) personally made me fear that she was about to suffer from a stroke at any moment.But as said: nothing is perfect and so I give it 8 from 10 points and the distinct hope that tomorrow never dies and Daniel Craig will keep his license to kill, live and let die on her Majesty's Secret Service for a long time to come. (Forgive me, I simply couldn't resist).",8,12,23,13 November 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Christoph Waltz - an Oscar performance within a pile!
","It's a useless thing to post a review on a movie that already has more than a thousand reviews on IMDb. But the division between people who loved it and those who hated it is rather fascinating so I'll add my two cents.I'm a person who's of the later opinion. I just don't like Tarantino and his way of making an 'homage' to me just seems like a cheap way of stealing stuff, that's not known or obscure at best for a mainstream audience but insults the true fan.I'm also a fan of 'alternate realities'-story lines (I recommend Ian McKellen in 'Richard III', taking the age-old Shakespeare play into the time of WW2) and not necessarily too concerned with historic accuracy. In my mind, one could have done something with the story of 'Inglorious Basterds' but what ruins it in this film is the horrible acting.Not even talking about Brad Pitt hamming it up like it really was a real grind house film but what in the heavens could have provoked any director to put Eli Roth in front of a camera? I realise that there isn't much real acting involved in a homage to exploitation flicks but at least a little charisma, a little character for an protagonist in a mainstream movie – is that too much to ask for? We now move on to the German imports: Till Schweiger, Daniel Brühl and Gedeon Burkhard. Schweiger divides the audience in Germany. He's by fans depicted as the Ben Affleck of German cinemas; by adversaries he's considered as a German version of Ben Affleck who's performance is annoying but who can produce a sellable love comedy during Summer. Brühl is another actor who leaves critics divided. 'A great talent in the making', say some; 'an actor with a steady repertoire of four facial expressions', say the others (three of which are featured in 'Inglorious Basterds'. And of course Burkhard, prior to 'Inglorious Basterds' a regular in many-a daily soap-opera that are geared toward pensioners and the unemployed. The rest of the cast is relatively unknown to me and I'm relative grateful for that. And, adding insult to injury for hammy acting and lazy direction: the caricature of Hitler and his regime, just a few years after an audience has applauded the performances of Bruno Ganz and others in 'Der Untergang'.I give this film four stars  no, I give the actor Christoph Waltz four stars. And another Oscar  because he deserves it. Skills and a presence that rivals performances of contemporary roles like Heath Ledger as the Joker or Javier Badem in movies like 'No Country for Old Men' and 'The Sea Inside'. That's the fascinating aspect about the movie: putting up 1st class actors against 2nd and 3rd rate: the result is 'Inglorious Basterds'.",4,15,28,20 October 2010
Hostel," Cult movie without Cult factor
","By the dawn of the 21st century, there had been a number of very low budgeted films ('Saw', 'Cube', to name but two) who were, despite all shortcomings, able to breathe some fresh wind into the stagnant genre of splatter-horror. 'Hostel' was one of those films but, considering that both 'Saw' and 'Cube' had their moments of brilliance, I could not for the life of me say what the 'Hostel'-hype was all about. The story of American students travelling Europe – oblivious that Europe isn't a country and that there are differences between Bratislava, Amsterdam and Paris – in search for the ultimate joyride, is well-worn. In 'Hostel', our protagonists fall in with a ring of gangsters running what can best be described as a 'snuff-club', where rich patrons pay heft amounts to live out their murderous fantasies. 'Hostel' sure has its moments, mainly those concerning themselves with realistically simulated tortures and killings, but that's all 'Hostel' got running for it. I'm not going to talk about uncharismatic lead actors, lack of artistic talents or the pretentious style of directing; I want to talk about bloopers. See, I'm not a very bright viewer and am virtually blind to things like errors, bloopers and inconsistencies. No, I never noticed that Charlton Heston was wearing his wrist watch in 'Ben Hur'. I'm completely oblivious and I don't even care – until it comes to the issue of 'Hostel':The film is riddled with errors to such an extent that after about 40 minutes I asked myself say, 'dude, is this a joke'? Yes, partly it was. I remember director Roth explain that the constantly changing make-up of the Japanese girl in virtually every shot was intended because he wanted to do something to the audience – not sure what the purpose was because eventually my brain turned off to the rambling, having too often heard shoddy workmanship disguised as artistic innovation. So how did this c-grade production ever become 'cult' or hyped in the first place? Well, it would probably never have seen the cinematic light of day if it hadn't come with the over-sized headline screaming: 'presented by Quentin Tarantino' and to Tarantino fans it seems to be all gold that shines (or rather has the moniker 'presented by Quentin Tarantino').I'd give it 2 points from 10 for a couple of the gore effects but that's where the sympathy stops.",2,2,4,1 February 2012
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," All posing and CGI-action, but little heart and no soul
","'X-Men' was one of the few superhero comic-book-adaptations that actually worked. It wasn't so much the special effects, it was the 'human-factor', depicting the mutants as people with special powers, who invariably had to pay the price for those powers (Rogue, unable to touch another being without (almost) killing them; Cyclops inability to look at anybody without his glasses and Wolverines pain, whenever his claws would surface, etc). Perhaps the older generation remembers a David Cronenberg movie called 'Scanners'. Same story: ordinary people with extraordinary powers and the terrible price they had to pay for those (unasked-for) powers – 'Scanners' was all about the people; the sequels were all about their powers.Hugh Jackman goes through the motions in the role, for which he'll most be remembered but, by now, the 'Wolverine' character has become an action-figure of itself: again, the human factor missing. We could relate to him in 'X-Men', where the pain of memory loss and retractable claws were ever-present; in 'Wolverine' he's almost a caricature of his own character.Highlights are Liev Schreiber as antagonistic 'Sabretooth' (diabolical yet strangely amiable at the same time), the 'Blob' as comic-relief character (in the comics he strikes as more tragic) and Dominic Monaghan in a short, but poignant guest-role. Ryan Reynolds is playing the same role he's been playing since the beginning of his career: 'Ryan Reynolds playing Ryan Reynolds as  (add your pick here)', in the case of 'Wolverine', 'Deadpool'. He does it well, being a mix of his likable self and the cynical 4th wall breaking Mutant of the comic – in the first part, that is; during the last part he plays like some run-off-the-mill killer-machine, raising the question whether the producers have actually read any 'Deadpool'-Comics. Apart from Sabretooth, most of those characters appear predominantly during the first quarter of the movie, which is the strongest part. The rest concentrates on Wolverines origin story, which, it begs the question, is actually quiet unnecessary, even unwanted, considering that the 'enigma of Wolverine' in the original Film is what makes him such an interesting character. It's like filming a prequel to 'The Dark Knight', where it is revealed that the Joker used to be a janitor, driven insane by the rejection of a former girlfriend.As is often the case, 'more' isn't necessarily 'better'. Sure, an army of superheroes works in a comic-book – just read 'Kingdom Come' – but it doesn't translate well into film. Again, it may flatter the hardcore fan, to spot cameos of numerous 'X-Men' characters, but on film, it just convolutes the picture. I never cared whether Cyclops, Emma Snow or Quicksilver appeared in the film – I wanted to see a film about the character Wolverine.I'll give it 6 well-meaning points from 10.",6,0,1,26 January 2013
The Doors," The Doors – where good music divides itself from the Justin Gagas and Lady Biebers
","I've heard and read much criticism about Oliver Stones 'The Doors'-biopic. The shortest may have been 'I'm nobody, I'm drunk and depressed; I'm famous, I'm drunk and depressed. I'm fat, I'm drunk and depressed and I'm famous and dead' (presumably no longer drunk and depressed). Others have criticized that Val Kilmer looks nothing like the real 'Lizard King', or that the story adds little new to story of both band and singer. That may to an extent be all true that 'The Doors' is an excellent film.At the same time I have to warn that is by no means an objective opinion. See, I come from a generation where the music of 'Pink Floyd', 'The Rolling Stones', 'The Who' and 'The Doors' was an integral part of growing-up. It didn't even matter that Jim Morrison had already been dead for more than 20 years. See, it was a divided time, where honest music had become scare and channels like MTV had just begun their barrage of intolerable, artificially-hyped fluff (little did we know of the horrors to still come). So there was the alternative between this Pop, some contemporary honest Rock- and Metal-acts like 'Guns N'Roses' or 'Nirvana', and of course the 'Golden Oldies' from father's tape- and record-collection. This was all zealously played on the weekends and when Oliver Stones 'The Doors' finally arrived on videotape, this too was zealously watched before, during and often after various parties. As said: Good times that stand between an objective review.How true to the fact Stones film is, let historians and people from the era decide that. Fact is, that the film captured the essence of the time, the 1960's and 70's, at least to the point where we viewers, who weren't around then, would like to envision it. We cared little about the social-upheaval of the time, the Flower-Power-movement or Vietnam; we cared about honest Rock-music, epic performances and one of the most charismatic band-leaders of the time. All this we got in both the music and the film itself. Again, it is true that Val Kilmer optically didn't look much like Morrison but the performance went far beyond anything that has since (and after) been given by many look-alike characters. Kilmer even did the unthinkable: singing most of the material himself and emulating the Lizard King to a tit. Yes, after a few moments Kilmer has convinced us that he IS Morrison, by virtues of acting, not make-up or special-effects. Indeed, a performance that would have deserved more praise and awards than it got.If there's any criticism from my side, it may be that the film is too short. Not just from a fans perspective, who would have spent some more time with Jim, Ray and the other boys (all superbly acted by all involved, included extras and cameos), but because we would have wished to learn a little more about the enigma that was Jim Morrison. Like Oliver Stone once said himself (paraphrasing here): 'A movie is two hours and you cannot condense a persons full life to two hours'. Sure, there must have been more to Morrison than the fast-living hellraiser and drunken hoodlum-poet in the movie, but more often it's what left out from a persons life rather than what's been meticulously shown that turns a life into a legend. That's a balance that Oliver Stone got just right and hence the film gets a very subjective 8/10 from me.",8,2,2,24 December 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," This movie is like a burger at 'McDonalds' – it tastes like the last one, the one before that and the one you'll taste in the future
","Funny how, sometimes, movies can make you depressed. Not the movie 'Captain America' itself – that left me rather unimpressed, indifferent, despite being a comic book fan – but the thought: $X millions spent on a film, $XX millions made and XXX bad reviews later, there'll be XXXX sequels! Many reviewers have pointed out the merits of this film – sure, there are merits, if you don't have the highest of expectations, but why bother pointing them out? It's like pointing out that the last 'McDonalds'  you ate was delicious; instead of saying that it tasted just as average as any other McD's burger you've ever eaten.Instead of saying, 'Chris Evans made a great Captain America', we could just say, 'He wasn't as corny as the Human Torch'. We could say, 'Hugo Weaving did a great job playing the Red Skull', or we could stick to the truth and say, 'Hugo Weaving is playing the same damn role, he's been playing for the last ten years' – eyebrows go up, corner of mouth goes down, cheesy lines are recited, etc.As to CGI, well, I've never been a fan and still consider most CGI-effects bland, lifeless or blatantly obvious, but have to admit: the character of 'Peggy Carter' was almost lifelike. The wonders of modern technology (I assume the character was voiced by someone called Hayley Atwell)? Sorry, Mr. Lee, there'll be no more bucks coming from this sucker  oh well, not entirely true: I'll stick to the grab-bags at the local comic-store. After all, 50 cents for five issues of 'The Avengers'-comics isn't too much to ask for.3 from 10",3,2,4,5 March 2012
The Village," A tale of fail and a 'Village'-idiot
","I have to admit, the first time I watched The Village', I quiet liked it. For some reason it reminded me of Tim Burtons 'Big Fish', had this fairy-tale-ish quality that's very rare among Hollywood movies; I thought that Adrien Brody did a good job.I have to admit, the first time I watched 'The Village' I had a little too much wine that evening.Then I watched it a second time – sober – thinking to myself, 'What the hell am I watching here? And why am I watching this?' A storyline that is so hackneyed, you might suspect that it has been written by a 3rd grader and a finishing twist that seems to have been pulled out of an orifice that IMDb won't allow me to name here. No, I'm not going to count up the plot-holes – look, there's already more than 1,000 reviews on this page, most of them talking about the plot-holes and inconsistencies (the handful of positive reviews are probably written by Manoj Nelliyattu himself or people suffering from delusions).Generally we have a cast of able actors but, as is the case in almost all film productions, the director is the boss and if the director tells the actor, 'act weird' or 'recite these lines, whether they make sense or not', well, the actor hasn't got much of a choice. So don't blame those poor sods; the blatant nonsense you'll be watching has grown on the manure pile of director Shyamalan.See, Shyamalan used to be an able director – not brilliant but good, who knew how to make an average-to-good film. Unfortunately, at one point in time the young director begun to believe in his own hype and began directing film despite better knowledge and common sense. Megalomania is actually a real psychological disorder that's clinically treatable – but throwing a million dollar budget at somebody afflicted and confirming his mania, that's called enabling, and that is what Hollywood's soulless executives are essentially guilty of. 'The Village' was just the beginning and the final result (until this point in time) can be seen in 'The Last Airbender'.You, dear reader, may have come under the impression that I harbor a certain animosity toward the director. I assure you, that is not the case. I wish M. Night Shyamala nothing but the best, that he may one day recover and find his spot in the industry where he belongs and where his work will be appreciated – in Bollywood cinema.Years later I would watch a spoof-scene in one of the 'Scary Movies' films – pretty much summons up that train-wreck of a movie that is 'The Village'.I have to give a mandatory one point, so I try to console myself by saying that I give it to Brody, who has to play 'The Village' idiot – out of pity.",1,1,4,22 February 2013
District 9," Politically Correct, it's a great film - realistically it isn't
","I could imagine following scenario: Producer: 'How did you like the film?' Critic: 'This piece of crap is the shoddiest, plagiarizing' Producer: ' it's an allegory about apartheid, by the way.' Critic stops dead in his tracks: ' most amazing, beautiful movie I have ever seen! 10 Points!'I don't know, perhaps age makes suspicious but I tend to approach movies where the largest part of the poster says, 'Celebrity X presents a Y movies' with suspicion. Say, for example, if the poster exclaims 'Quentin Tarantino presents a movie by director so-and-so', it's a virtually guarantee that the movie is guano. (Same goes for film-posters where the directors' name is spelled bigger than the actual title but that's another story). So, what we got here? You're average run of the mill science fiction flick (of course PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON!) that does a whole lot of borrowing. Did I just say borrowing? Pardon me; I'm having too kind a day. Let's call the rose by its name then and call it outright stealing. Why, surely very few people have ever heard off or seen David Cronenbergs 'The Fly' or 'Aliens' or 'Robocop'? 'Rambo', 'Transformers', 'E.T.' or even 'Dance with the wolves', who'd every notice a young aspiring director 'borrowing' from such obscure flicks? But perhaps I'm reading too much into the film and those little borrowed moments are pure coincidence – and perhaps PETER JACKSON, who PRESENTS this film, has simply missed those parts. To be honest, after having seen uncounted war world 2 and apartheid dramas, watching another SA apartheid film (even if it's thinly veiled as science fiction) provoked the same sentiment as watching another apologetic German movie about Hitler: utter boredom sets in. Alright, we all got it: apartheid was wrong, a great crime against humanity and all that  now, could we get on with something fresh, please? Pretty please? But let's speak about the main-factor of the film: it's being PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON! What makes this a Jackson film? Well, primarily gore – which is a good thing if you have a taste for cinematic gore but the blood and entrails here are obviously and painfully computer animated, it leaves the watcher with the same expression a meat-connoisseur might have after being presented with a tofu burger. Plus, there's a scene where a soldier is hit by a flying sheep – if that isn't a tribute to New Zealand, I don't know what is. I'd give a couple of points but only because that is one of the few South African science fiction movies, so here goes for the exotic factor. Not to mention a bonus-point because this film was PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON!Oh, did I mention that this film was PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON? You know PETER 'Lord of the Rings' JACKSON? Now go run off, buy the DVD, buy the Blue-Ray and don't forget to dig in for the merchandize – or save your cash for a better flick.",3,12,21,8 September 2011
2012," The CGI-animations have more soul than the actors – and the animations aren't very good.
","Let's not waste too many words on the hackneyed script, the plot-holes, inconsistencies or cheap CGI-effects that make this film near unpalatable; too many ranting reviews have gone down that path already. Rather, let's talk about the psychology of director Roland Emmerich: The more Emmerich products one watches, the more one gets the impression that Emmerich is somewhat of a misanthrope. How else could we explain that the director casting actors that are complete cardboard cut-outs of 'real' people? Cusack, Peet, pretty much the entire crew with the exception of Danny Glover (who seems unable to play characters that are not amiable or sympathetic) seem like robots that mimic human behaviour. Or perhaps it's true that Californians are so shallow, that they have difficulties interacting like the rest of humanity, merely going through the motions.Each and every character is a crudely drawn stereotype, be it the ever-humble Indian scientist, the Dalai Lama-like Buddhist monk, the African-American president brimming with benevolence (and again, Glover plays the part way more convincing than the president who plays the part currently), the boxer-cum-super-billionaire Russian and his spoiled brood, the crazed, borderline psychotic blogger (then-again, Woody Harrelson has been reduced to that role for a long time), etc, etc, etc. Even Cusacks 'kids' don't seem like real children but rather child-actors who've been bred for the sole purpose of following the directors instructions: 'Right, now open the eyes wide and gaze at the camera in shock. Wider! Act more like an adult; and then, play a little girl!' The rest of the story consists 99 percent of Cusack escaping the end of the world (in other words: the grumbling floor) via cars, planes and, in the end, arcs. All this isn't even very exciting because we already know that this is a cut-out summer blockbuster where the hero and his family will escape, no matter what odds, save the day and, as certain as tomorrows sunrise, that there'll be a cheesy happy-end.The glee with which Emmerich 'destroys' various US landmarks (and specifically California) leaves only one conclusion: the director would much rather be home in his scenic, idyllic Stuttgart (which is a city in Germany, in case you're reading this in the US). But, hell, money is money and money doesn't stink; and which other Film-Industry apart from the soulless Hollywood factory would give a director like Emmerich a budget to produce his template flicks? Is there a plan for 'Independence Day 2' or '2013' already? Because if there isn't, have no doubts: there will be eventually.3/10 points.",3,1,2,26 January 2013
Into the Wild," How the hipsters would like to view reality Or What is a martyr for some people, is a Darwin-Award-winner for others
","First, let me begin to say that I'm rather perplexed by the high rating here on IMDb and that this film is in the Top-250 range. But perhaps I shouldn't be. Not if one considers, that many an impressionable teenager and young adult since the films release has equally ran off into the wild, presumably in order to perish like their idol.To tell the whole story in a few simple terms: Bright young teenager Chris McCandless is sick and tired or living in luxury, decides that the materialism of his background is not for him. He abandons his family, savings and worldly possession, taking off on a road-trip, that will take him across half the country, eventually leading him to an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness. There Chris hopes for the sanctuary and natural living that he has for so long desired, but instead starves (the movie opts for the theory that McCandless succumbed to eating poisonous plant) in his sleeping-bag and, after being found by moose-hunters, his ashes are shipped back to his family. The End.We could call this the rich-kid's version of 'Easy Rider', but rather, another film comes to mind namely Werner Herzogs 'Grizzly Man'. Equally based on a true story, with a similar tragic end. However, Herzog (and most of those being interviewed by Herzog) do not stylize the subject or try to make Timothy Treadwell looks like anything other than what he was: a full-blown narcissist with less common-sense than your average lapdog, who was literally begging for some hungry bear to come by and consume him (eventually having his wish granted and taking down his girlfriend with him in the process). Sean Penn chooses another approach. His 'Alexander Supertramp' - the nome de guerre Chris McCandless - is a martyr, if not the template for a hipster-martyr. But Penn doesn't seem able to describe what this particular form of martyrdom should be. Should be pity McCandless? Because his parents are rich, but shallow, and quarrel a lot among themselves? Who could imagine a fate more horrible than that? There's a telling scene in the beginning, where young Chris contemplates the misery and misfortune of his parents wanting to buy him a new car. His refusal to accept this gift is interpreted by Penn as an act of rebellion. Sorry people, ain't buying. These are sentiments that are reserved for the Upper-10,000's, who can afford the luxury of disdaining money (since they have enough of it anyway) and claim that a bout of depression caused by boredom equals the suffering of a Christ on a crucifix.Some of the movie could have worked as your typical road-movie and coming-of-age story. Except: the figure of Chris McCandless never comes to come-of-age. He sets out with the determination of somebody who has already consumed the entire bowl of knowledge, culled entirely from a book-shelf. On his way he bestows shallow wisdom and platitudes to all that cross his path (well-meaning hippies; simple, yet down to earth farmhands; a lonely veteran and a horny, under-aged trailer-trash chick), Never once does our protagonist considering things like responsibility - perhaps for your friends and family, who are worried sick about not knowing where or how Chris is - or even the consequences of action. Like, finding certain death in the inhospitable wilderness. In other words, the character of Chris seems to have respect for only one thing in the world: his own intellect, which he considers superior since, you know, he has read a lot of books, from Tolstoy to Jack London. Again, I remind you, we are supposed to root for this character. Did the real Chris McCandless have a death-wish? Did he subliminally commit suicide without having to get his hands dirty? Or did he suffer from a mental-illness, like paranoia or schizophrenia? Much of the evidence that has been presented since, point toward those directions. Yet, the film chooses to ignore each and every one and goes with the martyr-figure right to the end.So, despite the film having redeeming factors on the technical side, the moral of the story escapes me. What should have been a cautionary tale, is presented as a triumph, where the ultimate fail is portrayed as a victory. Victory over what? Common sense? I'd give it a 4/10-rating for beautiful cinematography, nice editing, good soundtrack (even though to some the Eddie Vedder-compositions may end up sounding too schmaltzy) and the occasional good performance. But these are just technical aspects, that camouflage the utter lack of substance or meaning that is deeper than the bottom of a tea-cup.",4,5,6,3 May 2015
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," One can love it or hate it, but one cannot deny it's a masterpiece that has stood the test of time
","Who still reads de Sade? My guess would be that the Marquise has preciously few readers nowadays. That doesn't mean that his works are no longer relevant or even obsolete, but as far as the literacy value goes: de Sade was a keen thinker and analyst, but no literary giant. The language, even in the best translations, is so outdated, that one would almost speak about a dead language. One must pay respect to directors like Pier Pasolini to have kept the spirit and ideas behind de Sades work alive in a contemporary form.The magic of Pasolinis film-making is, despite sticking to the original ideas of de Sade, he leaves enough space for the viewer to form his own opinions and interpretations. Some have seen 'Salo' as Pasolinis views on fascism and the abuse of power, which may well be true considering the directors political orientation. However, when I had watched the infamous 'excrement-banquet'-scene for the first time and contemplated the victims complete lack of any resistance, I had to think straight of contemporary pop-culture, that is so readily gobbled up by an unresisting youth. Be it the latest shallow blockbuster, reality-TV, some YouTube-generated Pop-monstrosity or even right down to the nearest fast-food-joints – yes, there is plenty of Pasolinis 'special recipe' going around and most of us are demanding a second serving without complaining. Quiet the opposite.Much vitriol has been passed over Pasolinis final film, no further must you look than this review board. Outrage and disgust seem to prevail, both at the images and the motivation of script and director. Sure, opinions are like nostrils (to put it polite): we all have them and are entitled to one. That 'Salo' is a piece of art however, that is no opinion that is a fact. Whether the viewer feels titillated or repulsed by what they're seeing, that is completely different issue. At least I don't know the law or book that dictates that art, philosophy or intellectual discourses have to be beautiful or uplifting.Despite what your personal opinion about the director, the film or his content may be – there is no denying that it is a cinematic masterpiece and will be watched (and argued about) long, long after 90 percent of today's popcorn-cinema has disappeared into oblivion. 9/10",9,4,6,16 November 2014
Detroit Rock City," Let's hope it will stay the last KISS-Film. Can't improve perfection
","KISS isn't known to be the most giving band in the world. Sure, you get your money's worth, but don't expect anything more or something like a free autograph or a 'hi, how are u doing' from the last remaining original members without taking out your wallet first. That seems particularly true these days, where the band still produces tours and albums on the sole premise that most fans are completists, who cannot suffer holes in their collections. So, 'Detroit Rock City' was one of the last few cases where the fan had the feeling that this was produced by band & fans for fans and not only for cash.Sure, I had rooted for this film when it came out and sure, as a kid I had my room plastered with KISS-posters, wore KISS-Make-Up during Halloween and religiously bought most things that bore the distinct logo (despite the design being altered in Germany, because it resembled the SS-Runes a little too close, suggesting that Mr. Chaim Wietz and Mr. Stanley Eisen were Nazis). Got my dad to smuggle me into 'Runaway', despite being a few years short of admission (and I didn't want to go see this film because I'm fond of Tom Selleck). Thinking of it, my parents probably bought Gene Simmons a new Cadillac, despite nowadays I'd hope that this money went into the pockets of either Ace Frehley or Peter Criss.By the time 'Detroit Rock City' hit the cinema, it had pretty much been clear to even the hardened fan, that 90 percent apart from the music was hype and that the two founding members had begun to view their band more of a cash-milking-cow rather than a vehicle to transport good music. But why drop a lifelong habit? Like Richard Linklaters 'Dazed and Confused', Adam Rifkin was able to capture the feel and air of the time 'When KISS ruled the world', which is only one aspect that makes the film work. Though by the time I was old enough to get into the concerts KISS had already taken off their iconic make-up, one could really get a feel of what the great KISSteria must have been like. Then there is the humour: I'm not easily moved to laugh tears at slapstick, but I have to admit that a heartily laughed more than once. The priest and the mushroom-pizza, the clash between KISS-Fans and Disco-Guidos or the Hawk stripping for cash, it all made me crack up. As a bonus, there are plenty of KISS Insider-jokes, from the names of the protagonists to the dialogue; it should be abundantly clear: Adam Rifkin knows his KISS.When talking to the fans, the issue of a sequel would invariably come up. Despite still being a fan-boy deep inside, rationality keeps saying that this just wouldn't work – as little as KISS worked after 1982. What would people like to see? Our four protagonists being in college and moaning the fact that KISS has degenerated into a run-of-the-mill Glam band during the 80's? Having settled down to a blue-collar-existence and taking their kids to see the KISS-reunion in the 90's or having to witness the gold-digging sham that KISS has degenerated to in recent years? No, it's good that 'Detroit Rock City' is (and will likely remain) a one-time-thing – could be a lesson there for Simmons and Stanley.7/10",7,0,0,24 December 2014
The Happening," Like watching Grass grow – a shymal pardon, shamble of a movie.
","Right, The Sixth Sense' was an OK movie – entertaining, had a clever twist in the end but generally overrated. Same goes for 'Unbreakable': an alright film which would have benefited from a director who's knowledgeable in the field of comic book adaptations (to mind comes Zack Snyder or Christopher Nolan'. There was a reason I didn't walk out on 'Signs': they were showing it onboard an airplane, during mid-flight.Then came 'The Village' which, despite all the harsh critiques it received, still has elements of cinematic magic, making it (similar to Tim Burton's 'Big Fish') an on screen-fairy tale. 'The Lady in the Water' shattered all hopes of repeating this magic; it being one of the most pretentiously self-important film I've ever seen – the only film I've ever given one point (just because there is no 0 points on IMDb).Naturally, I was more than a little suspect when I slid 'The Happening' into the DVD-player and was not disappointed: I had expected that it would be crap.What speaks for 'The Happening'? The soundtrack and, if gore is your thing and you're into films like 'Final Destination' or 'Saw', a few nasty, imaginative death-scenes.Otherwise gifted actors, wasted like rotting hay. Dialogues that will make your toes curl and a storyline so hackneyed, it often makes you wonder: 'Is this a joke?' (It wasn't a particularly funny joke though, since I paid good money to see this film). 'The Happening' suffers from the same type of cancer that has killed (most) of above mentioned films, and the name of the cancer is M. Night Shyamalan. Perhaps the director would have turned out a half-decent filmmaker one day, had he not been poisoned by believing his own hype. Perhaps we shouldn't blame the young director but rather the studio-executives and producers, who may have said something cringe worthy along the lines: 'Yeah, this is good stuff', giving it green light. I wish the director all the best for the future and that he may finally conquer a market that would really appreciate his works –Bollywood cinema is full of colours and ripe with symbolism.I didn't bother watching Shyamalans 'Avatar' but I heard it was pretty bad; No big surprises there either. Will I go and watch 'After Earth'? That really depends on what they're willing to pay me.3 points from 10: one for the score, one for the lawnmower scene (which made me laugh, though I believe that was unintentionally) and one for  well, the sun is shining and I'm in a particularly giving mood.",3,2,4,4 April 2012
The Godfather: Part III," An open letter to Francis Ford Coppola
","'Dear Francis, The two of us go way back. Back as far as 'The Terror' and 'Dementia 13'. Then, 'Apocalypse Now' and 'The Cotton Club' – the term cult-movies must have been invented for those two! 'The Ousiders' is still one of my wife's' favourite films and the underrated 'Finian's Rainbow' remains one of my childhood favourites. I even went and watched 'Captain EO' – not because I'm a Michael Jackson fan but because I was a believer in the Coppola magic. And of course 'The Godfather', part 1 and 2, that defined not only the mafia-genre but cinema as we know it today.But then, one night while watching 'The Sopranos', having Chianti and homemade cannelloni, I had to think about something that I had tried to suppress for years: the time when I went to the cinema to watch 'Godfather 3'. Didn't even bother to watch the trailer, didn't noticing that there was no Robert Duval; I just ran off and bought a ticket. Sure, there was no way you could have cast John Cazale, him being as dead as the character Fredo; but replacing the Tom Hagen character with George Hamilton, now that ads insult to injury. Was neither Ed O'Neill nor Ted Danson available? You could have just cast Pee-Vee Herman and make it obvious that this is a farce! Perhaps you wanted to teach us something about 'famiglia italiani' (and/or the structure of the mafia); perhaps you wanted to teach us a lesson about nepotism. There most have been a reason for casting your daughter Sophia in one of the leading roles but I just could never figure out what it was. If anything, her presence excuses Andy Garcia's ham-acting – nothing but silent-movie grimacing could have prevailed against Sophia's proboscis that constantly permeates the picture.'Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder', like they say and I'm not so hard-hearted as to call your daughter ugly like a blind horse – nor would I dare to compare her lips to overcooked blood-sausage or her nose to a bulbous potato but I dare say that her acting stinks to high heaven. What made you put her next to actors like Al Pacino or Eli Wallach and couldn't you have rather made them wear red clown noses? Perhaps you had a point about incest and cousin-relationships – however, I never got them since a) I didn't care, expecting the third part of 'Godfather' and not an incestuous soap-opera and b) well, like I said: Sophia's performance made me think about many things – a stacked ham-sandwich was among them but sex wasn't.Here, now I've said it: it wasn't only general miscasting or dour, convoluted and essentially boring story lines that killed the movie beyond hope for resurrection – it was Sophia! You went on to direct 'Dracula' and like a dying bull in Pamplona, you seemed to have risen one final, forceful time – yes, 'Dracula' would remain one of the last good vampire flicks until today. Then came films like 'Jack' (best left uncommented) and 'Supernova', which you wanted to direct under the moniker 'Alan Smithee' but Walter Hill had already adopted it for the same pile of manure.Francis, I'd like to thank you for all the great movies prior to 'Godfather 3' and wish you a long, happy life. May the Californian sun help you produce the choicest Cabernet Sauvignon that will forever keep your table filled with Italian delicacies.Just please, Francis, stop directing movies!' Three noses  excuse me, I meant three points from ten.",3,8,13,14 December 2011
The Last King of Scotland," Great performances and wasted opportunities
","Although the life and times of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin was as fascinating as it was disastrous for the Ugandan citizens, only two movies about Amins reign come to mind: 'Raid on Entebbe', featuring the charismatic Yaphet Kotto as Amin and 'Rise and Fall of Idi Amin', which was primarily an exploitation film.Hoping for an authentic film with an impressive cast, I had high expectations for 'The Last King of Scotland' since I had seen Forrest Whitaker in the trailer but left slightly disappointed.Let me first say, Whitaker is excellent (and nobody was more deserving to win the Oscar) playing what may well become the role of his life – but people familiar with the real Idi Amin will find very little similarity between the real dictator and Whitakers performance.On the weak sides are actors James McAvory and Gillian Anderson (who has little to do but to confirm that McAvorys character is a wife-stealer); McAvorys is given the role of Dr. Garrigan whom the script dooms to be a very shallow and unsympathetic character, often making the viewer wonder why they would root for such a protagonist.Apart from Simon McBurney, playing a suitably slimy Stone, the movie is carried by very strong African actors like David Oyelowo or Stephen Rwangyezi but none given more than fleeting screen time. Instead, the film centres on the main characters, often forgetting to show us the real implications of Amins action: the effects it had on Uganda, its economy, social structure and its people. The viewer would like to see more about life in Kampala but only gets to see corrupt politicians and, of course, the few Ugandan wives that Dr. Garrigan seduces. Essentially it's two hours of Whitaker, a (no pun intended) rather pale McAvory and many wasted opportunities.If you want to see an excellent performance and a thriller along the lines of 'Blood Diamonds', 'The Last King of Scotland' is an excellent movie. If you want to see the real Idi Amin, I recommend you documentaries like 'General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait'.7 from 10",7,0,1,14 December 2011
X-Men: First Class," Suspicious, weary and predetermined I saw the movie – and was surprised! Pleasantly surprised!
","The first 'X-Men' movie from 1999 was one of the few comic-book adaptations that actually worked! The second part, almost as expected, was 'so-so' and the third, well, best not to loose too many words. Then came the abysmal 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', and pretty much all hope for a dignified continuation of the series was lost. Plus, the current season offered a whole squad of mediocre comic book adaptations; 'Captain America', 'Thor', 'The Avengers', just to name a few of the heart- and soulless CGI-abominations that have come to your cinema these days.So, expectations for a re-boot of 'X-Men' (which, despite all nods to the original series, it is) weren't all too high; didn't even bother watching it in cinema – which turned out to be a mistake.'X-Men Origins: First Class' is the first film, that comes anywhere close to the charm of the original. The fan was generally worried about not seeing any of the original characters played, say, by Patrick Steward or Ian McKellan – they need not worry: the chemistry (the magical word in 'X-Men' 1999) between the cast is first-rate. I didn't like James McAvoy that much in 'The Last King of Scotland' and hadn't seen much of Michael Fassbender, other than his small role in 'Inglorious Basterds' – here, as the future Dr. X and Magneto, they're both excellent. And Dr. X isn't even bald! Word had spread among geeks that there would be a guest-appearance of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and the word was right. We might come to expect pretentious, predictable cameos like, say, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis appearing in 'The Expendables'. Rather, Jackman and Romijn appearances combined, last less than 10 seconds, yet are so well placed and timed; it almost made this fan applaud. Chemistry and timing; the director succeeded, where the last three parts have failed.The character of Azazel, the red-skinned demon mutant, is one of the let-downs of the movie. First of all, (considering that Alan Cumming played an excellent Nightcrawler in 'X-Men 2'), there really was no need to create a duplicate in red. Sure, Azazel is Nightcrawlers biological father in the comics, giving rise to potential future story lines, but the supernatural and mutant powers didn't mix so well in on paper, and they do less so-so film.Special praise would go to Kevin Bacon: his arrogant, self-sure Sebastian Shaw character (who, in the comics is often one of the blander villains), works perfect as antagonist of this film – and his demise is actually rather brutal and memorable. Bravo (again, said in a geekish tone – but, as in everything, the geek is capable of finding some faults: Bacons German accent is atrocious).There was even an unexpected bonus: waiting for the extra-scene, that was not to come, I sat through the credits and noticed that the final track is actually quiet an ear-catcher. To my horror, I had to realize that this was a 'Take That' song – pardon me, it's a Metalhead speaking, who's last words will be 'Black Sabbath Rules'. But yes, the song fit like the proverbial 'butt on the bucket'.So, despite knowing that the future 'X-Men Origins II – Rise of the X-Men' (or whatever they'll call it), won't live up to 'X-Men Origin: First Class', I'll probably march into the cinema, hand over my eight bucks and go watch it. Damn you, Hollywood, you've conned this sucker again! 8 out of 10",8,1,2,27 March 2012
The Wolverine," It's almost as if they weren't even trying anymore.
","First off: Spoilers? Why bother? People don't read reviews for recommendations, whether they should go see the film; they read them to confirm that the movie was as bad as they perceived it.Now, let me admit: I took the bait willingly, consciously, despite better knowledge or foreboding. Mea culpa, but why break a lifelong habit, even if it's a bad one? I paid my handful of dollars, stood in line with my fellow zombies (some which were muttering something along the lines, 'boy, this is going to be worst then the first Wolverine-movie'), filed into those mortuary-halls called cinema and, well, pretty much waited for a miracle. You know what happens to people who wait for miracles? They'll get disappointed because miracles only happen to other people who they know only through hearsay, because miracles defy all logic.But why would we expect more than the usual, well-worn out action-fare? Why expect scriptwriters to spend valuable time to compose a half-engaging script and fix the most obvious plot holes? Like I said: the suckers (like myself) come cheap and will swallow the bait nevertheless; it takes only the magic words 'Wolverine', 'Hugh Jackman' and 'Sequel'.Obviously, this was meant (or rather marketed) as a deep study of the man-slash-mutant who is indestructible and (possibly) immortal. There was more depth and insight into the Wolverine-character in those scenes, where Wolverine and Rogue drive in Wolverines pick-up-truck in the first movie. The dream-sequences with Jean Grey, as pointless and tedious as they were – there was more depth in Mystiques and Wolverines cameo-appearances in the First-Class-movies (and, forgive me the wordplay, 'more class'). A movie where Wolverine looses his powers and spends a good deal of the time bleeding, hurting and whining, isn't that what we all rooted for? Like the last Highlander-film, where the immortals loose their immortality and that Future-Superman-film, when Superman will loose his powers through an overdose of kryptonite? And as for the 'antagonist' Silver Samurai: Did we really expect that rather interesting character from the comics to make an appearance or did we fore-smell that it would be the obvious: A huge, Transformer-like robot made of Adamantium, with grandfather sitting inside? Don't get me started on the Viper-character; neither 'actress' nor character is worth the electronic ink.I could go on with a list of complaints, but feel that this has been covered by a good percentage of reviewers (and why even bother writing another review? Like I mentioned: I stick to my bad habits, which include writing reviews about the last X-Men-movie I saw). Let me just state one more observation: the haircut they gave Jackman was ridiculous and reminded me more of some old The Three Stooges clip.Plus: one reason I have rooted for this film was Hiroyuki Sanada, whom I consider one of the finest actors that Japan has produced in recent years and – given time and the right roles – might one day become something like the Asian Christopher Lee. What on earth was I dreaming, thinking or smoking, believing for one second that his role or talent might not be utterly wasted? By the end of the film, I had convinced myself that I had come to the cinema for one sole reason: the after-credit-scene. Surely, Magneto and Dr. X would have a cameo in this scene. They did. Neither of them aged very well (but then again, who does?) Maybe Magneto will fix Wolverines horribly stumpy claws in the next movie, maybe they'll put a little more effort into the next X-Men-movie and allow the Wolverine-franchise to fade away.Or maybe I'm just being naïve.4/10",4,2,4,22 December 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Chunky, self-important, conservative – the trilogy could have done without the third part
","I really wanted to like the last part of Nolans Batman trilogy; after all, together with the first 'X-Man'-movie and Watchmen', Batman Begins' and The Dark Knight' were among the few comic book adaptations that actually worked. 'Batman Begins' gave new life to a franchise that was crippled by Schumacher's 'Batman and Robin', while 'The Dark Knight' had one of the most iconic performances of recent years (and I'll give you a hint: it wasn't Bales performance).Where did the final part go wrong? Well, to begin with, it had all the weaknesses of 'The Dark Knight', without having TDKs strong points. Bane is not nearly as iconic a villain as was the Joker, and although Tom Hardy does a decent job, he's never able to out-Herod Herod. Plus, it doesn't help that his mask renders him pretty inaudible – I mean, the hero growls, the villain mumbles; come on Nolan, was it part of the concept that the audience cannot understand the main characters? Bale is going through the routine, agreeable as usually, be it as the Howard Hughes-like reclusive millionaire or, later, as more or less rejuvenated Bruce Wayne. Yet, if that is at all possible, his growling and grimacing whenever he's wearing the Batman costume (which seems even chunkier compared to the sleek suit in 'Batman Begins') is even more annoying than in the previous parts.Caine, Oldman and Freeman have little more than cameo appearances. Speaking about the supporting roles: the first two films did a good job casting actors like Rutger Hauer, Michael Jai White or Eric Roberts (to name but a few) in small but effective roles; the third installment features mainly bland, uninteresting extras. It's almost a relief to see 'veterans' like Cillian Murphy and Liam Neeson, but again, their appearances are limited to the blink of an eye.Like in the prior installments, Nolan once again presents the villains as thinly disguised terrorists rather than super powered megalomaniacs. However, other than the Jihadist-like Ras-al-Ghul or the urban terrorist Joker, the Bane character is distinctly influenced by contemporary events, namely the 'Occupy Wall Street'-movement which was briefly trendy last year and was the butt of jokes for all but followers of this movement. Not exactly a good premise for a supposedly impressive scenario.As for the finale: it's neither as grand as the hype would have demanded it, nor is it as witty as it thinks it is. That the non-canonical figure of John Blake would inherit the cowl of the Bat was as foreseeable as tomorrow's sunrise. Rather than a grand showdown between Bane and Batman, Bane is relegated to a mere henchman at the end of the film and disposed off rather unceremoniously; almost as if the Joker had slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck halfway through 'The Dark Knight'.It's not mindless, CGI-driven Popcorn cinema like the recent string of Marvel-Superhero films but its trying way too hard to disguise that in essence, the Batman films are first and primarily action flicks.'TDKR', despite its convoluted storyline, plot-holes big enough to let the bat-plane fly through and often annoying acting, is a solid action flick but wants to be more – but the wish remains the father of the thought.5/10",5,5,10,20 February 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," GREAT MOVIE! (For all the wrong reasons)
","Sure, you remember flipping through those old comic-books, where Superman breaks people's necks, drops building on young and old alike, and kills everybody in the end. Oh, you don't? Well, but you certainly remember those Bat of Gotham comics, where the Bat(man) voices his desires to kill everyone, dons a Columbine trench coat and shoots at everything that moves with a shotgun? What, no recollection of those either? Well Zack Snyder remembers those comics, though I'm not quite sure anybody but himself has read them. I'm joking, of course. Superman isn't a mass-murdering terrorist from outer space and Batman isn't a gun-toting psychopath. Only in Snyder's mind and his movie.'Dawn of the Dead' – a fresh breeze in the rotting Zombie-genre, at a time where people would have giggled at the notion of a 'The Walking Dead' TV-show. 'Watchmen' – I admit to my personal opinion, perhaps the finest comic-book-adaption to have been filmed (yet). '300' – if you are a male and have but an ounce of male-hormones in you, you probably loved that one too. Great director! Until something happened (we're not quite sure what. Perhaps a brick or a camera fell at the wrong place, at the wrong time) and he produced this shamble. Convoluted? Over-long? Ponderous? Scenes, pointlessly strung together, as if to say 'hey! Let's make a baby somehow!'? These are just words, but to understand the actual meaning, you'd have to go and see the movie yourself. That guy who is playing Lex Luthor? Well, I don't know where that came up. Perhaps the actor threw a tantrum, demanding that his character be 'more like the Joker!' and they just let him go ahead for the sake of peace. But he talks a lot. As in: 'A Lot!'. But that was fine. It gave the audience the opportunity to go visit the bathroom, perhaps shave, purchase more popcorn, have a cigarette outside and chat a little about how great the Christopher Nolan films were. Then return to the seats – and Luthor would still be talking about some things or the other! But who knows? Perhaps he makes a living out of giving Heath Ledger impersonations at parties and public events, so we shouldn't lay so much blame on the poor guy. The guy who plays Superman? Well, like they promised – 'The Man of Steel'. Not completely incorrect, and it sounds a lot cooler than 'The Man of Wood'. But that's just the acting. Everything else is like in the comic: 'It's a bird! It's a nuclear missile! It's a terrorist-god from outer space, who might have come to destroy humankind! It's', well, Christopher Reeve it isn't, but they're discussing him on CNN. And then there was a lady thrown in – maybe from the tops of mount Olympus – that was playing Wonder Woman. Lynda Carter, god bless her, wherever she may be now. And now we get to the juicy part, the Faustian question that has plagued mankind for the last three or four years: Ben Affleck. Again, I do admit – freely and unrepentant - that I am one of those 'haters': never liked the man. Liked the notion of what he perceives as acting even less. And yes, he was the best thing in this movie – now, that's how bad 'Batman versus Superman' is! Well, having said that the Affleck-Batman murders everybody was a little incorrect – sure, most of his victims probably died later in hospital, but he also guns down quite a few opponents. And I liked the trench-coat, though that notion made me feel slightly morbid. But of course 'Superman v Batman' has a lot more to offer. It's after all about 5 ½ hours long – or at least that's what it felt like (trying to avoid superlatives like 'a life-time'). As said, Lex Luthor talks a lot, plenty of close-ups of everybody involved, CGI-effects, images of Christ (in slow motion! Did I mention that this was a Zack Snyder film?), Batman stealing kryptonite, Batman and Superman fighting (I kid you not, this scene is actually in the move!), until the great revelation of all things revolving around the plot and everything else (*SPOILERS AHEAD*): Batman's mom and Superman's foster-mother share the same given name! (*MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD* It's Martha! Hallelujah!). Then they become best buddies! And some big orc or troll (*MILD SPOILER*) kills off Superman, but I do suspect that he might be back in one of the sequels or future 'Justice League'-films (like I said, it's a Zack Snyder film, so he'll wake up three days later). Then the movie ended and the audience tumbled back into the streets – some seemed dazed and confused, others sang hymns – but most assembled at the nearest McDonald's, demanding cheeseburgers and I personally felt content – today was Monday and they would air a new episode of 'The Flash' on TV! And on Wednesday they'd air an episode of 'Gotham', which, for the first time in my life filled me with the feeling of gratitude! But hey, what do I know? Apparently not much, since plenty of BvS-claqueurs and cheering Persians reminded me, that I just 'didn't understand this movie'. So, since words fail me, I'll resort to have numbers do the talking: 3/10",3,4,9,2 April 2016
Rock Star," Boogie Nights' for Metalheads (despite 'Boogie Nights' being a way better movie)
","When singer Rob Halford announced that he would leave his band, Judas Priest', many a Heavy Metal fan felt that the end of the world was nigh. After all, 'Judas Priest' was one of the most influential Metal bands, having determined what Metal looks and sounds likes, even today. Halford claimed, after twenty years, the music (for him) had stagnated, that he wanted to find a new sound and that he was sick and tired of having to hide his homosexuality (which surprised very few fans, for whom Halfords sexual orientation has always been an unspoken secret). 'Judas Priest' hired young, aspiring Tim 'Ripper' Owens, an impressive singer in his own rights and lifelong 'Priest'-fan.When 'Rock Star' arrived at the cinema, many 'Judas Priest' fans where ecstatic: the movie was rumored to have been based on Tim Owens short-lived career as 'Priest'-singer.Essentially the movie is about every music-lovers dream come true: what would happen if you'd become the singer of your favorite Rock band? Unfortunately, to the clear of mind and reason, the answer would be painfully obvious, even blatant: euphoria and disillusion would go hand in hand, many drug-fueled parties would be followed by many painful hangovers, tour-life would take it's toll on personal relationships, and in the end one question would raise it's ugly head: is it all worth it? The film 'Rock Star' is as blatant, streamlined and obvious as reality.As to the acting: Mark Wahlberg does a convincing job, despite actually having a Pop / Hip Hop background; Jennifer Aniston plays her role as boring and mediocre as we'd expect from her and Dominic Wests limited range stands in stark contrast to Wahlbergs performance.It doesn't help much that part of 'Steel Dragon' consists of real musicians (ex-Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde, Jeff Pilson and Jason Bonham, the son of legendary 'Led Zeppelin'-drummer Jon Bonham). Most musicians (and their fans) come across as the most stereotypical Metalheads since 'Spinal Tap'.Speaking of Metalheads: the Heavy Metal scene is extremely complex, with many sub-categories, ranging from Melodic Metal over NWoBHM, Crossover to Thrash-, Black- and Death Metal, etc. The average Metalhead would identify 'Steel Dragon' as an arch-typical US-Hair-Metal band, sound and appearance owing more to bands like 'Ratt' or 'Motley Crue', rather than a 'True Metal'-band like 'Judas Priest'. Even the name 'Blood Pollution' would be something adopted by a Death Metal or Grindcore band; but rather unlikely for a band depicted in the film. A little more research would have obviously benefited the picture.Even though it's an enjoyable hour and a half but offers little-to-no fresh revelations or insights into scene, industry or even the musicians themselves. The film will essentially disappoint the average European Metal-fan – especially the fans of 'Judas Priest'. Hence, a mediocre 5 points from 10.",5,0,0,1 February 2013
