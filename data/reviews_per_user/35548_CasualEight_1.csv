Iron Man 3," Rubbish
","Sigh, when Marvel first announced that director Shane Black would helm the next Iron Man film, I was genuinely excited. As a huge fan of his previous works; Lethal Weapon, The Long Kiss Goodnight and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (which also stared Robert Downey Jr) I figured how could this fail. I was wrong. Not only did this film fail but they some how made a film about Iron Man boring and mundane. As the first phase 2 film in Marvels line up, Iron Man 3 immediately stumbles out the gate. The film is riddled with plot holes, bad writing, and flat humor. The characters are one dimensional, the villains are dull, and there was no sense of threat or urgency.This is an IRON MAN movie!, there are years worth of interesting stories and scenarios that could of been utilized to tell an engaging story. Instead we are given a poorly executed version of the Extremis storyline. There is a twist towards the 2nd act that your either gonna love or hate. Personally, I consider the plot twist a wasted opportunity. Rent this movie if you need to see it, trust me.",3,1,3,2 March 2014
