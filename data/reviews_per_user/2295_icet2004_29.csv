Kill Bill: Vol. 2," good movie
","The Bride woke up after a long coma. The baby that she carried before the coma was gone. The only thing on her mind was to get revenge on the assassination team that betrayed her - a team she was once part of. With two of the people on her Death List taken care of, she must pursue Budd, Elle Driver and of course Bill himself. Uma Thurman is very nice actress to me i really like her.Tarantino is great director in nowadays.Volume 2 opens with 'The Massacre at Two Pines,' taking place a few minutes before the events that open the first volume.but still very much violence.very stylish movie. i was a little bit disgusting when the bride hit a eye off from her enemy.",7,1,4,10 October 2007
Citizen Kane," The Greatest American Movie Ever Created
","Citizen Kane is one of the greatest movies ever created on planet earth and it's the greatest American movie ever produced. Charles Foster Kane had everything power,beautiful wife and girlfriend.Kane is also the biggest mystery film from 1940s. Orson Welles remains as one of the greatest directors and actors of all time.the film started about Charles Foster Kane death and his final words 'rosebud'.the main character Kane was inspired by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. i personally like it better than Godfather sorry godfather fans but it's overrated.Kane is ego,but he is main character. i recommend it.",7,4,6,11 September 2007

Rules of Engagement," Average
","Samuel L Jackson is pretty good actor.this movie was propaganda movie of course and distasteful propaganda,but this movie wasn't bad.i saw it in Estonian cinema 'Sõprus'.'Rules Of Engagement' is a powerful movie i think.i don't remember all the things what happened in the movie but i remember brutal spots where some children's were injured.Actually propaganda movies are not the worst movies.they can be good movies. Tommy Lee Jones played normally too i think and all actors were good there.i'm not big fan of propaganda movies,but i like some parts of 'Rules Of Engagement'.this movie was very conflicting in the year of 2000.i still liked it.i mean some spots and parts not all,because propaganda is not useful always i think.",5,0,1,12 March 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," maybe a little bit overrated but still very nice
","Uma Karuna Thurman is hardly sexy woman.She is 6 feet tall(1.83) and her appearance is very cute and of course she is sandy blond.love her.but the movie was good too some scenes was lame for sure,but effects was good.Uma Thurman role was brilliant because she is good actress.Lucy Liu she is too good actress.but these ninjas was damn lame just pointless it was the worst part of the movie.

From Dusk Till Dawn," a very good movie
","Seth Gecko and his younger brother Richard are on the lam after a bloody bank robbery in Texas. They escape across the border into Mexico and will be home-free the next morning, when they pay off the local kingpin. They just have to survive 'from dusk till dawn' at the rendezvous point, which turns out to be a Hell of a strip joint. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino(who is also one of my favorite directors was very good in this movie)Salma Hayek was very sexy there. The film begins in a liquor store where Seth and Richie hold two girls hostage while attempting to get Pete Bottoms, the clerk, to get rid of Texas Ranger Earl McGraw, who has entered the store. Just as McGraw is about to leave, he is shot in the head by Richie, thinking that Pete has mouthed 'help us.'.a lot of action good acting and funny scenes.",9,1,3,27 October 2007
A Clockwork Orange," One of my favorite movies
","this movie is awfully good.Stanley Kubrick was one the greatest directors who ever lived on planet earth.it's based on same name novel by Anthony Burgess.the main person(Malcolm McDowell)as the charismatic and psychopathic delinquent Alex.director Stanley Kubrick was a perfectionist.he has made many masterpieces.this was in many countries when it's came out.but it's still a kinky movie but anyway a masterpiece.it's a little bit future movie 1995 about imagined from 1965.a teenage boy Alex whose hobbies are violence,raping and classical music - mostly Beethoven(in book Bach) and a weird slang.most famous song in this film where Alex beating and reaping and sing song 'i'm singing in the rain'.this movie is timeless.Stanley we miss you.",9,2,5,11 September 2007
Rocky," All time classic
","Rocky(1976)is more than a movie,it's about humanity.a word humanity means actually very much.I'm sure that Rocky is better than a lot of movies in the top 250.This movie must be recommend in school. Rocky is voted in four place in Rocky 1976 is ranked #4 on the American Film Institute's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time,(first one is It's a Wonderful Life 1946).Sly AKA Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone is one of my favorite actors of all time.But in 90s Stallone got a very bad reputation in action movies where he played.he's scale was down in 90s.But Rocky and Rambo are classic movies and both should be in the 250.I like the egg scene it's fast and clear.The end in the rocky is a beautiful.Watch and enjoy.",8,0,0,14 June 2007
Some Like It Hot," Stands the name of comedy films
","this is maybe a little bit weird now,but it's one of most funnest movies ever created.Marilyn Monroe,Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. and director was billy wilder.Two Struggling musicians witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and try to find a way out of the city before they are found and killed by the mob. The only job that will pay their way is an all girl band so the two dress up as women. In addition to hiding, each has his own problems; One falls for another band member but can't tell her his gender, and the other has a rich suitor who will not take 'No,' for an answer.i recommend this movie to it.and yes Monroe was hot there.8/10.",8,2,3,9 December 2007
Titanic," One Of The Worst Movies What Ever Produced

Rocky III," Not so good than the first one but still below average
","Having defeated boxer Apollo Creed, Rocky now finds himself in an excellent position to take it easy for a while. He develops a great friendship with Creed and spends more time with his wife.I recommend it this movie is good.not timeless like Rocky I,but really Stallone all the way(not 90s crap action movies)and of course Mr.T too. he is too good actor.training scenes was good in Rocky III like in every rocky.(of course Rocky V was crap and i haven't seen Rocky IV)in this movie Rocky Balboa enjoys the wealth he has as world champion and then came Clubber Lang and won the title and nobody believes in rocky anymore,but in the Rocky shows what he is. 6.5/10",7,0,1,21 June 2007
Downfall," One of the greatest movies ever!
","i really like this movie about Hitler's last days.it's amazing realism.Bruno Ganz is great actor.amazing role and amazing chemistry. Bruno Ganz even studied Parkinson's patients in a Swiss hospital to prepare for his role as Hitler.it's great role no doubt.it's a little bit shocking too i guess.kids poisoning scene was pretty shocking i guess.and this movie makes you live the horrors of war. The last days at the bunker i guess that those hours were pretty horrible there.and it's good movie experience too.one of the most powerful i have seen.i recommend it.watch and feel the horror of the world war II.it's without a doubt a brutal movie,but anyway 9/10",9,2,4,26 August 2007

Monty Python and the Holy Grail," a weird of sense of humor
","this movie is weird.Monty Python and the holy grail(1975)is the strangest film i have ever seen in all my life.it's story about King Artur and his knights who wants to find the holy grail very much. searching holy grail has animation in between and it's horrible. know i understand why french don't like them humor i personally don't like it too.it's maybe king of comedies,but it's not my cup of tea.i liked the scenes with cows and bridge of death scene. but the end of was the worst end of movie could ever had.English humor has always been weird.just awful end of movie.it's a crazy movie like the whole Monty Python together it's a weird director. the killer rabbit scene was of course a funny.but i don't personally recommend it especially not to french.the most clueless humor the world has ever seen.",7,2,8,5 August 2007
Sin City," Super my hat goes off to Sin City

Sin City is future of the movies.violence is art there.and this movie is better than i expected and violence is definitely art. it's my opinion this movie was very dark.very expensive movie. Elijah Wood's role was terrible.he is horrible actor,but movie was good.he know same about acting like a cow about food processor. a must see film definitely i recommend it it's the future of movie-making.now i am search of frank millers book sin city.DVD of sin city is definitely big hit when it's coming out.",9,1,2,5 June 2005

The Birds," One Of The Best 50 Movies Ever
","Alfred Hitchcock was autistic guy like we all know,but in other way he was a stunning genius and Birds is one his best movies ever maybe the best.it should be definitely deserve the place in the top 250.I saw it along time ago so i don't remember all acting work,but i think that it was good,but directing was great. 'Melanie is attacked by a gull, but this is just the start of a series of attacks by an increasing number of birds'.I personally think that when nature get mad(birds and animals)then it's a big big trouble and it's impossible.we don't know when it's happen.Hitchcock is without a doubt one of the greatest directors of all times,like Kurosawa,Kubrick,Fellini,Bergman,Tarantino,Eastwood,Welles and Fleming.In nowadays there is a very directors who is close to Hitchcock.Rest In Peace Hitch",10,3,6,4 July 2007
