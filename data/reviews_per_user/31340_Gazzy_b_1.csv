The Blair Witch Project," Camping Will Never be the Same
","To all the movie-goers who have not seen this film- the critics who have panned the film are jumping to conclusions. The film itself, will watching it, is not horribly terrifying-as advertising had shown- however, the fear creeps in when you the viewer are faced with now venturing out into the night. After seeing it, I ran through my backyard after hearing a noise while walking home. Going to sleep that night was not an easy thing to do and neither will be my camping trip planed for next week.The real fear is made up in the mind of the viewer and their surroundings. So to all viewers who plan to see this film. It's worth seeing. To all critics who have disliked it-you must not have very creative imaginations.",10,1,2,10 August 1999
