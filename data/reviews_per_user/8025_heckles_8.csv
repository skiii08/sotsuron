The Blair Witch Project," I thought Heather was good!
","Heather Donahue gets a ton of flack in this site and a Razzle nomination for supposedly being a bad actress.  Yes, her character is overly exuberant, pushy, and perhaps a little conscious that she is one female alone with two rather hapless males.   In short, her character is dislikable.   Her character, however, is not the actress.  Get the difference folks?    While I've never known anyone exactly like the Heather character, I could easily put her together from two or three women I've known personally (and without the least diminution in the number of 'f__' words used).  Which says to me, her performance worked.",Null,0,1,28 October 2001
Passengers," I LOVED the first quarter of the movie
","I loved this movie up until the point that the Jennifer Lawrence character was awakened - which is a bit unexpected, as I usually find Lawrence attractive and talented. But as long as Chris Pratt was by himself, I found an hilarious comic sci-fi scenario - where he's trapped in an environment which couldn't be happening, because the software designers didn't anticipate it, and they know everything, right? I see myself dealing with this all the time.",6,1,2,13 July 2018
The Exorcist," Although a nonbeliever, I love this film
","Demonic possession is, for me, a lot of hooey. So why did I enjoy re-seeing this film so much?For one thing, the movie doesn't scrimp on showing the search to find a conventional explanation on why Regan is going from sweet to difficult to psychotic and beyond. In this it puts the viewer into the head of bewildered Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn), who like myself is irreligious. One might even say this dates the film, being that audiences don't have so much patience for lengthy revelation before the shock scenes.But more so, I like this film because of Jason Miller's Father Damien Karras, easily my favorite movie priest. He doubts, he is burdened with palatable guilt for the lonely death of his mother, he's reluctant to help Chris...but when it's just down to him against Old Scratch, he knows the right thing to do and does it. I am amused by the irony in the caution given to Karras by Fr. Merrin: 'The Devil will mix lies with the truth to confuse us.' So the Devil, it turns out, is a lot like a politician. Is this why he is showing up in Washington?",Null,1,2,30 October 2000
Independence Day," Chavinistic junk
","Absolutely agreed with ANVAAS   The movie reeked with assy American chauvinism, the worst insult being that according to the film,  the rest of the world can't wait to adopt our national holiday.   Get a clue my fellow Americans--the rest of the world is not sitting around waiting to become just like us.Equally annoying is the much-ballybooed prayer scene, the one Bob Dole liked so much. Think folks. It's easy to imagine we're God's special creation when we share the known universe with animals the smartest of which can't assemble a three-piece jigsaw puzzle. But here come aliens who can assemble a spaceship as big as Brazil and fly it across the galaxy...wouldn't there be a theological question in a more intelligent film, like maybe we're like their beef cattle, and God created us for them?",Null,3,5,5 October 1998
A Bug's Life," The most Marxist film I've seen in a long time
","I mean, how could Hopper and his gang be a more obvious illustration of the ruling class under capitalism, as described by the writing of Marx and Engels?  After all, they do no work but live off the labor of the working class, represented by - of course! - ants.  Is not the scene were Hopper turns in fury on one of his cronies - 'we must never let them know how strong they are' - depictive of the fear those upper classes have that the prolateriat will come to recognize its power?   And is not the 'circus clique' just a stand-in for the intelligentia, whose purpose is to educate the working class how to rise up against its oppressors?      
   --Okay, folks. I'm having a little fun here.   Still, I doubt that this film could have been made in the early fifties, when the favorable depiction of any king of collective action was considered subversive.",Null,0,0,5 August 2000
The Godfather: Part III," The Last Scene
","Many people have been critical of the last scene, more than one comment comparing it to Arte Johnson's routine on 'Laugh In'.   I for one appreciated it--the point was, that Michael pretty much died when his beloved daughter was killed, and his actual expiration was a mere technicality.This movie had its pluses--a very strong performance by Pacino,  Andy Garcia's fiery Vincent, the changing of Connie from a hapless shrew to an Empress Livia-type killer, and some good cinematography.    And it has its minuses--an irrelevant subplot concerning the Vatican,  the annoying George Hamilton, and of course the miscasting of Coppola's daughter in the small but key role of Mary.  (Note:  was I the only one who noticed that Sofia Coppola does not look even remotely like Diane Keaton, her presumptive mother?)To end on a positive note,  I would still like to see a Godfather IV, if only  to watch  a power struggle between Vincent and Connie.  Just leave out George Hamilton.",Null,0,2,16 March 1999
Enemy at the Gates," Where the hell was everybody?
","Reading these reviews, everyone seemed to get riled at the love scene. Along with the sets - which were superlative, by the way, I found the love scene to be the least problematical.   To those who had problems with said scene: the human sex drive does not switch off due to the proximity of war or the non-proximity of a bathtub.   I've heard of plenty of people  in wartime catching as catch can in the manner of Weisz and Law.    But what bothered me was the way everyone with the exception of the principals seemed to disappear at times from the face of Stalingrad! Stalingrad was a massive battle involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers within an urban area.   Every yard of open space at the front was guarded by numerous rifles and machine guns from both sides, not to mention artillery, mines and booby traps.      There is no way on earth anyone could have moved from side to side in the manner of Sasha, no way anyone would dare expose themselves -ever - in daylight without considerable covering fire.",Null,0,0,19 March 2001
Gangs of New York," My 'Oh, Come On!' Moment
","(Major spoilers ahoy.)  This movie had a prime example of one of my Movie Conventions I hate. It's called the Shockingly Bad Things Can't Happen to Big Stars.  You might remember one time this was broken in 'The Cowboys,' when Bruce Dern became the only 'name' actor to shoot down John Wayne - from behind. Dern got death threats for his impertinence.  Well, we don't see it in this movie - but we ought to.  Amsterdam (Leonardo diCaprio) attempts to shoot Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) during a gathering.   Bill just found out that his almost-adopted son is really the son of his most formidable opponent, 'Priest' Vallon, who he killed over a decade before.   It doesn't take a genius to know that Amsterdam will just keep coming after the Butcher if he gets the chance, and the Butcher is no fool.   Keep in mind, too, Bill became king of the Five Points area by being a ruthless sadist, imposing visceral fear on all those around him - who are just as vicious as he is, if a lot less stylish.  Bill has Amsterdam thrown down on a table.  Does he kill him?  Does he mutilate him severely, at least make him useless to Cameron Diaz, if you know what I mean?  Nah!   He can't do that!  This is Leonardo diCaprio!  So he burns him on the cheek with the tip of his knife and lets him go.  Soon the burn looks like a cute little sunburn scar.  And then the final climatic duel.  If you could put diCaprio and Day-Lewis completely in character, and have them fight it out and script be damned, who would you bet on?   Well, my money would be solidly on Day-Lewis/Bill. He showed so much more potency than diCapiro/Amsterdam.  But we know characters' displayed ability doesn't win contests in movies - box office appeal does, and that's why the duel turns out the way it does.
  By the way, I did like the costumes and the sets, so I'm not calling it a complete loss.",Null,0,0,25 December 2002
