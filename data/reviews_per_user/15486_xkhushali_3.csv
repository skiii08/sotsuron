Source Code," Worth seeing.
","Right from the start, the intense music and mind racing scene catches your attention...and also leaves you squirming with questions (e.g. 'What just happened?!'). This movie is about a guy named Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is on a mission to find the bomber of a train that exploded killing everyone on board. The twist? Well, it's complicated. Stevens has to constantly 'go back' in eight minute intervals to the event to find out who the mysterious bomber is. He 'goes back' through a program called Source Code which is a program that lets a selected being so-to-speak 'relive' an event but not change the outcome or anything of the sort because Source Code acts similar to a parallel world. The movie follows Stevens' journey through the use of this innovative program that could perhaps save a future, bigger scale, bombing from happening. The only con I have in the storyline is the end. I felt it was too 'Hollywood'. It felt as if it went on a little longer than it should have.Acting-wise, Jake Gyllenhaal is not to be underestimated; he has come a long way from 'Donnie Darko'. Vera Farmiga (who played Goodwin, the lady running Source Code), was a star like always. Jeffrey Wright, who played the mastermind behind Sorce Code had a nice performance as a particularly mysterious guy. Michelle Monaghan was the love-interest of the movie, her parts were simple yet sweet. Russell Peters even had a small part in the movie. In my opinion, his acting was decent, but I would have liked to see him play himself (though his character is similar). Overall, in three words, this movie was: innovative (the concept was something fresh that I hadn't seen in a movie recently), suspenseful (you'll be guessing throughout the movie who the bomber is), and (incredibly) mind-blowing. This is one of the best new movies out this year and defiantly one of the best thrillers out recently.",8,1,2,19 November 2011
Se7en," Excellent movie, Must see.
","This movie is what I call a solid, A+, suspense/crime movie. It was innovative and very well-written. The cinematography in the movie was chilling with most scenes being dark or rainy thus adding to the effect. There is only one focus on this movie and that is Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) and Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman)'s journey to find a psychopath killer (Kevin Spacey) who uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his guide. We see each murder as a crime scene as opposed to the murders happening; this I thought, added to the suspense of finding out who this killer is. The crimes lead up to probably one of the biggest twists in cinema history. It will have you guessing, what will happen? Everything will go through your head, and you will probably be wrong.This movie, just like Fight Club, proved that Brad Pitt is not just a pretty face. His acting skills alongside Morgan Freeman are salute-able. Freeman is great in just about any movie just as this one. And Kevin Spacey...his work was phenomenal. His character is probably one of the most remarkable ones ever; and he aced at bringing him to life. Gwyneth Paltrow was also in the movie as David Mill's wife. Her parts weren't too big, but she still did well.I highly suggest watching this movie if you like a good mystery/scary movie. It will defiantly stick to your head after watching. Movies rarely ever scare me, but this one came really close.",9,0,1,19 November 2011
127 Hours," Inspiring, strong movie.
","As I was watching this movie for the first time, I instantly knew it would find itself on my favorite movies list. '127 Hours' is a movie about a man named Aron Ralston, an everyday guy with a passion for mountain climbing and anything outdoors, who winds up stuck on the line between life and death- or rather, between freedom and a boulder. He is pinned by his arm against a canyon wall and has to take a stab at surviving. It is based on a true story.I have a lot of respect for Danny Boyle. I have always loved his style of directing, so I was keen to see what his next project would be after 'Slumdog Millionaire' swept the Oscars in 2008. I had heard this story many times before, so I was instantly interested in how Boyle would turn this tragic story into a big screen movie. He did not disappoint. One of my favorite things about the movie is that Danny Boyle stayed really close to the actual story. The real Aron Ralston said so himself that the movie is as accurate as you can get while still being a drama.Boyle made the right choice in bringing back A. R. Rahman to score the movie. The music is what completed the movie, in more ways than it would affect other movies because of the situation. There are scenes that portray just plain emotion, and the music adds a whole new level of depth to these scenes. The soundtrack is chilling, yet so beautiful.Casting-wise, James Franco was perfectly cast as Aron Ralston. I was a fan before, but this movie doubled my respect for him. His performance was astonishing and completely believable.Before I watched this movie, questions were floating in my head. Will this whole movie take place in the canyon? Will it be boring? Will it be sickening? No, no, and yes. About 70-75% of the movie does take place inside the canyon, but it does not get boring. Flashbacks and hallucinations fill up some time here, but during this portion of the movie (in the canyon), you feel as if you are in there yourself or that Aron is talking to you personally. The movie is very intimate. That even applies to the squeamish moments. There IS a lot of blood. Do not be surprised if you find yourself looking away from the screen at some parts (I could not help it).While watching this movie, I felt anticipation. I felt fear. I felt. optimism. I laughed. I cried. This movie truly is the whole package. I highly recommend everyone to see this movie at some point in their life. It is eye-opening and will make you wonder...what would you do if you were in Aron's shoes?",10,0,1,19 November 2011
