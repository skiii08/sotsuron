It," Better Than Expected.
","I thought this film would be overrated according to the reviews. I went to watch it yesterday and I was pleasantly surprised. Their are great young actors as the kids, the clown in scary and it has a great creepy atmosphere going on. This movie will likely stick with you for some time. Maybe not as amazing as other reviews have said, I don't know how it compares to the original(I have not seen it),but this film is definitely worth a watch. Overall 7.5/10.",7,3,5,21 September 2017
Captain Marvel," Brilliant
","I just watched this yesterday and I'm very surprised with the negative reviews. I thought the movie supported a great cast and the story moves along swiftly. It is also just under 2 hours long, which is nothing compared to other marvel movies. I highly recommend this movie to any marvel fan, don't worry about the negative reviews, you will enjoy it!!",9,2,5,11 March 2019
Justice League," Justice is found.
","I had very high expectations for this movie, because it features the whole team(except Green Lantern),this movie has a very simple story line. The action sequences are generally good, but there is too much CGI.There are 2 post credit scenes which link to the next Justice League movie, as a whole it sets up all individual movies, for the rest of the members. Overall not fantastic, but worth a watch.7/10.",7,0,4,1 December 2017
Straight Outta Compton," Awesome
","Being a huge NWA fan since year 10 in high school,now (29)this movie was a dream come true,about my favourite hip hop act of all time. The cast did a great job especially the actors playing the 3 main leads(DR.DRE,ICE CUBE,EAZY-E). The movie paces itself brilliantly and everyone is given ample screen time.",10,4,18,5 July 2017
