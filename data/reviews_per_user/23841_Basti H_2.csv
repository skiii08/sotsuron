Ghost," Wonderful, except...
","Well, I actually liked that movie. Wonderful tearjerker in one moment, brillant comedy (especially by Whoopi Goldberg) in the next. Good actors, interesting story and so on - I don't need to recommend that further as a lot of people did it before me.But there's one thing, well, I didn't like at all, and that the others didn't mention: Well, of course, the characterization of heaven and hell and especially the hell's scum where quite clich√©d and Hollywood typical,too pathetic the heaven, ridiculous hell... but it's a movie,that wasn't exactly the point I disliked, but: Why do the bad guys have to die? I mean - is it really a good solution to revenge murder with murder? Do they necessarily have to be KILLED, just, that it happens to them what they did to Sam? Well, he's dead and wishes them (from the beginning!) dead, too! And just because he's dead, well, does that set the movie apart from other 'self justice' movies? That's what the makers must have thought. But self justice is never a solution. Sometimes it's understandable (still not right),there are some movies who handle that difficult topic quite well. But it definitely shouldn't be propagated completely uncritical by a movie - and that's what this one does!!! It's a pity, because the rest, as I said before, is a good, if not very good, movie!",Null,1,2,19 October 2002
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Dumb,stupid...far away from being 'excellent'
","I watched this movie on TV - and I waited 'till the end for something funny to happen.I thought:This cannot be that bad at all...but it was! It isn't funny at all! The idea was good,but the realization was really as dumb as the so-called heros of this so-called excellent adventure are. The gags are just childish and infantile - at the most,children under the age of ten could laugh about it. The language that Bill & Ted use got so on my nerves I often thought of destroying my TV... unbelievable that this Z-movie was a success!!!",Null,4,10,15 July 2001
