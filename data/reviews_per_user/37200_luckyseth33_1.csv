Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Vintage Tarantino - What is your favourite breakfast cereal?
","Mr. Tarantino stakes his claim to the title of master filmmaker with Kill Bill Volumes I and II. Volume 2 completes the masterpiece by taking the art of storytelling to a whole new level. My favourite element of these films is the subtle use of breakfast cereals throughout the film. Whether I imagined its intention or not I do believe it characterizes the respect Tarantino brings to his profession. Details: dialog, music, colour, cereal... Haven't seen both movies yet? I suggest you stop reading at this point.Kaboom is the name of the breakfast cereal which Vernita Green hides her gun in an attempt to blow away the bride.Oren: Silly Rabbit Bride: Trix are for KidsWe learn the brides name: Beatrix Kiddo (be a TRIX kid?)And at the end of the film, a final pan shows a box of lucky charms on the table.Don't see Kill Bill once. See it twice. 5 out of 5 cocoa puffs.",10,1,2,16 April 2004
