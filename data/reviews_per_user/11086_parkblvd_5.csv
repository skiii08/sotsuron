The Ring," this movie scared the hell out of me
","I've never been scared by horror movies.  I thought the Shining, though well done, was boring.  Suspenseful, yes, but never scary.  So I'm not the biggest fan of horror.  After having watched the Ring, I must say it's the greatest horror film I've ever seen (guess I should go watch more =)  ). I was genuinely frightened throughout the entire length of the film.  I will go see this film again at least twice, and I suggest you do, too.  The ending is also incredible - for a second I thought this movie ripped off a film done a few years ago (not the Sixth Sense), but then it twisted its way into a thrilling conclusion.",9,0,0,20 October 2002
Underworld," shows exactly how bad the Matrix might have been...
","Oh my god - I'm not sure how to express how badly this movie was done.  I am NOT the kind of guy to trash a movie, but this was one of the worst films I've ever seen.  Underworld shows us exactly how bad the Matrix might have been.  There isn't a single compelling person, event, or idea in this movie. Not one.  It's almost baffling - it's marketed toward the gothy set, but contains no dark dialogue at all.  The firefights are listless - they're almost like filler between... nothing.  The acting is beyond awful - Carrot Top could have done a better job than almost anyone who appeared in this wreck.  God - I hate it when I agree with critics, but this movie just SUCKED.It was almost as if someone had dared the writers/director to create a movie entirely based on previous films, BUT without using a single compelling actor, or topic, or anything.  It wasn't even entertainment - I LOVE mindless garbage movies, but the effects in this movie were minimal at best and boring at worst.  I YAWNED THREE TIMES DURING THE FILM.  I wasn't tired. It was that bad.I rated it a 5, since of course there were a few special effects, including the UV bullets that kill vampires.  They used this effect ONCE.  I swear to god - they showed this effect 3 minutes into the movie, and then forgot about it.  I saw several people in the theater giving the screen the finger after the movie had ended.  That's pretty much how it left you feeling.Do not see this film.  It will fail any minimal expectation that you set for it.  It's the first time ever that I've wanted a refund after a movie. Well, second - I was forced to see Star Trek V once...",5,0,0,26 September 2003
Shaun of the Dead," *the* most inconsistent movie ever made
","OK - first off, American here, though I LOVE British humor.Shaun of the Dead has to be THE most inconsistent move I've ever seen. Its low points were so low, and so bad, that I actually mulled getting up and walking out of the theater, something I've never done, or even felt during a movie before. Its high points, however, were so funny, that they rank among the top ten of the funniest scenes/lines I've EVER seen in a movie.HUH?!Without giving anything away, I can say that Shaun of the Dead starts slowly. PAINFULLY slowly, as if nobody would notice if they didn't really have an intro. The filler scenes which depict the theme of the movie were WAY too forced, as if the director and writer were making the movie for cretins. And then - the zombies start coming out, and there are some of the best scenes I've ever seen (in terms of humor, NOT horror) in a movie.Then... it died. And died horribly. The movie, throughout its length, is part real zombie film, part spoof, part comedy, part British-situational/occupational-comedy, and the problem is that the parts not only didn't mesh, but as single units, they were awful. There were attempted jokes, most of them incredibly poor, and attempted British situational humor, the type of which nobody outside Britain would find funny. (and I LOVE British humor!)And then... it resurrected itself! The ending was brilliant. Again, some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a film. Just... stunning.Shaun of the Dead is two movies, one with a rating of 5, and one with a rating of 10, violently fused together. It should not be missed, nor should it be watched, as a whole.",7,0,2,27 September 2004
Hellboy," A Tale of the Arbitrary Struggle Between Hellboy and Rasputin!
","First, I didn't get the same subliminal messages they're showing in all the other theaters, so I wasn't hypnotized into liking it like most other people were.  So this is a review *without* those messages.The conclusion first - this movie's in the same class as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.The beginning of the movie was painful - a B-movie that wasn't quite bad enough to laugh at.  But grossly overdone.  You could feel the cost of your ticket being put into the special effects, which the director used because nothing else in the scene was working.After the opening, an awkward introduction of all of the characters was made.  The dialogue reeked of exposition.   Which means it wasn't natural - it was all about explaining the backstory.  (But not all of it.  Only some parts of it!)The real problem with this movie, ripped right off the comic book pages, was that it was all too arbitrary.  The world was dull, and it seemed like the writer kept throwing things in - oooh, there's a three headed frog!  Now it's snowing!  Look - Hellboy needs glasses!  And eats shampoo!  (I'm making all of these up, but the movie was really THAT arbitrary.)  You never, ever once started to care about anyone (the villains, the heroes, the danger), and it wasn't *fun*.  Movies like this need to be fun, and Hellboy wasn't.The director, del Toro, is VERY good at having goal-oriented, single-minded characters. Blade II (his movie) was schlock, but it was entertaining schlock.  Hellboy was a literal adaptation of the comic book, and it needed a director who knows how to set the mood.  del Toro has no idea how to set mood.So, in short, Hellboy's in the same class as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  I brought my friends, and now they won't ever again trust me to recommend a movie.  Don't make your friends hate you.  Skip Hellboy.",5,1,4,19 April 2004
The Departed," well...
","The ending of this movie was so neat, Marky Mark was wearing booties....Honestly. Amazing potential, a golden cast, incredible acting, a perfectly executed story, each scene so crafted, and then the ending wrapped it all up in such a contrived way. You could actually predict the last five minutes.I am all about movies ending - no loose ends - but this ending was so planned... It just ruined the movie for me. The movie is an 8, but with a different finish, it would easily have been a 9.5. There is no bad acting in this movie at all. The overall culture is represented almost flawlessly, and each person plays a necessary role (save perhaps Alec Baldwin, but I like him a lot, so it was all good).Martin Scorsese also seems to be stuck in a little bit of a genre rut. I can't blame him - he does movies like these very well - but you almost wish he would strike out and do something a bit less mob-oriented.",8,1,2,10 October 2006
