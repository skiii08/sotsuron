The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," If We Burn, You Burn
","'This is the start of how it all ends. They used to shout my name, now they whisper it. I'm speeding up and this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart.' The war has begun, the rebellion has started, the fire is ignited, the Mockingjay lives. Katniss Everdeen, the girl from District 12 survives the arena, unbeknowest to the Capitol and President Snow. Now she must fight and fight she must. But all is still not right. She now has to rescue the one she loves and he is being held captive and tortured by Snow and used as a weapon to get the rebels to cease fire and relinquish their rights as rightful citizens of Panem, according to President Snow. This movie defied all odds. Since 2012, our eyes were opened to the girl from District 12, and then she caught fire and now she is the rebel leader who will bring down the Capitol and their wicked ways. I was one of the select few who saw this movie as part of a marathon leading up to this movie. I was stunned and floored. Nothing will ever compare to this movie. The song that leads this movie is a perfect match to spark that yellow flicker beat. The cast and the crew – you were heartbreakingly incredible – Jennifer Lawrence, you stun us every time you grace the screen; Josh Hutcherson, you gave the best performance to date – Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Julianne Moore – you are my favorite, but the prize would have to go to the game-maker on this one, Phillip Seymour Hoffman – you are the definition of the cinema, you have given your best performances from Capote to The Talented Mr. Ripley to Doubt to Catching through Mockingjay, Part 2 – this is one is for you. Thank you Suzanne Collins for allowing us to dive in to your world of this Utopian universe. You have given us something to believe in and this ourselves and to spark that flame in our hearts. Now, what will happen to Peeta? What will Katniss do? Will President Snow live or be executed for his crimes? All these and questions and more will be answered in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 on November 20, 2015.",10,4,8,10 February 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A Return to the High Seas
","Eight years ago we were introduced to a scallywag, a pirate of sorts, a pirate by trade – Captain Jack Sparrow. Who would have thought that a big-time attraction from Disneyland & Disney World could spark a dynamite in the hearts of moviegoers? Gore Verbinski took that risk and the torch was passed down to a man who directed musicals and what not – Rob Marshall. Well, I say, way to go Rob. You have done the crew a very BIG debt of gratitude. You took the reins and you shook them hard to make this movie the best of the 4. The cast – Geoffrey Rush, Ian McShane (thank you for portraying Blackbeard the way it was supposed to be played), the beautiful and talented Penelope Cruz and most importantly the man who needs no introduction the man who played Edward Scissorhands, the man who played Willy Wonka, the 21 Jump Street actor from all those years ago to a rising star and a beloved actor – the incredible Johnny Depp. From the story line, to the special effects, to the great music (Hans Zimmer, again you have proved your worth.) I give this movie a resounding and magnifying ARRRRRGGGGhH (a 10).",10,1,2,25 June 2014
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," 4 years spanning
","On November 21, 2008, we were introduced to a whole new world of the supernatural – vampires and the occasional love between a vampire and a mortal. Then the real battle began on November 20, 2009, when the were-wolves came out of the bag, literally and the ever-so-much killing spree of a notorious vampire who was determined to kill the mortal for beheading her mate. Then on June 30, 2010, that same vampire – Victoria, created an army to wipe the Cullen clan off the face of the earth and the supernatural world, but in the end death would meet her in the afterlife as she herself becomes ash and dust. Now we come to November 18, 2011, where the epic battle between what is right and what will be will come to an epic end in Part 1 of the 2-part phenomenal and mesmerizing conclusion to the story of a love that will last into eternity.It all started with a longing, and it will end in happiness. To the creator – Stephanie Meyer, thank you so much for an incredible journey of love, passion and heart – you have given us something that we can cherish for the rest of our lives.",10,1,8,25 June 2014
Iron Man 3," An Adventurous Continuation(retracted)
","In 2008, we were re-introduced to a comic book that we grew up as kids reading – Iron Man. But this time, an epic adventure that gave us a lesson in identity. An identity of sorts, an identity of personal growth. But the enemy was within the ranks of the inner circle – a friend betrays a friend.In 2010, that identity continues but in a whole new way, the billionaire playboy Tony Stark continues his quest to rid the world of evil and mass destruction. But the enemy grows – and there is only one way to destroy it – an enemy from the Russian federation, an enemy with a grudge.In 2013 – it all comes to an epic conclusion – as we see in this final installment in this franchise – we see our hero as he faces something more terrifying than Obadiah Stane, more menacing than Whiplash, a firey Mandarin – this is no ordinary villain it brings out the worst in our hero and yet he begins to unravel before our eyes.What's next for our hero? Will he be back? Or is this the end This trilogy could not happen without the greatest actor of our generation – an actor who brought us to our knees in WonderBoys and created chemistry with Ally McBeal – Robert Downey, Jr. And an actress who loves to country croon and scream – Gwyneth Paltrow. To the villains – Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, Sir Ben Kingsley & Guy Pearce, - could there be more evil for Iron Man to fight? The 2 directors that brought all the drama, romance and yea – the sense of adventure – Jon Favreau and Shane Black, does Shane Black return or will Jon Favreau helm the 4th installment? All we know is that there is an..IRON MAN 4 in the works.This movie rocks.",10,15,24,26 June 2014
Iron Man 2," I think not
","The old saying goes that when people retire, they don't come back head strong. I disapprove very strongly whoever said that. When Iron Man come on the scene in 2008 as a remake of the original comic book, I said it wouldn't last. I was completely, out-of-my-freaking-mind, this movie rocked. I'm talking about Robert Downey, Jr. He may have had a rough beginning, but he has shown his true colors, especially the gold and the red colors. Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do – here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second. Let's give our props to Jon Faverau. Great movie, Great Job!",10,2,3,25 June 2014
The Hunger Games," May the odds be ever in your favor
","'May the odds be ever in your favor.' The Hunger Games is not just a movie of action and romance – it is a movie about survival of the fittest. The Hunger Games is about who can outwit the others. The Hunger Games is about finding your true self. But how can one find their self in a brutal attempt to please the one nation that created the games – The Capitol and the ruthless dictator of all time President Snow (played brilliantly by Donald Sutherland).With an all-star cast, directed by Gary Ross – who brought us Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, interwove the world that Suzanne Collins created. From Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) to Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) to Gale (Liam Hemsworth) to Cinna (Lenny Kravtiz), this movie defied all odds.I have nothing negative to say about this movie, it was a movie that will stand up against one other movie this year. A movie of a test of time standing still for one immortal girl, one immortal boy and clan that will have to meet their end in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2.But for The Hunger Games, thank you Suzanne for sharing your world with us. Thank you Gary Ross for your excellence in movie making. And thank you to the cast – you outshone and maybe just maybe in Catching Fire we will see more of your brilliant work.",10,0,6,26 June 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Plunging into Darkness
","We last left our friends on the USS Enterprise with peace and tranquility on board and on earth back in 2009 – but now all is not well in the galaxies and everything is not right in Star Fleet. There is a traitor amongst them – a traitor that holds a grudge, a traitor full of clout and darkness, a traitor that leaps for joy at the sight of death and destruction.John Harrison a.k.a. Khan is not your typical villain he is a villain full of surprises and leaves you on the edge of your seat thirsty for more destruction as he attempts to end Star Fleet as we know it. We are left wondering at every turn what Captain James T. Kirk (Pine) would do as well as his First Officer Spock (Quinto). We are left with questions what will become of our villain.Sowhat will become of our heroes from Star Fleet? Is there another adventure for them? Will Khan seek revenge? Those are questions what will be answered until we meet again.To Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before.",10,2,6,26 June 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Hydra Lives
","The Germans have invaded the United States of America, but with our people. I guess that is how I want to start this review, but one can only tell. Last time we left our hero, he was in cryo-freeze for over 70 years and then S.H.I.E.L.D came and found Captain America a.k.a. Steve Rogers. Then much to Fury's surprise the company had been ambushed by the same evil that they thought they got rid ofHYDRA. But through the unlikely of sources, Alexander Pierce (played wonderfully by the greatest actors of all time Robert Redford) – for you see the Red Skull a.k.a Schidmit was just the birth and now the past has come to haunt.But it all began when Bucky fell through the wintery snow of the Alps and Doctor Zola found him and made him into a killing machine and wiped all of his memories, including the memories of his best friend. I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for those of you who have not seen it yet, but I will say this – the war against Hydra has only begun and nowwell I'll let you decide that for yourself.This movie was the best that Marvel has ever done all thanks to the creator, the master mind behind of all these movies and comic books – Mr. Stan Lee – personally, you are my hero and you are our Captain – thank you for bringing your world to ours.",10,0,2,26 June 2014
Man of Steel," The Year of the Red Blue Blur
","Or as I like to call it – 6 Decades of Superman. It all started back in the late 30s but his name was just Superboy, then as the years and decades progressed this great phenomenon became the truth, the justice and the American way. Superman has graced our lives and hearts for 75 years ever since that one comic book hit the newsstands back in 1938 and now with digitally enhanced supersonic strength and digitally mastered special effects, we begin to hope again.This movie has outshone every facet of this superhero's life from the very first appearance on television with George Reeves to the incomparable Christopher Reeve then it went onto Dean Cain then television did it right again with Tom Welling then it went good with Brandon Routh and now the red and the blue returns for a new chapter with Henry Cavill as he joins this elite squad of the red blue blur.Everything about Man of Steel, was perfectly done and at the helm of it all Zack Snyder, who brought us Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen, Legends of the Guardians, Sucker Punch and now Man of Steel. And right beside him was the Batman Trilogy director Chris Nolan – excellent and superb job well done. The graphics, the CGI, the effects both sound and special – were out of this world.Speaking 'out of this world', I am reminded of what Jor-El once told his son Kal-El, 'Krypton lives inside of you wherever you go.' Superman a.k.a. Clark Kent will live inside all of us from now and into eternity.RIP = George Reeves (1959), and Christopher Reeves (2004)",10,3,6,26 June 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," 10 Years Ago
","Ten years ago, we were introduced to a young boy who had extraordinary magical powers and his destiny was to destroy the one thing he feared the most – death. In 2001, Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone showed us what true friendship meant. In 2002, Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets showed us courage and bravery. In 2004, Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban showed us it takes faith to trust. In 2005, Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire showed us, not only skill, but a test of power. In 2007, Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix showed us to open our minds and to 'not to tell lies.' In 2009, Harry Potter & the Half-Blood Prince showed us not to linger too much on the past. But in 2010 and 2011, a duel to the finish will determine to have the ultimate power – the power of love.Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows – Part 1 will leave a mark, not a physical mark, but a mark of urgency, a mark that is not seen – a mark to feel, a mark of love. I loved every aspect of this movie. I have to say a very BIG THANK YOU to the one person who poured blood, sweat & tears into every word written on the pages of magic – J.K. Rowling. Thank you for giving us 10 wonderful years of magic.I give this movie a mere perfect score of 100 – for everything from the special effects to the incredible artistry to the breathtaking scenery. The 3 stars – Dan, Rupert & Emma – we will miss you and we look forward to upcoming projects from you. This movie met every expectation that I had from reading the book. To close, I am a firm believer in finding my true destiny and Harry Potter me find it.",10,0,2,25 June 2014
Divergent," One Choice Can Transform You
","The United States of America is not what we once knew – the nation was split and the government was run out by factions – 5 to be exact: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite. With everyone in these factions it was going to be a peaceful world until one day one girl, one test result can change the way our minds can change who we are – Divergent! One faction the Erudite comes in and destroys the peaceful nation by catapulting a ruthless attempt to rid the world of Divergents and the overrule the government so they can get their way with the leadership of one woman – Jeanine Matthews (played beautifully by Kate Winslet.) I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for the people who have not seen the movie but I will say this – this movie was lacking in some places where things were left unsaid, action was left out and things were changed up a bit.This movie was an awesome way of letting dive into a young writers mind of how she sees the world, Veronica Roth who at the time was 23 when she wrote this book. The book was action packed and so was the movie, matter of fact the movie was incredible. The cast ranging from Shailene Woodley to Theo James to the wonderful Ashley Judd and Zoe Kravitz (yes that is Lenny's daughter!) to the villanious Kate Winslet.But the question remains is: Which faction will you choose? Let's hope Insurgent delivers.",10,3,9,26 June 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Red, Blue and the 4th
","We first saw Peter Parker, the kid who became the iconic hero of all time, back in 2002 when Tobey Maguire made him famous – but this goes all the way back, not just in yesteryear but during the comic book days. In 1963, The Amazing Spider Man hit the bookstores and comic strips, but now a days, we all need a hero.Peter Parker, (played by new-comer Andrew Garfield) was a troubled young man from the beginning, his parents leaving him behind with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (played brilliantly by the greatest actor and actress of our time Martin Sheen and Sally Field). During his adolescence, Peter was faced with bullies and the occasional spider bite. But it was not your usual spider bite, a radioactive spider with mutations beyond our capability.But when things get a little green, Dr. Curt Conners (played by Rhys Ifans, who brought us Xenophilius Lovegood in Harry Potter 7 Part 1), all he ever wanted was to make the human race understand the importance of being treated like reptiles – lizards to say the least.What an incredible timing to bring this movie before the independence of our country. What an incredible movie that Mark Webb brought us. I know Sam Raimi would be very proud, but Mark you, my friend out-done Sam in every way. The cast was brilliant, the story was awesome, the effects perfection.If I was Spider Man, the one thing that I would love to do – the web slinging. I would like to fly like Spider Man so that I can save everyone and be the hero of the Red and Blue.",10,0,1,26 June 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Past into Future
","The last time we left our friends all was right in the world, well with one exception, there was a mad man on the loose killing humans for the cause of the mutants. Now we come to the future or should I say the past or should I say the future. Matthew Vaughn did a great job with First Class, but Bryan Singer – OMG OMG this movie has given us more intel than we thought we would ever have.The past has come into the future, or so to speak to stop an unthinkable demise. I don't want to reveal too, too much for those that have not seen this movie, but I will say thisPatrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry – you brought the past into the future – you guys are the epitome of great acting. To the newbies – James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence (J-Law), Nicholas Hoult, and a slew of new mutants – everything was just superb in every single way.The movie defines what we should be in our future, not define us what we were once in the past. Let's not look to the past, but to the future. Thank you Bryan Singer for reminding us that it's not about the past, but the future.",10,3,5,26 June 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A Evil Arises in Middle Earth
","When we last left our compatriots, they were on their way to reclaim the Lonely Mountains from an evil fierce dragon – Smaug. Peter Jackson, the man who brought us the Lord of the Rings trilogy, gave us another thrill seeking adventure that led us down to the lair of a dragon so fierce that hot molten metal could not contain it.But a greater evil arises – darkness has begun across Middle Earth and the quest for the ONE RING has begun. And the ultimate destroyer has yet to be seen as we hear in that famous quote: 'One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.' Big props has to go to the duo villain of the story, Smaug & the Necromancer (Benedict Cumberbatch), again you have proved your worth as the villain of the story. I saw this movie in IMAX and it was incredible.I can't wait 'til the last installment in 2014.",10,1,5,26 June 2014
Twilight," The New Crave
","Ever the since the breakout of Van Helsing, vampire movies are coming in left and right. Twlight is one of those movies. I went to see it last night and I loved it. I have never read the books, but I actually sat there with one ear opened, the other is deaf. Rob Pattinson and Kristin Stewart gave remarkable performances. You watch they or the movie will be nominated for and Oscar. If I had to compare or rate Harry Potter to Twilight, Twilight would get a 10. Or if I had to compare or rate Van Helsing to Twilight, Twilight would get at 10. Look out Harry Potter, Edward Cullen is on the loose. For me, this movie would get a 20.",10,3,7,24 June 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Return to Middle Earth
","It's been 9 years since we left Middle Earth, but we never knew that we would ever return to the land of enchantment – the land of dwarfs, elves, wizards and even the littlest of people – hobbits. As the intro to the movie shows us, it shows us what will be and then tells the story of a young, but naïve hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He never knew of an adventure until a certain wizard showed up at his doorstep.But as the movie goes on, we are re-introduced to familiar faces – Elrond, Galadriel, Saurman, and the ultimate villain of the entire series – the 'precious', the conviving Gollum. All he wants is to live with the one thing that anyone could ever ask for – a long life of misery.It does not surprise me that Peter Jackson has revisited Middle Earth. It is a place of magic, a place of enchantment. We are just so intertwined into what was originally written by Tolkien and the magic of Jackson – it just makes you want to visit as often as you want.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the biggest movie of 2012 and what a way to end 2012. I can't wait to see what the next 2 installments will bring.",10,6,11,26 June 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A Web Slinging Sequel
","As Peter Parker (Garfield) a.k.a Spider-Man is living his life footloose and fancy free, New York City is at peace once again. But something evil is lurking beneath the waters or should I say electricity. As we see our hero balancing life and staying away from the girl he loves, he is forced to make a choice between the one that he loves and the city that needs him the most.On the other side of things, an old friend comes back into Peter's life, Harry Osborn (DeHaan), whose father has just died of an incurable disease (which by the way is untreatable) and apparently genetic and it has gotten Harry as well. I don't want to spoil the movie for those of you who have not seen it yet, but I would bet my money on a third installment.This movie defied all odds against the original 2nd movie – no thanks goes to Willem Dafoe, James Franco, Alfred Molina – Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Dane DeHaan, Jamie Foxx, Paul Giamatti – and the incomparable and talented Sally Field gave the performance of their lives. This movie will go down in Marvel History as one of the greatest super hero movies of the 21st century.",10,14,38,26 June 2014
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Best Vampire Movie
","Bravo Bravo Bravo Just one word: Unbelievable Congratulations to Stephanie Meyer and to the wonderful direction of Chris Weitz. I finished reading the book today at 3:30 p.m. and it met every expectation, the lines were perfect, the acting was superb, Taylor was hottt Oops did I say that!!! From the script to the acting to the beautiful scenery of Forks, Washington to the beautiful city of Italy. Everything was just amazingly accurate and breathtaking. This movie really brings out the best in Rob, Kristen and Taylor, they let their emotions fly and they were just phenomenal. I could not be a proud Twilight Fan and a true at that if someone had not encouraged me to read Twilight in the first place. I am now hooked beyond measure. I can't wait to see what Chris can do with the 3rd installment - Eclipse. This may not be a professional review, but it is a personal one. I thoroughly enjoyed myself tonight as I was captivated and kept on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to get this movie on DVD to add to my Twilight Saga collection. Again, this is a must see for anyone who believes in love and that love prevails against all odds.",10,3,8,24 June 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Unexpected Heroes
","It's nothing short of a miracle that there are heroes out there who can save the planet, but as for Peter Quill, who just lost his mother and his father is out to get him Star Lord a.k.a Peter, gets to go on a adventure that he has never dreamed up of. Along with an assassin, who is out to steal an orb for a powerful being who is out to destroy planets, that contains a stone that could destroy planets and beings, a raccoon, a tree, a powerful inmate, Peter takes back the galaxy and saves the galaxy from the ultimate annihilation. But what these unexpected heroes don't know there is a plot and an unknown evil who is seeking for stones to gain control over the entire galaxy that can spell ultimate doom for everything and everyone in it. This movie was good to say the least. The casting was exceptional, the graphics were superb, the direction was good. It was no more or no less than perfection, but it could have been a little more on the adventure side. I'm not saying it lacked adventure, it just needed more. I just can't wait to see the 7 stones, OOPS!, did I say that? Well, we'll just have to see what Volume 2 has for us.",9,1,7,10 February 2016
Clash of the Titans," The gods have spoken
","The power of the three gods – Zeus, Poseidon, Hades – have ruled the skies, the waters and the underworld for more than 3,000 years, now it's time for Hades to come out of hiding and reclaim Mount Olympus as his own. What Hades does not know is that there is a demi-god, Perseus, Zeus's son, and he will be the one to stop Uncle Hades from destroying mankind. Louis Leterrier directs an all-star cast from Avatar's Sam Worthington to Harry Potter's Ralph Fiennes to Liam Neeson, this movie proves its worth among the race of man. Clash of the Titans proves that it is worthy of Oscar buzz as well. This movie reclaims the gods have spoken and it's time to re-own Mount Olympus and the race of man.",10,1,3,25 June 2014
Alice in Wonderland," The Return of the Depp/Burton Team
","Stepping through a hole in a tree trunk just makes you want to travel back to a magical place where cats smile, animals talk, an evil red queen, a serene white queen and a hatter who is mad. The team of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have done it again. Since their Edward Scissorhands day, these two gentlemen have been inseparable. This movie really brings out Depp to a whole new level and character. There is one thing that this movie did not lack â€“ precision & laughter. Burton has done an exceedingly tremendous job. So, overall, I give this movie a smile and an ace. What will both Burton & Depp think of next? Can these two be inseparable? I can't wait to see what's next for this team. (10 Stars)",10,1,2,25 June 2014
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Forever
","We live in a world full of fantasy – fantasy that we can't explain sometimes. Everything has a purpose, everything has its place, everything has a forever. This is one forever that will last into the next life. It amazes me that 5 years ago in 2008 we were introduced to a whole new world that was created by a 35 year old writer who told a story of a mortal human being who was drawn into a world of vampires and were-wolves.Nobody knew that it would end up with a sad-happy ending. We were mesmerized by the way that these movies and books that have melted (literally) into our hearts. It's like we live in this world that I described a second ago full of make-believe, but for The Twilight Saga – it was so real. The Saga has been ingrained into our souls and left a chilling (so to speak) mark.As I was sitting there watching the movie, I was shocked by the way each part of it was so breathtaking. Each scene was so impactful. The books and the movies have made a mark in us that no other franchise has left in us – The Twilight Saga, will and always be a part of our lives for many years, decades and centuries to come no matter how old we are.Stephanie, thank you so much for your hard work and for sharing with us the story of our lives. To the many directors – Catherine Hardwicke, Chris Weitz, David Slade and Bill Condon – thank you for giving the vision to see Stephanie's work come alive. To Melissa Rosenberg – girl, you rock – your words are Stephanie's words, thank you for the craft that you have. To the composers – Carter Burwell, Alexandre Desplat, Howard Shore – you guys are the epitome of the Saga – thank for the music and for bringing artists like Linkin Park, Muse, Metric, Bruno Mars and Green Day on board.The last thing I do want to say before I close this great Saga Review – to the 3 people who gave us an enchanting vampire – Robert Pattinson – to the mortal who loved a vampire who he is and becoming the immortal that we loved – Kristen Stewart – and to the brown-nosed werewolf who gives his heart and soul – Taylor Lautner – you guys are what The Twilight Saga is about. So.Let's Start With Forever.",10,1,10,26 June 2014
Thor," The God of Thunder
","Open up the heavens and let the thunder come, because Thor will unleash his wrath upon the planets and the galaxy. I really wasn't supposed to see this movie, but I'm glad I did because it was pretty awesome. I actually learned something: don't mess with the god of thunder. Chris Hemsworth played the title role beautifully, Natalie Portman, she's great in any movie, but the wonderful Sir Anthony Hopkins – no one can compare to him, he is a god among men.Kenneth Branagh, 9 years ago played Professor Lockhart in Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets, did an excellent in the director's chair of Thor. I don't know what else to say about this movie, but it was really good and I was on the edge of my seat waiting for thunder to strike. As they say, thunder strikes twice in the same place.",10,1,2,25 June 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Bay/Spielberg At Their Finest
","OMG!!! OMG !!! OMG !!!! THE BEST BAY/Spielberg MOVIE TO DATE!!!! I have to give Michael and Steven their props. Of all the years, that I have seen Steven at work behind the camera for all his movies. This one outranks them all (including Indiana Jones). I have never seen such artistry come to life. I felt like I was standing right there beside Shia, being his partner and fighting the Decepticons. It was truly an amazing ride. I saw the first movie, but this one out-did the first Transformers movie. I hope that there will be a third movie. There has to be, they can't just leave us hanging on. But I do have to say this, Shia Lebouef has come along way since his Disney days on Even Stevens, now he is the new face in town and every boy is going to want to be just like him to save the day.",10,0,2,25 June 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The Beginning of the Story
","We left our band of misfits of dwarfs, hobbits and wizard on their way to the Lonely Mountain to defeat the dragon Smaug to reclaim the mountain but along their way to battle the dragon and take back the mountain, a certain evil arises in the west, high on a mountain full of fire and brimstone lays a certain shroud from ages before. A shroud that covers the west of Middle Earthbut we'll leave that for the sequels in the Lord of the Rings movies to tell that side of the story. This movie deals with the battle that ensues between the forces of dark and the forces of the good of those who have hope for Middle Earth. I am glad Peter Jackson went back to tell the story of how we begin our journey into the land of Middle Earth and how we came upon the One Ring. This movie was the breaking point between the gap of The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It brings that fresh depth of how we know the story. So what happens next? Well, it's all in the hands of one familiar hobbit.",10,1,3,10 February 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," Holy! Epic! Batman!
","Billionaire Bruce Wayne once said, 'I am moreit's what you do that defines you.' The question is: what defines us all? The fire has risen and that fire has been put out, but not yet though. One thing still remains: Is there a future for the billionaire playboy? Enough about playboys, let's chat about how we got here.In 2005, we were re-introduced to a boy who fell down a well and we saw what frightened him the most – bats. But he overcame that fear and struck fear into the hearts of those that knew the very existence of fear. Fighting against the mob, Batman took down the biggest crime lords of Gotham City – Carmine Falcone and gave the Scarecrow a taste of his own medicine.But in 2008, the war was not over, not even by a landslide. As Bruce Wayne was having battles of his own, Batman was posed as a threat to the city and plus a mastermind of theatricality, a brain as the size of a laughing matter, brought a new taste in life – SLAUGHTER WAS THE BEST MEDICINE! The Joker (RIP Heath!), portrayed one of the darkest villains of all time as he brought down upon the city and the new DA Harvey Dent and gave the word 'light' a new name.Now we come to 2012, no one expected this to come to a conclusion, we thought we were in it for the long haul. Let's just say it was bittersweet and a whole lot of punches and back breaking. The ultimate villain, Bane, gave violence a new name. A name that was synomous unlike any other. But Bane was not working alone. An arch-enemy came back to finish a job but through someone else. And the black was faded and billionaire was living his life and moving on. But wait something red approaches, something that will fly red colors – is it a red monster, is it a red wagon, no it is a RED ROBIN.For 8 years, the mastermind of Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathon gave Batman a new look and took the story to a whole new level. Thank you for teaching us that it is what we do that defines us. Christian Bale – you gave us an icon to live up to, you taught us to live for ourselves. Thank you. From Cillian Murphy to Tom Wilkinson to the late Heath Ledger to Aaron Eckhart to Tom Hardy to Anne Hathaway to Marion Cotillard – you guys defined evil. Thank you.Batman will live in our hearts for years to come.",10,5,8,26 June 2014
Thor: The Dark World," The Light at the End of a Dark World
","When we left our friends in Asgard, all was right in the 9 realms after Loki was thrown into an abyss for his selfish ways and almost destroyed everything the Asgardians hold most dear. But it has been 2 years since Jane Foster and Thor parted ways and now they are reunited because of a darkness that shrouds over Jane's inner body as she infects a most powerful and deadly weapon that could not only destroy her but the entire 9 realms – it takes a vicious monster Malekith (played wonderfully by Christopher Eccleston) to destroy all of the races in the universe to converge it all in darkness.But it takes Thor (Hemsworth) along with Foster (Portman) and Loki (Hiddleston) to save the day. But what we don't know may surprise us – that the Tesseract, the Aether, so close together creates something more deadly than what they could ever even think that could happen to the fate of the entire universe.This movie was excellent and I am looking forward to seeing what is next for our mighty god of thunder.",10,9,14,26 June 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Prophecy Fulfilled
","'The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approachesBorn to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month diesand the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows notand either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives.' It was over 10 years ago, we were introduced to a young boy who unlike any other boy thought that he was a normal 11 year old kid. But he wasn't normal – he was a wizard and that's how the boy Harry Potter melted the hearts of readers and moviegoers. The creator of this great epic phenomenon, gave us what we had foresaw – Harry Potter was and is and will always be a part of our lives. For you see, it was at the hand of a young writer by the name J.K. Rowling that gave us something to live for.I have been a true fan of this movement for 10 years and I can honestly say, that I am extremely proud to be a true Harry Potter fan. I could not have asked for more. I read the books and I have the movies, if anything that I have gained from both is that Harry Potter will always live within me and the fans that have graced the books and the movies. Tonight as I was watching the movie, I was thinking the entire 2 hours, how one boy at the age of 17, give so much of his life to save the world from annihilation.The prophecy is true when it says 'but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not' that power was and will always be the love of his parents and his friends. Thank you, Harry Potter for teaching us what it means to live a life of love and you have given us something to live for – a life full of hope and joy. Thank you, J.K. Rowling for allowing us to dive in your world of magic into the pages of Hogwarts and teaching us that magic lives within us. As Dumbledore says 'help will always be given to those who need it the most.' And one big THANK YOU to Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint – for allowing us to watch you grow up into fine young men and woman – we wish you the best in the future, we will be seeing you again and again.",10,0,2,25 June 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The Rebellion Begins
","The aim, the stare, the fire, the start of the destruction of Panem is growing dimmer and weaker by the minute, by the hour – all because one girl, one simple but head-stronged girl – who thought she was saving herself along with the boy next door, but all she did was defied the very existence of survival, defied the very existence living.We are now on the verge of the strongest revolts against the Capitol. We are about to embark the end of the beginning. The Hunger Games were just games but the Quarter Quell outdid every aspect of the way we saw the original games. But we are about see the awakening unfold between a ruthless dictator in President Snow and a girl, 'the girl on fire', but this war goes beyond them – it goes all the way back to surviving freedom.The cast was on the A – game – Jennifer Lawrence (J-Law) in one word – INCREDIBLE!!!! Josh Hutcherson – insanely incredible. Liam Hemsworth – freaking awesome. The rest of the cast and crew, you guys were really awesome, but the props has to go to my favorite 2 actors – the antagonist Donald Sutherland, you are the epitome of evil – you are an incredible actor; and Phillip Seymour Hoffman – kudos goes to you, you brought the position of gamemaker to a whole new level.Suzanne Collins – you are an incredible author, you gave us something to believe in and for that we thank you for allowing us to dive into your world. Thank you.Francis Lawrence – you are an incredible director and I can't wait to see what you have planned for Parts 1 & 2 of Mockingjay.",10,4,22,26 June 2014
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Best of #
","With Twilight, they played it safe; with New Moon, they stepped it up a notch; with Eclipse, OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!! I have to give props to three people: #1: The author – Stephanie Meyer – your books are so mesmerizing and not romantically challenged; #2: The screenwriter – Melissa Rosenberg – you stuck to the book, you added what you needed, you poured your blood, sweat and tears into the script; #3: The director – David Slade – DUDE YOU ROCK!!!!! This movie defines everything what Stephanie wrote in her 3rd book. I could not be a happy Twihard – this movie met every expectation that I had for the book and the movie. Again – Rob, Taylor, Kristen - OMG you define the epitome of acting. But the acting props has to go to Bryce Dallas Howard – Rachelle was good but you were beyond good. This movie was excellent I can not wait to see what is coming in Breaking Dawn.",10,2,6,25 June 2014
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Best of 3
","In 2007, we were introduced to a brand new species of another planet called Cypertron and the species that is not like any other - a species that protects the human race from extinction they are known as the Autobots. But to their dismay, the other side wanted something totally different to bring their own world to the planet that is was weak in their eyes – the Decepticons.In 2009, there was a revenge from the Decepticons to take the earth's sun to destroy it so that they could bring the world to a extinction, but the Autobots including its leader Optimus Prime fought his own brother, Megatron and his other brother, better known as The Fallen. Both Megatron and The Fallen had their plans foiled by Optimus and the only human who could understand them – Sam.In 2011, the Decepticons bring a whole new strategy to the big screen – they use a member of the human race to deceive the humans and the Autobots. The only way to stop the Decepticons to destroy them and to stop them from bring Cypertron and re-creating Earth to make it their home.These movies can't compare to any other Sci-Fi movie. They are what we call great entertainment. I have to give props to the greatest iconic director of all time – Steven Spielberg and the genius behind the Transformers Trilogy – Michael Bay. There is no one in the nation that can outdo these 2 gentleman. The cast was incredible from the boy who started the phenomenon – Shia Labouef to the newcomer girlfriend, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. The third movie was in one word – INCREDIBLE!!! I give Transformers a 8; I give Revenge of the Fall a 9; but I give Dark of the Moon a 10.",10,0,1,25 June 2014
