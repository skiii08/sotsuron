Requiem for a Dream," Wrenching tragedy.
","My summary was my first thought when the closing credits started running. We often refer to films as 'drama,' but the term 'tragedy' is not used much anymore.  This film can only properly be called a tragedy.There are so many things about this film that drew me in.  There are also a number of things I kept ruminating about for days afterwards.  Not only is this film a rare example of a true tragedy in recent film, but it is structured more like a play than a movie.  Movies tend to build to a massive climax that occurs near the end of the film.  From what I remember of college lit classes, many plays have a climax dead in the middle of the performance.  _Requiem_ is like that: the most intense part is in the middle.  The characters die with a whimper at the end, not a bang.  It is not a story of slow decline, but a story of rise and fall.I can't write about this film intelligently.  It really moved me.",10,0,1,5 March 2004
The Ring," Modern classic!
","This is the best pure horror film made in the US in many years. I must see the Japanese original. I won't give away any plot. This film scares (very effectively) without gore, without chase scenes, without gross monsters, and without startling sound effects. It scares with mystery and with its disturbing cinematography. It starts with a million questions: who made the lethal tape? How? Why do its viewers always die? Why would anyone make such a tape? Every question is answered, and every answer is an unhappy, twisted, and insane answer.I don't know why this film was only rated PG-12 in the USA. I have a friend who is 24 years of age who was unable to sleep all night after watching it.",10,1,1,2 November 2004
American Psycho," Black satire of 1980s America.
","Plot: Patrick Bateman seems like the ultimate yuppie. He has an Ivy League education, a top-flight job, good looks, confidence, fine taste in food, and a disciplined workout regimen. But there is something askew with him. Although Bateman is perfect in every way, he is perfect in all of the same ways as everyone else in his social circles. In achieving everything that is expected of him in society, he has become anonymous.Well, Patrick is going to do something about that!If you lived through the selfishness and materialism of the 1980s, this movie will crack you up as it horrifies you. I gave this film an excellent rating for its depiction of hilariously superficial Harvard-educated Wall Street types. This is not the usual depiction of the smug rich as comical boobs, but as deeply twisted and fundamentally empty people. In my experience, the latter depiction is closer to the truth.The main character's complete self-obsession is illustrated through his egotistical practices. These range from his endless physical workouts and 'metro-sexual' attention to his looks, to his ravenous desire for sex and violence. The on-screen sex could offend more sensitive American viewers, and th on-screen violence will offend most European viewers. Its still a very good movie, but be warned.Not for the faint of heart, but you won't forget this movie.",10,0,1,20 September 2004
The Incredibles," Cute little adventure films, with a hint of elitism...
","This is more of the good stuff we have come to expect from Pixar. It has memorable characters, funny dialog, and lots of action. In the movie, superheroes have all been forced to retire due to liability issues. Their super-battles did so much damage that society has decided to battle evil the old-fashioned way. Mr. Incredible and Elsatigirl try to make a go at 'normal' family life and forget their super-ness. However, Mr. I cannot let go of the old days, and his longing is manipulated by an evil genius to perfect killer robots. Soon, the whole family must emerge from normal life and use their super powers to bring down the bad guy. Thrilling action sequences and witty dialog ensue.If you want to find something wrong with this film, the only obvious flaw is that it is formulaic in plot and the characters are recycled from some comic book or another (in fact, the three quarters of the family is very similar to Marvel's 'Fantastic Four': a strong man, a stretchable person, a girl who can turn invisible and create force fields).An added bonus to this film are the philosophical nuggets it throws out. There is an obvious message that one should be true to one's self, instead of trying to conform to society. More subtle is the constant barbs against normal people the superheroes make. They bridle against the mediocrity that they are expected to imitate. The bad guy was not born with super powers, but made himself super through his hard work and inventive genius. The bad guy goes so far as to threaten to provide the world with inventions that will give all people super powers. Mr. Incredible opines that if all people are super powerful, than nobody is super.What does it mean? Do the Incredibles represent old inhertied wealth, despising the crassness of the nouveaux riches bad guy? Is it better to simply be born with advantages, or to create one's own opportunities?",7,2,4,13 June 2005
Event Horizon," Creepy atmosphere, aimless plot.
","This film is a ghost story in space. A rescue spaceship is sent to Neptune to rendezvous with the _Even Horizon_, and experimental ship that disappeared years ago after testing its hyperspace drive. The rescue crew reach the vessel, only to find it a derelict. As the rescue crew slowly uncovered what happened to the former crew of the unfortunate vessel, the rescue crew find themselves hallucinating and going insane.I gave this film a 5. The setting is really good. Neptune feels alien and creepy. The derelict Event Horizon feels like a real place... a serious achievement considering that it is supposed to be a starship. It feels like a visitor to another dimension. The dead ship filled with evidence of a murdered crew makes the _Event Horizon_ spookier than many a haunted mansion or isolated cabin in a Hollywood horror.Unfortunately, the plot never really progresses much. There is some lurking influence in the ship, but we never learn anything about it. People see things, they go nuts, but the whole thing lacks climax.",5,0,1,6 June 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," True stinkbomb.
","What a bore.  This film is nothing but a cheap rip-off of Hong Kong martial arts films and Japanese samurai movies.  I love kung fu movies, which is why 'Kill Bill' was such a disappointment.  Instead of making a film with great fighters and great fight scene, the director used hum-drum Hollywood actors with no stage-fighting ability, and then used quick takes and cuts to compensate.Save your $9 and go rent 'Once Upon a Time in China' if you want to see great fighting.",3,3,5,1 December 2003
Ran," Kurosawa's crowning masterpiece.
","This is Kurosawa's adaptation of 'King Lear,' set in feudal Japan. Lord Hidetora Ichimonji waged war all of his life to unify the valley. As an old man, he passes this throne to his oldest son, Taro, and grants vassal status to his other sons Jiro and Suburo. Jiro and Taro toady to their father, each harboring secret hopes to eradicate the other brothers (and old Hidetora himself). Suburo rails at his father's foolishness, warning him that by dividing power in the valley he invites generations of chaos and war. Enraged by Suburo's defiance, old Hidetora banishes him. True to Suburo's warnings, the country soon falls into strife as Taro and Jiro turn on each other, turn on Hidetora, and turn on Suburo.This is a magnificent film. Ten stars is not enough. The plot is as moving as Shakespeare. The performances are top-notch. The cinematography is exquisite. The costumes and sets are wonderfully rich. This contends for the best film made by Kirosawa, who is arguably the greatest director ever to have lived. If you have access to a big flat-screen television, you should watch Ran on it if possible.",10,2,5,15 April 2007
