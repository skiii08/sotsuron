",To all my Bookies and Movie fends. Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 was awesome!!! They actually made the first half of the book action packed and an emotional roller-coaster that will give you the information needed to understand the situation! But at the same time keep simple minded people entertained while doing it! Honestly they followed the book while adding events that simulated the plot in ways that I bet the author Suzanne Collins wished she would have thought of it. Maybe she did b/c she was a part of the screen writing! I truly loved how Jennifer was able to express Katniss' thoughts and feelings without uttering a word. She is the perfect Katniss! Actually everyone that is in this movie portrays their characters perfectly! All in all the movie was well done and stopped on a perfect moment! WELL DONE!,9,22,58,21 November 2014
