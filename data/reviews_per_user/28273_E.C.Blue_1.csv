Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Breathtaking computer generated F/X take the lead role, as the stage is set for the greatest sci-fi story ever
","In the most anticipated film of all time, Star Wars episode 1 The Phantom Menace, grabs you right away with two Jedi in their prime, and shows just a well trained young Jedi can do. It then blasts you to a pod race that is the definition of the word intense. All this is a set up for the four count it 4 layer finale. This film gives a few answers that fans have been guessing at for 15 years and a few old faces as well. But, we have all been watching mindless F\X blockbusters for 20 years, the reason that Star Wars is so huge is because we are ready to hear a great story again. Unfortunately this movie lets great actors go to waste, and has no characters for us to get to know very well. I very much enjoyed this movie, it really kicked ass, but I'm still left with a hunger for a great legend to be added to that outstanding light saber duel. Episode 2 perhaps.",7,0,0,22 May 1999
