Raiders of the Lost Ark," A blockbuster how it was meant to be
","Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.Of course the story isn't waterproof, the Nazi weren't that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is. Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930's they created their own legend. It's funny, exiting, thrilling and romantic. What more can you ask for?",10,214,283,6 December 2004
Alexander," Bisexual but also qualitatively in the middle
","If this was Oliver Stones 'dream-project' then I guess we were lucky that he was awake when he made his masterpieces like PLATOON or JFK.The brilliant and innovative camera-work of NATURAL BORN KILLERS seems ages ago when you look at the out-of-focus orgy here (yes, I went to the projectionist and complained). And not just that. There is no doubt that cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto has delivered beautiful pictures in AMORES PERROS or 25TH HOUR but it also makes sense that the cameraman of 21 GRAMMS isn't the right person to do shoot a blockbuster-epic. There are hardly any establishing shots and ever since GLADIATOR someone thinks its good just to shake the camera through battle-scenes so no one sees whats going on.Along with that, Alexander is like a play with a few characters showing only two of the hero's many battles which would be interesting but then the story is told much to fragmentarily and leaves way too many gaps.The great plus tough is that Colin Farrel portraits a bisexual hero and despite all the fuss from conservative Greek lawyers it totally works fine and is the rare example of showing a gay character not as either a funny sidekick, a wimp or a problem child but as a strong leading man.And the film definitely deserves credit for that.",6,1,3,3 January 2005
Zodiac," In the sign of the Seventies
","If you're expecting another SE7EN from David Fincher you'll be disappointed. ZODIAC is not a conventional thriller, in fact, it never shocks at all. Knowing that the real Zodiac-crimes where never solved and knowing that Fincher would never fictionalize a true story makes it difficult to move towards a climax.It's actual strength lies in the almost perfect citation of early 70's movie making. This works on three levels: The 'outer', meaning the look of the film. The colors are reduced but heavy, the camera-movements are as slow as is the editing.The 'inner'-level - the designs, the cars, the hair-dues, the phones, the clothes - makes you feel, you're watching an episode of 'Kojak'.And finally, the 'perceptional' level: As a moviegoer of the 21st century you are constantly faced with what it must have felt like to see a film in, let's say 1971. When someone gets killed, it's in a long, torturing shot - no 'bullet-time' here folks! It's a blessing for a change.Of course, when you think of San Francisco and Crime you think of DIRTY HARRY. And he actually appears in ZODIAC. As the film ZODIAC can't be. Because it's heroes - unlike Harry Callahan - go by the book. Interestingly enough that the character 'Scorpio' in DIRTY HARRY was influenced by the Zodiac-killings.The other movie that seems to be heavily influential on ZODIAC is ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. Because most of the crime solving here also takes place in an editorial office. At a time when there was no internet, no cell phones and even faxes where rare it becomes obvious that the main problem to find the killer is not the evidence but the communication amongst the observers.That's the center of Fincher's film: To show that in real live police-work is as vulnerable to human mistakes as is an argument amongst married people. And that serial killers are no psycho-geniuses, just every day lunatics.",8,2,3,7 June 2007
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Honestly? I didn't get it...
","TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY is a well shot film with great actors and beautiful art direction. But a story one can follow it has not. I don't consider myself the slow Joe in the last row, nor is my Girlfriend is that slow Jane but honestly each of us got maybe 25% of the story, half the film made sense when we discussed it later.Maybe one must read the book first because the approx. 400 pages didn't seem to fit in the 127 minutes of film. There's lots of off-text but that's no real help if the basic motivations are told in hints, half sentences or metaphors. That's not how storytelling works in film.It's a shame because I really loved Alfredson's LET THE RIGHT ONE IN which is a quiet film where a lot is said between the actual lines. For a cold war spy thriller tough that is not the right way to tell a story.",5,34,61,28 November 2011
Ocean's Twelve," Good but with a disappointing aftertaste
","OCEAN'S TWELVE is an entertaining sequel but it fails to accomplish its mission a)to be as good as Ocean's Eleven and b)to be a believable continuation of the first film.It's all to obvious that the screenplay was meant for another film and therefore what was so convincing in the first film, that the heist actually needs 11 thieves to be a success is missing here. Some of the actors don't really get much screen time, it's just like the red carpet at a premiere, everyone smiles but with no content.In fact the series of heists that take place here are always on the edge of being too confusing, it's exciting to watch, but in the end thinking of it, it seem more like chaos hiding the lack of a solid story.This series of discontinuity has its climax in the style of the film. I don't get why the same director and cameraman decides to change the style from calm overview images to in-the-face hand-held camera.From OUT OF SIGHT to OCEAN'S 11 every Soderberg movie was great. I think this had to end somewhere.",7,0,1,3 January 2005
Taken," Solid, Entertaining, Reactionary B-Movie
","I saw 'Taken' last night and must admit it is highly entertaining and recommendable albeit one shouldn't expect much political correctness. It's interesting this movie came out post- Bush because it reminded me a lot about the 'glourious' 80's where good was good and bad was bad. In fact the film takes up so many dusty clichés from 80s action flicks that it seems highly inspired by movies like 'Missing in Action' or any 'Death Wish' ... 'Film'.America is the save haven in this film, where everything is alright but former CIA man Mills (Neeson) gets alert when his young daughter wants to travel to Europe, the most dangerous place on earth. If you think by comparing the US with the average mid-European crime rate this must be a joke you're easily wronged by the fact that Mills daughter is kidnapped quicker upon her Paris arrival than the can say 'liberté'. After that you're hardly surprised by a Frenchman bringing home a baguette at night and unshaved Albanians always having a beer can and a cigarette handy. But if you can live with these black and white stereotypes you will see a highly entertaining movie and will also accept that even after all the debates about secret CIA-Prisons it's OK if Mills tortures a bad guy to death.Besides these reactionary spillovers 'Taken' is fun to watch, with Neeson who might seem miscast in a B-Movie is once again proving that he is still at the height of his career, delivering a solid Steven Seagal variation - including acting skills.The fact that it was directed and written by French filmmakers with an Irish lead makes this bearable otherwise the pro American message would be too offensive. But so it seems like a solid homage to the action films of the Reagan years with a wink. If you just had a bad day this film is the right one to cheer you up!",8,0,0,20 February 2009
The Matrix Reloaded," Way too much of everything.
","Another disappointing sequel although this one had everything to make it as good as the original: the same cast + crew and a producer that could raise any amount of cash they needed.But I suppose the success of THE MATRIX 'ruined' this one. In the first film 'they' (the directors and the cast) seemed like the knew that stories about 'the one' with tons of cheesy dialog and action that is definitely beyond realism must be told carefully in order to convince or it might easily become crap (behold BATTLEFIELD EARTH).So they did. Every word about the Matrix was believable every fight stretched the borders of credibility but never broke them. But with the knowledge that now they were doing the sequel to a huge success all this seems forgotten along the way.Every character - main or sidekick - seems to be aware of the importance of him/herself and its awful to watch them + Lawrence Fishburne has put on some weight. Come on, Larry! For the cash you make here you could at least drop a few pounds. And don't dare to start a drinking game here, where every time Neo says 'I feel' or The Orakle says 'You already made that choice' you're supposed to take a swig. You'll end up in hospital after this film.There's a 'heart-surgery' at the end that not just breaks medical borders but mostly the rules of believability. And when The Architect tells us that Zion was destroyed 6 times before then why the f**k should we care this time? This most consequent connection with THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is the continuation of this journey into irrelevance but that is another comment...",6,0,1,15 February 2005
