The Natural," Growing up wanting to be a baseball player is only one of the reasons I love this movie.
","The actors, the music, the scenery and the concept: baseball. What else needs to be said? Romance is still alive and it is in the dreams of all the young boys who want to step up to the plate in Wrigley field. This movie is perfect!",10,1,1,28 October 1998
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," What a movie! If only people could see war for what it really is...
","Peter Sellers genius reappears in his multiple protrayals of Captain Mandrake and Dr. Strangelove. He is just unstoppable, a brilliant character actor and a fresh wit. The movie was superb in its handling of a serious subject with appropriate humor. You have to pay attention to all the subtlety involved...'Peace is our business.'",10,1,1,7 November 1998
