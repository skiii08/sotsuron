Mission: Impossible III," What the hell is this crap!!!
","i think this film is really good with Tom Cruise at his best form. i give a 8/10 as the only bad thing about the film is that the story line wasn't good enough and things were predictable like Lindsey at the beginning dies and only that the agent that helped Tom at the middle was a bad guy. Manchester united suck by the way. The actions were amazing. It made me wet myself when the action began at the end. by the way, do you think Arsenal rule? i think so. And again i say this film is really good but only watch it when it comes out on DVD.# i think this film is really good with Tom Cruise at his best form. i give a 8/10 as the only bad thing about the film is that the story line wasn't good enough and things were predictable like Lindsey at the beginning dies and only that the agent that helped Tom at the middle was a bad guy.

",This film is quite alright in the start but i have to say the acting from the young actors aren't good enough. By the way Will Moseley used to be in my school!
