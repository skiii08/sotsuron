Skyfall," please no Ralph Fiennes
","what's up with you people ? i LOVED this film! my only problem with it is introducing Ralph Fiennes, who to me radiates cruelty and at the very least always triggers mistrust - I always am suspicious he's the bad guy. So why give him this role? why him? please BondMakers, rethink this and bring someone else in at the helm. NOT so OTT as I find most action films to be these days. Not sure about the choice of Bond's receptionist either, they went off kilter - her role is quite different in the books and they should stick to some things to keep it Bond. Loved the cinematography - Some of the scenes were beautifully shot - the Scottish manse in the light of the helicopter, for one.",8,3,8,12 February 2013
