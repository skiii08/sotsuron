The Blair Witch Project," Scary, but meaningless.
","I'm not going to deny that The Blair Witch Project is one of the scariest horror movies out there. After all these years, I still have trouble walking through the woods at night because of this movie. Even during daytime, thinking about this movie in the middle of the woods makes my heart beat faster. But does that make the movie any good?One of the positive things I can say about The Blair Witch Project is that it doesn't rely on jump scares, meaningless gore or silly characters like Freddy Krueger or Jason. It shows that it's possible to scare people without cheap tricks. There's also no unnecessary nudity, or any graphic sex scenes in it (the language is bad, though).The worst thing about the movie is that it's meaningless. We're just watching a bunch of people get lost in the woods, where they are finally killed off by something supernatural. We're not left with any hope when the incredibly scary credits roll.I guess the movie could serve as a terrifying warning against playing with the occult or paganism, but I can't really recommend it. There are better horror movies you could watch, like 'Whistle and I'll Come to You' from 1968. Or even better; read the original story by M.R. James.",2,2,9,18 April 2018
Batman Returns," Batman, unfortunately, Returns.
","It's a bright, sunny day when that terrible trio The Penguin (DeVito), Max Schreck (Walken) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) show up and threaten the fair citizens of Gotham City. Luckily, the caped crusader (Keaton) appears in the nick of time and saves the day!'You've done it again, Batman!' Says Gordon, played by Pat Hingle. The two friends shake hands, and Batman jumps into his batmobile and drives away into the sunset.Just kidding, this is the one with the perverted mutant Penguin and zombie Catwoman. Michael Keaton does a good enough job as Batman, Christopher Walken is Christopher Walken, Pfeiffer's Catwoman is painful to watch with her forced sexiness, and the Penguin is a nightmare. Not because of the acting, but the character is unpleasant. I don't know what Tim Burton is trying to say, but it seems to me that he wants us to feel sorry for the Penguin.While everyone should get a second, or third or even fourth chance, it's impossible to find anything good about the Penguin. Sure, I feel bad when his parents throw him off the bridge, but as an adult he's pure evil. People didn't hate him because of his appearance...they gave him a chance from the moment he came out of the sewers. He's not Edward Scissorhands or the Elephant Man. The worst part is his death scene, with the sad music and crying penguins. Save your tears, a mutated, (but prettier) Joseph Stalin is dead, and the world is a safer place.Returns is in many ways a mean-spirited and ugly movie. The part where the Ice Princess is kidnapped and killed is a good example. As a kid, I really hated that scene...Batman just stood there and watched as the damsel in distress fell to her death. Another is when the fat clown is shot because he doesn't want to kill children. Maybe those scenes are supposed to be horrible and tragic? Probably not, it's a Burton movie.But, there are some positive things here as well: wonderful designs, the batsuit looks fantastic, Michael Gough is perfect as Alfred. The best part about the movie is probably the music by Danny Elfman. It's sad that they wasted all that talent on this crap. Tim Burton should have stayed away from the Batman sequel. If he wanted to make a movie inspired by German expressionist films, he could have made something original instead. Maybe a comedy sequel to Nosferatu...Nosfera2: Bite Harder?",3,39,64,19 April 2017
Blade," Van Helsing wins.
","What a stupid movie Blade is. It's a perfect blend of most of the things that were wrong with the 90s. Style over substance, violent anti-heroes, extreme blood and gore, bad music, bad CGI, unnecessary use of sunglasses and fat, flatulent people...the only reason people rate this disgusting movie higher than 'Spawn' is because of the gore. It's a very strange movie. The movie tries very hard to make us think Blade is a tough guy, but it's so forced and unnatural. The tacky opening, where blade shows up at a rave party and kills a bunch of vampires is embarrassing to watch, especially when he does that weird 'ooooh yeeeaaah' gesture with his arm. There's a disturbing Oedipal theme in this movie too. It's so blatant that I even noticed it as a kid. The absurd quote about 'motherlovers' suddenly makes more sense now. Maybe there's a deleted scene of Blade trying to ice skate uphill on YouTube?If that's not bad enough, wait till you see the flatulent, naked, Jabba the Huttish vampire who sounds like a smurf. And people took this movie seriously in 1998? They probably wanted a piece of The Nutty Professor's success. Fortunately, Blade and his mothe...I mean, girlfriend tortures the vampire to death with UV light because he's fat and ugly. The movie isn't really about 'good vs evil' either, since according to this movie, the Crucifix is powerless against vampires (they took away the most interesting thing about vampire movies). Still, there are supernatural elements in the movie. The vampires worship a pagan deity called 'the blood god', and we are shown pages from a 'vampire bible'. Overanalyzation time!Does this mean that the blood god created the universe? If so, why does Blade rebel against his creator? And why does he hunt down and kill vampires, they're just a poor minority trying to worship their god. The vampire religion is shown to be the true one, right? So in a sick and twisted way (this is a sick and twisted movie, after all), Blade is Lucifer. Now, I highly doubt that is what the filmmakers were trying to say, but when you remove the Catholic element from vampire movies, they become meaningless. I bet the filmmakers like all decent Hollywood types didn't want to offend anyone by including Christianity in a wholesome movie about mindless violence, incest and half-naked women. But what are vampires anyway? If they're just freaks of nature, why all the supernatural stuff? Skip this garbage and watch a good vampire movie instead. Like Terrence Fisher's Dracula movies or the excellent BBC version from the 70s. Or better yet, read the original novel by Bram Stoker.",1,5,15,17 April 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Thorformers Camp & Rock aka Batman & Robin just got better.
","Thor: Ragnarok makes me wonder how Batman & Robin would have been recieved if it came out today. Batman & Robin is actually far more serious than Thor: Ragnarok! There's real drama to be found in Batman & Robin. Alfred's illness, Mr Freeze's wife...Schumacher didn't ruin Batman's speech near the end by having him trip in his own cape/get electrocuted/knock himself out with a batarang. And as campy as Batman & Robin is, at least they didn't portray Batman as a stand up comedian. The endless jokes in Thor: Ragnarok makes it impossible to care about Asgard or Thor's friends who are killed by Hela. The threat in Batman & Robin felt more 'real' than in Ragnarok. Almost every single scene is played for laughs. 'Devil's anus', 'orgy ship'. It wouldn't surprise me if there's a deleted scene where Odin lets out a big fart before he dies. It's sad, because some of the jokes are actually pretty funny.The awful Led Zeppelin song they used in the trailers show up twice in the movie when Thor fights a bunch of computer animated creatures. Because every single comic book movie needs 'classic' rock music these days. How lazy! One can criticize Batman & Robin for a lot of things (sexual innuendo, whiny Robin, rubber butts etc), but the score by Eliot Goldenthal is absolutely heroic.I don't mind jokes and funny situations in comic book movies. Stuff like that has been around since the beginning...but when everything is treated as a joke, the whole movie becomes pointless and depressing. If Thor: Ragnarok is considered one of the best superhero movies ever, perhaps people will regard Batman & Robin as a misunderstood masterpiece in the near future. What's the difference between seeing Batman's rubber buttocks, and Hulk's computer generated cheeks?",3,3,10,17 April 2018
Blade II," Painful
","Blade is back in this much gorier and CGI-ier sequel. It's more of the same garbage, but with a pinch of dog excrement added.If the pansy vampires from the first weren't bad enough, we now have 'Reapers', mutants who feed on blood suckers. And since this is H.P. Lovecra...uh, Guillermo Del Toro, it needs to be as disgusting as possible (at least he didn't include his fish fetish), with the reaper's jaws breaking open, revealing a leech-looking tongue.The vampires seek out Blade to help them exterminate the Reapers. This time, Blade has a new, marijuana smoking sidekick, a resurrected Whistler and the 'Blood Pack (tm)' to help him kill the new monsters in the goriest ways possible.The whole movie is like a nightmare, and not in a good, classic horror movie way. It's hard to describe, but imagine if your uncle Larry decided to travel to hell and when he came back, he wanted to show you his vacation movie. Everyone is a foul-mouthed sadist in this movie. Everything looks and feels disgusting.We're so lucky we even get to see our 'heroes' dissect one of the 'Reapers'. Why? Because Troy McClur...sorry, Del Toro, wants to shove disgusting things in your face. If you watch the behind-the-scenes feature, it's revealed that they used sex toys and fake semen to make the Reaper's innards. That should tell you something about the quality of the movie. There's also a strange scene at a vampire night club, where a woman's back is cut open and the spine is exposed. What's the point?The twist near the end, where Blade's new kid sidekick is revealed to be a traitor is so stupid and illogical I almost laugh when I think about it. Earlier in the movie, it's revealed that Blade saved the stoner from two vampire girls (yet another excuse to add vulgarity). He 'planned it all along'. Yeah, right. How does that even work? 'Plan A: Rip my intestines out of my body. Then, Blade will show up and save me. He'll probably kill you two, and I'll quite possibly die myself. Plan B: ...wait, there's no plan B? Who wrote this plan, David S. Goyer?'The fight between Blade and the main reaper Nomak is like watching someone else play Mortal Kombat on Playstation 2. I'm don't expect realistic physics in a comic book movie, but at times Blade looks like he's a big-headed, rubber puppet bouncing on a string. When the movie finally ends (at a peep show, where else?), the words of the tragic villain Nomak echoes through my mind: 'it...it hurts no more!'There's no beauty in Blade 2. There's no goodness or truth. I'm not sure if it deserves to be called a movie. It's a waste of time, money and film. Like its predecessor, it's just meaningless garbage. Save your time and watch/read something better.(Del Toro ripped off his own movie in Hellboy. I'm talking about the sewer battle. How lazy!)",1,4,10,17 April 2018
Alien," In space...no one can hear your funny parody of the original tagline.
","Alien is a hilarious movie about a man called Sven who decides to move from Sweden to Japan. Unfortunately, he never bothered to learn Japanese. Hilarity ensues as Sven mistakenly signs up as a contestant in a sumo wrestling match!I'm of course joking, but I would rather see that movie than Ridley Scott's dreadful movie again. It's not because 'the special effects are dated!'. The special effects are fine. The concept is okay, but unoriginal. They did the 'trapped with a deadly alien creature' stuff long before 1979.Whatever you do, don't watch this movie late at night with the lights off! You could fall asleep. The movie is so darn boring...I don't mind slow movies, but in Alien, nothing interesting happens in between the alien attacks. Probably because the potty-mouthed characters are so uninteresting and unlikeable. But the cat is cute, though.The movie is best remembered for the chestburster scene. I read a review were the writer said that the only scene people talk about is this one. I thought about it for a moment, and I guess he's right. I've heard about it since I was eight...the chestburster is the only thing that makes Alien original. The problem is that the scene isn't even any good. It's just an excuse to show lot of blood and gore. And blood and gore isn't scary. 'It's an allegory for (whatever)!' Maybe it is, but allegory doesn't necessarily make a movie any good. Sometimes, a piece or crap is just a piece crap.(2 stars for the cat)",2,7,20,24 April 2017
Suicide Squad," Directed by The Joker
","Suicide Squad aka We're The Bad Guys is almost as bad as Batman v Superman. Nothing in this movie makes any darn sense...I watched it with an open mind, but it's impossible to enjoy this movie, or care about any of the characters. If Batman v Superman can be compared to sleep paralysis, Suicide Squad is what happens when you eat one of the strange mushrooms that grow in the woods. What a weird, Transformers 3-ish movie! The only thing that's missing from the movie is Shia LaBeouf.This movie could have been good. Even though it's a movie about fictional comic book characters, they could have used those characters to explore stuff like the cruel treatment of prisoners in the US, corruption, redemption, forgiveness etc. There's bits and pieces of that sprinkled throughout the movie, but most of the time it's about boring slow motion fight scenes, Harley Quinn's buttocks and really bad jokes.The best part is when Harley Quinn imagines herself living a normal life with the Joker. It's really sad that they wasted a scene like that in a terrible movie like this...Imagine if someone made a movie like that, where one of the villains actually managed to change. That would truly be something new and original in a comic book movie. Joker/Two- Face/Killer Croc gives Batman a message to meet him at the abandoned toy factory/bell tower. We expect a big, violent fight scene, but instead, the villain breaks down and cries. I'm not against action and fight scenes...but modern superhero movies brag about how they're for grownups, grounded in reality and all that stuff, yet everything is solved by punching people in the face. It's no different than any of the old serials (which I love)...the only difference is better costumes, nihilism and half-naked ladies. Why not try something new instead?The writing is terrible...it's embarrassing. It made me blush. The choice of music (Eminem, Queen, Ozzy Osbourne) is bizarre. The music seems out of place. None of the characters are convincing. The dancing Enchantress is probably one of the worst things ever in a comic book movie. It's almost as bad as Batman's rubber butt in Schumacher's homoerotic Batman movies. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be funny or serious, but it is beyond ridiculous.Just read or watch 'Mad Love' instead. It's a better Batman/Harley Quinn and Joker story.",2,3,9,17 June 2017
The Thing," Not a good thing.
","John Carpenter's The Thing is a movie that's mostly remembered for its disgusting special effects. Remove them, and the movie isn't all that special. It has some scary parts, but most of the time it just relies on lots of gore and cheap jump scares. The Thing is also a very boring movie. I had the same problem with Alien, nothing very interesting happens in between the monster scenes. I didn't care about the potty-mouthed characters in either movies. None of them are likable.***Warning, spoilers for the original Thing!***The original The Thing didn't need any gory effects to frighten people. It is one of those meaningful sci-fi/horror movies you rarely see these days. It has a message. Scientists shouldn't mess around with dangerous things (heh). Unlike the remake, the old version had a more optimistic ending. I miss stuff like that in modern horror movies. That a movie can be scary and still have a happy ending. Carpenter's movie is just meaningless and depressing. The Thing shows up, slaughters a lot of dogs and people, and in the end everyone (eventually) dies. Hooray! Just like in real life, right? Except for the part with the scary alien monster, of course.I don't think nihilistic crap like that is necessary in movies like this. I'm not saying that the movie should have ended with the monster turning out to be old man this or that, and with Kurt Russell winking and saying 'Rooby Rooby Roo'. But there should always be some glimmer of hope at the end of a movie. There's enough horrific stuff in the real world, can't we at least let the good guys win in the movies?",1,5,29,5 May 2017
Duck Soup," Not that funny.
","I usually love old comedies. Laurel and Hardy makes me laugh so much it hurts.But Duck Soup is extremely overrated. There are some genuinely funny parts, but most of the time it only made me chuckle. It's just endless one-liners and some mean-spirited slapstick scenes that last forever. I also didn't like the creepy sexual stuff near the end of the movie. It's 'mild' compared to modern movies, but still...I didn't see the last few minutes of Duck Soup, but I really doubt those minutes would change my opinion.I haven't watched a lot of the Marx Brothers' comedies, but if this is their best movie, I don't want to see their worst...",3,2,10,25 June 2017
American History X," A fascinating look into the minds of Hollywood liberals,
","American History X has a good message. Hate and racism is very bad. Unfortunately, so is the movie. I can't believe that this movie is considered such a masterpiece. I'm not even sure if this movie is serious or not. Is it a piece of liberal propaganda, or is it a satirical comedy made by a conservative who wanted to show us how many liberals see the world? Most likely it's propaganda...but sometimes it's hard to tell.Because most of the time, it's not even about real racism. Except for some hateful comments, most of what Derek (and his father) says during the dinner table scenes isn't shocking at all. A black person could have said the exact same thing. The filmmakers took valid political positions and added a small pinch of Adolf.According to American History X, you're racist if you're against affirmative action. The movie also seems to say that black people are animals. They're not responsible for their own actions. They commit acts like rioting and looting because they're scared of white people or angry because of the oppression. The movie is mostly remembered for two things: the gay prison scene and the curb stomping. Everyone is talking about those two scenes when they bring up the movie. I almost think the filmmakers did it on purpose, they added shocking stuff so that people would talk about it. I remember that all the 'cool' kids bragged about having seen the part where the nazi is violated in the shower.There's also a completely pointless sex scene right before the curb stomping. I wonder why the director thought that was a good idea. But then I remember all of the other bizarre stuff in the movie. Derek's transformation from nice young man to a neo-nazi is not convincing at all. 'It's nagger bullshot, son!' 'Gee, dad, I guess you're right! Racism is awesome!' And his transformation from a neo-nazi to Gandhi. 'Haha, a funny magical negro! Who knew that black people had the ability to tell jokes? And he hates the KKK too, what are the odds? We have so much in common..!' At the end of the movie, Derek's brother is shot to death by a black kid. It's just a pointless and depressing ending. It doesn't offer any hope at all. It's sad that American History X is one of the most popular movies about racism. Imagine if they made a movie about real racism, without magical negroes, fake neo-Nazis, liberal propaganda and unnecessary graphic violence and sex. A movie that treated black people like humans. The real Nazis here are the filmmakers. American History X is just a piece of propaganda made by a modern-day Goebbels, designed to make viewers think that conservatives are Nazis and that black people are helpless animals.",1,16,44,9 May 2017
Dirty Dancing," I didn't have the time of my life...
","...and I owe it all to this piece of crap. The characters are all unlikeable, except for the father...to a certain degree. The rest of the characters are dry-humping babykillers and Randroids. To be fair, the Randroid character is supposed to be unlikeable (the easiest way to make a character unlikeable is to make him a fan of Ayn Rand's insane ideas. How lazy), but at least he didn't pay for abortions.Growing up, I remember all of the girls talking about (and quoting) this movie. Personally, I don't think any girls should ever witness Patrick Swayze's character rubbing his manhood against women. If I remember correctly, this movie is rated '11' where I live...what the heck? More like 'Filthy Dancing'.Swayze's character is also a manwhore who sleeps with old women and almost beats a guy to death because he insulted his girlfriend. How romantic?The movie's ending is hilariously stupid. What a strange movie...it's supposed to take place during the 60s, but the song is clearly from the 80s. Maybe the movie is in the same universe as Back to the Future or something? Maybe there's a deleted scene where Biff Tannen inspires Patrick Swayze's character to rub his crotch against things.Not that the music is bad. It's the dirty dancing and babykilling I didn't like.",1,3,16,9 November 2017
The Dark Knight," Jingle bells, Batman fails
","The Dark Knight is one of the most well-made, modern movies. Christopher Nolan shows restraint when it comes to CGI, there are no unnecessary slow motion scenes, 'cool' fight scenes or naked people to be found here. It's refreshing to see a movie made in the old-fashioned way. Artistically, it's great. Morally...not so much.One of the biggest problems with The Dark Knight is Heath Ledger's Joker. Unlike 'Batman Begins', there's just too much focus on the villain and his cruel and disturbing acts. Much like Jack Nicholson's version, he almost becomes the main character, the 'hero' of the show. People think he's funny, and laugh when he performs his pencil trick. He's also nearly omnipotent...heck, Ledger's Joker could probably kill Superman.When villains are portrayed in this manner, many people will start to root for them. People think that they're 'cool' and start to sympathize with them. Just look at fictional serial killers like Hannibal Lecter. When more and more kids want to dress up as the Joker or Harley Quinn instead of Batman or Batgirl, you're doing something wrong (Black Panther suffers from this as well).Filmmakers should be very careful in how they portray villains. I don't believe everyone who watches violent movies will wake up one day and find out that they want to study at Charles Manson's serial killer college...but we should keep in mind that some people are more impressionable than others. There were plenty of disturbing, Joker-inspired crimes being committed after the movie came out. Someone even mutilated themselves to look like The Joker. To say that stuff in movies (good or bad) never inspire people is a lie. A good example someone else used is 'Birth of a Nation', which revived the Ku Klux Klan. Again, I'm not saying that the movie alone killed anyone, only that filmmakers should be more careful.Not that Batman is a saint in this movie either. Lying, mass surveillance, cruelty towards prisoners etc. 'I see now what I have to become to fight men like him'. For Batman, the end justifies the means. The whole movie is about Batman failing to be a hero. People often ignore this just because the movie is (artistically) good.Batman Begins was far from perfect, but still a better movie than the previous attempts by Burton and Schumacher. The Dark Knight is a step back into the nightmarish and anti-heroic world of Batman Returns, only without the mutated 'pervguins' or zombie catwomen. Very sad.It's fashionable to ridicule the old Batman serials these days. The silly costumes, outdated special effects, the racism in the first one...but at least those movies portrayed Batman and Robin as a heroes. And I really doubt that kids wanted to dress up as Dr. Daka/The Wizard when the end credits rolled!",3,1,9,8 May 2018
Pulp Fiction," Putrefaction
","For some strange reason, Pulp Fiction is regarded as a masterpiece, and its director a genius. According to some ancient legends, the movie is supposedly so awesome that most of its fans lose the ability to tell us exactly why it is so darn good.One of my friends used to talk about how great Pulp Fiction was after he saw it with his stoner dad. I had of course heard positive stuff about it before, and decided to be polite and watch it when he showed up at my apartment with the DVD. We turned it off after maybe seven hours or so. Some people will say: 'but you didn't watch the last 20 minutes!!! It's the ending that is good!'. I'm sorry, but I don't have to go outside and eat dog crap to know it's bad for me.I really can't understand what's so great about it. When people talk about this piece of crap, they usually bring up the 'distoibing' gimp scene, the fat Travolta dance or the part where the hit men accidentally blow the black guy's head off. Clap...clap...? My friend didn't even say why he liked it. He just had a blank look on his face and repeated: 'bring out the gimp, bring out the gimp' over and over again. Okay, so the last part didn't really happen, but I bet he only liked it because his father told him it was good. But why did his father like it? Drugs? I think many people brainwash themselves into liking Tarantino movies. 'It's Tarantino, therefore it's good! It's Tarantino, therefore it's good!' Had Tarantino made Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill or Inglorious Bastards under a pseudonym, people would just laugh and say 'what kind of Uwe Boll garbage is this?'.",1,33,75,5 May 2017
The Wrestler," Like there's something wrong with just wanting to have a good time.
","The Wrestler is like a newspaper story made into a movie: 'Old, dirty, drug-abusing wrestler gets a second chance. Ruins it because he's a selfish idiot'. A waste of talent, time and money.It's just a meaningless movie with an unlikeable main character (not that the other characters are saints either). It's strange world we live in, where people want to see movies about jerks who do drugs, sleep around, fail their loved ones and destroy their lives. That depressing garbage like The Wrestler called art by some is also a mystery (well, not really...these days, taking a crap in public makes you an artistic genius).Someone already did the unlikeable loser ruins everything-stuff many years ago in a Swedish silent movie called 'The Phantom Carriage', but they did it the right way. That movie is also dark and ugly in parts, but doesn't resort to profanity and pointless nudity to tell the story. It didn't have a stupid ending either. Or you could just watch Santo in the Wax Museum instead...",1,5,12,17 June 2017
Wonder Woman," Finally, a good DC movie.
","I always hate action movies where the main character is a woman. 'Look, people! She's tough as nails! She said the F- word! She doesn't give a damn! She's like a guy without a wiener!'. Heck, I don't even care that much about Wonder Woman either. Maybe it's because my older brother forced me to be Wonder Woman when we played Superfriends as kids? Who knows. She's just never been on any of my Top Ten favorite superheroes list......which is why I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the Wonder Woman movie. This is what Man of Steel should have been...It's (for the most part) lighthearted and optimistic, and the main character is so good and sweet, like Christopher Reeve's Superman. This is probably one of the best superhero movies since Spider-Man 2. How refreshing to see a female hero in an action movie who retains her femininity when most female 'heroes' act like (insert that word for female dogs). There's none of the politically correct, childish 'girls rule, boys drool' garbage that plague modern movies here, just a fun, entertaining comic book movie with likable main characters.I also think it's cool how this movie unintentionally debunks Neil DeGrasse Tyson's nihilistic propaganda from BvS. In Wonder Woman, people are made in the image of a god (not THE God, but WW is just a fantasy movie anyway). We now have two comic book movies that kick DeGrasse's grass, the other one being Doctor Strange.The only problem I had with it was some of the language and unnecessary sexual content. But it's pretty mild compared to most of the slime that runs out Hollywood these days. Hopefully, Wonder Woman 2 will be even better. Trivia: According to some comic book historians, the creepy guy who created Wonder Woman based his character on Margaret Sanger. But if that's true, why didn't Wonder Woman kill the baby in London?",9,4,18,9 November 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Uncle Zack's bootleg Batman and Superman figures! Batteries not included.
","Sigh...I can't get over how weird and nightmarish this movie is. It reminds me of the Tom & Jerry cartoons by Gene Deitch. Sure, the characters on the screen look like Tom & Jerry, but they don't act like them. It's like that time when your uncle gave you one of those cheap bootleg Batman figures (Bat-Cop, Bat Detective etc) for Christmas. It just felt wrong.Batman is based on the grumpy old sadist from Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns (how original), only more violent. He makes Keaton's Batman look like Gandhi. He also looks unintentionally hilarious with the huge, fake muscles on the suit. A more expensive version of the ones little boys wear when they play Batman. I bet there's a deleted scene out there where he glues fake hair on his chest and puts socks in his underpants too.And Superman...I can't even remember any of Superman's lines. The only thing I remember is Henry Cavill standing there looking tired and annoyed. He's just there to be killed off by Doomsday.BvS feels more like a horror film than a superhero film. Dark, disturbing, nihilistic...I don't think superhero films should make people depressed. They even have the overrated Neil DeGrasse Tyson show up and tell us how meaningless life is and how worthless we (humans) are. I feel especially bad for all the kids who saw it. I heard one boy say to his mother: 'I think it's scary'. I wonder what they thought when they saw the parademons? 'Why did the scary ninja cockroach kick Batman's butt?'Skip this crap and watch a real superhero movie instead, like Superman 1978 or Spider- Man 2.",1,6,14,18 April 2017
Signs," Scary movie made even scarier by the truth about real aliens
","Signs is a very underrated horror movie, almost as good as The Sixth Sense. The actors all did a great job, and made the whole thing believable. Before I saw the movie, I had no idea how scary it was going to be. The part with the TV news report with the alien sighting is one of the most disturbing moments in a horror movie. I remember the hair standing out on my neck the first time I saw it. I still have trouble watching it. Probably because it feels like we're watching a real news report. And although I'm not a fan of jump scares, the scene with the alien hand under the door is pretty darn frightening.Even though it's a horror movie with aliens in it, it's predominately a movie about the loss and rediscovery of one's faith. The aliens could easily have been replaced by zombies or giant, flesh eating koalas. The aliens are just stereotypical aliens, humanoids without clothes. I suppose some people were disappointed by this, and perhaps wanted something like the xenomorph. Personally, I think they're way scarier than the creature from the Alien series...the xenomorph is like a shark, a dumb animal. The aliens from Signs are home invaders from outer space.Aliens have always been popular in Hollywood and in comic books etc. Most people like stories about visitors from galaxies far, far away. Star Wars, Avengers, Superman...they're usually portrayed either as evil invaders or advanced peacemakers.Scientists are eager to find life on other planets (SETI). Some of them have even gone so far to suggest that, since life here on earth seems to be designed, we must have been created by little green men. Other scientists have also speculated that we humans are a part of a computer simulation made by these aliens. Evolutionists desperately want to find aliens, as a way to discredit religion.Many people all over the world claim that they have seen UFO's or have even been abducted by aliens. It's certainly possible that many of them lie or suffer from false memories/sleep paralysis. But every single one? Unlikely. Something is really going on here.After years of researching the UFO/Alien phenomenon, most of the serious UFOlogists have come to the conclusion that these beings aren't really aliens from outer space at all. Abductees say that these beings can walk through solid objects, use telepathy, take over your mind...UFO's are known to change shape and defy physical laws. So what are they really? According to the well-known UFO researcher John Keel (The Mothman Prophecies): 'The UFOs do not seem to exist as tangible, manufactured objects...The thousands of contacts with the entities indicate that they are liars and put-on artists...'And it gets worse. Here's a quote from Jacques Vallee:'An impressive parallel can be made between UFO occupants and the popular conceptions of demons.'John Keel:'The UFO manifestations seem to be, by and large, merely minor variations of the age-old demonological phenomenon.'Whitley Strieber, an author who claims to have been abducted by aliens (the story was made into a movie based on his book 'Communion', with Christopher Walken as Strieber):'It was hell on earth to be there (in the presence of the entities), and yet I couldn't move, couldn't cry out, couldn't get away....Of course they were demons.... and I couldn't get away.'The famous occultist Aleister Crowley told that he had contact with a strange being called 'Lam', which he drew on a piece of paper. The being looks almost exactly like the stereotypical 'gray alien' you see everywhere. Google it if you dare.This is all pretty disturbing, huh? And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Some (secular) researchers have even discovered that the 'aliens' go away when their victims cry out for Jesus. Also, the 'aliens' often tell abductees that they are our masters, that they created us. They want to be worshiped, and tell their victims that Christianity is false. You hear about these strange and disturbing UFO cults...members claiming to be in contact with a higher, alien consciousness. They believe that the so-called aliens are our saviors that will give us superpowers and save us from ourselves. The Alien/UFO phenomenon is closely linked to the occult.These entities have supposedly disguised themselves throughout history, usually based on our latest 'fads'. First, they appeared as pagan gods, then strange creatures like fairies etc. During the Victorian times, spiritualism that was all the rage. In our modern, 'scientific' era, it's aliens. The aliens and UFO's have also altered their appearances based on how aliens are portrayed in popular culture. From human-looking aliens to grays, from rockets to glowing balls of light.I'm not saying that people like Keel, Vallee and the other researchers believe that aliens are demons. As far as I know, none of them have/had any religious beliefs. According their theories, aliens are something called 'interterrestrials'. But really...how is this any different from fallen angels?Does this mean that the aliens in Signs are supposed to be demons? Some fans have suggested this. They can be harmed by water (holy water), and in the end the aliens in Mel Gibson's house are defeated by God. The news report at the end say that the rest of the aliens were defeated by using an 'ancient method', possibly prayer. If I remember correctly, this theory has been debunked by the director himself. They're 'real' aliens from outer space. Anyway, the thought that so-called aliens really are demons makes Signs even scarier...(There's actually a documentary revealing the truth about aliens coming out this year, called 'Alien Intrusion', based on a book by Gary Bates)",7,0,3,10 November 2017
Beowulf," Garbageowulf
","This movie is an insult to the original poem.I have to wonder why some people make movies based on stories or characters they hate (as the director himself has admitted). I also wonder how anyone can hate Beowulf, one of the greatest stories ever told. How is that even possible?When I first heard that they were making a movie based on Beowulf, I was so excited. I could almost picture it in my head. Misty landscapes, dark, scary forests...I looked forward to the epic battle between Beowulf and Grendel, and the heroic (and tragic) fight with the dragon.What I got instead was a soulless CGI movie made by people who really hate Beowulf. A deconstructed version of the epic poem, full of politically correct nonsense. Beowulf isn't portrayed as a hero in this movie. Instead, he's a lying manwhore who sleeps with everything that moves. Grendel is just a poor misunderstood creature and King Hrothgar's illegitimate son. Almost every male character in this movie is stupid/evil/perverted/cruel and likes to have sex with female monsters.What's the point? Why make movies like this? Movies where the hero is as bad as everyone else, or worse. It's immoral, mean-spirited and dangerous. It's cynical, anti-heroic, anti-Christian, anti-male and extremely boring. What a nihilistic piece of trash.I hope someone'll make a good version of Beowulf in the near future, but I really doubt it. This should have been made much earlier, when someone like Ray Harryhausen lived. Modern filmmakers aren't interested in heroes like Beowulf, they only want to deconstruct and politicize everything.Someone should make a movie where Robert Zemeckis life is deconstructed in the same way he deconstructed Beowulf.",1,1,5,19 April 2018
