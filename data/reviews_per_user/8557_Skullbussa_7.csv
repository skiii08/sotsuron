Source Code," Uninspired, half-baked thriller left me clock watching
","A tired movie begets a tired movie review.Look, I just left this film feeling like somewhere, some tiny speck of original thought crept into the screenwriter's head when he was writing this movie: The film does make the audience think. A brain puzzle in the same vein as the (much) superior 'Inception', this film just constantly reminds the viewer how we are in the hands of mediocre talents who are too lazy to see an idea through and rely upon tired concepts to caulk together a story. There is no need to poke holes in the pseudo-science surrounding the out-of-body concept employed in Source Code; it is immediately self- contradictory as our protagonist wanders into areas (train station, other train cars) that his host never did and therefore could not have known for Colter to experience. Unlike Inception, which doggedly follows its own rules of dreams, the world of this film writes, breaks, and re-writes the rules.But this really isn't the biggest problem with the movie. The biggest problem is the ridiculous and ham-fisted approach Colter takes to finding the bomber. He thuggishly roughs up a variety of passengers, wasting the viewer's time with red herring after red herring. Our director wastes a golden opportunity to weave one hell of a whodunit and instead spends precious time trying to develop a love story nobody gives a hoot about.I do not feel that I know anything more about these characters at the end of the film as I do at the beginning and I certainly don't care about them any more either. What could have been the emotional high point of the film, a phone call that Colter places to his father, is handled so poorly that I threw in the towel and just waited for the lights to come on.",5,27,52,2 April 2011
Man of Steel," Cavill, Costner, Crowe, and Lane can't save this mess
","The four captioned actors do a splendid job selling the exposition to an audience who has become very familiar with the legend over the years. Costner in particular has two exceptional scenes with Cavill where we learn that what makes Superman super is not just his powers from Krypton but from what his adopted father has taught him about being a man.Frankly, other than the first act that these four actors give us, Man of Steel is arguably little better than the last tedious entry into the Superman film franchise. Once Superman is encouraged to 'just be himself' by his Kryptonian father Jor-El, the film very quickly degenerates into a exceptionally boring slug-fest that is more than a little reminiscent of the Transformers films. And this begs the question, if Superman so values human lives, why does he choose populated areas for his fisticuffs? Entire buildings are destroyed as part of the collateral damage. Why not lure the fight into unpopulated areas or even outer space? Surely, as skyscrapers collapse in the middle of downtown Metropolis, innocent lives are being lost?But Superman does seem to care very much about saving Lois Lane, played by a very doughy- looking Amy Adams. They quickly go from two people introduced as a matter of circumstance to lovers kissing; strange, as it seems the characters share very few screen minutes together. There is no palpable romantic tension or chemistry between these two characters. Zero.After about 10 minutes of watching Superman wrestle with a cheap-looking CGI monster, I realized that this film had absolutely very little that was original or inspired about it. It is a quite-frankly desperate attempt by Warner Brothers to resuscitate a much-needed franchise; this film will be a moderate success but that is not good enough. It needed to be at least as good if not better than Batman Begins and this film is not even in the same league as that film, flawed as it was. In summary, it is a film of a mixed pedigree (Nolan vs. Snyder, one an established artist and the other not so much) that makes a few smart decisions regarding efficiency of exposition but ultimately succumbs to a third act that is astonishingly dull. Newsflash: 15 minutes of characters pounding the hell out of each other is not better entertainment than the same scene condensed into a few minutes.",Null,9,18,14 June 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Much better than it should be
","Mostow's a hack, Arnold has lost his machismo over the years, and the story of T3 is nearly the same thing we saw 10 years ago in Cameron's T2.So why is this movie *the* summer action movie of 2003?Because it avoids using tacky, modern, computer special effects (*cough*...Matrix Reloaded) and instead uses classic Hollywood stunt work and REAL cars smashing into each other.  Because it has a tight narrative that doesn't indulge itself while keeping the audience hostage until the climax we all paid $8 for.The (surprisingly thin) audience for this flick on July 3rd was only happy to oblige the film with applause and laughs. This movie is great fun, much more fun than Hulk or Matrix 2.  There is something charming about an action movie where the hero actually looks like a hero rather than some pallid dork in a black trenchcoat who is more interested in looking good than pounding their enemy into a pulp.The best action sequences of the summer of 2003 are in Terminator 3, no question about it. The movie cost $170 million and you see every cent on screen.  Arnold's T-101 takes more and more damage as the film progresses. You first see blood, then scaring with metal underneath, then complex CGI/makeup/prosthesis where you can actually see THROUGH Arnold's jaw structure.  This is Stan Winston's best work in years and proves he is still at the top of his game.Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor was always an annoying character and it's good to see her out of the series to focus more attention on John Connor.  Sarah always came across as an anti-social, bitter hippy rather than somebody who has the burden of man's ultimate survival on her shoulders.
The script is nothing amazing, although it has an excellent ending that gives the film some real gravity.  The film is full of humor and resembles the original Terminator film more closely than T2 in this regard. 
If you want to know what T3 is like think of it this way:Take T2, strip out Sarah Connor, take out about 30 minutes of worthless boy/robot bonding and ridiculous man/machine sentiment (remember that horrible weepy ending to T2? LOL!), add an Arnold who is less apt to mock himself and a very serious, somber ending and you have T3.Really the only thing lacking is T1000 from T2. Robert Patrick did a great job, and don't get me wrong...the chick who plays the T-X does a great job as well, but for some reason she just isn't as menacing. She seems to not be able to handle good old T-101 as well as the T1000 could.  I would also really like to see her in a bathing suit.",Null,0,0,4 July 2003
Lincoln," Is this Spielberg's worst movie?
","Make no mistake, this is not art nor is it even a movie: in fact it is nothing more than a recording of a play thats only aspirations is to be shown in high school classes across the United States for many years to come.My faults with the film:-Spielberg's Lincoln speaks only through tedious, predictable allegories. These speeches are so boring that more than one character simply walks away during it's interminable running. I wish I could have walked away too.-Black people are treated as oracles and not human beings. The black characters in this film exhibit no manner of humanity and are reduced to simple plot devices. We don't care about their plight because they're not like us. They're heartless machines.-Relations between races in this film are portrayed in a dishonest way. Black soldiers and servants openly challenge and speak to Lincoln as if he's a fellow black man. This isn't the way things were and pretending that it was (from the very first scene!) simply disallows the film from building any heart, any credibility, any weight or substance. We learn quickly this is not a film about an important American historical figure, it is a (very) liberal interpretation. Since we do not see how poorly black people were treated we do not care about Lincoln's ultimate success with his proposed 13th Amendment.-Characters do not develop, character arcs fizzle, conflicts left unresolved. What of Mary Todd Lincoln's impassioned speech to Lincoln regarding the enlistment of their son? She demands to be locked up in a crazy house if the senior Lincoln permits his son to join Grant's side. Well, Robert joined the army and Mary Todd is still in Washington. What was the point of that scene other than to give Sally Field something to do? Why are Sally Field and Joseph Gordon-Levitt even in this film? They have no bearing on the narrative this film attempts to tell!Look, I did not expect this film to give an accurate representation of Lincoln's life. What I did expect is that I would get a tight, entertaining 2 hour slice of our greatest President's most critical hour. Instead I got a pandering, meandering, vapid, and vacuous play- on-celluloid treatment from one of the former cinema greats. This preachy, hunky-dory disease has plagued Spielberg since we were treated to those awful Present Day scenes in Private Ryan. Here it culminates into a suffocating veil which absolutely ruins any hope of this film being a success.Thoughtless, generic, boring drivel.",3,52,98,12 March 2013
Super 8," Worth it for the first hour but ultimately derails in the end
","I simply cannot understand how someone who is clearly talented can put together an hour or more of really fun summer movie and then blow it.The homages to Jaws, Close Encounters, and E.T. are a real hoot but really ring hollow when you start to see the chinks in the films armor. The interaction between the children and the period costumes and set design are the star of this movie, not the script. The monster and his tale of trying to get home are simply there to push the narrative and it is clear that Abrams has no joy in telling that story.Once the girl disappears from the group the film basically loses all energy, the characters begin to act erratically, and the suspension of disbelief is exhausted.I wonder what Spielberg must have thought previewing the final cut of this film. Did he shift in his seat and wince at the absurd ending? Did he think of ways he could have done it better?I'd love to see Spielberg go back to making movies like this. It will never happen. And it's a shame, because he did it better than anyone.",7,3,8,10 June 2011
Zombieland," Why do people from my generation love this garbage?
","I am tired of self-referential, 'clever', witty, quirky films; films where characters are straight off of the Judd Apatow assembly line. You know, the obnoxiously talkative, obsessive-compulsive, love-lorn nerdy Jew, the sassy yet droll, wise-beyond-her-years teenage girl, the big- mouthed outrageous hillbilly. This is a slickly-produced but very hackneyed retread of every teen comedy released in the last several years. There is not a single part of this movie that shows even the least bit of original thought. Simply put, this movie is an embarrassing exercise in fan service; jam-packed with tons of Hollywood references, gratuitous (but pointless) zombie carnage, and the timely popping-up of cutesy text...all of it there to remind us just how *cool* and *smart* the filmmakers are.How can people in their 20s/30s not see through this ruse? When movies make an effort to try to tell you how clever they are they cease to be clever. I suspect that many of those who are (idiotic) enough to give this movie more than a 4 rating are probably Kevin Smith/Joss Whedon fans who have difficulty discerning between a film and a tapestry of scenes of 'witty' dialog sewn together.Compare this to Robert Rodriguez' superior 'Planet Terror'. It's full of colorful characters we haven't seen before played STRAIGHT. The tone of the movie is serious and that's what makes the film so much more entertaining (and funny). And most importantly, we're spared the constant reminder of just how precocious the filmmaker is.I give this movie 3 stars instead of zero due to an inspired title sequence.",3,2,9,25 March 2010
Platoon," Does not live up to its reputation...
","I put off seeing this film, despite being an Oliver Stone fan, after getting more than my fill of Vietnam war movies. 15 years after its theatrical release, I had the chance to catch it for the first time on the special edition DVD (an excellent disc, btw).My reaction?This film has aged very poorly. Either that or it wasn't much good to begin with. I noticed that almost all the situations are hackneyed (young, innocent solider getting killed without any reason, the Southern 'good old boys' as war mongers, the immoral murder of simple villagers, etc).  The dialogue is flat. Charlie Sheen is, as always, absolutely horrible. It is embarassing to see him up on the screen with such talented actors as Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe. He is just absolutely out of his league. Johnny Depp is given a tiny supporting role when Stone should have given him the Sheen part...Depp being the (much) superior actor.  In fact, we spend way too much time with Sheen and not enough with Forrest Whitaker, Depp, and Keith David.As others have commented, this isn't a narrative but a collection of individual scenarios that Stone has put together. Unfortunately, most of these scene are present in other films and done much better (Full Metal Jacket).The lines that Stone draws between the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys' is absolutely ridiculous: the bad guys are generally racist Southerners and the good guys are enlightened potheads. They're about as two dimensional as you'd expect from a war movie.If you want to see a great war movie, skip this one. Full Metal Jacket and The Thin Red Line are more raw and engaging than this film will ever be.  To be perfectly honest, the documentary included on the special edition DVD is much, much more interesting than the movie itself.One final note: Tom Berenger holds his own against Dafoe, Whitaker, and Depp. I am very curious as to why his career never took off as those others did. He controls every scene he is in and this viewer was hanging on every line that he delievered.  What a shame he is stuck doing garbage like 'The Substitute'....",Null,0,1,4 August 2001
