It," Don't listen to the good reviews
",This movie totally ruined the first one for me too. It lost all of its magic and was too concerned with useless chat that went nowhere. The horror ambiance only lasted for about 15 minutes. I think the actors did as good as they could have though. It was watchable but not enjoyable.,2,0,2,6 September 2019
