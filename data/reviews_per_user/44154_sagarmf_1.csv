Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Is this a Film???
","Is this a Film??? Borat is one of the worst, most disgusting movie that I have ever seen. A brother is kissing his sister.... O my God, Specially from a Muslim country!!!You should not do like that. You are making people angry and enemy. And people are giving 10 points.... Sick you are sick... the director, writer all are sick. You have changed the meaning of film. I am feeling very sorry. You can not take off someone pant and make people laugh. The is no brain-work, no planning, no story. I guess you wanted to make a special movie which is different from others, but you have made a rubbish.Why people went to see the movie? Answer: Strong marketing and media. I want to say to media, Please help the good films to come to the front.I collect DVD movies. But this film has no chance to be in my Film Library.",1,7,14,24 December 2006
