Sucker Punch," Great start, acceptable plot, absolutely irrelevant action scenes.
","First 5 minutes, is the best start that I've ever seen in movies. But as plot expands, and specially when action scenes get involved, you kind of feel this is not the movie that such beginning deserves. I think using that type of action was absolutely pointless and very wrong since it damaged drama atmosphere drastically. But if you just cut out action scenes, without any further edit, you'd have a way better movie. And not just better, but a great one. I guess action was forcibly injected in Sucker Punch's plot only to complete the money attracting elements of sexuality and violence. As final word, first 5 minutes is worth seeing over and over. Rest of the movie, not so bad to see once. But if you ever wanted to watch it again, be sure to skip all action scenes.",5,0,2,31 July 2012
