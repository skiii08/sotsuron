Ford v Ferrari," Ford v Ferrari(2019)
","I love a good film based on historical events. I knew I had to see this in IMAX format as soon as I heard about it. I'm not the biggest gear head but I do know the talent of the cast involved and the director involved so I knew we would be getting something worth watching. Having seen this in IMAX now, I will say that this film needs to be seen in that type of high quality to feel the rush, intensity, and thrill of the races. This film is a bit long in the tooth but a great watch.The film is about the real life events of Caroll Shelby working with Henry Ford the Second to build a fast race car that would beat the best Ferrari has to offer. Shelby has a limited time frame to work with and enlists the help of hot headed Ken Miles, an exceptional race car driver who is initially at odds with the Ford company. The film follows their bond and their progress as they not only build the car but go head to head with Ferrari during the 1966 Le Mans race.The film's racing sequences are some of the best in a car themed movie I have ever seen. Heightened by the theater experience everything was eye catching and intense. On top of that you have two extremely charismatic leads who do very well in their roles. The film also has humor here and there. Its a very interesting and inspiring story and you don't have to be a car fanatic tot enjoy the film. James Mangold's quality behind the camera shows with every detail captured.My main complaint for the film comes from its running length. its a long 2 and a half hours and at times feels its length. I couldn't help but think a good half an hour could have been left on the cutting room floor. Its a one time watch through and through but a great effort. I think the film will be up for some of the more technical aspect Academy Award nominations. If you are a film lover, you need to see what is arguably the best racing movie ever.8/10",7,1,3,17 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 (2017)
","It has been a while since I've seen it, but the original Blade Runner is a fantastic sci-fi film and up there with some of the best of all time. Ridley Scott used to be such a cutting edge filmmaker and the themes and visuals of the original Blade Runner still resonates well all these years later. When I heard about Blade Runner 2049, I was mixed- but only for a little bit. I love Ryan Gosling and Ana De Armas is stunning. The trailer looked like a visual feast and the attachment of Dennis Villeneuve heightened the hype surrounding the picture. Having seen it on opening night, there are many positives albeit some problems and concerns I had.The film takes place decades after the first film where K (played by THE GOS) is a newer modeled replicant who is also a blade runner tasked with taking out older models. He stumbles across a mystery of a replicant giving birth, which was previously thought to be impossible. He is tasked with finding that child but must also stave up the forces of Wallace, who is a prominent creator of replicants. K also unearths information about Deckerd who has gone into hiding since the events of Blade Runner.The first thing I have to praise is the absolutely eye-popping, crisp, and vivid cinematography. The scenes are phenomenal. The sheer gorgeous nature of the picture is worth seeing it in theaters all by itself. This is expected with the legendary Roger Deakins and Villeneuve at the helm. The bright lights and barren landscape of the future are just stunning. The CGI is some of the best you will ever see. The soundtrack is loud and at times jarring but very effective in mood and tone setting.I actually loved seeing Ryan Gosling's K in a relationship with the computerized but very intelligent girlfriend, Joi. I love Ana de Armas and love that she's getting more work after Knock Knock. Sylvia Hoeks, who I really enjoyed in The Best Offer, is also ridiculously compelling as a menacing villainous henchwoman to Wallace. I had problems with Wallace's motivations. His dedication to go after the child born from a replicant doesn't seem strongly motivated. He's also speaking too prophetically and metaphorically a little too often. The writing has a few holes in it. Its not perfect, but is acceptable and is complemented by stunning cinema display and action.The film is very long. I think 20 or so minutes could have been condensed to make the film a little more succinct and effective. It was always going to be hard making a sequel to Blade Runner. Was it necessary? Absolutely not. Does the film deliver? Yes, its one of the best visual films I've ever seen. Is it great? Almost. It seems like the type of film that could use a re-watch to let the plot and and character displays really sink in. Its still a really admirable effort from Villeneuve, who is one of the top filmmakers going today.7.5/10",7,1,4,7 October 2017
First Man," First Man (2018)
","Let's face it, Damien Chazelle is probably one of the best directors going around today. Add the fact that he is still really young as well as a filmmaker. Whiplash is absolutely excellent, and La La Land was an incredible musical. Thus naturally, First Man was a really anticipated film for me and add to that the fact that Ryan Gosling would be portraying Neil Armstrong. This just seemed like it would be an amazing feature, so naturally I wanted to catch this one in IMAX. I think the film is good technically, for its performances and content, and for the portrayal of the moon landing. However, the films length and pacing were problematic for me.The film is about the life of Neil Armstrong, the famed astronaut who became the first man to land on the moon in 1969. The film covers other preceding portions of Armstrong's life, including the loss of his young daughter, his relationship with his family, his early work and training with NASA, his general mindset and personality, and all the events going on leading up to his eventual moon landing. The film also stars Claire Foy as his wife, Kyle Chandler, and Jason Clarke.I felt like the pacing and length of the film were the real problems with the film. its a good film technically and hardly puts a foot wrong but its a slow build and takes its time to get to the Moon landing. Gosling plays his usual quiet natured sulky lead, I'm not sure if this was an accurate portrayal of how Armstrong was but I had no problem with it. The performances were good otherwise. The leads may not get end of the year nominations or wins but I think they did a very respectful job in their roles. I expect the film to get its technical nominations as its sound design and cinematography are as good as can be.The film has all the ingredients to make it great but doesn't connect with me quite like Chazelle's other works in Whiplash and La La Land. It doesn't have that emotional connectivity like those works did, much like Neil's emotional block with his wife and kids. Its worth a watch to see the incredible moon landing experience and learn about the life about an American pioneer otherwise. Its a film that's steeped in tragedy and loss and great wonder and achievement.7.5/10",7,1,4,14 October 2018
Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette (2006)
","Sofia Coppola is probably my favorite female director going today. Thematically her films are an excellent depiction of loneliness, isolation, and a longing to be. I'm super excited for The Beguiled and thought it would be nice to revisit some of her earlier work. I re-watched Somewhere and Lost in Translation recently and thought both were excellent. This is one I watched a while back and needed a fresh opinion on and honestly seemed like her most daring work so I was looking forward to seeing it once again.The film is about young Marie Antoinette archduchess of Austria, her marriage into French nobility and her time and demise as Queen of France. I've always been a fan of Kirsten Dunst, I think she's quite underrated as an actress (see Melancholia and S2 of Fargo). Her pairing with Sofia Coppola works really well; Coppola gets the best out of her regardless of whether this is an authentic representation of how Marie Antoinette was. Its wonderful to see the pressure that is put on Antoinette by others and how this leads to an untimely end for her reign.We get another Coppola film showing a very lonely female character. Marie has to keep up to the prim and proper standards of 1700 France and be ladylike despite just wanting to live and have fun. She seeks a relationship and connection with a partner, one of which does not come easily. She has no meaningful compatibility with her husband Louis XVI of France which really impinges on her happiness. Along with that the tiring task of the day to day expectation of being queen.I think Sofia Coppola really did well taking liberties on a historical drama. There is a presence of a humorous take and satirical approach to depicting the often ridiculous customs of the time. The set and costume design is superb proving that Coppola can handle a period piece even while putting an anachronistic spin on it (with the modern soundtrack). The modern soundtrack actually helped put an atmospheric touch on the film. Overall, its probably not the best of her work but its still a really strong effort and goes to show why we really shouldn't care about negative critical response.7.5/10",7,0,1,17 June 2017
Deepwater Horizon," Deepwater Horizon (2016)
","Peter Berg is a fairly streaky director. He's had some pretty bad films (both Hancock and Battleship) come to mind but then again Lone Survivor was not bad and had some gripping action. I think Berg is in a place where he trusts an actor and trusts the formula of bringing a real life event to the screen. That's basically where Mark Wahlberg and his past, present and future film is (Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day). As mentioned earlier Lone Survivor's depiction of war and the action based cinematography kept your eyes glued to the screen, so how would the followup film stack up? The trailers for the film were not interesting. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill and explosion was obviously a disaster and a sad event but was it worth a film? The build to the events of the disaster are slow. You sit through a lot of the jargon of the oil drilling world. I'd say its easy to lose interest in the first third of the film, especially if you don't get invested in the film's characters. You also have to sit through some bad accents (which is a pet peeve of mine). The films got a fairly good cast to boot and for the most part there are no faults acting wise. Gina Rodriguez was convincing, I haven't seen anything with her previously but she delivered. I also liked Kate Hudson in the small doses of the film that she appears in. She seemed like a raw character who was genuinely afflicted with her husbands situation and the up in the air nature of his safety really showed through in the emotion of her character.I'm a fan of Mark Wahlberg. He doesn't always choose the best projects but he might be on to something co-oping with Peter Berg for a few films. You won't complain about Wahlberg being the hero here. Once the disaster occurs the pace picks up which is a good and bad thing. I'd say the first act was not very engaging and sort of set the tone for the rest of the film. The action depiction is great. There are moments of it that will captivate you and depending on who you are you will be moved with the raw emotion depicted in the film. Be warned though, that the event is prolonged so there's not much else going on outside of the event. I saw a lot of similar camera-work from Berg in this and Lone Survivor. The camera at times seems to be a spectator just set as a fly on the wall for the events. The camera-work also becomes frenetic and pacy, which adds to the atmosphere set by the very scary and unpredictable event.Once the disaster occurs and the film really starts rolling, there is decent satisfaction. I thought this film was better than I hoped, which is really much better than my expectations going in. However, its not a perfect film and can't stay wholly engaging. Worth a watch for the peeps who like Berg/Wahlberg or are fascinated by the event. Otherwise, your response to this film may (much like mine) be rather indifferent.6/10",6,6,10,20 December 2016
It," It (2017)
","I grew up with the 1990 TV miniseries adaptation of this Stephen King novel and really liked it. Admittedly, the second adult portion of the film wasn't as good but as a whole the film resonates with me mostly for its very memorable Pennywise the Dancing Clown, played by a stellar Tim Curry. I caught a late night of showing of the 2017 incarnation of this story, and wow. I'm quite impressed with what I've witnessed. The trailer for this film actually looked really promising, with Bill Skarsgård looking menacing as the clown.The film takes place in the town of Derry during the late 80's. A group of outcast and bullied kids band together to form The Loser's Club. Their social issues are not the only reason they bond; all of them are being terrorized by a monstrous entity that takes the form of a clown. The losers must find a way to overcome this clown that feeds on their deepest fears and feeds on children in the town every 27 years. Most of the cast for this film are fairly new (including the not so well know Bill Skarsgård), apart from an excellent Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things. However, a giant strength this film has over the original is the chemistry between the cast, and the overall humorous and identifiable nature of the child actors.I had doubts about this when Cary Fukunaga dropped out as director but liked that he stayed on to co-write. I've got to say Andy Muschietti does well to put his name out there with this film. Well done on making this film Rated-R. The violence and terror and adult themes really get to be portrayed well, which really amplifies the horror level. The initial scene with Georgie and Pennywise in the sewer was legitimately horrifying and we can thank the rating for that. The film is a coming of age film but also a real loss of innocence film. The kids in the film face very disturbing adult themes. The bullying is downright traumatic, the sexual abuse and death surrounding these characters isn't even the worst of it with a maniac clown stalking you to death.Skarsgård does very well as Pennywise. I still prefer Tim Curry' Pennywise more but this film has one to closely match. Skarsgård's tall lanky frame and disturbing delivery make the 2017 incarnation of the clown a thrilling, captivating and even more evil update to Curry's. The film does well to blend humor, emotion, and horror together. The kids are funny, there are times they will have you rolling. Finn Wolfhard with his unfiltered potty mouth is a standout. Sophia Lillis delivers a deep and mature performance for a child actor.There are many similarities between the 1990 version and the 2017 remake. I never read King's novel (although I am planning to do so) but the new film keeps mostly faithful to the last, albeit with an update on the horror value. I didn't find this film to be downright scary or anything but its very satisfying because its able to get so much from its cast and writers and makes for a pleasant experience. Although, the film has child actors do not mistake this for a children friendly film. Its completely adult and much more adult than the TV miniseries.Its quite obvious whether you have seen the film yet or not that there will be another film. Come on, you should know that the original miniseries is two parts with an adult portion where the kids grow up and get terrorized once again by Pennywise. If the writers, filmmaker, and clown stay the same, then I am game for the next chapter. Overall, its a great remake that benefits from being more modern and more mature. Watch It.8/10",8,6,13,8 September 2017
Hereditary," Hereditary (2018)
","Everyone's favorite production company (A24), comes back with a much anticipated horror film. I liked the trailer for this, despite feeling like it didn't reveal a whole lot. Also the film seemed to get a lot of early hype, and I'm not just talking about the parents and kids panicking when they accidentally showed this trailer at a screening of Peter Rabbit. The film earned high praise early on but of course I had to see this for myself. I've let the viewing sink in and I know that I really like this film despite it being full of questions.The film follows a family after the death of the grandma. The family initially seems to be at odds with one another. We soon find out that the daughter of the family, Charlie, was close with her grandmother. Charlie is the type who is quiet and has odd mannerisms including a clucking sound. Without saying much more, the family experiences tragedy and find out that things aren't what they seem as they feel like they are being haunted by an evil presence.It is so hard to talk about the plot without revealing something crazy. Just watch this film. Its not a conventional horror film, the film is almost entirely devoid of jump scares and does not really and scaring you in the moment. The film is more cerebral; its a psychological film that is engorging from beginning to end. Its shot extremely well, and is detail oriented. Ari Aster absolutely knocks it out of the park in his film debut. There are things and moments in this film that I still question, and I feel like the director leaves many clues and easter eggs throughout. This film demands a second watch.I don't see Toni Colette in many films but my god she is amazing in this. Absolutely portrays every emotion perfectly. You see the rage, depression, fear, and absolute terror all emoted on her face. Such great praise for her and Alex Wolff who was also excellent. Lets not forget Ann Dowd as well, she's always solid in everything she's in and does not disappoint here either. The performances really add to the aura of what you are seeing on screen.This film has some really memorable scenes. I don't get scared by horror films but this one really has scenes that are brilliant. I was even laughing hysterically at some parts and finding myself surprised by what transpires. I think everyone should try to see this and unpack what this film offers. I will say though, I thought the ending could have been better and feel like there are things in the film that demanded explanation. Its fine though, this is one of the best films of the year so far.8/10",8,22,45,12 June 2018
Detroit," Detroit (2017)
","I still haven't seen Near Dark, but have been really wanting to do so. I will say this though, Bigelow's Strange Days is amazing. In recent years Bigelow has shifted focus to more politically-war themed films. With Detroit, Bigelow brings attention to the Algiers Motel Incident which occurred during a race riot in Detroit. Her past two Academy Award nominated efforts made it seem like Detroit would be a contender this year. Overall, I am quite disappointed with this film and I'll tell you why.As mentioned earlier Detroit depicts the real life event at the Algiers Motel, where black men and two white women were rounded up and humiliated by cops because of gun shots fired towards police during a very heated riot. The film enlists the help of John Boyega, Will Poulter, Anthony Mackie, and an impressive Will Poulter. I did really enjoy seeing Hannah Murray in a film as well, she's a cutie. I thought Poulter was a perfect casting in this role. He impressed me, and now that I think about it his Pennywise from It may have been an interesting but successful casting if it panned out.The film mainly suffers from being too long. The incident itself, while interesting does not need to be padded. The events of the night are portrayed for far to long, and the aftermath itself loses steam fast. The performances are good but there's a real sense of just showing the story without portraying it in an impassioned way. Obviously the events of the film still resonate today and should have really rallied a reaction but the film just falls flat.I do like Bigelow as a filmmaker but she takes a misstep by recreating the events for this film. I don't expect this film to make any real splash awards season because its actually far from good. Poulter or maybe even Boyega may have an outside chance of a nomination but I don't see this film staying in memory for very long. Disappointed, but I know Bigelow will bounce back.6/10",6,1,3,1 December 2017
Rocketman," Rocketman (2019)
","Based on a true fantasy. I heard some great stuff about this film and it peaked my interest. I know that Dexter Fletcher filled in to direct the final weeks of Bohemian Rhapsody but for me this felt like his first true musical biopic I didn't like Bohemian Rhapsody all that much outside of the music and Rami Malek. I'm glad to say that Rockeman is substantially better. Its well acted, well curated, and is even in nature. Its something that's welcome as far as the quality of musician biopic's go.The film starts off with Elton John in therapy where he tells the story of how he got addicted to alcohol and drugs, primarily cocaine. We see the story of Elton's youth, originally known as Reginald and how he grew up in a loveless household. He goes far with his natural gift but the pain of his past and his current affairs drive him off the deep end. Still, the talented musicianship remains and the film shows the journey of the highs and lows of Sir Elton John's life.The film is a musical in nature, as characters burst into song spontaneously, throughout the film. Taron Egerton brings a surprisingly great performance as Elton and brings the bombastic nature and all the intricacies of John to screen. He is really good in this. The music, all sang by Egerton himself also shows how much work was put into this. Fletcher's film captures the magic of the music and the showman while also showing the dark stages of his life and the impact that substance abuse have on his well being.The film follows the biopic formula, yet it does so fairly uniquely with its presentation in musical format and its connecting imagery. Its a colorful film and does a lot in its run time. Its a good time to be had whether you are familiar with Elton's work or not. It'll probably be a long long time till we see another biopic about a musician that is actually competent. Rocketman most certainly exceeded my expectations. Its the best film of the new releases this week at the cinemas.7.5/10",7,0,2,2 June 2019
A Star Is Born," A Star is Born (2018)
","I know there have been multiple incarnations of A Star is Born but I've only seen the Judy Garland version. I didn't think it was anything amazing but I was game with a modern retelling of the basic story. This one was swimming around in production for a while and then we finally got Bradley Cooper starring and directing his first film ever. The more interesting aspect was Lady Gaga getting the lead role as well. I liked the trailers for this quite a bit and was hyped for it. Overall, its a good film not sure it matches the praise I read for it but its definitely a very solid film.The film is about an alcoholic singer songwriter and the relationship he sparks up with a waitress who moonlights as a singer at a drag bar. He realizes her talent in singing and songwriting and eventually brings her out to perform with him at one of his shows. She blows up, and then must deal with the fame and the failing relationship with her drunk partner, whose condition worsens each day. The film also enlists the talents of Sam Elliot and Dave Chappelle (although the later is a very brief appearance).First thing's first. The music in this film is very good. Its well thought out and you get the feel of a genuine and raw live performance each time you see the duo on stage. It does a good job of mimicking the life and work of two real musicians. This is definitely the best performance of both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's career. Gaga once again shows she has a natural talent for acting and singing and the role allows her to flourish in both. The film is also a good portrayal of mental health, the damaging effects addiction has on an individual, and its loved ones. Its somber but absolutely true. The cinematography is also excellent.I thought the film was long and absolutely felt its length. Its easy to get sidetracked and feel like parts in the final hour drag. It doesn't detract so much from the films quality because everything else is still really good. Music lovers and general film lovers will have a field day with this film. I would not be surprised at all if this film is up there in the mix for all the major Oscars of the year, although its still very early to tell.7.5/10",7,0,1,11 October 2018
Wind River," Wind River (2017)
","Taylor Sheridan really broke out with his script for Sicario. I'm not the biggest fan of the film although I admit its quite good. Then he wrote the script for Hell or High Water which felt like a country styled thriller that we'd see from the Coen Brothers. Here, he comes not only writing but this time directing Wind River. I didn't know much about the film before going into it. I have to say this is Sheridan's best work. Its so sharp, strong, thrilling, and horrific at the same time. I'm still in thought of what I've just seen. People really need to check this out.The film takes place in the Wind River reservation in Wyoming. In the freezing cold terrain a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Agent stumbles across the frozen dead body of an 18 year old Native American girl. Upon further investigation it is revealed that she had been sexually assaulted and died in the cold. With the help of an FBI special agent, the pair try to figure out what exactly occurred while trying to bring justice to all parties involved. The film is pretty much a modern but loose noir that becomes an intense barn burning thriller as it goes along.Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen work together (not for the first time), and both are quite excellent and very convincing in their roles. I LOVE Elizabeth Olsen and love that she took on a role where she gets to show off a bit of range. Wonderful in a role as a brace and committed agent who still can get distracted by her surroundings and let the harrowing details of the case get to her. Renner is just a badass, a great sharpshooter. One of the other highlights of the film is the locale setting of this. Absolutely heightens the experience.The film has disturbing moments (revelation of the case). Sheridan once again explores mystery by diving into the pure evil and the justice that comes with it. Tense shootouts, bloody moments, and a thrilling third act; Sheridan masters it all. Its really sharply written. I thought the film meandered a bit at the end but that's really the only thing I can pick out from an otherwise fun ride. This film didn't get a lot of buzz this year which is slightly outrageous.8/10",8,7,13,26 August 2017
Unbreakable," Unbreakable (2000)
","I saw this film many years ago and decided to check it out again. I re-watched a few of M. Night Shyamalan's films this year and just wanted to run through the very best of the lot. Having seen Split earlier in the year and learning of the sequel to Unbreakable coming out soon I think it was just time. I really love The Village and Signs from M. Night, in recent years his films have tanked but in the past he made some really solid work. Unbreakable isn't as good as those two mentioned earlier but its pretty great.The film is a superhero movie about a man who is unbreakable. He has super strength and radar to track criminals, and also can survive accidents without breaking a bone. On the other hand there is a man with a rare genetic disorder where his bones break very easily, he is aptly named Mr. Glass. Mr. Glass encounters David Dunn (the hero played by Bruce Willis) and lets him know about his powers. From there Dunn starts to realize his potential and what it means for him and his family. He also puts his powers into action and uses it to catch bad people who are committing crimes against humanity.This film is not perfect but its incredibly crafty and smart. Its such a subtle superhero film that really is well thought out. Having two opposite men who are on different ends of the spectrum, in terms of what their motivations are and their physical predispositions are is brilliant. M. Night was honestly a master of creating a gripping story with a twist in his early days, and this wasn't an exception. You get two really good performances from the two leads and also feel like the characters are quite strong and memorable. The film does delve into some scary bits, especially when Dunn finds out the crimes of some of the people he interacts with.This is no Village or Signs, or even Sixth Sense but Shyamalan reunites with Bruce Willis for quite an engaging effort that really is a tribute to comic books and the comic book structure. Its also got a wonderful score to boot. Its very easy to get lost in the film and I just love the way key plot points are drawn it and sucks you into the mood of the film. I would recommend checking this out because its one of the finer efforts from a director who was once great.7.5/10",7,0,1,17 May 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)
","I had a few initial worries about this film. I'm a giant Star Wars fan and even a bit of an apologist for some of the stuff that occurs in the prequels. I also greatly enjoyed The Force Awakens and think the film held up on a re-watch. Saying that, I was worried that having another Star War film a year after TFA may have been overkill. I was also worried about Felicity Jones being a lead. Inferno was a bad film and I thought Felicty Jones was not very good in it. I thought the film was in a good filmmaker's hands, as Gareth Edwards' Godzilla (while not without flaws) was an enjoyable blockbuster. My bare minimum for the film was to just be better than the previous prequels, a feat that shouldn't have been too hard. Now after seeing the film I can say that I am satisfied.This was my first IMAX 3D venture. I was unfamiliar with how IMAX 3D would look but it was amazing to see the characters pop out of the screen. The film immediately (without an opening scroll which was a bit disappointing) goes into who Jyn Erso really is, and her quest to find her father and recover plans to destroy the Death Star. Much like with The Force Awakens, you are introduced to a multitude of new characters and a new droid, K-2SO. K-2SO is a wonderful character, and its very obvious that he is the comic relief of the film. Its much needed to because its hard to rely on the other characters. Some of the other characters like Riz Ahmed's Bodhi Rook and Wen's Baze Malbus feel underdeveloped and its hard to get invested in them. I'll come out and say its hard to get invested in many of the characters as there isn't any emotional connection or dimensional aspect to a few of them. This even includes Diego Luna's Cassian. As opposed to Finn and Rey in The Force Awakens who you connect with instantly. I thought Felicity Jones for the most part did a solid job in a leading role, although I kind of cringed when she was trying to cry upon seeing a hologram of her dad. Its hard to criticize acting in the Star Wars films because come on, Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen were awful in the prequels and had some of the most awkward chemistry ever seen.The films strongest point is most certainly the battles. The land battle is the best seen since the one in The Empire Strikes Back. The flying space battles are relatively great as well. The digital effects look good, especially in a certain scene near the end. I feel like if I wasn't wearing 3D glasses I'd be able to take in the giant nature of the expansive battles but that's just something I'll have to look forward to when I re-watch the film. The score of the film is grandiose as you would expect in a Star Wars film. It does not disappoint.I think the best part of the film is, hands down, witnessing Darth Vader again. James Earl Jones returns to voice him. I'm not sure if its the case, but his costume model looked slightly different in the helmet but I might be wrong. His first scene is great and his battle scene is so memorable. Its nice to see an iconic character in film have a resurgence all these years later and still be so badass. Also don't even act like mentioning Vader is a spoiler; he's in the trailer.I think Rogue One felt fairly dark. Star Wars is generally pretty family friendly. And while there is violence and adult themes in these films, Rogue One had an air of bleakness and hopelessness. You know what will happen to these characters, its already written. That's why in the third act we get a real sense of it with the fate of some characters. However, that hopelessness immediately turns into hope and the film ends in an exciting and prospective way.Rogue One is not better than The Force Awakens for me. The Force Awakens was a cinema experience that was fun from start to finish. Rogue One is less show in a narrative sense and more business when it comes to the facts of the story and the technical aspects of warfare. Rogue One is still a great cinematic experience in the sense that the battles are still incredible to watch, and the film boasts a few moments that fans of the series will just love. Those moments bumped the films rating up a number for me.8/10",8,1,9,25 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel (2019)
","As we approach the release of Avengers: Endgame, The Marvel Cinematic Universe makes its final stop before that with Captain Marvel. Amazingly, 11 years into the series of films, we get the first female led film. I was fairly hyped for this picture; the trailers looked good and most importantly the film has a leading cat starring. No underestimating the importance of a feline hero. I read some reviews with people not liking this. I can't really speak for anyone but myself. I had a good time watching this. I think the film starts off a slow but then reaches its height and is a fun time.The film takes place in 1995, and follows an ex air force pilot named Vers/Carol Danvers. She is in he midst of an alien war between Kree's and Skrulls. She crash lands on earth and befriends Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. in following shape-shifting Skrulls. Danvers also possesses superhuman strength after an accident years prior. The film essentially shows off the start of Nick Fury as we know him and one of the earlier superhero's in this Marvel Cinematic timeline. Also, there's an amazing cat named Goose.Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck are definitely an interesting pick for this film. I've seen and really enjoyed Half Nelson from them but questioned how they would handle a big budget superhero film. I know there are complaints about the action in comparison with other MCU films. I found it sufficient. The effects used to show Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg when they were younger was absolutely incredible and seamless. I like the chemistry with Brie Larson and Sam Jackson, something I felt was a shining moment in this film.Brie is perfectly fine as Carol Danvers. She is super talented obviously and does the job here as well. As with other MCU films the film uses a sufficient amount of humor and intergalactic action to please the audience. We might have been spoiled by the recent entries in the MCU (Black Panther and Avengers Infinity War) but we cant always expect a fantastic Marvel entry. The film comes with flaws but was an entertaining watch. It also has linkage with other films and characters in the MCU so lookout for that.I had a great time with this and feel like its better than a good amount of Marvel films. I thought all around it hits the Marvel film formula checklist and though its not anything extraordinary, its a perfectly fine origin film about a hero that could be big in the war against Thanos. Yes, that hero is goose the cat. What an adorable little ball of fur. Now I am so geared up for Endgame, its so close and the hype is real.7.5/10",7,0,4,10 March 2019
Passengers," Passengers (2016)
","Two of Hollywood's current top stars finally come together in this sci-fi adventure from Morten Tyldum. Its not a name that rolls right off the tongue or is too familiar but I have seen his previous effort, The Imitation Game. While it was a technically well made biopic about an important man, it wasn't all that interesting. I wasn't too impressed with the trailers for Passengers as it looked like a cookie cutter sci-fi film coming in a time where these types of films are really popular.The film is basically what I had feared that it would be. First, let me talk about the positives. I had no problems with the effects in the film. I thought the space scenes looked good and the set and production design was excellent. The spaceship looked sleek, modern, and alluring. The score was also nice. Both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence work well together and put in good performances. I think Lawrence overacts in the really emotional moments but its fine because she's good elsewhere here.The film suffers from pauses and lagging for the first hour or so. Its repetitive at times ad just seems really inconsequential. Nothing goes on for a majority of the film and it drags a slight bit. I did not feel like the film really explored amazingly new ground. Films like Interstellar and Moon covered similar concepts and in a much better way. Its easy to question and scratch your head at some of the motivations of the characters (and androids). About an hour in I was really struggling to continue with the film but soldiered through.If you are a fan of Pratt or J-Law you may want to check this out. If you are like me and an avid sci-fi/space film fan you may be sorely disappointed by the generic and familiar nature of a film that should have really dazzled with the stakes that the film seemed to offer. Still, I guess you could find some enjoyment out of this film despite it being pretty flawed. Not every film is going to be a masterpiece, I just expected this film to offer something better and more engaging.6/10",6,3,6,24 February 2017
Us," Us (2019)
","Jordan Peele rocked the world when he made Get Out a few years back. A film that garnered major buzz and even made some waves at the Oscars. I've always been a big fan of Peele and loved Key and Peele. Like most I was very excited for Us. The trailers for the film made it look like a straight up twisted horror film from the mind of a very creative individual. I liked most parts of the film but feel slightly disappointed with other parts. I feel like there are ideas in the film that are not fully developed and could have used more work.The film is about a family that go to a vacation home. The matriarch of the family suffered trauma at a beach when she was younger and is hesitant to go there with her family. One night their home is broken into by a family, who they soon realize are their doppelgangers. These doppelgangers are more twisted versions of themselves with the intent to harm the family. The family try their best to survive while also figuring how something like this could happen. The film stars Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke, with Elisabeth Moss in a supporting role.The soundtrack of the film is good. Don't mind some head bopping to the Beach Boys and N.W.A. The film is shot very well. Peele has mastered a real thrilling suspense element to his work which keeps you engorged with what might happen next. I felt like the story and themes of the film are undercooked which lead to a lower rating for me. Its acted extremely well by Lupita and is an interesting concept that needed more explanation than what was given. You can tell Peele has a creativity and a penchant for this genre but just felt like the script and main ideas could have been fine tuned.This will offer a decent theater experience but doesn't resonate as well as Get Out did. Social class themes are examined in this film, much like race was in Get Out but Us doesn't hit the profound note that Get Out did. Its never really scary but has thrilling and comedic moments which make it a fun time at the cinema. I just wanted more from this. It's a film that had the potential to be outstanding but falls short despite being a fairly pleasing experience.6.5/10",7,1,4,23 March 2019
Knives Out," Knives Out (2019)
","A lot of people had issues with Star Wars: The Last Jedi but I absolutely loved it. Then again, I've rated Rian Johnson since he came onto the scene with Brick and later followed up with a smart science fiction thriller in Looper. Knives Out by trailer didn't look lik anything amazing although a 'whodunnit?' is always fun. Reviews seemed very positive and it is all warranted. This one comes with a unique way of solving the crime and its humor and ensemble cast make for an entertaining watch.
The film is about the death of a very wealthy novelist. Initially, his death is deemed to be a suicide but a renown detective with a bizarre southern accent named Benoit Blanc is suspicious and thinks that the man was murdered by his family. His family members appear to be hiding more than they seem and clues come one by one. However, its not a simple case of murder and the circumstances leading to the death are very unique and no as forward as it seems. Interestingly enough, Ana de Armas takes a huge role here as a lead character.
I think the film should be commended for its storytelling. Its not like other films where you have to wait till the end to make your decision on who the culprit was. In a way the film is more transparent than that but also still very elusive. The hallmark of a good film is how its just engaging throughout through a sharply written script that thrives on its humor and call backs to films of the past in the same genre. I loved seeing de Armas in a lead role. Wanted to see a lot more of her ever since Knock Knock. Daniel Craig also turns in a memorable performance.
This is definitely worth a watch also for its truly great ensemble cast. None of the family are particularly likeable and its supposed to be that way. Whatever grudges you may have had against Johnson for The Last Jedi should be freshly bowled over because Knives Out is a smartly entertaining film that is capping of a rather great year in film. Impressive stuff.

Aquaman," Aquaman (2018)
","After the release of Justice League I wasn't optimistic about anything in the DC Extended Universe, not named Wonder Woman. I thought Aquaman was just going to be terrible and unnecessary in a universe that seemed to be in disarray. I was kind of warming up to it with the new trailers released and the fact that a competent filmmaker in James Wan. I think this is an fairly entertaining entry in the DC Universe and definitely the second best film after Wonder Woman.The film follows the story of Arthur Curry, who is an heir to an underwater kingdom that his half brother is trying to take control of. The film goes into the details of Curry's past and shows how Aquaman eventually became the hero he is today. In this film Aquaman must find a powerful trident and stop a war that threatens his people and all of Earth. The film stars Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, and Patrick Wilson.Wan reunites with a reliable name in Wilson who plays Ocean Master. Both him and Black Manta feel like generic villains as is the case with a lot of superhero films, its also tough to establish a villain with the general unfamiliarity with the Aquaman comics for the general masses. You can tell the film has a big budget as it is exquisite in its underworld fantastical elements and all the action and effects that go along with it.The film isn't anything groundbreaking when it comes to superhero films and its quite cheesy in dialogue and comedic nature. It still works for the most part and is a refreshing change in light, tone, and color in this universe. Its not exactly a huge endorsement as to why the DCEU should continue to exist, but it shows that under the right guidance it can work better than most previously anticipated.7/10",6,5,8,25 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2 (2018)
","Like many others, I did enjoy Deadpool when it came out a few years back. it was a refreshing and very self aware film that wasn't afraid to break the fourth wall and really go for it. Add to that that it was one of the few R-rated comic book/superhero films, which ultimately made for a fun time. Now after the dust settles from Avengers: Infinity War, Deadpool 2 comes out and immediately from the trailers you can tell its going for its referential and aware humor. Sequels do not always work but I think in this films case it comes close to the original.The film picks up after the events of the first film, but this time there is a young mutant named Russell Collins who Deadpool gets intertwined with. A time traveling soldier named Cable (very reminiscent of a Terminator) comes back in time to try to kill Collins. Deadpool is also trying to recruit a group of superheroes to come together to stop cable, and he wants to call them the X-Force. The film keeps many of the characters from the first film while adding new faces, the most worthy addition being Domino (played by Zazie Beetz).If you don't like the first Deadpool you won't like this one. Its more of the same. There is high paced and every present action scenes, lot of bloody and gory scenes, foul language, and clever humor and a light hearted comedic attitude throughout. The film makes plenty of references to film tropes and other super hero films (as expected). I think the addition of David Leitch as director was great. The action scenes are excellent to watch, and Leitch is no stranger to style when it comes to fight scenes, having helmed Atomic Blonde and John Wick previously.The story may be somewhat predictable, but the character interactions, the humor and the fast paced action make the film a fun ride. One cannot deny the charm that Ryan Reynolds brings to the Deadpool character, its a high point of the film. I also loved Zazie Beetz as Domino, love her in Atlanta. There is plenty going on and while the film could easily become sappy, tired, or cheesy, it doesn't really wander into that territory. I didn't like the very ending of the film and I feel like it prolongs a problem I see in these recent crop of super hero films.I enjoyed the first Deadpool but feel like the sequel is just as good, if not slightly better. This film has a much better villain and the supporting characters are utilized better. Its references are just as smart as the first, and this franchise and its lead character haven't really lost a bit, though it runs the risk of doing that with future installments. Deadpool 2 meets expectations.7.5/10",8,2,5,19 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor: Ragnarok (2017)
","Admittedly, I'm not really a fan of the Thor films. I like Chris Hemsworth as Thor and an Avenger, but the films never drew my interest. Trailers for this looked good as it seemed to be more concerned with an adventurous and humorous time. Which is why Taika Waititi coming on board was a good move. What We Do in the Shadows is absolutely hilarious, and him in the MCU could have provided fun for a franchise that didn't have much of it previously. All in all, I've got to say this film is such a good time.This film takes place after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron and around the same time as Captain America: Civil War. Asgard is under siege by a new threat, a menacing and powerful sibling of Thor named Hela. Along the way Thor is enslaved on a planet where gladiator type battles occur and he tries to get Hulk and a bounty hunter named Valkyrie to band with him to save Asgard. Oh yeah, and we've got more Thor and Loki goodness too.The film actually looks gorgeous in the theaters. The scenes with Asgard especially. The choreographed fights are all excellent. The soundtrack (with Led Zeppelin's thunderous Immigrant Song) make the action a sonic and visual feat. The film is so much fun. There are jokes everywhere, many at the expense of Thor himself. It all works though. These films are ridiculous, and we should be able to laugh at it more often. Its probably the most light hearted entry in the MCU yet. Its probably the most re-watchable entry in this Universe because of that.Character development is quite sufficient at all ends. Thor is hammerless without most of the film but taps the inspiration of Odin to enable his true godly power. Loki is still conniving and narcissistic but you can't help but love it. Hulk isn't one of my favorite Avengers but even he is a welcome part of all the screen time he gets. Cate Blanchett is obviously a phenomenal actress but I was quite curious to see her in a superhero film. She's absolutely great. One of the most memorable villains in the MCU.Let's also not forget Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster. The film fires at all fronts. It's miles and away the best Thor film made, and gives Captain America: Civil War a real run for its money. Ragnarok has vastly now improved the Thor films which is what I was hoping for. Phase 3 is in full swing going into Infinity War. There are so many elements and heroes in this Marvel Universe but I'm excited to see what can be don with it all.8.5/10",8,2,7,4 November 2017
Zodiac," Zodiac
","People will point to Se7en or Panic Room as David Fincher's best work, but I like to think Zodiac is his magnum opus. I'm fascinated with the Zodiac killer, and the string of terror he brought in his time. Its riveting, and I think the film portrays many of the real life events very accurately. Fincher's other films are great, but none encompass the spectrum that Zodiac does. Zodiac works as a period piece, police drama, a newspaper drama (if that's even a subdivision), and a thriller. I need to get around to reading Robert Graymsith's book. Feel like the film kind of flew under the radar in 2007, it unfortunately bombed in the box office and I think it deserved at least a Best Picture/Director nod at the Oscars. Its a long film but completely engrossing, which can't be said for every lengthy film these days.",9,1,1,16 October 2014
Cloverfield," Amazing film!
","Cloverfield is a true theater experience. I have never had so much fun watching a film in theaters. I know that this film was generally over hyped, but the truth is I didn't feel let down in the slightest bit. In fact, I feel I got more than I bargained for. The sound and action in the film are amazing, a perfect blend of horror, thrill, and even comedy. And the fact that it was taped through an ordinary camera makes it so real and exciting at the same time. You feel like you are in the film watching what goes down. The monster is awesome, and the film is damn good, I recommend this film to everyone.go watch it in theaters!",10,2,10,21 January 2008
Ready Player One," Ready Player One (2018)
","Lets face it, Steven Spielberg has been streaky in the past few years. I absolutely love some of his earlier stuff. Jaws, Jurassic Park, E.T., are just some of the titles that I love from him. Even some of the work from the 90's like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are excellent. I did like his last effort (The Post) which was a solid politically based news drama. I wasn't overly impressed with the marketing or trailers for Ready Player One, but Spielberg's name being attached meant I was curious. At the very least I expected to ride that nostalgia wave that I feel a lot of others wanted to experience as well.The film is set in the year 2045. The world is vastly different and everyone is immersed in a virtual world named the OASIS. The protagonist Wade uses his virtual character and enlists the help of a team to find a hidden easter egg in the OASIS. The creator of the OASIS has hidden three keys that lead to the egg and the one who completes the challenges to earn the egg will take over the creator's fortune and also control the virtual reality world. The CEO of a corporation named IOI is attempting to gain control of the egg himself, thwarting Wade's quest.This has to be one of Steven Spielberg's most ambitious and toughest films to make. The film is heavily computer animated as expected, and there is so much on screen. There are plenty of references to pop culture of the past. You will see movie and video game references everywhere; you are bound to miss many of them because some come and go quick. Licensing to use these characters must have been hell but it was done nonetheless. Visually the film is nice, some of the computer animation might be distracting but its still fun to look at.I do think the film is overlong and drags quite a bit in the third act. I know the film is following a literary work so its hard to criticize some of the plot holes or advancement of the plot. I don't feel like the side characters were as fleshed out as they could have been. The film gets too busy making references and delivering action that it kind of loses its heart. I did however really enjoy the entire segment with The Shining, fairly brilliant stuff.I was also disappointed with the soundtrack. I wanted more 80s nostalgia in term of music. For example, some of the songs used in the trailers could have been utilized but isn't done so. The film isn't always smart and some of the pop culture references feel ham fisted and tacked on but I feel like the film was better than I thought it would be. I'm actually pretty infatuated with Olivia Cooke at the moment. She's quite a talented actress having recently seen her in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, and Thoroughbreds. I want to see her in everything.This film isn't touching some of Steven Spielberg's very best but its a better film than what we've been seeing recently from the filmmaker. its certainly a better film than The BFG and War Horse. Overall, visually it provides actions and a lot of references but suffers a bit as the film wears on. Still, its an entertaining watch, which is really all I was asking for from Ready Player One.6.5/10",7,2,6,1 April 2018
"I, Tonya"," I, Tonya (2017)
","I think this film may have had the best trailer of 2017. I saw it and knew instantly how badly I wanted to see it. I've never been a fan of Margot Robbie and her previous acting efforts but this looked like her awakening and where she would be proving me wrong. I believe it, she's quite sensational in this film. Her dedication to her role shows but really everyone involved has done very well. Craig Gillespie has his first real winner with I, Tonya.I, Tonya is a biographical picture about famed and disgraced figure skater, Tonya Harding. Tonya was pushed onto the rink by her abusive mother at a very young age and despite the abuse becomes a very talented ice skater. The cycle of abuse continues with her abusive husband but she tries to bear through and succeed. Everyone seems to be against her but her talent is hard to deny. The film also goes into the famed attack on fellow ice skater Nancy Kerrigan and the aftermath of the incident.The film is sort of told from a mockumentary perspective as if key characters are being interviewed. The film also utilizes breaking the fourth wall where characters in a scene would talk to the audience. I thought this was interesting and separates itself from being a standard biopic and gives this film a real comedic depth. The soundtrack is catchy and literally every performance in this film makes for a very engaging time. I didn't even recognize the chameleon Bobby Cannavale until the credits rolled.Some wonder why the film was made but it kind of helps you identify with Tonya. She suffered physical and psychological abuse from both her foul mouthed mother and her rage filled husband. Her hands may not be completely clean in what happens to Nancy Kerrigan, but she is also just a victim of circumstances. Vastly talented, but just short of reaching her pinnacle due to outside factors and her image and attitude. The film isn't perfect but its vastly entertaining and could be giving Margot Robbie and Allison Janney Oscar nominations. I'm going to let this sink in and I'm sure its going to be something I go back to.7.5/10",8,133,154,7 December 2017
Molly's Game," Molly's Game (2017)
","I'm a giant fan of Aaron Sorkin as a screenwriter. I loved The Social Network, who knew a film about Facebook of all things could be so well written. I also loved his work on Steve Jobs, the sharp writing and focusing on three key points in Jobs' life just made for such an entertaining watch. I don't know anything about poker, but just seeing a combination of Sorkin and Jessica Chastain (who I adore) was enough to get me hyped for this.The film is based on the life of Molly Bloom, a former skier who finds herself getting an in with Hollywood celebrities, famous athletes and other high rollers in games of high stakes poker. After spending years of learning the game she branches out and begins hosting and soon the games start involving the mob and law enforcement gets involved and she is eventually arrested. The film is primarily told from Molly's perspective and also stars Idris Elba as Molly's attorney.Jessica Chastain is one of my favorite actresses. She's absolutely gorgeous and is so talented. I always feel like she comes close to winning an Academy Award but doesn't quite reach the pinnacle. She's unsurprisingly superb in Molly's Game, it might be her very best. She nails a completely character driven performance. The running length is long (clocking in at 140 minutes) but for me time kind of flew by because I was so into Molly's world. The film brings style and enough substance for me to really take a caring for Molly and what happened in her life.This film is not about a character finding love, no none of that crap here. We have a well written biography of a person who got entangled with the wrong group and you want to see her find her way out. Sorkin's directional debut works so well for me. The world of poker becomes accessible for know nothings like me because Sorkin breaks down everything so well, while showing us the glitz and fast pace of the gaming world. I'm happy with Sorkin's finished product. It'll be a tough year for her as always but I'd love for Chastain to win the big awards for this.7.5/10",7,2,7,25 December 2017
Moana," Moana (2016)
","If you know me well enough you would know that I'm very critical of animated films. I think a lot of them miss the mark and can only remain interesting for children. A good animated feature is inclusive of a widespread audience and can remain smart and engaging will offering fun and crafty animation. Moana is not something I was looking forward to, as on paper it didn't look like it was going to leave much of an impression on me. It's safe to say that I'm surprised that this film was honestly pretty good.The first thing that I think deserves praise is the music. Nearly every song is excellent, catchy, and just so full of life. It's hard not to sing along to the music. This isn't exactly something I can say for a lot of animated films. The more technical aspect of the film is great. The colors are very vibrant and the animation is vivid and expansive (just like the vast ocean the heroes sail). Some of the action is eye-popping and very striking, especially the battle with the lava demon, Te Ka. Auli'i Cravalho is a relative newcomer who does a very good job of bringing Moana to life. She will probably have many more voice acting roles in the future.I also think the film is a good look into a culture that many people won't be familiar with. I've noticed that Disney is really trying to focus on some minority groups in the past few years and this is perfectly good for fresh inspiration. In the case of Moana, this provided for an interesting and unfamiliar setting and story, which adds to the films overall appeal. I'm well aware of the cultural criticisms this film received for the portrayal of Maui and the lack of heroine goddesses. However, its good to leave some criticisms at the door. If you look hard enough a criticism can be found for anything and its unnecessary for a film that means well.The film has its typical Disney clichés. You have the 'chosen' hero who is unsure of themselves. You have the relationship with a buddy that is at first strained but then leads to the characters liking each other. There is a falling out and reunion with the hero discovering their ability. The film treads familiar Disney ground. Its not a terrible thing and kids won't really give a damn about it. Its not a flawless film, at its core its a familiar formula but I think the cultural aspect and imaginative visuals put a good balance.I think Kubo and the Two Strings was far and away the best animated film of the year and proved why Laika are ahead of the curve. I'd say Moana is better than some of its animated counterparts in the year, such as Zootopia and Finding Dory. I still long for the days of 90s Disney films but this effort shows that they are still trying at least. If for nothing else, sit back and enjoy the excellent music and visuals in the film.7.5/10",7,6,14,23 January 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)
","At this point its almost impossible to deny that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a money making vehicle. While I'm not overly fond of some of the MCU films, others are just a complete blast. I think we are in Phase 3 of the MCU now with this film. Its the second reboot of Spider-Man after The Amazing Spider-Man films failed (I'd say pretty miserably as well). The main concern for this one was having to re-hash the same type of introduction once again. Luckily having the character be a part of Captain America: Civil War was a great way of just taking off in a good place with the Spider-Man character.The film shows a young Peter Parker in high school and is able to focus on all aspects of his superhero and personal life. On one hand he likes a girl in his school named Liz and wants to go out with her. On the other hand, Peter has to get used to his new role and uncovers a dangerous plot by the Vulture (played by Michael Keaton). And lastly, Parker is also trying to impress Tony Stark/Iron Man and wants to help advance his role with The Avengers despite getting himself into trouble many times.Tom Holland works very well as a young and exuberant teenage Peter Parker. He has the right amount of charm to make the character work. There's plenty of humor in the film as is common with MCU films. Keaton (who seems to like playing winged figures) is pretty great as Vulture. He has the skill to bring the right amount of menace to the character. A strength of this film is not having to retrace an origin story that has been done to death. We were luckily able to just skip over Uncle Ben's death, Peter getting bitten by the spider and all that jazz. This was a great idea. The film was able to just move right into not only getting us acclimated with the character but also push forward his relationship with Iron Man and the Avengers.The inevitable question comes. How does this rate among the other Spider-Man films? I think Homecoming is miles better than the awful Amazing Spider-Man films. Its also better than Spider-Man 3, but I think it falls just short of the original two Tobey Maguire films. Through no real fault of its own. Its a long film for sure but does just right of getting the character back on track for the future of the MCU. Its harmless fun.8/10",8,3,7,27 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Suicide Squad (2016)
","With the Bluray of this film recently released, I decided to give the extended edition a rewatch. My initial thoughts about this film were not great as I thought a lot of the film was a mess. After rewatching the film again, my opinion of the film has not changed all that much. Be warned that this film will have potential spoilers and you should not read on if you don't want parts of the film spoiled.I wouldn't say I'm a huge comic book fan but I do prefer DC to Marvel. I'm mostly a Wonder Woman fan but I want to see Batman films done right as well. While I wasn't a giant detractor of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the film could certainly have been better. I hold out hope that the Justice League film and Wonder Woman film can lift the DC Universe because Suicide Squad sure as hell did not.The first problem I had with the film was the exposition of the squad's back story. Exposition is okay in doses and if its done correctly. This film has an awkward set up of it at a restaurant. The editing throughout the film is frenetic and erratic but its at its worst during the back stories. Also the character exposition is uneven. Deadshot and Harley Quinn get the most time. Its understandable because they are the main faces of the squad but its hard to really know the motivations or anything about the other characters when they have virtually no backstory or interesting element. Why did Captain Boomerang carry a pink unicorn around? Characters like Katana and Killer Croc are barely developed at all. Killer Croc seemed like a walking stereotype with bad lines. Characters are just thrown into this film, Slipknot was so useless and ultimately pointless. A lot of things felt pointless.Initially I thought Will Smith would Will Smith the hell out of this film but he did alright. I am not a fan of Margot Robbie at all but apparently she played a Harley Quinn that was faithful to the comics. Fair enough. I cringed at many 9nearly all) of her lines but maybe that was more a character thing more than a script issue. There is plenty of bad dialogue going around in the film. A lot of it is awkward. Viola Davis is a great Amanda Waller; she always performs well. I am not that big on Jai Courtney in other films but honestly he was alright in this and had a few good moments. I didn't have a problem with Jared Leto's Joker as many others did but I think their criticisms are valid. Heath Ledger's Joker was phenomenal and will never be duplicated, so I applaud Leto for putting a different spin on the role and trying to make it work.Plot progression is uneventful (for lack of a better word). The squad get assembled literally walk a few streets in the night and then they are at the villains location. Its like nothing happened except flashbacks and bits of action here and there. The middle section suffers from a few boring stretches. The villain(s) are not memorable and look too CG'ed. The flashbacks in real time during the boss battle was annoying too. I'm surprised at how bad this is because David Ayer is better than this. Fury and End of Watch were great and gritty war dramas and cop dramas respectively. He's also a good writer so I don't know what went wrong here. Was it the studio involvement that caused this film to be such a mess? This was such a disappointment for DC. The extended scenes don't add enough to make the film a little better. The Diablo reveal bothered me. He burns down the house with his family in it and then in the final battle we see him morph into a fire demon or something. So random and convenient. I would have shown him morph into the demon back in the house when he burned it down, like show a shadow on the wall of it happened just to foreshadow the real monster within him. Did I talk about the soundtrack yet? Yes its a collection of great songs but they are so randomly placed in the film and do not fit the tone of the film at all. The film struggles to really find a tone anyways.I still think this film is a mess and kind of regret buying the Bluray. I may end up selling it because I really don't think it was worth the money or the rewatch. DC better get their act together and deliver on Wonder Woman, that film NEEDS to be good.5/10",5,1,2,16 December 2016
Doctor Strange," Doctor Strange (2016)
","Its no secret that Marvel is a money making machine. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has grossed billions of dollars and remains a force every year. Overall, I think the franchise has been very successful in bringing comic book heroes to life through origin stories and combining the heroes for action epics. Marvel's latest installment was introducing the masses to Doctor Strange. I wasn't very familiar with the character so I was cautiously optimistic going into this one.The films stars Benedict Cumberbatch in the titular role. Benedict is a great performer and I think he's always remarkable in what he is in. Doctor Strange is about a arrogant but precisely successful neurosurgeon who gets in a life changing car crash that messes up hi hands. Strange searches far and wide for a way to get his hands working again. he travels to Nepal and is introduced to a fantastically magical world of sorcery where he can do more with his mind and alter reality, time, and the world from harnessing the power within.First off, the effects in this film are great. Its immensely psychedelic and extremely graphically busy. The skyline is constantly shifting and worlds are bending and all of it looks up to par. It was reminiscent of some of the sequences seen in Inception. The fight scenes in the film also do not disappoint. Its got what it needs to keep thrill seekers engaged. Marvel also gathers a very talented cast to add to its never ending list of A-listers involved in the MCU. Mads Mikkelsen is a brilliant performer, although he's a bit of a shallow villain in this.The film has too much going on in concepts. A person's soul? can come out of their body, there is a giant demon thing that's trying to destroy the world, there are shortcuts that lead to major cities, buildings can be moved, there is a mirror reality, a moving cape, fireballs, time can be put on a loop its insane how many things happen in this film. Its not that its hard to follow, its just that the film becomes conceptually ugly the longer it goes. It doesn't feel like other Marvel films as the world that is created isn't very interesting and feels bland despite all the visuals involved.Cumberbatch plays a great Doctor Strange. He's an egotistical guy who becomes humbled and is yet witty and remains flawed. He's a welcome addition to the Marvel Universe, I assume he will be a part of the next Avengers film. Its just that this origin film doesn't really stand out as you are just thrown into the world of sorcery and just have to accept what is going on. Its an admirable effort but pales in comparison to some of the other heroes in the MCU. There is still room for improvement and I'm curious to see where this goes.6.5/10",7,1,2,29 January 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri (2017)
","One minute into the film and I knew I was into something special. I really rate the work of Martin McDonagh. Both In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths are excellent. When I heard about this film and read the premise I felt like this could be something that would make award season waves. The film has got a stellar cast to both and does a wonderful mix of comedy and drama to drive home a piece of film that is one of the strongest of the year thus far.The film follows a lady who rents out three billboards outside of Ebbing, Missouri, which point fingers at the local officer Chief Willoughby, for not solving the death and rape of her teenage daughter. These ads become controversial as the chief is a beloved figure of the community and people start having mixed but strong reactions to the billboards. There is a scramble to figure out the results of the case, and the main characters all have life changing consequences of being involved.This has to be the strongest Frances McDormand performance I have ever seen. She's always great but this was a total embodiment of a determined and strong willed mother who perseveres, despite knowing most of the town can't stand her guts. Woody Harrelson is typically good and we once again get a great Sam Rockwell showing once again showing how underrated he is. You become engulfed into the film and wrapped into everything that occurs.The film has its funny moments but it also is heavy handed and deals with a devastating loss. The film remains somewhat unpredictable and while the end is a bit open ended and brings more questions than answers, it doesn't detract from a strong written work that was satisfying to see at the tail end of the year.7.5/10",7,3,5,2 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)
","One of the most beloved film franchises of all time ends its epic nine film, triple trilogy 'Skywalker Saga' with this latest installment. I might be a bit of a Star Wars apologist as I have found enjoyment in each and every installment in the film franchise. Yes, that does include the George Lucas prequel trilogy. The film series has been responsible for so many great moments that will stand in memory as time goes on. The sequel films have done well in the box office, despite being criticized by many fans. I've had no real issues with the films so I was hyped for Rise. The time has come for Rise.
The film continues after the events of The Last Jedi. To summarize, the opening scroll: Emperor Palpatine is actually alive, having survived the events of Return of the Jedi. Kylo Ren attempts to seek Palpatine and finds himself butting heads with Rey who is still under Jedi training. Things come to a head on all fronts and secrets come to life as Rey starts to understand her origins, purpose, and must work to find hope and the strength within herself. Most of the regular cast return for this final installment, including Billy Dee Williams returning as Lando Calrissian.
I felt a bit of an air of disappointment watching this film. This is not a bad film and serves its purpose of closing the Skywalker saga but I was just hoping for something much more epic and grand in terms of plot and story execution. I feel like big reveals and important plot moments aren't done with enough weight and I think things could have been done differently. I feel like for the world this franchise has built for itself, the film doesn't use its surroundings as much as it should with this. I was just expecting larger scale and something more worth the journey we have come through so far.
With that out of the way, I'll say the film is well acted. There's solid fan service for the people who have tuned in all these years and loved the feeling of hope from the first three films. The effects and fight scenes look great. Technically, its just as good visually and sonically as any of the best of this franchise. Definitely, worth a watch in a high quality format at the cinemas. I just feel like moments that are meant to be big and awe inspiring come off as cheap and derivative with this film.
I'd rank Rise under both Last Jedi, The Force Awakens, and the original trilogy. Its on par with and maybe slightly better than Revenge of the Sith for me. By no means a bad film and I think fans will get their money worth. I just wanted the film to be something more than just a nostalgic reminder of why the series is special in the first place. With that said, I am glad for this sequel trilogy which is reinvigorated this franchise and created a lot of magical moments in this Star Wars universe.7/10",7,2,10,21 December 2019
Lion," An emotional, wonderful, experience
","The main reason I wanted to see this badly was because of Rooney Mara. I love her to death but she's honestly nowhere near any of the top reasons why I enjoyed this. I don't think this film will be for everybody because it is meant to be emotional and can seem like award season bait. I thoroughly enjoyed it though. Much more than I thought I would. This is basically a much better version of Slumdog Millionaire. Slumdog is honestly a bit of a mess, and doesn't feel realistic. This (obviously based on a true story) is more or less a rags to riches story as well that is set in India and then shifts to Australia. The lead character lives in poverty with his mother and siblings and gets separated one night when he falls asleep on a train. He travels to areas in Calcutta where he struggles to understand Bengali and does not remember enough details to get home. He eventually ends up being adapted and has a successful life but then longs to find his family. It might be from being fresh out of the theater but I was quite emotionally attached to the protagonists quest to find his family. There are things that could be improved from a storytelling perspective, especially with the lack of focus on the adopted brother and his relationship with Nicole Kidman's character. I'll let it slide though because it was a fulfilling experience watching this film. All the actors in this film put in strong performances I know this might not get a lot of Award season love but I hope it at least gets nominated for Best Picture, and Best Adapted Screenplay.",8,3,8,5 December 2016
The Lost City of Z," The Lost Ciity of Z (2017)
","This film kind of crept on me but when I found out what it was about, I was interested. The expedition and mysterious disappearance of Percy Fawcett was curious upon reading about it, and I wanted to check out and learn more about his life leading up to that. I really liked The Immigrant by James Gray, especially because of a stellar showing by a very talented Marion Cotillard. I didn't expect sensational performances here (not a big fan of Charlie Hunnam based on what I've seen). I've heard critics rave about this film but I was feeling 'eh' about what I saw.As mentioned earlier the film is about the life of Percy Fawcett, starting off with his early expeditions and gradual progression and obsession with a lost city of 'Z' that he has heard of from a local. The film progresses and portrays different moments of his life, leading up to his final expedition where he disappeared with his son. The film has some really great looking scenes. The sunsets, the jungles and the aerial views look fantastic. The scene with the dark jungle and river with lights is absolutely gorgeous.While the film often looked beautiful, I felt like the writing of the film wasn't always sharp. With a biopic (especially one with a larger scope) its important to avoid skipping over crucial periods. This film jumps forward quite a bit so you kind of lose a bit of development and intrigue in what goes on. The film is overlong, which isn't exactly a problem if the film remains engaging throughout but that is not what happens in this case. The film needed a bit more urgency and you could tell that the film was padded.I haven't seen Hunnam in Sons of Anarchy but I have never been impressed with him in film. Its the same here. He lacks charisma and just seems to be a straight laced man that's going through the motions. In contrast, Siena Miller was excellent, very underrated performer. This is also a cool look into seeing future Spider-Man, Tom Holland. Even Robert Pattinson was decent. I'm not sold on Hunnam as a leading man, which is why I have no urgency to check out the new King Arthur film.I thought the final expedition and the re-imagining of it was strong and evoking. I wish that could be stated for the rest of the acts of the film. I was hoping to get a lot more out of this film. Its not bad but its just not something that fulfilled its potential. There's a certain something to the pictures of James Gray though; an alluring element. I'd still be interested to see what he can do in the future.6.5/10",7,0,3,28 June 2017
Baby Driver," Baby Driver (2017)
","I'm not the biggest Edgar Wright fan but man, I saw the trailer for this and I knew I had to see this as soon as I could. Everything about it seemed like a good time. I like the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, each film is funny and solid. I absolutely loathed Scott Pilgrim vs The World though and thought it was terrible. I was hoping for the best Wright ever made with Baby Driver and its pretty nice to say I think we are there with this film. I had pretty high hopes and have to say while the film isn't perfect and struggles a bit at the end its still a satisfying ride.The film follows a quiet but expert heist driver named Baby, and his toils in life which include finding love and the high risk/high reward lifestyle he lives as a getaway driver. Baby is constantly listening to music on different iPods to drown out the sound of tinnitus he developed during a traumatic childhood car accident which killed his parents. I really loved the interactions between Baby (Elgort) and Debora (James). I loved Lily James in Cinderella but I love her even more as the innocent waitress in love here. Side note, but holy cow she really looks like prime Shelly Johnson from Twin Peaks in this.I have to say Edgar Wright puts a wonderful spin on a heist film. Unlike his previous films, the film is really light on comedy and is solely action and style. Its great though. The car weaving scenes are very fun to watch, action scenes edited quite well. As with previous bank heist films the action brings it either with the guns or the frenetic car chases. I have yet to really like Ansel Elgort in something, but this has to be the film that's going to make him a star. I love the characters in this film. Spacey works so well as the leading mastermind behind the heists. Jon Hamm in a villainous role works just as well as Jamie Foxx as Bats. Eiza González is new to me but wow is she such a gorgeous actress, I may actually take up the From Dusk Till Dawn series now.The best touch in the creation of this film is the ever present soundtrack. Almost every part of the film is accompanied by Baby's iPod song. Its fantastically eclectic and does well to keep pace with the film and accompany different moods and themes as the film progresses. Things get a little messy near the end but I think Edgar Wright is somehow still able to keep it coherent and crazy till the end. This is the type of film that needs a second watch. Its possible that it will go down in in rating on a re-watch. However, its also equally possible for this to enter a personal cult status with another viewing. I'd say Edgar Wright did very well with this one.8/10",8,15,28,2 July 2017
Justice League," Justice League (2017)
","I was of the camp that thought Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, wasn't good but wasn't terrible either. With Wonder Woman coming out earlier this year and being a very fun time, you would have hoped the DC Extended Universe would get on track and continue to impress with Justice League. Warning signs were that the film somehow managed to look worse with every new trailer but I gave the film the benefit of the doubt. Yeah, this thing sucks.An ancient super being named Steppenwolf is trying to collect mother boxes to destroy the Earth and its up to a group of superheroes to band and unite to contain the threat. Batman and Wonder Woman attempt to recruit a hero of the sea (Aquaman), a cybernetically reconstructed former athlete (Cyborg), and an awkward kid who is very, very fast (Flash). Oh yeah, worst keep secret ever as well they also attempt to revive the recently fallen Superman.Here are some of the positives. I didn't have any problems with any of the casting choices. I obviously love Gadot as Wonder Woman, as she fully embodies the character. Affleck as Batman is solid. Momoa has a bad ass warrior look that works for Aquaman, and the comedic timing of Ezra Miller as Flash works. Actually Flash's fresh humor in this DCEU effort is actually the other strong point of this film. You would think that this film would be able to do a decent job of uniting DC's most popular characters but it really doesn't do a satisfying job of it.Justice League is one of the most expensive films ever made. Its hard to believe because the graphics look choppy and messy. Its almost as if parts of the graphics look like they were taken out of a video game. The battles also look fake because they are over done with graphics and it really looks ugly. Steppenwolf is a very generic villain, looks too computerized and isn't built well at all. The dialogue is horrendous sometimes. Some of the humor (mostly from Flash) works but the other moment's fall so flat. In contrast to BVS, Ben Affleck looked like he was just going through the motions.The film had a shorter running length than expected but it still felt too long. The exposition of some characters feels wasted at times, and other times you feel like they spend the wrong moments trying to just throw the characters in. It could have used much better writing. There were times were I was bored out of my mind. The action scenes are fairly grand but nothing epic (compare that to what we get in Thor: Ragnarok). I really back Snyder leaving the DCEU because this is a straight second misfire for him. It's unfortunate to say I have no interest in any film in this Universe aside from Wonder Woman 2.5/10",5,3,6,18 November 2017
Split," Split (2017)
","I was once a fan of M Night Shyamalan. I absolutely love The Village and Signs and feel he was on a fantastic creative run at one point. That ended when he made The Happening and then even worse, The Last Airbender. I thought The Visit was a nice reminder that he could bring forth an entertainingly thrilling film. I was hoping Split would give me the satisfaction of being comparable to M Nights' glory days but I am sad to say I am disappointed.The film is about three teenage girls who are unexpectedly kidnapped in a parking lot by a mentally ill man with dissociative identity disorder. He has 23 different personalities and a 24th called the beast which seems to be the most threatening of them all. The hype for this one seemed to be real and I heard many raving about it but I didn't have fun during this film.I know many won't agree with some of my criticisms but I wish I could have liked this more.First of all the film should have been shorter. There were areas of the film that dragged. M Night was trying to build tense moments , a lot of which I felt fell short and were worn out. I have a background in psychology and know of dissociative identity disorder but am certain that a lot of the elements of it were fantastical. Too many personalities and that final form stuff just doesn't gel well and borders on silly. Not to mention the shift between characters feels incoherent at times. Saying all that I have to say that James McAvoy is absolutely superb in this. Like so alluringly good. I'm glad an actor of his caliber was able to showcase his range and ability although I wish the film was written better.The transpiring of some of the events were so stupid. There are a few plot holes but I couldn't ever really sit back and enjoy the film. The three actresses did a decent job, Anya Taylor-Joy will certainly become a big name but I have a hard time getting over the implausibility and the buildup to the final act. I don't want to say anything that will spoil it for other viewers but the ending is pretty cool and a nice callback to a time where M Night was on top of his craft.6/10",6,5,18,4 April 2017
Dunkirk," Dunkirk (2017)
","When I saw the IMAX feature clip for this film before watching Rogue One back in December, I just knew I had to watch this film in IMAX. Christopher Nolan is probably the most successful modern day director going today. He was able to establish a niche early on, then came out with a very well received comic book trilogy. He was audacious to go for a sci-fi film that turned out to be quite grand. Here, he took a shot at a war film and I think he has done very well.Dunkirk is told in three phases. On the land, in the sea, and in the air. Each section is connected but the duration of time of each segment differs. The week we see on land involves a young Englishman trying to survive while along the way meeting two fellow young soldiers and being sunk by enemy German fire. The sea portion takes place in a day and involves a civilian boat that is run by a father and son and their attempts to rescue as many soldiers as they can from Dunkirk. The air portion lasts only an hour and follows a fighter pilot and his attempt to take down enemy planes while trying to ration the fuel in his engine.Time is definitely a construct that connects each section in a non linear method. You can literally hear the ticking of a clock in the score, and its persistent. Speaking of the score, Mr Hans Zimmer has outdone himself. The score is ever present and it carries on nearly throughout the entire film. It never lets up and is at times majestic, tense, and absolute momentum building madness. The jarring sounds (especially in IMAX) is phenomenal. IMAX was able to heighten the experience. Every loud gun sounding off and every roaring plane is so precise, loud, and absolutely brings you into the world of the film.The script and dialogue is kept light and its so great that way. There isn't a whole lot of dialogue and there doesn't need to be in this type of war film. Nolan isn't exactly trying to build the strongest of characters. The film is really a cinematic experience. The long shots are beautiful. There is heavy use of practical effects and virtually no CGI. It feels so authentic, and Nolan masters the art of cinema here. The film introduces a few fresh faces and includes some familiar ones, even those who have worked with Nolan in the past. Also Harry Styles (who was surprisingly quite good).I think this film ranks quite highly in Nolan's work. I may need to give it a rewatch to see exactly where it does. I can see why people won't enjoy it because its so different than what Nolan has done in the best. I for one, love the direction he is going in now. He's become a bold and ambitious filmmaker doing what he thinks is write and not really pandering with this one. Its got to be one of the best war films of all time already. Definitely up to par with expectations.8.5/10",8,5,9,29 July 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016)
","I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I read the books as a teenager and was enamored with the wizarding world that JK Rowling managed to create. The films aren't without flaws but they were very enjoyable for the book lovers and casual movie fans alike. The films were enjoyable for adults and children alike. Initially, I didn't care for a spin off or prequel to the Harry Potter franchise; I didn't need anything in that magical universe anymore. I was of the opinion that Rowling should have closed that chapter of her life and focus on a more unique project. However, I still decided to check it out as I heard many people enjoyed this film.I'm sad to say that I did not like it anywhere near as much as the Harry Potter films. The first hour of this film seemed so inconsequential and bland. There's an overabundance of CGI usage to depict some of the beasts. While some scenes with the beasts look great, others looked so reliant on CG that it was distracting and takes you out of the picture. The first hour of the film focuses on introducing the beasts that escaped Newt Scamander's briefcase. I quit the film an hour in because I was sorely disappointed with what I saw.After getting back to the film, I'd say the film gets stronger in the second phase. Once the severity of the Obscurus is revealed the film becomes a bit darker and engages the audience more. There are still questions to be asked and I expect them to be answered in the trilogy (I'm not very fond of the idea of sequels to an unnecessary film). While the film gets better, it still carries none of the charm and fun that made the Harry Potter films so special. The HP films had a purpose and you knew that everything was well thought out, I can't say the same for a very uneven FBAWTFT.I'm not the biggest Eddie Redmayne fan. He can put in a tremendous performance but isn't in many films that I really like. He was a considerably weak leading man. Its hard to get invested in his character who is just there and becomes second to whoever else he is on screen with. Katherine Waterston is committed to her role and was one of the best features of this film. There seems to be other characters who are kind of thrown into the film to serve the plot. There are also a few easy way outs in this film. Something big gets solved by a convenient circumstance that gets explained on the spot.This film failed to make a good impression. It has prolonged action sequences and an introduction of many new types of beasts, however outside of a few references to the HP universe the film just feels like it doesn't need to exist. I don't have a lot of faith in the expected trilogy but its going to exist and I pray that it is better. Right now this film is what The Hobbit was to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. LOTR was great and we absolutely did not need The Hobbit trilogy. These beasts and this films concept do not need finding.6/10",6,0,1,16 January 2017
Jackie," Jackie (2016)
","I've always had a huge interest in history, and remember being so enamored with learning about American history. One of the events that have always captivated me was the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and all the circumstances surrounding the event. I always try to watch whatever I can related to JFK and the Kennedy's. As soon as I saw the trailer for this film and heard Natalie Portman would be portraying the lead, I had a great interest to see it. I love Natalie Portman and always will try to see whatever she is in. I enjoyed hearing how she was garnering Oscar buzz and had to see the performance myself.Having seen bits and bobs of Jackie Kennedy giving the White House tour, I'd say Portman does quite a good job and portraying Jackie's accent and the way that she speaks. I'm pretty sure she did her homework and it showed, as at times she just disappears into the role. I've seen most of the Oscar nominated films of the year and I'd say Portman may be very close to a lock for her second Oscar. What I really liked about the film is that its scope is limited to just a few days after the death of JFK. Thus you get to view Jackie at her most pained and vulnerable. Once again, I think Portman's portrayal makes the film. As Jackie walks around aimlessly in the halls of the White House you can she how disheveled and exposed she is (although she still must maintain appearances).The first thing you will notice about the film is the score, which opens the film. Its hard to describe, but the score is a mix of dissonance and something of harmony. Its almost like an instrument trying to play a cheerful tune despite being broken, and its really powerful. Its a truly wonderful and pained score. The films narrative is interjected with events of the assassination, Jackie's White house tour, the events after the assassination and her transition out of the White House, and the interview by Theodore H. White. I didn't care how or when it was done but I thought it was vital to show the shooting and the events with JFK on Jackie's lap while the car was rushing away. I'm happy to say Pablo Larrain does not shy away from this event and its shown in its brutality (which is necessary).There's a lack of things going on as the film has a limited time frame but the intention is to place the microscope on one of the most beloved figures in American history during the toughest transition of her life. It feels like a whirlwind at times because you get to see Jackie's life as the first lady and how quickly things changed and how her life turns upside down. I thought Peter Sarsgaard had the look of Bobby Kennedy but not really the speech or mannerisms. I thought Barry Pepper was great at Bobby in that Kennedy miniseries and I was hoping for something of that sort. Had no idea it was Greta Gerwig portraying Nancy Tuckerman until after googling the films cast. Caspar Phillipson looked a lot like JFK in the doses that we seem him.I'm quite pleased that a film about Jackie Kennedy was made, its a biopic I can get behind, especially with an actress like Portman at the helm. I don't think the film is perfect but it gets key elements right. It was vital to portray Jackie faithfully, show the events of the motorcade, and portray Jackie's vulnerability. The film succeeds on those fronts. In the film Jackie wonders what JFK's short legacy as President would be remembered as and tries to remind everyone that for a brief moment 'it was Camelot'. Its important to see the positives in one of the ugliest events of American history. The film has to go through a lot of sad and ugly moments but is balanced by the grace of Portman's Jackie.7/10",7,1,5,2 January 2017
Yesterday," Yesterday (2019)
","And the award for the most brilliant idea for a film goes to: Yesterday. I went wild when I first heard about this film. Danny Boyle directing a movie about a brown guy who plays Beatles songs, in a world that has forgotten about the Beatles existence. Extraordinarily fun premise. I adore The Beatles, if it were lucrative to be a Beatles historian, that would be my dream job. I had such a blast with this film. It pays tribute to the greatest and most influential band ever and also serves up a charming love story.The film is about a down out of luck musician who gets hit by a bus during a weird global occurrence where the world has a blackout. He soon finds out that the world inexplicably does not know of The Beatles, its members, or any of their music. Using this to his advantage, the protagonist named Jack Malik, uses the Beatles works as his own and eventually gains worldwide recognition as a renown artist. He must balance his new found superstardom and the feelings he has for his friend and former manager.This is the film debut of Himesh Patel who is so good in this film. You get behind the characters plight and his story. He is a talented musician no doubt as his renditions of Beatles classics in the film are quite good. Richard Curtis's script and idea is quite great and innovative, despite it not being perfect. It doesn't always score but for the most part it does a great blend of music, drama, romance, and comedy. I like how clever it allows itself to be. If you're a fan of The Beatles like me and can catch every reference to the band and their songs its even better.I think I'd be clinically depressed if I somehow forgot about the wonderful work of The Beatles and also knew I could never hear a song about them again. Their music is so important to me and I love that a film came out about a 'What if' scenario for if everyone forgot The Beatles. At its core, its got a really cute and charming love story as well. I'm very much pleased with this film. I'm really down for seeing more of Himesh Patel and the ever expanding filmography of Danny Boyle.8/10",8,1,2,6 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers: Endgame (2019)
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to a point where a film feels like an actual event. We have been waiting in anticipation for a year to see the final showdown that started in Infinity War. Actually, scratch that. The entire Infinity Saga started way back with Iron Man. 22 films, countless number of heroes coming together in the culminating battle against Thanos. So much anticipation, ticketing app crashes, and going through so much to try to see this on opening night. Now here we are. Does Avengers: Endgame live up to its high expectations? Absolutely. I felt like it was unique and carries the most emotional weight off anything in this universe but it absolutely serves its fans who have been loyal for years and years.The film takes place three weeks after the end of Infinity War. Half of the worlds population have been wiped out by Thanos and now the remaining Avengers (who just so happen to consist summarily of the original Avengers) must find a way to not only defeat Thanos, but also avenge the fallen and find a way to counteract the actions that occurred at the end of Infinity War. As expected the film stars a gigantic cast of Hollywood's best and watch out for the cameos from heroes who have appeared previously in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I really would like to talk about this film in a spoiler review but as with every review on my site, there will be no spoilers. I will say that this film has a unique take almost immediately. The humor and banter is still there as it always is and the character arcs are as fantastic as ever at its near completion. The film carries the most emotional weight as anything this universe has seen. The film has so much fan service. I think if you go early on and with a packed crowd of fans you will see just how much this means to the audience who have stayed loyal to this saga.There were laughs, there were cheers, there were gasps, and yes there were tears. The film feels like it should be the very last that the MCU has to offer but of course we know there are Spider-Man and Black Panther sequels coming. The final battle brings just about everything you could hope for. If you're a fan of the series I think you will enjoy this film as it makes a case of being the best Avengers film. It goes hand in hand with Infinity War, of course both films were shot together.Members of the original Avengers put on performances that do their characters the utmost justice after being on this journey for a decade. The film builds up quite slowly but once the plot takes form and the battle lines are drawn it delivers in the way the Russo brothers know how to. Th action is there, and all of what makes the Marvel Universe such a sweeping phenomenon is always there. Some characters could get more screen time, sure. You have to remember that there are so many characters that the film has to juggle and it does that admirably as it is.The film will be a box office hit for sure and will be well reviewed in regards to the Universe as I can already see. I will be seeing this again tomorrow morning and have the same excitement going into a second viewing as I did my first. I found this to be a very special entry and feel like it ties up so much in such a perfect fashion. If you are a fan of superhero fans you need to see this as soon as possible and should do..Whatever it takes.9/10",10,8,18,26 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Toy Story 4 (2019)
","I think most peoples initial thoughts when they heard about this film were along the lines of 'is this film really necessary?' After all, the third film in the trilogy seemed to wrap everything up so perfectly and was as sweet and sentimental as it could be. Yet here we were with a fourth installment. I'm sure Toy Story is a lucrative venture for Disney and Pixar so that could have been reason enough from a financial stand point. Having seen it a few days back I have to say, this film continues the trend of quality and I found it to be a perfect mix of emotion, comedy, and loveliness.Our toy friends are now living with Bonnie, who is now starting school. While at school she creates a toy made from a spork and other surrounding trash. One day, this spork (Forky) escapes and Woody goes after him. Along the way he runs into Bo Peep who was given away years ago. Woody must try to keep Bonnie happy as he is quickly becoming less and less relevant in her eyes. There's a whole lot more to this film that I don't want to get into. All of our wonderful toy friends are back, what more could you ask for?I'd like to start off with how good the animation was. There is an animated cat in this film and just looking at this cat is proof of how far animation has come as a whole. Its incredible. The film provides a good dose of laughs that will please both adults and their kids. I loved the Key and Peele voiced duo and having Keanu Reeves doing voice work for this as well. Buzz has become less relevant in the main storyline but is as entertaining as ever. Forky seems to built from nothing but he is such a complex character in the way he finds his way, don't let that get lost in the shuffle.The major toys have arcs that they need to complete. Its such a well written film that did not feel necessary at first but then you see it and feels like it was the perfect ending to the series (if it ends there). Its an emotional punch which goes to show how great this series is at evoking a strong reaction. I liked this film better than Toy Story 2 and maybe even Toy Story 3. It proves itself to be an essential addition, strange as that seems. Just all around a perfectly good time, which for me was great. I do ask that they stop here with the series though.9/10",9,38,71,26 June 2019
The Favourite," The Favourite (2018)
","Yorgos Lanthimos is quite an impressive filmmaker. I absolutely loved The Lobster. It was unique and cynically funny. I also enjoyed the creativity and somber delivery of The Killing of a Sacred Deer. For The Favourite it seemed like a different type of venture for Lanthimos, but certainly one where he would be able to implement his creativity and filming techniques. The Favourite is good in exactly the way you would expect it to be.The film is about Queen Anne and her favourite Sarah Churchill. Churchill's cousin, Abigail Hill soon arrives to the kingdom looking for a job. She eventually gets close to the ailing Queen and Sarah and Abigail start to battle for the Queen's affection. The Queen has a history of health problems so she needs someone to attend to her consistently. The motives of Abigail seem unclear because she seems to have many different interests and pursuits. The film stars an excellent cast of Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone, with supporting roles from Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn.Yorgo's style is still ever present in this film. The camera uses fish eye and wide shots that encompass the entire grand scenery and decor of the castle. He uses natural lighting which is a common thread in his work. The characters are very well acted, especially Coleman who was just born to scream at servants and complain loudly about everything. I thought the film touches on a relationship between women but doesn't linger on it long enough. The film has comedic one liners as is expected from Lanthimos' work. Its a very interesting film with memorable characters with motivations you can't see.The film is so very nice to look at but for me doesn't have as strong a presence of something like The Lobster. This is a historical work so I can see restrictions in the imagination that we are used to seeing from Lanthimos but its still a very interesting work because of the intricacies of the relationship between the three leads and how mad they become as the film goes along. its prim and proper in appearance but there's a royal madness to it all. Its worth the watch, and I'm excited for the next chapter of work from the filmmaker.7.5/10",7,21,45,23 November 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
","I can't remember the last time I was so hyped for a film like this. Probably back in 2008 with the release of The Dark Knight. Well, ten years later here I was doing the same routine. Watching trailers over and over, avoiding all possible spoiler news about the film, and aching to watch it on opening day. Finally, the wait was over and I finally watched the film. While, I still don't think its my personal favorite Marvel film despite expecting it to be, the film is overall a very good film despite its different tone. Furthermore, there are no plot spoilers in this review, there may be thoughts but no real spoilers.The film is the next installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which sees the Titan, Thanos, on a serious quest to find the Infinity Stones. The various stones let him control basic aspects of the world and make him powerful. The collection of all of them could change the universe drastically and make him the decider of anything that occurs Of course, The Avengers and surrounding heroes make it a mission to stop him and so we see our heroes unite (and split up) to attempt to take down this force that is unlike anything they've ever seen before.There are a few negatives of the film but nothing that really bring down the quality of it so much. I think the Russo brothers did a generally good job of doing this ambitious crossover combining many characters from different films. However, some do not get enough screen time. Its nothing crazy, but it was expected. There are a lot of humor moments, most hit but not all. That might bother some of the viewers wanting less of that. Also, there are some major plot points that were dumb and questionable, not getting into it though.I highly appreciated Josh Brolin as Thanos. One weakness of previous Marvel entries was a weak or generic villain. Finally we have one with a well fleshed out back story and one that is unpredictable. Thanos is legitimately threatening and you feel scared for the superheros when he is on screen. There are some moments that feel emotional and it ropes you in well. I feel like the tone and nature of this film is darker than anything in the MCU which I liked. Finally, things feel like they have consequences. The battles are for the most part fun and what you expect. The film is definitely incomplete because it was shot together with the next Avengers.I have a lot more to say but feel worn out, in a good way. The real strength of Infinity War is being able to see characters you love interacting with one another. Ten years of films, were all leading to this and you can tell the filmmakers but a lot of effort and heart into it. It won't please everyone and does come with flaws and complaints but I think its an event that every comic book fan has to see in the theaters. I am ready for the hype for the next Avengers.8.5/10",9,2,5,28 April 2018
Get Out," Get Out (2017)
","I am a huge fan of Jordan Peele. I loved Key and Peele and loved that the duo stepped into making a film with a pretty good comedy in Keanu. All that said I had some strong reservations about Jordan Peele stepping out of his comedic element and into a horror especially one that is psychological. I didn't know what to make of the trailer. I was thinking that this had to be one of those 'horrors with humor', I just couldn't see Peele stepping that far out of his comfort zone. While I feel this film gets overrated by the masses, its quite a successful venture for Peele.The film follows a black man named Chris and his white girlfriend Rose. Rose decides to introduce her boyfriend to her family. While everything seems peachy at first it soon becomes obvious to Chris that something is way wrong. The black workers in the house act so weird and reserved and the extended family and friends of Rose are far too intrigued by Chris and the color of his skin. While I won't divulge any deeper into the plot, I'd say this was a fairly satisfying film. Its an interesting effort by Peele, that has some real world relativism.The scares are predictable and come in moments that are exactly where we expect them to be. The film still keeps you engaged and entertained and coming up with theories of your own as you go along for the right. The film is kind of predictable at least the main arc of what is actually going on with the family. That really doesn't take away from what is given. There is a fair bit of nice imagery, which goes to show some of the creativity Peele had for this. The social and racial aspect of this film can't be denied, its a bit of a social commentary.This will probably be a breakout role for Kaluuya, he's come a long way from that episode of Black Mirror. The film received higher praise than i think it deserves but it does a good job at being a thrilling and engaging film. I am very optimistic about seeing whatever Jordan Peele decides to do next because I am certain now that he is very capable of going outside the comedy box.7.5/10",7,9,16,9 May 2017
Aladdin," Aladdin (2019)
","We are deep in the new age of Disney. One where beloved animated features are remade in a live action format, for better or for worse. When Aladdin was announced, I was game. The animated version is one of my favorite Disney films and I liked the look of the actor they got to play Aladdin. Will Smith's genie definitely looked weird and creepy when they first showed him but I was still going to give this a fair shot. Having seen it, it was better than I expected it to be. As a matter of fact, it was thoroughly enjoyable.The film is a bout a poor street thief names Aladdin, who one day encounters the princess of the city of Agrabah. He stumbles across a magic lamp and a eccentric magical genie who grants him three wishes. Aladdin wants to enlist the help of the genie to win the heart of the princess. However, an evil sorcerer who advises for the Sultan of Agrabah wants to get hold of the genie to enable his evil plans of becoming the Sultan himself. The film stars Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, Will Smith, and Marwan Kenzari.I thought overall the casting was solid. Massoud is great as Aladdin in this, and emulates the animated version. Scott is a beautiful and worthy Jasmine, Smith is a highlight in the film due to his bombastic and entertaining performance. The only downside was Kenzari as Jafar. Was so unbelievably hammy and a terrible fit in the role, for me anyways. Apart from that its nice to see a live action update on a beloved tale. For the most part the effects, costume design, and the fantastical world created looked wonderful. At times the CG on Abu and Rajah looked ropy.This is a long film. Its a full 40 minutes longer than the animated classic. It adds new elements to the film but overall feels like a modern and fairly faithful update to the animated film. Much like Beauty and The Beast. I can see people not being blow away by this but for what it was and how bad it could have been, I was pretty impressed. Not sure how I feel about the live action Disney films in the long run but Aladdin is one of the better ones for sure.7.5/10",7,9,29,24 May 2019
The Lion King," The Lion King (2019)
","I think we all have seen The Lion King as a child. Whether you want to admit it or not, its a Disney classic. The songs and lines from the film are memorable and its up there with Disney animated ventures from their best decade. I question the need for every Disney live action film coming out but I've been surprised. Lion King was a strange case. Its got a great voice cast for sure but it looks like a feature length National Geographic documentary. I heard bad things about this going in. I'd say its decent. It follows the original work very, very, closely and I think it takes a lot of the if it ain't broke don't fix it philosophy.The film takes place in the animal kingdom, where the king lion Mufasa has recently had a son named Simba. This young cub is destined to be the new leader at the behest of his scheming and jealous uncle Scar. Simba quickly learns the dangers of being next in line for the throne and then has to learn how to grow up and be a leader to his kingdom. The film interestingly brought back James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa. The film has a lot of voice talent like Donald Glover, Beyonce, and Seth Rogen.The visual and realistic nature of the animals is fairly amazing. The animals look so real and the recreation of the original animated features scenes is pretty remarkable. I thought visually its as good as can be. The film could have used some originality for sure but I wasn't so bothered with a remake that closely follows the source material. I haven't seen the animated version in a long time so recalling moments through a new film wasn't so bad. I felt some parts were very rushed though and not done as well as the original.The score and recreation of the classic songs was nice regardless. I know there will be a lot of complaining and it won't please everyone but I felt like it was a solid film and a good enough watch. Not very many complaints. I don't think it possesses all of the magic of the original but its still a faithful effort and I really mean you can see the effort there visually but maybe not so much so creatively. Pretty sure this will be a cash cow regardless for Disney as it was pretty hyped.7/10",7,1,5,20 July 2019
A Quiet Place," A Quiet Place (2018)
","I think the trailer for this film interested a mass majority of movie goers. The film looked like it took place in a post apocalyptic future where humans have to go through a lot just for survival. the most remarkable thing was how quiet the trailer was, the use of silence seemed effective. I was also interested in seeing John Krasinski handle a major studio horror film. I watched The Hollars but I felt like this was Krasinski's time to make a big wave.The film is about a family who live in solitude with their son and their deaf daughter. They must be careful to be absolutely quiet as there is something that lurks in the shadows and waits to hear sound to prey and attack. They must find a way to not only survive but work on a way to defeat what they are being hunted by. The film stars and is directed John Krasinski and real life wife. The great Millicend Simmonds (who is deaf in real life and also wonderful in Wonderstruck) is also in it.The film uses silence so excellently. The film is dead quiet at many times and all you hear is the effective score or natural surroundings. It creates a wonderful atmosphere. The film also packs a real emotional bunch in its short duration length which was surprising. The performances are spot on. I can't help but point out (as many people already have) how stupid it is to have a baby in this type of environment. Makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from that, the film is worth your time.The film manages to live up to expectations and also exceeds them in other ways. The film is fairly original and interesting, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. You want to know so much; not all the questions are answered but I really appreciate Krasinski and company's ambition to go a different route with a horror film and deliver a really solid film that is fun, absorbing, and even has heart. I think John Krasinski finally has something good in his hands.7.5/10",7,16,29,7 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Call Me By Your Name (2017)
","As soon as I heard this film receiving some award buzz, I knew that I would have to see it. Interesting film title aside, I really went into this film blind not quite knowing what to expect. Sometimes Oscar films can be a bit baity and overbearing or not worth some of the praise it receives, that is the truth. I can say, that does not apply for this film. I don't know what my favorite film of the year is just yet but I'd except Call Me By Your Name to be in the top ten of the year.This film is about a 17 year old boy living in Italy who falls for an American assistant to his father, who comes and stays with them for a period of time. Elio (Timothée Chalamet), soon realizes that he has feelings for this older man and they begin a relationship. Elio has to come to grips with his sexual awakening and see if a relationship is possible despite being in a relationship with a local girl. There's definitely much more to the film than my horrible summary of it, that's for sure.Its a coming of age film of sorts but feels so fresh and like it makes a point to be different. New face Chalamet is now here to stay, having appeared in both Lady Bird and this film. He is fantastic in it and this happens to be the best I've seen from Armie Hammer as well. I had to just see two minutes of this film to conclude that this was a Luca Guadagnino film, the vibrant color and the gorgeous vacation setting cinematography made it feel like A Bigger Splash, and it turns out to be a spiritual successor in a trilogy to that film.The backdrop of the 80s works so nicely with the film because this was also a time where homosexuality was quite hidden but becoming public. The score and soundtrack for this film is fantastic. 'Love My Way' hasn't sounded this good since the Grand Theft Auto Vice City days. Once you finish the film, you know that you've been treated to something special and a strong contender during awards season.8/10",8,8,18,7 December 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017)
","I am by no means a fan of the POTC franchise. I enjoyed the first one but didn't care a whole lot about the rest. After the trilogy they should have buried the franchise but instead returned with On Stranger Tides and now a new installment. Marketing for this was low, as it just came and went without making a wave or splash (hehe). I heard some really awful things about the film. I do agree that the franchise really needs to retire itself but at the same time the film isn't actually terrible. Its not very good, however a few things stand out.The film follows the adventures of Jack Sparrow once again this time accompanied by the son of Will Turner and a potential love interest. A dead crew led by Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar are after Sparrow and are ruthless in their approach to get him. We once again get large scale nautical adventures with exactly what you would expect out of a Pirates film. The film doesn't tread any new ground. Its a case of, 'if you've seen one, you've seen them all.'Jack Sparrow's whimsically drunken and eccentric nature is running its course. Its the same old for five films now. The film still does feel overlong, despite being the shortest in the franchise. There is some nice back and forth, especially from Kaya Scodelario's character but overall even the dialogue feels worn. The air of familiarity is present throughout. I must say though Javier Bardem is a stand out as Salazar. That man was born to play a villain.The best aspects are when we see Salazar and his crew. The effects for re-creating the crew are actually quite spectacular and you notice this just from seeing the trailer. There are some stupidly enjoyable moments but they don't often come around. Still, I'd rather have seen this then check out the newest Transformers film (I am dreading seeing that horror show). Overall, nothing new in a tired series but special effects are top notch.6.5/10",7,1,4,6 September 2017
Hidden Figures," Hidden Figures (2016)
","Here comes a film about three women who were crucial to the American space race and not many know about this story. I certainly did not. I'd say these types of biopics are necessary as awareness for people who have contributed so much in the past and shaped our lives in a better way. The film is about three black women who try to overcome segregation and unequal work rights in the workplace. One of these women (a mathematician), calculates the trajectory for Project Mercury and the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the Moon.This film is one that's built on its performances, especially a typically strong one from Taraji P. Henson. She's almost always great in her roles. Hidden Figures required to be a sort of mousy, quiet worker. However, the prejudice against her because of her race/gender get to her and then she becomes impassioned. Katherine Goble Johnson (who is played by Henson) is a brilliant person and is able to snide it in a few situations to people who doubted her. I also liked Janelle Monae in this and hope to see her in more in the future.As I stated earlier this is a story that not many people know about. I know of John Glenn and his accomplishments but not of the women behind what he did. The film is powerful in the fact that it shows how unexpected people can be responsible for great things. The film also carries a message of moving on from segregation and moving towards something great (as a result of being united). The messages are very important and the film is very safe in its exploration of discrimination, which should please general moviegoers.I wasn't a big fan of Theodore Melfi's St. Vincent. The film had a remarkable performance from Bill Murray but really failed to be memorable as a whole. With Hidden Figures I think there is an improvement in presenting a story and staying in a successful storytelling structure. Its a pleasant film that does not do a whole lot wrong.7/10",7,0,4,16 January 2017
Coco," Coco (2017)
","I am not a huge fan of animated films. I can count on one hand the number of animated films that I truly enjoy. However, there's something about Pixar, where they do have the best quality animated features. I really liked Inside Out (which surprised the hell out of me) and do like the Toy Story trilogy. I didn't think a whole lot of Coco from the trailers I saw but had to give it a fair chance. I really liked this film, it was entertaining, creative, emotional, and wonderful to look at.The film is about a young boy named Miguel who lives with his family in a household that is strictly against any form of music. This stems from his great grandmother being abandoned by her father who was a musician. One day on Día de Muertos, Miguel attempts to borrow the guitar of a famous deceased musician and finds himself transported (and stuck in) the realm of the dead. The only way to get back is to get a blessing from a family member before sunrise. Along the way, Miguel tries to find out who is musician ancestor is.I enjoyed this film the whole way through. Once again the content of the film was creative and had a lot of heart as is regularly the case with a Pixar film. I think the film does a great job of portraying an interesting look into Mexican culture, through the depiction of the Day of the Dead, the music, and the family values. The film carries the same amount of depth as something like Inside Out. It also carries a similar amount of fun, silliness and charm. i was pleasantly surprised with how much of it I was enjoying. Parts of the film do drag, sure, but its carried by enough strong moments.The voice acting is great, and visually the film is quite stunning. Its rich and eye popping color give it such a vibrant and alluring feel. The music and score is good. It'll be enjoyable for all ages. Children will be distracted by the animation and the colors and quick action, adults will be enthralled with the deeper themes and tones that really carry this film and make it the best animated film of the year by far.8/10",8,0,2,8 January 2018
1917," 1917 (2019)
","I finally found a war film that I absolutely love. 1917 is the latest effort from a very quality filmmaker in Sam Mendes. Sam Mendes has never made a film that I didn't like and so seeing a new war film from him was something I was going to welcome with open arms. This film from opening frame is an absolute technical and emotional journey. Its worth a watch in the cinemas while you can and something I am looking to go see again when I can.
The film is about the journey of two British soldiers who are tasked with delivering an important message about an impending German ambush on British forces during Operation Alberich. The soldiers go on a long and dangerous journey in order to stop this massive planned attack. The film stars George McKay, Dean Charles Chapman, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, and Benedict Cumberbatch. It is Sam Mendes' first non Bond film since 2009.
The obvious must be stated first. I am a huge fan of long takes. Loved Alfred Hitchcock's Rope which was a pioneer in that technique. Then we had memorable long takes through the years including one of my favorites for Gravity. This entire film is presented as one long take; a riveting continuous shot. It is absolutely incredible and completely contributes to the claustrophobic, frantic, and ever present war setting. Roger Deakins is a legend and needs another Academy Award for his work here. Simply incredible. Everything about the set was realistic. The bodies, dirt, and filth looked so authentic. For two hours you feel like you are in the trenches and in the war field, hearing every shot fired and every roaring plane overhead.
Technically the film is a brilliant achievement. It also composes of an excellent score, one that complements each changing scene in the film. So much went into how the film looks and I love that critics have been appreciating it. I had no problems with the fleeting characters and think the two initial leads and their bond is captured well enough. We are here for the journey which is ever changing and sporadic. Overall, this was an extremely pleasant way to end the year for me. One of the years very best.8.5/10",8,9,15,29 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)
","I love Star Wars. The original trilogy is up there with the best trilogies in film ever. I even see the good in the prequel trilogy, despite their many flaws. I'll find something to love about them. When The Force Awakens came out I was very pleased with the revival of the Star Wars Universe and how fun and exciting the film and new characters were. The perfect blend of nostalgia and a new hope. I welcomed Rian Johnson and his vision for this sequel. This may be me looking at the series with my Star Wars fanboy glasses but this film was very good and a worthy successor and entry into the series.The film directly follows the events of The Force Awakens, where Rey tries to convince Luke to teach her the ways of the Jedi. Conflicted Kylo Ren communicates with Rey while also being under the rule of Supreme Leader Snoke. The Resistance led by General Leia Organa must do what they can do avoid the First Order and their impending attack while trying to mount against them. Old heroes and new faces unite to find a common cause against evil forces. The film definitely feels like a smooth sequel to The Force Awakens.The film boasts a familiar excellent score by John Williams. The set design and effects are fantastic. The theme and use of the color red is eye popping and glorious. The scenes in Snoke's throne room and the final battle with the old speeders on salt and red dust is beautiful. The action sequences are never dull and look exquisite (take some notes, Justice League). Without spoiling anything, there are a few wonderful battle moments which will have Star Wars fans feeling overjoyed with excitement.The film introduces new cuddly critters and has humor, which is a hallmark of the saga. One thing I really love about the series is its ability to build new universes, as if there is infinite possibilities when introducing new worlds and characters. There are some questionable character decisions and plot choices, but this sets up for something grand in the final film of the sequel trilogy. Carrie Fischer has a stronger and more prominent role in this film and I think its a satisfying departure for a very memorable character and actress.So where does the film rank among its predecessors? I think Last Jedi is comfortably better than the prequel trilogy and even outshines Rogue One (which is also really good). It doesn't quite meet the adventure and excitement that The Force Awakens brings, but that's perfectly fine. Its a film I plan to watch and experience again on home media, as is the case with the rest in this film series. Very pleased with this effort. Will be anxiously awaiting the return of JJ Abrams to finish off this trilogy.9/10",9,0,5,17 December 2017
Silence," Silence (2016)
","One of the things I always look forward to is a new Martin Scorsese film. Scorsese is definitely one of the best filmmakers of the past and present, although I haven't been to impressed with his recent streak of films. With Silence, I was hoping for a special film that could rank among some of his best. Silence seemed to be that film that would be a cinematic and spiritual experience. It does not disappoint on that level. However, upon reflection I'm still a bit mixed on this film. In fact I'd say this will polarize the audience and that's probably what Scorsese had in mind.One thing I hope is that people aren't liking this movie because of the religious conflict. I think personal beliefs should be checked at the door when experiencing a film. If you go in with the mindset that this is sacrilegious to Christianity then you will have a biased view. Suspend your beliefs as they would say. I'd say Silence should be viewed in the theater or in the highest quality possible because some of the cinematography is beautiful. The oceans, plains, forest, clouds, pop out at you on the screen. Fog is seen often in the film and its great for suggesting a feeling of unease, anticipation, and even fear of the unknown. Scorsese's camera-work is always a joy to behold and it won't disappoint here. One of the most notable aspects of the film is the lack of non diegeitic music. There's a minimal use of a score, Its truly silence in that aspect. It lets you absorb the world of the film, its nature, and its surroundings.I've not always been sold on Andrew Garfield as a serious actor and I was scratching my head at him being the lead in this film. I'll have to say I have no complaints here. Once you get used to the accents you basically see him at his best performance yet. His character has to show a bit of range as the film progresses, and I thought he did it well. Garfield's Sebastião Rodrigues goes from cautiously optimistic to having a serious crisis of faith . A lot of the film is told from the perspective of his inner monologue which goes hand in hand to his state of mind as events transpire. I liked Adam Driver in this as well. The film could have used more of him.Now to get to my criticisms. Perhaps I got the wrong impression from the subject matter and the trailer but I was expecting more action/violence. This is definitely not that kind of film. Which is fine, however there are times where the film could have used more violence to build fear. What happens to Garfield and his Christian faithful is a scary thing (in a scary land) but sometimes there seems to be no urgency. I had problems with the pacing. This was not a film that flew by. At its near three hour length, you will feel the length. The first act is slow, second act picks up but then drops in the final act. The final minutes are fairly predictable and the method of telling the story at this point felt odd.We live in a pretty modern time but I could have seen this film being pretty controversial in an earlier decade (much like Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ). The themes and messages would have driven a fair few into a minor fit. God is silent and remains silent, through your pain. Your unwavering dedication to God; what does it mean? What purpose does it serve? Is it more important than living? This was a passion project for Scorsese , which doesn't always mean its going to be fun at all times for us. I'd say this is a good film but I couldn't help but feel disappointed after expecting something of a masterclass from a fantastic filmmaker. By no means is it a bad film. I think I had problems with the delivery but the subject matter of the film is deep. I don't think its one of Scorsese's best; it wouldn't crack my top 5 of his filmography. If you are a fan of his work, I think you owe it to yourself to see it and form your own opinion about it. Just be prepared to invest your time into it. The film could yet be a grower and be something I love in a few weeks.7.75/10",7,1,8,28 December 2016
Logan," Logan (2017)
","The final Wolverine has come and gone and the review for this seemed to indicate that was one of the best superhero movies of all time. While I don't necessarily agree with this I think the film was an interesting approach to a fan favorite film hero and a balls out action heavy conclusion to the Hugh Jackman fronted Wolverine era in the X-Men franchise. It will please many people but I hope we have reached finality with the Wolverine character before Hollywood goes crazy for a reboot.This film follows Logan who is now older and weaker. The adamantium skeleton is slowly killing him and he lives in a dystopian future where no mutant has been born for 25 years. He meets a young girl who has the same powers as Logan and has been bred from DNA garnered from mutants. The first thing that must be said is that this is a very different and more somber approach to a popular superhero. He is beaten and near broken but fighting with whatever kick is left in him. While I appreciate this more unique take in the Marvel universe I don't think its as stellar as people make it out to be. That's not to take away from a solid film in the hands of a director who knows what he is doing.Its a pretty violent film, its expected from an R rated action film regardless of it being in the Marvel world. The fight scenes are intense and don't really let you down. The film is pretty simplistic and doesn't attempt to accomplish more than it should. Its pretty emotional as well. I would have liked more connection with some of the other characters of the X-Men franchise but this was all about Logan and that's probably the best way to go about it.The film is long which i think kind of works against the film as the film could have been perfectly fine 30 minutes shorter. Logan isn't really my favorite Marvel character nor is he my favorite X-Men, but its hard to deny the giant impact and perfect casting that Hugh Jackman brought to this character. He seriously brought it to life, which is why I hope they let Wolverine in film rest because we don't need another Spiderman situation going on here. The film isn't amazing but its a different approach and a fitting farewell to a beloved character.7/10",7,0,4,9 May 2017
Hotel Mumbai," Hotel Mumbai (2019)
","For some reason, the tragic events that occurred in Mumbai in 2008 is something I can't recall ever hearing of. I was a stupid 18 year old college kid at the time and had no knowledge on world news. I was semi interested in seeing this just because I am kind of a film junkie and go out and watch releases just because. I thought this film was surprisingly great. Its really tough to watch at times and will incite an angry and somber reaction at times but there's no denying the effect that this film leaves on you.The film is about the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, namely on the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. The film follows a group of attendants and customers in the hotel and their struggle for survival as they are attacked by a terrorist party. The events at the hotel coincide with 12 coordinated attacks in the city. They must find a way to endure while special forces arrive to Mumbai as they are 100s of miles away. The film stars Dev Patel, Armie Hammer, Jason Isaacs, and Nazanin Boniadi.The film does such a good job of eliciting a reaction in you. Weather its grief, anger, confusion, or uncomfortably; the film draws you in from the very beginning. Its not an easy watch at all, innocent people get murdered and its an absolute shame to think that people can actually go and do this in real life. It made me so angry. You really start feeling for the characters and root for them and want to see the perpetrators suffer the absolute worst. The film is unflinching, and the editing and sound of the film will make you feel like yo are right in the mix of the events.Hotel Mumbai is not going to be for the people with a weak stomach but if you are a film lover who wants to see a good film based on true events, you should see this. Trust me, I can easily watch almost anything in a film and rarely feel like its a tough watch but I felt it here. I think its just important to be aware of things that have occurred that we want to turn away from, its how we learn to grow better and see what the evil in this world is capable of. A very impressive directional debut by Anthony Maras.7.5/10",7,8,49,31 March 2019
Midsommar," Midsommar (2019)
","Hereditary was one of my favorite films of last year. it was such a unique and unsettling film. If anything, it showed that Ari Aster was a force on his directorial debut. We all wondered what as next. Midsommar quickly became my most hyped film of the summer and I vowed to see it as soon as it comes out. Midsommar is exactly what I wanted it to be and more. This will be a polarizing film, I feel but I already know that I want to rewatch it because it is truly a mesmerizing experience.The film is about a group of friends who travel to Sweden for a celebration that occurs every 90 years. The protagonist (played by Florence Pugh), recently experienced a traumatic loss and goes on this trip with her boyfriend in hopes of repairing their very distant relationship. Everything seems beautiful and serene at first but the group soon realize that this festival is not normal at all and the bizarre cult-like events are actually a lot more dangerous than they seem.Ari Aster shows that he is already an expert in filmmaking. This film is a very loose horror as a lot of it is comedic, abstract, visual, and more unsettling than scary. Its perfect that way and shows the range Aster has. The lighting, setting, and cinematography in this film are absolutely stellar. It is an absolutely beautiful looking picture. Someone else who really shows range is Florence Pugh. From playing Lady Macbeth, to a WWE wrestler, to a girl going through an absolutely traumatic experience.A lot of this film is humorous. Its hard not to burst out laughing at the uncomfortably bizarre sequence of events in this film. The pagan like rituals in this film are just so engorging to behold and you just want to know more and more at the mythos behind this cult. The film is so unique in its nature but the creativity and imagery flow through, much like with Hereditary.This is pure unhinged ambition from Aster. He takes the reigns off from what he did with Hereditary and explores a beautifully terrifying event with people who are darker than they seem. The film is a slow burn but its fun to just stare at every frame and behold the transpiring of absolute madness. Its an absolute psychedelic trip from start to finish. Prepare for two and a half hours of weird and freaky. Let the festivities begin.8.5/10",8,70,143,3 July 2019
La La Land," La La Land (2016)
","All I needed was one whiff of the original trailer for this film (accompanied by Gosling's 'City of Stars') and I was in love. I really loved Damien Chazelle's Whiplash. I'm generally a fan of films driven by music and that film was a great student v. teacher scenario. However, this was on another level and felt so honed. There are so many things about this picture that I want to applaud and I know that if I watched it again I could probably write another essay on a set of different things about this that I enjoyed.From the very opening scene, the films aura is set. The musical numbers are expertly choreographed and the multitude of vibrant colors are present very often. Some of the scenes are just so gorgeous and pulsating. There are scenes where the backdrop of LA looks magnificent. The original songs are very good. Even if you do not appreciate a particular song, you will love the busy work on the screen. There is something going on in every frame; your eyes will be glued to something. 'City of Stars' is such a catchy tune. I wasn't surprised that Ryan Gosling was able to sing and perform on the piano as I'm a big fan of that hunk and know he has his own band. Apparently, he learned the piano for this film which is insane (especially if he played the piano for all of his scenes). You would think he's been at it for years. I think there is good chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Emma Stone's character is identifiable. She's the prototype of someone who has high ambitions, passion, and is unsure of whether others would feel the same way. I found this very real. There's an inherent theme of having a dream and how much hard work is involved in succeeding in that dream. Its tough to accomplish the dream because not everyone will feel the same way or identify with what you are doing. At times you have to take the practical road in life. However, if you stay on course for your passion you may achieve something down the road. This resonated so much for me and I loved it, but I don't want to get stuck in talking about that. Before I go off another tangent, let me just say that this was the best performance by Emma Stone yet. Both leads had to show a bit of versatility for this film and they did very well.I'd say there's not much else going on with the other characters outside of the two leads. The spotlight is on Gosling and Stone the entire time and I liked it that way. The set designs within the film were eye popping and beautiful to look at. A lot of this film is a love letter to Hollywood. You see it in the Ingrid Bergman, the Marilyn Monroe painting, and other places throughout the film. The film is essentially a tribute and revival of 50's Hollywood, which is another reason why I really liked this film. The musical genre is sort of dying in Hollywood (much like jazz in real life and in the film). I did not like jazz growing up, until I took an intro to jazz class in college and started appreciating the art form. So much goes into jazz, its improvisation, and I appreciated the pioneers of the genre who paved the way of not only other musicians of the genre but popular musicians in other genres to follow. I loved that Gosling's character was enamored with jazz and its history. The two leads are so passionate about what they love (another thing that resonated for me). The mix of music and cinema blended so well together.The last twenty or so minutes of the film honestly floored me and I really wouldn't change any of it. I think a lot of people will enjoy this film. From a technical standpoint I think this is definitely the Best Picture frontrunner. It doesn't have that heavy handed emotionally dramatic plot that the Academy loves but everything else about it screams the favorite for the Oscar. Chazelle did a fantastic job of mixing his love for jazz music and film and finding symmetry with this film. I'd have to compile a list of the best films of the year but this will be somewhere near the very top. Very pleased with La La Land.One final thing, my man crush on Ryan Gosling has grown tenfold. The guy can rock a suit better than anyone in Hollywood and is as charming as they get.9/10",9,3,8,17 December 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Beauty and the Beast (2017)
","Ever since I heard about the news about a live action adaptation of this Disney classic I was over the moon. I was even more excited to hear Emma Watson was going to play Belle. I'm a big fan of her and will watch any of her work. There was still a bit of cautiousness about this adaptation. The animated musical is my favorite Disney film of all time and it was completely possible to be disappointed because of it not holding up to the 1991 version. Now having seen it I must say this film was great. If you are a fan of the animated film I think you wont be let down by this very faithful re-imagining.I'll start with the negatives if they can even be called that. I think the CGI Beast looked odd and off at times, especially around the face. Dan Stevens is completely unrecognizable but still some of the Beast scenes have a slight hindrance of looking computerized. Some of the same could be said with the facial expressions on Mrs. Potts and Chip. This qualm is really minimal though, it must be hard bringing a talking beast and talking teacup to life so this is barely a criticism. The film is quite long, the animated classic is basically spread out with even more songs and scenes between Belle and The Beast. Its not really bad as it doesn't really take away from the fantastical experience. The Beauty and the Beast main theme was kind of disappointing. Emma Thompson did a nice job but the song doesn't compare to the Angela Lansbury version which is supreme. Lastly, the castle design should have followed the animated version more closely, in my opinion.The production and set design is fabulous. I'm sure a lot of the scenes were computerized however it all looks great. The scene of Belle singing up on to the hills early on in the film looks magnificent. The castle and costume design is on point. The costumes especially bring the animated characters to life. There is so much going on on screen and your eyes are captivated by it all. I'm talking especially about the 'Be Our Guest' song, its absolutely spectacular. The music is also great and for the most part faithfully re-recorded and completely respects the songs in the Disney classic.People were complaining about Emma Watson portraying Belle. I think she may put a lot of the critics to rest now. She handles the Belle character with grace, beauty, and a strong willing persuasion. Every scene I felt like the animated Belle came to life. Dan Stevens and Ewan McGregor voice (and motion capture I guess) were great. Luke Evans was an MVP as the brash, cocky, and downright jerky Gaston. The cast all did a great job of bringing their counterparts to life. I was hesitant about Bill Condon helming the film but now am glad that he did.This was a very faithful live update to the animated film from 1991. There are more songs and space for characters to grow and cinematography to pop but its all very respectful to its predecessor. Overall, if you are a die-hard fan of the animated version I think you will love it. Its a wonderful new addition (and perhaps the strongest one yet) to the live action Disney remake trend. Its a bright and profitable future if these first crop of films are any indication of whats to come.8.5/10",8,3,10,19 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)
","I wasn't raving about the first Guardians of the Galaxy but it was humorous and enjoyable. Didn't think it was the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it was one of the better efforts. I knew I would catch the sequel at some point in time and now that I've seen it, I gotta say I'm a bit mixed about it. I think overall the film is good but is certainly inferior to the first film. Regardless, this film and the MCU still remains a money making vehicle as they head into the next Avengers.This film takes our Guardians on a new path. They are wanted by the Sovereign people after Rocket steals batteries from them. More importantly Peter Quill comes across his father (played by Kurt Russell) who is revealed to be Ego a celestial being with great powers. All is not as it seems, as the film tries to uncover Ego's real motivations.The cosmic visuals of the film are still as good as the first. This was never a problem with the film as cinematically still colorful and eye-popping. I think the humor while still ever present, does not hit its mark as much. There are funny moments, mostly through the MVP character of the film (Baby Groot) but the jokes feel forced and not as natural. The writing in places isn't always strong and the film has a hard time justifying its running length.I will say though the film does a better job of characterization for some of the side players in this film, namely for Michael Rooker's Yondu. He is one of the standouts in this film and is a strong point of the film as he is given great time to develop. While the film doesn't have a lot of negatives I have to say it seems worn down and more manufactured than the first film, which genuinely felt like a free flowing fun film. Its standard sequel stuff really, but the film is still worth a watch. Especially if you are waiting on the next Avengers film that everything is building towards.7/10",7,2,5,9 August 2017
The Shape of Water," The Shape of Water (2017)
","Guilermo del Toro is a solid filmmaker. I'm not overly crazy about his work and don't rate him as highly as many others do, but the visual beauty of his films cannot be denied. I am not crazy about Pans Labyrinth or Pacific Rim but I do actually love Crimson Peak. I was always going to check out The Shape of Water to see if Toro could follow up Crimson Peak with an equally outstanding piece of cinema. While The Shape of Water isn't amazing its quite enjoyable.The film takes place in the 1960's where a mute cleaning women finds a creature has been captured by a Colonel and starts bonding with this otherwordly creature. She attempts to free the creature and falls in love along the way. On the other hand, the Colonel is an aggressive man and is abusive towards the creature and then goes all out to try to figure out who helped the creature escape. The film is set with a back drop of U.S./Soviet tensions and plays a part in minor aspects of the film.This is definitely the best Sally Hawkins performance to date. She is wonderful as a mousy mute woman and does so much terrific acting in the absence of words. Michael Shannon was just born to play a villain and pulls off a typically good Michael Shannon performance. While this film isn't as visually stunning as some of del Torro's other work, the creature design, camera work, and costume and set design is still very top notch.I'd say one thing about Del Torro's film that could be a criticism is the writing. The film is fairly predictable. Its good, but goes down a route that we've seen in similar type of films. Its an entertaining film but its not anything jaw dropping visually or creatively. Strong performances and del Torro's imaginative creature creation keeps the film moving and he creates characters you want to root for. Its not del Torro's best but its definitely going to please his die hard fans.7.5/10",7,12,25,2 December 2017
The Disaster Artist," The Disaster Artist (2017)
","The Disaster Artist I saw The Room a few years back and love it, to the point of obsession. No doubt, its absolutely terrible with a ton of flaws in production, acting, and script. Yet there is something endearing about it, that makes it ridiculously entertaining. I own the damn Bluray because I love it so much. Definitely my favorite 'so bad its good film.' When I heard about The Disaster Artist I was so infatuated with an adaptation of Greg Sestero's book. I loved all the trailers and was anticipating this for a while. Safe to say, The Disaster Artist is actually really good. Very entertaining, funny, and well acted.The film is an autobiographical take, focusing on the beginning of the friendship of Greg and Tommy Wiseau. Wiseau is definitely a mysterious figure and the two soon become friends because of their love for acting. Down out of luck in Hollywood, Wiseau decides to make his own film (with a mysterious fund for the film) and while the film production wasn't without turmoil, the end product turns out to be one of the worst films of all time. And yet, the film becomes a cult hit and a success despite being terrible.I think Franco's filmography is streaky to not very good (although admittedly I've only seen stuff here and there) but this most be his best work. Franco captures most of the embodiment of Tommy Wiseau and is so magnetic with his awkward mannerisms, ideas that don't make any sense, and his foreign accent. The film is very funny, you will get the humor and enjoy yourself even if you haven't seen The Room. However if you've seen it you will really appreciate what goes on in this film.The film has a few cameo appearances which are cool, stay tuned even after the credits. The film also boasts an incredibly catchy late 90' early 2000's soundtrack and the attention to detail of the recreation of scenes and sets of The Room is almost perfect. This film actually made me want to re-watch The Room and re-experience the wonders of unintended genius of Tommy Wiseau. Franco has done a wonderful job with this film, and even though its about the worst movie ever, the film about the making of it is rather fantastic.8/10",8,4,11,3 December 2017
American Made," American Made (2017)
","Tom Cruise back flying planes again? I'm down for that even if there isn't any Kenny Loggins to vibe to. He's had a terrible time this year starring in the ill-fated The Mummy, so I was hoping for something better this time around. A very positive instrument for the film was having Doug Liman at the helm. I'm a fan of him so had faith that this would entertain. Overall, its not amazing but is decent enough with a typically good Tom Cruise character performance.The film is based on the true story of Barry Seals, the former pilot who gets hired by the CIA to initially get surveillance photos in Central America. However, Seals soon gets drawn into the life of transporting drugs, goods, and weapons to armies and different dealers. He becomes affiliated with the Medellin Cartel and starts doing business with Pablo Escobar. Things get out of hand and he becomes wanted by the FBI and DEA. Seals becomes rich but the costs that come with it become overbearing.The thing I like about Liman is he can work a decent script and works well in close quarters with a minimalist script (this is me basically praising The Wall). I found the events of the film interesting and a bit astonishing, especially if all the government agencies got involved in the ordeal the way the film portrays. Tom Cruise is good in it and makes it worth the watch even when the film falters. His cockiness and energy given to the performance is a strong point.There's a lot going on in the film and you have to keep up with the things Seals is told to do. I found Domhnall Gleeson's 'agent' character mysteriously enticing, though was sad to hear that there's no real factual basis for the role. Overall, its not exactly a must see but a committed Cruise performance and rich real life basis makes the film a positive viewing experience.7/10",7,3,7,3 October 2017
Joker," Joker (2019)
","I've heard very polarizing things about this film prior to checking it out. On one end, I was hearing that the film received standing ovations at international film festivals with Joaquin Phoenix being considered for an Oscar. On the other, I hear many trashing the social commentary and how the film kind of speaks out to or glorifies violence and marginalized hostile communities. I have to say, I was expecting something more however I am definitely very positive about this effort and thing a stand alone rated R back story was absolutely what DC needed to inject life into its name.The film is about a mentally ill wannabe comedian who takes care of his physically and mentally ill mother. This man named Arthur Fleck, has sporadic bursts of uncontrollable laughter, a failing and non existent love life, and is a social outcast who gets bullied and abused. Fleck begins a violent and deranged quest to becoming a comedian while inciting class riots throughout Gotham City. The film gives an inspired look and back story into the rise of the Batman franchises most notorious super villain.I really liked the cinematography in this film Its dark yet vibrant. Joaquin Phoenix is such a tremendous actor in general and is somehow still so underrated. He is the Sam Rockwell of actors before Sam Rockwell got all that recognition a few years back. Hes fantastic in this film on all fronts and his insane laugh is instantly memorable. I can see him actually getting a nomination at the Oscars if the academy is willing to honor another comic book film with a portrayal of the Joker once again.I definitely saw the parallels to Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. The premise is actually quite similar to that of King of Comedy, and even features Robert DeNiro who was the deranged comedy fan in the Scorsese flick. Its no mistake that he's in this film. I also liked that the film did not shy away from violence and embraced its rating. Its a good ride throughout and was quite an entertaining watch.Now the social commentary. The film definitely does act on parallels seen today. Health care crisis, crime, mental illness, and class wars is something that is ever present. As a matter of fact I think this was a bold portrayal of mental illness. Sometimes there's no sense to the actions of the individual. Which brings me to some of the perceived criticisms. I understand about the Aurora theater shooting years ago, but to bash the film just because of the violence it may or may not cause isn't fair. A lot of critics also didn't understand the Joker character. This isn't going to be a very coherent descent into madness, that's not how the character or mental illness works.I also saw the lamest critique being not enough strong female characters. Come on, not every film is going to be a feminist battle. Picking too hard and too deep. I can understand not liking the film but we need better arguments as related to social justice than to just align this film with it. Also a lot of the commentaries is super guesswork. You are just making connections to the (weird) incel community and mass shootings. I don't see the film as being a defense of that or glorifying it. This is a dark and different adaptation of a beloved villain that echoes with modern times.I think the most satisfying part of the film is knowing that a successful Batman franchise film was created without even featuring Batman or even mentioning the name. Its a stand alone prequel that works so well and gives a breath of fresh air into a character who has been done many times before. I won't go into comparisons into whose Joker is best but I'm glad we get to see Phoenix's insanely dark presentation of the character.8/10",8,2,4,5 October 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Kong: Skull Island (2017)
","Kong: Skull Island When I heard that a cinematic 'Monsterverse' was being planned, I got excited. I love giant monster films. There's something about a badass giant monster wrecking havoc that is so captivating. I think Godzilla (2014) was a bit slow and flawed from a storytelling perspective but the monster action scenes were fantastic and its really all you can ask for from a monster film. As expected its more or less the same deal with Kong: Skull Island. Its a flawed film but the monster scenes and the action is terrific.The film follows a team of people who have been hired to explore the mysterious Skull Island. What the crew do not realize is that they have disturbed a giant inhabitant of the island: King Kong. Much like with Godzilla, Kong is a bit of an antihero. There are more dangerous creatures on Skull Island and Kong is a protector against them. The main foes in the film are giant lizard-like beings that kill whatever is in their way and are at war with King Kong. Much like other monster films, humans are caught in between. For my review, I will start with all the negatives before divulging into the positives. ï»¿ The characters in this film for the most part suck. They are bland, muted, unmotivated and just are there without much characterization. The ones with a bit of character (John C. Reilly) are fed uninspiring dialogue. The humorous moments are predictable and fall flat. Brie and Tom didn't have much chemistry and both characters were so bland and could have disappeared without notice. Its a relatively unknown director at the helm of this Kong film, I think he did a good job but the film would have prospered with a better script, characters, and direction. At times (not that often) the CGI looks ropy at best and its distracting (especially with the non Kong creatures).Now the positives. Every scene with Kong in it is captivating and mesmerizing. There's more of Kong in this than say Godzilla in the 2014 reboot, which is nice. You don't want to overdo the monster presence and this film just had it right. The final battle between Kong and the skull crawler was fantastic. If you love monster films and blockbuster action sequences, prepare to be on the edge of your seat. Kong took a while to get used to but overall he looked great, had great visuals, and a nice roar. The poster scene with helicopters flying at Kong against the backdrop of the setting sun was incredible.The film is flawed for sure. The human moments aren't very inspiring, its hard to connect with any of the characters, and there's a bit too many bland characters running around. However, if you are like me you are here for some epic monster v monster action and in that regard you will not be disappointed. I'm excited with the prospect of a Monsterverse. Also, stay tuned after the credits for something really great.7.5/10",7,9,15,11 March 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Murder on the Orient Express (2017)
","I remember enjoying Sidney Lumet's original adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel. It felt long, but was thoroughly entertaining. The remake had me slightly intrigued. Mostly because it had a really good cast to boot. I'm not the biggest fan of Kenneth Branagh's directional efforts, though I quite liked the live action Cinderella remake. With this film, we have a rather dull and uninspiring effort that does little to warrant its creation. It looks nice but feels like a wasted effort.The film follows 'the greatest detective in the world' Hercule Poirot as he is stranded on a train with other passengers. One night a murder occurs as one of the passengers is stabbed to death. It is up to Poirot to find out who committed the crime, while realizing the passengers on the train may not be as random and innocent as they seem. Branagh both directs and takes the lead role of Poirot in the film.That's kind of where the problem lies. Branagh as Poirot takes center stage, and its a little too centered. There is a real talented cast here, that is not much more than background characters with limited material. Judi Dench is in the film and is rarely involved with screen time. I think Branagh is good as Poirot but the film kind of plods along and doesn't garner enough interest or shock as it goes along. The film feels like it just states the plot without delivering it for the audience.The film remains quite faithful to the novel and is closely similar to Lumet's adaptation. I wanted more liberties taken to provide for a worthy and innovative adaptation but I can understand why it isn't that way. The film does not make use of its potential, and is an inferior adaptation of the novel. The visuals and picture is prim and proper but the film derails along the way which is unfortunate.6/10",6,0,4,11 November 2017
Arrival," Arrival (2016)
","I think I get swept away with the hype I've seen from others because I thought this was slightly disappointing. Not a bad film but I wanted better. The film starts off very well, I got a great sense of grief and something foreboding and the excellent score and build really helped with that. Just about the time of the reveal and on I think the pace of it dropped. I appreciate the language aspect/symbol element of what went on but it was long and not always interesting. I liked the end though. Without going into detail of what happened the film's form of narrative is worth praising especially as the credits roll. Pacing is not always perfect in the film. Sci-fi lovers will probably love this film but I think its predecessors do it better. Definitely worth a watch but not over the moon about all of it. Denis Villeneauve is excellent at setting a dark and inquisitive atmosphere in this film much like some of his previous work. I'd still say Enemy is his best effort but I look forward to seeing his next outing.7/10",7,0,5,8 December 2016
Parasite," Parasite (2019)
","There is a real insurmountable hype surrounding Bong Joon-ho's latest film. Playing only in one theater in NYC and it was sold out all weekend. Luckily, I was able to go see an early showing of this film on my day off. The hype is real. I enjoyed this film and was glued to the screen for the entire duration of the film. Its, funny, smart, violent, and socially timely. Whatever, you do please go see Parasite as it is going to be one of the best films of the year and is one of my favorites already.The film is about a poor family who live in a shabby basement and need money and struggle to survive. An opportunity comes for the son of the family as he forges documents and gets a job as a private tutor for a very wealthy family. Soon the rest of his family begin setting up situations where each of them get hired for the family. The family keep their identities hidden but soon come across dark situations and they must go to great lengths to protect their secret and their new found wealth.Bong Jonon-ho's films are usually very well shot and there is no difference here. Everything is so pristine and each small detail tells a story. The script for this film is a mix of comedy and thriller and it works so well. The leading family in this film are desperate and in poverty so you want to identity with them but then you realize that this family do some terrible stuff for their own greed, even if it means hurting innocent people.The film goes into the depths of exploring class differences and the gap between the wealthy and poor. It doesn't matter the country, this is just ever present everywhere. Its underlying and subtle at first but the theme resonates, especially through the patriarch of the family, portrayed by Song Kang-ho. I'm trying to find something to criticize about the film but am struggling to find things I didn't like. It is a fairly long film but it zooms by because of how entertaining it truly is.This is of course the final season of the year and Oscar season is in full swing. Parasite should really be up there with a Best Picture nomination and I'd say is a strong contender for being the best film of the year. Its so mesmerizing in all regards. I might need to check out more South Korean films as I greatly appreciated Burning last year. I'm gonna reiterate, go and see this film.8.5/10",8,1,4,15 October 2019
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman (2017)
","While the DC Extended Universe has been much maligned (quite understandably), Wonder Woman seemed to be the great hope in the universe. I didn't hate Batman v. Superman as much as everyone else seemed to hate it, but the film was very flawed and could have been way better. For me, the best part of that film was the introduction of Wonder Woman to the film world. People wanted to criticize Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman before they even got to see her. I've heard it all from 'she's a no name actress' to 'she's not busty enough for the role.' Having now seen Wonder Woman I think those arguments has to be put to rest as she brings the character to life and completely embodies Wonder Woman.The film is an origin story of Wonder Woman. We first find out how Diana of Themyscira came to be. We learn of the land of Amazons and how one day a pilot crashing into the island (played by Chris Pine) would change her life forever. She leaves with him, in a backdrop of European World War I, to London in order to find Ares (God of War) to end the war and the evilness of man. While her mission may sound ludicrous, it turns out she's not far off from the truth in what she seeks. Along the way she comes to grips with her power, her love for Steve Trevor, and what she must to do to stop the war and end suffering.I'm quite a fan of Wonder Woman. I don't always read up on comics but I've followed what I can WW wise. I watch the show with Lynda Carter on a weekly basis and have tried watching as many animated DC films with Wonder Woman as a can. I was pleased with this addition to the universe of Wonder Woman. Its the first good DC universe film (since it started with man of Steel). You won't see dark, somber tones and colors here. This film is pretty vibrant and light hearted when it can be. The period set design is excellent for a comic book film, sort of reminiscent of Captain America: The First Avenger.The cinematography is excellent especially at the beginning. Seeing the beautiful world of Themyscira is a joy to behold. It pops right onto the scene. For the most part the action scenes are filmed very well. I can't think of too many issues. My main gripe was the villain of the film feeling like it was shoe-horned in just to make everything more convenient. The film is quite long so the middle passage has to do a lot with getting introduced to the team that Trevor has assembled. I also think I missed how her hero costume came to be? There also isn't enough exposition and exploration into Doctor Poison or General Ludendorff; the film could have definitely benefited from more of that.I thought there was good chemistry between the two leads which makes the silly and humorous moments between them work. It's spectacular to watch Wonder Woman in action. Gadot looks great kicking butt and she completely absorbs the screen and your mind with every bullet she deflects and every giant leap she takes. The film isn't without flaws but its definitely the first good to great DC Universe film. We finally get to see Wonder Woman in full glory and power on the big screen. If you've been toiling through BVS and Suicide Squad in disappointment, I think you will really like this. Its a great entry by Patty Jenkins who should really helm the sequel.8.5/10",8,2,7,4 June 2017

","I'm a very big Stanley Kubrick fan. 2001 may be my favorite film of all time. As a fan I decided to check out some of Kubrick's earlier work. And here is Paths of Glory. An anti-war film that tells the story of men who are wrongfully sentenced to death during WWI. There are so many political and social elements in the film, and Kubrick was excellent in detailing it. A very thought provoking film that shows takes you inside a ridiculous circumstance where people lose their rights. Kirk Douglas delivers a fine performance in the film. George Macready is riveting as the antagonist. Paths of Glory is right up there with some of the best war films.8.5/10",8,0,1,26 July 2012
1408," great film
","I went into the theaters knowing I would get my moneys worth, and I ended up getting more than expected. The story is just awesome, now I never read the short story by Stephen King but I am sure those who read it will believe the movie follows it well. John Cusack puts on a great performance, I just loved it. Samuel L. Jackson may not be in the movie for long, but his appearance is quite entertaining and I think he plays the role of the hotel manager very well. There are even some good laughs in this film which is surprising due to the fact that it is horror. It had good jump moments no doubt about it, and there were creepy moments that just sucked you into the movie. The film was so good that after the film, I had to search online to see if there was an actual Dolphin Hotel in New York. This film is a great one, sure this is no 'The Shining' but it is still very impressive.9/10",10,1,3,23 June 2007
Straight Outta Compton," Straight Outta Compton
","I was hyped about this film ever since I saw the trailer a few months back and finally got around to seeing it. Very satisfied with the end product. I'm a big fan of N.W.A., Ice Cube, and Dre so seeing young portrayals of them was riveting. O'Shea Jackson Jr. looks so much like young Ice Cube it is ridiculous. He had all the mannerisms and voice of his father down. The film offered a view at the creation of some of the wonderful tracks in the groups catalog like 'Fuck Tha Police', 'Express Yourself', and the title track. Its crazy to think that the group was around for a short time, yet became such an influential and iconic group in hip hop. I was very satisfied with the portrayals of the members of the groups. There is some stuff left out with events that transpired with Dre, and the more misogynistic element of N.W.A.'s music but its no biggie. Its so nice to hear some classic tracks from not only N.W.A., but the various solo efforts of the group, among other West coast acts that are featured in the film. Music biopics are usually hit or miss; I can safely say this one was a hit. Dramatic elements, the music, the rowdy atmosphere of the late 80's, and the raw energy of Compton and aggressive hip hop was all captured in this film.",8,10,47,28 August 2015
Black Panther," Black Panther (2018)
","I was actually quite surprised to see the immense hype surrounding this film. Part of me was like, yes its a Marvel Cinematic Universe film so it'll be big. The other part was like wow this is blowing away the box office and is quite the phenomenon. The final stop before Avengers: Infinity Wars so of course I was ready for it. The introduction of Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War was one of the highlights of a super hero studded action blast. Overall, I quite liked what I saw here. Its not mind blowing and nowhere near the best the MCU has had to offer, but its a welcome addition to the Universe and is a good vehicle stand alone for a superhero who deserves it.The film takes place slightly after the death of T'Chaka, and T'Challa (his son) becoming the new King of Wakanda and becoming the new Black Panther. Wakanda is a nation that seems third world to outsiders but the nation is actually thriving in science and technology because of its abundance of vibranium. However, outside forces are made aware of this and T'Challa's throne and kingship is challenged. The film has an absolutely wonderful cast at its helm. Boseman, Jordan, Nyong'o, Kaluuya, to name a few. Visually, I think this film is on par with the best Marvel has to offer. The futuristic and scenic display of Wakanda just pop on to the screen. Boseman does well as a soft spoken yet unmistakable leader of his kingdom. I really like the Michael B. Jordan and Ryan Coogler collaboration and it works once again here. Killmonger is a good villain and its easy to rate him highly among the other MCU villains we have seen. Letitia Wright is also a real highlight of the film and likely has a bright future ahead of her.Something else that really sticks out for me is the costume design in the film. Black Panther probably has the sleekest and best looking suit in the Marvel film universe. Add to that the suits capabilities. That whole absorb kinetic energy only to redeliver it moments later onto foes is so cool. A lot of the lore of what is capable in Wakanda with vibranium is really eye catching and does well to add to the mystique of the nation.Some of the film feels formulaic though. Also, there aren't many gripping shocking moments, as the films plot unfolds into a predictable place. The action set pieces are quite nice, although the final battle is a tad bit disappointing. The mix of traditional African music and modern hip hop for the soundtrack/score was a bit off putting as well. I don't have that many complaints about the film but its also missing a bit of the awe factor that other films like Thor: Ragnarok and Civil War were able to bring.All in all, I'm glad a lot of people have been praising Black Panther and have felt really inspired by an African hero. I have to say though I think its not in that upper echelon of Marvel films, but is still quite a respectable entry into the Universe. I'm ready to see Black Panther and his Wakandan allies in the Infinity Wars. Ryan Coogler is officially three for three in solid films. Pretty content with this film.7/10",7,4,9,19 February 2018
Mother!," Mother! (2017)
","I am pretty mixed on Darren Aronofsky as a filmmaker. I absolutely love both Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan, both are excellent. The rest though, are pretty eh. Noah was probably my least favorite of his, so I was excited to see if Aronofsky could reach back for another great film. The trailer's do not reveal much but I do like Jennifer Lawrence so wanted to catch this on its premiere day regardless. After watching, I have to say its pretty hard to unpack or explain what I just saw but I know I did have an enjoyable time.The film shows two people who don't have names but are referred to as Mother and Him. They live in a remote house and seemingly have a lovely quiet life at first. She takes care of the house while he struggles to write. One day a mysterious man played by Ed Harris stops by and stays over. Later he is joined by his wife. It's hard to share much more without giving away major spoilers but lets just say things quickly become crazy afterwards. Aspects of the film will start not to make sense although I'm sure there is an allegorical meaning to everything Aronofsky does.The footage is grainy giving a rusty feel. Lawrence is really good. Say what you want, she puts in a quality effort. The camera is very personal, always close to her face. She does well to emote the bizarre horror and confusion about the situations she's placed in. Michelle Pfeiffer also puts forth quite a performance as a shady, bitchy, sex crazed wife with seemingly dark tendencies. The film has virtually no score but the film is still able to reverberate.I found this film to have the look and feel of Rosemary's Baby at first with the situation and dark nature of mystery surrounding the strangers. Its still an apt comparison and I think the film is definitely influenced by Polanski's work but Aronofsky puts his own spin on his meaning, especially in the second half. There is an allegorical connection between the film and mother earth and how we reap and rampage and destroy something so pure. There are also biblical connotations that I feel I'll need to have a rewatch for before trying to analyze what's happening. There is also a commentary on idolization and the expansive nature and danger of it.My theater crowd mostly seemed to hate it but I appreciated what I saw. Its not the best from Aronofsky and doesn't rank among the aforementioned quality films of his, but its quite ambitious as you would expect it to be. I don't know if many will understand how to interpret the latter parts of this film but the joy is in trying. While the film isn't anything amazing, its one of those that will have you thinking and will polarize its viewers. Somehow, I know that's what Aronofsky wanted.7/10",7,3,14,16 September 2017
Creed II," Creed II (2018)
","Like any other film fanatic, I have seen all the Rocky films. The films are formulaic and predictable yes, but they are good fun with enough heart to keep the series going. I did like Ryan Coogler's Creed, though not as much as many others. Still, it showed a fresh new take on the Rocky series and worked through a series of good performances and continuing the legacy of Apollo Creed through his son. I wasn't sure about a sequel without Coogler behind the camera but honestly I don't think Creed II skips a beat. its predictable and goes the route of Rocky IV but still fun to watch.The film is about the son of Ivan Drago, Viktor and his rise in the boxing scene. he makes a wave and challenges Adonis Creed for the title. Creed has a lot going on, including a baby on the way and a falling out with his coach over the fight, Rocky Balboa. Still, Creed faces off against his toughest challenge yet in Drago, a merciless fighter who looks to hurt his opponents and ultimately avenge the loss to Rocky that his father endured over 30 years ago.Without any surprise, the actual boxing fight scenes are terrific. People watching in the cinema felt every blow that Creed endures and throws. The film has a long running length which focuses on Creed's rehab and trying to get things with his family and friends right which may bother some and be formulaic but I think its done with taste and still manages to pack a punch with its heart. Michael B. Jordan is clearly one of the biggest stars going today and he doesn't miss a beat in this sequel.The film feels like a sequel and just feels like it has lower stakes then the first but entertains in the fight portions which is enough to make it a good film. I'd measure it quite closely with the first Creed and think it will be as profitable. Not that mad that this series is spawning off the Rocky series because so far it is working. Just don't go the route of Rocky V and we will be good.7.5/10",7,1,3,25 November 2018
The Greatest Showman," The Greatest Showman (2017)
","Alas, the holiday season is upon us and with that the holiday season of films. A nice mix of buzzworthy films and Oscar hopefuls, this time of year is wonderful for cinephiles. I was mildly interested in checking this film out because it looked like a capable musical. After La La Land, you had to expect more musicals attempting to emulate that film's success. I have no problem with that, I have plenty of time for all times of films. The Greatest Showman stumbles on problems with its script and storytelling but make no mistake about this film having a glorious soundtrack and fantastic production and set design.The film is (apparently a rather loose) telling of the story of P.T. Barnum and his struggle to make something for himself and his family. His initial idea of a museum isn't a success but he get's the idea of an innovative form of entertainment involving unique individuals with rare talents formerly shunned as outcasts of society. Yes, this becomes the modern day circus. I don't know exactly how truthful this is to the original story but I sensed that this film is heavy on dramatization and made things more peachy and roses than they might have been.The plot is thin, there isn't a whole lot of development of side characters and you will feel like this film falls short ass a well written musical, like that of La La Land. It's well written in the sense that the songs in the film are quite excellent. Catchy, elegant, and near impeccable in sound , the soundtrack roars and impresses. The same has to be said about the choreography, the dance numbers, costume design, and the glitz and glamor of the early 90's and the grand circus theme. Its honestly a visual and sonic experience that's worth the watch alone.I also liked the fact that this film doesn't overstay its welcome with an under two hour running length. It sort of zooms by and perhaps could have added more meat to its bare story but I'll take that over a long and dreary musical that becomes dull because of its length. The Greatest Showman may get lost in the award season shuffle but it does its job of being a fun time.7/10",7,7,18,21 December 2017
Pitch Perfect 3," Pitch Perfect 3 (2017)
","I am an Anna Kendrick maniac, so it goes without saying I'm always going to watch anything she's in. I did quite like the first Pitch Perfect. The music and a capella were good and the film was entertaining. The sequel wasn't very memorable, few moments here and there but not enough to be considered a good film. The trailer for the third film didn't look amazing but I was interested in seeing how the film series would end. The addition of Ruby Rose caught my eye as well. Overall, the film has good music and performances but does little to give the series a good send off.The Bellas are now older all with jobs they hate. They relish the opportunity to sing together once again. So, they decide to go on a USO tour where other rival bands use instruments instead of just harmonizing with their voices. Becca also must decide if she wants to pursue her dream of a musical career without the Bellas. Of course, there are also other sideplots. This film is pretty much billed as the last Pitch Perfect and yet its actually a really weak ending; one that goes out on a whimper.The writing for this one is unfocused. The competitive nature of the series is present at first but fades away as it mixes with a villainous ransom plot. It becomes a real mess when the film tries to over plot it self. The Fat Amy jokes never worked and they don't here either. Its actually probably the weakest film in the trilogy and is further proof that we only needed one Pitch Perfect. The music and singing is top notch as usual and is unsurprisingly the best the film has to offer.I couldn't help but feel that the film was just unnecessary and tired. Ideas were short and the film seems to exist just to complete a trilogy. Much like the second the musical performances are great but its hard to find anything else to really praise. The first half of the film is failed by the poor writing in the second. Also, no one ever needs that much DJ Khaled. In the case of this series, I really hope this is it and Pitch Perfect is done.6/10",6,3,7,23 December 2017
Jojo Rabbit," Jojo Rabbit (2019)
","Before Thor: Ragnarok, there was What We Do In The Shadows. A very funny and wonderfully written mockumentary following the lives of a group of vampires. Thor: Ragnarok was definitely the best Thor film and is one of the more entertaining additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I know we would have quality and good humor from Taika Waititi's newest film and was hyped for it. A comedic take on Nazis and an imaginary Hitler? Count me in. I ended up liking this more than I thought I would especially in the third act.The film is about a young German boy living in Nazi Germany. He talks to his imaginary friend, an eccentric Adolf Hitler and wants to learn how to become tougher. He discovers that his mother is actually anti-Nazi and is hiding a teenage Jewish girl in a secret wall of their house. Initially, Jojo (the main character) is resistant to her because of the Nazi philosophy he has been taught but soon he becomes compassionate towards her and even loves her. However, her livelihood is at stake especially at a time where the Gestapo actively search for hidden Jews.I'd love to praise the performances in this film. I think all around there is excellence. Each character works in their dramatic and comedic element. The film is funny as I thought it would be. Waititi has proven to be excellent in penning humorous work. However, what shocked me most was the level of emotion and humanity that the film deals with, and its done so well. Its a tough line that the film has to balance itself on. Its subject matter involves the darkest time in human history and yet the film takes a comedic approach to it and to one of the vilest figures in history, Hitler. This is no easy task, but Waititi does it and brings the quality.I liked this a lot more than I thought it would and felt like the relationship between Jojo and Elsa was just so beautiful. The humor is at times dark but always witty and I just found it to be a joy to laugh along with it. I'm glad I went out of my way to see this as I think its a memorable effort and one that I can't wait to look back on. Its a film that deals with balancing emotions and its just done well.7.5/10",8,7,23,20 October 2019
Midway," Midway (2019)
","Say what you will about Roland Emmerich, he knows how to make a large scale action film, especially if its a disaster movie. The plot and story may not always be up to par with the popcorn action scenes are almost always there. That's kind of what I expected with Midway, although the backdrop for this film is more fact based as it covers the infamous battle of Midway. The film is very long and the story is so dull. There's very little emotional value behind the characters and there's just too many packed in.The film is based on the World War II Battle at Midway between American and Japanese soldiers. The event was a result of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor six months prior. The film follows key soldiers involved in the aerial and naval warfare that ultimately led to victory for the American Forces. The film has a plethora of actors in roles throughout the film, with Mandy Moore being the only notable female character?There's a large ensemble cast at hand here. You see actors and then they disappear. A lot of them don't have good development and are there for their star power. Not sure if it was because the presentation of the story was dull or if the plot and characters just feel convoluted but I found myself checking the clock. Granted the wartime action is great to look at; something that never lets you down in Emmerich films is the action set pieces and its no different here.I did like that Emmerich also focuses on the Japanese soldiers and not just as faceless enemies. There's humanity to the characters which was a good touch, despite the American soldiers being very generic themselves. I wasn't expecting a whole lot so its not like I was let down by this. You just kind of know what you are getting yourself into with films like these. Maybe the film needed a little cheese and relationship drama like that of Pearl Harbor because that film was infinitely more entertaining. This is a by the numbers, going through the motions film, with pretty action sequences.5.5/10",6,0,2,10 November 2019
Life," Life (2017)
","The space genre is booming and on top of that we've had a number of close contained space horror films. Alien really popularized this type of film and since then we've had a number of good and some terribly bad films of the sort. The trailer for Life didn't spark a lot of interest for me as it seemed too generic, however some of the review for it were quite good so I was interested to check it out. The film is solid, despite not really offering anything new or overly original to the space horror genre.The film is about a space crew who come into contact with a life form from Mars. Although the world and space crew are initially excited about the contact that was made, it is soon discovered that this mysterious life form (named Calvin) is dangerous and smarter than initially thought. Calvin starts killing off the space crew one by one and becomes bigger and more dangerous as the crew scramble to try to kill the life form and save their space station.The film isn't exactly original and you can kind of see where it is heading, however the film does provide thrills and keeps you entertained throughout. The film benefits from having a pretty excellent cast, Gyllenhaal and Ferguson especially. Calvin is a menacing villain and you do want to see that sucker get destroyed but you have to stand by and which as it becomes stronger and stronger and more invincible. There is a long take and the cutting in the film is good for a space film and is sufficient enough for depicting thrilling moments. I really liked the ending of the film, its shockingly great and has potential for a future.As far as Venom connection goes, yes stock footage was used in the trailer from Life and Spiderman 3 and the writers of Life did write a script for a Venom film. However, I think maybe its a coincidence. I wouldn't be bothered by this actually being a horrifically brutal origin story for the symbiote that is Venom. Honestly, the studio could reel it in later and use it to lead into the Venom film that is supposedly planned. Life still works just as well as a stand alone film, prequel or not prequel.7/10",7,1,5,3 June 2017
Heat," Heat (1995)
","Michael Mann is a fine filmmaker worth getting excited over when he releases a new film. Granted, he's had a few misfires in his career but he often gets a film so right. Case in point: Heat. I had to recently go out and get the two disc re-release of this film on Bluray because its honestly a classic and something that every cinephile should have. A heist thriller starring two of the greatest actors of all time in Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, what more could you ask for? The film is about a thief Neil McCauley and his various acts of crime involving a team, which involves robbing banks and settling scores violently with enemies. On the other hand, Vincent Hanna is a detective that is endlessly hunting McCauley down. We get a wonderful game of cat and mouse and plenty of action to boot. Both Pacino and DeNiro previously collaborated in The Godfather II, but weren't really on screen together. In this film the two leads are on screen together for a limited amount of time but boy is it fantastic.I don't have many complaints for the film. The characters are well thought out, the film is inherently simple but the delivery is complex but quite structured. DeNiro/Pacino deliver in their performances. As a matter of fact I'd say this is collectively one of their last great films (as they both have had career downturns shortly afterwards). I'd say the only negative I can draw out is ropy graphics in two scenes that involve a backdrop of the city. Otherwise, its really clutching at straws to find any negatives.The film has has a few other stars of the time littered throughout the film which is pretty awesome. Its one of the few Val Kilmer films that is genuinely good! Its sad that we couldn't get another DeNiro/Pacino film while they were in their prime (to no ones surprise Righteous Kill was disappointing). This was the best Michael Mann effort and a very fine film that I'm sure was influential for films that came after. You can't really be a movie buff if you haven't seen this one.8/10",8,0,2,13 May 2017
Green Book," Green Book (2018)
","Well its hard to ignore that this looked like Driving Miss Daisy with the races of the characters reversed. It was also hard to ignore that Peter Farrelly along with his brother, is normally known for bringing often crude comedy films. While Green Book does have a ton of humor it was definitely a step in a different direction and a true story to adapt at that. I'm amazed at how much I liked this film. Every minute of this film is thoroughly enjoyable and it touches on every emotion.The film is about a loud mouth Italian American named Tony Lip who gets a job driving and being protection for a jazz pianist named Don Shirley. Initially, it is seen that the two come from different worlds and are at odds with each other but as time goes on and the two realize how different race relations are in the south, they begin to bond and become closer than they expected they would. Starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in the title roles.The film has a lot of laugh out loud moments. Especially through the eccentric nature of both leads. Whether its Tony's hard headed but uncultured nature or Don's particularities , the chemistry between the two is really off the charts. The film touches on many important concepts that still reverberate today, mainly in race relations and acceptance of sexuality. Farrelly and the real life son of Tony Lip do such a fine job writing a film that knows when to be funny and when to be serious.I think the performances from both leads is also fantastic. We are about done with the year and I don't really care what other people say this should be getting nominations is a few categories at the Academy Awards. Was really surprised at how good this film was, as the trailers don't really show off the true excellence that this film was capable of. Urge everyone to go see it, about as good as a buddy road film will be.8/10",8,27,55,18 November 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017)
","The highly anticipated sequel to a very popular action film has arrived. John Wick as sort of a sleeper hit that came out of nowhere and really blew a lot of peoples minds. I wasn't the biggest fan of the film but it was a solid action film that was very sleek and really established Keanu Reeves as an action hero. If you have any doubts about his credibility as an action star, you should probably see John Wick: Chapter 2.This time, no one kills John Wick's dog. Thank god. Wick is visited by a gangster who wants Wick to serve him because of a blood oath taken years ago. When Wick refuses, his house gets blown up. Wick then goes out for revenge and must face bounty hunters and a bunch of trained assassins. I'd say the sequel has more going on storywise as it involves much more involving a crime lord and the underside of what it entails. The sequel does a good job of maintaining fantastic, frenetic action with a balanced story and dialogue (or lack of it in Ruby Rose's characters instance).The film doesn't always flow strongly as characters sort of appear without question but this is an action film and you shouldn't worry too much about what makes sense and what doesn't. As you'd expect, the film is very sleek and has eye catching action. The scenes are shot with flashing neon lights and plenty of sick shooting with blood. If this is your sort of thing you will absolutely love it. The car chases and hand to hand combat scenes were fantastic. The whole exchange between Common and Reeves in the subway was just hilarious.My main complaint is that the film is longer this time and sometimes feels its length. Its not such a bad thing. This film is a really solid sequel, I may just prefer the original but its close. The action, blood, and style is really turned up in this edition and you just know we have an action star and franchise in our hands. I don't mind it, Keanu Reeves can rock the three piece suit and he's even better kicking major ass in it.7/10",7,1,6,18 February 2017
Annihilation," Annihilation (2018)
","No relation to Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, fortunately. Alex Garland really blew me away with his directional debut with Ex Machina. Was an absolutely enthralling, smart sci-fi film that worked on so many levels. Naturally, I was very excited for Annihilation when I first saw the trailer. Natalie Portman is also one of my favorite actresses and one of the top performers working today so this was something I couldn't wait to see. Having seen it, I have to say I'm still processing the film but its very good.Lena (Portman) is a biologist who goes to explore a mysterious area called 'The Shimmer' with four other women. Her husband recently came back after a year of being in the Shimmer and he has been acting and reacting oddly. Lena soon realizes that the world within the Shimmer is odd; plants and animals mutate unnaturally and the landscapes are ever changing. There's much more to talk about plot wise in this film bt I'd rather not spoil anything at all.First of all, visually this film looks great. As Garland says, its made for the big screen. I'm not that crazy about films premiering on Netflix and stuff so it sucks this film won't get an international release. Second, the film is slow but brooding and thriving in its complexities. It sort of reminded me of Arrival at certain stages. The film takes you on a visual and conceptual journey, whether you are coherently following along or not. Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh shine, as usual.I can tell a lot of people are going to write this film off as bad. I can already see that the right people are praising it and giving the film the due it deserves. Garland delivers an unflinching smart sci-fi thriller that stays with you. Its well acted and has interesting concepts that don't always make perfect sense, yet are mind bendingly entertaining. Ex Machina is a better film but Garland follows up with something close in quality. I'm certain that after a re-watch this film will get an 8 from me.7.5/10",7,10,21,24 February 2018
Incredibles 2," Incredibles 2 (2018)
","It took them 14 years to make it, but alas the sequel to the mega Pixar hit has arrived. I actually re-watched the original film the other day to refresh my memory. I have my favorite films from Pixar and while The Incredibles isn't one of them its still a very fun film with an interesting spin on the superhero genre. Brad Bird and most of the voice cast return and the sequel is already a massive box office hit for Disney. While the sequel isn't exactly necessary, its worthy enough and a fun time and is actually close in quality to the first.The film picks up exactly where the original left off. Superheros are still banned, but a new initiative attempts to get superheros widely accepted again. This means that Elastigirl is out fighting crime while Mr. Incredible has to take care of the family and attend to homely duties. However, troubles arise when a mysterious foe named Screenslaver attempts to control people to push a dangerous anti-superhero agenda. Its once again up to the family to save the day.Sequels that wait too long usually show age and don't work as well. Take Super Troopers 2 and Dumb and Dumber Too for example. There isn't really a discernible drop in quality with Incredibles 2. It hasn't missed a beat. Part of what makes this film fun is the MVP of it all, Baby Jack-Jack. His newly discovered range of powers are fun to watch and clearly provide the most laughs in the film. This was an excellent touch.Something that makes the Incredibles endearing is the focal family. They have individual quirks and personality which are fun to watch. We have superhero fatigue at times in Hollywood yet Brad Bird and Pixar makes it feel fresh. It took a while to make but there aren't too many complaints. The film brings fantastic visuals of action and a bunch of hero v. hero action. Its a worthy sequel from Pixar that does justice to its predecessor (something you can't really say about Cars). A fun time will be had for all.7.5/10",7,2,4,17 June 2018
Sin City," Sin City (2005)
","I've been meaning to rewatch this film for quite some time. I'm a massive fan of Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. The Grindhouse films that came out a few years ago was one of the greatest theater experiences I had. I recall being slightly disappointed with Sin City: A Dame to Kill For although it was still decent. After rewatching the film I feel just about the same about the first film; its a wonderful visual experience and wholly engaging.The film is based on Frank Miller's graphic novel and tells the tale of a few select characters. Themes of revenge and putting out crime are strong in this film. Its a neo-noir film shot in comic book style black and white with select color for some things (such as blood and the Yellow Bastard!). Its stylistically slick, an absolute joy to look at. The film is in noir form so we have the protagonist of each segment telling us what's going on. The film is detailed and violent. Sex blood and fighting reign supreme.The film has got a load of great characters and actors at the helm. Robert Rodriguez works with some names that he was linked with in the past. This time around I watched what I think was the extended cut of the film. Which I don't actually think was extended but rather each segment was in order with its parts and each segment had ending credits. It doesn't really change the experience of the film and is still just as enjoyable this way.I can see why Robert Rodriguez planned the sequel. His work usually do get additional films though they often end up being not up to par with the original. Unfortunately, this was the same with A Dame to Kill For. I actually would like to give a sequel a re-watch though as I may have more positive feelings about it at this time. All I know is that Robert Rodriguez should get credit for going outside the box with his work, sometimes it doesn't work but at least he attempts to be innovative.8/10",8,0,1,13 May 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Hacksaw Ridge (2016)
","Mel Gibson is a director who comes back every few years or so and just blows me away. In 2006, I was amazed by Apocalypto. I still watch that film from time to time because its so riveting, damning, and beautiful. When Hacksaw Ridge was announced I was excited. I tend to get very drawn into well made war films. I knew with Mel, I'd likely see and experience something that would be very worth the watch.The film is about the real life story of Desmond T. Doss, an army medic who refused to hold a gun or fight the opposition during World War II in the Battle of Okinawa. His bravery, resolve, and willpower to save his fellow comrades makes for such an inspiring story, if projected successfully onto the screen. Andrew Garfield has had one hell of a year. To go from the lead in the atrocious Amazing Spider-Man films to starring in a Scorsese and Mel Gibson epic; its one hell of a leap. He's faultless in this. Doss is a kind hearted simple man whose passion is to help those who are in dire need of help.We are first subjected to young Doss growing up in a rather abusive household. We get to see how Doss had become a pacifist and how he met the love of his life. There is nothing with what is seen here. Its arguably slow, however its sweet and takes you back to a love story from WWII. Its good stuff. The film just keeps getting better from here. We then see Doss during training and how his lifestyle causes his infantry to turn on him in hate and disgust. He overcomes adversity and finally gets to the Battle of Okinawa.Let me just tell you that Mel Gibson is an excellent visionary when it comes to depicting visceral action. Its completely necessary to show how a war truly is. Nothing is held back. Blood comes from everywhere, limbs fly off, guts are hanging out, heads are being blown off. Its intense but phenomenally shot. You are in the trenches experiencing the nightmare as it happens. Its the best show wartime action since Saving Private Ryan. I'm not going to lie, I came here for good war action sequences and was very impressed with what I saw.Here's a film with a few many characters and honestly they are developed decently. This is Doss' story through and through but you love the connections with the people in his unit and how they all come around on him. Doss is a hero in its finest form. Its wonderful to witness his bravery and courage through a wonderfully shot, gripping, war epic. Mel Gibson hits the mark yet again.8/10",8,3,8,19 January 2017
Alien: Covenant," Alien: Covenant (2017)
","Ridley Scott's Alien is one of the greatest sci-fi horror experiences of all time. This is generally widely accepted. The Xenomorph is also a legendary movie monster. Ridley's had a period of time where he has been shaky in bringing forth quality films. While I did enjoy Prometheus for the most part, it was most certainly flawed. It was still interesting so I was always going to check out Covenant no matter what. I'm too big a fan of the first two Alien films to not watch this. Overall, this is a decent film but I feel like its filled with many problems and questions.This film takes place after the events of Prometheus. There is a crew heading to a planet to colonize but along the way they receive a strange transmission and decide to land on the closest planet from which the transmission came from. They immediately realize that the planet is hostile and two crew members soon get immediately infected and our favorite chest bursters come through. The film is set up as a sequel to Prometheus and apparently Ridley plans to make more films to tie into the original Alien.I'm not sure how I feel about more films. This film was decent at best. The cinematography is excellent and the set design is great. You get a feel for the space adventure and also the desolate planet in ruins. The xenomorphs or neomorphs or what have you, look good for the most part. However, the initial first alien that pops out did look computerized. That entire scene should be praised though. Its horrific, gruesome, and frenetic. You are with the characters not knowing what the heck is going to happen and it all comes at you fast. Sadly, a lot of the rest isn't as fun.Its hard to care for the many characters who drudge along through a good thirty minutes of the film which become a bore. There are many characters, half of which are so underwritten. Katherine Waterston was good, a rising star who has a future as a Ellen Ripley-esque female protagonist/hero. Fassbender was also fantastic as two dueling androids. David is an eloquent villain, with a struggle for rebelling against his creators. He's actually a sadistic villain. A lot of scenes in the film feel like they were placed to pad the running time.The film doesn't always introduce anything new as the film feels like it borrows a lot from the previous Alien installments. I don't think this film is any better than Prometheus. With Prometheus we got a methodical origin story that took things slowly but was serving of introducing new concepts to the Alien universe. This one tries that with a half developed plot and then compensates the rest with sci-fi bloody violence (which I don't mind). While the action scenes won't let you down, its hard to defend a plot that just brings up more questions. I can't state any of the questions as they fall into the spoiler category. I just hope Ridley ends the Alien story soon because its not getting any better as it goes along.6/10",6,3,9,20 May 2017
