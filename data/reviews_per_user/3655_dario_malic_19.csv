The Lobster," Is this love that I'm feelin'?
","Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos has made a name for himself with strange, absurd films, so it's not unexpected that 'The Lobster' falls in the same category. The story is set in a dystopian world where all single people get sent to some sort of hotel where they have a limited number of days to find a partner or they'll be transformed in an animal of their choosing.The methods the staff at the hotel use to convince people it's better to be with someone, although shown with deadpan humour, are very disturbing and unexpectedly effective. For instance, when people arrive at the hotel one of their hands is tied up behind their backs to show them that 'everything is easier in pair'. But there's also a way to extend your stay and remain single. The nearby forest is a hiding place for a group of runaways from the hotel who the residents go out to hunt once in a while. For each successful capture they get their stay extended. It's a pretty straightforward representation of society's fight against diversity and those who don't adhere to rules, but Lanthimos doesn't stay there.In the second half of the film, when the focus moves from the hotel to the forest, we get even more rigorous rules and brutal demonstration of intolerance for those who don't follow them. It's one of director's ironical twists, but also a disturbing example of illogical and revengeful human nature. Those who were forced to find a partner formed a community in which it is forbidden to have a partner, or even just flirt. Main character proves to be an constant exception and keeps breaking the rules wherever he is and whatever they are (which brings to question whether there's any possibility for him to have a happy ending), symbolizing in that way a fight for individuality inside an oppressive system.I've wrote more about its messages and themes (although I've mentioned but a few) than about the film itself because I find them more interesting. That's not to say that the film isn't good, on the contrary. It's a film with great acting, haunting music, bleak, washed up cinematography (which perfectly suits its themes) and many standout scenes. It's just that the philosophy behind it is more impressive than what goes on on the surface. 'The Lobster' is more than meets the eye, all the way to its questioning, if not engrossing, ending.",8,44,82,30 July 2015
Skyfall," The end is the beginning
","It has been fifty years since 'Dr. No', the first James Bond movie came out, and to celebrate that anniversary we have before us twenty-third installment in the series, 'Skyfall'. For the first time in the hands of an Oscar winner (Sam Mendes), new Bond has a list of very respectable names attached to it. First draft of the screenplay was written by Peter Morgan while one of the authors of the final version is John Logan. The music is written by Thomas Newman, and Roger Deakins was handling the cinematography. The cast is surely one of the best ever, with Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Albert Finney and Ben Wishaw. And of course, there's Sam Mendes at the helm. Having liked the previous two Craig's Bond movies and looking at that list of names, I was really convinced that this could be the best Bond ever. After watching it I'm not that convinced anymore.So what's it all about? Someone stole the list with the names of every British secret agent and trying to recover it Bond went missing. It becomes obvious that whoever has the list has some personal quarrel with M. After an attack on the MI6 headquarters Bond comes back and helps M find the person behind it. It turns out to be Tiago Rodriguez a.k.a. Raoul Silva, a former MI6 operative who's after M because of some things from the past. Luckily, Bond is here to save the day. Or is he? With the arrival of Craig as James Bond, the character, as well as the series, was given a new look. Bond became vulnerable, more violent and not so well-mannered. But this time there is another change, with considering Bond's age and is it interfering with his abilities. Probably motivated by 50th anniversary and the talk of the series becoming old and redundant, the movie discusses Bond's ability as well as the ability and necessity of the whole MI6 department and shows us in the end that they still have a lot to give and we still need them. Talking of course not about just Bond and MI6 but the movie series as well. This theme is not the only thing inspired by the anniversary. In fact, there are a lot of smaller and bigger details pointing back to the series' roots. From the classic silver Aston Martin DB5 ('Goldfinger', 'Thunderball') which even has the same license plate number, and the locations in Turkey and Scotland ('From Russia with Love'), to a criminal mastermind with his own island ('Dr. No') and a little deranged personality (all of the early Bond villains). There's also a sense of going back to the roots in introducing new versions of key characters, and even the office in the end and M giving Bond a new assignment remind of old Bond movies.Alongside that with the early entries in the series, there's another parallel 'Skyfall' draws, the one with Nolan's Batman trilogy. Nolan's Batman and new Bond are both troublesome characters trying to overcome their weaknesses to do a greater good, which isn't so uncommon, but some of the similarities with 'The Dark Knight Rises' are striking. In the first place it's the relation with the main bad guy. Just like Batman and Bane, Bond and Silva share the same training and mentor. For the first it's the League of Shadows and Ra's Al Ghul, while for the others it's MI6 and M. Both Bane and Silva were discarded by their mentors which filled them with rage and both of them brought chaos to the cities of their enemies (in Gotham it's the stadium which collapses while in London it's a part of the London Underground). There's also previously mentioned issue of being too old and incapable to do what has to be done, discussed in the latest Batman movie as well. The movies even share a line foreshadowing the imminent destruction ('A storm is coming.').But this is still a Bond movie. It has great action, beautiful locations, beautiful women and a sense of humour, although not all of that to the same extent. The action really is great and the locations more than beautiful mostly thanks to Deakins's cinematography which is outstanding and deserving of his 10th Oscar nomination. Of course, credits go to Dennis Gassner's (interestingly, another frequent Coen brothers' collaborator) production design and Mendes's direction as well. The other two things I have a problem with. There are two women in the movie, aside from M of course. One of them can't really be called a standard Bond girl due to her probably continuing appearance in the series, and the other is given very little screen time, appearing and disappearing in the middle of the movie, and thus for the first time making M the most prominent female in a Bond movie. In accordance with the story, of course, but strange nonetheless. With the lack of women, but without greater meaning than to provide a comic moment, comes Bond's first homo-erotic moment, Silva touching his legs and Bond implying it would not be his first time. It gives Craig a great line, but sticks out as unnecessary in the same time making us aware of how little humour there is in the movie.Read the complete review at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",8,1,9,4 November 2012
Argo," The movie is fake. The mission is real.
","The line between fiction and reality is nowadays often blurred, with television and newspapers assaulting people with all kind of half-checked information, so it's refreshing to see a piece of work that makes clear distinction between the two. And it's even better that it does so by mixing them together.'Argo', Ben Affleck's latest effort as both, a director and an actor, is a fictional work about a real event which consisted of creating a fictional event about a work of fiction. Confused? If you've seen the movie you're not. It is all displayed so clearly that it's easy to overlook its complexity. In 1979 Iranians took hold of US embassy in Tehran as a retaliation for US sheltering their overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. They held people who were working there as captives, but 6 diplomats managed to hide in the house of the Canadian ambassador, and escaped two months later with the help of CIA exfiltration expert Tony Mendez, posing as a Canadian film crew making a (fake) sci-fi with an eastern vibe. It sounds like one of those things that could only happen in a movie, so it was a logical decision to put it there. And putting it there means crossing from reality to fiction. So a joint CIA and Canadian Government operation can become one man's quest to save his fellow countrymen, as it basically did. There are, of course, other involved, but the movie's main character is Tony Mendez. He came up with the idea, found all the people needed to do the job, and himself went to Tehran to help the diplomats escape.Affleck the director does a very good job. Although we know how it's all going to end, there's an unbearable tension and a sense of fear for the characters we feel right till the last minute. What's even more fascinating is that we're at the same time aware of the silly and clich√©d solutions utilized to create those feelings (everything happens in the nick of time) but we don't care about them. Affleck the actor isn't as good. He's mostly expressionless and makes the weakest link in the otherwise almost perfect cast. A shame considering he gets most of the screen time. Fortunately, the likes of Clea DuVall and Christopher Denham present us with some of the most intense performances we've seen in the last couple of years. Make-up, costume design and the overall production design make us go back in time as well as see and feel the differences between the east and the west, while Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography makes the fear and tension palpable with the help of great editing by William Goldenberg. There's a brilliant interchange of Iranian woman reading accusations against the US and the cast of the fake movie reading the screenplay, which displays all of it.In spite of its serious subject matter the movie contains a lot of humour, presented mostly by the two Hollywood characters and directed towards the same movie industry. And while the Hollywood gets criticized for a lot of things, it's ultimately lauded for the hope and sense of magic it brings to people whether the movie is real or fake. But, as Affleck shows us by naming his movie after the one it tells about, all the movies are actually fake. It's only their meaning and the impact they have that matter.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",8,0,0,2 December 2012
Life of Pi," To live is to think
","The latest Ang Lee movie, 'Life of Pi', is an adaptation of a beautiful prize-winning novel of the same name written by Yann Martel. For a long time the novel was considered to be unfilmable so Lee's work was awaited with reserve, but only to thrill almost everyone upon its release.'Life of Pi' is a story of Piscine Molitor Patel, or Pi as he renamed himself. Pi grew up in Pondicherry, a little town in India, where his father ran a zoo. He was a curious boy who looked for answers beyond his father's scientific approach and embraced Hindu, Christian and Muslim religions along the way. The life was sweet in Pondicherry but unfortunately, due to financial difficulties, Pi's father had to close the zoo and the family prepared to move to Canada. They were traveling on the same boat as their animals from the zoo which were sold to western buyers when a great storm hit them. After the storm came down Pi found himself as the only human survivor, in a lifeboat with zebra, hyena, orangutan and a tiger named Richard Parker. There began his true search for God, meaning and the limits of human strength.For a movie most of the time containing only one boy and a tiger to succeed, those two really had to be something special. Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, is a newcomer. A risky choice for a role so important and complex, but one that enables us to focus on the character without the distraction of a familiar face. Considering his inexperience, Sharma has done a very good job with just a few unconvincing moments. The tiger on the other hand remained flawless. It's mostly CGI with only a few scenes containing a real animal, but the CGI is incredibly lifelike and among the best I've ever seen. It gives so much depth to the tiger, making it a rounded character completely deserving of a full name.The movie was filmed in 3D which is an unusual choice for a serious drama but Lee and cinematographer Claudio Miranda made it an indispensable part of the completed work. The cinematography is mesmerizing and its effects are greatly helped by the 3D which feels so natural you simply enjoy it without even being aware it's there. The beauty of the images emphasizes the meditative nature of the story, its plot serving only as the ground for spiritual ideas to grow.The message of the movie can be interpreted in different ways. Some will say it is a religious one, but it can also be said to deny the existence of any kind of god. There's also the message about the importance of stories. The way we pick them, digest them, and the impact they have on us. Nevertheless, it's not the precise meaning Martel or Lee had in mind what's most important, but the one every person finds for oneself, for 'Life of Pi' is one of those rare movies which are not complete without someone watching them. Therefore it has as many interpretations of the story as there are those who watched it. In that way it does two of the most important things every piece of art should do, it makes you think and it makes you discuss it. If for nothing else, it should be seen because of that.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",8,1,3,7 January 2013
Coriolanus," The sacrifice of an egoist
","Ralph Fiennes, a famous British actor, recently decided to step behind the camera. For his debut he chose an adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy 'Coriolanus'. It's a story of Roman general Caius Martius and his downfall. Martius is a member of Roman high society who looks down upon common people considering them a primitive, uneducated mob. After a victory over his arch-nemesis Tullus Aufidius from the Volscian army for which he is given a title 'Coriolanus', Martius runs for Consul. But some of the tribunes don't have it in their best interest for him to be elected so they decide to use his well known contempt for people and short temper, and pit him against those who must acknowledge him as a consul, leading to his banishment from Rome. Once banished, his resentment for Rome grows so big he goes to Aufidius and offers him help in conquering the city.All of the dialogue in the movie is Shakespearean and you can easily imagine warriors in their armor with swords and shields, as well as Roman senators and tribunes walking around in their togas. But here comes the interesting part. The movie transports the story in our present (or at least some variation of it), so instead of swords we have guns and instead of senators walking around we see them driving in cars. That modern setting emphasizes the parallels with the current situation in the world, where the gap between the rich and the poor becomes wider and wider and common people complain against those in power. But the movie does something even more interesting. It shows that people, how ever smart every one of them might be, when put in a group fall under the influence of mass mentality and need guidance. The question is, is it better for them to be led by someone with sweet words but selfish mind or someone who looks on them from above but is smart and noble. It seems that Shakespeare gives us such flawed candidates on purpose, suggesting the imperfection of the world we live in and showing us we'll often have to choose between two evils.But the movie isn't just about showing us the flaws of the system or mass mentality. It also focuses on the relationship between Martius and his dominant mother Volumnia, which feels almost incestuous. There's a scene in which Virgilia, his wife, walks in on Volumnia nurturing his wounds, and withdraws with shame like she caught two lovers in the act. But the power his mother has over him, shaped Martius as a person of many contradictions and ultimately made him sacrifice himself for the city he wanted to destroy.Although the first half of the movie is filled with gunfire and explosions, it's a full-blooded tragedy with larger-than-life characters, pompous dialogues and some, presumably deliberate, overacting from Vanessa Redgrave and Ralph Fiennes in the roles of mother and son. Placing the plot in a modern setting, Fiennes adds a kind of post-apocalyptic feel to the tragedy and makes a 400 years old story feel fresh in spite of Shakespearean language. Beside Redgrave and Fiennes, I should point out Brian Cox as Menenius, one of the senators, as well as Jessica Chastain as Virgilia. The role of Aufidius is played by Gerard Butler, who, I feel, lacks the conviction of the others, and is one of the movie's weakest points.'Coriolanus' is an interesting, if not completely successful, experiment. Though the Shakespearean element can be difficult for most, it pays off once you get accustomed to it, creating a unique experience. Fiennes has done a very good job and I can't wait to see his take on Charles Dickens' life in 'The Invisible Woman'. However, I hope there won't be any machine gun fire and driving around in cars this time.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",7,2,4,11 November 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," Hey, let's be positive
","It's hard to make a good romantic comedy. There are dozens of them every year and they (almost) all recycle the same formula: guy meets girl, they fall in love but won't admit it, encounter some obstacles, and overcome them all to live happily ever after. There's often a little drama too, added to make for some serious moments, but rarely it bares any real weight. Seeing the trailer it was obvious to me that the same is the case with director David O. Russell's new film 'Silver Linings Playbook' so I wondered how can it be that the film was nominated for an Oscar in all important categories, counting the nominations to eight. I've recently watched it and stopped wondering. Sure, it has the same formula, but Russell (who also wrote the screenplay) and his cast make all the difference in the world.It's a story of Pat, a history teacher who found his wife with another man and went a little crazy. They put him in a mental institution and diagnosed him with a bipolar disorder but eight months later his mother takes him back home. He meets Tiffany, a good-looking young widow with similar problems to his, but in spite of his impulses decides to only make friends with her as the means to get his wife back. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are simply fantastic in the roles of Tiffany and Pat. After a great turn in the 'Winter's Bone' a couple of years ago, Lawrence here does completely different but equally great work showing her admirable range, and Cooper finally proves he is a serious actor after a series of comedic works of dubious quality. No less appealing are those in supporting roles. Robert De Niro (his best role in a long time) and Jacki Weaver as Pat's parents and a special treat, as Pat's friend from mental institution, Chris Tucker in his first non-Carter role in 15 years. All of them did an excellent job and it's no surprise that the film is an Oscar contender in all four acting categories.Of course, the actors needed a good material to work with as well as a guiding hand and that's were Russell strongly delivered. I didn't read the novel by Matthew Quick which the film was based on so I don't know how much of the credit goes to him but the script is great. It is rare enough seeing most of the characters in the film having some kind of mental disorder, but to see them presented so emphatically, keeping in sight that they are human beings just like the rest, but also realistically, with all their good and bad sides, was almost impossible until now. The reason for that approach is probably in the fact that Russell's son has bipolar disorder as well as OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) so he has understanding both of and for the mental disorders. His familiarity with the subject can also be felt by how he handles family relations within the film. The relations between Pat, his father and his mother are at the same time simple and complicated due to the problems they have, and they are portrayed in a way so natural and sincere you can easily imagine something like that happening just around the corner.That still leaves the clich√©d love story, but in a much better position than initially. Although we've seen it a thousand times and know how it ends, it keeps us invested and make us feel the emotions of its characters. That's because, due to sincere performances by Lawrence and Cooper, it doesn't feel contrived, and the ending we've gotten used to this time feels truly deserved.'Silver Linings Playbook' also has one more universal theme. Through showing us how those with some kind of disability deserve to be happy, it actually shows us that we all deserve it. And if we try real hard to be our best selves we have a chance at it. It's optimistic attitude is reinvigorating just as is Russell's take on the genre. After initially being surprised by its Oscar nominations, now I'll be surprised if it doesn't make at least some of them into an award. It's one of the best films of the year and I look forward to watching it again. Oh, and did I mention that Chris Tucker is in it?More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",9,3,4,25 January 2013
Batman Begins," The Fear
","With 'The Dark Knight Rises' currently in theaters I decided to revisit first two parts of Nolan's trilogy before watching the final one. Naturally I began with 'Batman Begins', watching it for at least fifth time (I can't remember the exact number, but it's one of those movies I feel a need to watch every now and then).The story of Batman was told countless times since his first appearance in a comic book in 1939 and I'll assume you all know it, at least the most important parts of it, so I won't talk about it here. It'll suffice to say the first movie of Nolan's trilogy talks about how Bruce Wayne became Batman, and more importantly - why. It tells a story of a man filled with anger and insatiable need for revenge and deciding to let it all out on the criminals. But nevertheless he draws a line he's not willing to cross. Bruce Wayne/Batman believes salvation of human race can be achieved without destroying it and isn't willing to punish the good for the sins of the bad. Which doesn't mean he's playing by the rules, of course. He's just slightly bending them to fit his moral code. Unlike him his enemies, a group known as The League of Shadows and led by Ra's Al Ghul, claim to have the same cause, getting the world rid of all the evil, but are willing to do whatever it takes and sacrifice whoever stands in their way. It's interesting to notice how those criminals he fights directly helped shape Bruce into who he becomes and therefore helped create what's to become their greatest fear, Batman. Bruce leaves Gotham to 'taste desperate' immediately after talking with crime boss Carmine Falcone, driven by his speech, and he gets inspired to become Batman after spending time with The League of Shadows and learning their ways. In a way it raises the question of the necessity of evil so we could know what is good.The question of what is justified to do in the pursuit of a greater cause is one not often talked about in superhero movies. At least not with an approach this serious. Being so, I must admit I'm a little disappointed (just a little) by Nolan's decision to define things in a (almost) standard good vs. evil way in the end. The beliefs of Ra's Al Ghul and his followers are too ambiguous to be easily marked and they are fighting for the same cause however different their methods are. In my opinion it's a theme deserving of a greater, more detailed look.Fortunately, it isn't the only interesting issue approached in this movie. The main obstacle Bruce Wayne had to overcome on its way to, not only become Batman, but make peace with his past, was one of basic human emotions. Fear. It's an emotion explored throughout the whole movie, being also the main weapon in planned destruction of Gotham City. All the main characters have a special relation to it. Carmine Falcone rules by it, psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane explores it, Ducard conquered it and Bruce learns to embrace it, which is shown in an exhilarating scene when he turns on the flashlight in a cave and gets surrounded by bats. There are also some thoughts about fear that are very insightful such as Falcone's 'This is a world you'll never understand. And you always fear what you don't understand' and even more Ducard's lesson to Bruce: '...what you really fear is inside yourself. You fear your own power, you fear your anger, the drive to do great or terrible things.' I don't know when something resonated more with me and so openly exposed the truth we keep hidden from ourselves.So it's a movie about overcoming your fears, learning to forgive yourself and carry on, finding that fine line which divides right from wrong, devoting yourself to an idea, losing yourself in one (the end of the movie questions what became Bruce's true identity and what the mask) and so many more, and it still manages to be a thrilling action ride and a visually stunning blockbuster. The movie is technically flawless, the acting as good as you expect from the talent involved (Bale, Neeson, Caine, Freeman, Hauer, Wilkinson, Murphy) and the soundtrack wonderfully complements the atmosphere created by great direction and fantastic screenplay. Still, it has some minor flaws. Gus Lewis, who plays young Bruce Wayne, isn't that convincing, and the love story between Bruce and Rachel ends up superficial. But, overall, those flaws are practically negligible.'Batman Begins' is as realistic as a superhero movie gets to be. All that appears and happens in the movie is based on human skill, technology and human psyche, excluding all forms of supernatural. It isn't necessarily a good thing but here it helped create the greatest origin story I've ever seen and set a standard for superhero movies matched only by it's sequel. So whether you are a movie lover, a fan of the comics, interested in human psyche and basic emotions, troubled by ethical questions, or just want to have fun, you should watch this movie as soon as possible. That is, if you haven't already seen it. And if you have, you probably don't need me to tell you to watch it again.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",9,0,1,4 August 2012
To Rome With Love," The Eternal Woody
","Woody Allen's latest movie, 'To Rome With Love', continues his tour around Europe (London, Barcelona, Paris) bringing us to the capital of Italy, The Eternal City. It's envisioned as a collage of four separate stories taking place in Rome. The themes which the stories explore are classical Woody. Love, fame, culture, sex, art, fear of death, insecurity and lots more. The problem is, although nearly every Allen's movie tells the same (or similar) story, they're not all equally good. And this one isn't one of his better works.The main problem I found with it was a lack of coherence. Allen jumps from story to story seemingly without any plan or structure and, as if that wasn't enough, some stories seem to unfold over a period of a week or so while other take place during one day. It gives the impression that Woody didn't care enough to put it all together in some logical way and that's disappointing. Add to that some uninspired acting (bigger part of the cast and this time even Woody himself), unsuccessful recycling of his previous work (Woody again, that is, his character) and a sketch-like feel of the movie, and you could think Allen' s time has passed.Fortunately, the movie has its bright spots too. A sketch with a man who can only sing under the shower turns out to be hilarious when his son's father in law Jerry (Allen) puts on a version of 'Pagliacci' with a shower cabin in the center of the stage. One more thing which should be noted about that segment is Judy Davis playing Jerry's wife. It's been a while since she starred in an Allen movie (almost fifteen years) and she's great fun to watch here so I hope we'll see her again soon. There's also Penelope Cruz, whom it's always nice to see, playing a prostitute teaching a young provincial boy a trick or two and improving what is one of weaker movie segments along the way (although not considerably). But the best acting is seen in the only segment which feels like it has a story. Jesse Eisenberg plays a young architect living in Rome with his girlfriend but slowly falling for her friend played by Ellen Page. There's also Alec Baldwin in a now I'm here/now I'm not/am I even real? kind of role, but I'm gonna leave that one for you to figure out. Eisenberg and Page are fantastic. They both play more or less typical Allen's characters but this time those characters are unusually young which makes them even more interesting. Jack (Eisenberg) falls for Monica (Page) even though he knows he can't have a serious relationship with her and gets swept off his feet with her smart remarks and quotations although he knows she's a fake (or, as Allen wonderfully put it, a con artist). Monica (who's an actress) on the other hand seems to fake everything but does it with so much sincerity that you can't help getting intrigued by her, and the credit for that goes to Page.In Allen's latest movies cities turn out to be one of the main characters and I expected that here too, but didn't get it (I don't know if it was supposed to be that way at all though). There are few sightseeing shots but for most of the movie you couldn't say if it is happening in Rome or any other Mediterranean city, which suggests that the movie didn't live up to it's title. Nevertheless, it seems the combination of Woody Allen and Europe simply can't completely fail. The movie has its charm, not diminished by any of its flaws, and is pleasant to watch. But why am I writing so much? In my experience there are two groups of people, those who love Woody Allen and those who don't. The second ones probably won't bother to read about an Allen movie, and those belonging to the first group know they're gonna watch every new Woody Allen movie no matter what. And that's perhaps Allen's greatest accomplishment.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",6,0,2,7 September 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Into the realm of technology
","I must admit I'm not a loyal fan of either J.R.R. Tolkien's or Peter Jackson's work. I've read 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy long time ago, and haven't even finished watching Jackson's adaptations. I found both books and movies fun and good but nothing more. Therefore I wasn't very excited when news of 'The Hobbit' adaptation finally came. Even less promising was an announcement that the book will be adapted as a trilogy of movies. Decision to go and see the first one (titled 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey') nevertheless was motivated almost entirely by the 48 fps in which Jackson decided to film it, and in the end I'm not that sorry for it.The story of 'The Hobbit' is already known by everyone, young and old alike, so there's no need to go into it in detail. A young Hobbit by the name of Bilbo Baggins joins thirteen dwarfs and a wizard named Gandalf on a quest to kill a dragon and reclaim the lost dwarven kingdom. That's the basic outline. The problem is there isn't much more to it. As we can expect, the journey can't pass without difficulties, so the merry bunch gets attacked by trolls, goblins and orcs only to be saved by the wizard over and over again, very much like in the LOTR trilogy. But this time it all happens in a dissimilar manner. Instead of creating tension, a feeling of urgency, or any sense of peril, Jackson mostly decided on comedic approach. Thus the dialogues are comedic even when the characters are in great danger as is the way they behave. This, of course, is not the case in all of the situations, but it's present enough to make apparent Jackson's intention of bringing the movie closer to a younger audience. The intention is also apparent in the esthetics of some scenes which resemble video games, like the battle of stone giants or the escape from the Goblin lair. In fact, the whole movie is made similar to a video game, introducing and forming the party in the beginning and then venturing from one battle to the other, occasionally resting on safe ground (Rivendell).All those things orienting the movie towards youngsters are in fact nothing bad. We mustn't forget that the book was written for children in the first place. What is a little disappointing though is that Jackson obviously didn't have the adults in mind at the same time. The movie has some unnecessary flashbacks and story arcs which may prove too complicated for the youngest to understand while simultaneously being too blunt and shallow for the older audience. Those could have been replaced with some real characterization and meaningful dialogue, or at least left out to give a greater sense of urgency, considering the deadline the characters have. There is also too much dependency on LOTR with the reappearance of the old Bilbo, Frodo, Saruman, Galadriel and Elrond, most of which are completely redundant. It's clear that Jackson wants to connect the trilogies as much as possible, it just isn't as clear why. Although, with a classic trilogy behind us and a first part of a prequel trilogy aiming for children, something smells conspicuously like an inside of a tauntaun here.In spite of all the minuses I've mentioned (or maybe even because of them), the movie is fun. It's a three-hour-long ride through the land of Middle-earth featuring great comedic performances by Martin Freeman as Bilbo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and all of the thirteen actors playing the dwarfs, as well as the always fantastic Andy Serkis as Gollum. Cinematography, production design, costume design and makeup, as well as the visual effects are all on a level expected of a movie this big, and enriched by the always great Howard Shore's music. The young will probably love 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' as well as the fans of the book and the whole LOTR franchise or those who would like to visit the Middle-earth once again. So if you belong to any of those go to the nearest movie theater and let the journey begin.P.S.I've mentioned that I've watched the movie practically only because of the frame rate in which it was shown, so I feel obliged to write a few words about it. The opinions are divided between those who are saying that it looks like a documentary about filming the real movie and those who find the frame rate more immersive. I've been skeptical about it but in the end found out I belong to the latter group. The most obvious advantage of a higher frame rate is in quick camera movements which are fluid as they simply cannot be in 24 fps. The problem is that Jackson abuses it in some scenes, inducing dizziness with all the twisting and spinning at high speed, and even the movements of the characters sometimes seem too fast. 48 fps really make the movie look more real, but not in the bad way. The additional frames help the world of Middle-earth and all that inhabits it feel more palpable, as though it really exists, and they even do so more than the (really good) 3D. No doubt Jackson needed a capable crew and a big budget to make everything feel like an actual thing instead of a prop but he largely succeeded. There are probably some things which could've been done better, but it's a fantasy movie, needing much more to create an illusion of genuineness. I can't wait to see some present-set story filmed in such way. 48 fps make a more immersive visual experience than 3D and with immersiveness being the current goal, my guess is that Jackson just set a new standard.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",7,1,3,8 January 2013
Lincoln," The simplicity of greatness
","I don't know many details about Abraham Lincoln's presidency so I came into 'Lincoln' unburdened by historical facts. There were some expectations though, considering the director is Steven Spielberg, and they ended up completely fulfilled. The film begins in the midst of the Civil War and follows Lincoln's attempt to bring an end to it, as well as to slavery, and the difficulties he faced doing it, ending with his death after the assassination at Ford's Theatre.The real focus of the film is on Lincoln's battle with slavery. While most of the other politicians just wanted the war to end, he postponed the peace arrangements, risking their failure, in order to get the thirteenth amendment (which abolishes slavery) passed by the United States House of Representatives (also known as the House). It is in itself a controversial decision and the means which he used in doing all of that are even more so. He stalled the Confederacy negotiators, made some members of his party lie about their beliefs and even bought votes from Democrats promising them better positions. It was interesting to see the most loved American president doing things for which anyone would be condemned today. The other unusual and refreshing thing to see was portrayal of the Lincoln as an ordinary man. Although (as I later learned) he came from a poor family and was mostly self-educated, it was surprising to see a man of such importance presented as a funny storytelling commoner. Of course, his decisive nature and strong leadership weren't omitted, which only contributed to the impressiveness of the character.Most of the credits for making Lincoln as compelling as he is nevertheless go to Daniel Day-Lewis. Once again he proved his versatility and ability to become one with the character giving a performance so minute and delicate, and at the same time so powerful that one could easily watch just him for 150 minutes (film's running time). He's aided by a brilliant cast of supporting actors including James Spader, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, John Hawkes, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jared Harris, Jackie Earle Haley and Michael Stuhlbarg among the rest. Sally Field's performance as Lincoln's wife Mary was not so good as the hype suggests but still helped keep the standard high.The technical side of the film, as was expected from Spielberg's work, is flawless. Cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), editing (Michael Kahn), production design (Rick Carter), costume design (Joanna Johnston) and of course, music by John Williams, all made the long film as easy watch as can be and a pleasing experience for both eyes and ears.Spielberg made a film about a very well known, but also a very important, character and an equally known and important episode from American history. It was a safe bet from the beginning and the screenplay from Tony Kushner, his Munich collaborator, just solidified it. However, it feels more as an exploration of the way politics work than as an ode to freedom, and the question remains whether this was Spielberg's intention. The main problem of the film is that it doesn't bring anything new. There is a little bit more humor than expected but other than that all classic Spielberg characteristics are in place: strong characters, simple plot, a touch of melodrama, great acting, impressive visuals, touching music, and so on. Unfortunately that stopped being enough some time ago.There is no doubt that 'Lincoln' is a very good film. If only Spielberg had the courage of his main character to impose a change where it is an absolute necessity it would have been great. This way we have nothing to do but to enjoy Day-Lewis' magnificent performance and hope that the great director's next film won't be just for the people but also for the history.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",8,0,1,21 February 2013
The Dark Knight," The Chaos
","In my review of 'Batman Begins' I wrote that it is as realistic as a superhero movie gets to be. I guess I was wrong. 'The Dark Knight' takes everything up a notch. The stakes stay the same, the future of Gotham and the lives of its citizens, but the chaos and panic now spread beyond just the Narrows as the people all over Gotham become aware of the threat.The main outlines of the plot are simple, there's a new villain in town (The Joker) and his goal is to create chaos. At the same time newly appointed district attorney Harvey Dent tries to capture and convict mobsters who took on the business after the death of Carmine Falcone. The Joker offers his help to the mobsters and chaos ensues.The first movie had some sort of mythical note to it. It involved a secret organization and their eternal mission, and it also had to explain how Batman, itself a sort of mythical figure, came to be. The second one takes a different approach. The Joker doesn't have any grandiose plan or hidden agenda, he is an 'ordinary' person who just got to be smarter and crazier than most, and that's what makes the whole thing feel more realistic. He is brought to the screen in a brilliant fashion by the late Heath Ledger who won a posthumous Oscar for the role (a precedent for a comic book inspired movie) and easily made The Joker both his most prominent role and the most impressive character from a Batman movie. But it isn't just Ledger's fantastic acting which makes The Joker so memorable, it's also the way he's written (the interrogation scene with Batman and Joker is an unequaled gem of contemporary Hollywood cinema). Joker isn't there just to create chaos, he is there to show what people are capable of when they are pushed to the limits. He wants to expose people as savages with fake morals he believes them to be, and he wants to prove Batman his rules are breakable. He (partially) succeeds in both, along the way corrupting Gotham's 'White Knight', Harvey Dent.It's interesting how in the end two villains leave people's lives, one in the hands of chance and the other in the hands of other people. Neither of that being a usual villain's move. And the movie makes you wonder what's worse. It's shown that some people however bad they are can have some good in them, but it's also shown how good people can be driven over the edge, making dependence on other people not so inviting option. Chance on the other hand has a chaotic element to it, you never know what will happen, and people need some kind of rules and certainty in their lives, however illusionary they are. And there comes Batman. He's not a person as much as idea. A symbol of incorruptible force ready to do whatever is necessary to make things right, and the only possible salvation for the people of Gotham.Another question the movie raises is that of choice and the feeling of responsibility caused by it. Many times throughout the movie the characters must choose and in the end they are held accountable for their choices no matter who or what made them do it. For example, The Joker made Batman choose between Rachel Dawes and Dent but purposely mixed up their locations. In that way he didn't just make Dent blame Batman for the consequences, but made Batman blame himself too. But why should he blame himself? He made the choice he believed was right. It wasn't his fault. But it was his choice. And if you think about it, we always hold ourselves accountable for our choices and their consequences, regardless of other factors. It's also the reason why the guy on the boat didn't push the button, he couldn't live with the consequence.But enough about moral issues. As I said, everything is bigger in this movie, not just the amount of philosophical/moral questions. There is more action, and it takes place during the day as well as during the night making the movie somewhat brighter, if only visually. The sequences are thrilling and tense, and are made that way with the help of great cinematography and exhilarating music. The visual and sound effects are even better than in the first one, creating, with all of the above, a fantastic watching experience. The cast, many of which reprise their roles, does a superb job. I already mentioned Ledger's performance and should also point out Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent.There are yin-yang references in the movie, representing the Chinese philosophical tradition (Joker at one point says to Batman 'You complete me.', and Two-Face is a reference all by himself), but there are also some references to Christianity (Batman, Gordon and Harvey Dent form a trinity needed to save the lives and souls of Gotham and its people, in the end Batman sacrifices himself for the salvation of the people who despise him just like Jesus did), opening more questions and making the movie even more complex.So, the movie is bigger, louder and filled with more action than its predecessor, but it's also more complex in terms of plot and the questions it raises. 'Batman Begins' stretched the superhero movie genre to its limits but 'The Dark Knight' broke out of it. It's an exciting action movie, a philosophical treatise on human nature, and a wonderfully crafted piece of art. And if you still haven't watched it you should correct that mistake right away.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",10,0,4,10 August 2012
Les Mis√©rables," A little change is always welcome
","Often these days prominent filmmakers decide to tell a story already told. Sometimes even a story told multiple times. Whether it's for a lack of ideas or because of their love of the subject and confidence they can make something special out of it is debatable, but whatever the reason the expectations from such endeavour are always high. That was also the case with the latest of that kind, Tom Hooper's Oscar hopeful 'Les Mis√©rables'.Adapted from a famous musical play which was in turn based on the novel by Victor Hugo (both having the same name as the film), the film retains the musical form and does it in an unusual way, with actors singing and recorded live during the shooting. It makes for a somewhat uneven experience due to the difference in actors' vocal capabilities and dependance on the conditions at given time. While the acting is solid across the board, more famous names like Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Sacha Baron Cohen or Helena Bonham Carter do mostly mediocre work singing-wise. Fortunately the young ones: Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, Aaron Tveit and Daniel Huttlestone, save the day with some great singing. And then there's Anne Hathaway with the performance which there's no sense in writing about but really just has to be seen.Technically the film is very good but has some minuses. Production design, cinematography, and editing while generally good make some scenes, especially those with the barricade, feel staged. That's probably the legacy of the play, which doesn't work as well in the film. That applies to parts of the story and some of the songs too. I don't know to what extent Hooper and the screen writing team (in which there were the authors of the play among others) stuck to the play but the theatricality is sometimes too apparent. Costume design on the other hand, as well as makeup and hairstyling, is as great as you would expect from a high budget period piece like this.As far as the story is concerned, there's little done to escape from its predictability. I imagine the screenwriters didn't want to steer too much from the source material, but they even didn't have to. A lot would be accomplished with just a little different balance of the themes. The revolution part of the story is left underdeveloped in spite of some striking scenes while too much time is spent on Jean Valjean's lamentations and a sense of thematic connection between the two is, I feel, not properly addressed. Also the relationship between Javert and Valjean is shown mainly as one between the hunter and the hunted while there's much more to it. For example, Valjean as the symbol of change is locked in the seemingly endless battle against Javert as the man who can't break from his own constraints. However, the end comes and Valjean emerges victorious, showcasing that a change will come despite of presently suppressed revolution. All of that and probably more is present in the subtext but Hooper unfortunately failed to put any emphasis on it.While the singing presents the story without any difficulties and make for some truly rousing scenes, its occasional lengthiness slows the film down making it unbalanced and overlong. In addition to a couple of overly pompous scenes, that degrades 'Les Mis√©rables' turning it into a good movie instead of a great one it could have been. It's a shame, but it is what it is. At least we can hear the people sing.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",7,0,2,5 February 2013
In Time," Got a minute?
","A study on The World Distribution of Household Wealth by the Helsinki-based World Institute for Development Economics Research of the United Nations University from 2006 showed that 2% of world population hold more than 50% of global wealth. The inequality is staggering, but most of the people really don't think that much about it. But what if the wealth was measured by the years, months, days, hours, even minutes of our lives? It's an interesting idea examined by Andrew Niccol in his latest movie 'In Time'. In the movie, people are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25 and get one more year after that. But the time they get is also a currency. They have to work to get it more and pay bills with it. Of course, some things always remain the same, so there's small number of people who can practically live forever and a large number of those who don't know if they'll survive another day. It should be noted that the exchange of time between two people is fairly easy. They simply hold each other's forearms and the time flows from one to the other. The direction of the flow depends on whose forearm is up and whose down. It's obvious that it makes stealing a lot easier so the rich ones need even greater protection than they need in this world. So the world (we see only north America but it's safe to assume it applies to the whole world) is divided in time zones, from the ghettos to the zones where the 'immortals' live. Traveling between zones isn't illegal but is extremely rare. Every zone has its border and the price you have to pay to enter and there aren't many who can afford it, and the rich ones don't travel but live in the safety of their time zone. Different currency asks for different control system and so we're introduced to the Timekeepers, some sort of police whose job is to keep track of time and make sure each time zone has the assigned amount of time. (Now thinking about it, definitely not the job for the White Rabbit.) The movie follows Will Salas, a young man from the ghetto whose father was a sort of local Robin Hood, winning time in fights and distributing it to the poor. One evening Will has a chance encounter with Henry Hamilton, a man who came from New Greenwich, the city of rich people, with more than a hundred years on his clock. Henry thinks no one should live forever so he transfers his time to Will and goes on to time himself out, that is - kill himself. Will wakes up with more time that he could dream of and that's when things start to happen fast. After he fails to save his mother in a scene which is a pain to watch (seriously, it's the lowest point of the movie), he decides to take on the big guys and goes to New Greenwich. But the death of Henry Hamilton has been uncovered and Will is caught on security tape so the Timekeepers, led by enigmatic Raymond Leon, start sniffing on his trail. They find him in the house of Philippe Weis, one of the richest people in the world, but he manages to escape by holding hostage Philippe's spoiled daughter Sylvia. After that, not long is needed for Sylvia to realize who is the good guy and join Will in his quest to steal from rich and distribute to poor.The premise of the movie is very interesting. As I already pointed out, and as anyone who thinks a little about it can notice, it reflects the current situation in real world, but with a twist. The idea of paying bills and buying stuff with time makes you think about all sorts of things. Would people be more careful with their spending? Would they take more care of the quality of their time? Those kind of questions and all other thought directions that the premise opens are the best thing about this movie. The rest unfortunately isn't on par but it isn't that bad either. The greatest flaws are in the script. Some scenes are overly melodramatic, a lot of the dialogue is clich√©d and predictable and the characters are overly simplified (with the exception of timekeeper Leon). Fortunately, in most scenes the acting makes it bearable. The movie benefits from strong performances by Justin Timberlake as Will Salas and Cillian Murphy as Raymond Leon, but the rest of the cast isn't that far behind either. I must point out Amanda Seyfried as Sylvia Weis, who maybe had better performances ('Chloe'), but never looked as stunning as she does here. Credits for that must also be given to Colleen Atwood, a multiple Oscar winner costume designer, as well as to all the crew from makeup department who've done a great job.It's a good movie, but it could've been better. I'll never get over the fact Niccol left such an interesting character as Raymond Leon so underused and didn't let us in on his past. On the other hand, it has a thought provoking theme and it's fun to watch, which is a rare combination nowadays, so my recommendation would be to watch it. That is, if you have any spare time...http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",6,0,0,24 July 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," The price of success
","On May 2nd 2011, SEAL Team Six of U.S. Special Forces killed Osama bin Laden. That messed up plans of director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal who were working on a film about a years-long and unsuccessful hunt for the man. They of course changed the story and reportedly scrapped all of their previous work to start anew. The result is 'Zero Dark Thirty' (a term marking time between midnight and dawn), one of the most lauded films of the year with five Oscar nominations but also one of the most controversial with its depiction of torture at CIA black sites.The torture scenes caused a lot of fuss in USA with many taking them as a sign of approval of the methods and politicians from both sides of the spectrum condemning the movie, claiming that no piece of information which lead to the murder of Osama bin Laden came from torture. But are that scenes really that problematic? It is widely known that US military utilized torture in interrogation and it's fair to assume that was so in those first few years of the hunt for bin Laden when the emotions were running high. Not to mention that in the film the torturing really doesn't prove all that useful. It gives Maya, a CIA operative and main character, a name which she never heard of before yet she decides to pursue it relentlessly only to find out that everyone else know of that name, which makes us wonder how she never heard of it in the first place. What's more interesting is that, although both politicians and the authors of the film claim that the whole operation was a product of hard and dedicated work by a group of extraordinary individuals, the film shows it just as a combination of one person's hunch and persistence and pure luck. Now, an idea of US intelligence services functioning just on hunch and luck, that's something really controversial, but to my surprise no one seems to have noticed that.'Zero Dark Thirty' is in its essence a classic underdog story. A young, unexperienced, but talented operative has everything going against her but in the end prevails. Although the end is not a happy one for her as she realises that she has no life outside the just completed mission. The main problem with the story is a lack of emotions it provides. We never find out what is it that's driving Maya, making her disregard everything else in favor of her job. The only thing I can assume is that it's a desire to prove she is equally capable as the rest of her colleagues (if not more so) and to make a name for herself amongst them. That adds the subject of male-female (in)equality to the film, parallels with director Bigelow being more than obvious. However, the fact she succeeded more due to a coincidence than to hard work and especially the characterization of the other female operative don't do it justice.As with any other work based on a true event there is a conversation on how closely does it follow the truth, but, as always, it's completely misplaced. It's not a documentary and its goals should lie elsewhere, namely in making a compelling and tense middle part because we all know how it begins and how it ends. But it's right there where the film fails. After learning of Abu Ahmed's existence and of his connection to bin Laden as his personal courier the investigation reaches a dead end. It becomes more and more obvious that they really can't find the guy but then a file which no one knew existed miraculously appears and Abu Ahmed's true identity is revealed. It still doesn't help much though. Maya and her colleagues narrow the search to two cities in Pakistan from which he's calling home, but he always calls from a different public phone and they simply don't have enough men to cover all of them. Another situation with no way out requires another miracle. This time the courier buys a cell-phone and they get his number. Why would a man so careful to cover all of his tracks suddenly buy a cell-phone thus allowing the CIA operatives to track him down is beyond my comprehension. But even after that the film doesn't pick up pace. It took around half a year of surveillance to get permission to invade the residence of Abu Ahmed, and the film makes sure we get that. For most of the time the characters do nothing but show their powerlessness and all the scenes that could leave some impact on the viewer are brought down in advance by suggestive filmmaking which make us foresee the outcome. When in the final half an hour came the much anticipated raid scene, my attention was in spite my best efforts much lower than in the beginning and I found the way it is filmed pretty messy and unclear. While my low attention no doubt helped it feel that way, it's a fact that Bigelow didn't care much for the clarity on that one. I can imagine that lack of clarity would easily be the case if I were to look at a real operation, still I feel that in the film the viewer should know who's where doing what.Read the complete review at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",5,2,7,21 January 2013
Prometheus," Prometheus?
","After 33 years Ridley Scott decided to revisit the universe first created in ¬ÑAlien', but this time around he decided on a (almost) completely different approach. Unlike the ¬ÑAlien' which speaks of most primal human emotions, ¬ÑPrometheus' is more concerned with human thirst for knowledge and answers to eternal questions. What is our purpose? Is there God? Is there extraterrestrial life? As all of you who watched the movie could see, it answers only part of this questions.The rest of them are likely to be answered in the inevitable sequel, but that's not of concern here. It's important to note that in spite of philosophical questions, ¬ÑPrometheus' is mainly a science fiction movie, and like in most sci-fi movies, visuals and action play great part in it. So it's a movie that should work on many levels. Unfortunately it only works on some.The story is intriguing. Based on ancient drawings found all over the world the planet, where our creators supposedly wait for us, is located and spaceship Prometheus, along with its crew, is sent to investigate it. As you could imagine, when they land things go downhill. All this is preceded by a scene which is probably showing a creation of life on Earth (or some similar planet). We see a big white humanoid called ¬Ñengineer' drinking some strange black liquid, throwing himself in the water and dissolving in it. Later in the movie we find out the DNA of these humanoids has the same structure as ours, hence the previous interpretation. Here we can note main problem of this movie in example. Elizabeth Shaw, one of the main characters, finds out about the DNA match and tells no one about it!? She does later share it with her partner and colleague Charlie Holloway, but it's some time later and you would think this kind of discovery is something she would immediately announce to everyone on board. This is just an example of illogicalities in the script, of which there are more than few and there is no point in writing them all here. These plot holes are main flaw of the movie along with poorly written characters. For example: A man who financed whole expedition to the planet of our makers (which, by the way, it turns out not to be) is one Peter Weyland. A very wealthy businessman and visionary who believes humans are the new gods but apparently still seeks the old ones. For one of such intellect and skills it's rather odd how he conducts a meeting with engineer, despite of his old age. There's also an android in search of answers to the questions it shouldn't even ask. Or should it? Or should I say ¬Ñhe'? In addition to plot holes and poorly written characters there are few over-the-top moments which seem really unnecessary. Shaw giving birth is the first one that comes to mind.But, surprisingly enough, it isn't as bad as it seems. In terms of visual effects, art direction, costumes, cinematography, sound editing, and all other related areas, the movie is flawless. Even it's use of 3D is very good, which can't be said of nearly every movie since ¬ÑAvatar'. The soundtrack also holds ground. Combined with wide shots of Prometheus crew in big spacious caverns it creates the feeling of anxiety filmmakers probably hoped for. At least they got something right. It should also be noted that the acting is pretty good considering how the characters are written. Kudos to Michael Fassbender for he showed us how to be the perfect android, Peter O'Toole AND Lawrence of Arabia all at once! What to say in the end? As you could see, the movie leaves you with (too) many questions. Some it should, some it shouldn't leave you with. Scott said that the blu-ray/DVD version will be 20 to 30 minutes longer. We can only hope that the extended version will eliminate part of the questions. Maybe even part of the scenes, although that is hard to expect. There is also the case of the sequel but judging by this one, they shouldn't jump right on it. At least not till they have all the answers they should have.http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",6,1,7,25 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Hope
","And so it came to an end. Nolan began his Batman trilogy in 2005 and we've waited seven years for the conclusion. The main question is, of course, does it deliver? And the answer is yes...and no. So let's explain that.After all the fuss 'The Dark Knight' caused, Nolan knew he would have to come up with something even bigger for the third part, and that he did. As in the first two parts, in 'The Dark Knight Rises' the future of Gotham is at stake, but this time the threat is even bigger and there's not a soul unaware of it. Ra's Al Ghul was a threat to the Narrows, The Joker to all of Gotham, but a new villain named Bane is a threat to all of the world. He imprisons Gotham with his army and puts a nuclear bomb into play with the world watching. That kind of terrorist element wasn't present till now. Maybe Nolan thought enough time has passed since 9/11 or maybe he just needed a bigger issue for the third part. Whatever the reason, one of the biggest issues in modern America became one of the movie's main themes. And it's interesting to note how it's not the only present American issue tackled in the movie. Bane's attack on the Gotham stock exchange and one of the employee's worried explanation how if the criminals succeed all people's savings won't be worth anything, clearly make reference to the recent Wall Street problems and the impact they had on American (and world) economy.But of course, those are not the only issues present in the movie. Like its predecessor, it continues questioning human nature and decisions. It shows there can be good even in a bad person (Bane's capability of love), but it also shows how good people are capable of doing bad things (Gordon's lies, some of the Catwoman's actions) either for their own sake or for the greater good (which is another interesting theme in itself). It also tries to tackle the idea of a society without regulations, where people can do as they please and chaos rules.The problem is all of those themes can be recognized in the movie, but they're not given enough thought and attention. The movie functions primarily as an action movie, and with all that action and a lot of stuff going on there's not enough space left for a serious representation of any of the mentioned issues. One issue, however, makes an exception. The issue of hope. It's also something talked about in the previous movies but here it's approached in different ways. On the one hand there is hope for salvation and a better life (both in common people and in Bruce Wayne), but on the other there is an idea of hope as an integral and crucial part of suffering which only makes it worse. There's also the fact that this is the last part of a trilogy so it must tie all loose ends and give a satisfactory conclusion. And in that it succeeds.Bruce Wayne started as a broken down human being and found his way of moving on by giving himself a greater purpose and transforming into a symbol. But once his purpose was done and there was no need for that symbol no more, he lost himself again. Which shows that in fact nothing changed. So he had to go through transformation as Batman to complete his transformation as a man and go on with his life. That's why we see a 'dirtier' Batman, with less gadgets and tricks and more fist fighting. The transformation is also shown near the end of the movie, when Batman fights Bane in the middle of the massive fight between cops and mercenaries. It was said many times how anyone of the people could be Batman, but only now Batman became one of them. He's more human here than ever before, and he needed to be so he could kill Batman and carry on with his life as Bruce Wayne.But let's say a few words about the new characters as well. Bane, played very impressively by Tom Hardy, seems a little underdeveloped. As if his moves and decisions hadn't been given enough thought. And it all ends up being even more puzzling when we find out his true motivation. Miranda Tate, Bruce's new business partner, is potentially the most interesting character but unfortunately ends up being the most inconsistent and disappointing one. Blake, a young police officer, is another character going through important changes in the movie. Changes not so believably done, but nevertheless with a satisfying conclusion. That leaves us with Selina Kyle/Catwoman, another character in need of transformation (this time done well, if a little clich√©d). She's played with fantastic seductiveness by Anne Hathaway, and makes a great partner for Batman. There's a certain chemistry between Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway which makes every scene with the two of them in it stand out. Especially the Batman-Catwoman ones.As it can be expected, the movie excels in all technical categories. Combine that with very good acting and probably the best Batman soundtrack to date and all you need to add to have an all-time classic on your hands are a great script and direction. Unfortunately, those are lacking. They're not that bad, but the script tries to do too much with too little and lacks focus in some places, and the same can be said about direction, with Nolan bent on over-explaining that which is already clear and under-explaining that which is not.As we've said, the expectations for 'The Dark Knight Rises' were very high, and we should've known it probably wouldn't reach the heights of its predecessor. Nevertheless, it's a very good movie which is a joy to watch and makes up for not being great in itself by bringing a great conclusion to the trilogy.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",8,1,3,24 August 2012
Looper," To be, or not to be, that is the question
","'Looper' is a new action Sci-Fi getting overwhelmingly positive reviews and comments and even named movie of the year by some, which is pretty unusual for a movie of that genre. Written and directed by Rian Johnson, it tells of a world where time-travel was invented and immediately prohibited but is still used by criminal organisations. When they need to get rid of someone they send him 30 years in the past when an assassin kills him. Those assassins are called loopers and we follow the story of one of them, a guy called Joe. Joe is the youngest looper but he does his job without mistake. That is, until he has to kill his older self. You see, in the future they started hunting old loopers and sending them back to their younger selves with a big payment. That is called 'closing the loop' and essentially means early retirement. So Joe finds himself closing his loop but things go amiss and older Joe escapes. The criminal organization led by a man from the future named Abe immediately starts searching for Joe, Joe searches for his older self, and older Joe searches for the Rainmaker, a mysterious figure who rules by iron fist in the future and gave away an order to kill all loopers, but is just a little child in 2042.The movie is deemed as very original and is applauded for it, and while parts of the script have a refreshing originality, the concept of time-travel and the ideas of facing your older/younger self and changing the future by intervening in the past are nothing new. Some of them (and some other as well) are explored in last year's another critical favourite, 'Source Code' (be sure to see it if you haven't already) which came to my mind while watching 'Looper'. Both are uncommonly complex and smart Sci-Fi movies and they share some themes, but they have a crucial difference. While 'Source Code' is a Sci-Fi only because of its unusual idea of inserting thoughts and personality of one person into the body of another (who is by the way in past, so time-travel plays a role here too), 'Looper' is a true genre movie. Johnson creates a believable futuristic world enriched with small details like hovering bikes, telekinesis and (inevitably) a new drug consumed as eye-drops and makes us want to see more of it. It's really a shame we don't but the movie aims for much more and there has to be room for everything.The main concern of 'Looper' are moral and philosophical issues. It asks questions like: 'Can killing innocents be justified by what could happen in the future?', 'What are we willing/allowed to do to save ourselves?', 'Is our future predetermined?', 'Can we change it?', 'What is our life worth?', and many more. And it's a great achievement that it succeeds in making those questions relevant while simultaneously offering a great dose of action, somewhat clich√©d love story and a whole lot of time-travel issues. Those issues are being discussed in detail all over the Internet but, while entertaining and interesting as a conversation theme, shouldn't be put in the foreground because they easily let you forget about all aforementioned great things in this movie.The movie has a very well written screenplay and benefits from an inspired direction, which wouldn't be enough had it not a great cast too. Bruce Willis, and especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job portraying the same character. Gordon-Levitt wears prosthetics which help him look like young Willis (although he looks kind of awkward occasionally) but most of the job is done by him. The facial expressions, gestures and tone of voice are first-rate and young actor once again shows his huge range. There are some less captivating performances like those of Emily Blunt and Paul Dano, but there are also memorable, although short, appearances by, always great, Jeff Daniels and Garret Dillahunt, which give the movie even more appeal. Talking about appeal, Steve Yedlin's cinematography is fantastic. The movie is full of beautiful wide shots and striking close-ups and really demands seeing in a movie theater for full effect. An important contribution to the overall atmosphere is one of the best Sci-Fi soundtracks in years, done by Nathan Johnson, Rian's cousin and frequent collaborator (and partner in folk duo 'The Preserves', but that's some other story). It makes a great job emphasizing all the emotional moments and injects additional suspense in the action sequences.So I've written a lot and said only a small part of what's on my mind. That's the sign I should stop or else I'll never finish. 'Looper' is above all else food for thought, and as that it deserves all the attention it got. Add to that its genre basis and you'll realize what we have here is a very likely future cult movie to be talked about for the years to come. Don't know about you, but I will definitely loop back to the beginning of it the first chance I get.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",8,2,6,10 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," A multitude of drops
","Every once in a while there comes a movie which strives to break the boundaries of cinema and storytelling and go beyond the limits of our imagination. Those movies provide unique viewing experience and leave marks on your heart as well as your mind. Just from watching the extended trailer (probably the best I've ever seen) it was apparent that the latest work from directors Lana and Andy Wachowski and Tom Tykwer falls into that category. It is a movie called 'Cloud Atlas', just like the book written by David Mitchell which it's based upon.The movie contains six interwoven stories spanning from 19th century to distant post-apocalyptic future and converging into a timeless message about love, justice and the importance of human actions. It unravels thematically rather than chronologically, showing similar situations in different stories as though they all take place simultaneously. That resulted in a lot of short scenes and required extensive editing which, although it finely underlines common themes, will no doubt prove to be too demanding for part of the audience. Another thing which could be confusing for some but really works to the movie's advantage is the casting of the same actors in a multitude of different roles. Although the characters are different, there is a common denominator to the roles played by the same actor. Sometimes it's a stereotype like in the case of Hugo Weaving who plays a villain in every story, and sometimes it's a more nuanced trait like with Tom Hanks whose characters follow their own interests whether motivated by love, greed, or self-preservation, heroes and villains alike. The casting, consisting of the actors of both genders and all of the races where each of them plays characters of both genders and all of the races, has a special and unique role in this movie carrying in itself one of the messages the authors wish to share. The one of equality between all human beings. Considering all that is said about the casting it's obvious the actors had to be in their top form, and fortunately for most of the parts they've been. It's worth pointing out Hugh Grant and Tom Hanks doing great job in roles completely against the type. Hanks is a little less convincing in his standard good-guy roles, trying maybe too hard to make a difference between them, but that doesn't diminish the great work he's done here.As in acting, we can see oscillations in other areas such as make-up and prosthetics. While some of it looks great (Hugh Grant as a Kona Chief, Hugo Weaving as Old Georgie), some is disappointingly poor (Caucasian actors as Koreans). The same disbalance is found in the music, with great main theme and not so interesting rest of the soundtrack. Trying to cover as many genres as they could (thriller, romance, history, comedy, sci-fi, drama, adventure), the directors made a commendable effort, and even the single comedic story, which feels a little disconnected because of its tone at first, greatly fits in the overall movie. There are many other things making more sense after watching the movie for the second time, and some completely new revelations too. At first I thought some stories were weaker than the others, but now I manage to see them as one, just as the directing trio, and the author of the book of course, imagined it.The main message of the movie is that of the importance of battle against oppression which, at least that's what the authors believe, is never in vain, for our every action leaves consequences we're not even aware of. The oppression is always that of people in power over those they consider less worthy, whether because of their skin colour, age, sexual orientation, social status or just because they are weaker. It's a story well known in today's world. We see the same thing happening all over it. Thus the message is as important as it can be.'Cloud Atlas' is probably one of the most ambitious movies, if not ever, then certainly of this century. It connects what seems unconnectable in terms of genres, stories, characters and messages. It brings together art and entertainment in a glorious fashion, engaging all of our senses and making us think and feel at the same time. It acknowledges the obvious but still gives hope. It tells us it's worth being ourselves. And I can't think of a greater thing a movie can do.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",9,8,13,12 December 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," The appeal of horror
","The horror genre lost its originality years ago. With the exception of few refreshing movies ('The Descent', 'Rec', 'Amer', original 'Saw'), it's comprised of remakes, sequels, and multiple reiterations of the same themes done in the same way. Yet people still watch horrors. It's like there's some kind of need for brutality and gruesomeness. Can it be that getting scared and seeing other people die makes us feel more alive? 'The Cabin in the Woods', a new horror directed by Drew Goddard from a script by himself and Joss Whedon, seems to think so and takes that premise to the extreme.Five friends are going on a trip to some cabin deep in the woods to spend a fun weekend far from all kinds of commitment, people, and civilization in general. That sounds like a standard horror plot, but what neither they nor we know is that it's also as far from truth as it can be. The movie opens with two guys in some kind of office building going about their daily routine and seeming pretty indifferent about their jobs. It will turn out their job is much more serious than it looks in the beginning. From there we go to the friends packing for the trip and as we're watching them connections between the two are gradually revealed. Since the movie can't be properly discussed without an abundance of spoilers anyway, I'll just briefly explain the plot. In the earth beneath us live ancient gods who demand sacrifice or they'll destroy us all. So the rituals are created all over the world to appease the gods. What we see in the movie is basically one such ritual, with five people being killed to save us all. But as in any ritual there's a procedure that must be followed, and here comes the fantastic homage to horror genre. The characters are given a chance of survival, but that chance is only illusory as there is a whole crew modifying their surroundings, just like in a horror movie. So it's like watching a movie and behind-the-scenes simultaneously. There are also specific roles for each character: the whore, the athlete, the scholar, the fool, and the virgin. And, of course, they must all be young. They also must choose the weapon of their destruction by themselves, so in the cellar of the cabin they are introduced to a whole bunch of creepy and mysterious objects each representing one kind of monster the crew from the 'office building' has at their disposal. Another parallel with the movie-making business.But the movie goes far beyond the homage to horror genre. It actually speaks about the end of humanity and what would we do to stop it. One of the most horrifying things is the easiness with which the crew responsible for the ritual does their job. And yet it is one that is so human. We as a species survive by adapting to circumstances (if we can't change them) and excluding emotions. At the same time we want to differentiate ourselves from other animals and have notions like fairness, nobility or friendship. All of those instincts and notions come together in this bizarre fight between the two groups of people. One being immoral and cruel for sacrificing people and the other being selfish for putting themselves before the whole world. Sort of collectivism vs. individualism battle with no definite answer.On top of all that layers 'The Cabin in the Woods' functions as a great horror, creating suspense and scaring us with more than just cheap tricks, and also as a great comedy in its behind-the-scenes segment. The credit for that goes to all the cast and crew. The acting is simply fantastic. From Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth and Fran Kranz as part of the five friends to brilliant performances by Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins as those pulling the strings. All the other elements like cinematography, editing, music and production design are flawless and brought together by Goddard's assured debut direction. But the thing that rises above all else is the screenplay. What Goddard and Whedon have written is simply amazing. The originality of the idea, the beauty of the dialogue, the perfect balance between the two sides of the story, it just makes you want to watch it again and again. At least it did that for me.'The Cabin in the Woods' is a movie about horrors, a horror about movies, a comedy about human sacrifice, a thriller about five people in the woods, a story about the end of the world, and above all an excellent piece of work that gets even better with each subsequent viewing. So be sure to watch it more than once. Who knows, maybe next time they will finally choose the merman.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",9,3,6,30 October 2012
