The Blair Witch Project," This Movie is so bad i gotta write a review about it
","The only Reason this 'Movie' got all the attention and the Hype is not because of The Movie itself its because of the story and hype that was build around it, they used it just for the PR (which i admit was a pretty good idea) so they could make tons of money for a shitty Flick with no effort. This 'Movie' gives u the biggest Middlefinger u can ever get, imagine it itself without the Hype and all u get is a Lazy and Insulting 'Movie'.(in my eyes it's not a real movie cuz Movies need a certain Standard of quality to be called Movie, which this Movie does not have. Just cuz u do a few videos on your trashy camera doesn't make it a Movie).I can't say Much about The Product itself it's Not Interisting, Frightening, The Actors are Bad, Lame Story, Horrible Effects and Audio. Overall Just a really really Bad Movie, To bad u can't give a Movie Zero Points",1,2,7,28 October 2016
