Angels & Demons," awful casting
","not only is the story absurd the performances matched it in every way. tom hanks looks nothing like professor the wussy voice the blank expression, the nonsense where the clues are left until the final denouement is a test of tolerance if not intelligence .like the DA vinci code the plot is ridiculous full of holes Agatha Christie managed it better. then we come to Ewan MacGregor. why does this one note actor get so many movies ,increasigly un-photogenic, stuck with a toneless voice he was totally useless as the priest. if the film stood any chance at all it vanished once MacGregor was cast. hes now brought his baleful presence to the ghost writer. i just don't get why directors want to use him for if he was pretty boy there'd be an excuse. the best part of the film was the tour of rome and the reconstruction of the Vatican interiors rightly the church authorities refused to co -operate. badly acted an insult to crediblity i wish i'd saved my cash.",1,4,6,16 May 2010

Singin' in the Rain," dancing is great
","Firstly the dancing is terrific Kelly's show stopper singing the rain but cyd charisse does it for most of men in e audience ,it catapulted her into top stardom-Donald o Connor is great too -Debbie is Debbie that being said the plot is very uncomfortable-40 year old man chasing a teenager while dumping his co-star is Kelly at his misogynistic worst. hes played this i 'm so irresistible guy in most of his movies stealing his best friends girls etc- women as chattels- the victim this time is Jean Hagen -Lina Lamont dim and exploited ,then humiliated well great- when i was kid i felt sorry for lina-I still do- the final calumny the beautiful girls number- jimmy Thompson not being given a credit -asked many years later why not Thompson said that is Gene for you and shrugged",5,0,5,18 March 2018
