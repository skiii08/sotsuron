Hereditary," One of the best horror movies out there!
","The acting is fantastic. Alex Wolff's scene in the car on the way back from the party is just acting brilliance, just his facial expressions in that scene are enough to scare anyone. The whole cast was great and the directing was well done as well.",10,2,4,29 August 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," brilliant, funny and entertaining. A must see
","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Its not a long film at only 95 minutes but it features so much entertainment, nothing feels rushed or forced.Stanley Kubrick did an excellent job of fitting all this action into this small running time. It's well written and the acting in this film is outstanding. Peter Sellers delivers great performances on each of his 3 characters Group Captain Lionel Mandrake,U.S President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove. George C. Scott is brilliant and hilarious as General Buck Turgidson. Overall an absolutely timeless classic and a definite must see for everyone.",10,2,3,2 November 2016
Get Out," Great movie
","Woah! I usually find horror movies boring and predictable but this one really scared me. The pacing is just perfect, the writing is amazing, the direction is solid too.",10,0,2,4 July 2018
La La Land," Timeless Classic, elegant, seemingly effortless and just plain beautiful.
","La la land is already a Classic, it's the kind of movie our grand kids will still be amazed by 50 years from now.I love everything about this movie from the start to finish. The ending is heart breaking but I love it none the less. The plot, the cinematography, the music, the dancing, all the jazz, the chemistry between our two leads make this movie special.I have never been a fan of musicals, in fact this is the only musical I like because it doesn't try very hard, all of the music and dancing comes off very naturally and unforced.This movie deserves the Oscar for best picture but it was just unlucky.",10,2,2,5 November 2019
Some Like It Hot," I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder but I hate this movie
","Double indemnity, sunset boulevard, the apartment and Witness for the prosecution are all in my top 50 favorite movies of all time. So I went into this film with great expectations but I was very much disappointed. The plot sounds very exciting but something went wrong somewhere. Instead of laughing, I was bored out of my mind and at the end of the day the jokes and humor of the movie felt forced and unfunny. The acting was mer and I don't find Marilyn Monroe attractive.",3,2,4,1 July 2019
It's a Wonderful Life," Masterful and brilliantly re-energizing film
","An almost perfect film, that really delivers in its aim to get you thinking in the end about your life and the lives you've affected.The only small issue I have is in the bridge scene when Mr. George Bailey contemplates suicide by jumping off a bridge into the ice cold water, he actually does jump but to rescue an Angel, proving that the bridge fall was just too low for a suicide.",10,1,3,28 December 2018
Enemy at the Gates," I have a slight problem with a French capitalist directing a movie from the Communist Soviet union perspective.
","I wish russians had made this movie themselves, I like people telling their own stories and I'm dying to see ww2 movies from the Soviet perspective told by the Russians themselves. I mean we've all seen movies from the allies (mostly american perspective) and the axis (mostly German perspective) but I want to see more Russian ww2 movies like 'come and see' the world needs to see these movies.",7,0,1,1 July 2019
Parasite," Amazing absolutely loved it.
","Great movie, great writing, greating acting and great cinamotography. The only reason I am giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the ending.I feel like filmmakers should have had the guts to leave the ending messy with a bit of mystery. After Mr Park gets stabbed they should have just ended it there, that would have had much more of an emotional effect on moviegoers.",9,35,59,11 January 2020
Halloween," How could this have been scary in 1978?
","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, its hard for me to imagine someone in 1978 thinking this was a good movie because I mean they already made some masterpieces back then but this certainly isn't one. Boring plot, boring music, boring direction and boring performances from all the actors in it.",1,4,20,19 September 2018
Marriage Story," Amazing acting and a compelling story.
","Great performances from both leads. Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are a couple going through a divorce, this movie takes us through that painful process.The movie starts off light and beautiful but gets sadder and sadder as it goes on. We get the couple expressing their feelings about why they love each other. The film does an excellent job at portraying the perspective of both characters and pulling us into caring about both of them.Although this movie is mostly sad and is about a sad subject you will find yourself laughing out loud a few times. Two particularly funny scenes come to mind, one is were Nicole, her mother and her sister are talking about serving Charlie the divorce papers. The other funny scene is when Charlie accidentally cuts himself.I didn't enjoy the singing at the end but other than that I enjoyed everything else.",9,8,11,20 January 2020
Black Panther," Fantastic best movie of 2018 so far by a mile
","The fictional country of Wakanda is beautiful, the sunsets, landscapes and waterfalls are breathtaking. One of the scenes that stuck with me is the sunset scene with T'Challa and N'Jadaka near the end its so beautiful and powerful. Unlike all the other MCU movies this one feels more like an adventure movie than just a plain old superhero film like I said the lighting, colour, score and costumes are just amazing. The usual thing to do in comic book movies is to just totally ignore the character development of the villain and just concentrate on the hero, well Black Panther doesn't go that route, opting to concentrate on the hero and the villain equally. Achieving something truly rare in Hollywood movies a perfectly complete character arc for a villain. I saw this movie 3 times at the theater and about 20 times now on BluRay. I get why some MCU fans wouldn't like it because it needs a little bit of investing but for me as a big fan of movies in general, this is a masterpiece.",10,1,2,4 July 2018
Creed II," Pretty Good but predictable
",Creed 2 does justice to its predecessor in raising the stakes and character development. Adonis still treats Rocky like trash though.,8,2,2,8 March 2019
