Catch Me If You Can," A Con Story in More Ways Than One (Spoilers)
","To judge from the comments posted so far, few if any viewers have actually read the book on which this movie is based, which may explain the generally good reception. However, if you have read the book, as I have, you are in for a disconcerting experience, because roughly 75% of it has been altered, invented, and/or omitted in the transition to screenplay.Yes, the movie merely says it's 'inspired' by Abagnale's book, and we all know that movies have to punch up autobiograpical material in places to appeal to movie audiences. And 2 hours inevitably requires compressing (and discarding) a lot of material.But the problem with 'Catch Me' is that the alterations often don't make sense even from a movie point of view. For instance, early in the movie Abagnale uses a bogus check to 'pay' a hooker. This scene comes out of nowhere, is played entirely for (minor) laughs, and is promptly forgotten. In the book, the event appears much later, and Abagnale makes clear that this broke his own personal code of only ripping off banks and similar institutions, not people, and was justified only because she came on to him under false pretenses. This interesting moral nuance is thus completely lost in the movie, rendering the scene pointless.Also, incomprehensibly, the movie fails to follow Abagnale on his European adventures, including his amazing 'marketing' scam involving unsuspecting would-be 'stews' (which is instead implausibly turned into a ruse to get past Hanratty at Miami Intl Airport). This story, which ends with his getting ratted out by a French former girlfriend and thrown in an appalling French prison, is far more dramatic, and cinematic, than the heavily abbreviated rendition of it in the movie.Even more unsatisfiying is the omission of Abagnale's hilariously brazen escape from the Atlanta prison where he is initially transferred after being returns to the States, not to mention his first close brush with Hanratty, or his near-fatal slip-up involving a forged check with his real name on it. Why call a movie 'Catch Me If You Can' if you are going to leave the book's most memorable escapes on the cutting room floor?Spielberg's apparent decision to cut the book's heady mix of sex, cons and exotic locations in favor of a trite (and contrived) psychological subplot about Frank Jr.'s Oedipal problems, only succeeds in robbing the story of the precise reasons we go to see films about such a James Bond-like figure in the first place (the film's dashing title sequence hints at the movie that could have been). 'Catch Me If You Can' was moreover an autobiography, not a work of fiction. What Spielberg gives us is an imitation of that autobiography. In short, the film is itself a con, and only a mildly good one at that. Looks like audiences are too fixated on the pin stripes (see the movie to get the reference) to care.",Null,0,0,30 December 2002
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A truly subversive movie
","I was not a fan of South Park before I saw BL&U, nor was I a fan of movie musicals. Well, I'm still not a fan of musicals, but I'm a fan of *this* musical, and am grateful to Parker and Stone for demonstrating that it's still possible to make a great movie on one's own terms.For this movie, unlike the usual feature-length adaptation of a pop culture phenomenon, not only lives up to its pedigree, it wildly exceeds it. Yes, the movie does recycle many of the show's jokes, but it does so in new yet relevant contexts that keep the material funny if you are familiar with the South Park world. If you aren't familiar with that world (as I wasn't before seeing the movie), the gags are simultaneously accessible yet often subtle.Subtle? Yes, many of the gags are. Indeed, one of the pleasures of owning a copy of the movie is having the ability to review the movie, in slo-mo if necessary, and discover throwaway sight gags that one has missed in the delirium of watching this anarchic satire the first time through.  (And if you have the DVD, you can add subtitles to catch many of the songs' often elusive lyrics.)Then there's the music. What is it about movie musicals that attracts great satiric minds? Not since Pynchon's 'Gravity's Rainbow' has a work of art so subversively exploited the conventions of the movie musical as South Park. From the droll opening strains of Mountain Town, to the Disneyesque 'Up There,' to the Les Miserables spoof, 'La Resistance,' South Park simultaneously sends up the genre while paying homage to it, and still finds room to use the songs to score delicious points against its myriad targets.One last thing: this movie is not cynical. Beneath the scatological humor, the cartoon violence, the scathing portrayals of Wynona Ryder et al, and the backdrop of adult xenophobia, sexual repression and political opportunism, is a sensibility that exalts childhood as an island of honesty and idealism, if also of id-like impulse and frequent selfishness. In this they share space on the shelf of great satires with 'Candide,' 'Gulliver's Travels,' 'Tom Sawyer' and especially 'Huckleberry Finn'--classics that, like BL&U, also exposed the hypocrisies of the adult world 'through the eyes of a child.'Elvis Costello once sang, 'I want to bite the hand that feeds me/I want to bite that hand so badly/I want to make them wish they'd never met me.' That BLU was shut out at the Academy Awards (having only garnered a nomination for the relatively tame 'Blame Canada', which lost, appropriately enough, to the execrable Phil Collins) only vindicates the film's take-no-prisoners send-up of nearly everything that annoys in this suffociatingly focus-group-tested, PC-policed, cynically sentimental, violence-ridden, love-starved modern world. See this movie, and see the persistence of hope and possibility sparkling like a diamond amid the pop culture detritus of a quiet little red-necked, white-trash, strait-laced, mesuggeneh, US mountain town.",10,182,207,28 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Easily One of the Worst Movies I Have Seen
","'Attack of the Clones' is just dreadful on almost every level: plodding plot, leaden acting, cardboard dialog, clumsy editing, painfully trite themes, unfunny stabs at humor--even the vaunted action sequences, hyperkinetic though they are, have zero emotional involvement.And why should they? As Frank de Caro put it on The Daily Show last night, Yoda has more personality than any of the living breathing characters on the screen. Hell, the clones themselves are more interesting.The advance screening I saw yesterday had the audience howling in derision at the serious parts and groaning at the funny bits. I actually had to avert my eyes, such was embarrassment at the thought of having to sit through this.With the one-two punch of The Phantom Menace and, now Attack of the Clones, George Lucas stands revealed as the P.T Barnum of cinema, turning out cynical, overhyped dreck for uncritical consumption by the brainwashed booboisie. If this movie makes big money, Lucas should title his next installment, 'Return to the Egress.' Barnum would have enjoyed the in-joke.",1,0,1,17 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An epic worthy of the label
","A magnificent piece of film that works on all levels: dramatically, thematically, visually, musically, the works. It blows Harry Potter into the middle of next week.Even if only one a visual level, LOTR works because of the utter verisimilitude that its New Zealand locations and scrupulous attention to detail help sustain. Unlike Harry Potter, there is hardly a whiff of the studio set in the entire film, and the special effects, though indispensible to the film, are carried off by and large understatedly. Yes, Virginia, it is possible for special effects to be a means, not an end in itself.But what really makes the movie succeed is the complete immersion of the actors in their roles. There is none of the smirking, postmodern irony that afflicts actors in the typical post-Star Wars clones, the suggestion to the audience that we all know that this is just a special-effects-driven, rollicking good time, not meant to be taken seriously. These actors clearly believe in their roles, in the values of the book, and in each other, and the payoff for the audience is complete emotional absorption into the drama of their adventure.The audience anticipation for the next two installments--which are already in the can--is going to be excruciating. I wouldn't be surprised if a mob stormed the vaults to get them released early.This is one movie that can't be overhyped--though, as you can see, I'm trying.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
American Beauty," True and Original
","...Unfortunately, as a critic once noted about the book under his review, the true parts aren't original, and the original parts aren't true.Let's start with the true parts. As most know by now, American Beauty follows the tragicomic trajectory of an unhappily married middle-aged bourgeois, whose attempt to escape the drabness of middle-class life through a passionate infatuation with another only succeeds in destroying the lives of all involved. Sound familiar? It should: Flaubert dealt with it 150 years ago, in 'Madame Bovary.'But it's not necessary to go back that far. Critiques of American middle-class culture are about as plentiful as McDonald's in Riverside: take Ginsberg's 'Howl,' Heller's underappreciated 'Something Happened,' and almost anything by Updike, Roth, or Cheever, for starters. In film, one doesn't have to look farther than Billy Wilder's 'The Apartment' (literally, in my case: it's on TV as I type this). Anyone recall 'The Graduate'? ''I have one word for you: plastics' was pithier and more penetrating about American mass culture than anything in this movie.  'I've Heard the Mermaids Singing' mined the theme of the misfit artist well before this, and much more affectingly. The related theme of 'sane' American society as a lunatic asylum, and the 'lunatics' as rebellious artists, goes directly back to R. D. Lang, and finds much better realization in that counterculture staple, 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' than it does here. ('Beauty''s subplot deals with the relationship between a next-door neighbor boy, who, we learn, has recently been released from a mental ward.) And let's not even talk about the Freudian cliche of the homophobic military mentality, and its inexorable, violent desublimation.Even on smaller levels of detail, 'American Beauty' says very little that hasn't been said before. The dead narrator device was done first, again, by Billy Wilder, this time in 'Sunset Boulevard.' Visually, director Sam Mendes likes to film the family scenes as statically as possible, typically relying on symmetrical compositions and austere interior shots to get across the sterility of Lester Burnham's existence. We've been here before. too--in 'Ordinary People.' (Mary Tyler Moore did Carolyn Burnham better in that film, incidentally, than the competently done, but two-dimensional portrayal given her by Annette Benning in this one.) The level of plagiarism is so thoroughgoing in fact that when the sensitive artist character is shown videotaping a dead bird (because, he explains, it radiates divinity), those who know the history of photography will recognize it as an Edward Weston subject, circa 1954.In other contexts these kinds of second-hand themes and imagery might be inoffensive, even hip in an allusive, post-modern way. But the one thing that 'American Beauty' insists upon is the importance of purity of individual artistic vision, as exemplified in the person of Ricky Fitts, the sensitive boy-next-door artist figure, who obsessively videotapes the things that appeal to him. Why, then, does the film rely so shamelessly on the ideas and images of others?Perhaps the answer is that, when the film does reach for originality, it utterly fails to convince. Partly this is due to a failure of nerve. Unlike the anti-bourgeois, bohemian critiques of the 50s and 60s, whose contempt for middle-class values was unsullied by self-interest, 'American Beauty' needs those very middle-class filmgoers, desperately. Otherwise, how is the studio going to make back the production costs? Thus, the film shifts the locus of the cultural rot from the ticket-buying, middle-class many, to the well-hated few: the SUV-driving yuppie. Everyone hates yuppies--especially the securely rich, such as Hollywood filmmakers. That's because no one really IS a yuppie--at least, in their own minds. So the film safely critiques a world that no one is likely to recognize that they belong to.Yet, strangely, the yuppie class signals are still all wrong. We learn in passing that Lester Burnham makes a very unyuppie salary of $60K a year, at virtually the same desk job that Jack Lemmon had in 'The Apartment'; and his wife is an unsuccessful real estate agent. How they support the trappings of an upper-middle class lifestyle is never explained.The critique of yuppie materialism is also meretricious. When Lester rails at his wife for fetishizing their Italian sofa--screaming, 'It's just a thing, Carolyn! It's...just...a...thing'--one wishes that Carolyn had gone outside to Lester's freshly purchased vintage convertible and keyed the finish, just to put his newfound 'antimaterial values' to the test. But that would complicate things unduly.That the film's anti-yuppie pose is just that, is belied by its passing depiction of the neighborhood's openly gay couple. Alone among the film's characters they are depicted unironically as well-adjusted and outgoing--yet they inhabit the same sterile yuppie world as the Burnhams and the Fitts. How is that? One of two conclusions presents itself: either the film is equating the sterility of yuppie life with the sexual sterility of homosexuality (hardly likely, given the film's heavyhanded critique of homophobia), or the film is pulling its punches when it comes to the film's one PC minority. Neither reflects very flatteringly on the film.The film also tries to extend the metaphor of artist as rebel individualist by making Ricky Fitts not just a dope smoker (a standard trope of any Tom Robbins novel), but a dope dealer, and a highly successful one at that. Show of hands: how many of us pro-inhaling Clinton voters have ever known a virtuous, artistic dope dealer? I didn't think so. Yet Ricky isn't the only one who's virtuous--he seems to have only stolid, trustworthy clients and suppliers as well. Maybe this neighborhood isn't so bad--or so typical--after all?'American Beauty' is expertly acted, beautifully filmed, and tightly plotted, with little surprises in all the right places and expensive production values wall to wall. In other words, it's much like the empty yuppie landscape it critiques. And it made scads of money at the box office. That perhaps, is the most telling critique of all.",6,0,0,25 May 2000
The Exorcist," A Pretentious Mess
","When I first saw this movie in 1973, I was scared and confused by it. Iwas also 15. Seeing it again for the first time since then, I can say itheld up well in one respect: it's still confusing as hell.The movie suggests at the outset that Evil is Afoot with a prolongedsojourn to Iraq, where Max von Sydow's archeological crew has comeacross some biblical knickknacks and ugly statues. One of theseknickknacks apparently has Great Significance, because von Sydowspends a long time looking at it. Later on this tchotchke will inexplicablyturn up at the scene of a suspicious death. How did it get there? That'sthe least of the unanswered questions that this movie leaves strewn allover the screen like so much projectile vomit.Meanwhile over in the good old USA, the daughter of Chris McNeil(Ellen Burstyn), Regan, is acting strangely, and not just because LindaBlair can't act. She has gone from the sweet, sensitive pubescent girlwith the drawing talent of a precocious 6 year old, to a foul-mouthedmasturbating demon. Sounds like puberty to me. But in this film,nothing is as simple as it seems. Cue 'Tubular Bells.'Along the way William Friedkin sets the tone of omnipresent menace bysuggesting that Reagan's possession is part of a Larger Pattern ofThings Falling Apart, pieces of which include antiwar protests, a risingdivorce rate, and gay film directors. William Friedkin, meet Bill Bennettand Lynne Cheney; Bill, Lynne, William Friedkin.The film strives for big statements about Evil and Faith, but doesn'tseem to have a clue what it's talking about. Why does the Devil pickthis nondescript preteen to toss around like a Cabbage Patch Doll?Father Merrin tells the guilt-ridden Father Damien it's so that he canconvince us humans that we are nothing more than rutting animals. Oh,I see. And all this time I thought it was Linda Blair's subsequent filmcareer that did that.The film is not without its shocking moments (the most grisly, perhapsironically, being an excruciating spinal tap scene), but the payoff is sobrief, the buildup so tediously portentous, and the happy denouementso absurdly improbable (why doesn't the Devil just hop back intoRegan?) that all we're left with are those nagging unansweredquestions, the biggest being, WHAT THE HELL IS LEE J. COBBDOING IN THIS FILM?",5,1,7,8 October 2000
American History X," Powerful, but flinching
","Well before 'American History X,' back around 1990, I heard a real-life Derek Vinyard interviewed on radio. This articulate, former white supremacist had, like Derek, come to reject his racist  beliefs, and like Derek he had devoted his life to trying to make amends for his past by addressing youth and other at-risk groups. Unlike Derek, however, his analysis did not stop with platitudes about hate being bad, or even denunciations of white supremacist corruption and hypocrisy, as Derek comes to espouse. He contextualized his former life.When his fellow supremacists went out recruiting, he said, they did not go straight to overt racialist appeals. Instead they took advantage of the demagogic spadework begun by Pat Buchanan, Newt Gingrich and their ilk, and played the coded race cards of 'affirmative action', 'quotas,' 'busing' and 'urban crime.' He and his fellow supremacists knew exactly what the subtext of this rhetoric was, and they frankly appreciated the help given them by their 'respectable' allies in Washington and the media.It's too bad that this movie did not have the guts to make a similar connection with the larger political framework that Derek's prototype saw so readily. True, we do get a scene in which Derek's father fulminates in barely coded terms about affirmative action, and the anti-hate pseudo-strategy of film's token hapless liberal (well played by Elliott Gould) consists solely of a knee-jerk PC censorship reflex (ignoring the famous dictum about sunlight being the best disinfectant).But these glimpses into the larger sustaining milieu of white racism fall well short of helping audiences confront the continuum between overt racism and the 'respectable' politicial rheteoric that  feeds it. Instead, it is suggested through Derek's brother Danny that nice communities like Venice Beach just decayed passively as gangs moved in. Is it too much to expect some passing mention of decades of malign political neglect of our urban centers? Of a deliberate, decades-long widening of the gap between rich and poor, with the predictable (and frankly, intended) effect of pitting economically insecure lower-class whites and blacks against one another in a struggle for shrinking slices of the economic pie? Of the concomitant shredding of the social safety net?I don't think so. Other movies have explored the class-based terrain of race hate in a gripping fashion; 'Blood in the Face' comes to mind. It's necessary, but not enough, to show us the redemptive power of forgiveness, as 'American History X' does. (In an inspired symbolic moment of levity, Derek first breaks through his prejudices as his black prison co-worker, mimicking sex between two lovers who have just had a spat, pants orgiastically, 'I forgive you, baby! I forgive you!!!') If change is going to come about, it must begin with making audiences feel uncomfortable with their own unexamined assumptions and prejudices. And that, by and large, this movie fails to do.Nonetheless I share the general critical consensus that the performances in the film are first-rate, and the story expertly told. The elegiac score adds an affecting emotional dimension to the movie as well, perhaps suggesting, where the movie otherwise cops out, the sense of America's promise lost. And the film's tragic ending, while unconvincing to some, demonstrates the realization that our actions can have far-reaching repercussions beyond our control. On a purely dramatic level, the movie succeeds.However, AHX failure of nerve only helps guarantee that we have not seen the end of any further need for films like it in the future. And that's the real tragedy.",Null,0,0,11 June 2000

The Sixth Sense," Well-made, crowd-pleasing Hollywood product
","Look I enjoyed the movie, and the performances are extremely good (I understood in retrospect why the casting director got equal billing with the cast). But the movie is 'Ghost' plus 'Jacob's Ladder', minus the latter's paranoia. I would even bet that was how it was pitched to the producers. Good chick flick, with an Oscar-caliber performance from Haley Joel Osment, but let's not get carried away. This is Hollywood product",Null,0,0,8 January 2000
