The Monuments Men," Interesting story, disappointing execution
","This film had a great cast, the script was fairly good, but the execution was lousy. There were lots of funny moments that just weren't pulled off in a way that made them memorable. Perhaps the problem was that the film tried to take on too many different genres. It seemed to be stuck between a historical war movie, a silly comedy and a feel good hero movie.Even though there were a lot of great actors in the movie, there was too much jumping around to let the actual characters come through. Also the story seemed a bit disjointed, even if it was being accurately told, it didn't build suspense or flow in a way that kept you interested.",4,2,3,25 July 2015
