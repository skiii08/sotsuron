The Lobster," The right to choose not to choose
","Yorgos Lanthimos delves deeper into his realm of weirdness to portrait in 'The lobster' one of the most shocking, distressing and yet meaningful dystopian future the industry of cinema has thrown at us in decades. Does one really have the right to choose when he is denied the right to choose not to choose?No room for singles in this dystopian city out of Lanthimos' mind. No rights for them but a last chance to fix their malfunction, to set themselves right and find a partner. After all, there's no safe stroll without a partner, no dinner without risks without a partner, no being human without a partner. Its either marriage or a trip back to being an animal.But it is not just the oppressive atmosphere of the re-educating hotel Lanthimos crafts the best. It is the demonizing of both sides he delivers with utmost skill, showing no right choice but two opposite views stubbornly and cruelly carried through no matter the consequences. David must pick a side knowing both are wicked and wrong, and with all certainty that none will end well for him.Farrel delivers a great performance, topping an all around good performance from the whole cast.It is perhaps the subtle cruelty beneath all the glamour and glitter, the non-graphic violence delivered through oppressive peer pressure and witty dialogue that surprises the most and makes 'The lobster' so enjoyable. Yorgos excels once again at his social criticism, but manages to wrap it in a well packed film that will unsettle most but disturb none.",7,1,2,21 March 2017
Us," A change for the worse
","Peele's directorial debut 'Get out' was far from perfect. But that was simply because it didn't deliver on the big picture. Then again, there was a lot of good things that showed how good Peele's work could get by just adjusting a few details. So, with a bit more experience on his back and a very promising trailer, 'Us' was expected to be most likely his first masterpiece and a well awaited return to the good atmospheric horror in an era plagued by supernatural or posession movies driven by jumpscares, completely dark scenes and overly strident music scores.And for a short time he delivers. Not kicking out some of his old habits, Jordan Pelee still creates a great opening that -although too reminiscent of 'The strangers'- sets an incredibly eerie ambience and introduces some of the creepiest antagonists/killers the horror cinema has ever seen -thanks mainly to some awesome acting from the cast, specially the younger ones-. Then the film suddenly takes a turn. For the worse. For the very worst. After building this tense and serious atmosphere the story simply derives in some strangely clumsy comedy, with cringy catchphrases, clichee situations and a vibe more reminiscent of 'Zombieland' or 'Shawn of the dead' than a proper horror movie. And just so, the dread feeling and the sensation of danger vanish. All that remains is a mediocre movie that fails as a horror tale and doesn't deliver on the comedy or suspense either. The jokes are cheap, the backstory of the menace is never told -aside from a vague nonsensical explanation of their creation and a very mainstream motivation for their actions- and the overly open ending just adds more salt to the wound of finishing watching a movie that promised so much and not only failed to become a milestone of modern horror, but also fell way short of being a thrilling watch.",4,2,2,24 July 2019
Split," The long way back
","Shyamalan can't find his way back home. The slow burning thriller formula that gave him success with gems such us 'The sixth sense' or 'Signs' is lost in the tides of a distant past, tides that have made the Indian director drift away into a sea of mediocrity.In 'Split' he tries to bring back some of those traits that defined his early works. He reaches for a clever horror thriller, but all his efforts produce nothing but an average 'psycho kidnaps girls' movie with delusions of greatness. What promised to be a thoughtful journey through human mind finally develops into a watered-down showcase of Kevin's multiple personalities, having barely two of them some impact on the story.Kudos to James McAvoy for single handedly keeping afloat a movie that tries so hard to sink. His outstanding performance might be the only thing keeping viewers in their seats until the film's finale, which makes as little sense as the erratic and incoherent behavior of the three girls during the whole kidnapping. Betty Buckley manages to deliver a satisfactory portrait of Dr. Karen Fletcher amongst a very little cast where the rest of the actors (and specially actresses) do a terrible job.It may well be time for Shyamalan to find the way to travel the long way back he seems to have started with 'Split', or give a shot to something completely new, but this generic approach on horror clichés (like in this film or 'The Visit') won't satisfy his fans.",5,1,9,6 April 2017
Climax," Wicked nothingness
","Let's start by making something crystal clear: I'm not a big fan of gore, torture, snuff or such kind of content in cinema. Not that it disturbs me or freaks me out. I'm simply not particularly fond of it, but I've enjoyed my share of it when it serves a purpose. Unfortunately, in Climax Gaspar Noé has no story to tell, no message to deliver, just a poor, weak excuse of a remotely imaginative concept to let loose on the screen an increasingly annoying collection of sexual graphic scenes, violent imagery and deranged acts that feel out of place even in the context of the movie. It's just a lazy effort to get all avant-garde critics to come out of their shells and claim it's a bold take from a brave director, a raw experience showing the true nature of humans and whatnot. The truth is that besides the interesting cinematography and a solid music score that fits the film perfectly (although gets a bit tedious after a while) there's nothing else to salvage from a film so meaningless and empty it could only produce an equally empty review.",2,0,2,17 April 2019
A Quiet Place," Great effort killed by its inconsistency
","'A quiet place' is a film that revolves around a concept as interesting as dangerous. While making a film that can (or shouldn't) include any dialogue or loud noises allows for the use of shocking and interesting sound effects, it's almost impossible to get it through without breaking a couple rules for the sake of advancing the story or creating more thrilling situations. Even so, John Krasinski manages to produce a very atmospheric and well wrapped first half, staying somewhat loyal to the rules of the universe he has created, and avoiding at all cost the excesive use of jumpscares. The photography and directing is really good, and even though the VFX aren't anything extraordinary and the creatures' design looks pretty lame, we never get the feeling of being watching a cheap movie, and the spectator can enjoy the silent and tense atmosphere and the characters, which are very well acted and easy to care for, even with the little character development a film with barely no dialogue allows.But the film breaks its premise halfway through, and starts to rely too much on histrionic events, unlikely behaviours and unbeliavable measures. From matresses soundproofing entire rooms, to newborns staying silent under really uncomfortable conditions, or piles of corn defying all rules of physics, the film starts travelling downhill at light speed, rushing towards and ending that will leave most thinking minds wondering how a pack of blind, slowish creatures (and not so many of them by the looks of it) that are sensitive to loud sound waves and can be killed with a single shotgun shot overran the military of any country, let alone (apparently) the whole world. If that wasn't enough, Krasinski decides that instead of going for an open ending, its even better to simply cut the film in the middle of its climax and give absolutely no conclusion at all, effectively destroying all the good work done up to the point.In the end, 'A quiet place' feels like nothing but a wasted effort, a horror/adventure movie which could have brought a whole new level to the genre but ended falling for the same cheap tricks most such movies use for pure shock value.",5,7,13,21 June 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Love in the time of holocaust
","Taika Waititi really is an odball. Some people hate him, some people love him, most don't even know what to think of him. For me, he's a director I always kept an eye on. His basic, silly humor was exactly my kind of thing, the canvas he painted it on... not so much. So when I heard he was working on a film revolving around the third Reich, it sounded like a great opportunity to finally put all that witful but weird humor to good use.And it certainly was. 'Jojo Rabbit' is full of incredibly satisfying dark goofy moments. A satire they called it. Can't say it is. Taika tackles the nazi regime and the holocaust too lightly and the criticism isn't poignant enough to tag it as such. 'He falls short', said the critics, 'he is not bold enough'. Probably right. But the result of Taika's tameness is a wonderful comedy drama enjoyable by parents and children alike. Because a comedy it is and a comedy it remains, for the most part. But when the plot develops and the drama strikes, 'Jojo Rabbit' turns into the most heart-warming and at the same time heart-wrenching film of recent years.Content aside little is there to say about Taika's last work, and all of it good. The directing is magisterial, with a perfect pace and visuals that make it hard to remember you're not watching one of Wes Anderson's masterpieces. And the cast shines so much on the screen as it did as a list of names on the title's credits. One after another, they all bring all their best into the table, regardless the importance of the role. That makes even more unbelievable the fact that a twelve year old newcomer could come and take advantage of playing the leading role to outshine a whole cast of acting titans. Roman Griffin Davis interacts with virtually every other character on the show, and his chemistry with every one of them is truly mesmerizing.In a generally weak year for cinema there's no doubt that alongside Bong Joon Ho's 'Parasite' and Todd Phillips' 'Joker', 'Jojo Rabbit' is one of 2019's crown jewels. But while the sooner stands out for its beautiful cinematography and its almost flawless original script and the latter relies too much on Joaquin Phoenix's stellar performance, Taika's odd dark nazi comedy might be the most solid overall of the three.",8,5,6,26 February 2020
