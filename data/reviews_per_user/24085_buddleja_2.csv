The Sound of Music," How could you not like it?
","Okay, the Sound Of Music (SOM) is not a masterpiece of cinema but it serves the purpose of entertainment with its jolly tunes, beautiful scenery and memorable characters. It's popularity as a movie has only increased with the years and, deservedly so. Go to Salzburg and you can see the places the movie was filmed! Tours run from the town centre which, alas, I could not fit in when visiting in 2004. There is little that is unpalatable about SOM except for the occasional flight of overacting from the junior members of the cast. But, in some ways that only adds to the ebullience and enthusiasm the movie radiates on so many levels. Everyone should view it at least once.",8,5,15,13 June 2004
Troy," Flawed Chick Flick
","Troy could have been better. The movie is basically another vehicle for Brad Pitt to flex his muscles. Casting him as Achilles is fine enough but then giving Achilles superhuman abilities beyond his invulnerability was an enormous dollop of artistic licence which detracted from the movie. Sure, I didn't expect the movie to be historically accurate but hyperbole was everywhere throughout the film. Bright points included Peter O'Toole as King Priam - what an amazing actor- and Helen (whom I doubt would have been a blue eyed blond haired Grecian beauty - but hey genetic outliers happen, just like Hector and his wife's child having blue eyes while both parents were dark eyed), who was definitely a beauty and elegantly regretful as the catalyst for war. Certainly a spectacular movie, although we've now seen massive army 'flyovers' since Lord Of The Rings and it gets boring playing 'spot the non-digitised characters'. Nice try, but no cigar from this reviewer.",Null,2,5,13 June 2004
