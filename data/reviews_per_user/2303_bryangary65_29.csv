Blade Runner 2049," Better than original

It," It's Ok
","Mainly targeted to a teenage audience Some scary moments, and all built up to what I presume will be a sequel",7,0,0,13 June 2018
Hereditary," No Classic
",No where near good as the hype would have you believe Entertaining enough if you haven't listened to the critics telling you it's a great horror Some of the acting reminded me of the old Hammer films of the 60s/70s and that's not a compliment!,7,0,1,1 July 2018
Rocketman," More a firework than a Rocket
",Interesting but slightly biased interpretation of the great mans life.Music is good and plenty of it. Would describe the experience as a darker version of Mamma Mia but without the beautiful scenery,7,0,5,26 May 2019
A Star Is Born," 5 stars
","Very good and a terrific soundtrackGreat chemistry between Cooper and Ga Ga, with the latter sounding great and Bradley surprisingly very good musically",8,5,9,30 October 2018
Darkest Hour," Our finest hour
","A film about two men Winston Churchill and Gary OldmanThe former a prime minister who we owe our life's to and the latter who gives the performance of his career in portraying the legendary figureIt's all about the words, some are inspired and some are emotional..but never ever boring",8,4,5,13 November 2018
Us," Us or Them?

Thor: Ragnarok," Thor is not ..Corr
","All pretty silly, and aimed at a teenage audience Acting is pretty poor from the star names as they ham their roles up. However thought Cate Blanchett as the baddie was convincing enough It's entertaining I suppose if you let your brain cells have a couple of hours off, though think the CGI looked liked it was CGI!",7,1,4,24 July 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fun

Justice League," Not in a League of its own
","It's all a bit of fun, as normal with these super hero films targeting the teenagers market.Visually it looked quite impressive. Acting wise thought Affleck was a very uncomfortable Batman and the talents of Amy Adams was wasted in her part as Lois.Loved though Gal Gadot as Wonder Women, she has a presence whenever on the screen.",7,0,0,8 August 2018
Dunkirk," Part of our History
","Film not as good as hype would have you believe.Visually though it's a stunning watch, and enjoyed the soundtrack by Zimmer.No Saving Private Ryan,but decent enough.",7,1,3,13 May 2018
A Quiet Place," Everyone in Cinema sat Quiet!
","Very tense film despite small cast.The Aliens were menacing though would describe film more of a thriller than a horror.Emily Blunt was very good, as were the child actors. A good night out is assured,if you go and see this movie",8,3,6,9 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Peaceful

The Godfather: Part III," Understand the need for 111
","Not a patch on one or two,but still worth a watch.Script a bit far fetched and pace of film hit and miss. However still enjoyed it and Al Pacino is always good.

Downfall," Fascinating
","Drama about the last days of Hitler, and the mayhem that was going on around him in Berlin as the city was about to fall.Grim viewing at times but overall a film that keeps you interested from start to finish.",8,1,1,7 October 2019
American Gangster," Masterclass
",..of acting by Washington & CroweEngrossing story and visually excellent,7,1,3,25 September 2019
Arrival," When you arrive at start don't leave

Black Panther," Not a panther just a cat
