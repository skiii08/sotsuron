Requiem for a Dream," ****10/10****
","This is one of the best movies i have ever seen. Great directing, awesome music, filming and plot. But i think this is not a movie about the negative affects of drugs. The drug addiction in this movie is not the main story. It is a metaphor; a symbol, for nearly the entire world. It shows, that people are hopelessly lost in their way of life, in their dreams and what they believe. Whatever they try to do to fulfil their dreams wont work. They are all leaving in a dreamworld, and among each other, they can tell themselves that everything is ok and fine to relieve their minds. Until reality catches up with them. 10/10",Null,0,0,9 January 2003
Fight Club," One of the best movies ever!
","What can i say. A++. ==mindchanging=> In my opinion, this movie has one of the best endings in filmhistory (Near Death Experience) besides the endings in Fearless, Jacobs Ladder, 12 Monkeys, The Game, Baraka, etc...Made by a genius with the intension to develop the human spirit in our world.
