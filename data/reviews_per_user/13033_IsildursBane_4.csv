Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Simply exquisite
","I loved this film!  The complete twist of what Star Wars was before Luke Skywalker and Han Solo's story was spectacular.  George Lucas is a powerful genius. It is so awesome that Lucas did the last story first, and the first story last!  Liam Neeson was great in this movie.  It's one of the best performances he's ever given!  Jake Lloyd did a great job portraying young Anakin Skywalker.  I thought the special effects were the best ever used in a motion picture.  The pod race was amazingly subperb!  The pod racers themselves were so amazing.The lightsaber fights were much more better than the ones used in the original film.  The costumes were so awesome.  But the makeup used on Queen Amidala was so spectacular!  I can't believe this movie was actually pulled off at all!  I can not wait untill Episode 2!",9,0,0,1 June 1999
Training Day," Takes you for a neat ride... and then keeps going when it should have stopped.
","*** o/o **** 'Training Day' is a Drama/Thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua (Bait, The Replacement Killers) and stars Oscar winner Denzel Washington (Remember the Titans, The Hurricane, Glory) and Ethan Hawke (Michael Almereyda's Hamlet, Snow Falling on Cedars, Great Expectations) It is released by Warner Bros. at a running time of 120 min.  It is rated R for brutal violence, persuasive language, drug content, and brief nudity. The basic story is as follows: Jake Hoyt (Hawke) is a husband and father who has been a cop for 18 months.  He is training to be a narcotics officer.  On his training day he is assigned to Alonzo Harris who will show him the ropes.  Alonzo at some times is bitter but at other times is fun.  But Jake is surprised when he finds out how Alonzo is corrupt and conniving.  And soon Jake is intertwined in Alonzo's plan to deliver a large sum of money after a mistake made with the Russian Mafia. First of all this movie is performance based... the script doesn't give it any oomph and neither is the direction anything special.  It is simply wonderful performances by Washington and Hawke (though Hawke will most likely be overlooked by Washington).  The movie is paced very well at the beginning with Hawke waking up and meeting Denzel... then we get the intensity point as they go from bust to bust.  There are surprisingly impressive cameos by Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray that also push the movie along.  Scott Glenn also gives a worthwhile performance as Roger, Alozo's 'supposed' friend.  1 hr. 40 mins. in I was thinking, whoa that was one of the best endings I have ever seen!  And then the movie continued.
This is the movies fatal flaw... it should have quit when it was ahead... hell, I might have given it an extra half of a star if it had ended then but it all boiled up to a rooftop jumping and then loud ending. Academy Potential: I am deeming this much too violent for the Academy to choose Denzel for a Best Actor nomination.  It's just to much of an action flick to be considered... it would be like nominating Stallone for 'Cliffhanger'. While the film has a horrible flaw... it's still enjoyable to watch the stars in brilliant performances.  So the movie isn't completely wasted, just less than expected.",Null,1,11,27 October 2001
Memento," Dont be afraid...
","Don't be afraid to let this film take you over.  Don't consider leaving the theatre after the first five minutes assuming that you know everything, because unless it's been spoiled for you, you don't know the twists yet to come. Don't be afraid to think.  You are set up with these choices:Pearl HarborThe AnimalMementoI chose Memento.  If you are willing to sit through this and let your mind be sucked into the plot full of intrigue and twists, then you will love this movie.  If you don't want to think, go see The Animal.  If you want something with a plastic plot, go see Pearl Harbor.  If you look at the Memento page, you'll notice that it is # 12 on the viewers greatest films of all time.  It was also deemed the best movie of the year in the MARCH! issue of Total Movie.  Richard Roeper said that it was the best movie of the year so far.  It is the Sundance winner for Best Screenplay.  And it is the best reviewed film this year.Don't be afraid to laugh, cry, fish, swim, drink, eat, blow your nose, wink, blink, think...OH F**K, JUST GO SEE THE DAMN MOVIE!",Null,0,1,10 June 2001
U-571," O.K., but not very promising... (Warning:Spoiler)
","This film is for people who are expecting good action.  Well, unfortunately, that's almost all that there is... action.  The performances are less than expected.  I especially disliked the Tank's performance.  He seems to be delivering his lines as if he's reading them strait from the screenplay. You like to dislike some characters, but to a certain extent.  The character we most dislike in the film is a German prisoner.  But they do too much with the character.  Bill Pullman's character is also a character to dislike. But instead of giving us a chance to get to know him, they kill him in the first act.  The reactions in this film are not too realistic.  And also from what I've heard, the history is also a little off.I'm not saying don't see the film... but historians and people with a love for compelling movies, think before you see this.*** out of ****",7,0,1,20 June 2000
