The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Are you, Are you / Coming to the Tree
","Strange things did happen here No stranger would it be.Amazing movie that so many times made me wanna get up of my seat and sing/fight/cry with the characters. The review started with an amazing song written by Suzanne Collins and sung by Jennifer Lawrence in the movie. The movie is the first part but fortunately it has a 'closure' now all we have to do is wait for the next one. I'll put the lyrics of the song here because my review is over but i need at least 10 lines to send:Are you, are you Coming to the tree Where the dead man called out for his love to flee Strange things did happen here No stranger would it be If we met up at midnight in the hanging treeAre you, are you Coming to the tree Where I told you to run, so we'd both be free Strange things did happen here No stranger would it be If we met up at midnight in the hanging treeAre you, are you Coming to the tree Wear a necklace of rope, side by side with me Strange things did happen here No stranger would it be If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree",8,11,39,22 November 2014
