Blade Runner 2049," A visual masterpiece that fails to engage
","As a fan of Villeneuve, Deakins and most of the cast I was looking forward to this. Villeneuve repeats his style of slow-pan drawn-out tension, as he's accompanied by the majestic touches of Roger Deakins in completing the feel of each shot.We are drawn into the flawlessly created Blade Runner world, where we seek a story that will keep us on the edge of our seat, longing for more. Unfortunately, that just wasn't fulfilled. Any anticipation was lost in the pace.I cannot fault the world that was created, nor can I fault the plot which was solid enough. It's the pace of the film that loses some of the audience. In the cinema I was in the tension gave way to boredom for many viewers. A couple of people walked out about mid-way, whilst there was a restlessness about many who remained.For those who are determined to see this, strap in for a long, long ride. Try your very best to immerse yourself and enjoy the visual feast but don't expect the film to deliver on the hype of the trailer. It's a slow burn that isn't for everyone.",4,20,51,4 October 2017
