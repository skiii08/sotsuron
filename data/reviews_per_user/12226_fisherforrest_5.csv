The Sound of Music," Corn never gets any better than this.
","Some critics have labelled it corn, but if it is, you'll never find a better variety. What more can you want? A beautiful cast, pleasant music, and fabulous scenery in the Austrian alps. Oh, sure, the camera is mostly very static, not much better than the Italian 1913 version of THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII. Perhaps the Todd AO process camera was unwieldy,or perhaps the director just liked it that way. As for Julie Andrews, what other actress can all at the same time project vulnerability, strength, and emotional fire? There cannot be too many such. Eleanor Parker has a thankless role as a possible wife for the von Trapp paterfamilias, but we know from the start that she hasn't a prayer up against Maria, the postulant sent out from a nearby convent as governess for the von Trapp family seven kids. Just the same, Eleanor displays her usual talent and is an ornament to the film. At the end, as the family flees the Nazi anschluss into Austria, we finally get some action and a little camera movement, with tracking shots. Whatever cavils one may rake up, this is Julie Andrews' film, no question.",8,3,10,8 September 2002
As Good as It Gets," Not your usual 'romantic comedy', but there are some 'screwballs' loose here.
","If this is really a romantic comedy, as some say, it surely isn't one the directors of that genre in the 1930's would recognise. It is a comedy of a sort. Checkov would likely think so, but don't expect to roll around on the floor trying to stifle guffaws. Perhaps a grin now and then may be in order. Almost every character, the mother of 'Carol' is one exception, leads a life of desperation, but not 'quietly'. Even the dog looks rather desperate, and he isn't quiet either. 'In the dark night of the soul' it really is three o'clock in the morning for these people most of the time. I can't recall chuckling even once, but still I was wryly amused. Probably this was a case of 'enjoying' the other guy's misery. No doubt a human trait. The 'thank the gods, I'm not like that' syndrome, eh? It may sound like I didn't like this movie, but that is not the case at all. The entire cast is fully up to the task of putting the story across, but I derived the most enjoyment from the broad spectrum of women characters, beginning with Helen Hunt, of course, but going down to the briefest of walk-on bit player glimpses. Where did the director find them all? My only cavil is that it seemed the editor was doing his best to sabotage the project. Maybe he was just being modern. Whatever, I owe the film a debt of gratitude for introducing me to Helen Hunt. She really brings 'Carol' to life as a real person whom it would be an interesting experience to meet. With any luck, without the asthmatic son. You don't want too many complications, do you?",9,1,1,5 May 2006
U-571," Guaranteed to raise your blood pressure and pulse.
","If, by chance, this film doesn't send your pulse and blood pressure up into the red, you have nothing to worry about. You're already dead! If, as some pundit said, adventure is some other guy or guys in a hell of a fix a long way from where you are, then this film represents adventure with a very large capital A. Briefly, the crew of an old S-boat (late WW1 vintage submarine) in 1942 is charged with capturing a disabled German U-boat in the Atlantic in order to get the coding machine known as Enigma. With this, the allies would be able to track U-boat positions and deployments, and slow the terrific loss of allied shipping. They do get control of U-571, but their own sub is sunk by another German sub, forcing the boarding party to save themselves in the all-but-sinking U-571. They manage to do so in spite of a later attack by a German destroyer, and keep U-571 afloat long enough to get rescued in the western approaches.I won't even attempt to detail the horrific ordeal of these guys portrayed in a non-stop succession of special effects not seen in any previous submarine flics. Not just the sea and hostile enemy vessels assail the remnant of the S-boat's crew, but also there is dissension in their ranks, a commanding officer liked but not entirely trusted by all the crew, and the captive German captain of U-571 who manages to get loose. When the sinking U-571 begins the plan to sink the attacking German destroyer, you will certainly inch forward on the couch! Not just the amazing special effects but ingenious and seamless editing add to the non-stop thrills. The fact that the characters are believable and well portrayed adds to the general quality.But, you must keep in mind that the story thus unfolded is fiction. Allied crews did retrieve Enigma machines from U-110 in 1941 and U-505 in 1944, but not in the way shown here. I would venture the opinion that what we are shown would have been impossible, though some submarine crews did manage to survive some really difficult situations, both in peacetime and war. Some critics have complained that the scene early in the film showing the crew of U-571 machine gunning a boatload of allied survivors is manipulative. Maybe so, but fairly late in the war in the South Atlantic the crew of a German sub did just that to the crew of a merchant vessel they had sunk. It is a well documented case. Regard this film as a high adventure tale with convincing special effects and you should find it enjoyable. Regard it as history and you will have trouble suspending your disbelief.",8,0,2,26 October 2002
American Beauty," Is this really what life is like in the USA at the beginning of the 20th century?
","'What we have got here is a failure to communicate!' That's mainly what I derived from watching this worm's eye view of a 'typical' (?) moderately affluent neighbourhood. Apart from one household consisting of two homosexual males who seem fairly well adjusted to life, every other one in view is totally dysfunctional. Could that hint at an 'agenda' on the part of writer or director? The film could be viewed as 'Chekovian' comedy perhaps, but the eminent Russian's characters while living lives of quiet (mostly) desperation at least maintained some hope for the future. You could say they 'tried'. Or perhaps it is a 'modern film noir'. Certainly, almost all the characters are losers. 'Lester Burnham' may have 'turned his life around' as has been said, but if so it was in a direction of almost certain ultimate chaos. Only 'Angela Hayes', late-teenage girl friend of 'Lester's' daughter 'Jane' seems capable of salvaging something from the mess.One could explore the bleak aspects of the other characters: 'Jane', totally estranged from her parents in supposedly 'typical' teenage fashion, wife 'Carolyn' who just occupies the same house as her husband 'Lester' without actually 'living' with him, or 'Col.Frank Fitts, U.S.Marine Corps', a repressed homosexual whose brutal treatment of his family is graphically displayed, or finally his son, who has 'coped' with life by becoming a voyeur and very successful drug dealer. Only in this last case are we shown the root causes of these dysfunctions. This is not what I would charaterise as a 'positive' film.There are some rewards, though, in spite of the foregoing negative comments, which derive from my personal dislike of films which emphasise the worst aspects of life. The tawdry and sordid, much beloved by William Faulkner who could well have written this script, are not high on my list of preferences. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening give outstanding performances with many nuances which limn their characters. The rest of the cast seem 'over the top' to me, but, but what the heck?!. In a film like this, subtlety might go unnoticed.",6,0,0,7 June 2002
The Patriot," It's an exciting example of historical fiction
","The main foreground characters and action are mostly fiction, but the spirit of the partisan actions in the Carolinas during the Civil War is honestly stated. 'Benjamin Martin', a veteran of the French and Indian Wars, in which he apparently committed some acts of which he is now ashamed, is reluctant to get involved in the American rebellion against British rule. He has a large family of which he is very fond and caring. When a very over zealous and sadistic British colonel murders his next to oldest son, he goes berserk. Single-handed, he kills a patrol of 20 solders and frees his captive oldest son. After that, he becomes a partisan leader and there is no stopping him.We see the English campaign in the Carolinas mostly through 'Benjamin Martin', and we follow him to the final defeat of Cornwallis. The 'Martin' family affairs are fiction, but there is little doubt that tragic incidents like those portrayed, i.e. house burnings, killing of civilians, etc. actually occurred. The character 'Martin' is probably based in part on the real life partisan Francis Marion, famous as 'The Swamp Fox'. Along with several other similar guerrilla leaders, Marion dealt the redcoats some serious blows, similar to those portrayed in the film.I found this an excellent semi-docudrama, with the fictional family serving as a canvas on which to paint the hellishness of war, even in a good cause. Direction, editing and production values are all very good, supported by equally good cast work.",9,1,3,2 December 2004
