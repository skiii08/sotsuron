Black Swan," I hated most of the film it, but when it finished I actually liked it.
","The last ten minutes of the film are thrilling but the 90 ones leading to the end are disappointing. Sometimes I felt confused, other just bored, but never scared (it was supposed to be a horror film, at least in the Spanish advertising) I just wondered 'Where is all the cool stuff I saw in the trailer?'. When you come to the end everything makes senses but I kept asking why it took that long to arrive there. And I found the film quite predictable. The Ballet company it's similar to Verhoeven's Showgirls.The use of the camera is horrendous. It has that shaky feeling that makes me dizzy, which could be clever in some situations (when Nina is running away in panic, but not when she is walking on the NY's streets in the first part of the film). When Nina is the only character on screen (a that happens lots of times) the camera is too close to her and in some shots looked pretentious. Natalie Portman is impressive. Nina is a challenging role and she give us an acting lesson and gets a well deserved Oscar. She is the true reason to watch the film. No complaints with rest of the cast.Nice soundtrack, but it's just a smart use of Thaikovski's work. And when it comes to the sex scenes some more nude flesh would be welcome. Don't what to show Natalie's breast? That's OK, just use a suggestive camera angle. But take her bra out please. I mean, you don't do it with your clothes on, do you?",4,0,0,10 September 2011
