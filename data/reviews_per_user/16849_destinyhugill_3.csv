Casablanca," Great Acting!
","After hearing all of the hype surrounding this film my expectations were set rather high, but after i finally sat down and watched this film i was kind of let down. While this film was a bit of a let down it was still somewhat interesting to watch. This film had great acting from both the main and supporting actors who really seemed to give it there all to portray these characters perfectly but that was the only part of this movie that really blew me away. The plot was somewhat interesting but moved a little to slow in my opinion. Overall this film is way over hyped and in my opinion should not be considered on of the best films ever made.",5,4,7,15 December 2015
Citizen Kane," such a let down
","This movie is voted one of the best movies of all time by critics and i just don't understand why. The only good part of this movie was the great cinematography but that alone cant make a movie great. Every other aspect of the movie was boring. The actors were awful and the characters they played were even worse, i couldn't identify with any of them. The worst part of this movie was with out a doubt the plot, this movie was told mostly in flashbacks and could not hold my interest.This film also just went on and on and was way overdone.Overall this movie was visually pleasing but every other aspect of it just made this movie unbearable to watch.",1,13,25,15 December 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Great movie
",Musicals have never been a favorite genre of mine in fact I found them to be rather boring but this film changed my view of them for the better. The colors were bold and daring and made the movie feel modern. The musical numbers themselves were catchy and fun so they were bearable to watch. The dancing was a bit to over the top for me but it flowed well with the film and did make it more entertaining to watch. The actors did a great job and due to that this movie was enjoyable to watch. Lastly the plot was simple enough to be easily followed. Overall I really enjoyed all of the aspects of this film and it was a lot more entertaining than I had anticipated which was a pleasant surprise. I would defiantly recommend this to any one with an interest in musicals.,9,1,3,18 December 2015
