Minority Report," Wow!
","I have rarely seen a film so cleverly written. Adapted from a short story from Philip K Dick (who also wrote the books on which Blade Runner and Total Recall are based) this has been turned into a full length story that grips your attention with no breaksTom Cruise is just wonderful. Yes, I'll say that again. Tom Cruise is wonderful! And I don't care how clever you are - you will NOT see the twist coming. It will hit you and you'll go, 'What?!!'Spielberg's created another winner!",Null,0,0,30 October 2002
My Neighbor Totoro," Just for kids?
","I've never made a scret of the fact that I like children's tales. I was an avid reader when I was younger; Enid Blyton and C S Lewis are writers whose books still hold my attentionChildren's films play a big part in our family as well. We have most of the popular Disney films as well as things like Babe, Antz and Beethoven, etcSo was it for this reason that a friend insisted on sending me My Neighbour Totoro, citing it as one of his favourite films?I finally watched it last night, not having the slightest idea what it was or what it was about. What I got was a heart-warming, beautifully drawn and - well - decidely odd animated film from JapanTwo young Japanese sisters and their father move into a run-down shack in a rice-field area where they meet several 'fairy tale' characters lving in the local woods, including the titular, Totoro, a giant - erm - gerbil. While having adventures with him and his smaller friends, they discover that their hospitalised Mother, due home soon, has developed an illness. The younger sister runs away to find the hospital and Totoro assists in the searchWhether this Totoro is a well known character in Japan (like - what? - the tooth fairy, or Father Christmas over here) or not I'm afraid I don't know. But the film is presented in such a way that you should know who the hell these characters areNow, as an adult, I found the film very touching. The fact that it was in Japanese with English sub-titles didn't bother me. But its obvious intended audience (i.e my children) would be hard pressed to sit through it purely because of that reason; however, the simple tale of innocent children exploring their new locations is one that should and, indeed, would appeal to my younger boysI must confess that I didn't share my friend's obvious joy in finding such a film - but then I wouldn't expect him to sit through my favourite 'Krull' every month or so. But, as I said, it's beautifully drawn (apart from the Japanese habit of, for some reason, insisting that all children have mouths as wide as water melons!!), the music is surprisingly pleasant and the overall effect is one of feeling warm and fuzzy at the end, if a little bemused",8,0,1,30 October 2002
Blade II," Will the sequel live up to expectations?
","I really enjoyed the original film and, knowing how disappointing sequels can be, I didn't hold out too much hope for Blade II... which meant that I was pleasantly surprisedObviously spending far more money on effects than plot, the producers have realised what made the original so popular, i.e. the fight sequences. OK, so the CGI effects are a little lame at times, but Wesley Snipes is his usual cool self, strutting around with an almost Dali-esque airThe story (or what there is of it) concerns Blade teaming up with vampires to battle a mutant race of blood suckers but that never intrudes upon what is the main reason for watching (although the mutants themselves are splendid, almost like something out of a Clive Barker novel). Blade II is now on my list of 'must buy' DVDs",Null,0,0,30 October 2002
Taxi Driver," This may shock film fans...
","I watched Taxi Driver for the first time last night. The video box called it one of the most powerful films in motion picture history. I call it one of the dullest things I've ever seenJodie Foster made the film for me; the rest of it just seemed to be a rambling, incoherent ride in the back of a cab!!",2,0,3,30 October 2002
Apocalypse Now," Lives up to expectations
","Apocalypse Now is a film everybody should watch at least once. I'm no fan of films about the Vietnam War; Platoon and Hamburger Hill I really did not like. But AN is different. Not concentrating too much on the battles, it's the story of one man's search for a renegade GeneralMartin Sheen, who plays the 'searcher' (does Charlie look like his Dad or what!), is nothing short of superb! He's not even a hero - he's a man with many inner demons. His journey along the river to find the General (Marlon Brando, who doesn't appear until the last fifteen minutes yet practically dominates the film) is also a journey within himself, full of danger, sadness and even humour (vis the 'surfing' story which had me laughing out loud). The final fifteen harrowing minutes is masterful. Early work from both Laurence Fishburne and Harrison Ford adds interest",8,0,0,30 October 2002
Black Hawk Down," It has all the right ingredients, but...
","If you were to ask for a great director to direct a great war film, you may ask Ridley Scott to direct Black Hawk Down. He is a great director and Black Hawk Down is a great war film...But...The problem with war films is that you've seen 'em all. It's about good guys vs bad guys and heroes and shooting. The fact that Black Hawk Down is set in Somalia is the only thing that makes this different from, for example, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan or Hamburger HillUN Peacekeeping forces are under attack in the Somalian civil war of the early 90s. The good ol' USA send in their 'elite' troops to counter. The motto of these guys is that they shall never leave a fallen comrade behind, so when one of their Black Hawk helicopters crashes right in the middle of a hostile zone, it's all hands on deck to get any survivors outWhat then follows is an archetypal battle with the 'good guys' being able to shoot straight and the 'bad guys' missing with every other shot. It's beautifully filmed, as you would expect, and with sufficient gore to ensure its realism. The surreal moments as (some of) the soldiers reach the safe zone is possibly the best part of the film, but one is left with an uncomfortable feeling when the epilogue glibly states that 20 American soldiers lost their lives (it lists their names) - oh yes, and so did 1000 SomaliansThe acting is great, the music is great, the story is great; one can even forgive the patriotism. But there's nothing new to see hereI'm glad I watched it - but I'm equally glad I borrowed it rather than bought it",Null,0,0,30 October 2002
High Fidelity," At last - a love story for the lads!
","I've not read nor seen any film based on books by Nick Hornby. Perhaps I should. High Fidelity at last gives us a love story from a guy's perspective, complete with angst, compassion, self pity and sexRob Gordon (the ever dependable John Cusack) is a record store owner and a compulsive 'list' maker. Talking to the camera, he recounts his five worst relationship break-ups, including his latest one; he then realises his need to contact each of these previous ladies to see if he can establish where he went wrongIn addition, the day to day life at the record store goes onNow, this may sound bland and uninteresting, but it is, in fact, a remarkably poignant and compulsive look at the male ego and how it stands up to rejection. And while it doesn't deliver a massive load of belly laughs, it's quite impossible not to watch without a silly grin on your face",Null,2,4,30 October 2002
