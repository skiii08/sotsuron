Catch Me If You Can," Classical, highly recommended.
","Leonardo DiCaprio classic.
I have watched this movie, about four times now.
For me, that is a lot, spending time watching something i already have seen is something i despise. I never re-watch, i have only seen my most rated movie twice. So four times is a lot for me, this movie is special.It just has that 'DiCaprio' special feeling and Spielberg is amazing.
The movie is fulfilling to watch, there is nothing that is mind-blowing.
It just has everything needed, with no less and no more. It is just a stable film that i always enjoy watching. Truly a classical, that i would recommend anyone to watch.",9,0,1,2 January 2020
The Notebook," Wonderful, a must see.
","I watched this alone, as a Norwegian man. And, i am devastated in manly man tears. This movie touched me in places i rarely get touched, however that is not the only good thing about the film. The movie is amazing, it is a clique love film, nevertheless it does it right. I am extremely happy with this movie and it is extremely beautiful. I do recommend watching it with your respected other, however alone works just fine. I loved Ryan Goseling and he was spectacular, arguably the best film he has been in.It is a clique movie, clique love film. However, there are extremely worse clique films. And this movie feels as if they actual used effort in the making. Where other movies base there entire movie on some clique ending that is expected with low quality in every other regard this movie is different. Helped by the main characters.",7,1,2,5 September 2019
The Babadook," Actually scary.
","I mostly don't get scared from horror movies, however this movie left me with chills when i tried to sleep.The only mistake, or, what i would change is the ending.
This is a horror movie and everyone lived happily ever after.
It still made me question what lies in the dark parts of my room, something almost no horror movies have ever done. The acting is also good, however the filming and lighting could be better.",5,2,3,27 August 2019
Hot Fuzz," If you liked 'Shaun of the Dead' don't watch this.
","I thought this movie would be funny, it is a comedy is it not? Well, comedies are supposed to have humour, where this movie fails. I liked 'Shaun of the Dead' but this, this is rubbish.This is not something i would watch drunk, wasted or before bed. I wish i could erase this movie from my mind and shiet on it. I honestly felt devastated watching this, because i love Simon Pegg. Nevertheless, save your brain by not watching this. There are much better brain-dead movies and shows.If you liked 'Shaun of the Dead' don't watch this. Just stupid, and not in a good way.",1,2,9,4 September 2019
Yes Man," Don't say Yes to a movie about saying Yes!
","Jim Carrey played his characther good, not at the level of 'The Mask' but he was good.",2,0,3,27 August 2019
Ready Player One," Extremely disappointing.
","The book is wonderful, i loved the book.However, the movie is not comparable to the book. The film is so clique and looks extremely cheaply done and the CGI is so bad. The movie could have been better if it did not target such low aged viewers. Good guy from rags, fighting against the evil that at the end sees that he is evil.It gives us an in-sight into what the future could be, however some aspects are so unrealistic and i wish it was done different and more focused on what the book actually was.It does feel like the director and writers did not read the actual book and or just rushed trough it forgetting what the original author actually wanted to show the readers.A lot of potential, so disappointing. Can be enjoyed for kids, however this is not comparable to the book.",3,0,0,5 September 2019
Suicide Squad," Bad Writing, Acting and CGI.
","The concept in my mind is bad. And the movie, the movie was not really funny or good. It was quite brain-dead and sometimes that is fine, therefore i regretted watching this movie. Will Smith is really bad in this movie and is without doubt the lowest point in his career. I could maybe respect the movie if it at least was funny and the action was good. But the ending fight and or all other fights were not really that memorial and good to start with.Low effort movie that movie that they knew would make money. It is focused against kids that don't know what a good movie is.",1,0,0,5 September 2019
Life of Pi," Beautiful movie.
","It was wonderful, incredible and the interpretation of the movie might differ. Nevertheless, the movie is a must watch.",7,0,1,27 August 2019
Full Metal Jacket," A Full Metal Jacket.
","It is realistic and shows the reality and pointlessness of war. Countless of victims of politics, where nothing gets achieved. Nothing was gained from the war and the war itself is a victim of politics. The movie shows the horror of that fact extremely well.Even the name of the movie is solid and is a plot-twist in the movie. I love it when movies actively use their own movie name during the movie.The ending was the worst part of the movie and was a little bit too slow. Featuring no real fulfilment after watching the movie, except the horros of war.",7,0,1,27 August 2019
Baby Driver," The start is good, however it goes downhill.
","It feels like they used all there money and energy into the iconic start scene. Everything works and everything is perfect at the start.However, after sometime everything just falls downhill. Everything just goes off-track, and it feels like the first scenes were one director and the rest was another.",3,2,3,27 August 2019
The Thing," One of the best horror movies ever.
","After almost 40 years, i believe this is one of the best still. Most of the new horror movies are mostly ' with repetitive money hungry templates.'The Thing' might not be that scary anymore, however the concept is scary, the concept is terrifying.If you respect the classics and enjoy a good movie.
This is a movie you should watch.",7,3,4,27 August 2019
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Stupid, Pointless and yeah, a bit funny.
","The movie has Steve Carell and that is the main reasoned for me watching it in the first place. I do regret watching the movie, it was quite boring and had some lines here and there that were actually funny.This movie has noting special, and it is not particular funny, it has it's moments, nevertheless i do regret wasting time watching it. I did watch it before bed and it helped with my sleeping problems.I do not think the movie could be any better, the concept itself is not that good. You can't have anything more, and it questions why i watched a movie with this title.Some funny moments, nevertheless i did not laugh.",1,1,4,27 August 2019
The Intouchables," French Masterpiece.
","This is the perfect movie, this is beautiful.
It is wholesome, re-watchable, brilliant and lovely.
Such a french masterpiece. Extremely unique, and it is one of the few movies i have watched that really touched me.I would recommend this movie for anyone really, don't let the language stop you. This is a movie you cannot miss, such a masterpiece.",Null,0,1,27 August 2019
War Machine," Not much special really.
","Nothing was really special about this movie. I found nothing really that enjoyable. Comparing it too other war movies like American Sniper and Full Metal Jacket this movie is lacking almost in every regard where they succeeded.Brad Pitt at this age is still a good actor. However, his facial impressions are off putting and he is not was he was a couple of years ago. This phenomenon is only found in this movie , the other recent movies like 'Allied' are extremely well acted. Nevertheless, this movie his acting was off for me, it was just not really Brad Pitt like.The movie lacked a lot, it lacked a good ending, a good plot and it really could have shown the war better. Not much was invested into the movie and it felt like a low effort movie with bad writing.",1,2,3,4 September 2019
Inside Man," Could have been so much more.
","Inside Man could have been good. The concept does feel used up and this movie did not bring anything new and special. That fact bored me while watching. When trying to review this movie in a positive way, it would be hard, because the movie is not special at all.Denzel Washington could be much better in the movie as well, and the acting all together is quite terrible in this movie. And is lacking in filming, it looks like the director shot everything once. It looks a lot like i low effort, money-hungry movie.The movie is not really memorable so i would not recommend watching this.
I regret watching it myself, and it could have been much better.",3,1,5,5 September 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Introduction to the Magical World.
","This is the first Harry Potter movie and that shows, the other ones are much better made. The movie does a good job at showing the first book, nevertheless the book is much better than the movie.This movie is more focused towards kids, and i get that, however the boss battles in this movie is not really good. There is not a battle in any sense really. Just some puzzels. The boss battles gets better towards Prisoner of Azkaban.Good soundtrack, and the acting is surprisingly well done.",Null,1,1,27 August 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," There does not exist a more perfect movie.
","After watching numerous amount of movies, a lot compares, however nothing beats The Shawshank Redemption. There is no flaw, i can think of, it has everything and it is extremely fulfilling and touching to watch.The ending also, really does it for me. I feel happy, and i feel fulfilled.
This movie is a contender for the best movie i will ever have seen, they really don't make movies like this anymore.This is why, this is the only movie that actually deserves a 10/10.
It is the closest to perfection, that i have ever witnessed in a movie.",8,2,3,3 January 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," Absolutely Amazing.
","It chooses both sides perfect, does not make anyone the enemy. Shows that war itself is the enemy. Feels like gods are fighting, not actual countries. The camera shoots are amazing, the acting is splendid. The movie depicts war as horrifying, and still manages to make an amazing war movie. Shows values and morals in a whole new way.The movie is even based on a true story, and that is just amazing. I love how you learn it at the end and not at the start.'Please help me get one more.'
Truly powerful and moving.Mel Gibson really outdone himself here.",7,0,0,31 August 2019
Sully," Well made and interesting.
","Good movie, Tom Hanks as useful was excellent.
Shows really some bad aspects about our society.The ending is not that impressive, the crash landing in the lake is the best part and the rest is not that amazing, nevertheless i liked it.",6,0,1,27 August 2019
