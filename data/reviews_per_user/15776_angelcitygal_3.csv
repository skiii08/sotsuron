Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just sit down, shut up and enjoy it
","I've now seen 'The Phantom Menace' twice.  I was lucky enough to be amongst the opening-night audience at the Chinese Theatre, which I can only describe as raucous, hilarious and surreal.  But onto the movie itself.The first time I saw 'Phantom', I enjoyed it very much, but was a bit disappointed.  I think I, like so many others, set my expectations way too high.  Then I saw it again this past weekend and just sat down to watch and enjoy a movie.  What a difference my change in attitude made.  I had such a great time and appreciated things about the film I had not noticed before.I don't want to take up too much space by listing out every little thing, but I especially loved Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman, the majorly a**-kicking lightsaber duel near the end of the movie (fabulous fight choreography), the pod race sequence and the costumes and visuals.Like most people, I was seriously annoyed by Jar Jar the first time I saw 'The Phantom Menace'.  But when I saw it again, the character did not bother me nearly as much and actually amused me several times. I think this movie improves upon further viewings.Did anyone notice the brief sound of the famous Darth Vader breathing at the very end of the credits?Can't wait for Episode II!!!",Null,0,0,1 June 1999
Beauty and the Beast," One of the best ever!
","'Beauty and the Beast' is one of the finest movies ever made.  Notice that I didn't say 'one of the finest animated movies'--it is a great film--period.I still remember how excited I was to see this movie, from the day I saw a cardboard stand-up at the local mulitplex.  I went on the night it opened, and I was moved from the haunting prologue onward.  This is the rare film that exceeded my expectations.  I've lost count of how many time I've seen it, but I did see it twelve times while it was in theatres (hey, it was out for eight months or something!).The animation is excellent, but the real key to 'Beauty''s success is its wonderfully real characters.  There is nothing false about any of them. The songs, by Howard Ashman (lyrics) and Alan Menken (music), are moving, funny and catchy.  We all lost a great treasure when Howard Ashman died.  His lyrics were never dumbed down and always clever, enjoyable for adults and children alike.Special praise also goes out to the voice cast, who infuse their character s with life and real emotion.  Before Disney starting casting voices just because they belonged to famous movie stars, they actually cast people on the basis of talent.  Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Angela Lansbury, Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, and everyone else are fabulous!I forever lost faith in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences when they gave the Oscar to 'Silence of the Lambs' instead of 'Beauty and the Beast'.This will always be one of my all-time favorites!!",10,0,0,10 August 1999
Before Sunrise," Lyrical, romantic, moving and real
","'Before Sunrise' touched me very deeply.  Jesse and Celine seem so real because Richard Linklater gives us the time to get to know them.  And because they seem so real to us, we become more emotionally involved in the story and what happens to these two people.  The shots near the end of the film (of places Jesse and Celine were the night before) are lovely and elegiac.  Have you ever driven or walked by a place where something significant once happened to you?  To anyone else, that place might seem like a drab alleyway or commonplace bench, but to you it holds a special memory.  These shots capture that feeling perfectly.This entire movie plays like a beautiful memory...wonderful.If you enjoyed 'Before Sunrise', I highly recommend 'The Clock', a 1945 film with Judy Garland and Robert Walker.  Walker is a soldier on leave who (literally) runs into Garland at New York's Penn Station, and they only have two days to get to know each other.  While different in tone from 'Before Sunrise', it is definitely of the same spirit.",Null,2,4,15 March 2000
