First Man," Ryan Gosling Becomes America's Reluctant Hero in First Man
","(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)'We need to fail. We need to fail down here so we don't fail up there.' - Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) to Manned Spaceflight Center director Bob Gilruth (CiarÃ¡n Hinds) and Astronaut Office chief Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler)Potential spoilers belowThe bio found at the bottom of each of my reviews here on the Impacting Culture blog begins with how I 'once aspired to become an astronaut'. I became passionate about the Space Race in the '60s and early '70s ever since that one fateful week in my sixth grade science class, when my teacher screened director Ron Howard's 1995 space docudrama Apollo 13. While I have since deviated from that career path, my interest in the Space Race remains strong and has even spilled into my current occupation as a cinephile and film critic. Movies like the aforementioned Apollo 13, Interstellar, The Right Stuff, and Gravity perfectly fuse sports genre-esque stakes and catharsis with technological might and ample amounts of existential reflection.As for dramatizing the historical race to Moon in particular, one should look no further than the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon. It was this work of media and Tony Goldwyn's aloof yet easygoing portrayal of astronaut Neil Armstrong - specifically in parts of episode 1 and all of episode 6 - that dwelled in my mind as I approached First Man. Scripted by Spotlight writer Josh Singer and serving as director Damien Chazelle's follow-up to his beloved 2016 musical La La Land, First Man seeks to deliver an intimate portrait of a job-focused hero whose name has gone down in history. The result is less an Apollo 13 or Right Stuff and more of an Interstellar-deeply-felt, yet frigid to the point of leaving one at a conflicted loss, both for the intriguing character motivations and for the astonishing technical crafts on display.First Man tracks the story of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling, holding close to his work in Blade Runner 2049) from his days as a retired Navy pilot turned X-15 test pilot in late 1961 to the quarantine period following his (spoiler alert) successful command of the watershed Apollo 11 mission in mid-1969. Such is an overwhelming amount to cover in 141 minutes and First Man is mostly successful with regards to following Armstrong, the astronaut and father. Singer, Chazelle, and Gosling elect to portray Armstrong from the start in light of one key traumatic moment - the death of his two-year-old daughter Karen from a brain tumor in early 1962. 'I think it would be unreasonable to assume that it wouldn't have some effect,' says Armstrong when the subject is brought up months later during his astronaut recruitment interview with Manned Spaceflight Center director Bob Gilruth (CiarÃ¡n Hinds) and Astronaut Office chief Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler).In all honesty, this story decision has left me feeling mixed. Perhaps that is due to how little I knew of this early tragedy in Armstrong's time as a husband and father. This tragedy, furthermore, played no factor in Tony Goldwyn's turn in From the Earth to the Moon, so I began asking myself whether either of these works handled this element appropriately. In First Man's case, Karen's sickness and eventual death gets an all-too-brisk treatment that, arguably to a contrived degree, hangs over not just Neil's next eight years, but those of his dutiful and resilient wife Janet (Claire Foy).Yes, the loss of such a young child and of any child bears a heavy weight on every parent. Cinematic works from Don't Look Now, In America, Rabbit Hole, and even the aforementioned Gravity and Interstellar testify to that struggle. First Man argues that Karen's death pushed Neil Armstrong to close himself off to everyone and everything except the mission at hand. Accordingly, the celestial wonder, assisted by Paul Lambert's crisp visual effects and Justin Hurwitz's delicate and heart-pumping score, gets isolated to just the breathtaking Gemini 8 and Apollo 11 sequences. (Both match, if not slightly surpass due to the score and updated visual effects, their dramatizations in From the Earth to the Moon.)The astronaut camaraderie, and thus the overall human element, gets dampened as well. Promoting the balance between a sturdy family life and an astronaut career has good intentions. Yet all I have concluded from learning about this era is that this job turned most of its then-mostly men into terrible fathers, just as much - if not more - as any military service. Some die (Patrick Fugit as Elliot See and Jason Clarke as Ed White, for example), while the majority of others end up becoming distant to their loved ones to the point of divorce. (Unmentioned by the film, Neil and Janet's marriage would sadly end in divorce in 1994.) First Man plays up the psychological weight of Karen's death to a point beyond a grounding recommendation, despite Armstrong's cool attitude during training and missions that is largely absent in this biographical drama. Equally flight ground-worthy is Corey Stoll's take on Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin as an irritating know-it-all. Such an attitude was only hinted at and far overshadowed by the aspiration to become the 'first man' in Bryan Cranston's more reasonable portrayal in From the Earth to the Moon. Perhaps these, along with the paltry time spent with Apollo 11 Command Module Pilot Mike Collins (Lukas Haas), only emphasize for some the ease of working with the mission-focused Neil Armstrong.First Man is not as relentless and lasting as Whiplash or La La Land. As expected for his debut of directing another writer's screenplay, Chazelle's touch gives off that slight detachment of a director-for-hire. Still, First Man is far from the misfire Chazelle ought to watch out for at this stage in his career. Chazelle, Singer, Gosling, and co., much like Neil Armstrong, intend on continuing the success of their careers. First Man is merely one of the many small steps they have taken and will continue to take in their lifelong and individual endeavors.(Parental Note: First Man has been rated PG-13 by the MPAA 'for some thematic content involving peril, and brief strong language'. It has also been rated 12A by the BBFC for 'infrequent strong language' and 'moderate threat', and rated A-III (Adults) by the Catholic News Service for containing 'brief scatological material, a few profanities and milder oaths, as well as a single rough and a handful of crude terms.')R.N.B.",8,0,1,27 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Gaga & Cooper Bring the Grit & the Pipes in A Star Is Born
","(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)'Hey.' 'What?' 'I just wanted to take another look at you.' - Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) and Ally (Lady Gaga)Potential spoilers belowA Star Is Born - the story of a crossroads romance between a fading and alcoholic male star and a woman whose stardom lies just around the corner. For Hollywood, these four words link the years 1937, 1954, and 1976. (Some would even include 1932 and 2011.) Now, thanks to Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper (also writing, producing, and making his directorial debut), 2018 joins that list with vulnerable and raw energy.The life of grizzled country rock star Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) has begun to unravel. Despite the care of his much older brother and manager Bobby (Sam Elliot), Jackson's tinnitus is now affecting his playing ability, further hampered by severe alcoholism. Thirsty after yet another sold-out concert, Jackson stumbles into a drag bar. There, he discovers Ally (Lady Gaga), a struggling daytime waitress who moonlights as a bar singer, and becomes enraptured by her voice. Jackson soon convinces Ally to join him on tour to sing as well as contribute her own songs. As their romantic and artistic partnership blossoms, others rush to thrust Ally into stardom.For Ally, fame and fortune might have to cost her the love of her life and the toxic habits he cannot overcome.One trend I have noticed in each proper A Star Is Born version is how the actress, despite playing the rising starlet, edges out her male co-star in terms of fame. Fredric March's credits extend to three years before Janet Gaynor's start and he had already won a Best Actor Oscar (and would go on to win a second); Gaynor had won her Best Actress award at the 1st Oscars, had reigned as a box office queen, and would effectively retire from acting soon after the 1937 iteration returned her to the top. James Mason was more popular in his native Great Britain and his role in the 1954 musical numbered among his early substantial Hollywood parts; Judy Garland was seeking to bounce back from the end of her lucrative tenure at MGM that included The Wizard of Oz, Meet Me in St. Louis, and Easter Parade. Lastly, even the biggest Kris Kristofferson fan could not deny the mega-stardom of Barbra Streisand at the time of the 1976 rock musical's release.Lady Gaga and Bradley have seen steady success in pop music and film acting, respectively, yet Gaga's medium has given her the higher profile. Thus, the two maintain the Star Is Born co-star trend of a more famous actress and a somewhat less famous actor. However, Gaga has since grown from the aggressive and radio-friendly The Fame, The Fame Monster, and Born This Way to the more polarizing and less radio-friendly Artpop, Joanne, and Cheek to Cheek, her throwback collaboration with Tony Bennett.To counterbalance the diminishing top five hits as the 2010s continued, Gaga has ventured more into acting, including appearances in FX's American Horror Story (seasons 5 and 6). Gaga's artistic maturity, along with a slight focus on her unglamorous facial features, contribute to the naked and rebirth-like luminescence of her performance in A Star Is Born. Even as she evolves (or regresses) into someone similar to her real-life self from 2009, you believe and become inspired by Gaga as she takes the rough first steps to musical stardom, especially during the numbers 'Shallow' and 'Always Remember Us This Way'.The summer of 2009 that, if not ruled by the sounds of the Black Eyed Peas, was ruled by Lady Gaga, saw the release of The Hangover. The Golden Globe-winning comedy, which arguably defined 2009 along with box office behemoth Avatar, propelled Cooper and his several of his co-stars to heights of fame yet unattained. (Cooper and Hangover producer-director Todd Phillips reunite here as two of A Star Is Born's producers.) Cooper soon followed two disappointing Hangover sequels with appearances in Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle, and American Sniper (also as producer), earning him four Oscar nominations in three consecutive years.2015 through 2017 were comparatively quiet for Cooper, though one can attribute that to his four-fold duties for A Star Is Born. Cooper labors to achieve Jackson Maine's rugged and tragic drunkenness without making it appear overwrought, though emphasizing the unpreventable tinnitus would have curbed the melodramatic touches of depicting alcoholism. Cooper diverts such potentially distracting passion into the kinetic direction of the musical performance scenes. The crosscutting between Jackson and his band playing 'Out of Time' and 'Alibi' and Ally and her friend Ramon (an underused Anthony Ramos) quitting their restaurant jobs and flying out to Jackson's gig is a standout segment. Outside these and the central relationship, I would not rush to nominate Cooper in Best Director over other 2018 efforts, including Christopher McQuarrie for Mission: Impossible - Fallout, but A Star Is Born serves as a fantastic directorial debut nevertheless.In all likelihood, the populist factor of 2018's A Star Is Born might guarantee the movie a spot in the next Best Picture category. It continues the focus on musicians rather than actors that started with the 1976 rock musical, yet it scales back the excesses of post-Paramount Decision Old Hollywood in 1954 and of New Hollywood in 1976. The result is a grounded and updated reflection on the tug of war between fame, fortune, romance, and addiction. The story, though a fixture of Hollywood's long-held resistance to originality, always manages to reach a new generation.Who knows? Perhaps sometime in the next two decades, I too will sit before the silver screen to review once again the latest version of A Star Is Born.(Parental Note: A Star Is Born has been rated R by the MPAA 'for language throughout, some sexuality/nudity, and substance abuse'. It has also been rated 15 by the BBFC for 'strong language' and 'drug misuse', and rated A-III (Adults) by the Catholic News Service for containing 'a suicide, implied premarital sexual activity, fleeting upper female nudity, occasional drug use, a couple of profanities, and frequent rough language.')R.N.B.",8,4,7,19 October 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Undercover Shenanigans to Combat Racism in BlacKkKlansman
","'With the right white man, we can do anything.' - Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) to Chief Bridges (Robert John Burke)Potential spoilers belowThe piano and wails of the late musician Prince in his 1983 cover of 'Mary Don't You Weep' play over the credits to BlacKkKlansman, the latest film or 'joint' by filmmaker Spike Lee. As with the late musician, Lee's career consists of a handful of underrated gems and many disappointing struggles to reattain the heights of his bona-fide masterpieces-1989's Do the Right Thing and 1992's Malcolm X. BlacKkKlansman, Lee's biographical drama about a most fascinating episode in the life of police officer Ron Stallworth, is a confident return to form for the 61-year-old stalwart of politically and racially charged cinema.It is 1972. Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) joins the Colorado Springs Police Department as its first African-American detective. Feeling confident, Stallworth dares to infiltrate and expose the extremist and racist Ku Klux Klan (KKK) for conspiring to attack minorities. Stallworth teams up with his Jewish co-worker, Philip 'Flip' Zimmerman (Adam Driver), to go undercover in the 'Organization' (as Klan members refer to their group). Since the rookie detective made the mistake of using his own name, Zimmerman must also act and talk as Stallworth-a challenge, considering their racial backgrounds. Between cozying up to the Klan's 'Grand Wizard'/national director David Duke (Topher Grace) and his intent to sanitize its violent rhetoric to appeal to the mainstream and confronting their own cultural identities in the fight to eradicate hate, Stallworth and Zimmerman embark on the undercover investigation of their lives.Despite the heavy weight and sensitivity of its subject matter, BlacKkKlansman's greatest asset is the noticeable joy that exudes from each frame and all the actors inhabiting them. Leading the way is former professional football player turned actor John David Washington, son of famed actor Denzel Washington. Washington interacts with many of his fellow cast members, transitioning between 'King's' English and jive as the movie's embodiment the internal of tug o' war experienced by every American citizen of color, especially those of African descent. Though co-star Adam Driver's role is less flashy, he conveys just as well how Zimmerman's unpracticed Jewish heritage compels him to commit to investigating the KKK, which hates Jews about as much as those of African descent.Beyond the leading duo are supporting players who vary between functional and noteworthy. Corey Hawkins gets an extended rousing speech and a brief police pullover scene as the Trinidadian Civil Rights and Pan-African activist Kwame Ture. Topher Grace gets just enough screentime as the affable David Duke, whose passion for the KKK's dark agenda matches his lack of awareness when having one-to-one phone conversations with Ron Stallworth. On the other hand, Laura Harrier (who last appeared in Spider-Man: Homecoming) could have used more scenes as Patrice Dumas, president of the local Black Student Union. Her forever-low view of the police as an institution does little to cover her standard role as Stallworth's love interest.Surprisingly, two of BlacKkKlansman's secret weapons are cast members of European descent: Finish actor Jasper Pääkkönen gets to overuse his 'Jew radar' as testy 'Organization' member Felix Kendrickson. Kendrickson's interrogation of the undercover Zimmerman and whether he has been 'circumstanced' registers as one of biographical drama's funniest scenes. Ashlie Atkinson plays Kendrickson's faithful wife Connie as an outsider adorably itching to participate in her husband's KKK activities. Both actors relish their characters' racism the most from among the cast. One can imagine Lee, Pääkkönen, and Atkinson having many laughs while discussing this acting choice between takes.2018 has proved itself as a monumental year for films centered on those of African descent. I rank BlacKkKlansman just above Disney-Marvel's Black Panther (already the subgenre's representative for 2018), yet I ultimately prefer the innovative bonkers of Sorry to Bother You and the grounded conciseness of Blindspotting. Still, I hope BlacKkKlansman marks the official start of a bountiful autumn season in Spike Lee's storied filmmaking career.Now, onward to the dance floor! 'It's too late / to turn back now / I believe, I believe, I believe I'm fallin' in love...'(Parental Note: BlacKkKlansman has been rated R by the MPAA 'for language throughout, including racial epithets, and for disturbing/violent material and some sexual references'. It has also been rated 15 by the BBFC for 'racist violence and language,' and 'very strong language'.)R.N.B.",8,5,9,21 August 2018
Get Out," The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste
","(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)As the United States and the world coasts from the aftermath of a most controversial presidential election, many wonder whether the problem of racism has improved between the time that Barack Obama took the reins as the 44th president and this past January when he made way for Donald Trump. This eye-opening horror-comedy-from the moody, more reserved half of the popular Key & Peele comedy duo in his directorial debut, of all people-seems to suggest that the problem has only gotten worse. Luckily, such turnouts soon become fertile ground for curious and rich trends in art, which is a blessing for the barren horror cinema of modern times.A tense cold opening should squash any doubts of Mr. Peele's directorial hand, which captures (in mostly one long take) a young man (Keith Stanfield) walking down the quiet, moonlit streets of a seemingly safe neighborhood, joking on the phone about how easy it is to get lost in copy-and-paste suburban streets. Out of nowhere, a car blasting polka music sneaks ever closer to the man, and from there, we know the scene's destination. Nevertheless, the opening scene establishes the tone-even in the surrounding horrorshow, a contrasting amusement ensues.'Do they know?,' Chris Washington (Sicario's Daniel Kaluuya) asks his kindhearted, live-in girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams, of HBO's Girls), signifying that her affluent parents may not be aware of their interracial, 'he black, she white' romance. The film wastes no time bringing the couple to the wealthy home of Rose's parents-her neurosurgeon dad, Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford), and her psychotherapist mom, Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener). A dog-and-cat complementary attitude characterizes the two: A smiling Dean confidently but forcefully tries buddying it up with Chris with phrases like 'My man' and remarking that he 'would've voted Obama for a third term,' whereas the subdued Missy all but sneakily coaxes Chris to reveal his childhood traumas in one of her hypnosis sessions. Right away, Chris senses something rather askew about the estate-the two servants Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel) are both African-American, not to mention behaving like characters out of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Furthermore, Dean reveals to Chris during the tour of the grounds that his father would have competed in the U.S. track and field team for the 1936 Summer Olympics if not for a certain runner named Jesse Owens. Just an innocent little family tidbit, right? The creepiness only amps up from there with the arrival of the family's younger son Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), who's obsessed with Chris' physicality, and the Chris-fixated behavior of the guests at the neighborhood get-together the following day, where Chris recognizes the young man from the opening, the one we watched get kidnapped-something Chris' TSA-employed best friend back in the city (Lil Rel Howery) is quick to point out to him over cell phone.With this solo debut behind the camera, writer-director Jordan Peele never forgot that only the handling of setup and payoff differentiate between comedy and horror. Peele brought out worthwhile performances from all of his actors. Whitford and Keener handle their characters like seasoned pros, harnessing their warm demeanors to cover sinister intentions. Star Daniel Kaluuya proves his worth as a dependable lead, while it's always a delight to see character actor Stephen Root at work, even in a small role. The standout performance of the bunch, however, is Lil Rel Howery as Rod, who gets his own subplot as the Chris' determined best friend whose only obstacle when warning the police of Chris' potentially dangerous circumstances is his graceless street language. Howery's turn provides the comic relief in an otherwise disturbing tale.Only mature teens and older should watch this film. Characters, particularly Rod, don't shy away from strong language when the circumstances welcome it. Though somewhat justified by one character's intentions, the story portrays Chris and Rose's cohabitating relationship as normal. Viewers should expect sudden, bloody violence towards the end, with the more grotesque moments involving medical tools. Moreover, the conservative crowd might find some of the more politically-charged elements questionable, such as when the party guests all show a bit of red while Chris is primarily dressed in blue or when a character eats colorful cereal while keeping the white milk in a separate glass. Horror is all about fear of the unfamiliar and few in American history know that better than the African-American community. One may laugh and fawn over a foreign, seemingly innocent creature, up until the moment it bites off a finger or burrows into a brain. Get Out is a film that thrives in that gray area in between-that final moment of suspense between the smile and the scream.",8,1,4,18 August 2018
Logan," Mutant Sendoffs in Logan
","(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)Many have credited 2000's X-Men for spearheading the second generation of comic book cinema that has largely taken over the entertainment industry today. Moviegoers acquainted themselves with other comic book properties arriving on the big screen while also making successful the eight succeeding X-Men installments. Then, when stars Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart declared that this year's Logan (inspired by the 2008 graphic novel Old Man Logan) would be the last time they each would portray the popular Marvel X-Men mutants Wolverine and Charles Xavier respectively, the hype for the film increased ten-fold - something 20th Century Fox likely appreciated, since 2016's Deadpool hogged all the success and X-Men: Apocalypse fell short of expectations. The result? Well, when the film begins with an F-word, ends with a somewhat sacrilegious final shot, and comes short in building up to a satisfying farewell for two popular actors playing two popular fictional characters, I am left wondering whether it was the Jackman-Stewart mutant swan song writer-director James Mangold and company had hoped to deliver.The year is 2029 and the lack of new mutants born in the past 25 years have made mutants endangered. James 'Logan' Howlett (Hugh Jackman, in his ninth and last appearance as the character), formerly known as Wolverine, goes about minding his quiet job as a limousine chauffeur around the southern U.S. border. Logan lives with tracking mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant) in a decrepit smelting plant just past the border in Mexico. There, he and Caliban care for a senile Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart, also playing the character one last time), formerly known as Professor X, whose mental instability leads to seizures that wreak devastation - a scenario Logan helps prevent by hustling for prescription drugs.One day, Logan happens upon Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a nurse from a powerful biotechnological corporation, who begs Logan to chaperone an eleven-year-old girl named Laura (newcomer Dafne Keen). Laura, known as 'X-23', was one of a group of mutant children bred by the corporation as weapons, then deemed disposable once X-24 became the successful clone. Gabriela took Laura and helped free the other children before the corporation could terminate them. Now she begs Logan - who is actually Laura's biological father - to see that Laura makes it to 'Eden', a mutant sanctuary in North Dakota, without falling into the clutches of Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), the corporation's enhanced security chief, who tried coaxing Logan into bringing him Laura. When Gabriela is suddenly found dead, Logan hastily takes Charles and Laura with him, fighting their way through Pierce's widespread detail and embarking on a long road trip north, while Pierce and his crew force the unlucky Caliban to track them. From there, it becomes a matter of whether Logan, Charles, and Laura can race to safety in time and with their lives, if that safety for mutants even exists at all.Logan is a formidable superhero drama, easily one of the best of the X-Men franchise and even the superhero subgenre in general. Jackman and Stewart have spent the past seventeen years perfecting their iterations of the iconic Marvel mutants. Many have identified their faces with the characters to the extent that many wonder if any other actor could replace them. That Logan showcases both Jackman and Stewart's final appearances as their respective mutants makes it worthwhile. Also worthwhile is Dafne Keen in her feature-film debut as Laura/X-23. Ms. Keen demonstrates a strong physical and facial commitment, despite acting mute for much of the runtime, to her budding mutant character who can barely resist lashing out like a diminutive killing machine.
However, much of my appreciation for writer-director James Mangold's finished product starts to recede from there. Hugh Jackman reportedly took a cut in pay to ensure the film's R-rating, and while the generous addition of blood certainly matches up to that rating, the laced profanity throughout feels unnatural and forced at times. Meanwhile, the villains are rather unengaging and forgettable, from the leaders (Boyd Holbrook and later Richard E. Grant as Dr. Zander Rice of the same biotechnological corporation) coming off as typical villain stereotypes to their underlings functioning as mere bullet-and-blade targets for both Logan and the surprisingly vicious Laura.The weakness of the villains hints at what really keeps Logan from being 'the next Dark Knight,' as many fans and even professional critics have already declared. Jackman and Stewart's franchise swan-song performances are commendable, but they do not reach the heights of Heath Ledger's Joker back in 2008. A key disconnect lies between the inner, age-related regrets of Logan and Charles and all the typical X-Men chaos taking place outside of those regrets. The villains have little regard for such turmoil; they just want the mutants caged and studied, like in most other X-Men franchise installments. A bolder narrative would have both heroes and villains reflecting on approaching possibly the post-mutant era of humanity. Instead, this story amounts to a bleak road trip in which our heroes escort a special passenger to a safe place and protect that passenger from the formidable, organized antagonists, with gratuitous amounts of blood and severed limbs incorporated to satisfy its R-rating. In a sense, then, I cannot help but feel disappointed in the overall product. Last year's X-Men Apocalypse failed to excite overall, but at least there the fun, the engaging, and the clumsy never mingled and fused together into a bland stew. Logan banked on the emotional sendoff for its lead actors and while it mostly succeeds in that regard, most other elements seemed to run parallel with that intention, thus coming off as solid but unspectacular action storytelling. Yes, the action sequences have a worthwhile, if immensely bloody and profane (and certainly not family friendly), punch to them, but for the overall product as a teary-eyed farewell, Logan should have been more. Instead of drying my eyes as I waved goodbye, I found myself shrugging and remarking, 'Well, it was fun while it lasted,' before rejoining 2017 in cinema as it inched forward, anticipating that annual push of the summer blockbuster season.R.N.B.",7,0,0,24 August 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Ever Just the Same, Barely a Surprise in Beauty & the Beast
","Reviewing films like this remake of Disney's 1991 animated classic tends to frustrate me as a film critic who desires for films to stand as apart as possible while also cementing a unique footprint within all of cinema. That's a tough outlook, especially since the success of 2010's Alice in Wonderland and later releases Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book has led Disney's live-action side to settle into a financial comfort zone of remaking classic films while setting artistic risk aside. I find it almost impossible to appraise these remakes without comparing them to their earlier (and demonstrably superior) animated iterations. Such is the case with director Bill Condon's live-action Beauty & the Beast, whose original 1991 animated film became the first ever animated nominee for the Academy Award for Best Picture - already an insurmountable bar for this live-action remake.As with the 1991 animated version, the opening voice-over recounts a spoiled and selfish French prince (Dan Stevens) and the servants of his decadent castle who fall victim to the curse of an enchantress seeking shelter with only a rose as her payment. She turns the prince into a hideous beast, his servants into various household objects, and sets the fall of her rose's last petal as the deadline for the Beast to love and be loved in return or otherwise be cursed forever.Years later, an inventor from the nearby village of Villeneuve named Maurice (Kevin Kline) gets lost and chased by wolves in the surrounding forest, before finding shelter in the castle. He then enrages the Beast when trying to pluck a rose from the garden for his headstrong and bookish daughter, Belle (Emma Watson). Belle desires a life beyond the boundaries of Villeneuve and away from the shallow affections of Gaston (Luke Evans), the village's narcissistic hunter. Belle manages to find her father and offers to replace him as the Beast's prisoner. The Beast warns her that she will live with him in the castle forever, which she accepts.Belle initially views the cursed prince as nothing more than the beast that he is, while the Beast finds her too stubborn to respect. Yet, with the help of his servants - the charismatic Lumiere (Ewan McGregor), the strict Cogsworth (Ian McKellen), and the considerate Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) among them - she starts to warm to the Beast's cold-hearted exterior. Still, it's only a matter of time until either the drop of the last petal or for the persistent Gaston to threaten to have Maurice committed to the asylum if Belle refuses to marry him.To start, this live-action remake clocks in at 129 minutes - about a half-hour longer than the animated film. Many over the years have noted the plot holes of the Disney adaptation such as the enchantress cursing the prince as a ten-year-old, the villagers' poor memory on the fate of the nearby castle, and the time Belle actually spends in the castle growing close to the Beast versus the struggle between her father and Gaston with the rest of the villagers. The animated film's shorter runtime and effortless pacing lacks the room for audiences to fully ponder over such story flaws during the viewing, but with the extra half-hour, the remake gives me that space to wonder about those plot holes.Concerns about the narrative mistakes aren't remedied by most of the film and its retread of 1991, which tends to coast from song to song at the cost of the drama in between the music. From the lively 'Belle', the glorious 'Gaston', the uproarious 'Be Our Guest', and the moving and magical title song, the existing (and heavily nostalgic) Alan Menken-composed and Howard Ashman-penned soundtrack remains fun to sing. Yet the songs still don't match the punch of 1991, especially with newly added instrumental breaks that pause the song (and the film) for the visual effects crew to momentarily grab the spotlight.Of the actors, Luke Evans visibly commits to his portrayal of Gaston, despite lacking 1991's obvious brawn and the deep singing voice. Emma Watson as Belle takes some time to fully grow into her character (about the time when she makes a small squeal at the sight of the Beast's library), and even then she doesn't make the caring and brave character all her own, especially with her merely solid pipes. Dan Stevens' performance of the original song 'Evermore' (lyrics by Tim Rice) serves as the rightful peak of his adequate screen time as the Beast. The household objects always feel physically present, even though Ewan McGregor (Lumiere) is no Jerry Orbach and Emma Thompson (Mrs. Potts) is no Angela Lansbury.And then there's Josh Gad as LeFou.I largely ignored, as with most news about the revelations of a character before a film's release, the Bill Condon's interviews that revealed that Josh Gad's LeFou will display same-sex attraction in the film. Upon seeing the film, I knew the performance certainly didn't meet the bar set by the controversy while providing some material for discussion. Jesse Corti's 1991 voice performance as LeFou perfectly captured the sidekick's loyal but pushover personality; however, Josh Gad as LeFou spends much of his screen time flashing piercing and longing looks at his friend of many years. Among several specific moments, LeFou remarks, 'It ain't gonna happen,' to the various Gaston-fixated village women, and when Gaston wonders why his friend hasn't met a woman yet, LeFou replies that others find his 'clingy' attitude as an obstacle. Gaston never reciprocates such affections, which does limit what LeFou can express in the film, but any knowledge of director Bill Condon's interviews will frame LeFou's screen time in a needlessly sexualized context and will overshadow this film for some time.Past Disney remakes saw me leaving the theater with, at most, a feeling of vague satisfaction towards a lavish, but cinematically bland exercise - similar to repackaging over-performed greatest hits as new singles - but this controversy cements my overall underwhelming impression of this remake. I rank the 1991 film among the top five of the Walt Disney Animation Studios canon, so translating it to live action does little to stain my enjoyment of the material and my resulting star rating. Yet as I consider Beauty & the Beast's week-old cultural presence and study Disney's upcoming queue of live-action remakes, there exists in me a longing for the studio to instead use its resources for something bolder, riskier, newer - 'something there that wasn't there before.'R.N.B.",6,0,0,25 August 2018
Life," Life: A Monster House...in Space!
","(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)With the Alien franchise delivering a new installment in a few months and just a few years removed from the emotional and visual roller-coaster that was 2013's Gravity, I felt positive about this new ensemble sci-fi thriller directed by Swedish director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House, Child 44). It boasts an international ensemble cast, which includes Ryan Reynolds reuniting with his Deadpool screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, and forecast its arrival with memorable trailers - many centering on the moment where the cute little alien creature turns on the scientist studying it while his crewmates watch. Either a thrilling b-movie or a compact, ambitious, and intelligent sci-fi thriller could result from this venture. Having now experienced Life (the film, not my own), what irks me and will irk me for some time is that the film tries to be both and barely manages to be tolerable.Set in the present day, Life follows a six-member, multinational crew currently inhabiting the International Space Station, tasked with retrieving a returning capsule from Mars and examining the soil samples contained within while in Earth orbit. British biologist Dr. Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) manages to extract a dormant, single-celled organism from one of the samples and revive it, much to the delight of his crewmates. The organism matures in a short amount of time into a multi-celled, stimulus-sensitive organism that quarantine officer Dr. Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) notes is 'all muscle, all brain, and all eye.' The schoolchildren of America, monitoring the mission from the surface, decide to call the organism 'Calvin'. Several days later, when an atmospheric accident in the lab causes Calvin - now a palm-sized, fluorescent, flower-shaped creature - to become dormant once again, Dr. Derry suggests prodding Calvin with a mild electric shock. The rest of the crew - Russian Commander Katerina Golovkina (Olga Dihovnichaya), American medical officer Dr. David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), Japanese engineer Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), and cocky American pilot Rory 'Roy' Adams (Ryan Reynolds) watch from the opposite side of the glass as Dr. Derry inserts his hands into the protective gloves stretching into the quarantine cage and begins to re-animate Calvin with the electric shocks.What follows is every astronaut's nightmare - a slaughterhouse in space, where there's nowhere to escape, a lifeless void separates them from potential rescue, and much of the crew's time and mental power is spent early on trying to also keep the expensive house intact if possible.From the trailers, one can grasp a modern-day mashup of both Alien, the 1979 sci-fi horror film by director Ridley Scott, and Gravity, the 2013 space thriller from director Alfonso Cuarón, with the multinational crew from director Danny Boyle's 2007 film Sunshine tossed in as well (Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada appears in both Sunshine and this). The opening sequence in which the crew scrambles to secure the approaching Mars capsule that has sustained small asteroid hits during its transit certainly emulates the opening to Cuarón's film with its smooth long-take approach and well-choreographed blocking of actors. From there, the story coasts through the first month of their orbital mission, until Calvin's decisive electric shock treatment.About the time that the shock treatment leads Calvin to turn against the crew, I start to sense that director Espinosa has yet to fully deliver the dramatic thrills necessary for me to become invested in the ensemble's plight. The rest of the film, outside of the opening capsule retrieval sequence, offers close camerawork and editing that generates a fast pace, unlike the spacious environments and ominous, patient progression of Alien. This fast pace, furthermore, limits drastically the screentime for the proper fleshing out of the individual crew members, especially when one can tell who's most likely to survive the end of the film based on star power (or a promotional image, like the one above). Compare that to Gravity, which centers almost entirely on Sandra Bullock's character.The problem ultimately lies with the rudimentary treatment of the characters, many of whom I barely remember upon leaving theater aside from some basic details, the manners of dying, and who survives. Life attempts to bring together a patiently layered ensemble showcase with what's basically a one-woman show, not to mention a complex horror think-piece that hides the monster instead of showing it (like in this film) with a simple journey of getting from A to B that bolsters incredible technical craft. Even for a skillful director, it's almost impossible to marry the approaches to those two types of stories without compromising on character development.The instinctive reaction to fall back on older films suggests another central flaw of Life - it falls short in offering anything original and memorable. As a sci-fi thriller, it meets modest ambitions by evoking other cinematic sci-fi landmarks and little else, and audiences are mostly just along for the ride, rarely treated to a thorough build-up of tension, much less fear, when registering the characters' choices. It comes off as forced and unimpressive when the end of act two, deus ex machina moment of rest for the surviving crew members gravitates around a children's nighttime story and not a meditation on fate, purpose, and perhaps God's hand in their eventual demise. The sole displays of power in this film are the gruesome, bloody, traumatic deaths - the kind common in a tired slasher film, which alone says enough.What, then, is Life? Life reminds filmmakers and audiences that they'll need more than just the concept to create a truly horrifying work of cinematic sci-fi, even though the concept tends to deliver a competent work anyway. Competency, however, can only last so long and one can guess that director Daniel Espinosa and company would've preferred not only the commercial success (having amassed only half of its production budget in its opening weekend worldwide box office), but the lasting legacy that will most likely elude this film by 2017's end.R.N.B.",6,0,2,26 August 2018
