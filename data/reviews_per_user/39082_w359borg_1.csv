The Ring," Disappointing remake
","I'll say from the outset that I might very well be biased. I saw the Japanese masterpiece several times before finally seeing this and I was very disappointed. They've removed the ESP plot which explained a lot in the original and basically replaced it with horses. Ok, so horses can tell those who are cursed and go nuts around them? Sorry, this is a bad remake. Not necessarily pointless, it could have been done a lot better. That said, it could be because a lot of what made the original was Japanese folklore and superstition, and maybe the lack of familiarity and English language helped with the suspense added to the unsettling nature of it. The acting was good though so there's one thing.",5,0,2,14 April 2019
