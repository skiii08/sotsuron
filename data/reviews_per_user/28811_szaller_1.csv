The Ring," a huge disappointment
","As I haven't seen a decent horror movie for about a decade, after a short research on recent ones, I picked 'The Ring'. Also because of Naomi Watts whose performance in 'Mulholland Drive' was awesome (here she was nothing special). The script and the reviews suggested that it was a great freaky horror but to me it was simply boring. There wasn't a single scene that frightened me. The storyline was flat, there wasn't anything at all to make you think of or remember this movie, there was no message, no point. The characters were boring as well with an average acting, they didn't make you worry/care about them if they die. I blame the director for that. The only good things were some nice shots and and the sounds. The fake ending was so stupid, it's only purpose being to leave the story open for a 2nd part, which I won't see for sure. 3/10",3,1,2,14 January 2004
