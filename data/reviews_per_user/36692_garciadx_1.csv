E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Fantastic Re-Release
",I thought the re-release would be the same old boring movie that I had seen since I was a teenager but wow was I wrong seeing it on TV just didn't do it justice as on the big screen. The screen gave it its touch of magic back. I never got to see this movie in theaters on its first release. So now that I had the opportunity to see the movie I jumped at the chance. The re-mastered score was very well done. The new features put on E.T give it the look that was meant to be but could not be accomplished 20 years ago. I really enjoyed the movie all over again. I felt like it was the first time I had ever seen it. Great picture. Can't wait for the DVD!,10,1,2,27 March 2002
