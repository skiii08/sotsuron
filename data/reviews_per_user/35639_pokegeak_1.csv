Despicable Me 2," Despicable Me 2 is the funniest movie I seen in a while.
",Despicable Me 2 is the sequel to the first Despicable Me which I liked. In fact I liked it more than other people. I saw the movie in 3D and it's OK but not really worth your hard earned cash. My main problem was it was too clich√© and I knew what was going to happened in the film which was sad. But it's biggest star are the Minions they are hilarious. They saved this movie and they turned it into comedic gold. The movie was funnier than Monsters University by a mile. But my main problem is it is just a huge comedy there is barely any depth. Sure this is the biggest laughs I had in the cinema and I had a great time overall. This movie is worth your time and hard earned cash.,8,0,1,25 July 2013
