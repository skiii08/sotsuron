"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Shock a British Film I like
","I do not generally find most modern British comedies funny, neither do I find Simon Pegg funny or a good actor, I didn't like Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz so imagine my shock when I really liked this film AND found it very funny. From beginning to end there is plenty to make you chuckle even though the end is a bit corny. Thandie Newton is as gorgeous as ever and her American fiancé is just hilarious. I watched this while on holiday ( because it was free I guess ) but I am glad I saw it. So if you want a good laugh then get hold of this film, it will be well worth it I assure you. It is a shame that there are not more really good comedies set in England these days.",7,0,1,10 March 2009
The Equalizer," OK but not great
","Not a bad film by any means but it could have been so much better. It is hard to know where it failed as Denzel is his usual brilliant best and Chloë Grace Moretz was incredibly good.I also can't really blame the story line as it was pretty standard for this type of movie. But maybe that's the problem? It follows the usual Hollywood formula and other movies have done this sort of thing much better.I also though there was far too much profanity, I am not a prude but it was just over used by a few characters.I also thought that the end scene could have been better. I didn't find a lot of what Robert McCall did was overly clever and that is the whole point of the Equalizer.So overall I would say this is a watchable movie but not one I will be too keen to watch again.",5,1,1,14 June 2016
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," I never get it
","I watched this film after hearing others rave on about it being the best film ever and to say I was disappointed is an understatement. I foud it incredibly boring, the special effects were laughable and ET itself was about the worst glove puppet I had ever seen, a hand in a sock would have been more realistic. I am a big fan of Steven Spielburg and enjoy most of his films but this one just lost me. However I can respect the fact that many other people have really enjoyed this film and I am not really criticizing them at all, I am simply saying that it was lost on me. I just don't see it as a great or even a good film. 'Batteries not included' was to my mind a much better ET film but didn't seem to appeal to as many people as ET.",1,16,45,12 March 2009
John Wick," Better than average action movie
","Keanu Reeves is a very under rated action star as this movie clearly shows. OK he isn't the bet actor in the world and has a very limited range of emotion but for this movie he was perfect.The story is a good one and yes it has holes in the plot but you don't watch this kind of movie as if it is a work of art.Keanu sure can carry off the action and is very convincing. There are inconsistencies in his ability and it does stretch credibility that he can take severe beatings that then have no affect or even markings on him, but this is more of a cartoonish action movie than one you watch for realism. I did think it was overly violent in places and don't watch this is bad language offends you because there are places where it gets over used.Over all it is a good action movie that those who like this stuff will love.",7,0,0,22 June 2017
Gravity," Soooooooo Boring
","I am not even sure I should be reviewing this movie since I failed to watch it all the way through.But I couldn't carry on any longer as I would have found standing still in a desert less boring.How they could have made a movie with such excellent actors as George Clooney, Sandra Bullock and Ed Harris so dull is beyond me.I was actually really looking forward to it after all the Oscar hype about it, but if you have seen any trailers then you have probably seen the best parts of this movie.Even though the cinematography is good, that is about all that is good.One of the worst movies ever made.",1,2,8,27 July 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Such a let down
","What a dismal sequel, it seemed to have been made to cash in on the first and at the same time make way for a third. The term cash-cow comes to mind. This movie is just too long and uninteresting. Davey Jones and his crew are just a mess of special effects more distracting than entertaining. Compared to the first film, Dead Man's Chest was a big disappointment. I loved the first film and the special effects with the crew being dead made the SF believable but the Davey Jones character made the whole thing a joke. I have the 1st film on DVD, it is a very good film, but for me that is where it all ends. I did watch the third one to see if they had recaptured the magic of the first one but it was even more dire than the 2nd. Johnny Depp created one of cinemas great characters in Jack Sparrow and it is a shame that they didn't make sequels more along the lines of his humour with some good old swashbuckling thrown in.",1,4,6,12 March 2009
Argo," Great Movie
","I really enjoyed this movie, it had me on the edge of my seat more than once, especially at the end. OK I know it is not 100% accurate but I don't mind when a film grips me like this one did. The tension and anxiety of those involved can be felt through the screen which illustrates just how well acted and directed this film is. Ben Afleck is perfect for the part, although he is one of the few who looks nothing like the character he is playing, but Alan Arkin steals every scene he is in, he is just brilliant in this. After watching this film I had a great sense of 'thank goodness that wasn't me', it was terrifying to think that these people were actually in this situation. Sadly if the same happened today, I doubt leaving would have been as easy as it eventually was. The direction and cinematography were superb and really reflected the feel of 1970s and the political climate.",8,0,1,31 May 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Great film, shame about the sequels
","This is a great film, full of action, romance and humour. I loved it and couldn't wait for the sequels ( I lived to wish I had missed them ) Johnny Depp creates one of movies great characters in jack Sparrow who really steals this film. All the supporting actors are good, even the smaller parts and the film seems much shorter than its 2 and a half hours. This film was so good that the awful, over special effected sequels have ruined what could have been a great series of films. The sequels should have concentrated more on Jack Sparrow and his humour instead of ridiculous and unbelievable characters that appeared in them. ( Davey Jones to name just one stupid invention )",9,1,4,12 March 2009
12 Angry Men," One of the best fims of all time
","Everyone has already explained why this is such a good film. It is a travesty that it never got an Oscar bu that is a reflection more on the Oscars than the film itself. Henry Fonda is outstanding in this as is Lee J Cobb, but really all the actors were very well cast. Don't make the mistake of confusing this with the colour remake, although good it does not match up to this original and best version. For me the best bits are the part where Jack Klugman's character produces the knife ( although this could never have happened in a real Jury it is stil dramatic ) and then there is the part where Lee J Cobb breaks down while looking at a picture of his son. This film will take you on an emotional roller-coaster ride for sure.",10,2,4,9 March 2009
12 Angry Men," One of the best movies ever made
","This remains a favorite movie of mine and I never tire of it. It has dated a little and is over melodramatic at times, but over all it is an amazing example of first class movie making. 
Every actor plays their part well and even though I know the outcome I am still intrigued each time I watch it.
Great movie that should be in everyone top 100 list.",10,0,0,30 August 2018
Spotlight," Brilliant but disturbing
","Firstly the movie itself is so well made and acted, Mark Ruffalo,Mike Rezendes, Michael Keaton ,Rachel McAdams and Liev Schreiber are all excellent in their respective roles.
The subject is disturbing, but not surprising, the history of the Catholic church is littered with this sort of thing. I recommend the book 'Vicars of Christ' by Peter De Rossa, that shows just how immoral and corrupt the Church sand Popes have been and it seems still are.
Why anyone still attends these Churches baffles me. There may be a few Priests who try to do what's right, but the structure and higher ups are clearly evil.",10,0,0,24 July 2019
The Way Back," Very well made
","This is one of those movies I watched and then wondered why more fuss wasn't made of it when it was released.
Brilliantly made with an excellent cast. Everyone was good in this.
I have since read that there is some doubt about how true it is, but it is still a great movie.",10,1,1,21 October 2019
The Book Thief," Just a wonderfully made film
","This film is brilliant on so many levels. All the actors give brilliant performances, including the children. The story is riveting and you can relate to the characters even though few of us would have had their experiences. Having read the book it is amazing how well the director and scriptwriters do to reflect exactly how I imagined each character.Of special note is the young actress Sophie Nélisse who plays Liesel Meminger, she is one to watch for the future I am sure.The underlying morals that come through this film are also really well revealed.I would rate this as one of the best films I have ever seen. Just wonderful!",10,0,5,21 July 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Utter Nonsense
",Sory but I turned it off after 30 mins and that was more than I could really stand. A musical Sweeny Todd? What a load of old tosh. Nonsense. Awful Songs. Badly made. Rubbish idea. Waste of money. Don't watch it. I had to find ten lines and as you can tell that wasn't easy. Sory but I turned it off after 30 mins and that was more than I could really stand. A musical Sweeny Todd?

Lost in Translation," Utter tripe
","Oh come on all you lot raving on about this film. It is by far the worst film I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. Basically nothing really ever happens and you are left at the end wondering when it is going to begin. Bill Murray is NOT a good actor and he is NOT funny. The only good thing in the film is Scarlet Johannsen and that is just her beauty. The characters in this film are wooden and the story is virtually non existent. I firmly believe that some people are seeing things in this film are are just not there, in fact their reaction to this film reminds me of the way some react to so called Modern Art, they are just too afraid to say that it is rubbish. They seem to believe that it makes them more intelligent to act as if there is some hidden meaning. This film is incredibly dull and has no redeeming features whatsoever.",1,2,4,12 March 2009
American Hustle," A Total Mess - Over-hyped rubbish
","After all the hype I wanted to like this movie but was left thinking, 'what was that all about?' The story line, if you can call it that, was a mess. The title indicates some clever hustle, but there was none. The script was all over the place and the over use of the F word is lazy writing in my opinion.I didn't sympathise or care for any of the characters and although the acting was good, they couldn't save the movie from it's dire script and sloppy direction.Fortunately I bought the DVD in a pound shop, but had I paid more I would have demanded a refund as it was so bad.",1,2,5,22 April 2017
The Bourne Ultimatum," Yet another Brilliant Bourne Movie
","Well they just get better and better. Third in a series is usually an awful made just for money movie, but this is one of the best Bourne films (so Far anyway).Matt Damon really is a brilliant Bourne, tough, ruthless but with mixed emotions as he still struggles to remember who or what he is.Joan Allen and Julia Styles are both excellent in this as they were in the last Movie. David Strathairn is just perfectly cast as Noah Vosen as is Albert Finney as Dr. Albert Hirsch.The action sequences are as good as in the previous two movies and the pace of the action is just right.I just hope they make another sometime soon to replace that awful Bourne Legacy which just didn't work at all.The end of this brilliant movie left the option to bring back Matt Damon as Bourne!",10,2,3,30 June 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great Biopic
","Very well made movie despite some glaring inaccuracies. Rami Malek deserved his Oscar playing Freddie Mercury. I was pleased the movie concentrated more on the band and Freddie's musical performing rather then his private life, although enough of that was presented to show what a tormented soul he was.
The recreation of the 'Live Aid' gig was amazing.",9,0,1,16 April 2019
The Bourne Identity," Excellent Depiction of Jason Bourne
","There have been previous attempts to bring Bourne to the screen, most notably the awful made for TV movie with Richard Chamberlin and Jaclyn Smith.But this movie is one of my favourites that I can watch over and over again.Mat Damon really carries this off and captures Robert Ludlums Jason Bourne. OK in the book he is slightly older but apart from that this movie is how I imagined things from reading the book.There are things omitted, probably to keep the movie from going on too long, but it moves at a good pace and keeps you interested throughout.All supporting actors are good, Franka Potente is very good and holds her own as Marie, Brian Cox is excellent as always and interesting to see both Clive Owen and Julia Stiles in relatively minor roles but carrying their parts off really well.The director Doug Liman must surely get credit for bringing to the screen this complex and interesting character.",10,1,2,13 June 2016
Justice League," I fell asleep
","I fell asleep trying to watch this. CGI alone does not make sa good movie.
Story line weak and poorly executed. These are great characters but they need a better script and director.",2,2,15,14 March 2019
The Revenant," Amazed at the Bear scene but little else
","I was disappointed in this film as it received so much praise and won Oscars, I should have known really as most often critics choices are miles away from what us ordinary folk think. The scene with the Grizzly bear was incredible and I found myself wondering how on earth they did it (I have since found out how). No doubt about Leonardo's performance as he was superb but the film over all was dull and often defied reality. No one would have survived time in freezing waters and then coming back up on icy sub zero temperature land.This film was based on a real person who did survive an attack by a Grizzly but the way he was attacked in this film, he would have been left with a broken spine and paralysed for sure. I also found a lot of the violence unnecessarily graphic and there is no way that people in the 1800s used modern day profanity, but it seems that many film makers today want to re-write how history was for some bizarre reason.So over all a disappointment.",3,6,10,31 May 2016
Divergent," Much better than the Hunger games
","This is a good movie series that worked well. Good acting and an engaging story.
Much better than the Hunger games in my opinion.",8,1,2,22 January 2019
Dreamgirls," Watchable but!
","The movie begins as a parody of early Motown, Jamie Foxx is clearly supposed to be Berry Gordy, Keith Robinson is Smokey Robinson and obviously the Dreamgirls are the Supremes, Eddie Murphy's character is an amalgamation of several male singers, aspects of Jackie Wilson, Marvin Gaye and David Ruffin are all in his character.
The first half of the movie is quite good with some great Motown-like music, but then it switches to dull over long show tunes which does not fit into the story.
The Effie White character played by Jennifer Hudson is clearly following Florence Ballard, who was the better singer in the Supremes but not the kind of voice Berry Gordy needed to appeal to white audiences. Beyonce carries off a passable impression of Diana Ross and there are other Motown acts parodied such as The Jackson 5.
I think with all the talent this movie would have been better as a Motown biopic instead of a parody.",5,0,0,30 May 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man," Why?
","Why was this made? Let me guess .. to make money? It sure wasn't made for any other reason as everything about it is bad. Spider-man is so un spider-man like it is ridiculous. The plot is weak, the story is not true to the original and it all seems rushed towards a bad remake or Godzilla. The acting is really bad, so much so that I don't know where to begin. In fact this was one of those films I just wanted to end. I almost walked out of the cinema but kept hoping things would improve. They didn't! You know this review wants you to add so many words but I am struggling to find anything else to say about it! Here is my tenth line then. It is rubbish! Don't watch it!",1,1,14,1 July 2013
Now You See Me," Not bad at all
",I enjoyed this film for a number of reasons. It was well acted by everyone and had an interesting plot. I loved the magic and it seamed the actors had gone to a lot of trouble to appear convincing in each of their roles. But the main reason I enjoyed it was the end. I genuinely never saw it coming! Great twist! My only criticism is that it could have been even better. The idea of Magicians using their skills to commit crimes could have had more mileage and maybe an even more ingenious ply along the lines of Mission Impossible ( the TV series not those awful TGom Cruise films )However I enjoyed the film and would even watch it again.,7,1,1,27 December 2014
Non-Stop," An OK film
","Not too bad a film, although I couldn't help shouting at the screen quite a few times. Things like, 'really?' or 'why on earth would you do that?'Liam seems to either do brilliant films or rubbish. 'Taken' is a brilliant film, but 'Taken2' is rubbish. 'Unknown' was a great film but 'The Grey' was just awful. However this film falls into the OK category. To many plot holes for my liking, but having said that I never guessed who the terrorists actually were.What is sad is that this was a good story and it could have been so much better. I echo many of the criticisms and plot holes that others have already put on here.",5,0,1,21 July 2014
The Transporter," One to watch over and over again!
","I can honestly watch this film over and over again.Jason Statham makes his first appearance as Ex-Special Forces operator Frank Martin who lives a quiet life in the French Mediterranean, but hires himself out as a 'transporter' who moves goods from one place to another. No questions asked. Frank adheres to a strict set of rules, which he never breaks. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know who he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. However Frank's newest delivery makes him break some of his rules.He's been hired by an American known only as 'Wall Street' to make a delivery; but when Frank stops along the route, he notices his package is moving. Violating Rule Three, Frank looks inside the bag, finding its contents to be a beautiful, gagged woman played by Qi Shu. Frank realises what evil man Wall Street is and he sets about destroying a human trafficking organisation. he gets some help from his friend and Police Inspector Tarconi played brilliantly by François Berléand who adds some humour to the film (and subsequent Transporter films).But what makes this such a great film is the introduction to film of the great character of Frank Martin, brilliantly played by Jason Statham. The fight scenes are really good and the ending does not disappoint.",9,0,0,26 November 2015
Legend," Good mainly because of Tom Hardy
","Tom Hardy is Brilliant in this and after a while you forget that he is acting both roles as Reggie and Ronnie. Nothing much new in this apart from the tragedy of Reggie's wife Frances and that is the slant that they put on this otherwise well known story, but it is in fact Hardy's portrayal of Ronnie that is most outstanding. he captures the true madness of the man without becoming a caricature.His portrayal of Reggie was also pretty much spot on and showed how he struggled with wanting to be a successful businessman but unable to escape his violent side.Without Tom Hardy's exceptional acting though the movie would have been pretty dull.",6,8,10,22 June 2017
Django Unchained," Tarrantino the one trick pony
","This could have been a good movie had it been made by someone who wasn't pretending he is an adult director when he is in fact an egotistical teenager in a mans body. Tarrantino really makes the same film over and over again but with a different theme. His films are unnecessarily violent, inaccurate and down right offensive to just about everyone.The story of Django Unchained is so full of holes as to be laughable and the characters are silly caricatures. As others have said this is a mix of Spagetti Western, Pulp fiction and Blazzing Saddles.Christopher Waltz plays his part as Dr. King Schultz so well that it makes the first part watchable and in a way the story itself leaves you wanting to know what will happen in the end. After all when you have already sat through two hours you hope against hope that at least the end will make some sense of it all. sadly it doesn't and once Christopher Waltz character is gone it then becomes just another Tarrantino excuse for a movie.Kerry Washington is a bright light in a dark film and you care for her character, but Jamie Foxx, who was amazing in Ray, is dull and a contradiction of character. There is one part of the film where he became totally unbelievable, there was no reason for him to allow Calvin Candie to set the dogs on the Slave when Schultz had offered to pay for him to be saved. Why would a man who went through so much evil and violent treatment himself just because of his colour, be so uncaring of those still in Slavery?If you could only take away the graphic violence, use of modern offensive speech, historical inaccuracies, dull acting, awful script and really childish direction and you might have had a good film.I would also add that the subject of Slavery and Racism are not really subjects to take as lightly as this film does. The kind of suffering inflicted on African's transported to the West and used and treated worse than animals is not in my opinion a subject that Mr Tarrintino should be attempting to make comical.And the Jamie Foxx character in a modern setting would be seen as a reactionary terrorist. He is not a positive character and I sick of Black and Asian people being portrayed in movies in such a negative way.Other films have handled the subject of Slavery in much more realistic and empathetic way.",1,18,29,17 February 2016
The Theory of Everything," Well deserved Oscar
","The Theory of Everything, is an interesting film with some truly brilliant acting especially on the part of Eddie Redmane who deserved his Oscar for an amazing transformation, at times you think it is the real Stephn Hawking. As it was with Jamie Foxx' portrayal of Ray Charles this is acting at it's very best. Felicity Jones was also brilliant as Jane Hawking and all the supporting cast were all very believable.The film itself concentrates on the relationship between Hawking and his wife and touches on the arrival of the Nurse Elaine Maso who in real life he eventually married, although the controversy surrounding her is not covered in this film. A lot of the film touches on the relationship between Jane and organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones although there is some ambiguity over what actually happens. The conflict between Jane's religious views and Stephens views are also touched on. It is a shame more was not made of Mr Hawkins brilliance as a Scientist but then that might be hard to put over in a movie where human relationships are easier to portray. Over all though this is a good film and worth a watch if only to witness the amazing acting of Mr Redmane.",6,0,0,21 March 2016
Schindler's List," I couldn't watch it again
","This is one of those films I am glad I watched, but doubt very much if I could ever watch it again. Not because it is a bad film, quite the opposite is true, it is a very well made film with top notch acting, directing, everything. But it's content is so disturbing and some of hte violence so graphic that I couldn't sit through it again. There type of films show the true horror of war rather than the romatasized or comic book approach that leads successive generations of young men to think that war is a glamorous career, when in fact wars are full of evil and horror as this film so aptly depicts. And at last Steven Spielburg got an Oscar, something he should have had many times before since he has produced some of the best films ever in my opinion.",9,9,13,10 March 2009
The Bourne Legacy," How Not to make a Bourne Movie
","This movie seems to have been made to cash in on the success of the three excellent Bourne movies.Maybe for that reason it was put together so poorly I don't know, but it is just not a Bourne movie and should not have the title just because it makes references to Bourne and what happened at the end of the Bourne Ultimatum.Rachel Weisz is good but could not rescue this movie alone. The main character Aaron Cross played by the awful Jeremy Renner just wasn't convincing in any way. I see that they may have signed him for a sequel to this nonsense. That should kill off the Bourne franchise sadly.",2,1,4,30 June 2016
Ex Machina," Not bad at all
",This is pretty well put together movie about AI and what makes it work in my opinion are two things.1. The special effects are amazing especially the main AI character and 2. Alicia Vikander is perfectly cast and acts brilliantly as the lead AI of the story Ava.The story works well and I won't spoil the ending although I did guess what was going to happen.The only bad aspect of the film was the over use of bad language which was unnecessary and added nothing to the film. It seems to me that people in films use profanity far more than in real life and it just grates on me.But over all this is worth a watch if only for the two reasons I gave above.,6,0,1,29 December 2015
Hidden Figures," Had to be told
","OK I appreciate this was not 100% accurate, I never believed Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) had to run miles to use a colored toilet and it was done for dramatic effect. I never believed all three women were quite as brilliant and that every white person portrayed was dumb and totally racist. But the movie tries to condense lot's of truth regarding America and especially the south in the early sixties and yes there was still segregation and the achievements of women and black people were overlooked and downplayed.
So on this level the movie worked and was pleasurable to watch.
Oscar winner Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughn a mathematician who develops a talent for programming computers but is denied a supervisory position by her supervisor (Kirsten Dunst). Katherine Johnson.
Janelle Monáe plays Mary Jackson, an aspiring engineer who is held back from becoming an actual engineer due to segregation.
Kevin Costner is the boss who puts his personal prejudices aside for the good of the Space race.
All actors did well in this movie and although it was not 100% historically correct it is well worth watching.
It does puzzle me why Hollywood feels that they cannot make a watchable historical movie and portray everything accurately.",8,2,4,30 January 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino Can Only Make One Film
","Quentin Tarantino is the most over rated movie director ever. He basically makes the same film over and over again with a different title. Excessive violence, vile bad language and childish humor, but absolutely nothing else. What is Kill Bill? Is it suppose to be an action movie? Kung fu? Japanese sword movie? Parody? Spoof? Whatever it is suppose to be it fails at every level.Uma Thurman is awful and doesn't fit the part at all. Lucy Liu is the only stand out actress but I wish she hadn't made this silly movie as she is much better than that.Mr Tarantino really needs to grow up and the movie going public needs to stop falling for his silly movies.Or if you must watch his movies, just watch one because they are all the same anyway.",1,15,28,8 December 2016
Jurassic World," Good special effects v Poor acting
","This was an OK movie with some amazing special effects. The Dinosaurs seemed very real and believable. There are more than a few jump out of your seat moments and some of the kills made me question the 12 certificate.Sadly the same cannot be said of most of the actors. I am not sure if it was just a poor script but it seemed like amateur night had been made into a movie. Apart from the Dinosaurs it all fell flat whenever a real person appeared.Bryce Dallas Howard was just awful, she seemed uncomfortable and not convincing in anything she did. Irrfan Khan seemed like a caricature of every Indian actor ever.Chris Pratt was OK and Vincent D'Onofrio probably the best of a bad bunch.BD Wong seems the same character in everything he is in and has an annoying habit of smiling at just about everything.Both the main child actors were nauseatingly bad and I cannot really be even referred to as actors.There were lots of plot holes and the ending was pretty predictable, it was almost a complete copy of the original JP movie but not done as well.",5,2,4,27 July 2016
Prisoners," Good film until the awful ending
","This was a good (if not too long) thriller that should have been so much better. I refer to the ending so if you don't want to know come off now.Hugh Jackman's character is seen as a tough guy who can certainly handle himself,that is until he comes up against a little old lady in her kitchen. He then acts totally out of character and does exactly what she asks even though it is obvious that she is not going to let him live, and he won't rescue his daughter. In the kitchen he could have easily over powered her, OK she had a gun but so did he in his bag. Or when she gave him the drink to weaken him, what does he do? He drinks it rather than through it in her face.Then the most stupid part. He gets into a car and reverses slowly as she asks him to, rather than reversing quickly to knock her over or oat least off her feet. And then he jumps down a hole so she can lock him in with the car over it.Sorry but none of this makes sense and it spoilt an otherwise good film.I also thought that Jake Gyllenhaal was a poor choice for his role as a cop, he was clearly unhinged and hindered the investigation, (then maybe cops are like that?). Terence Howard's character was the only one I believed out of all the parents and Paul Dano plays his part well as the mentally backward son of the nutty woman. I also thought that the film had too much unnecessary bad language, (Then I always find that people swear and curse more in movies than I ever find in real life(, But I put up with it as the story was gripping until the end.It is a real shame that this film ended the way it did. The silly ending with the whistle noise was so predictable as to almost turn this into a comedy.",3,1,7,8 February 2016
Silence," Dull and One sided
","I watched this and kept hoping it would actually start. It was so dull and boring with over long scenes that led nowhere.
But the worst thing about this movie was the one sided portrayal of traditional Japanese culture and religion. The series Shogun was much better and showed the Japanese and explained the reasons they behaved the way they did and what seemed like their incomprehensible acts of evil to those in the west.",2,4,7,18 November 2019
Mission: Impossible," Not Really Like The TV Series
","I was anticipating this movie as I was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s. What a major disappointment this was. The film begins OK, But then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that Hollywood churns out so often. Cruse is totally miss-cast and unconvincing,the point of the series was it's cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things. This was just the biggest disappointment on film I have seen, apart from the even worse 2 follow ups. I am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film, but Mission Impossible it is not. And Jim Phelps turning traitor? Please!!!",2,1,1,1 July 2013
Love & Mercy," Bad casting spoils it
","Paul Dano is brilliant as the young Brian Wilson, he captured him so well. The other actors playing various Beach boys were also well cast, but then along came John Cusack playing the older Brian Wilson and it was awful, spoiling an otherwise good movie.
There was no reason Paul Dano could not have continued to play the older Brian, movie makeup has come a long way and it could have really worked. Cusack looks nothing like Brian, not even remotely and every time it cut to him the movie lost all credibility. In fact the first time he appeared I had no idea who he was supposed to be.
When you see Brian Wilson himself singing at the end of the movie, it really drives home how badly cast John Cusack was. It is a shame as this could have been a brilliant biopic, but Ray it isn't.
There were some great scenes of early Beach boys, especially the live stage scenes and the making of the album Pet Sounds, and the song 'Good Vibrations,'
Mike Love, Dennis and Carl Wilson, all seemed reasonably well played if a little underused.
Elizabeth Banks played her part brilliantly and out-acted Cusack.
The actor playing Eugene Landy was also badly miss-cast and the scenes surrounding him showed Brian to be a weak almost childish person, not someone with drug and mental health issues.
The best parts of this movie are the recreation of the Beach boys making and performing their classic hits.",4,0,0,15 May 2020
Jack Reacher," Surprisingly good
","I am not the biggest Tom Cruise fan but I must say he pulls this off brilliantly. The story is a good one that keeps you guessing and gripped in the best thriller tradition. The action is good and not over done the characters are well rounded and believable. Rosamund Pike was very good and did not over play her part. It was also good to see the great Robert Duvall who is good in everything he does.Werner Herzog was suitably evil like a more sadistic Bond Villain. The plot was good and very cleverly thought out, did you guess it?There were parts of the film I didn't like much. The car chase was unnecessary and overly long but then I don't like car chases as much as Hollywood seems to. I look forward to watching the next jack Reacher film.",8,0,0,21 November 2016
The Da Vinci Code," Gripping and well acted
","Ok the story itself can be criticized for a number of reasons.
Some of the history related is accurate, other bits not so.
But commenting on the film, it is well acted and produced well.
The only downside is the end is somewhat an anticlimax.",9,0,0,29 August 2019
The Fountain," Beyond Boring
","Sorry but there are very few movies I cannot watch all the way through but sadly this is one of them. Despite a great cast and no doubt some expensive special effects, the way this movie was written and directed was just awful. It is pretty much impossible to follow, some tell me you need to watch it to the end to maybe get it, but life is too short for that.It starts off OK but quickly progresses into more and more nonsense and I was watching this with others who were equally bewildered.Perhaps the worse aspect of the movie is that very quickly I didn't relate to or care for any of the characters. No one in this movie behaves the way anyone in real life would behave.One of the worse movies I have tried to watch ... ever!",1,3,10,6 July 2017
A Hard Day's Night," When Music was this good!
","As a music movie this perfectly captured why the Beatles became such a phenomenon. Brilliant!
We get to see the characters of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr and this movie seems to capture the UK in the sixties brilliantly.
In fact Ringo stands out as the great actor he could have become.
It is hard to think of any other music movie that conveyed the true atmosphere of this time and it is still a joy to watch.
Very few movies of this type have stood the test of time, but the Beatles impact on music is so beautifully captured in this classic movie.",10,1,1,17 April 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Good special effects but sillyscript and characters
","The only plus I can think of is that Kong is very realistic unlike many Kong's in past films, the special effects team did a good job here, apart from how tall he is keeps changing.
But the movie itself has the most unrealistic story-line and even sillier characters. Samuel L Jackson is particularly bad, in fact I have never seen him act well in any movie he has been in. I wont go into all the stupid mistakes as many others have explained these in other posts, but this movie shows that good special effects do not in themselves make a good movie.",1,0,1,3 January 2018
The Lion King," I was a little disappointed
","OK I know I am probably alone here, but I was a little disappointed with this film. Maybe the hype surrounding it gave me greater expectations, who knows? I thought it was a good plot, (although an overused plot in movies)and some of the characters were really good. But I found parts of the movie boring and the music not up to Disney standards. Elton John got an Oscar I believe, but can't see why.Best parts of the movie are the interactions between Simba and Scar. In fact I thought that Jeremy Irons performance was outstanding.The animation was pretty hit and miss I thought.So sorry TLK fans but I wasn't thrilled by this movie.",4,8,12,18 July 2016
Murder on the Orient Express," Kenneth Branagh's massive ego trip
","Awful movie where Kenneth Branagh self indulges himself at every turn. He clearly believes he is a great actor, but is in fact awful and unbelievable as Poirot. His directing is even worse and why all those much better actors agreed to appear in this trash is the real mystery.",1,6,9,10 February 2020
Taken 2," OK its not as good as the 1st one but!
","OK its not as good as the 1st one but its still enjoyable.
The first Taken was much better and a hard movie to follow but this was OK.
Liam Neeson is his usual brilliant self and I actually found it to be a good action movie. I thought there was to much car chase and yes the plot was full of holes, but it is a movie after all.",7,0,1,22 January 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Rubbish
","By the time this over long tripe had finished I had lost all interest and could not wait to leave. The story was idiotic, the plot laughable and the characters totally unbelievable. Bane, was a silly pointless villain. What was his plan again? Oh yes to kill himself and everyone else? What tosh! And that crying scene that Michael Caine did? What was his point? It just looked like he had said to the director, 'let me do a bit of good acting, don't worry about the fact that what I am saying makes no sense' And Batman has his back severely damaged and is in a cell where he gets little food but makes the most miraculous recovery since Lazarus. In this film Batman is weak, the Villains are pointless, The plot is nonsense and the whole film seems to be riding on special effects for special effects sake! Won't be watching this again or buying the DVD!",1,6,11,1 July 2013
Black Panther," Disappointing
","I was looking forward to this but almost from the beginning I knew this was not going t be good.
The story was silly and very unbelievable.
Acting was wooden and the accents awful.
Why use Martin Freeman to play an American, no American actors I guess?
Fighting unrealistic and I could not believe the Black Panther character could win anything.
The ending was even sillier than the rest of the movie.",2,26,44,17 January 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Good but not quite great
","I enjoyed this movie for a number of reasons, especially the first hour and a half or so, but I felt it would be a better movie had it ended there. Some of the best special effects I have seen in any movie and the action and story are fast paced. That is until the monster Lex Luthor creates appears. It then becomes all rather silly. It should have ended with the Superman/Batman battle in my opinion. All the acting is top notch, Henry Cavill, Ben Aflek and Amy Adams are all brilliant and suit the roles better then many previously. Although Louis really should have had dark hair, it was Lana Lang who was a red head in the comics. Jesse Eisenberg is a great Lex Luthor with just the right hint of genius and madness. Laurence Fishburne is a bit flat as Perry White, as is Jeremy Irons as Alfred, but they aren't in many scenes.But over all an enjoyable watch.",8,3,8,31 March 2016
Saving Mr. Banks," Just Magical
","What a lovely and well made movie this is.Has Tom Hanks ever been bad in any film? I don't think he has, even in not so good movies he is always brilliant.This movie was really made and Tom is perfect as Walt Disney as is Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers.But what makes this so special is the way the story is told. The flashbacks to her early life helps explain her eccentric actions and it is almost like two movies in one.Annie Rose Buckley is brilliant as young Pl Travers or Ginty as her parents call her. Colin Farrel does a great job as her troubled Father who has such a big impact on her life.The movie is filled with just about every emotion and is a delight to watch.",10,1,1,28 December 2016
Unbroken," Very good True Life Account
","I don't understand all the negative reviews and it seems to be aimed at Miss Jolie. Exactly why is something only they would know but I watched this without even knowing who the director was and thought it was very well made. The story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete captured by the Japanese navy after a plane crash in the Pacific during the second world war is a harrowing tale which left me constantly amazed at the resolve of humans in the face of unbelievable hardship and cruelty. Jack O'Connell acts well and is totally believable as are all of the cast. Miyavi seemed a little too feminine looking to be playing the evil camp overseer Watanabe who seemed to take personal delight in torturing Zamperini. What came across is how Watanabe was jealous of Zamperini and bitter about his own shortcomings. I guess it shows that during war the bullies who are nobody's in civilian life and then have some power become so evil. this has also been shown by accounts in Nazi concentration camps.So over all I rate this as a very good film and about an amazing true life. Violent but not too graphic it is a tale of human resolve and desire to survive that many youths today would do well to study.",8,1,1,7 November 2016
Fantastic Four," Love this movie
","In my humble opinion this is one of the best Marvel movies I have seen. It just seems to capture the Fantastic Four exactly how I remember them from the comics.All the main characters Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm are pretty much perfect. Jessica Alba as Sue Storm is brilliant and Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm stands out as just about the perfect 'Thing'.The only downside for me was Victor Von Doom who just wasn't evil enough and missed what the comics showed him to be.However I thought the movie was great with some pretty impressive special effects.",10,7,10,18 July 2016
Spectre," Not bad at all
","I have never liked Daniel Craig as James Bond. For me he just lacks any sophistication and humour and doesn't look comfortable doing anything.I have never rated him and actually think he took Bond in the wrong direction. This isn't his fault I just think that the Bond producers wanted to copy the success of the Bourne films and ditched the near perfect Bond in Peirce Brosnan for the rugged looking Mr Craig.Now that being said this is one of the better Daniel Craig Bond movies. It is full of action from beginning to end with an excellent cast, especially Christoph Waltz, but I think it's success is that it returned more to Bond being Bond and not a Bourne clone.",8,1,2,27 July 2016
Braveheart," Wonderful Film
","One of the best films ever made. I know it may not be 100% accurate and I know that what was meant to be Scotland was actually filmed in Ireland but it still has everything a good film should have. All the actors were magnificent even those who did not have big parts. There is Action, Comedy, Romance, Pathos, Beauty, Violence and more. This film leaves you with a distaste for what the English did to the Scots, but also a feel good feeling when the Scots win a battle. When Wallace realises he is betrayed by Robert the Bruce the emotion Mel Gibson portrays really hits home. The ending also was really well done and again hits home. Highly recommended!",9,2,7,9 March 2009
Back to the Future," One of the all time great films
","Hard to find fault with this film in any way. This is the only film I have watched in the Cinema where the audience broke out in spontaneous applause at it's conclusion. Michael J Fox was perfect for the part and all the cast and Christopher Lloyd is exceptional, creating one of those characters that you will always remember. The 2 sequels are both good but nothing matches this first film and the excitement it generates. My only small criticism was the Johnny B Goode scene where a supposed relative of Chuck Berry says to him on the phone 'I've found that new sound you were looking for' .... When will black music artists start getting credit for giving us all the great genres of music? OK I know it was tongue in cheek humour but it just annoys me. Rant over! It is still a 10/10 movie.",10,1,1,10 March 2009
The Bourne Supremacy," Brilliant
","Often sequels fail miserably to match the first film, (Taken 2 and 3 for example)but this film is equally as good as the first.OK it bears no resemblance to the book but still captures the essence of the character.The way he is brought back to action after seeking a quiet life with Marie is well thought out. The death of Marieand the framing of Jason for murders he did not commit is a great plot and very well acted by all.The addition of Pamela Landy, played to perfection by Joan Allen adds a lot to this movie.The action is all good and it moves at a pace that leaves no time to get bored.Brilliant movie that can be watched over and over again!",10,1,2,30 June 2016
