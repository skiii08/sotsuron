The Blair Witch Project," Worthy horror flick for the 'thinking' viewer.
","Let's get it straight. If you are used to CGI monsters, special effects, and slick editing this movie is not for you.The BWP relies on your imagination supplying the horror. You will never see the Blair Witch, and you certainly won't get very far by carping about the films inadequacies. However if you are prepared to take it at face value you are in for a very good time indeed. Heather D running through the forest shouting 'What the f*ck is that!?' is the best you get - you have to supply the rest.Other warnings - you can only watch this once. If you watch it again, you know what's coming, and the surprise is gone. It just becomes a badly edited, annoying shaky monolouge. So, find a few good buddies (or love interest) get some popcorn, a dark room and watch it at night with the phone, and doorbell unplugged. Also do not listen to everyone else saying how good/cr*p it is. It's a very personal film, and you cannot judge it until you have seen it. I hope you enjoy it - I certainly did.",Null,0,1,29 May 2001
