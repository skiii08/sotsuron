Whip It," Fun and soulful coming of age film
","You watch a movie about roller derby expecting to have fun. What catches you is the family dynamic, the well-observed friendships and rivalries, and the left turns that go from what could be stock situations to moments that resonate.The performances ring true. Ellen Page continues to infuse her characters with light and presence. Marcia Gay Harden takes what could be a one-dimensional role and makes it live. And can't say enough about the girls, and the crazy training they all must have done.The real surprise, though, is Drew Barrymore's artistic eye and gift for storytelling in her first directorial role. The story and the characters are always presented well and the pacing is sure, but there are moments that sneak up and take your breath away.I saw this with my family, and commend it as a group experience in laughing together and talking about real stuff afterward.",10,3,8,13 February 2011
