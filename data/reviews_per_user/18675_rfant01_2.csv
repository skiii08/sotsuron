The Monuments Men," Surprisingly Serious
","With a cast like Bill Murray and John Goodman you'll think that this has a lot of comedy, but there is very little to laugh at, don't go in thinking there is. Though there are a few incidence of dry humor, some really good, they are very little and very few. A lot of the movie is just what the plot says, a group of middle age art experts, drafted into the army to chase down vast art collections stolen by the NAZI High Command to fill Hitler's planned 'Hitler Art Museum'.",8,0,2,17 June 2017
Darkest Hour," 10 stars because there isn't an 11th
","Perhaps the best historical based movie I've seen this century. The acting, and directing are unbelievable. The only weak areas are in cinematography, with the same 3 model airplanes appearing briefly multiple times, though the battle scenes are more background than germane, so they're acceptable, and barely noticeable amidst the great acting.",10,1,4,18 June 2018
