Ghost," Almost 20 years after release this movie still stands
","An evergreen after almost 20 years, this movie is still good to watch with the epic pottery scene. I love Woopy and Ratrick Swayze with their fiscal form of acting. And Sam's the never dying love for Molly. The character Carl is the worst best friend a man could ever wish for. But the story works very well and keeps you interested till the end",10,4,5,22 December 2018
