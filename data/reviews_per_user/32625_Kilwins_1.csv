Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Great Movie
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The animation is incredible, and the mixture between human and cartoon acting is wonderful. It is unique and fun for people of almost any age. Some of the language may not be suitable for young children, but that's not the point. Bob Hoskins does such a wonderful job, you can not even tell he's British in the film. Unless you happen to know that he is. The plot is very cartoon-ish, a man gets a safe dropped on his head. Then the rest of the movie is to try to figure out who did it. As the title suggests, you may think Roger did it, or was he framed? Take the journey through Toon Town and see what unfolds!",10,2,2,28 November 2003
