The Blair Witch Project," Completely Stupid
","I saw this movie at a $1 theater and left thinking I paid too much. This movie is ridiculously stupid. It's the dumbest movie I've ever seen. I got up at the end going 'huh? thats it? I'm not scared at all!' It plays on 'creepy' effect. Rustling and cracking branches, and implied circumstances but nothing to really scare you. I mean, if I were there I might freak out... but it really just comes off as dumb otherwise. It's just silly. Don't waste your money. The terrible thing is that I really cant tell you anything about it without spoiling it. I mean, really, you could probably condense the movie into 10 minutes. Ready?******* SPOILER *******Kids talk about myth. Kids go to explore in woods. Kids make camp and freak out over normal wood sounds. Kids lose map, get lost, argue and fight. Kids stumble upon house at night and 'die'? Thats it. Its mostly fighting. Its dumb.",1,3,6,28 January 2008
