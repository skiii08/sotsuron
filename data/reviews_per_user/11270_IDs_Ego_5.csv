Requiem for a Dream," more Style than Substance
","I tend to bash the films I think very little of, that nonetheless have a huge popularity. This is one of them.It's freaking #66 of IMDb's all-time as of this writing, but c'mon, what a meaningless, storyless piece of pap. The problem is, its style has less to do with drug abuse and more to do with an indulgent director's unique camera work. Sweeeeet. Cooooool. Like, Whoooooooooa. But have you ever actually heard that speed makes you hallucinate? No, because it doesn't. But it happens in this film, because, like, that's like, so wow.The film was powerful, but was also completely soulless bunko. I never read the book, but I suspect half the point was contrasting the legal prescription drug addicts to the illegal substance street addicts. But this was not explored at all.This film only showed finesse at showing human degradation. Frankly, that's the easy part. And this director definitely looked down his nose on his subjects. Using neato-keen camera techniques turns many filmgoers into fans, but if you notice the directorial style more than the story, the director is not doing his job, and in fact - in my biased opinion- sucks. This is one of those films.",2,4,8,14 January 2009
Crash," Preposterous, full of itself, and just not that good
","This movie has some very powerful moments and good acting. I'm not denying this. But it had moments that were so poorly thought through, it made the movie simply suck as a whole. Sorry to use the high-falutin' term PREPOSTEROUS, but that's what it is. Unfortunately, it begins with the first scene, where two carjackers are talking about how they're being viewed as- well, crooks.The double irony is not what I take issue with. What's incredibly stupid - so stupid that even punk-ass carjackers wouldn't do this -is that they hung out in a diner for an hour in the same neighborhood before committing a felony crime. Thus, collecting dozens of witnesses who'd be able to identify them. I'm no carjacker, but a tiny bit of common sense says you don't want to be noticed before committing a crime. But there it is, because it advances the 'story'. And Big Statement. Once you have something so incredibly stupid jammed into a script that purports to be 'real' JUST to make your Big Point - folks, that's called hackwork.Or how about one of the closing scenes, where the director stares at a burning car, then calls his wife on the cell phone? Gee, wasn't it as few hours earlier that his wife nearly got blown to bits in a explosive car wreck? So, does loving husband rush home? No. Guess it made a deeper scene this other way, the way it was shot. Oh, okay. Big Statement. C'MON!! I mean C'MON!!! Too stupid to accept. And it was the preposterous moments like that spoiled the rest of the film. Otherwise, it would be 'just okay' anyway. Because- I live in LA, and what I saw in this movie was a view of Los Angeles sprung from a state-of-the-art laptop somewhere up in the multi-million-dollar homes of the Hollywood Hills, from a mind of an aloof armchair liberal. The writer had an agenda, rather than any sense of LA's reality and real vibe--and worse, the writer seemed to have no damn common sense whatsoever. Well-meaning try, but not a classic, not even all that good.Industry folks can sometimes be too much like dogs licking their lowers. It's about LA, it purports itself to be deep and meaningful. Naturally, the Industry loves it, because they want to seem deep and meaningful, too. It's self-important hackwork tripe like this that gives LA its shallow reputation. While it has its moments and some good performances, it deserves to be buried in the discount bin, not lauded.Disappointment.",2,18,27,11 February 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The more Perfect film
","It's worth gushing about. The fact that Ahhnold is now the Governor of my California state simply adds facets to its viewing. It makes him look good, rather than the other way around. It adds laughs. T2 is, as you know, a great great film. Fans of this film have testosterone, smiles and admiration every time we talk about this film. When we think about this film - the 'time out!!', the T1000's brilliant, silvery, relentless fearless tactics, Sarah's ice-blooded cause('Men like you...'), and that damn tow truck, that damn Liquid gas transport... ('Hasta la...) we have seen a film that has no scenes anywhere that suck. None. How many films can you say that about??If you think the perfect film is one you can bring your girl to, you don't enjoy movies enough.",10,16,28,18 September 2004
District 9," Just because it's original sci-fi doesn't make it great.
","While 'District 9' is a very original take on the 'visitors from another planet' idea, when you scrape off that veneer, you will just find another pile of processed pulp. To make it more 'real', the movie employs a documentary style. While effective in creating that environment, it then drifts into a typical 'Hollywood' plot structure, that being the standard 'two mismatched guys on the run' story (Midnight Run, Fled). Is just that this time, they're literally from different worlds.I didn't buy in. Too many implausibilities, starting with how the Big Bad Villain, a private weapons company, is the only group that has access to the aliens. C'mon, it would be some kind of international coalition, okay? The Big Message points (racism) would still come through. Instead, the movie gets weighted down with very clichéd plot devices such as the buddy chase, the McGuffin (the power source twenty years in the making), and even a moppet-like child prawn. There are plenty more, and it became annoying after a while – although the action was fun.The fact that it's current rank as of August 20 is the same as Casablanca's is a farce. There's a saying: 'You don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle'. Fanboys who rank this movie so high are too often caught up in the sizzle, and barely notice that the steak is another piece of pulp cranked out by the Hollywood meat grinder.I give a three: five stars for being engaging, but overall mediocre and annoyingly clichéd; minus two for the big disappointment that is.",3,91,183,20 August 2009
War of the Worlds," If Spielberg could just stop being so Spielberg-y....
","He can do it, like in 'Saving Private Ryan' - which I really liked- or a less epic, but really good 'Catch Me if you Can'. But while it was, in all, a good film, too many distracting elements hurt it for me. The little girl's lines were, at times, not what a precocious 10-year-old would say. Rather, they were what a precocious 45-year-old seasoned Hollywood scriptwriter would say, if they were a little girl. Strike one.And Spielberg's set design indulgences (seriously flawed in Minority Report, in particular) also popped up like a bad zit. Example: When the first tripod emerged I saw a scissor-jack which was on the sidewalk to replace the letters on a movie marquee. A scissor-jack for THAT??? C'mon, that's what ladders and poles are for. However, you do see those very expensive machines aplenty on a Hollywood backlot. Example 2: a 250 Kg V-8 engine on the kitchen table. Its supposed to show Cruise's character is wrapped up in his tinkering, but THREE men can't get that up a flight of stairs, and he HAS A GARAGE on ground level, hello. Couldn't they at least present an engine you can CARRY UP THE STAIRS??? So it seems like Spielberg and his set designer haven't the common sense to leave the studio backlot and see the real world. Strike TWO.The ending, where even the son who went running into firestorm of death shows up fine for the happy family reunion in Boston. Why not throw in a whelp of puppies and a litter of kittens? Too much? So that's Strike THREE. The ending killed it for a lot of people I know. Like chocolate syrup on a good steak.So much was good about the film; Spielberg's depiction of group panic, Cruise sold me on the irresponsible father, and there was a menacing monster that was killing for sport before killing for their harvest. But there were too many other things that make me ask 'WHY did you DO that???' There are pro's and con's about this film, and if you don't get into the details, like I do, you'll enjoy it. But dang it, I see so many places where it could have been better.:-D",4,1,2,17 July 2005
