Blade Runner 2049," Too short for a 30 years wait. Love is on its way...
","How much have we mature as an audience in the last years?, or even as a society?. Blade Runner is a testament of what art originally is, a backbone to carve your own dreams and ideas, differently enough from the simple 'visit & praise' to some artist/director 'vistion' or what is more common today, a direct 'in rails' dreams of a sort without a personal should of its own. This movie accomplished to bring such a dream from 1982 to our day, we can only dream that kids today would fell what we felt back then.Blade Runner always was, and thanks to god, it is today also a Movie that helps you dream your own facts behind the main plot, Blade Runner should never have a complete plot and is by no mean a coherent 'human' world, which should at least ring a bell or two. This 'lingering between logic and whats real' is what Blade Runner is for the cinema art history: 'The chance of giving you new hopes to dream beyond what you can see, and whats most important, even bigger that what the director waned you to see. Blade Runner should make you free'.I was searching for this over the years, as the original Blade Runner marked that young heart with questions of logic from very simple sources like: 'How can a city be so big in such a small time', 'how can the dates not match reality'... to those that are really complicated 'What is the lore on nexus 1?', 'What about real humans, are there any remaining, how can we know?', 'how come no one ever speaks about AI?, did people in said reality jumped from AI directly to sential cyborgs?', 'is deckar love for Rachael something of batch of code being returned from sentient AI?'...As a kid this kind of questions made me obsessed of a deeper meaning behind Blade Runner, and so the real door to good quality Sci Fi opened for the rest of my life. I would certainly not be half of the man i am today without the gift of Blade Runner in my life.Blade Runner 2049 is driven by this consciousness of something 'else' behind the world it represents, not touching the facts, but letting them float above your head, reminding me of the best child dreamer in me, it is still very much inside. Otherwise whats the point?, if ideas like Blade Runner universe being a complete sentient society of robots, as humans uploaded their brains on Nexus 1, without those ideas, probably our real world would be sincerely less complete, and things like Matrix might never got developed in the first place. Real art is a revolution of the sense that bring new art, real art is a soul with sentient capabilities.In other words, i cant thank enough for the makers of this movie for not touching the 'fiber' that is the mystery of Blade Runner, i strongly think that they understand what real nerds of Blade Runner think & fell about this universe, what is beyond apparent, what is a dream, how everything moved and felt, like they where all machines after all, aren't we all machines anyway?. Read the book.Humans building their way in sentient bodies generation after generation, deckar and Rachael being how GOD or 'we Nexus 1 humans' are trying to get back to earth, as all our consciousness is trapped without a correct resolve. NO, whoever that went to the movie and lacked the feeling of there being something else, missed the whole point, Blade Runner 2049 was the real deal, the only reason i am giving it an 8 is that i am not 100% sure they understand the implications or just replicated what ridley scott did with much luck, anyways, copy art can be as good as real art if it helps keeping the should much intact, which is better thank changing something perfect.Blade Runner should make you dream, and pick your own backstory beyond what is apparent. Never trust somebody that reviews Blade Runner 2049 without touching the facts of 'dreams' and 'sentient cyber punk', just think for yourself inside, is Matrix compared to Balde Runner a middle step in making people think what was once only accessible for smart people in 1982?. what is next a movie about how god created the universe? ain't that just real life?.Art that respects art is good art, art that tried to add something out of love is best art and new art, there is no new art without love, there is no respect in ignorance and hate. Only love will make us survive, humans are coming to earth again, are you ready replicants?, that is how to life 'forver'",8,2,7,8 October 2017
