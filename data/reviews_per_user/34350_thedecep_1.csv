Blade Runner 2049," Enjoy the ride
","I've never bothered to write a review and this is less a review than just a note about some of the misgivings from a number of other reviews. In the negative reviews run time has been noted as a major factor for poor marks. Let me just make this clear, this movie gets the run time it respectfully deserves. Not only a movie but a journey into another world that may not be so distant, it is stunning and brilliant. One thing i absolutely love in sci fi movies, games and TV shows is quality sound effects and music and this is the best i have heard. A must see at the cinema to experience that sound, and then those visuals on the big screen, truly breathtaking. Back to the run time yes 90 minutes is fine for a comedy or basic action movie but for a masterpiece like this to come in under 140 minutes would not do it justice. Enjoy the ride, if you cant handle a true cinematic experience stick to the sitcoms.",10,12,27,6 October 2017
