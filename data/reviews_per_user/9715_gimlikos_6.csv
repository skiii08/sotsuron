Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My first Star Wars movie and I love it to this day !.
","I don't understand so much negatives to JAR JAR BINKS. I like the way George Lucas made this movie. This World is so magick and the soundtrack i so wonderful. I like the story and I like the characters. I think The Phantom Menace has the best lightsaber fight scenes ever made in the Star Wars history. I still love episode 4,5,6 as well as 1,2,3. Pod racing is the one of the best action scene ever made to this day. Qui-Gon Jinn is my favorite Jedi ever ;]. Did I say anything about beautiful soundtrack.WoooW just WooooW. So bad George Lucas will never make any new Star Wars ever. In the end I hate episode 7 ;]. JJ.Abrams Star Wars is like Star Trek in the space.",10,23,35,5 January 2016

Bohemian Rhapsody," This is one of the best movie I have ever seen !.Thank you to all directors ;] and producers ;].
","I give this movie 10\10 not because I have always loved Queen ;], but because this movie is just awesome.The last 15 min of this movie is like dream come true for all Queen fans ;].Mind blowing and so emotional !.All actors were great , but Rami Malek as a Freddie Mercury is like from another world !.If this guy will not get an Oscar , than I will never see the Oscar ceremony again !.
You all should see in IMAX , at least for the lat 15 min ;].The last 15 min will blow you away !.Its just mind blowing ;].Yes Im using the word Mind and blowing very often ,but it fits to this movie so well ;]Mind blowing movie !.Queen forever !.Thank you again for this movie !",10,3,4,10 November 2018
The Lion King," What is wrong with all these critics?.Love it, love it so much, In spite of bad reviews.For me this is the best version of Lion King.Just go and see this movie.10\10
","Love it, love it so much, In spite of bad reviews.For me this is the best version of Lion King.Just go and see this movie.10\10
I understand all these critics, and I understand all these not critics.For me this new Lion King movie has more emotional moments that the original version, because its so real and realistics with one of the best CGI I have ever seen.
The director made something that I have never seen in Cinema Theatre.
Dont listen all these critics from old people that love the original version.Just go and see it because its awesome.
Im not a fan of the original version of Lion King,but this one is what I have always wanted to see with the new technology.Its just WoW.I really recommend it.",10,1,13,25 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I have no idea why so many people hate The Last Jedi !.So much better compare to The Force Awakens.Just go and see this movie!.Dont listen critics!
","I have no idea why so many people hate The Last Jedi !.So much better compare to The Force Awakens , and one of the best Star Wars movie ever !.The last 30min of the movie is so Epic and emotional.Just WOOOOOOOOOOW!.Because episode 8 is so much different to the other Star Wars movies, I love it!.Something new , and something fresh !.
I love the story.I love all charaters.I love comedy scenes,and I have no problem with Rose Tico ,that many people hate her!I really like her character.She was great for sure!.
All action scenes were great and special effects were awesome!.So much better compare to The Force Awakanes!(I hate that movie ;]).
Too bad that the Soundtrack Music is not as AWESOME as from Star Wars The Phantom Menace ;], but even though the music still was OK!.Nothing special ;].Poeple dont listen bad reviews and bad critics.Just go and see this movie because this is one of the best Star Wars movie ever.The new Blade Runner is still the best movie of 2017 ;], but was so close ;].",10,1,10,20 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The force is so week with this one.JJ.Abrams You fail!.Its not about that this movie is so bad.Its about that this is the worst Star Wars movie ever !
","Because of this movie,I miss George Lucas so much.I think this is copy, and paste from episode 4 ,but way much worseeeeeee compare to the old1. I don't like characters.I don't like action sequences, especially lightsaber fights.I love practical effects ,but in this movie some effects look so bad like from the 60s.Come on!!!. Music is very average and has nothing to do with beautiful scored from Episode 1,2,3!.Where is Duel of fates?. In the end I just want to say that this is no more Star Wars movie as we all knew from the past.Its rather Star Trek movie but in the worse way. So many bad decisions in this movie I found.No George Lucas , no Star Wars.",4,27,33,4 January 2016
