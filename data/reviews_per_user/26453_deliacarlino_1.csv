Hereditary," True Horror
",This was most definitely the scariest movie I have ever seen. It is not the traditional form of horror filled with jump scares that don't stay with you. This movie is haunting beyond belief and stays stuck in your head. The cinematography is beautiful and the transitions are fantastic. There is really nothing bad that I can say about this movie. If you want a true horror experience watch this movie.,10,2,5,1 September 2019
