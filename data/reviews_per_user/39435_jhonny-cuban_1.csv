Source Code," Good movie
","I like a lot see movies, and this is the kind of movie that ends and you ask yourself: Already finished, where did my hour and a half?, it's that good that you don't realize the time has passed. This history is also well narrated as innovative, not so complex like 'The Matrix'; however, a really well done product. For the guys like me, who like to enter in the plot of the movies and try to make sense of it comparing to the real life, I can tell you that this movie is very good on that. To me the use of the science fiction according with the current advances in the science is very acceptable and it can be a reality in some point of our future like many others things that the science fiction has predicted that could be done. We can buy it almost all the stuff that they are telling us, except parts of the final when......... :)), see the movie; though, is nice and I like it because we need to see the world like a beautiful thing and dreams don't cost anything, also we are used to the Hollywood endings. I hope you enjoy the movie like I did.",8,0,1,17 July 2011
