The Rock," good movie but what's with the stereotypes
","Well paced, and entertaining movie - so why does it pander to the lowest common denominator audience ?For example, in the initial hostage taking scene, the black female hostage, angry and feisty, hollers that she should have brought her own gun. Further on, we have a gay hairstylist who swoons over Connery's character, and describes himself as an 'artiste'.It's almost has if the movie is trying to squeeze out reactions from a the knuckle-headed audience it predicts will flock to it.   Be assured, the reactions in tries to evoke are both base banal.A condescending chuckle here -- yep those haristylists sure are gay!  A knowing smile there -- those fiesty angry black women, you can't beat 'em!The movie would have been better off without this.",Null,1,1,3 November 1999
