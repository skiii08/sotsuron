It," You'll Float Too!
","Oh my god, greatest movie ever. A great adaptation of a great book. The cast is amazing, showing off great acting skills, I would say it was real fear. And does anybody know if Bill Skarsgard is A real Pennywise. It sure seems like it. If anybody says It is Sh** you don't have a life. Warner Bros you have done it again, can't wait for the 2019 sequel!",10,2,5,3 October 2017
Armageddon," One of the greatest movies I've ever seen
","I almost never write reviews for anything but this deserves it. Don't listen to the 1 star, 'terrible acting' and 'terrible story' . This is an amazing movie, with the perfect amount of action with great comedy sprinkled in there. Overall, it was just an amazing movie. 10/10 recommend, also 10/10 you will cry",10,6,8,10 November 2019
