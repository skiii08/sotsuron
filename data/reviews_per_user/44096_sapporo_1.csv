Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What can be said?
","This felt a long time ago, somewhere far, far away. I enjoyed all performances. The only cheapening element was the overuse of Jar Jar. There shouldn't need to be THAT much comic relief, as it approaches the tactics Hollywood uses. He was a good character, but tone him down. Lucas should know better...Ewan McGreggor...superb. Liam Neeson...superb. Jake Lloyd...great. I don't have too much wrong to say, only the annoying things, which were so few, it's a shame they were included, as they knocked a point off my rating.One final gripe (the third, in the shadow of a beautiful film): without reinventing Yoda, if they could only have fixed him up to be a little less puppet-like. I realize we've know him since Episode 5, but if they could have articulated his lips or something. What's one more special effect in the midst of such splendor?",9,0,0,23 May 1999
