"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Best Aussie movie
","This is my favourite Aussie movie of all times - a classic hilarious comedy in Australian tradition.There are 3 aspects of the movie which make it such an outstanding entertainer.Firstly, it's the brilliant screenplay by writer-director Stephan Elliott about 3 drag queens - a gay, a bisexual and a trans-sexual - from Sydney going on a bus to Alice Springs, a distance of over 2000 Kms to the centre of Australia, for a public performance. It's a road movie unlike any I have seen before, outrageously funny in one moment and poignant and touching the next.Second, the performances by the 3 lead actors are outstanding. It's hard to pick one which has outshone the others. My personal favourite, like a lot of others, is Terence Stamp as the trans-sexual.Third, the stunning costumes are worth watching just for themselves. Some of the scenes in the movie where we see the characters in their wildly colourful costumes against the background of an outlandish landscape are breathtakingly beautiful and memorable.It's a movie one can see many times, and enjoy it every time.",9,9,12,18 September 2008
Brokeback Mountain," Overrated
","Brokeback Mountain is a reasonably good film, but nothing like the hype it's been made out to be. It reminds me a little of John Schlesinger's 1969 movie Midnight Cowboy, which was way ahead of its time. Without denigrating Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal performances, Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight were sensational in Midnight Cowboy. I have seen 4 Ang Lee directed movies (Eat Drink Man Woman, Sense and Sensibility, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and this one), and they all are well-made commercial movies, but none of them are great or original in any way. It was therefore a surprise to me this movie winning best director Oscar. Even the screenplay was very jumpy, and left a lot to be desired - there was no real insight into what the two characters shared emotionally between them to carry on their affair for 20 years, in spite of having girlfriends, wives, children and individual lives of their own. I believe, both the movie and director are bit overrated.",5,4,30,21 April 2007
