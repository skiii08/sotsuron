The Avengers," Avenger's Summary
","This movie was amazing! You should only see it if you saw Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America, and Hulk. I would recommend this movie to everyone any age! If you are considering watching it, just go watch it right now, you will be amazed! I even happened to find a better trailer for the Avengers on http://q.gs/1816460/marvel-avengers. Also, this website will help you find cheap tickets at your local movie theater! This movie will not let you leave the movie theater feeling unsatisfied or bored, it will let you leave feeling happy and thrilled to have seen the movie. This is a great action packed movie for you and your movie. Have fun watching the Avengers!!!",8,0,2,20 May 2012
