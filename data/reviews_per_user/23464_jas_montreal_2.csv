50 First Dates," Always A Reliable Laugh
","I really like this movie! I thought that Adam Sandler was hilarious like usual and Drew Barrymore was awesome. It's their second movie together and I think think they should do more. Although this is not the typical Sandler movie, I did bring my boyfriend to see this and he liked it too. I must admit that it's more of a romantic comedy just like The Wedding Singer but still fun for everyone.(Spoiler) I love Sandler and how funny he is but the fact is, is that I cannot picture how the movie begins by portraying him as a major player who sleeps around with different women until he meets Barrymore's character. Despite that, I love the way he transforms his ways and becomes devoted to her.I also like how they expanded Rob Schneider's character in this movie than in the other Sandler flicks. Everyone whose seen all of Sandler's movies knows that some of the actors have parts in every one whether it's big or small. So seing that Schneider was one of Sandler's best friends and had more scenes in it than, for example his cameo in The WaterBoy saying 'You can do it!', was a riot!As a surprise, Sean Astin's character plays Barrymore's older brother. He buffed up quite a bit from his role in LOTR as Sam. (Spoiler) However, he does wear alot of fishnet tanks, has a speach impediment, is addicted to heroine and has many 'wet dreams'. So even though his character is a bit of a looser, I do admire Astin's courage and acting skills to play this demeaning part.(Spoiler) The story turned out to be very sad in a good way. Because you're hoping that she'll regain her short-term memory by the end of the film but, like in real life, it'll never happen. Sandler obviously learns to live with that but it must be extremely hard to live with. Just picturing how she wakes up every morning and not knowing that she's married or that she has a little girl, that just touches your heart.My final words, I love the concept of the storyline and thinks it should be watched with an open mind and not be disappointed when there's not much gross jokes and gags. Definately a must see in theatres!!!",Null,0,0,8 March 2004

","I have to admit that I was very reluctant to watch this movie at first. (Spoiler) Just because I don't really like watching action or subtitled films. But everyone kept recommending me to watch it and said it was really better than I could ever imagine. And they were right!I was really surprised at how acurate and real this movie was. I already knew how talented Tom Cruise is, but this has to be one of the best I've ever seen him in! (Spoiler) Not only did he do most of the stunt work, but I was especially impressed at how he spoke japanese. This movie could've easily been like any other hollywood movie where all the characters speak english and it doesn't seem odd that they know it so well. But that he took the time to learn the language and that the rest of the actors were allowed to speak their native tongue. I don't see how it would be otherwise because it would've been just as bad as that Bruce Willis movie Tears Of The Sun.I also loved the sexual subtleties between Cruise and Koyuki's characters. She's not the typical beauty of mixed blood, but of demure and angelic beauty that represents the fragile asian nature. And I admire any woman who'd go on screen wearing very little make-up when acting next to Cruise. There was no nudity or sex, but the tension and desire they immitted was intense.(Spoiler) It is a sad movie because it demonstrates the horrible side of humans by killing off one of the heroes that actor Ken Watanabe plays. But brings life into prespective and shows how some are willing to give up their lives for their principles.My final words, I highly recommend this movie to everyone and hope every person gets a little something from this experience!!!",Null,1,2,8 March 2004
