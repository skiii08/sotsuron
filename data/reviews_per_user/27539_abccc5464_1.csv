Iron Man 3," Why a new director?
","I really enjoyed the first two movies. I was very excited and drawn in by the dark trailers for this one. My disappointment isn't so much about this just being a poor movie, it is more about the direction the characters and story went. Here we go....I'm devastated by what they did to War Machine. They can not include him in any movies after this one. He's was just so emasculated in this movie and he can't be taken seriously now.Ben Kingsley was building a very good Mandarin character and then that crashed and burned. I understand that he wasn't 'actually' the Mandarin, but the trailers and the first half of the movie built you up for that. The plot twist just didn't work and left me really disappointed. That sort of plot twist can work if the real bad guy is more interesting than the fake one. That wasn't the case here and a real director would have known that.So... anybody can wear and operate an Iron Man suit? No training or security access required? Not good writing, it's just not good writing.Both Stark's and Killian's technology in this film were over the top. Yes, I know it is based on a comic book and had to be stepped up since the last film, but the tech in this movie was strictly fantasy with no effort towards realism at all.I guess my biggest disappointment is that this isn't just one movie. This is the entire Marvel Universe that is taking a hit with this one. After the excellent work on the Avengers last summer, to see the characters and story line be so damaged by a new director is disappointing.",4,1,2,5 May 2013
