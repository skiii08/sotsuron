The Blair Witch Project," Your reaction will depend on your imagination
","If you have a rich, vivid imagination and a fascination with the subject matter, I think you'll enjoy this. This movie was somewhat of a pre-reality era movie in that I don't remember any other cinema movie of this style being popular before, and certainly not hyped as having real footage. I do not understand how an adult or even a teenager could be naive enough to believe this footage was real, but I guess that added to the thrill for many.Without question, not actually showing everything built suspense and mystery. The entire film would have collapsed like a house of cards if they had introduced a green skinned woman with a pointy hat at the end (LOL). Instead, we got a very cool ending. Along the way, you'll have to endure some overbearing acting by the female lead, but overall, this is worth watching at least once. You probably won't feel the need to watch it again after that for quite a long time, but it is an enjoyable experience nonetheless. It unfortunately typecast the actors (especially the female lead) forever as 'that guy/girl in Blair Witch', but the men who made this film undoubtedly had no need to ever work again after this (budget $60,000 for a gross of $248 million, you do the math..). Definitely a one trick, one time pony, but an amusing one.",7,0,2,4 July 2011
Clash of the Titans," Absolute Failure......
","This is the most wretched waste of time I have seen in many, many years. Utterly inferior to the classic 1981 original (one of my all time favorite movies!), it was a true chore to watch this. In fact, I couldn't make it all the way without fast forwarding through some of the duller sections. It has the dubious distinction of being the only one star movie that I actually took the time to review here.How is this a failure? Let me count the ways. For starters, it was totally miscast. Greek demigod Perseus looks and talks like an Aussie rugby player with a 2010 haircut? Zeus wearing northern European knight's armor from the Middle Ages? Who approved these decisions??!!! There wasn't a single memorable character. The original had Harry Hamlin who looked to be the very personification of Perseus, and the great Burgess Meredith to lend weight to the movie and a generally excellent cast.Then you have several key scenes out of sequence, or cut altogether such as the awesome early appearance of the Kraken from the original! Since this film HAS nothing else, they should have had the Kraken on-screen as often as possible. I give honorable mention for the creepiness of the Medusa scene, but it is cheapened by Medusa groaning like a frustrated cheerleader when she misses a shot with her bow and general bad editing. Wow. The Kraken itself was impressive enough and provided the most exciting moment in the film when he was seen rapidly swimming toward Argos, then surfacing like an emerging volcano. But you have to wait (or fast forward) through this entire dog to see that scene. So much wasted potential. Just think what could be done with this story in the right hands using CGI tech....I've said it many times to the point of sounding like a broken record, but CGI more often than not ruins modern movies in my opinion, especially remakes of old classics. I suppose anyone that is a big fan of this failfest probably isn't even old enough or aware enough of history to know what a record is anyway......",1,3,4,10 July 2010
