The Longest Yard," I was anxious for it to be over
","I generally like Adam Sandler movies. I've gotten used to his crudeness and vulgarity. I don't accept them, and I'm sure he would be funnier without them, but I expect his personal habits to be gross and disgusting. I also expect him to have some redeeming quality, being nice to some kid or kind to some less fortunate old woman or something. I don't think Adam Sandler stars in this movie. I think he goes through the motions as though some body-snatcher had taken over for him. He has the same predictable ending where the bad guy decides to be good at the last minute, but the lead role could have been played by an extra.***** Spoiler: don't read this is you haven't seen the movie ***** As for Chris Rock's part in the movie, when he dies and they had their little memorial service for him, I wasn't sad at all. In fact, I was kind of glad he was gone. During the big game, I hoped Adam Sandler would be killed off so Burt Reynolds could play quarterback and save the day. That would have made a much better ending.",3,0,2,7 July 2005
Madagascar," Where has all the humor gone?
","Among all the constant bickering between Chris Rock and Ben Stiller, there were two funny lines that actually got me to consider laughing, though I didn't actually do it. Unfortunately, I don't remember what those lines were. I know we're supposed to be impressed by how cute these little animals are with their fancy animation, but they were always either arguing about how hard they have it or singing praises about how great they are. As for being a role model for children, if any of my children acted the way these characters do, I would beat them soundly and send them to bed. And the moral of this story is . . . No matter how good your computer-generated animation is, a bad script will still make a bad movie, regardless of who does the voice-overs. This would be a good movie for children not yet old enough to talk, but I would wait for the DVD.",2,2,5,7 July 2005
Spice World," Fantastic Fun and Music for the Whole Family
","There hasn't been a collection of this much feminine beauty in one group since the Lennon Sisters. I love their music. I love their happy attitude about life. I love the light-hearted, jovial way this movie presents itself. It's a spoof. If people weren't so uptight, it would receive a much higher rating than it has. I'm almost fifty years old, and I have nine children. I have probably watched this movie over a hundred times. When I first got the DVD, I watched it with my kids almost every day. My wife thinks it just because I'm in love with the girls, whom I do think are beautiful, but it's actually because of the jokes. It's not just a few; the movie is full of them. I see it as being as funny as Monty Python or Benny Hill. It's the kind of humor you love to quote. I highly recommend it.",10,2,4,29 June 2005
Troy," Great battle scenes with some nice acting and a good story
","This was a very realistic portrayal of an almost mythological story. Perhaps it really happened this way. All the characters were well-acted, even the sniveler Paris, played by Orlando Bloom, but especially Peter O'Toole, who is brilliant. From the first battle between Achilles and a Goliath-like giant of a man, we learn that speed and agility are more important than size and brute strength.But this movie is about more than just battle scenes and violence. It's about philosophy and politics and faith. It's also about love, but not just romantic love between a man and a woman. It's about Achilles' love for his brother, whom Hector kills, and Hector's love for his brother, Paris. It's about Peter O'Toole's love for his son, Hector and his faith in his Gods. It's a little long with its big battle scenes, but otherwise this is a very good movie.",9,23,44,12 July 2005
Alien," One of the first real science fiction movies
","The beginning of Alien is fabulous. We're in the future on what seems like the kind of spaceship that will actually exist in the future, with the kind of technology that we, at that time, thought we would have in the future. The whole film is very realistic, making the suspension of disbelief very easy for me. The acting is fantastic with characters who have the same problems getting along with each other that we often do, and the same 'colorful' language that keeps my wife from letting my kids watch this movie. The only flaws with the film is that the humans are sometimes a little stupid, staring and screaming at the alien instead of shooting it, and that our star risks her life for her stupid cat. The great risk is that if the alien got back to earth, it could wipe out the planet, giving our protagonists the chance to be noble by self-destructing their ship.This was a serious movie. It didn't have the silly dialog that kept star wars light and happy. These people didn't use the force or any other fantasy goblins or vampires. This was deep, dark, hard-core science fiction of the best kind, and it was very well done.",10,1,3,29 June 2005
The Thing," A rare combination of a great story, great acting, and good special effects.
","From the beginning of this movie, you don't know whom you can trust. It soon becomes evident that the danger is not just to the few people at this antarctic station, but to the whole world if this monster reaches civilization. Sometimes the reactions of the people don't make much sense, but they're scared out of their wits, and understandably so. This film leaves you with some great images, such as a disembodied head growing legs and running away, and you will never want someone to put his fingers near your mouth again. It's more than just suspenseful; it's realistic. It could really happen. We'll have to hope that aliens like that never come to this planet. Even at the end, you aren't quite sure if the alien is really dead. I'm just glad I don't have a pet dog.",10,1,2,29 June 2005
"I, Robot"," Special Effects mask a good story
","The basic premise of this movie, that an intelligent computer, if put in charge of running everything, might decide it knows what is better for us than we do, and therefor restrict out freedom, is a great idea. That the genius human creator of this computer would realize what he had done, be opposed to it, and try to stop it is still a very good idea.The idea that he would have to create a special robot, make it kill him, and team up with Will Smith to stop the computer in charge, well that starts over toward the ridiculous. The way the computer tries to kill Will Smith, and is unsuccessful in all it's attempts, is just downright stupid. They've turned a great science fiction story into a ridiculous fantasy with their special effects. If you are able to suspend your disbelief and not think about these things, then this is a great movie for you.",5,0,0,11 July 2005
Spider-Man," More of a story than your typical super-hero
","I loved the Spiderman comics when I was a little kid, forty years ago, but all I remembered was a bad guy named the Kingpin. I didn't even remember that Spiderman had a girl friend or an aunt. I didn't expect that the Spiderman movie would have much of a story other than catching crooks, just like flies. Boy, was I wrong.Peter Parker is just a dorky kid like I was. Pretty smart, but not too smooth with the ladies. Definitely not a bragging, trouble-making jerk like some of his peers in the film. When he gets the spider bite, he starts becoming a jerk, though, even sassing his Uncle, who is like a father to him, telling him 'you're not my father.' This is what makes for a good story. He starts to become bad, then realizes what is happening, and changes himself to become really good. He repents. He rises out of the one dimensional into a character we can really care about. That's what makes a great movie.",10,0,1,29 June 2005
Ocean's Eleven," More than a surprise ending
","Most people are surprised by the ending of this movie. I was also surprised, and I usually am not. The mumbling presentation of the preparations for the heist leave out just enough so we don't quite understand what is going on. This can often be frustrating for an audience, but in this case there is enough humor and suspense to keep our interest. Matt Damon's role as an eager but not very experienced crook provides both the humor and the suspense. We want him to succeed because he is such a nice guy, but he is so green that we fear he will mess the whole thing up. I would have given him the Oscar for this movie. He distracts us beautifully from what is really going on.When our eleven thieves, the good guys in this movie, are on the verge of being caught by the wary casino owner (played by Garcia), we feel bad for what we think is their imminent demise. But the twist is that they have fooled us all. When the SWAT team comes in to arrest them, there is no one there. It's not until after the SWAT team leaves that we realize the whole thing was staged, and our friends, the crooks, were playing the SWAT team, and they took all the money.The big problem with this movie is that our protagonists are criminals. 'Root, root, root for the bad guys; if they get caught it's a shame!' It's not exactly as American as baseball and apple pie. It is more entertaining than most crime dramas.",8,0,0,15 August 2005
Batman Begins," A bit over-the-top, but a good story
","Spoiler*** Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie yet*** The good guys turn out to be bad guys. This is one of the things I thought made the movie really interesting. Liam Neeson plays a really great character, but after he teaches batman everything he needs to know to be a great superhero, we find out he wants to use his 'superheroness' to destroy Gotham City. The girl, Katie Holmes, makes a fairly attractive love interest, and she is as goody-goody as Batman is dark. The special effects are not over-done and don't ruin the movie as they do in some other movies. This movie has several twists and surprises, all of which fit in with the logic of the movie and are very well done. The movie is a bit long and slow-moving in some parts. There are a bunch of great actors in this film; they should have been allowed to do more acting. There are too many fight scenes and crime scenes and too much sneaking around. Batman's interest in the woman was confusing. I wasn't really sure if she was his sister or his girlfriend; you couldn't tell by how they treated each other.",9,0,1,7 July 2005
28 Days Later...," Terribly realistic
","It's scary and suspenseful because of the situation they are in, but it isn't dead people walking around because of some voodoo, magic, or satanic karma nonsense; they have a disease, kind of like rabies, only much faster. This is the kind of thing that could actually happen. The movie follows one guy in his struggle to survive as he joins with others to form a small group. As the group gets bigger, the dynamics of the relationships these people have with each other become strained, and that's where the real story is. Our main guy stops running scared from the infected. He takes the offensive against the real bad guys who are other uninfected people. At least they're uninfected by the 'rage' virus, but they have some lustful desires that they are too eager to act out with unwilling women in the group. Now that makes for an interesting dynamic!",10,0,2,29 June 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Better than the first movie or the book
","The first movie was very different from the book, but it was still delightful because of Gene Wilder's lovable eccentricity. The songs in the first movie were wonderful, especially the two that Gene Wilder sang himself. It was a good movie, so why the remake?Tim Burton has outdone himself. This 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is not only his best work; it is better than the first movie. It's even better than the book. Every change it made from the book was an improvement, and there are several changes, including but not limited to: Shortening of the oompah-loompah songs so they give the same meaning without being so boring, the addition of many witty and comedic comments by Willy Wonka, much more dialog from the bedridden grandparents, and a completely different ending to the story. I won't spoil the new ending, but I'll tell you that I liked it very much, it made me cry, and I feel much better about things in general.I was always bothered by the first movie because Charlie and his grandpa had stolen the fizzy-lifting drinks and Grandpa Joe wanted to sell the everlasting gob-stopper to Slugworth. In this new version, Charlie Bucket is a true hero, the kind of kid any parent would want his kids to be. If you have children, you need to take them to this movie. The book is also great, but if you read the book to your kids first, they will be both surprised by and delighted with the movie.",10,3,7,18 July 2005
War of the Worlds," A big disappointment
","Spielberg shouldn't be allowed to make science fiction films. He managed to take parts of the book and parts of the old movie and add in enough of his own nonsense to make something far inferior to either. He took the crazy curator from the book, give him some of the ideas of the artilleryman and the name of the scientist killed in the beginning of the book to make the only really likable character in the movie, brilliantly played by Tim Robbins, who is deserving of another Oscar for this performance.Tom Cruise's character is a jerk who becomes even less likable throughout the movie; Dakota Fanning plays his screaming banshee daughter. They, with his very brave but equally stupid son, manage to survive to the end of this movie while everyone around them is being killed. There is no explanation how the son survived; I guess it was supposed to be a miracle. The real miracle is that so many other critics liked this movie that makes so little sense.The aliens come down in little spaceships in flashes of lightning. Why in the lighting? No plausible reason. They use their big tripod machines to destroy everything. The machines were put there millions of years ago to prepare for this invasion. Why didn't they have the invasion millions of years ago when they first put the machines here? I guess because Spielberg wasn't here to film it then. Why didn't the bacteria that kills them now kill them back when they buried these machines millions of years ago? How did they go these millions of years without finding out about bacteria? If they're millions of years advanced beyond our technology, why don't they have spacesuits the way we do? Why did Cruise's character's ex-wife ever marry him in the first place? I could spend the day asking questions about things that happened in this movie that don't make sense, but who would want to read that? If you haven't read the book, if you haven't seen the old movie, then maybe this movie is for you. The special effects are good, but don't look too closely or they won't make sense either (i.e. the monster coming up in the river, under the boat). Actually, Tim Robbins is the only reason I didn't rate this move a 1. His acting is really good.What made the old movie and the book both so good was that the story was believable; it was something that could actually happen. They also had some good protagonists that we could identify with and care about as they tried to survive the alien holocaust. This movie has neither of those. There are too many flaws. Too many people know things they would have no way of knowing. Too many people act in ways that people would not act. The special effect violate the laws of physics as well as common sense. This movie could easily have been so much better if Spielberg hadn't glammed it up to try to impress people with nastiness, the way he did with bugs and spiders in his lost ark movies. I was more than disappointed by it. It made me angry.",3,132,204,1 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Silly kid's movie or world-changing classic?
","From a scientific point of view, C3PO is as silly as you can get, from the way he looks and walks to the ridiculous things he says. He goes from berating his friend, R2D2, to worrying for his safety, from calling him incompetent to saying 'I knew you could do it' when R2 eventually saves them all. Aside from the incessant whining of Luke, who manages to be funny without having a sense of humor, we relate to him. We feel the frustration he feels when he is stuck on the farm, the pain he feels from the death of his aunt and uncle and later when he loses Ben Kenobi.The waving of blasters with flashes of light which are obviously added later, the terrible aim of anyone shooting at our main characters, and the big presentation of awards to our heroes at the end of the movie make me feel retarded for liking this film so much. But the pure goodness of the good guys (except for Han) makes me want them to win and makes me glad when they do. They're trying to save us all from the evil empire. Star Wars is so popular because most of us want to be the good guys, the ones who risk everything to do the right thing for the right reason and be appreciated by the people we save. This is the reason Spiderman was so enormously popular. He's just a kid who has some moral goodness, whom we can be proud of. Most of us would love to be Luke Skywalker.",10,4,5,29 June 2005
Fantastic Four," A bad Spiderman imitation
","Victor von Doom plays the Green Goblin, and our Fantastic Four play Spiderman, but in a sappy, silly way, without such good acting. The Thing was particularly annoying as he lost his temper faster than a two-year-old having a tantrum. The romantic interest between Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl is puzzling at best. The hot-shot flame-thrower dude is so conceited that, even though he is really funny, I still didn't like him. Reed Richards, Mr. Fantastic, is the only likable character in the movie, and the only one with any real acting ability. The basic story of the rich man losing his fortune, blaming it on the hero, and turning to evil is the same as Spiderman.This movie gets boring toward the end as we wait for our heroes to stop grumbling and fighting with each other and stop the bad guy. I loved the comic books as a kid and was really looking forward to this movie. It was disappointing for me, but I think your average preteen who has never seen the comics will enjoy it. They really should have had someone who knows something about science advise them; they got some of the science wrong as well.",4,1,3,14 July 2005
Cinderella Man," The best movie of the year so far
","I know some people can't fathom the depth of emotion this film can bring forth from viewers. Though the story is altered from the true story on which it is based, the main characters still show the pain inflicted by the depression. It shows the poverty that we think is so terrible, but is still rich compared with other nations. But mostly it shows the faith and courage that if we work hard and stick together and have integrity, opportunity will present itself. When someone poor works hard and finally has success, it is far more satisfying than success that has come easily. There is some great acting, not just by Russell Crowe, but by his trainer and his wife, and his little children. This is a great family film. I can't imagine why it would be rated 'R.' I would love to have my little children see it.",10,0,0,7 July 2005
Jurassic Park," Everybody likes dinosaurs
","I thought most of the characters in Jurassic Park were poorly directed. Especially when our two paleontologists first see the living dinosaurs and their jaws drop, I thought the acting was far too bad to blame on the actors. The only real good human acting by an adult in the movie was Jeff Goldblum's come-on to Laura Dern as he explained chaos theory to her. It was a little creepy, but it was brilliant acting. And of course, Malcolm turns out to be right. If I remember correctly, he was also quite brave when it came time to distract the T. Rex.Despite the generally bad acting, my fascination with dinosaurs, the special effects, and the general idea that they were the ancestors of the birds of today made this a wonderful story. Like most good movies, if you want a real treat, read the book. I would highly recommend it.",9,1,2,29 June 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A funny sort of comedy
","I am not a fan of country music, but I'm not sure that's what I would call what the soggy bottom boys sing. Though not realistic, the characters in this film are both likable and comical. I love the language they use. For example, after picking up a hitchhiker who has sold his soul to Satan and noting that his other companions had become 'saved' Everett comments that he is as of yet unaffiliated. Their odyssey leads them through some classical situations, but always with a humorous turn. Holly Hunter is Everett's beautiful but nagging wife, but his love for his daughters brings him back to the straight and narrow. Not only is the acting great, but the script is brilliant. The music is well-done and sometimes wonderful, especially at the baptism. If it had been rock and roll instead of country, I might have given it a 10.",7,0,0,1 July 2005
