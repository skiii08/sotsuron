The Equalizer," Hoping for better from Denzel
","I am a great fan of Denzel Washington and really wish he made more movies, but this one I didn't enjoy. Yes his performance was good; he always is but the movie was nothing but one scene of stylized violence after another. I enjoy bad guys getting there due as much as anyone but sometimes it's just a little too much and frankly just ridiculous. Here you have two intelligent people couldn't they find something more interesting to do with Nikolai and Robert but this. Again Hollywood suffers from really terrible storytelling. It seems the only good storytellers are Disney and Dreamworks. Maybe Denzel should consider doing an animated movie or some Indie movies instead of this junk. We know that they're going to do this story again I hope that somewhere there is a good writer that they can tap.",5,11,21,29 September 2014
Brave," So yes women are smarter
","Brave on the surface seemed like a wonderful trip to the mythical land Scotland. And that's the biggest problem with the movie, it isn't. Instead we get dumb kings, whiny daughter and very little magic. On the positive side Meridoc is a great animated character. And let me just say that the animation was the standout. Horses that look like real horses, bears that look like bears. Back to the story, yes it was female centric but was it necessary to make the men so completely dumb. We should not have to dummy others up to up lift ourselves. Also this was just a repeat of the little mermaid without the romance. The witch was a cute addition but the story was weak and frankly a little scary for little ones. Just one more note the animated short that appears before the movie is priceless. Too bad Brave wasn't.",7,1,5,26 June 2012
