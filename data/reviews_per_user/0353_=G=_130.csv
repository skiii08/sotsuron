The Legend of Bagger Vance," Uninspired perfection.
","'Bagger Vance' tells of a WWI hero (Damon) who loses his sterling golfing abilities because of unresolved war-related issues. With help from a 'Bagger Vance', a mysterious caddy (Smith), he's able to overcome his handicap. Typical Redford stuff, this film is pat, well crafted, and uninspired. Beautifully shot and with obvious attention to detail it follows all the rules of good Hollywood-style film making. However, the two male leads are miscast, the hero's epiphanies are corny and predictable, and the 'legend' part of the film is muddled with a lot of mumbo-jumbo about 'seeing the field' and 'play -your- game'. It's obvious the writers were not clear on what the 'rehab on the green' part of the film was about. An enjoyable watch for all, 'BV' should appeal most to golfers.",6,1,4,5 April 2001
Requiem for a Dream," A very over-rated disappointment.
","'Requiem...' tells of the downward spiral of several lives into a drug induced oblivion. A much over-rated non-story which won no major awards, this extrapolation of the 'Pi' mentality treads more in the the artsy-fartsy fringe than the mainstream offering an excellent performance by Burstyn, over done artistic effects, and little else. There are many better 'druggie' flicks with real stories to tell which don't make the viewer feel like a lookie-loo at a traffic accident.Because of it's overwrought creativity, which is more of a liability than an asset, 'Requiem...' is the critic's darling. However, it is too far from the mainstream to be a popular which probably accounts for the small space occupied on Blockbuster's shelves by the new release. Blockbuster -does- know their market. As for the high marks given by IMDB.com users, one can only speculate. However, there's no way this flick could possibly score an 8.7 of 10 (at this writing) given voting by a demographically typical cross-section of the population. Over half the votes a max score of 10....I don't think so.Recommended for those into art for art's sake films and younger adults who haven't seen this kind of kaleidoscopic visual creativity before.",6,7,31,23 May 2001
50 First Dates," Like an old car with a new Earl Scheib paint job.
","'50 First Dates' is about a brain-damaged woman (Barrymore) who has short term memory loss such that she wakes up every day unable to remember the previous day and therefore thinks every day is the same day. Such is the premise of this Hawaiian flavored flick in which the always deadpan Sandler grapples with the memory issue while trying to fall in love with a woman who greets him daily like a complete stranger. Add some kookie characters, some pretty Hawaiian scenery, a few cute marine animals, and some very ordinary music and you have one uninspired formula romcom which is nothing special but should be a pleasing time-passer for young adult females and Sandler and Barrymore fans.

Catch Me If You Can," How to get a job with the FBI
","'Catch Me If You Can' tells the story of Frank Abagnale, con man. With Spielberg in the director's chair and A-listers leading the way, you'd expect something a little better than this story about a kid who conned his way into jobs as a Pan Am pilot, a lawyer, a doctor, and into some serious money. Reasonably entertaining and well crafted, this film runs a tad long and is smeared with comedic overtones making it difficult to take seriously. It might have worked better as a serious rather than playful drama. Nonetheless, worth a look by anyone interested in stories about scamming. (B)Note - If you like this flick, you might want to check out Tony Curtis in 'The Great Imposter' (1961)",7,3,7,7 May 2003
Minority Report," Tinseltown chrome plated behemoth
","'Minority Report' busts some serious effects chops in this super tinselized megabuck sci-fi drama with wannabe actor Cruise doing his usual impossible mission stuff amidst a futuristic milieu where computers tap into the minds of a trio of 'precogs' soaking in a bathtub while visualizing the future where they can only see murders which the cops try to stop before they happen. A huge flick is you're into Hollyweird sci-fi blockbusters and a whole load of wasted money and effort if you're not, 'MR' has a weak human story, good action, and superb effects. Not quite a white elephant, 'Minority Report' runs a tad long and makes an good watch for wired types...like kids who drone on Nintendo all day. (B+)",8,2,6,18 December 2002
Training Day," Hardcore entertainment and blatant stupidity...that's Hollywood.
","In 'Training Day', a bloated Hollywood action/drama,  Hawke rides along with street narc Washington on his first day of on the job training as an undercover narcotics officer. The film tries to represent the tug of war between right and wrong in law enforcement on the mean streets of L.A. In spite of solid production value, the flick fails miserably to deliver a compelling story as it wears on and finally wears out with numbing excesses. An obvious fabrication full of characters who are marching to the beat of a director's crop, 'Training Day' has nothing to do with law enforcement and everything to do with Hollywood's exploitation of you and me. Nominal entertainment for those into crime flix.",6,2,21,19 March 2002
Friday Night Lights," Excellent bone crunching varsity football flick
","'Friday Night Lights' follows a season of football in a dusty little Texas oil town where varsity football is not just the only game in town but the only way out of town and the only hope for the future for many of the players. The film examines the team's key players and their good guy coach (Thornton) as they wrestle with personal issues and work their way through the season one bone jarring touchdown at a time. Working more with montages than linear plot development, Director Berg brings life and verve to the screen culminating in the mania and frenzy of the statewide championship. An excellent football flick, 'Friday Night Lights' is all about football and what it means to the town that lives through it vicariously. (B+)",7,1,3,21 January 2005
Erin Brockovich," A good all around flick. Entertaining. Enjoyable.
","'Erin Brockovich', with Julia Roberts in the title role, is a not-too-serious and entertaining film based on a true story. The film wisely spends much of it's time developing the Brockovich character; a very human but savvy divorcee with three kids, more brass than brains, more brains than education, and more education than taste in clothing. Laced with humor and avoiding melodrama, '...Brockovich' delivers laughs and tears, runs a tad long, and doesn't take itself too seriously. This film does what Hollywood does best. It entertains.",8,7,14,18 August 2000
Meet the Parents," Funny stuff with broad appeal.
","'Stiller', looking very much like 'Ted' from 'There's Something About Mary', is an 'almost fiancee' who has gone to spend the weekend with his girlfriend's parents. There he meets the future father-in-law from hell, played by De Niro. The film is a well assembled series of comic moments, with Stiller coming out on the short end of each, which builds from the almost normal early on to the utterly preposterous near the end. The director puts a bow on the flick by tidying up loose ends with a 'feel good' ending followed by a little kick. All in all the flick may be a small step down from '...Mary' for Stiller but is still quality comedy which will be enjoyed by most adults.",7,0,4,7 March 2001
Unbreakable," Paint an elephant blue and its still an elephant.
","A movie by Shyamalan is a movie by Shyamalan is a movie by Shyamalan. At least that's the trend which 'Unbreakable' would suggest. Another plodding and tedious bunch of Hollywood dark kinda paranormal stuff, this film manages to squeeze even less plot into its run time than its Shyamalan predecessor, 'The Sixth Sense'. But, hey, if you had a formula that worked and got $10 mil to do it again, you would too, huh? So, the moral to what is hopefully not a series of Shyamalan pseudo-paranormal spooky nonsense flicks is, I guess; if you liked 'The Sixth Sense', give 'Unbreakable' a try. If not, don't.",6,1,5,26 June 2001
Monster," A chick comes home to roost
","'Monster' comes at the story of notorious highway hooker and serial killer Aileen Carol Wuornos from a unique angle by developing a character who is so beat up by life, so failed by society, and so weakened by emotional pain that the only way she knows to sustain the shred of happiness she finds in an ill-wrought lesbian relationship is to seduce her victims by plying her trade and then killing them to get all of their money. Theron's Oscar winning and much lauded performance as Wuornos is first rate indeed but probably over-touted because of the rub-off from her physical metamorphosis and the intense drama of her situation thanks to the vision of the film's relatively obscure auteur Patty Jenkins. It is rare that a film engenders such compassion for a killer as does 'Monster' in a society which tends to simply lump all street whores, drug addicts, homeless people, etc. into the 'loser' category so they can be swept under the cultural carpet and forgotten. Kudos to Jenkins for this moving and disturbing look at the price of ignoring those most in need but too fractured to cry for help. (A-)",8,2,2,5 June 2004
Memento," Under hyped, over lauded, and damn good.
","'Memento' is a little, minimalistic drama, artistically and technically well done film, which has received accolades from all corners well beyond both budget and hype. A 'whodunit' of sorts with a curious premises, the film tells of an insurance investigator (Pearce) who suffers midterm memory loss and can't remember anything for more than 15 minutes. Pearce sets about find the killer of his wife, a difficult task for a normal investigator much less one with his 'condition'. The film's story is simple, the characters few, and there's no sex and little action or emoting going on. Rather the film focuses on the investigation with a clever one step forward, two steps backward flow and tortuous denouement which camouflages the many holes in the plot making for a compelling watch. Recommended for all adults into whodunits who want something to mentally chew on.",8,3,7,4 September 2001
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Captain Corelli's Floparoo
","'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' just can't seem to get its genres together as it stumbles from comedy to romantic-comedy to drama trying to be a sometimes funny and sometimes serious WWII love story. I thought Bale, Hurt, and Cruz nailed their parts and was surprised to see Cruz got a Razzie nom. Cage was...well, Cage was Cage. His Italian accent sucked but his lousy performance probably had no better directing than the rest of the film and nobody ever accused him of being an actor or artist anyway. Bottom line; the film delivers some pretty typical Hollywoodish entertainment with beautiful scenery, some action, some romance, etc. making an okay couch potato freebie but not recommended as a rental. (C+)",6,2,7,5 October 2002
12 Monkeys," Weirded out freak fest
","On the upside, 'Twelve Monkeys' pulls together a solid cast, a sort of Mad Max extrapolation milieu with lots of Rube Goldberg contraptions, a story which kinda/sorta makes sense, and weirdness heaped upon weirdness not to mention glowing reviews from critics and the public alike. On the downside, the flick tries too hard to be weird with tweaked color, tilts and angles, short lens closeups, fog, etc. and bunches of bizarre characters. A good flick for sci-fi junkies and people into weirdness for weirdnesses sake. Just be sure to turn off your brain before viewing to avoid numerous plot holes.",6,3,7,14 November 2001
The 13th Warrior," Poor man's 'Braveheart'
","Banderas plays the 13th warrior in this clumsy adventure flick about a bunch of badass Vikings who duke it out with the mysterious Wendol....yeah, right. The story is ill-conceived and poorly laid out with some dialogue shuffling in the beginning to get everyone speaking the same language. Fight sequences are tightly shot and poorly staged and overall the film is lackluster.  No sex or nudity...just a lot of blood & guts. Nonetheless, there is a certain masculine charm about the devil-may-care way the Vikings live to die which makes this worth watching if you need something to go with your popcorn.
Footnote: I was surprised by the number of user comments for this flick on IMDB.com. Prior to Tivo'ing it, I'd never heard of the movie and assumed it was one of those low budget losers. I must have missed the hype...the only reason so many could have written so much about so little.",6,4,12,28 December 2001
Shaun of the Dead," Kevin Smith lite
","Shaun of the Dead' is a Brit flick comedy romp which gaggles together a motley bunch of stereotypical young adults including a klutzy schmuck (the hero), his babe girlfriend, the required gross fat guy sidekick, etc. and then plunks them down in the middle of a zombie flick. The film conjures a mix of droll and outrageous humor which wears thin quickly and then turns into a bloody Zombiefest which seems as endless as it is pointless. With few lol's to offer but the same sort of obvious tailoring for the irreverent and unsophisticated young adult crowd as a Kevin Smith (Dogma, Mallrats, etc.) flick, 'Shaun of the Dead' manages to clunk along with good production value, a meager story, and some cult appeal. (B-)",6,2,7,24 December 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The worst pirate movie ever.
","Just kidding. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' is an extravagant and sumptuous feast albeit an awful lot of talking...and we all know pirates were long on plunder and short on words. It's politically correct Disney all the way with this watered down and convoluted family fun fare which has delighted the critics and public alike. However, there was no black eye patch, no peg leg, no hanging from a yard arm, no pieces of eight or dubloons, and its common knowledge that planks were always walked blindfolded which was a big part of pirate fun. Also, what's up with sword fighting someone you can't kill? Good stuff even if it was an encyclopedia version pirating as opposed to the more real good ol' Hollywood version of the buccaneer. (B+)",8,5,11,3 December 2003
The English Patient," A lot to swallow
","'The English Patient' is by all accounts a huge movie which has received so much commentary over the past 7 years that there's little point in contributing to the noise. The problem I had with the film was simply it wasn't believable. Everyone in this film does extraordinary and incredibly stupid things, all in the name of force feeding you the film's melodrama. Good in all respect save perhaps it's length and difficult buy-in (I kept wishing he'd just die and get it over with) 'The English Patient' has been carefully tweaked to make it easy to swallow. So, if you haven't seen the film yet, be prepared to have to chug-a-lug a whole lot of movie for only a moderate payoff. (B)",7,5,12,15 November 2003
Bloody Sunday," A reenactment
","'Bloody Sunday' tells of a peaceful 1972 protest march in Northern  Ireland which clashed with British military forces resulting in 13 dead and as many wounded. The film is an excellent and very busy  reenactment with all the jiggle-cam, awkward angles, and other treatments designed to give it the feel of a documentary. However, it offers little story arc, character development, side plots, conventional entertainment value, etc.  In the grand scheme of docudramas, 'Bloody Sunday' pales before a panoply of historical accounts of military/civillian conflicts. Recommended only for those with particular interest in Derry, Ireland circa 1/30/1972. (C+)",6,2,8,24 April 2003
Elizabeth," The making of a queen
","'Elizabeth' is a ravishing, sumptuous, and very Hollywoodish telling of the early years of Elizabeth I who inherited a broken England at age 25, secured her tenuous grasp on the throne amidst treachery from all corners, consolidated her monarchy to become one of history's most notable rulers, and sowed the seeds which sprouted into a prosperous global empire. Praised by public and critics alike with a brace of awards as testament to its value, 'Elizabeth: The Virgin Queen' sports a fine cast, offers high end production value, and has little to fault for those who don't mind an infusion of creativity with their history. Good stuff for fans of the players and those interested in the history of the British monarchy. (B+)",8,2,3,6 December 2003
The Girl Next Door," A movie only a teenager could love
","'The Girl Next Door' is one long series of excuses for serving up huge helpings of sex in an apparent attempt to separate the tween/teen male from the price of admission. This very unromantic lol free comedy tells of an about-to-grad HS student body prez who falls for the house sitting babe next door and then learns she's a porn star and sets about to save her from herself so she can be the person she really wants to be. (Ahem) Hirsch makes a suitable centerpiece while Cuthbert provides the babe-a-licious eye candy as this lame comedy only a teen could love kerchunks though huge gulps of sex obsessed filler. Scoffed at by the critics with poor marks from mature adults, this flick is fodder for teens chock full of shameful subliminals, T&A, and sex talk. A guaranteed winner for teen males and their bimbos and a loser for all others. (C)",5,1,6,25 August 2004
Billy Elliot," Brit flick goes Hollywood and wins kudos.
","The much lauded and nominated film 'Billy Elliott' is a slice of life flick about an 11 year old English boy who, to the dismay of his motherless working class coal mining family, chooses ballet over boxing as a pastime. The film is technically excellent, artistically well done, and follows the traditions of Hollywood film-making. The story is a pleasant mix of humor and pathos, not too deep, and palatable enough to make it an audience favorite. In addition to being just plain fun to watch, 'BE' makes a few points about accepting people for who they are; about the undeniability of innate passion by artists; and about the sublimation of aggression through dance. Not a classic and somewhat over rated, the simple numbers prove 'BE' is a box office favorite and an enjoyable watch for most. Kudos to the choreographer and Bell for some fun to watch and never seen before kookie, kid-like mixes of jazz, tap, ballet, and jigs.",8,1,1,18 April 2001
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Romcom by rote
","'How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days' is a little bit of contempo fluff for the 13-24 demographic which bets heavily on the popularity of the two protags, Hudson and McConaughey. The flick's premise has a built in problem as it requires both protags to act uncharacteristically during most of the run thereby making the superficial character development even more superficial. Sorely lacking the creative department and with nothing going for it save Hudson's over-worked smile and McConaughey's overworked suavity, there's little to praise in this very average romcom which is sure to make broadcast in a heartbeat. (C+)",5,5,8,3 July 2003
Alexander," What a waste
","Stone's 'Alexander' tries to tell the story of one of the great military leaders and conquerors of all time who is to this day, some 2300 years later, is still studied in military war colleges. Unfortunately the film tries too hard to do too much resulting in three hours of jumping around in time trying desperately to show us the man and his human story while carrying on great expeditionary campaigns at the same time. With insufficient didactics, overzealous theatrics, and the esoterics of the time, the film becomes nothing less than a numbing mess. Listening to Stone's director's cut one gets the impression he had a clear vision of what he wanted to accomplish with his well researched historical epic. One also gets the impression he made the movie for himself. Lacking in coherence, muddled and messy, 'Alexander' is a classic example of what happens when one ventures too deep into that creative territory where less is more resulting in a spectacular flop. (C+)",6,0,1,4 August 2005
The Others," Just more stuff going bump.
","Kidman gets a workout in 'The Others', a classy nonstory about a woman and her two children living in a haunted house...etc. etc. etc. The film is little more than Kidman running around emoting, gasping, screaming, etc. etc. etc. A well crafted spook movie, this to-viedo-in-a-heartbeat flick with almost a dozen producers fails to deliver anything new, lacks the creative edge of 'The Sixth Sense',  and comes off like a spotlight production for Kidman and little more.  A must see for Kidman fans and ghostaholics and a tedious watch for others.",6,2,7,16 May 2002
Insomnia," Good stuff in spite of being flawed and over-hyped.
","'Insomnia 2002' tells a tortuous tale about a top cop from L.A. (Pacino) who travels to Alaska to help with a homicide investigation while being investigated by I.A. at home. Unable to sleep under the midnight sun, he begins to unravel as he digs deeper into the crime and becomes a reluctant partner to his quarry. A slick shoot with excellent acting and good auteursmanship by 'Memento' director Nolan, 'Insomnia 2002' is not without its plotholes. An over-hyped drama and not a murder mystery, this flick has little action, no sex/nudity, few moments of thrills and/or suspense, and characters who are not likely to engender empathy. Solid dramatic entertainment worth a look nonetheless. (B+)",8,0,2,16 October 2002
X-Men," A special effects orgy with an ordinary story.
","A sci-fi action fantasy, 'X-Men' squanders an excellent cast, powerful camera and sound work, and a visual feast of special effects on a flimsy and sometimes silly good-mutant vs. bad-mutant story. This film will play best with young Nintendo geek gamer-types and worst with mature audiences who may tire of trying to remember which mutant has what power which can thwart what mutant with which power...etc, blaa, blaa. Open ended and with a mission unanswered, there's plenty of sequel room.",6,1,5,22 November 2000
Children of Heaven," A beautiful film about childhood sibling love.
","'Children of Heaven' looks at a poor Iranian boy (9)and his quest to be responsible and deserving of the love of his sister (6) by replacing her shoes which he has lost. Demonstrating that less is often more, this sweet film speaks volumes with simple actions, thoughts, and feelings.God bless the child who's got his own.",8,1,1,13 August 2000
Hotel Rwanda," Rwanda's Schindler
","'Hotel Rwanda' is a docudrama which tells the true story of a hotel manager (Cheadle) who, at his own peril, provided safe haven and protection for about 1000 refugees fleeing the Rwandan genocide of 1994 when 800,000 people were killed in a three month civil war. As is often the case with films which are built around compelling subjects such as holocausts, the import of the subject rubs off on the film elevating it's importance. Such is the case with 'Hotel Rwanda', which is well crafted though it offers nothing new, conforms to the Hollywood playbook, and is probably slightly over-touted. The film spares the audience much of the bloody horror of the genocide with its PG-13 rating while doing a good job of building suspense and imparting a sense of the magnitude of the slaughter of innocents. Didactics are worked into the story so it is not difficult to follow even though the good and bad people are all black Rwandans. Those interested in the 1994 Rwandan genocide might also want to check out 'Sometimes in April', a 2005 TV drama about the genocide which offers a somewhat broader perspective. (B)",7,5,8,14 April 2005
We Were Soldiers," The harsh reality of Hollywood.
","Many good films have been made about the American/Vietnamese conflict from the sensationalistic and unpretentious 'Apocalypse Now' to many serious minded documentaries about the harsh reality of the war. 'We Were Soldiers' is not one of them. A pretentious retelling of the first major American engagement with the Vietnamese on the battlefield (circa 1965), the film is one contrived, obvious, and fabricated scene after another from crying because you lived and your men  didn't (a success for a field commander) to coming home unannounced (yeah, right) to a feeble attempt to honor the Vietnamese warriors, etc. etc. etc. This flick is blatant commercialism under the guise of patriotism and a poor tribute to the fighting men and women who sacrificed during the Vietnam conflict. The only thing sadder than the mentality behind 'We Were Soldiers' is the mentality that supported it at the box office and in critical reviews. (C-)",4,28,54,20 August 2002
Ocean's Twelve," Whadda mess!
","'Ocean's Twelve' wastes a stellar cast and great locations on a poor follow up to 'Ocean's Eleven' (2001). A step down for Soderbergh, this film is another caper flick which finds Danny Ocean (Clooney) reassembling his crew for another heist to pay off the debt due from the previous film's heist. In this convoluted mess, our hero not only has to outwit the police but also pit himself against the world's greatest thief. A messy conglomeration of the same elements which made the 2001 flick entertaining, 'Ocean's Twelve' simply tries too hard to do too much with too little time resulting a bad case of sequelitis. Only for those who went nuts over the first film, this flick is best saved for a freebee TV watch. (B-)",6,0,2,18 April 2005
Snatch," Just more Ritchie.
","A knock-off of the successful but obnoxious 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels' undoubtedly designed to milk young and adoring Ritchie junkies of all they're worth, 'Snatch' is another inelegant, unsophisticated, herky-jerky claptrap flick loaded cockamamie cockney comic book characters caught up in a monotonous droning buzz of a numbing nonstory. A waste of time and money for all but those movie masochists who enjoyed 'Lock, Stock...'.",6,1,5,4 July 2001
The Beach," A must-see for DiCaprio fans and an enjoyable no-brainer for all others.
","This DiCaprio tour-de-force focuses on the misadventures of a rebellious young tourist in Thailand. The superficial saga takes the charismatic DiCaprio to a tropical island paradise and a commune of young hedonists. The film would have us believe his experiences are an exercise in self discovery. However, the thin and disjointed plot doesn't manage to conjure up anything sufficiently profound and we're left with a string of fabrications and a feeling that our hero would have been better off staying home and playing video games.",6,1,5,28 July 2000
Final Destination 2," Mo of da same
","Death has a list. And if you're on the list, you're going to die in the order in which you appear on the list. Of course, if someone doesn't die on schedule that creates a ripple in death's plan and if a child is born to a mother who was scheduled to die then someone on the list may be allowed to live...I think. Anyhoo, that's probably all wrong but you're not going to care about the plot anyway as you watch this sequel to 'Final Destination 1' in which a coed hooks up with a cop and a throwback from the original flick to thwart death's master plan. Though the film lacks in cohesion and sensibility, it is chock full of cause-effect chain reactions which result in a stuntfest and grisly actions sequences throughout. Probably a tad less than the original (which isn't bad for a sequel), FD2 is a worthwhile watch for anyone into gory horror action dramas made with the old teen and young adult crowd in mind.

Blade II," Where's Buffy when you need her?
","The B-Man is back slicing and dicing legions of a new breed of suckpuppies in an orgy of special effects which makes the original 'Blade' pale by comparison. Hardcore horrific action from start to finish with a smattering of plot, a ton of silly putty, and a thousand gallons of red Kool-aid, 'Blade 2' is a must see for those who enjoyed the original 'Blade'.

The Doors," For Doors fans only
","Oliver Stone's 'The Doors' tells of the rise to demise of Jim Morrison, lead for the title rock band, icon of the hippy culture, and celebrated/notorious/controversial rock musician. The film focuses on Morrison's brief six year career and features a fine performance by Kilmer, much of 'The Doors' music, and plenty of Hollywood sensationalism. I watched the film as a matter of curiosity since I lived through the period but never really knew who Morrison was (which pretty much makes me no expert) and found myself doing a lot of fast forwarding through the music and concerts. Unfortunately, Morrison wasn't all that interesting making the film of questionable value to anyone who was not a 'Doors' or Morrison fan. B-",6,3,9,4 July 2002
Closer," Classy tripe
","'Closer' is a pretentious dialog-intensive ensemble drama which examines the flux of the crisscrossing relationships which exist between the four players (Law, Portman, Roberts, and Owen). An unfortunate and obvious concoction which requires audience suspension of belief for the shabbiest of reasons, this nihilistic feel-bad flick goes nowhere as it sinks deeper and deeper into the hollowness of the characters it sticks in our face. A well managed production with a good cast and good direction which fails in writing, 'Closer' is a very forgettable waste of time when compared with the panoply of better ensemble dramas to be had. The shallow characters behave only as do characters in shallow films as they try to suck emotion from the most feeble foibles leaving the audience feeling much like one who has just been had by Hollywood again. For those who live for the sham of Hollywood filmdom, this film may rank worthy. For those who love cinema at it finest, 'Closer' will sink into the morass of failed film sludge.

Lost in Translation," A mirror of nuances
","'Lost in Translation' is by all accounts a huge film. Telling of a 50-something married man (Murray) and a 20ish married woman (Johansson) - both Americans stuck in a hotel in Tokyo with too much time on their hands - who come together to soothe the yearning they both have for companionship, 'Lost....' is a sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, and always sensitive look at the importance of being human. Masterfully struck from little more than nuances with slick art and technicals, this Coppola coup will tell you more about who you are than about the two principals. 'Lost in Translation' will speak most loudly to anyone who has ever experienced the love which could never be. (A)",9,4,10,3 February 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," For the ladies and the men who love them...just the way they are.
","'Bridget Jones's Diary' tells of a single thirtyish English office worker (Zellweger) who is plumpish, klutzy, and unsure of herself but dauntlessly playing the mating game in spite of her imperfections. A sort of 'Rocky' for single women, 'Bridget...' gets off to a quick start and keeps the entertainment coming nonstop all the way to its delightful conclusion. Charming and laced with wry British wit, this film out of the UK is a laugh/cry feel good flick for ladies and the men who love them...just the way they are.",7,0,1,10 October 2001
10 Things I Hate About You," A film only a bop could love
","'10 Things...' is a typical teen campus romantic comedy romp with the usual bunch of slightly older than teen stars, a thin plot (forget Shakespeare), and envelope pushing on sex innuendos required to separate the kids from the price of admission. The flick has a lively script, a bit of 'tude', and a few good moments but lacks the sophistication and insight of the trend setting John Hughes films. Not showing us anything new, '10 Things...' is an ok diversion for the high school crowd which will probably be only marginally entertaining for adults.",6,0,2,29 September 2001
Predator," See Arnold flex. See things go boom.
","'Predator' lacks just about everything that ever made Arnold's bigger-than-life-hero action flicks good. Nonetheless, it tries to follow the same formula using a creature from outer space for the nemesis. How this thing got a 7+ from IMDB.com users, I'll never know. So, forget me, turn off your brain, and catch this on the cable merry-go-round sometime. Pure escapist action stuff in the jungle minus one ingredient all action flicks should have...a lusty, busty babe.",6,1,12,15 January 2002
American Pie," A raunch rage of sappy humor...
","...'American Pie' is a ridiculous and vulgar High School coming-of-sexual-age comedy. A pathetic cinematic endeavor, this senseless string of vacuous gags and situations is not for the jaded or sophisticated and will play best in frat houses and college dorms or to audiences with a similarly unfettered sense of humor. The number of shelves the video occupies at Blockbuster is a reminder that 'popular' is often synonymous with 'mediocre'.",5,0,3,7 August 2000
The Bourne Identity," Just so much bizziness.
","'The Bourne Identity' is a typical Hollywired megabuck  supertinselized by-the-numbers mechanical overhyped product which tells its tale of an amnesiac superspy guy (Damon) who has to find out who he is while trying to woo a babe and avoid a bunch of assassins and assorted cops, etc. out to get him. This very busy film does nothing to distinguish itself; has no soul or personality and very little heart; is one contrived scene after another; borders on sci-fi with too much unreal techno-junk; and takes itself much too seriously.  If you listen to the music you'll get a sense of import which far exceeds the on-screen nonsense. On the up side, however, the film sports a good cosmopolitan cast, features good locations and technicals, and is slick and polished with enough style to be an entertaining no-brainer for action junkies. (B-)Note - It was nice seeing Stiles keeping her mouth shut, Potente standing still, Cox speaking with an American accent, and Cooper in a lead role in a major flick.",7,2,4,22 January 2003
The Italian Job," Junk food for the tween mind
","'The Italian Job' (2003), a commercial product after the tween/teen buck, is an uninspired action flick with a very soft PG-13 rating and a simple-minded make-it-up-as-you-go plot about a bunch of thieves (the good guys) who are after 7 tons of gold and another thief (the bad guy). A mindless mess of Hollywood action busyness, this flick might have been worth watching if any of the stunts or chases or techno-babble had been new, creative, or unique. However, this turkey is just more of the same-o same-o we've all seen before sprinkled with some contempo buzz words in a new wrapper. No matter how you slice it, this time-waster is just more cinematic junk food and market clutter. (C)",5,1,2,7 October 2003
Radio," Heartwarmer
","'Radio' is a fictional fact-based account of the relationship which develops between a South Carolina small town high school athletic director (Harris) and a mentally challenged black man (Gooding). There's little going on in this sweetly sentimental film which juxtaposes campus life and football with family life and one man's life altering experience through a very rewarding though unlikely friendship. Oscar winner Gooding earned a Razzie nom for his portrayal while the critics pounded the film for it's sappy cornball approach to story telling and Gooding's exaggeration of his character. Nonetheless, the film earned respectable marks from the paying public who were touched by the heartwarming tale of a different kind of relationship. For sentimentalists only. (B)",7,0,2,1 April 2004
Cast Away," And that's why I use UPS! (Spoilers ahead)
","'Cast Away' is an over-touted, over-wrought, commercial flick with Hollywood written all over it. The flick is obvious in the way it sets about to attract audiences with million dollar names and hype, push audience buttons with the perfect little romance front end and the soapy back end right down to the highly improbable delivery of one Fed Ex package which he (Hanks the castaway) refused to open even though it could have contained food, antibiotics, batteries, etc...duh. A formula flick made for mass appeal, 'Cast Away' again proves that the Hollywood formula works and no-brainer entertainment rules the day.",7,2,4,13 June 2001
Pitch Black," Gritty sci-fi. Weak on 'sci', okay on 'fi'.
",Except for some running around looking for power cells there's little of the usual sci-fi technoprops in this A- flick about a motley bunch of space travelers stranded on a planet inhabited by flock of man eating Raptors. The film focuses on the characters and their predicament and would be little more than an ordinary action/horror flick set in an earthly desert were it not for an interesting character played by Vin Diesel. Okay for sci-fi addicts and Diesel fans. Others may find it a low budget disappointment.,5,0,1,13 October 2000
Cold Mountain," Not all that
","A kind of poor man's 'Gone With the Wind', 'Cold Mountain' tells of a man (Law) who falls in like with a woman (Kidman) but has to go off to fight for the CSA during the American Civil War. After the battle of Petersburg in late 1864, he deserts and spends the bulk of the 2.5 hour film humping it back home to his kinda-sorta beloved all the while bumping into all manner of peculiar hillbilly characters while Kidman does a sort of Scarlett O'Hara thing trying to maintain a stiff upper lip in the face of cold and deprivation and never having had to do labor before. 'Cold Mountain' is a worthy albeit Hollywoodized star power and hype film about star crossed would-be lover hillbillies who struggle with the tribulations of the time. The film suffers from a thin plot with a story which is filled with side characters who contribute little to the plot and a denouement which is predictable and too little too late. Don't expect to be seeing much of bit parters Hoffman, Ribisi, Portman, or Sutherland in this long wannabe epic which fared well with critics and public alike and garnered a respectable brace of awards. (B)",7,3,9,30 June 2004
American Psycho," A good but pointless misanthropic dark satire.
","Perhaps the real value to 'American Psycho' is the fodder it will provide for film critics and pedantic cinematic devotees.

However, the general film-going public will likely find it ambiguous, pointless, grotesque, and lacking the entertainment value of the real American 'Psycho' by Hitchcock.",7,3,9,5 September 2000

","Arnie's back as the machine with the Austrian accent and this time he's programmed to be a good bot who has to take on a later model bad girl babebot, T-X, who is slimmer, cuter, and can kick his butt. With wall to wall state-of-the-art effects, T3 wreaks death and destruction from beginning to end while Stahl and Danes run around looking for the plot which seems to be buried somewhere in technobabble and rubble. Good stuff for CGI fanatics and Terminites. All others stay away. (B-)",6,4,9,13 November 2003
U-571," A so-so no brainer adventure/suspense flick about U-Boats
","'U-571' has a good cast, is reasonably entertaining, and manages to generate some suspense though the creaking hull and spraying water pipes do get old after awhile.

","In 'I, Robot', Will Smith is a cop with a sense of humor and a grudge against robots in the year 2030 something when humanoid robots are everywhere thanks to a giant corporation in a giant building in Chicago which manufactures friendly, helpful robots who have been programmed to protect humans. Sent to investigate the apparent suicide of the genius who created the robots, Smith uncovers an insidious plot - which will pit robots against people in an apocalyptic culmination of action, CGI and effects - and must save the token babe and the world from the big bot revolution. Short on human story, this sci-fi action/dramady hyperkinetic mech-fest pushes the envelope of believability with its overwrought CGI. Worth a look for sci-fi and CGI junkies.

Save the Last Dance," Mediocre teen flick
","'Save the Last Dance' is an ill focused teen drama about a white high school girl who moves into a black ghetto after her mother dies. There she is awakened by her love interest and inspired to be all she can be and realize her dream. This wandering, simple-minded slice of life flick doesn't show us anything new and does a poor job of showing us old stuff. 'Save...' fails as a love story, a dance flick for either hip-hop or ballet, and doesn't even make a convincing drama. Most likely to be appreciated by teen females but not recommended for anyone.",4,1,3,20 June 2001
Collateral," One night in L.A.
","In 'Collateral', an icy contract killer (Cruise) hijacks a cabbie (Foxx) who he forces to drive him around L.A. while he makes his stops to take care of business. The film neatly knits a scant human story including a babe and some cops with action, drama, suspense, and intrigues into an engrossing if not spellbinding two hour tale. When all is said and done, this taut action/drama ties up all loose ends including the question: Why would a hit-man hire a cabbie to drive him around L.A. instead of renting a car thereby eliminating the hostage/witness problem? And, although 'Collateral' doesn't break any new ground and does follow the Hollywood play-book to the letter, it is sufficiently intelligent, busy, unpredictable, and entertaining to be a worthwhile watch for anyone into cop/killer flix.

The Machinist," Reminded me of 'Memento'
","'The Machinist' is a dark drama all about an unrecognizable Bale as a gaunt machinist who hasn't slept in a year and looks to be a sandwich away from the grave as we observe his daily activities which invariably include some peculiar and irreconcilable events. The film opens with the protagonist dumping a corpse and then flashes back where it spends the rest of the run working it's way back to it beginning in a series of interesting if not compelling and strange if not unsettling happenings. As the film wears on we get the notion it is either a well done work which is trying to get us to empathize with a likable but delusional man or a shoddy film which is trying to delve into the realm of the paranormal. Fortunately, it's the former and a solid watch for drama enthusiasts who like curious plots (ala 'Memento') with protagonists who are suffering from them. (B+)",8,2,9,10 July 2005
The Fast and the Furious," Kid stuff for gearheads
","'The Fast and Furious', adapted from a magazine article, could have been adapted from a comic book. With a simple minded plot,  some pretty awful acting by just about everyone (Diesel excepted), and the usual Hollywood excesses pushing the PG-13 envelope, 'The Fast...' gets off on high octane street racing.

The Commitments," Like soul?
","You'd better like soul music if you're planning on watching 'The Commitments'. The film is all about a young Dublin man who decides to assemble a rock band from his local cohorts and friends and that's all the film is about. From beginning to end, this raucous comedy tells of the coming together of a motley crew of musicians and wannabees who manage to harmonize on stage while dissonance prevails off stage. A raucous and ebullient musical  comedy which is more lively than sophisticated and more profane than profound, this assembly of first-time acting talent is a must see for anyone into that Motown sound. All others, beware. (B)",7,2,6,15 March 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Unadulterared crap
","'Unadulterated' as in not made for adults, 'Butterfly Effect' offers some marginal performances in a silly make-it-up-as-you-go story which seems to be little more than an excuse to serve up huge helpings of gratuitous garbage for titillation of the those young people Hollywood just loves to rip off. You'll see a pedophilia, animal cruelty, sex, nudity, frat hazing, car trashing, prison fights, insane ravings, countless excuses to use the ever popular 'F' word, and much, much more cinematic junk food designed to separate the old teen and young adult audience from the price of admission as this sensationalistic crap-filled flick wanders through the deranged mind of the central character (Kutcher). Scorned by the critics but hailed by young males, 'Butterfly Effect' is not worthy of a recommendation. (C)",5,10,33,7 July 2004
Tigerland," Okay but ill focused with no real story
","A kind of slice-of-Army-grunt-life film, 'Tigerland' tells of recruits in boot training in preparation for duty in Vietnam. An earnest endeavor, this film offers some good performances and maintains a flawed but generally realistic representation of basic training with the focus on one platoon and one man in particular. Unfortunately the film gets mired in a morass of negatives forsaking the positives, duty, honor, and courage, with no clear purpose, a nebulous plot, and a screenplay which quickly becomes a burr of macho vulgarities and one big cluser-f**k. Most likely to be appreciated by soldier-type mentalities.",5,1,5,1 September 2001

","'Remember the Titans' tells about a black football coach (Washington) who transfers to an integrated high school where he's faced with turning black and white prejudices into teamwork and winning the state championship with a racially mixed team in a racially divided society. On the downside, 'Titans' shows us nothing new, runs too long, gets too busy and is a journeyman production at best. On the upside, the film turns black and white issues into appropriate shades of gray, delivers lots of grid iron action, and waxes to a Rockyesque 'feel good' conclusion. The fact that females scored this football flick higher (on IMDB.com) than males is telling.",7,17,35,21 March 2001

The Chorus," Pleasant and enjoyable
","'The Chorus' is a subtitled French film about a portly, mild mannered teacher who takes a job at a marginalized boy's school and finding his young students to be unruly and disruptive he sets about to sublimate their behavior by organizing them into a choir. A sweetly sentimental tale with a Disneyesque feel, 'The Chorus' plods along predictably in flashback and winds up quickly with a somewhat anticlimactic conclusion. A very pleasant, well crafted, and even-tempered film with some lovely choir music, 'The Chorus' is a bit corny but should be a pleasing watch for sentimentalists and others interested in simple and heart warming film fare. (B)",7,2,4,6 May 2005
The Pianist," Music was his passion. Survival was his instinct.
","'The Pianist' is doubtless well crafted and technically and artistically sound albeit naive and conventional. The film parses into one hour of a stereotypical and exploitive regurgitation of the horrors of the Nazi reign over the Warsaw ghetto, where every German soldier is more evil than Satan and every Jew a pathetic victim, and one hour of Brody living like a rat foraging for sustenance amid the Warsaw ruination. Only in the very end does the film introduce a bit of irony and a sympathetic Nazi after countless missed opportunities to breath something fresh into what is just another in a very long list of films about the infamous ghetto (Families torn apart, summary executions, etc.).  Brody delivers a fine performance as a pianist and the film's centerpiece but is not required to perform the range of emotion deserving of a little gold statuette. Overall, the film is worthwhile but shows us nothing new and exploits rather than honors the memory of those Polish Jews who died in the conflict. 'The Pianist' will play best with those who have not yet had their fill of Warsaw ghetto films. (B)",7,2,4,29 May 2003

","'The Transporter' tells of an Brit ex-Army macho mercenary driver-for-hire in the South of France who will deliver whatever wherever with no questions asked and gets embroiled in a thrill a minute escapade when one of his packages turns out to be a passenger. An obvious and predictable formula action flick with some okay stunts, firefights, thrill rides, and even a little sky and scuba diving, 'The Transporter' is just a good old fashioned machoduck not-to-be-taken-seriously funfest with all the requisite titillators except T&A, sex, and nudity. For action junkies only. (B)",7,2,5,3 November 2003
28 Days Later...," Not a sequel to Bullock's '28 Days'.
","'28 Day Later' tells of a trio of people who survive a raging plague which turns infected people into blood-thirsty maniacs who in turn infect others, etc. The problem confronting our group in this post apocalyptic type sci-fi/horror hybrid is: How do we stay alive, discover other survivors, and perpetuate the human race. On the upside, the flick is well done in a smart and gritty style, only has one dream sequence, and doesn't throw cheap shots at you. On the downside, it asks more questions than it answers, neglects the human story in deference to logistics and action, and is lacking big budget Hollywoodish extras. An okay watch for those into this kind of flick. (B-)",6,1,14,22 October 2003
City of God," Disappointing
","'City of God' is an old story. So old, in fact, it begins in the 60's as it tells of gangsters in a Rio de Janeiro slum who do what gangsters do and have done everywhere for all the same reasons. Poverty breeds ignorance which breeds hopelessness which breeds desperation which breeds crime...etc. This film shows us nothing new, save the location and its paper thin characters, as it takes the audience into a slew of favela-dwelling punks with guns (so many it's hard to keep track of who's who and who killed who for what reason) as it attempts to impart a sense of warring in the Rio ghetto. You'll see such a convoluted mess of gang bangers there's no time for the film to provide character depth or a sense of the gangster ethos or the mechanics of the drug trade or a reason to care who lives or dies, etc. Just a whole lot of killing with numbing excess and only a hint of a human story. For reasons I am unable to deduce, 'City of God' received raves from all corners and countless awards and noms. Go freakin' figure! Personally, I found the documentary piggy-backed into the DVD more interesting than the film and the one scene from the film I remember most (it was shown twice) was that of a chicken which was run over by a truck but escaped unscathed. If you like your street punk killing flicks with subtitles, go for it. (C+)",5,19,45,10 June 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Bruce Lee meets Peter Pan
","More than enough has been written about this flick. However, it may be worthwhile to point out that the film has an obvious Eastern flavor to it...a tendency to be melodramatic, surreal, hopelessly romantic, and undubbed. Westerners may have trouble getting into the story of this fantasy/action/drama/travelogue. Personally, I was not impressed though there is great beauty in the film. Nonetheless, at #14 in IMDB's top 250 list (as of this date), it's a safe flick to recommend as watching it is almost a prerequisite to claiming to be a film buff.",8,0,4,6 June 2001

","'Hero' is by all accounts a very big if not huge movie with plaudits aplenty from critics and public. The film tells a sort of epic adventure fairy tale about an assassin (Jet Li) and a handful of cohorts who conspire to kill a king which is high melodrama Chinese style and not likely to have a great appeal to westerners. What sets 'Hero' apart from most other martial art films is the spectacular locations, sets, costumes, music, CGI, and state-of-the-art production value.

","'No Man's Land' is a satirical representation of the futility of the Bosnian/Serb conflict which uses one incident, a living man in a trench booby-trapped with a land mine, to show how the people involved, from foot soldiers to media to UN peace-keepeers to the chain of command, all fail to succeed when hatreds run deep. In other words, the film shows what a freakin 'clusterf**k' the war was.

","The first 30 minutes of 'K19: The Widowmaker' are spent introducing the characters and setting up the story. The next 30 minutes are spent with an uneventful sub shakedown. The film doesn't even begin to get into what it's all about, the China Syndrome nuke problem, until the 100 minute mark. Given the slow start, obvious filler, and the fact that we all know how this not-so-thrilling thriller turns out, the film boils down to just so much busy-work, sub talk, scurrying around, watching gauges, etc. With the absence characters we're given to care about, there's little reason to recommend this white elephant.

'Pi' - a creative, low budget, award winning independent flick shot in black and white on grainy/contrasty film - is moody, frenetic, idiosyncratic, cerebral and not for everyone.

","'Garden State' is all about a young man from Hollywood who returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral where he rekindles old friendships, attempts to straighten out his relationship with his father, and falls in love. A one man indie by Zack Braff, 'Garden State' has few of the telltale indie liabilities as it develops its linear make-it-up-as-you-go story with freshness, warmth, and humor. On the upside, this film about one man's honest approach to life is a pleasing blend of quirky humor, poignant moments, and contemporary romance. On the downside, the film is skewed toward younger audiences, lacks the tinsel which the big bucks buy, and has a scene-to-scene sameness which comes from it's single-minded auteursmanship. Although one cannot expect the output of one man not even 30 years of age to result in an exceptional product, this little film received acceptable critical nods and excellent marks from the public making is a worthwhile watch for Gen-Yers and just about anyone into contemporary quirky romantic comedy fare.

Donnie Brasco," Not bad, not great.
","'Donnie Brasco' tells of an FBI agent (Depp) who infiltrates a NYC mob crew where his allegiance is tested by his growing affection for his aging wiseguy mentor (Pacino) to the dismay of his wife (Heche). The film is chock full of stereotypes with the same old character actor faces we've seen playing mob types before and lacks the grit or edge one would expect of a crime flick based on a true story. The film's matter-of-fact approach to life in the mob keeps emotions in tow with little stretching required of the players and provides a sort of 'business as usual' backdrop for the real crux of the story, the waxing relationship between Depp and Pacino and the waning relationship between Depp and Heche.

Lynch, in an apparent effort to stretch, appears to becomes obsessive about this noir nonsense which by all accounts is a huge movie but which exit polls at theaters would probably reveal to be a loser. Bottom line, I about fell asleep from boredom as Lynch took his own sweet time pulling together the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle which develops into just so much excessive silliness. On the up side Watts turns in a stellar performance and Lynch limps along with no big names. On the down side is everything else: No characters we can identify or empathize with; no hero or anyone we can care about; a shoddy convoluted plot which just gets more ridiculous as time wears on; etc..yadayadayada. Bottom line, this movie sucked except for the titillating nude chicks making out part which only engages the limbic system.

Today is remains a must see for anyone into deep film while the masses may pass it over as it makes the rounds on broadcast.

","There are plenty of resources for info about the infamous and well documented Mogadishu fiasco recounted in 'Blackhawk Down'. The film is both artistically and technically excellent. However, character depth and story is sacrificed in the interest of squeezing as much action as possible into a somewhat difficult to follow orgy of bullets and blood. Recommended for those interested in watching a failed close-in tactical U.S. Army combat operation up close and personal.  A first rate military action film.Note - Those interested in the actual events; planning, chronology, logistics, politics, and accounting of what went wrong, etc. should look elsewhere.",8,7,11,12 June 2002
Quiz Show," A Quiz Show where only the audience wins.
","'Quiz Show' is a dramatic dissection of the 50's NBC quiz show scandal. An excellent production in general with the 'feel' of a theatrical docudrama, the film does a good job of showing the nebulous nature of corruption; the blurring of good and evil, the compromising of moral precepts, the 'whistle blowing', the covering up, the rationalizations, and the rest of the dialectic which all such scandals seem to follow. (eg: Watergate, The Insider, Erin Brocovich, etc.) 'Quiz Show' has no clear winners with the exception of the audience. Its slightly obvious presentation makes it an enjoyable watch for all.",7,0,4,9 April 2001
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Disappointing and forgettable
","'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a sloppy mess of a movie which dumps sci-fi, romance, camp comedy, and mediocre drama into a Mulligan stew seasoned with intellectual grunge. The film spends most of its run time flashing to and fro between a romantically involved couple's happy days and a sort of lame white out job of their memories of each other. The upside to this flick is its solid cast and remarkable public and critical approval. The downside is it's an ill focused, pathos drenched mess with peripheral nonsense which detracts from the core theme making the 'buy-in' difficult. Reminiscent of Kaufman's 'Being John Malkovich' in its lunacy, this film proves once again that creativity is not necessarily a good thing. For Kaufman fans only. (C+)",6,7,24,21 October 2004
The Last Samurai," The usual.
","In 'The Last Samurai', Cruise is a burned out ex-soldier (circa 1870's) who's crawled into a whiskey bottle to escape the guilt he feels for having seen it all, done it all, etc., at the Little Big Horn, etc...blaa, blaa. To pull down some big bucks, he signs on as a mercenary to help Japan get rid of a bunch of Samurais who, for reasons unknown, try to kill the modern Japanese army even though Samurais are peaceful warriors who only fight at the Emperor's command, etc...blaa, blaa. Cruise decides the way of the Samurai is for him because they dig cherry blossoms and mysteriously answer all questions with questions and Americans kill Indian women and children. So, Cruise, who magically learns the Japanese language in less than a semester, gets his mojo going and sets about to make war with the Japanese imperial army and....blaa, blaaa...hence, the title. Things you should know include: 40% of the dialogue is Japanese and that means subtitles. Also, the film is 2.5 hours long (seems longer). When all is said and done,  'The Last Samurai' is a pop top Hollywood product complete with hype, an over-rated centerpiece (Cruise), lots of mediocre epic action, and a token hottie. In other words, a typical blockbuster. No more, no less. (B)",7,0,3,5 May 2004
Life Is Beautiful," A elephant of a film.
","Much has been written about 'Life Is Beautiful' and there can be no doubt it has touched many viewers is a very positive way. However, everything about this film from sets to acting to costuming, etc. is good but certainly not worthy of most of the tribute paid it. What is unique about this film is the story and the tender way it touches the heart. Not satire, not drama, not comedy, 'La Vita e Bella' is farce. Grand and extraordinary farce which could well make the Bard himself take notice. Just as the blind men feeling the elephant each had a different interpretation of the beast, so will viewers each have a different interpretation of this film. However, one cannot escape the fact that this is a elephant of a film.",8,0,3,22 December 2000
The Legend of 1900," A wonderfully wistful mixture of melodrama and music.
","'The Legend of 1900' wistfully tells its creative, capriciously unpredictable, and musical tall tale with excellence in all aspects of film from sets to sound, costume to casting, and script to screenplay. Roth and Vince work well together in this plaintive, simple story which will captivate those who can make the leap of faith required to 'buy in'. A good film for all but critics, 'Legend' will likely resonate most with those who equate living with musical expression. La vita è musica.",8,59,70,9 February 2001
From Hell," More of a curiosity than a conquest
","'From Hell', yet another 'Jack the Ripper' flick, is somewhat over wrought with lavish cinematography imbuing what we'd like to believe is a bleak and dank Whitechapel District of London with richness; a street whore protagonist (Graham) somehow insulting in her sweetness; and a Scotland Yard sleuth (Depp) uncharacteristically dashing considering his beginning and his end. In spite of these and many other foibles, the Hughes bros and company have breathed life into the old and moldy 'Ripper' lore with a film which propagates still another hypothesis, a somewhat interesting and entertaining story though more of a curiosity and a conquest. Worth a look especially for those who are unfamiliar with good ol' 'Jack's' tall tale.",7,5,8,15 May 2002
Pulp Fiction," Sensationalistic crime flick missing one ingredient.
","Color me stupid but I thought 'Pulp Fiction' sucked. Being creative is easy when there are no rules...as in fantasies and cartoons and, well, pulp fiction. Creativity is not easy when the rules of reality are imposed. The reason why it took me several sessions over several  years to finally assimilate this boring piece of filmdom crap is simply because its silly story and peculiar characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring...not unlike Sunday morning cartoons. Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure. Bottom line, 'Pulp...' -is- pulp fiction brought to the big screen with all the gratuitous filth and violence of a dime novel but without the one thing which could really have made it interesting.

","'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels' is an over-rated, somewhat original dark crime comedy out of the UK which wears itself out early in its 1.6 hour run. Telling of a bunch of small time hoodlums, some smaller than others, 'Lock, Stock...' is a convoluted tale which uses the same in-your-face monotonic deadpan exaggerated comedic effect in every scene. The characters are all vulgar misfits comic book males who become drones of monotony in short order. The contrasty sepia visual effect also wears thin unless you enjoy looking at jaundiced hepatitis patients in poor, almost posterized quality.

Three Colors: Blue," All Binoche
","'Blue 1993' is the story of the emotional self-reconstruction of a woman (Binoche) who survived a car crash which killed her husband and daughter. With the panache, style, and visual artistry of the best French films and abiding the 'less is more' philosophy of film making, 'Blue' tells its story by filling the screen with the subtleties of expression and behavior of the central character. The antithesis of Tinsel Town commercialism, this critically acclaimed, award winning Binoche tour-de-force is likely to bore the socks off many American audiences but is a great watch for those into artsy Euro-flicks.",7,2,7,21 March 2001
The Untouchables," Old school Hollywood melodrama
","'The Untouchables' tells the tale of G-man Elliott Ness'  campaign to unseat Chicago mob boss Al Capone (circa 1930's). Given the Hollywood clout behind this flick (De Palma, Mamet, etc.), the film is surprisingly lackluster and fraught with overacting, staginess, some hokey scripting, and fictionalizations. Nonetheless, 'The Untouchables' will make an entertaining couch potato watch for those looking for no-brainer gangland melodrama.

","'Mystic River' centers on a murder investigation involving three men - all friends as boys from a Boston working class neighborhood -  who have taken different directions through life. One is an excon (Penn) whose daughter was murdered.  Another is the homicide investigator (Bacon) who is assigned to the case. The third is an emotionally damaged man (Robbins) who is suspect. Eastwood has imbued this novel adaptation with his signature blend of grit and humanness and created a forum for high intensity drama superbly executed by the principals, most notably Penn, who wrestle with roots, regrets, recrimination, revenge, reconciliation, and much more. With plaudits from all corners, 'Mystic River' is a must see for drama junkies, fans of the players, etc. (A-)",8,14,25,9 June 2004
Enemy at the Gates," American & Brit actors play Soviets & Germans. Duh!
","Excellent production talent provides a gritty war-torn backdrop reminiscent of 'Saving Private Ryan' for this weak story and poor historical account of the Battle for Stalingrad, a pivotal fight in the WWII European theater. The film tells of a Soviet war hero and sniper (Law) who squares off against a dogged adversary and top German sniper (Harris) providing the suspense and intrigue. The love story is played out like a clumsy after-thought and the use of big name stars for box office bucks when many good European actors could have added realism to the film was a typically self-serving Hollywood decision. Hoskins playing Khrushchev with his limey accent was laughable not to mention Harris as a German or Law as a Soviet and no attempt to fake an accent by anyone. A typical could-have-been-better flick which will entertain the masses and make the money mongers of filmdom happy while movie purists grumble.",7,3,6,15 August 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Hypekill.
","There's little doubt that 'A Beautiful Mind' is an excellent film. There's also little doubt that it was buoyed from buzz to Oscar acclaim by hype, strategic PR, and a gullible public. Taken in and of itself the film is rather ordinary among excellent films and not worthy of much of the critical acclaim it garnered. I personally found much of the film uninteresting, tedious, and downright boring. After all, how does one relate to someone whose accomplishments are so abstract as to be buried in esoteric symbolism and someone whose illness is so intangible as to be a state of mind? The beauty of mathematics and the war with the demons of delusions were not brought sufficiently into focus by the film which spent too much time trying to develop a rather uninteresting character, making his delusions our delusions, spicing it up with a car chase and shootout, fleshing out the mental ghosts, and showing the principal's eccentricism with endless scribbling on window glass. Compensate for the hype, keep expectations low, and enjoy.",7,3,8,27 June 2002
Love Actually," For romantics only. All others need not apply.
","A poet once wrote (paraphrasing); the sweetest fruit on the tree of life is love in bloom. 'Love Actually' attempts to capitalizes on that thesis by serving up huge helpings of that 'sweet fruit' and showing us a bunch of people falling more or less in love. With a carousel of  characters from a young boy to a couple of softcore actors to a rock star to the Prime Minister and more, this panorama of people passes round and round before our eyes as they gravitate towards one another more or less awkwardly falling in love until the culmination when the music swells and the couples come rapturously together. Sassy, silly, sarcastic, and sentimental, this fun flick features an excellent cast, good production value, great music, and a solid pedigree. On the downside, it's schmaltzy, unabashedly contrived, corny, commercial and  conglomerated. For romantics only, 'Love Actually' requires a certain amount of just going with it. Those who can make the buy-in should enjoy this busy testament to that which conquers all. (B+)",8,1,7,1 May 2004
Man on Fire," Over wrought
","A guilt ridden, Bible reading, alcoholic ex-counter insurgency assassin, Creasy (Washington), takes a job as body guard for a little girl (Fanning) in Mexico only to see her snatched from under his nose by a Mexican crime cartel. Predictably, Washington then goes on a one man mission of revenge with a promise to 'off' anyone who profited from the girl's murder. According to his compadre (Walken), he's an artist, his art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece. 'Man on Fire', which fared much better with the public than the critics, is a run-of-the-mill action/drama which fills up its almost 2.5 hour run with lots of concocted drama, super macho action, and annoying visual effects which do more to detract than embellish. Washington isn't the usual sweaty, muscular Schwarzenegger or Stallone one man army and subtitles which jump around on screen changing fonts and zipping form the mouths speaking the Spanish don't help. Nonetheless, 'Man on Fire' will be worth a DVD rental for Denzel fans and should make for an enjoyable no brainer small screen watch. (B-)",6,12,23,15 September 2004
Downfall," Bravo
","'Downfall' takes you into Hitler's bunker during the fall of the third Reich and the last ten days of the battle for Berlin. This historical docudrama spends its time examining one of history's most enigmatic and inscrutable dictators as he descend into paranoia to the bewilderment of his inner circle and, in particular, one young woman stenographer who, in real life, survived the war and published her memoirs providing one of the few historical records of that time and place. The film is well done as a stand alone dramatic presentation. However, it excels as an historical drama by providing insights into Hitler's last days; something never dealt with in such detail before in film. An engrossing 2.5 hour watch with a splendid performance by Bruno Ganz as Hitler. Who better to make such a film than the Germans? Bravo. (B+)",8,4,9,4 August 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Nonsense comedy
","'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is all about Will Ferrell as the title character who anchors for a San Diego, CA news show during a time when news anchors are all male. Enter Christina Applegate who steals the newsman's heart and the seat next to him to the chagrin of other male news anchors. An unsophisticated 'stupid humor' comedy romp full of extreme stereotyping and silliness heaped on nonsense following the more is more approach to comedy, 'Anchorman...' offers cameos by the likes of Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins and more. However, given all that it has going for it, the film still did not receive as much lauding as other comedies with much fewer resources such as 'Naopleon Dynamite' or 'Danny Deckchair'. Should work best for Ferrell fans, the beer and pretzels crowd, and others into less than sophisticated humor. (B-)",6,2,5,31 December 2004
Hitch," No hitch in Hitch
","'Hitch' is all about Will Smith as the Alex Hitchens aka the Date Doctor, a dating consultant to socially inept men who need some polishing to become skillful navigators of the dating scene. A fresh and fun new age flick with old school values which mixes good advice with wit and charm as we watch the Date Doc work miracles with a portly and clumsy client while wrestling with his own foible fraught relationship. 'Hitch' is a thoroughly enjoyable little flick with good casting and solid production value which makes a creative foray into the tired old romantic comedy genre with very pleasant results.

Given it's pedigree, this film is a dud. Too long at 2 hours, full of filler and commercial product impressions, and very predictable throughout, 'The Terminal' tries to build a story around the Hanks character including wooing a flight attendant (Zeta-Jones) while bathing in a public restroom, eating at BURGER KING, buying a HUGO BOSS suit, and carrying around his precious PLANTERS DRY ROASTED PEANUTS can, etc. With yawns from the critics and a lukewarm reception by the public, 'The Terminal' is fodder for fans only.

Vanilla Sky," Cheap shot
","Filmdom is full of cheap shots; easy ways to bemuse, titillate, shock, etc. in the name of entertainment. The old screeching cat jumping out during a contrived suspenseful moment is one of the cheapest shots. Palming off dreams as reality only to later reveal they were dreams is another. Playing with the time domain is still another.

Any Given Sunday," North Dallas Forty on steroids
","Oliver Stone tackles pro football with this high octane dissection of a fictional Miami team. On the short side, the film's story about an aging coach doesn't show us anything new and presents a minimal challenge to Pacino. On the long side, the film is crisscrossed with subplots, showcases some fine acting talent, serves up plenty of bone-jarring grid iron action, and revs up the tempo so the 166 minute running time passes quickly. If nothing else, this entertaining flick reminds us that pro football is not a sport but a business which chews up and spits out athletes in its lust to separate the fan from his money.",7,2,5,6 September 2000
Bruce Almighty," Bein' God ain't easy
","'Bruce Almighty' tells the story of a man who becomes God, with some restrictions, and learns that his actions have consequences and being almighty isn't as easy as he thought. Panned by the critics and a mixed bag for the man in the street, it's safe to say that if you like Jim Carrey, you'll probably like this flick. However, what most people are missing are the very positive messages about selflessness this film has to offer...something all those people who submit comments about this film might want to heed the next time they use the personal pronoun 'I' in their commentary. Fact is, we don't care what they think. We only care what we think. So, are they thinking about us? Perhaps an occasional reminder about selflessness can be a good thing in a movie.

Though the plot is unoriginal, 'Identity' offers good star power, state-of-the-art technicals, and sufficient intrigue in its circuitous and convulsive denouement to whet the interest of anyone in the mood for a smart blood and guts thriller. As the film plays out, however, some will find the excesses numbing, others will bemoan the absence of the conventional hero vs villain storyline, and still others will be fully engrossed for the duration.

X2: X-Men United," Good stuff if you like comic books.
","'X2' tells another tale about our favorite mutants and a few new ones too but it's not likely anyone is really going to care about the story. What the film has to offer is solid effects, heavy on the CGI, with babes, kids who kick butt, lots of cool special powers, and action and stunts up the wazoo. In other words, it's a good flick for younger audiences, comic book freaks, and the like. Personally, I grew utterly bored with it and gave up about 10 minutes before the end. Nonetheless, it's a respectable effort and probably better than 'X1' (X-Men) in most respects. (B-)",6,0,4,26 November 2003

Final Destination," An above average thriller/horror flick.
","Although it falls well short of anything by Poe or Hitchcock, 'Final Destination' is somewhat more intelligent than most films of this genre. Apparently targeting the usual teen market, this commercial thriller gets off to a good start, then lags a bit as it wallows in the usual blood and guts, and finishes somewhat better. Sawa does a good job of not over acting, supporting acting is on par, and the special effects seem almost believable. Most of all, the nemesis is never really defined which gives this film a somewhat unique mystique.",5,2,5,26 September 2000

Happily married with kids, he secretly begins taking ballroom dance lessons and finds there's more to life than beautiful women staring mournfully from dance studio windows. This film offers comedy, dancing, poignant moments, more dancing, some romance, and still more dancing, etc. With a good cast, high end production, and 'old school' sentiments, it may not have Fred and Ginger, but it's a fun mix for more mature audiences, especially those into ballroom.

","'Hart's War' is a stalag flick which tells of events among the American soldiers suffering hardship in a WWII prison camp. The film scores points for good art, technicals, and performances. However, it trades reality for drama and spins a somewhat convoluted story about racism, murder, and smoldering secrets inside the compound which it finds difficult to sort out and ultimately fizzles in the end.

The film's flaws may also be its virtues as being fraught with over acting; meaningless family and other scenes designed to push emotional buttons; almost complete neglect of Johnson, Jackie, etc.; and unnecessary action sequence spice may all suffice to encourage viewing by younger audiences of which many may have never heard of the crisis.

Gangs of New York," Over-wrought melodramatic history-fiction mishmash.
","'Gangs of New York' mixes real American history with a weak fictional human drama and a thick coat of Hollywoodization resulting in an over wrought behemoth wannabe epic misfire. Scorcese pulls together bits and pieces of the Civil War  conscription act, Irish potato famine immigration, Tammany Hall  and Tweed corruption, race/slave issues, slum gangs, etc. and creates a milieu which has an off-target post-apocalyptic sort of feel and then tries to cram DiCaprio down our throats as a hero though he does nothing particularly heroic in the context of the film. The flick features blood and guts street riots reminiscent of 'Braveheart', a romance which doesn't work, an evil guy over acted by Day-Lewis and little else save a whole bunch of filler to give us a taste of the times and milk the extravagance for all its worth. In spite of all that, 'Gangs...' received several Oscar noms and a thumb and a half up from critical corners with so-so approval from the public.

What could have been a powerful epic which clearly defined the undercurrents of good and evil responsible the climate of political unrest and upheaval in Rome instead takes a simplistic 'good guy' versus 'bad guy' approach, gets too involved in it's own grandeur, and substitutes action for story telling with the likely result of a disconnected audience which will not feel the empathy and emotion such a film should command.

Cut from the same cloth as the parent 'The Bourne Identity', this flick is bits and pieces of a thin story squeezed between protracted periods of busyness which is long on mediocre action and short on human drama.

Unwilling to give up his small time but nerd-friendly operation, Vaughn challenges Stiller to settle the dispute over a champion dodgeball tournament in Vegas. Factor in a babe and the usual good vs evil elements with the underdog issue and a screenplay which is hyperkinetic and kaleidoscopic and the result is an enjoyable comedy romp worth a look by anyone who enjoyed similar Stiller fare such as 'Zoolander' or 'Duplex' or 'Starsky & Hutch' or 'Envy', etc. (B)",6,1,3,15 December 2004

Built around an intelligent, non-stop script; a excellent talk-to-the-camera performance by Cusack; and a cadre of quality supporting actors, this film will be lauded and loathed for it's break-the-rules bravura, it's esoteric pop music purist milieu, and it's very male perspective. 'Hi-fi' showcases a rising star on the American film frontier in Iben Hjejle and is possibly John Cusack's finest hour...so far.",9,0,1,22 September 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Good old fashioned fun uniquely Coen.
","'O Brother' is a meandering comedy set in 1930's Mississippi which tells of the misadventures of three chain-gang escapees. A highly original and creative piece of work, the film amuses, taunts, and teases as it delivers a cleverly crafted script, some unique characters, and simple fun with little fanfare. As with other Coen flicks, the hype is after the premier and comes from the audience...the best kind. Good fun most likely to be appreciated or understood by mature folks...people who remember pomade, spittoons, sparkling oil, and phosphates. Did that car really hit the cow?",8,0,2,13 June 2001
