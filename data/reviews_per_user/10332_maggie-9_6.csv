Minority Report," I'm sorry - I need to believe in something in a movie - mild spoilers
","Most of those who have seen Minority report appear to like it but it did very little for me.  From the first moment I heard about the plot, I had doubts about the concept.  Infallible pre-cognition and arresting people before they commit a crime are ideas which, on close examination, have so many holes in them that more suspension of belief is needed than I can cope with.  (There have been much more interesting plots which postulated forms of pre-cognition which were much less reliable and therefore much more interesting) If you add to the problems of the main premise the physical characteristics of the world portrayed, which are inconsistent and in some cases pretty ridiculous, and it all becomes too much.  I did not believe that the pre-cogs would be able to stay alive in the environment shown or then cope out of it, I did not believe that the police would fly around in such clunky machines when they could build such aerodynamically engineered cars.  And I don't believe there is any way this can happen by 2054.  Why didn't they just make it far further into the future?There were a few good things and Spielberg is always an interesting director.  But these cannot weigh against what, in essence, was a pretty weak thriller based on an unacceptable premise. And then on top of it we have Cruise at his grungiest and most unappealing. I really should go with my gut instinct and not subject myself to things I strongly suspect I am not going to like but hope springs eternal.",5,2,4,23 June 2002
Memento," Still not sure what I think (major spoilers)
","I find that with most films I am pretty sure of my reaction on leaving or soon after.  This is the exception.  I still don't know what I think.This is undoubtedly a cleverly-made and extremely well-acted piece, with Guy Pearce a standout.  It is based on an excellent idea, mostly well carried out.  So why am I not sure I have witnessed a great film?For one thing I think the device of working back through the story became somewhat mechanical towards the middle.  I was rather tired and actually found myself nodding off a bit and having to force myself to concentrate.Secondly, I discovered with the Usual Suspects that there is something quite unsatisfying about a movie in which nothing that has happened may have been real.  With Memento, what actually happens in the film is quite real; that is, Lenny is angry because of what Teddy tells him and he makes a conscious decision to record information about Teddy which will lead him (after he has forgotten the actual conversation) to hunt Teddy down and kill him believing that Teddy is his wife's killer.  The trouble is, we can't believe Teddy ourselves and therefore we know nothing at all at the end about Lenny, nothing about his wife, nothing about whether his memories of Sammy are real, just nothing.  I found this unsatisfying.  I don't demand that all ends get tied up but some resolution is needed.I think ultimately I didn't actually believe in the validity of Lenny's condition as portrayed.  My feeling is that, if such a condition exists, it would be infinitely more disabling than shown, (more in fact like the portrayal of Sammy than of Lenny).  It might be argued that movies can set their own rules but this is a movie which invites us to think about it.  The trouble is, some movies begin to break up when you think about them too much, the inconsistencies appear and you lose the emotion you might have had when watching them.Several comments have mentioned that the movie deserved more than an art house release.  Here in Australia, it is showing at my local multiplex, and has been quite extensively advertised.  But I think quite a lot of the audience will feel uncomfortable with it.  Not because they are too thick to understand it but because, ultimately, our possible concern for Lenny (generated mostly by Guy Pearce's performance) is dissipated by the self-conscious technique of the story.I'm still not sure if, for me, this was a flawed masterpiece or a waste of time.",Null,0,1,8 April 2001
Lost in Translation," Do reactions need to be so black and white?
","I have read a lot of the comments since at last catching up with the movie this week. Audience reactions seem to be polarised between those who love it and those that found it boring. I have neither of those reactions.On the whole I enjoyed watching it. I have no problem with movies which take their time and each scene had something to like; whether it was cinematography, acting or situation.But I did not love it. I was not left with a feeling of satisfaction at the end because the characters did not go on a journey which I could appreciate. I suppose the question is: do we want movies to reflect life or to tell a story. Most of the time when I am in the cinema, I want to be told a story even if the plot or resolution are somewhat unrealistic. There is enough real life out there for us all to experience. I am not asking for a conventional romantic drama but as least some conflict or temptation.I would contrast this with another Scarlett Johanssen film, Girl with a Pearl Earring, which I enjoyed much more. This also was a slow burn of a film, but there was an outcome of sorts (the picture) and there was more love shown for the setting. Here Tokyo is caricatured and the lack of script seemed to distance us from the characters.I don't think watching this was anything like waste of time and Copolla has talent to spare, but I wonder if I shall ever feel moved to see it again.",7,1,3,9 December 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," Enjoyable, fluffy: why all the angst?
","This film has only just opened in Australia and I don't normally post anything about films with a couple of hundred existing comments.  But I have been surprised at how seriously people have taken it and the dislike which seems to flow from that.  I like a good light romantic comedy (OK, if you like, a chick flick).  And this is one.  Quite a good one of its kind and well acted.  Enjoy.PS I haven't lived in the UK for twenty years but I was born in London and lived in the London area until to moved to Australia.  It most certainly does snow, not every year and more after Christmas than at Christmas but it does happen.  In fact I distinctly remember once abandoning my car in a huge snowdrift in central London and walking with difficulty five miles to my home in South London.",Null,0,0,27 July 2001
The Insider," Not as good as I expected it to be
","The insider was one of those films I was hyped up to see because of all the positive vibes about it coming from the US.  Maybe this was the problem. My expectations were too high.There were two problems for me.  The first is that I don't find Al Pacino a very interesting actor these days.  He seems to repeat the same mannerisms from film to film and his character (the crusading journalist forced to betray his principles) is one seen in many films.  The dilemma of the whistleblower  himself (played very well by Russell Crowe) was much more interesting but didn't get enough screen time for real insight.The second problem was the directing style.  None of the methods used is poor in itself.  The trouble is that everything was overused.  I kept noticing every unnecessary camera jerk, focus change or cut.  If you find yourself consciously noticing style and missing the substance of the story, something is wrong.  Also the sound was often muddy and the music intrusive.This is not a bad film by any means.  I don't regret going to see it but, in my opinion, it does not have the greatness claimed by so many.",Null,0,0,25 February 2000
Am√©lie," Maybe it's me but after a while the quirkiness palls-MILD SPOILERS
","I tend not to write comments on well-reviewed films which I have myself hugely enjoyed.  It is when I feel somewhat let down that I want to analyse why.  It is certainly not because I despise sentimentality (I am a notorious weeper at movies, even in the happy bits) or I don't like foreign films (because I see many).  I found the first half an hour or so absolutely hilarious, funnier than anything I have seen recently.  But after a while I felt irritation building.  I found myself feeling that Amelie was unnecessarily toying with Nino, and I felt that I didn't know her well enough as a real person to sympathise with her actions.  When I lost some touch with the story around the middle, the style of film-making became overwhelming and I was noticing that style rather than the action. I found myself preferring the somewhat more naturalistic scenes in the cafe than Amelie's doings.  There was much I liked (including the globetrotting gnome and the matter-of-fact porn shop) and I did enjoy it much more than many films I have seen recently, but I still cannot feel part of the general feeling of love shown by most reviewers.",Null,1,2,29 January 2002
