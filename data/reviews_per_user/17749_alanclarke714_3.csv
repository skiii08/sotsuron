Insidious: Chapter 2," A Worthy Horror Sequel That's Somewhat Different
","With Insidious, James Wan and Leigh Whannell introduced us to the Lambert family, who were being tormented by beings that existed in a realm called The Further. Dalton, one of two sons of Renai and Josh Lambert, can create an astral projection of himself when he sleeps. With the end of the first film, the family thinks it's all over and they can finally settle down. But when more dire and disturbing happenings grip the family, they soon figure out that Josh, who ventured into the Further to save Dalton, is not really Josh, but an evil spirit that will do anything to live again.James Wan is the master of the horror film. Yes, The Exorcist is a classic, as is Alien and Psycho, but every horror movie James Wan has directed are anywhere from good to phenomenal, especially with his other film this year, The Conjuring, which set the bar for future horror films. Insidious Chapter 2 I would not compare to The Conjuring because, well, it's not based on a true story and it is a sequel. This does not mean, though, it is any less disturbing or frightening. With a few nods to Stephen King's The Shining (Josh looking like a completely insane father out for blood), Insidious Chapter 2 felt like a roller-coaster of intensity. The acting was top-notch, especially newcomer Steve Coulter, who plays Carl, an old friend of Elise. Patrick Wilson was just downright creepy here, being possessed by the Bride in Black. Like the first film, the musical score was unsettling, frightening and memorable (if you saw the first movie, you know the theme well). The production, the set pieces were all fantastic, with the hospital being a very, very haunting addition, adding to the already eerie atmosphere. The script was very good and well-written, with a surprisingly great balance of some witty comedy from Specs and Tucker, and terrifying scares.Insidious Chapter 2 I would say, is neither better nor worse than the first chapter, because the story is more grounded, acting as more a psychological thriller than a supernatural horror film. But with how the film ends, they can easily make Chapter 3 that can end this horror series before it becomes like Saw and Paranormal Activity; having sequels that get worse and worse as it goes.",9,3,5,13 September 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," A Brilliant Sci-fi Blockbuster & A Wonderful Experience
","Edge of Tomorrow centers around Major William Cage (Cruise) who, after dying in battle fighting alien creatures called Mimics, begins to relive the same day over and over. But, when Rita Vrataski (Blunt) reveals one the battlefield to Cage that she knows more about what's happening to him than he does, they work together through the 'resets' to try and stop the Mimics from wiping out humanity.Edge of Tomorrow isn't a completely original story, but how it's crafted and written is very original, as is the take on the time-travel-like premise. Doug Liman's direction is easily his best by far, constantly changing the tone from light-hearted fun & action to deep, emotion- driven conflict. The very first battle sequence when the troops land on the beach is absolutely breath-taking, and mirrors that of Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' with horrific accuracy. The performances by all the actors and actresses were amazing, but with our two leads obviously stealing the show whenever they're on screen. The chemistry between Cruise and Blunt is fantastic, and you feel attached to both characters within seconds of them meeting each other. The script was great, blending gritty, phenomenal action scenes with hart-felt emotion and laughs. That's right, genuine comedy is thrown into the mix of jaw- dropping action and visuals, of which deserve multiple awards. The creature design of the Mimics alone deserves multiple wins; they're honestly on my Top 3 most frightening alien creatures in film. The cinematography is wonderful, the musical score is fitting and worth a stand-alone listen, and the film overall is an epic feat of brilliant story-telling. I personally just wished the ending was a bit deeper and more emotionally satisfying, but since it was a definite ending, i still enjoyed it.Edge of Tomorrow was not just an amazing movie, but honestly a kind of experience. I felt like i was with Cage the entire time, going through the same horrific day. I felt his pain and frustration during training, going from a coward to a battle-hardened warrior; Cruise proves once again he's one of the best actors of our time, and Emily Blunt one of the best actresses of our time. I really hope Cruise and Blunt work together again, because they were so brilliant together.",9,0,3,15 June 2014
Godzilla," An Epic Re-Imagining That Sadly Falls Short with the Human Drama
","Godzilla, directed by Gareth Edwards and written by Max Borenstein, is the epic re-imagining of the King of the Monsters. When the Janjira Power Plant in Japan is destroyed, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) believes that 'something' caused it, and that it wasn't a meltdown. But his son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) thinks his father is crazy, until they return to the plant to find that there are forces greater than themselves at work, and the entire world is at risk.I really don't understand why some people are hating on this movie, whether it be 'Godzilla wasn't in it long enough' or 'it was just lame.' The latter isn't even a reason, it's an excuse, and the first reason is just sad. This Godzilla is like the 'Batman Begins' in a Godzilla franchise. Gareth Edwards' directing was outstanding in every way; there were so many moments where i felt the film was much darker and violent than it needed to be. Sadly, the script didn't live up to Edwards' direction. The Frank Darabont-aided script was good without a doubt, but once the first act is over with and Joe Brody's story arc finished, the human element is almost entirely absent. Bryan Cranston brought an Oscar-worthy performance, and was quickly taken out of the film, which angered a lot of people in the theater I was in (myself included). So, if anyone were to hate on this movie, the only reason i could see is that Bryan Cranston wasn't given enough screen-time; he deserved to be in the film until the end, at least. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was great, but in the second act, he was a static and generic 'everyman' fighting for his family. But, in the third act, there was much more emotional investment in the character as he strove to follow his father's advice; 'Protect your family, whatever the cost.' Elizabeth Olsen was surprisingly incredible in her role as Ford's wife, who was worrying both about her husband and their son. Ken Wantanabe was fantastic as Dr. Serizawa, a man who wants to learn as much as he can about Godzilla. The visual effects, well, are easily the best to date, and even the cinematography is some of the best I've seen in recent films (tied with the cinematography of Transcendence). Then, the musical score was darkly brooding and haunting in all the right ways. Now i don't understand the people who say the score was 'too loud' or 'overbearing' in the film, as the score is supposed to be; even the horns in some of the tracks represented alarms during the really intense action scenes.Godzilla was and is a truly epic rebirth of the Toho creation, but sadly did not have the emotional investment the first act of the film had. Still, Godzilla lives up to its name and ends with a ground-breaking finale to help alleviate the lack of human drama.9/10 Stars",9,27,47,16 May 2014
