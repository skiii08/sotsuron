The Ring," A Scary Movie!!!!!!
","Even-though I had already seen the original version of the Ring I must say that this remake is not bad at all. For all of you haven't seen the original movie I will say see the remake first and then try to get your hand on the Japanese version of the movie. This movie is not one of your blood and gore movie, it is very refreshing to have Hollywood to make a horror movie that doesn't have sex or violence in mind. This movie is a thinking man's of a horror movie which requires one to put some efforts into figuring out what the movie is about and not have to spell it out for you. The Ring is not one of the best horror movie out there, but it is not one of the worst either. Different people, different taste I must say.",9,0,0,18 October 2002
Silent Hill," Faithful to the Core
","This got to be the most realistic adaptation of a video game to movie today, and yet it works as a stand-alone movie. The problem with movies that are based on game and book is that if you have played the game or read the book already you will feel as if you were watching a re-run. For those that have not played the game, it will be a lot of information one needs to sort through to understand it. For most part, this movie copies the looks and feels of the game spot-on. The first half of the movie WILL send goose-bumps up and down your back as the town of Silent Hill and the atmospheres that surrounds it seems to rip it right off the game itself. I will tip my hat to the production designer for this film as he or she did an outstanding job. Nothing beats the creepiness of a lone woman walking down an empty street in an abandon town with a bad dose of ju-ju.The monsters in this film are few when comparing to other movies that are based on video game, and their appearances are brief. Also, due to the nature of Silent Hill's game play, the protagonist doesn't engages the monsters but rather, avoiding them. The computer special effects are what drives this movie, and they will shock-and-awe you.The pace of this film is also slower than most of movies of video game, but this is needed to provide the necessary creepy atmosphere that's the mainstay of the game, but 2/3 into the movie the pace of the storyline becomes bogged down with dialogs trying to explain everything. Which makes this film that is not heavy on the actions seems even slower to those who was bred on MTV.All in all, I like this movie for its truthfulness to the game it is portraying and the craftsmanship of the production value, and at two hours long it doesn't seems to be long enough.",8,17,35,21 April 2006
The Village," The Movie that We do not speak of
","Although I love the the way the film was filmed, but this movie have no story arc, no character development, and no ending. This movie ended in the same place as it started, no one have grown any wiser, no problem was ever solved, and nothing was gained. The film have many plot holds in it, for example, as others have pointed out where did all other town people come from if it was the core elders who come up with the idea in the first place? Where did they get all that fuel oil to burn at night? They must have cornered the lamp oil market. Even if the lamp oil are supplied from the outside world how do they get it? No matter how rich the leader was, there was just no way of keeping the outside world from intruding, and then how far the elder will go to keep their secrets.",Null,0,0,31 July 2004
The Descent," Girls Gone Wild
","I really want to like this movie, a movie about a bunch of women go caving in the Appalachian mountain. What I don't understand is why would the director use an all girls cast instead of a co-ed cast. After watching this movie I feel as if there is no purpose for casting all women in this film, a cast of male and female actors will work just fine if not better in the movie. I don't know why the director would select an all women actors for the film as the novelty of it really didn't last long when the body count starts mounting not long after they entered the cave.For the most part, once they entered the cave, the film becomes too dark in lighting for me to able to recognize which actor is doing the talking. At time I can't hardly tell what is going on while they are in the cave, but there is couple of good scenes where the girls get to kick some big time butts on the monsters, so much so that I wonder why isn't the monsters afraid of the girls rather than the other way around. There is another similar movie called The Cave released before this film and I find this movie to be more in substances as in the former movie.",5,0,1,16 December 2005
