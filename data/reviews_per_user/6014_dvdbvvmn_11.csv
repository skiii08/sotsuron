Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The prequels
","I know the prequels were heavily driven by special effects and, in retrospect, could have been done better but I fully understand the story arc.Despite the wooden dialogue, I think in time these three films will be much more appreciated than when they were first released.So I have given an 8/10 for all three films!",8,1,3,23 December 2017
It," Better than the 1990 TV adaptation but...
","If this is your first encounter with the story but haven't yet watched the film read the book first. Or even better watch the 1990 TV adaptation if you can't wait long but I suspect this film will be a disappointment.If you haven't read the book and don't know the story you will wonder what is going on if you have watched this for the first time. The whole story isn't just about children, it is about them as adults because Mike Hanlon stays in Derry and realises that children start disappearing again and he contacts them all to promise on their vow to return.Back in the 1990s I read the book twice and it is my favourite Stephen King story. I also had the DVD of the 1990 adaptation for a long time and to me a comparison is almost inevitable (for me anyway).One thing I have to say is that I think the portrayal of the clown in this version is much better than Tim Curry's but the children in that version had much better chemistry and more character development in about 90 minutes than this version did in 2 hours. I think that is the only thing that really lets it down.The other is that in the original story (if I am not mistaken) it is Mike Hanlon who does the research in to Derry's past events rather than Ben Hanscombe and that reduces Mike's contribution to the story which I think is a bit sad.",7,1,7,12 September 2017
Detroit," Could have been better if it was shorter
","Instead of starting the story at the point where the 'dramatics' are itching to get on stage and being disappointed which is where the film should have started, they start it dragging and screaming with boring exposition. Most of the world knows about US race riots and the historical tension around civil rights so we don't need a history lesson.Then the spiel at the end admits the film is based on participant recollection, as what happened wasn't conclusively proved. I think that was it's downfall.Could have been a much better film if it was 2hrs or less but it dragged.",6,1,6,16 September 2017
Darkest Hour," 'Well worth seeing just to watch Oldman's performance.' - Unfortunately, that is it's major let down
","It is by no mean's a bad film but I think, given the circumstances that the rest of Europe was facing, that the greater context should have been provided to give greater tension within the war cabinet. Even at two hours it did tend to drag. Apart from Oldman there were no other recognisable actors playing MPs or in the cabinet which made the film a bit one sided.",8,1,5,13 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," How much you like this film depends on how much of a die-hard fan you are!
","SPOILERS!!!!!I will pre-amble this by saying I'm not a true die-hard fan who knows everything about the Star Wars universe.If you are expecting to see Jedi knights and lots of light-sabre duels, be prepared to be disappointed. Remember this is a SW stand-alone story and shows a different side to the SW universe, not a part of the main saga.The whole point of the introduction for each of the main films is to provide the set-up for each episode of the saga as a whole. I understand why the crawl was not included as (a) it is a stand alone film and (b) we know the plot and we can pretty much guess what will happen at the end of the film by virtue of how ANH starts. In that respect, the story is predictable as we know they will have successfully stolen the plans. Rogue One comes before ANH so the audience had to anticipate an original plot (unlike the TFA which was a rehash of ANH). As another reviewer said, this film takes Star Wars seriously and as far as the feel of the film is concerned I would put it very close behind TESB.Having said that the part in ROTJ where they use the shuttle to land on Endor was again used similarly in R1 which I found slightly disappointing. Otherwise I couldn't see any other obvious plot similarities to those films.The downsides is that the film started off slow and, given the necessity of stealing the plans, didn't have the urgency of ANH or TESB. Though we know the outcome of the story, I think the urgency to steal the plans could have been much more life-and-death in the plot like a ticking time-bomb.There is very little in the character motivation especially Jyn aside from the fact that her father is centrally involved in the design of the death star.I understand why some of the die-hard fans will pick lots of holes and have very high expectations but I personally think it is, overall, an entertaining film.",8,1,3,18 December 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Poor writing = lost opportunity
","I heard other people in the audience literally laugh out at some of the so-called humour which I found a bit distasteful. I'm not sure why anyone would give this some comedy given the subject matter and I felt uncomfortable.The only naturally comical bit which I thought fitted in and worked well was the dinner date (that I did laugh about admittedly).I think the subplot between Mildred and Charlie was a bit weak and that could have added so much more to the story.The other subplot about Willoughby having cancer added some complexity to the story but that should have been revealed later in the story rather than early on.A very big gripe is that in the letter to Dixon Willoughby spoke of how crimes could be solved because of someone's stupidity. Magically, five or ten minutes later Dixon is in a bar after he loses his job and over-hears someone bragging about something that happened similarly 18 months previously!! Something tells me the writers thought they had a great premise (I agree it is) but weren't sure how they wanted the film to end so had to contrive up a sudden change in character that would lead to what they thought might be satisfying ending but I didn't think so. To me that is incredibly poor writing and could have been handled so much better than it was.It is a two hour film but I start to get uncomfortable if I feel it drags on for to long and it dragged. The last 45 minutes or so it was starting to run out of steam.",7,0,3,30 January 2018
Dog Day Afternoon," Funny in a tragic kind of way
",I watched this for the first time recently and I was astonished that it actually happened.It reminds me of 'Falling Down' in a way as it is about a caring and loving person who breaks the law in an act of desperation to salvage a relationship.,9,1,2,11 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Kylo says to Rey: 'You need to let go of the past'
","Any else see the irony? Disney don't seem to be doing any such thing. Whereas The Force Awakens was a blatant remake of 'A New Hope' I feared this would just be a remake of 'The Empire Strikes Back' but it wasn't quite that bad. It was more of a passable re-interpretation of the best episode in the entire series.If Mark hated what they were doing to his character he should have forced a complete script re-write or threaten to pull out.I thought the idea of trying to find a master code breaker character was a good plot line to take until they completely wasted the opportunity.The other thing is that even though I am not fully up to speed on Star Wars lore, I still cringed at Carrie trying to play super gran.I probably won't bother with the last film.",5,2,3,23 December 2017
The Shape of Water," No moral education
","Visually it is a good film but there are two things wrong with it. First is that I left the cinema without ever learning anything about human relationships. The second is that in a well-developed story it is usual for a character to learn something and change for the better. It would have been good for one of other characters to have changed in some way.It is a subtle twist on the 'beauty and the beast' story and Elisa finds someone who she can relate to. Now I've thought about it, is that the lesson? That love works in mysterious ways? That we should let go of what society expects of us when it comes to forming romantic relationships? If it is, it didn't work as well it could have.",7,3,5,18 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It isn't a terrible film but it is a film of two halves.
","I am a big fan of IMDb but I've never written a film review and it was after watching this film that I felt compelled to do so. Others have given much better objective and critical reviews than I have here.The reason why I have given it a 6 is to give it a benefit of a doubt. So disregarding its similarities to 'A New Hope', I think they have left it deliberately vague with a few loose ends.The short version: What I was really hoping for was a much better version of 'The Phantom Menace'. The long version:I love films like 'Casablanca', 'Rear Window', 'Amadeus', 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'The Pianist' and 'The Godfather' for a reason: they have strong character arcs, lots of tension and they tell a STORY!What gave me hope for this film is that I found out Lawrence Kasdan is one of the writers, he who wrote the screenplays for Ep 5 and 6. So you can imagine I thought I was in for something special with TFA - Not a rehash of 'A New Hope'.Though I liked some of the more subtle nods to the original trilogy I expected something much more original and different that would take the saga forward from where ROTJ left off. I enjoyed the first half of the film from the opening credits to where we meet Han and Chewie. It got me excited enough to think we would be back to what a Star Wars film should REALLY be about - the nostalgia and the magic. In my opinion, this film doesn't quite have the same 'je ne sais quoi' the originals had.Unfortunately the plot started to unwind almost immediately...The point at which the two groups of pirates meet with Han and Chewie on the ship and the fight with the squids didn't contribute to the plot in any way whatsoever and totally wasted screen and story time. In fact, that particular scene foretold what a farcical comedy/parody it was to become.The story's premise as told in the intro is very weak. As one other reviewer points out, if Luke wanted to disappear why leave a map for him to be found? There are lots of other plot holes in the story as well inconsistencies with the OT (for example why does Kylo have a mask? Why did they make the decision for him to take it off?). Someone said that a film is as only as good as its villain and Kylo is a very weak villain.The scenes appear to be cobbled together with a lack of any coherence. The story heavily depends on macguffins and numerous coincidences. The developing relationship between Rey and Finn also strains credulity.Say no more...Characters:I personally think Daisy stole the film as Rey though I can't help think the strength of her performance was more to do with the huge weaknesses in the other characters rather than the strength of her own character. Bringing back R2-D2 and C3-P0 was a mistake as was bringing back Chewie and Han. Harrison said he thought Han should have been killed off after Ep.5 so maybe he should have been killed off in the back story to TFA.I thought Leia was practically unrecognisable as the strong leader we loved from 'The Empire Strikes Back' (she is apparently now a General but doesn't act like one and she should have had a much more central role). Overall, as much as I really wanted to like this film I was left disappointed that the second half didn't match the first.",6,9,16,22 December 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Nominated for best film oscar ... seriously?
",George Clooney said you can make a bad film out of a good script but you can't make a good film out of a bad script. How could this film be nominated for best film but not be nominated in the screenplay category (Titanic anyone?). I really wanted to watch this in the cinema and didn't. I made the mistake of buying it on DVD without checking which oscars it was nominated for and now a part of me wished I hadn't.It isn't by any means a terrible film but I didn't feel emotionally involved with the characters not in the same way as I did with 'Saving Private Ryan'.,6,6,9,8 February 2018
