First Man," Intensive and exciting interpretation
","First of all I would like to say that I can't understand most of the ratings of other users published here. It seems that many of you have become mentally dull due to the usual blockbusters from Hollywood, which are full of successive action scenes and dull 'dialogues'.I read here an Rating of a user, which I do not name now consciously, who complained among other things about the camera work. I quote '...were shot in a way to make them resemble shaky-handed home-video footage'.I think there are some clear problems with the understanding of film production here. I know a nice saying: 'if you have no idea, you shouldn't bother your people with your unknowledge' - I personally can only say that the camera work was very well done and in such a way it was able to put the viewer right 'into the middle of the action.'It must also be said that films are also a form of art. And art can make use of artistic freedom. This in turn means that this form of art also means that you find an interpretation of the artist which corresponds to what he wanted to achieve as a result.To sum up, I can only say that Ryan Gosling has added his personal and known touch here. Anyone who has seen his films will understand what I mean. He usually has a certain calmness and coolness, for some it seems emotionless. But even a few words can say a lot, just as good pictures!In my opinion, those who rate a good movie badly simply have no understanding for this form of art and should rather watch talk shows, go drinking canned beer and don't bother others with his 'stupidity'.PS: I am not a native speaker, so please excuse any grammatical mistakes.",8,0,2,2 March 2019
