Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It Begins
","10/10. This is the first to the new or 'teeny-bopper' trilogy aimed at the younger generations. Excellent acting, great story, and mind blowing special effects are just some of the highlights. While nowhere near the calliber of the originals this still makes good for great entertainment.",8,0,1,18 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Brilliant end to a Brilliant saga
","(Warning Plot Spoilers) This is the best of the best. As the saga concludes the Rebellion launches one last all out attack on the empire. This is the last and best star wars movie, assuming Lucas doesn't make an episode 7 after this date. I give this my highest ranking 30/30. If you enjoyed the other movies this just amy become your favorite movie of all time. You'll not want to miss the conclusion especially as everything unfolds.",Null,0,0,18 February 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," RIIIIIIIIIIGHT
","Well I'll give it this, it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's A respectable effort but NOWHERE NEAR as good as the original and 3rd. Most of the stunts make absolutly no sense, (a 13<?> year old kicks a raptor out of a window???) Jeff Goldblume saves this movie, And Richard Schiff, WARNING SPOILER, was pretty good as usual but got killed way to early. he seems to always get killed or shot at in his works (this, the arrival, speed-he was the train operater, and the west wing). An ok movie but I'd only recommend you watch it if you want a good laugh or two(some people may think I'm morbid but the doghouse is one of the funniest scenes I've ever watched). 4.5/10",Null,0,0,20 July 2002
Jaws," The First and Best Summer Block Buster
","What can I say that hasn't already been said a thousand times. (*WARNING UPCOMING SPOILERS) The plot is engaging and just all out excellent. The death scenes especaly Quint's were grusome (at least they were at the time, it's no Nightmare/Halloween 2/Jason gore fest). The acting is superb, Roy scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss should have all won gold, Dreyfuss for supporting and Scheider And Shaw as a tie for best. The later is unlikely I know but hey that's my opinion. There are some who even think (i.e. Me and My Father) that Dreyfuss won for Goodbye Girl (in which he also delivers a great performance) because the Academy felt they should have given it to him for Jaws. You especaly won't want to miss the Orca scene(s), perhaps the greatest in movie history. To get the full impact, if you can watch it on a big screen at the beach, close to the fourth of July is even better.",Null,0,1,12 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Excelence
","There's so much to write about this masterpiece but there are so many long quotes that everything I want to say will be said in the others, so I'll keep this short and sweet. This is the second best film in the series. Yes I said second, Return of the Jedi beet this one out by a long shot. Even with that this movie is Excelence in it's purest and best form. From the first time you read a long time ago to the last word in the end credits you will love this movie I can almost guarantee. I've never met a person who hasn't loved this movie.",10,1,1,17 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," As the story continues
","Luke and the gang are back, this time with a little more help. In this outing as Billy Dee Williams joins the cast as Lando Callrisian, the Rebal alliance is on the run with the empire hot on there trail. While not as good as the other 2 in the original trilogy this film still packs a punch and you really have to see it to understand everything that happens after, and that includes episodes 1,2,and 3. I give it 10/10",Null,0,0,17 February 2002
