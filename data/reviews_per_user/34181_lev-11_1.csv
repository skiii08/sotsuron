Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," great movie-i was amazed!!!!
","i just wanna say that episode1: the phantom menace is one of the best movies i have seen in a while.  It has great action and fight scenes, especially at the end.  The special effects are GREAT.  The effects in the podrace(a race where aliens and young anakin ride pods pulled by two huge engines)  are astounding.  The space battle had good effects too.  Some interesting things were how artoo got famous.  Also, i was surprised by the creator of c-3PO. I dont know why some people dont like this movie.  I recommend it to everyone, even parents will like it.  So if you want to see a great action/sci-fi movie, Star Wars Episode1: The Phantom Menace is the movie for you.",10,0,0,23 June 1999
