The Avengers," Superb! Hits A High Standard Of Excellence
","Hands down, this is THE best film the genre has ever produced.All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark right on the spot. Then there's the rare beauty that hits ABOVE the mark. The Avengers is such a movie. It EXCEEDS the already high expectations. It's the best big budget movie that I've EVER seen. It honestly may be my favorite movie of all-time. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining a cool plot, breathtaking action sequences, charisma, crisp and witty dialogue, the perfect villain, actual character development and puts it all together in one amazing package. For those few out there that didn't have high expectations, this movie will surprise you with its heart while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil within each character as well as the outer friction between such diverse individuals worked exceptionally well. We really can relate to each character and why he or she feels and acts the way that they do. Rest assured that The Avengers does delivers on every level and does so with great emotional moments.It's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated and will continue to generate now that people are seeing it and falling in love with it completely.",Null,1,4,1 May 2012
Captain Marvel," What A Waste. Such a Shallow and Uninteresting Character.
","This movie really did turn out to be the 'woke' soulless mess rational fans feared that it would be. Brie Larson is indeed a joyless and weak lead. The Mary Sue was strong in this one start to finish. The humor missed the mark 75% of the time. When a movie misses three out of four times in that department AND is more worried about sending virtue signaling messages then it has to be considered a failure in terms of quality. Judging it as a drama and entertainment, it fails miserably if you're being truly honest. What aids to save face is its overall ties to the MCU. Fury was a bit of a neutered tool but it was great to see young Phil Coulson even briefly. The Tesseract tie and the Skrulls were damn cool and they referenced what was to come without completely ruining what we've already seen and enjoyed in the MCU. (Except the Fury eye loss, that adds to this movie's cringe factor) I seriously hope that for Endgame they limit Captain Marvel's presence because she is just such a shallow and uninteresting character.",Null,11,19,7 March 2019
Iron Man 2," Fun but also Smart! It has the right amount of humor, angst and drama
","Iron Man 2 sure delivers the fun but it's such intelligent fun. Honestly, its Stan Lee meets Shakespeare. The Hammer/Stark rivalry is more like Hamlet and Claudius then Superman to Lex Luthor. Iron Man is simply more complex as a character then anything else you'll see in a summer film but it loses none of the spark or none of the pure popcorn fun. How many other films can you say that about? Stark's vulnerability is very much on display here as his personal life crumbles through various unique conflicts. He has to struggle with the government for control of his armor and deal with his growing celebrity. At the same time his personal life takes a turn as a love triangle emerges. He (like soon all of America) becomes attracted to his new aide (the lovely Scarlett Johansson), causing tension with his former assistant but now new Stark Industries CEO Pepper Potts (the also lovely Gwyneth Paltrow). They manage to pull all this off remarkably well and still leave character time for Rhodey and the villains. It's a believable sci-fi story featuring an intellect story that's wild but has the right amount of humor, angst and drama. Like I remember about Iron Man 1, I can't think of a weak moment in the film. The visual effects are incredible. They did the memory of their boss, the great Stan Winston, proud. They set the bar high again. Now the only question is whether they have anything left in the tank for Iron Man 3? I'm betting that they do.",Null,27,53,28 April 2010
Knives Out," terrible
",This was a heavy-handed waste of time and waste of film. The cast look lost and the dialog literally gets on your nerves. Couldn't stand any of the characters and the overt messages were annoying as can be. Avoid this garbage if you can.,Null,3,11,15 February 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Superb! Fantastical but perfectly balanced by the time period and 'greatest generation' setting
","If there's one major element that truly sets this movie apart from any other standard 'solid' comic book movie, it is the way through which the director communicates the experience. We feel for Steve Rogers and fully embrace the character as we go along with him on this amazing ride. This movie isn't about comic book pulp or American propaganda but about a deep and meaningful story. The elements are fantastical but perfectly balanced by the time period and 'greatest generation' setting. This visual and emotional imagery is presented throughout the movie and provides the viewer with greater insight into the heroes AND villains. This one screams quality from the opening scene and screams fun all the way through.For those going into this flick expecting a lot of fun, prepare to enjoy-- although fun's not the only piece of this pie. In fact, I think all movie fans will be stunned at how many levels this movie delivers upon. This is a smart and surprisingly deep film that really delivers everything I wanted to see.",Null,126,237,21 July 2011
Justice League," Just Awful
","You can believe all the negative things being said about this movie. What's remarkable is that it's such a bad experience that it turns out to be the ultimate pallet cleanser. What I mean, all other movies you see after having to endure this awful film will seem less bad by comparison. I realized this while walking out of the 'Justice League' showing. It's a terrible movie in its own right but I found myself saying, 'At least it wasn't as awful as BvS.' That's not a joke or an over-exaggeration in any way. Walking out of BvS was like getting punched in the gut. With this mess, all you'll feel is let down. Maybe a bit cheated, disappointed and even a bit lost but not really angry.Judging by the ratings here and a few critics that I read, I was expecting at least a decent film. These are all blind fanboy reviews or fake as CNN journalism.I want to thank the creators of this film. It single handedly sets up better experiences for the rest of the year because nothing could possibly be worse then this movie.",Null,9,20,16 November 2017
Shrek Forever After," jumped the Shrek and the Shark ... terrible
","Shrek is back for his fourth and hopefully last run and there's no plot, no story and none of the great little one liners or wink to the older crowd jokes we have enjoyed with the previous Shrek films. With everything Pixar can deliver nowadays, do we really need to try and squeeze blood from a franchise like this one? If Shrek 3 didn't pull it off than this one certainly has... This movie has jumped the Shrek and the Shark. Want a movie that is chalked filled with jokes that fall flat? Go see Shrek 4never.Ever wonder why Hollywood is rebooting everything and spinning off bad TV shows? Well, they're clearly out of good ideas. More proof is green-lighting a fourth Shrek movie that's this bad. There's no way you can tell me that any studio exec read the treatment for this animated turd and thought it was a good idea for an entertaining film. They simply crunched the money numbers and ordered the standard grab for the wallet. Too bad I fell for it like a lot of people probably will. When will I learn my lesson?",Null,28,60,22 May 2010
Friends with Benefits," unconscionably smug movie with annoying characters
","This is an unconscionably smug movie. Smug characters. Smug tone. Smug subject matter, and smug condescension towards its audience. It's infatuated with its own cleverness, staring adoringly at the rampant cynicism that propels it. Certainly, there's nothing wrong with cynicism, but every single character seems like an annoying caricature. After the first hour, it really starts to grate on the nerves. Sure, the leads are pleasant to look at for each of the sexes but Milia's part is all tease for the viewer. It's a sex comedy without the T & A payoff and that only adds to the frustration and my contempt for this horrible horrible movie going experience. No one else needs waste money on this film to experience what I had to endure.",Null,7,20,21 July 2011
Hacksaw Ridge," Awesome Film
","Superb storytelling surrounding the true tale of what turned out to be amazing courage. Mel Gibson just flat out knows how to make great movies. The cast was amazing and Andrew Garfield delivers what should be an award winning performance. The movie really connects on an emotional level and that is its number one strength. Could have used a more faith based context and more depth in to why Army Medic Desmond T. Doss felt the way that he did. I loved the true life interviews spliced in at the end to give resolution and even validation to the movie itself. Everyone should see this movie, period.",Null,3,7,9 November 2016
