The Monuments Men," A Pathetic and Self-Indulgent Piece of Nonsense
","Having read the original book from which 'Monuments Men' is taken, I was very interested to see the movie. There is a really fascinating and historically important story here, and it could have made a great film. However, soon after the show begins, it all starts to fall apart. The reason? George Clooney. He directed, and he wrote the screenplay. It's amazingly obvious that in neither of these capacities does Clooney know what he is doing. The screenplay is an absolute joke, totally disjointed, disconnected, silly, trite, and incredibly amateurish for a major Hollywood star of Clooney's stature. The same goes for the directing. George Clooney is obviously a guy with a huge ego, capable of fooling himself and a lot of other people who should know better, that he knows what he is doing. Film-making schools should show this movie as a classic example of what not to do. It's fundamentally flawed in every respect. Editing, music, etc.------one is taken aback by the unbelievable ineptness. Co-stars Matt Damon and Bill Murray and John Goodman and the rest of the cast merely parrot their lines in strange, disjointed scenes that beg to be rewritten by someone with a brain in his head. On the one hand, I totally condemn this piece of Hollywood egotistical stupidity, but on the other I heartily recommend it as an example of how bad movies can get in the hands of people with enormous egos. Stick to acting, Clooney---for God's sake don't direct and write screenplays ever again.",1,170,267,16 February 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Tarentino's WORST Movie Ever
","I didn't go see Inglorious Basterds when it first came out. Although I'm a fan of other Tarentino movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs,and Kill Bill----and think Jackie Brown was totally brilliant ---- the promotion and the trailer to Quentin's first war movie just didn't grab me. Now that I've finally gotten around to seeing it---- it's definitely two thumbs down. This is not only Tarentino's worst movie ever, it is also one of the all-time worst movies. It doesn't take you long to see that the plot is just a hash-job remake of 'The DIrty Dozen' and 'Where Eagles Dare' and some other famous war flicks. It's the old 'Select-team-penetrates-Nazi-headquarters-in- disguise-and-wipes-the-enemy-out' cliché. There's really nothing really new here at all except the level of violence. Even the foreign dialogue with subtitles has been done many times before. All that happens is that Tarentino basically just throws the cast into a big stage set like a puppet-master, and regurgitates his own standard clichés. It has the usual amount of extremely gratuitous violence thrown into your face at regular intervals. It has the usual number of bizarre, sadistic, disturbed, twisted, and otherwise bent or unconventional characters. It has shocking twists in the plot when you least expect it. But that's all you get. Tarentino fails to to give us something unique, like he can do when he's really on. The basic problem is the script, which is the weakest he has ever written. The plot is just plain silly and pointless, and could have been so much stronger and interesting. There are long tedious scenes with reams of dialogue that just take up time and go nowhere, unlike his earlier productions, where dialogue is original, razor-sharp, riveting, totally unpredictable, and powerful. There are no performances that reach the level of Samuel Jackson, John Travolta, Pam Grier, Uma Thurmann, Robert DeNiro etc. in past productions. Brad Pitt is basically just hamming it up, and is ultimately disappointing. The same goes for the rest of the cast. That's because Tarentino's usual gift for characterization is only partially evident. This movie could have been so much better. It's disjointed, self-indulgent, and ultimately boring. I never thought Tarentino could make such a total loser. I hope he gets back on track with his next one.",1,4,9,1 June 2012
The Killing Fields," A Very Great Film, Gets Better WIth Time
","I first saw The Killing Fields when it came out. I recall watching it on the big screen and being totally enthralled and impressed. Everything about it has the ring of reality, with a gripping sense of the brutality and evil of war. I think the sequence in which the journalists are arrested by the Khmer Rouge is one of the greatest moments in film history. The brilliant soundtrack that sets the mood as are they held hostage, while Prahn pleads and bargains for their lives, is perfect. You feel as though you are right there with these men as they experience desperation amid the shocking violence of war. The palpable mood of gut-wrenching fear and tension that the actors project goes far beyond the standard Hollywood fare. This movie is a subtle collage of sound, sights, and emotion that is very rare. The cast is uniformly excellent, and in technical terms the direction,cinematography,editing, soundtrack, sets and screenplay are as good as it gets. It should have won Best Picture as far as I am concerned. Haing S. Ngor deserved his Oscar, and Sam Waterston should have won Best Actor too. This is an incredible story and an incredible movie. Too bad they don't make more like it. I've seen it many times over the years and it gets better with time. It's a masterpiece.",10,6,7,20 September 2009
JFK," JFK Is a BIg Fat Lie And A Piece Of Cinematic Trash
","It is amazing to me how many continue to believe that Oliver Stone's movie is somehow the truth behind the Kennedy assassination. Obviously a lot of people are easily fooled, and Stone has made a masterpiece of outright exploitation. He is laughing all the way to the bank. But the actual truth is, this movie is a Big Fat Lie and a piece of total cinematic trash. All the actors who took part in it and helped build up the conspiracy theory are also guilty of aiding and abetting total fraud. Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, and was 100% guilty. No one else was involved, folks!! Sorry but that's all there is to it!! If you want to go on being sucked in by all the conspiracy hucksters who are cheating a lot of people out of their money, then that's your choice. My respect for Oliver Stone as a serious film-maker went totally down the tubes after he came up with JFK. The same for Kevin Costner. It's pure, total BUNK!! It would have been far better to tell the story based on the real facts, and portray Oswald as the total psychopath that he was. Maybe someday some brave director will do it, because it will make a far more interesting, compelling, and factual movie than this piece of trash.",1,21,61,5 October 2009
