United 93," This is not art, this is storytelling.
","As six billion people in the world conduct their daily duties, a handful of Muslim extremists are carrying out their last prayers before they cause one of the most infamous cataclysmic events in recent world history.Regardless of your views toward the subject matter, Mr. Greengrass chronicles the stories of United Airlines' Flight 93 with undeniable skill in his craftsmanship. The product of his efforts (and those of the brilliant cast and crew) is United 93, a gritty and blatantly created film that attempts solely to tell its story, rather than rely on the rules and tricks of Hollywood to draw massive sums of cash into the studio's coffers. The director has definitely surpassed his Bourne installments (terrific popcorn flicks notwithstanding) and showed the utmost respect for the victims of the United 93 crash--including the Muslim hijackers, drawn into the horrific business through extensive manipulation.As I noted before, the cast is superb, as various emotions display on their faces with perfect precision. It isn't long before the viewer is sucked into the reality of the story, and cares for each passenger. Stereotypes are not used, in contrast to entertainment pieces like Air Force One in which there are distinct heroes, villains, cowards, damsels in distress, etcetera.Though you know the depressing outcome of the fateful hijacking, you still root for the passengers to stop their oppressors. Visual junkies will be respectfully denied your doses of TNT and green screen, the only explosions here are through news footage of the tower's collapses.And, as I comfort myself with a viewing of Men in Black after seeing this, I warn you that United 93 is not an easy sitting. Some less resilient moviegoers will be sobbing in your respective fetal positions by the film's climactic final seconds, and most of you will feel compelled to keep the DVD in your player until the credits stop rolling.I can't see a purpose to rate this film. It was not created for the sake of artistic creativity, but to tell the story of United 93 with accurate juxtaposition to the actual predicament.",Null,2,3,5 December 2009
War of the Worlds," A modern and underrated sci-fi thriller.
","I'll never understand just why some people don't like this film.You say that the visual effects distract and leave a hollow story, but, while the effects are not used sparingly, they are very necessary to tell the modern-day adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel.In addition to top-notch cinematography, make-up, score, and one beautiful car, Steven Spielberg experiments with camera views and movements. After reading this comment, kindly watch the film--closely at the car ride after Ray's neighborhood is torn to pieces. You may notice that the entire scene is one take. The distressing family is seen through the car windows as the camera weaves through unmoving traffic. You also see many of the most dramatic or thrilling scenes through a reflection or the screen of a video camera. (note: tiny spoiler) In the first scene where the viewer sees one of the tripods, you watch the entire front portion of a church be carried away by the moving earth. It is visually interesting as you watch a ray of light shine through the steeple's window.And, for god's sake people, Morgan Freeman narrates the thing! It's a real treat to hear him give the first lines of the classic book at the beginning of the movie.Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning also develop a convincing on-screen bond.Conclusion: 8/10",8,2,5,7 April 2009
Casino Royale," Martin Campbell brings us a satisfying reboot; this is how Bond is meant to be seen.
","Bond movies are at the core of the action film genre. Not only is this series the most financially successful of all time, but the films appeal to nearly every generation. Make no mistake, though; Casino Royale abandons the cheesy and light-hearted demeanor of its predecessors and instead focuses on an in-depth analysis of Bond's beginnings... including one hell of a poker game.This installment begins with a summing-up of Bond's first two kills to achieve his '00' status. Here, we begin to realize that Bond will be displayed as a far more vulnerable and deep character. At the helm of the most difficult role in 007 history is Daniel Craig, who proves that he is a formidable addition to the cavalcade of actors chosen for Bond. It soon becomes apparent that we'll be seeing more of him in the series. Eva Green is introduced as Vesper Lynd. This is interesting. If you watch this movie expecting a beautiful broad with a name you can't say twice on television, you're only partially correct. Vesper features an individualism only seen in such roles as Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore, and 'Agent Triple X' in the Spy Who Loved Me. Bond succumbs to Lynd's beauty and impeccable character which has faint reminders of... Bond himself. They ultimately fall in love when Lynd has 'stripped Bond of his armor.' Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the result from this relationship is the Bond we've all come to know and love over the 50+ years since his initial birth in Ian Fleming's legendary series.Aside from our leads, Mads Mikkelson gives a great performance as the lead villain, Le Chiffre. This particular megalomaniacal genius has an unfailing ability to calculate the odds in a poker match, and--thank God--he's physically deformed! Le Chiffre has a scar over his eye (reminds me of Donald Pleasance's Blofeld) and weeps blood. Judi Dench returns to the role of M. A feature of this reboot is the development in Bond and his superior's relationship, which is one of the many differences from Bernard Lee's character.Casino Royale has small and satisfying reminders of Bonds long past; such as the gun barrel intro, the best opening credit sequence since 'Live and Let Die,' 007's famous 'Bond, James Bond' line, Felix Lester (Jeffrey Wright is excellent here), and a couple of snappy comebacks.It's almost insulting to call this and action movie. In the action genre we see henchmen firing machine guns at the hero/heroine when no bullet actually hits, and features melodramatic acting with a terrible script. Casino Royale is the polar opposite.I've fallen for every aspect of Casino Royale. A must see for every Bond fan, I give it a well-deserved 9/10.",9,3,5,19 May 2009
