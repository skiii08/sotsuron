United 93," Sure it is not bad....
","The problem with this movie is not it's pace, not it's factual or documentary-like nature, not the movie director's interpretation of the events, but the general angst the director has to turn this fragile subject into a movie. Of course 9/11 was one of the most dreaded days in history, but only because of the tremendous media exposure and multiple-angular shots of the scene. The day Bush started the war in Iraq was a day sentencing more people to death then any other day in American history, and that is the controversial side this movie doesn't tackle. Therefore it gives no more than a shallow depiction of the events, rather than an in depth investigative movie. I am also afraid this is going to fuel nothing but sentiment and no discussion whatsoever",6,1,5,27 June 2006
