The Blair Witch Project," Wow.
","I honestly don't know what to say about this film. So why am I writing, you ask? Because this film is possibly the best one I have seen in years. It is confusing, jaded, jarring, thrilling, and mystifying. The acting is superb, the production even better. Even an experienced film student walks away from The Blair Witch Project unsure of the true nature of the images on the screen. The barrier between fiction and non-fiction is truly tampered and disguised. And after much debate with many skeptics and cynics and filmmakers, I can only say that the only conclusion we have reached is that if it is crafted fiction - it is a supreme example of how a filmmaker can control sight and sound. And, of course, if it is non-fiction...See it. It charmed and scared me.",8,1,1,2 August 1999
8 Mile," The Eminem Show
","Wow, who knew that Eminem was so darn great? He's a hero, a fighter, a lover, a talent, a prodigy, is envied and adored by his neighbourhood, and is just about the coolest guy around... Gee. He's practically a messiah.It takes some kind of ego to make a film like this. Eminem's 'based on a true story' autobiography is written like a band's promotional bio, and comes off as terrific propaganda. The guy makes himself out to be the greatest common-man's hero since Atticus, and tops it off by giving himself Herculean qualities of strength, reserve, smarts, and let's not forget he's the greatest rapper ever... Oh yeh, and everyone around him is useless and just wants to be near him or loving him. My hero... (sigh...)Anyway, if you can get past the ego-polishing, 8 Mile is a good bit of entertainment. The movie gives a great view of the struggles of underground artists, particularly musicians just waiting for their 'break.' I like the message too, and despite all the negative imagery and events, the true moral of the film will sink in with kids: work hard, keep at it, and you just might succeed.",8,0,0,6 August 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," rocks
","I have reservations about awarding such a violent, brutal, obviously offensive, irresponsible production a 10/10. I thought I'd seen enough women viciously beaten and/or raped in popular film over the last few decades, but I guess I was wrong. And, oh yes, the women are violent themselves... I suppose that's some sort of excuse.However, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. It incorporates everything proven enjoyable by film history. It is Natural Born Killers meets The Empire Strikes Back meets Crouching Tiger meets Enter The Dragon meets The Crow meets a lot of other shiny recent movies that take the concept of 'aesthetic' pleasure to a whole new level.Everybody rocked. Everything rocks.",10,0,1,12 November 2003
