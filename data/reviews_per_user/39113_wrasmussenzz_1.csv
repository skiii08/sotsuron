Scarface," Pacino Classic
","Scarface is a movie that I am never failed to be entertained by. This movie is probably one of the best action and crime drama movies I've seen ever.As the story in the movie goes as Al Pacino playing Tony Montana who is a Cuban refugee coming in during the Mariel boatlift. This is a classic movie worth watching. I can't see a remake being made to this movie nor can I can see any other actor playing Tony Montana besides Al Pacino. The action scenes in this movie are just great as the shoouts and fights as well. Anyone who likes action, thrillers and crime dramas, this is a film worth watching.",10,0,2,2 January 2013
