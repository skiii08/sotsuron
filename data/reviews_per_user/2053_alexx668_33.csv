Vertigo," Vertigo
","Hitchcock was on a roll during that period. Vertigo is one of his most celebrated films, even though it's modeled after Rebecca in that it's 3 films rolled into one: a love story, a metaphysical thriller, and a suspense drama. Nevertheless, the difference between the Hitchcock of 1940 and the Hitchcock of 1958 is vast. The Hitchcock of Vertigo is a much more elaborate director, that dwells on the human psyche to fill the canvas. The human psyche is the protagonist, the suspense is just the background, or even a detail. Vertigo is a major work and an essay on neurosis and repressed desire.The plot: John Ferguson is a retired detective suffering from acrophobia. A rich old friend (Gavin Elster) hires him to investigate the activities of his wife (Madeleine), who he believes is being possessed by the spirit of a dead ancestor (Carlotta Valdes). After seeing Madeleine, Ferguson agrees. Later on, we see that Madeleine half-lives in Carlotta Valdes' house, spends a lot of time in front of a Carlotta painting in a museum, and generally models her behaviour after Carlotta. Also, Madeleine suffers from blackouts, during which she isn't in control of herself. Ferguson forms a relationship with her. He then pressures her to get rid of the past by dwelling on it, visiting places where Carlotta lived etc. During such a visit, and in the same day Carlotta died, Madeleine commits suicide by falling from the bell-tower of a chapel. Ferguson is unable to rescue her due to his acrophobia.Following this, Ferguson is placed in a mental hospital, suffering from catatonic depression. After some time, we find Ferguson released from the mental institution and in better shape. He then meets a woman who looks a lot like Madeleine. Nevertheless, the woman, Judy Barton, seems less perfect and more vulgar than Madeleine. Ferguson forms a relationship with her, and is trying to model her after Madeleine, buying her the same clothes etc. But during one of their encounters, the truth is revealed due to Barton's carelessness. She used the same jewelry as Madeleine. Barton and Madeleine is the same woman. In truth, Madeleine/ Barton was a 'doppelganger' to Elster's wife. Elster hired her in order to kill his rich wife, and manipulated Ferguson's illness so that he was a witness to the 'suicide'. It was the wife, and not Madeleine that fell from the tower.Unaware that Ferguson knows the truth, Barton continues the relationship and the 'transformation' to Madeleine. She now is in love with Ferguson, but Ferguson is intent on freeing himself from his acrophobia. As Barton is completely transformed to Madeleine, Ferguson takes her to the same chapel and to the bell tower. Forcing her up, she confesses the truth. She claims she is in love with him. She then sees a shadow emerging, panics and falls into the void. It turns out that the shadow was just a nun. Ferguson stands and watches from above. He is cured....This is not an easy film to analyze. It is very dense and has lots of hidden meaning beneath the surface. The most obvious theme is the one of fixation and impotence. Ferguson suffers from vertigo; Madeleine seems to be possessed by a dead spirit; Ferguson's friend Midge is in love with him but unable to express her love and conquer him; then when Madeleine dies Ferguson becomes obsessed with her.Madeleine represents the ideal love, perfection.In the meantime, there are some other interesting ideas floating in the background. One is that in the second half of the film we witness a reverse situation than that of the first half. In the first half, Elster and Madeleine manipulate Ferguson's impotence. In the second half, it is Ferguson that manipulates the less-than-perfect version of Madeleine (aka Barton), even though she regrets her accomplice and is genuinely in love with him.The ending, as well as the first half, is shrouded in the metaphysical and supernatural. The shadow that Madeleine/ Barton sees could be anything: a ghost, her guilt, Elster, the dark side of her relationship with Ferguson etc. Ferguson models Barton after Madeleine with almost necrophiliac obsession. Just before the second time that Madeleine 'dies', she and Ferguson kiss, representing the ephemeral happiness in vain. After she dies, Ferguson is freed from his impotence, but we don't know his feelings, we just see him watching from above. Basically Ferguson is haunted by his search for perfection (an ideal love, a god to believe in?). There is a clear parallel between that and his impotence (the vertigo). When he tries to transform the down-to-earth Barton to the perfect Madeleine, the illusion isn't working. In order to cure himself from the impotence, he kills her (he was the one that dragged her to the chapel).Moreover, what the film seems to project is the vortex of the human psyche. Both in the first and the second half, the conclusion is the same: the woman dies. It's the behaviour of the male protagonist alters dramatically. In the supernatural first half, the protagonist is crippled, while in the down-to-earth second half, he is more free but also less happy.The real moment Ferguson is freed is when he realizes the truth about Madeleine. Madeleine/ Barton is sitting in front of a mirror (representing the dual personality). Then Ferguson sees the jewel and immediately thinks of the portrait of Carlotta Valdes (a symbolism of the original sin? He and Madeleine had an adulterous affair after all). Vertigo projects the male-female relationship into the conflict between the human and the ideal (the supernatural, the belief in the perfect). But there is no way out. Both stories (the first and second half) are two sides of the same coin.",8,15,20,19 January 2007
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Who Framed Roger Rabbit
","This half-animation/ half-live-action tribute to the film-noir genre, crossed with the effervescent gag spirit of the old 'Looney Tunes' series, is good and enjoyable, but not as good as it's reputation would suggest. At the time there was lots of bragging about the 'revolutionary' mixing of animation and live-action, which is sort of mystifying, seeing as it was already done way back in the 40's with films like The Three Caballeros. Oh well, the manipulative force of the media at it again. On a side-note, Bob Hoskins is just marvelous as declined alcoholic detective Eddie Valiant, and Christopher Lloyd (of 'Back to the Future' fame) fits perfectly as the paranoid Judge Doom.",6,3,6,14 September 2009
Chinatown," Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown..
","Roman Polanski's neo-noir 'Chinatown' presents a nihilistic outlook on mankind. A cynical and detached private detective (specialist in extramarital affairs) deals with what seems a typical adultery case, which quickly turns to a complex affair that includes murder, political corruption, financial scandals, destroyed families and so on. The bleakness is pretty impressive.The detective himself ain't doing much better, unable to define between right and wrong, and also repeating the same mistakes he made in the past when he served in the police-force in Chinatown. And so it is, the ending brings him back to Chinatown, where his actions damn the people he's supposed to protect. However, it's his detachment which dominates; a cowardly submission to fate; a depression.The ending is great, aided by a moody jazzy soundtrack. On the downside, the plot at times seems forced, just so that Polanski gets his points across. But a tight brooding thriller all the same.",8,1,3,16 May 2006
The Birth of a Nation," Birth of a Nation..
","David W. Griffith's supposed masterpiece is actually one of the worst films ever made. 'Birth of a Nation' has the cinematic elegance of a documentary, and the innovation of a boring melodrama. In truth, this is the precursor to 'Gone With The Wind'. And as if that wasn't enough, it's completely racist presentation of the Negro slaves and glorification of the Ku-Klux-Klan (even if it's in the Recostruction period) push the film further into the abyss.When judged purely for it's directorial techniques, 'Birth of a Nation' amounts to a big zero; it's a boring action melodrama. But when judged for it's morals, 'Birth of a Nation' is subzero racist trash.",1,8,22,15 February 2005
Inglourious Basterds," Inglourious Tarantino..
","Typical Tarantino. A passable film which everybody hails as a masterpiece. But it isn't. The multi-narrative storyline starts out boring but turns out OK, and the ending is tense, with Tarantino borrowing from the cult kitsch B-movie to good effect. On the other hand, I wish Hollywood would stop dealing with the Nazis and the Holocaust. Enough is enough is enough! We know it happened, quadrillions other genocides happened throughout history too, without Hollywood making a billion films about them - akin to the effect of a brainwash. The stylized violence I also find unattractive. It's highly unrealistic and tends to make it look appealing, when in reality violence is the exact opposite.",6,7,17,10 October 2009
Batman Returns," Batman returns, should we care? Yes!
","More free to apply his personal vision when compared to the first Batman, Tim Burton turns the Batman mythos to a feverish stylized Gothic fairy-tale, on whose core lies poisonous cynicism and pessimism.Gotham City rots. It's business elite sinks in a ruthless corruption and manipulates the political system at will. It's citizens are scared and weak-minded pawns. Catwoman is basically a repressed and suppressed suburban housewife/ working-woman. Batman is a lone and slightly sad, but heroic, figure. The Penguin is ultimately the most tragic figure of all - a direct result of society's anthropophagy.Tim Burton sinks himself in this Gotham abyss, turning it to an almost attractive dÎ¹cor, whose heroes let themselves pinch and scrape.",8,1,2,27 September 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Hype, hype, hype..
","All over the world, the critics hailed 'Brokeback Mountain' as a masterpiece. Inevitably, the public hailed it as a masterpiece too. After all, It's not the first time that the public, literally brainwashed by the hype and relentless promotion around a certain title, follows blindly. Yes, human opinion is that easy to shape.It seems as if the Americans, or Western society in general, decided it was time for gay love stories to creep into the mainstream, but that doesn't make a good film. Remove the novelty of the gay cowboys love affair, and all that's left is a boring melodrama. Ang Lee's direction is the movie equivalent of a postcard, plastic and soulless. The film hardly says anything meaningful, it is merely the next 'thoughtful' blockbuster in a series that includes 'American Beauty', 'Truman Show', 'Schindler's List' etc.Basically everyone concentrates on the wrong points. This is far less interesting as a love story, and far more powerful as social commentary: the 2 men follow completely different lifestyles, one is a lower-class outcast, the other becomes a middle-class professional. The former is more bound to social conventions (even though ruined by the system), the latter not so much. Essentially, they are both hypocrites and losers, and especially Ennis (who is more amoral, though a bit of an idealist).",5,3,39,27 February 2006
Alien," The alien within?
","Despite it's legendary status, the truth is that Alien is just a horror movie set out in space, i.e. the alien monster taking the part of the serial killer that's murdering the cast one by one (minus of course the main character, in this case Ripley - played by Sigourney Weaver). So, nothing original, apart from that it's set in outer space.Then where does that leave us? Well, two things are really of note. H.R. Giger's design of the alien planet and the creature itself - chilling and nightmarish, in what is the brush of a true artist, and also Ash's poetic reflection on the alien monster: 'Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.' 'I admire its purity. A survivor.. unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.'And yet despite the atmospheric approach, it's unclear what angle or view, if any, the film offers. Seemingly it condemns the instinctive effort for survival of the alien creature, yet in the end it's the morally bound humankind which prevails. In fact, the scene in the end where Ripley comes face to face with the alien and kills it by shooting it in outer space is probably the film's center of gravity. The alien creature is for the first time looking insecure and scared of dying, but Ripley (guided by her own instincts) shows no remorse. Here, the roles of the hunter and the hunted are blurred, and so is the moral status of mankind.Other minor themes are the remorseless capitalist stance of the mother/company, which also hides a metaphysical meaning (the company is called mother, it controls the destiny of the crew, has it's own purposes, has it's chosen representative amongst the crew with the robot Ash etc).",6,17,34,17 June 2008
Shutter Island," Shutter society..
","For American standards, this is a relatively difficult film, with an elliptical narrative, 'dead' spaces, ornate direction, slow pacing, and so forth. It is also very uneven, tense and claustrophobic on one hand, but with lots of ups and downs on the other. At it's best, it is very intense, at it's worst, it is downright flat and predictable, and hardly helped by the anemic meaning.First things first. As a director, Scorsese is probably at his finest here, which is good. Compared to, say, Coppola, he is still evolving, which is the sign of a healthy artist. He is still not an auteur, but this is overall his best direction.Now, the little trick of having two realities warping around each other is borrowed by David Lynch, and is hardly causing any sort of sensation anymore. The ending with the lobotomy is also borrowed from Gilliam's 'Brazil', as is the whole message in general, that in turn is borrowed from Orwell's '1984'. The message here is that of a society evolving from the ghosts of a brutal World War II, that is seemingly democratic, but in reality authoritarian and artificial. The subtle references about McCarthyism are nice, but actually the whole message is rather vague, and in the end serves as a pretense for a claustrophobic existential thriller.",7,2,5,9 March 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Fellowship of the Ring
","Yet another parade of fantasy clichés can be found in the 1st part of Lord of the Rings, a hodgepodge of 'Neverending Story', 'Excalibur', 'Indiana Jones', 'Harry Potter', 'Goonies' etc.There is no denying that Peter Jackson is capable in directing fairy-tales, but sadly there's not much worthwhile here. Above all this is a triumph of digital effects, but in the end it's just too generic and boring.Apparently, to stay true to the epic nature nature of the book, the movie runs at 3 hours, overstaying it's welcome. This could be edited down to 2 hours and be more fun. It's not always a good idea to present an epic if you have nothing to say.",4,2,7,10 October 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," The Matrix mythos
","The bigger picture had already started taking shape in 'The Matrix Reloaded', but there were still doubts amidst the pile of narratives, and of course in the vortex of the hyper action. But it's obvious in 'The Matrix Revolutions'. The Matrix trilogy is a sci-fi retelling of the Christianity fable. Slightly heretic perhaps, but it's the Christianity fable all the same.Think about it. The Architect is God. He created the first perfect matrix which mankind rejected. Ring any bells? Yes, this is the original sin redux. Thereafter mankind lives in a kind of downgraded matrix that suits their needs and nature better. The agents/programs are God's angels so to speak. Neo, aka the saviour, might be another means of control, but he's the saviour nonetheless. Agent Smith is the angel that rebelled and freed himself; he's, ho-hum, an Antichrist of sorts.The difference in the Matrix's Weltanschauung is that mankind has rebelled against the Architect, aka God. Mankind (or at least a part of it) wants out the matrix, out of the role-model of god's universe altogether. It chooses to. Essentially the Matrix trilogy depicts mankind as some sort of anomaly (to use the film's terms), eternally bound to be in conflict with something without even really knowing why - the establishment, it's own emotions, whatever.The three films can thus be categorized as such: The first film is the introduction to the general idea and aesthetics. The second film is the culmination of the aesthetics, and the deviation and dilution of the idea into more interesting levels. The third film is the clearing up of the idea (and thus slightly disappointing), the decay of the overindulgent aesthetics, and the pompous pathos of the ultimate battle between Neo and Agent Smith.",6,2,3,20 February 2009
North by Northwest," North by Northwest
","One of the best Hitchcock films, 'North By Northwest' can be interpreted on many levels. On one hand this is a suspense extravaganza, with the plot featuring more twists and turns than a roller-coaster ride, and with some of the most impressive sequences ever, particularly the airplane scene and the chase at Mount Rushmore. This is impeccably shot, and it shows. Even the love affair between the 2 protagonists takes advantage of the settings, displaying irony and cynicism.On the other hand, as a character study this is even more interesting. Roger Thornhill, your average middle-class advertising executive leading a dull life, out of a twist of fate is mistaken for a government spy, and becomes the target for the criminal group of Phillip Vandamm. The film's intense pace takes the form of a dream, a person that loses control of his life and then transforms to the person he's mistaken for. Roger Thornhill, half by accident and half by his own will transforms to spy decoy George Kaplan.The board of government spy directors, led by the Professor, represents the forces that control destiny. They control both Eve Kendall's and Thornhill's fate. And they choose to dispatch with Thornhill altogether since he doesn't fit the general scheme of things. Thornhill gets entangled in a Kafka-esquire nightmare. Kendall, the femme fatale, is a government spy herself trying to uncover Vandamm by working closely on his side and being his lover. A Freudian labyrinth.Thornhill manages to be in charge of his own destiny, to the point where he gets to play a vital role to the people around him. The government now wants to use him, Eve Kendall falls in love with him but he also jeopardizes her mission, and ditto for Vandamm, now sure that Thornhill really is Kaplan. The surprising ending also contributes to the film's dream-like feel, with a sudden switch from a near-death scene to a generic happy ending. It can be translated two ways, either an ironic take on film endings, or Thornhill's fantasy. A fantasy within a fantasy.",8,0,0,28 December 2006
The Orphanage," Orphanage of ghosts..
","This horror-drama (produced by Guillermo del Toro) was OK, but nothing extraordinary. The direction was measured, without resorting to any excessive stylistic fiddling, apart from some color filtering (mild saturation mainly), and from the grotesque masks (a cliché) at the guest party. The storyline kept you on your seat, even though you probably guess what's going on, and even though it doesn't resist a few cheap horror moments (the car crash, for example). Overall, the implied overtone is of the heroine revisiting the repressed 'ghosts' of the past and making peace with them, but at a cost, since the ghosts 'engulf' her (which is why they were repressed in the first place).",6,2,3,6 June 2010
Quantum of Solace," Quantum Of Solace
","The new James Bond has it's pros and cons. On the pros side, Bond has never been so down to earth as in 'Quantum Of Solace'. This is the most political Bond yet, and dangerously political at that, what with the CIA co-operating with third-world dictators, criminal rings disguised as non-governmental organizations, profoundly cynical (almost nihilist) bureaus and so on.On the cons side, this is the less charming Bond yet. Is this even really Bond? There's no humour, no larger-than-life attitude, no exoticism, no goofy megalomaniac villains with zany plots to take over the world, no gadgets, no post-modern retro-futuristic settings etc.In other words, this is a complete departure from all Bond trademarks.But what kind of departure? Judged purely on it's filmic qualities, this is just a generic 00's action flick, set hot on the heels of 'Mission Impossible' and 'The Bourne Identity'. Daniel Craig is OK and rather a return to the style of Sean Connery (whereas Pierce Brosnan was a dead-ringer for Roger Moore) but the new direction for Bond seems wrong. What is needed is a revamp similar to the one that went on in the 70's when Moore took over.James Bond was always about style and 'Quantum Of Solace' has very little, if any, style.",6,3,5,20 November 2008
Hellboy," Hellboy..
","Hellboy, directed by Guillermo del Toro, is a lousy comic adaptation that retains none of the original spirit or atmosphere of the comic. Instead it is a show-off of digital effects and a parade of various clichés: digital hyper action a la 'Matrix', 'Aliens' monster-chase claustrophobia, 'Indiana Jones' lost-civilizations feelgood adventure, 'Batman' Gothic fantasy and so on. It even incorporates some boring romantic melodrama.Add some vague pseudo-philosophy and moral preaching about what is it that defines humanity, and you have one of the most overrated movies of 2004. As Hollywood fairy-tales come and go, this is one of the worst. But essentially, Hellboy is a video game and not a film.",4,1,3,7 August 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Bored with the rings..
","Peter Jackson achieved the impossible by making '2 Towers' even worse than 'Fellowship of the Ring'. By keeping the basic elements of 'Fellowship', i.e. dozens of fantasy clichés - from 'Excalibur' to 'The Neverending Story', and adding a large dose of Western, i.e. lots of boring combat sequences - Indians vs cowboys Middle-Earth style, and also soaking the film in slow motion melodramatic sequences.This a good definition of generic plastic Hollywood storytelling, a kitsch mix of 'Willow', 'Braveheart' and 'Titanic', which again lasts too long at 3 hours. Only the digital effects are of any interest, but this is a film and not a computer demo.",1,1,6,22 October 2005
Stardust," Fake stardust
","This movie doesn't quite know what it wants to be: a fairy-tale? A fantasy film? An adventure? A romance? A comedy? It's allover the place. Anyway, it's the comedic bits that stand out the most. There's quite a few laughs to be had here. The romance bits are typically emotive, but that's not so hard to accomplish. So let's demolish them. Imagine, if you will, that instead of a love story between cutie-face Charlie Cox and miss shinny star Claire Danes, you get one between Susan Boyle and Michael Moore. Ouch. That wouldn't be a fairy-tale but a Dardenne Bros film. On the direction front, the CGI range from quite decent, to casual and impromptu.",6,0,7,1 February 2011
The Game," Game over
","What really sets 'The Game' apart is the metaphysical undercurrent. As a mystery action-thriller, it's great, full of plot-twists and tension. As the game that central-character, Nicholas Van Orton, was offered unfolds, and prank after elaborate prank turns to deadly ambiguous reality, Nicholas loses control of his life but also finds himself as the traveler in a Danteesque hell.The metaphysical meaning is this: the whole experience works as some sort of purgatory for Nicholas, who gets a chance to redeem himself of his sins (him being a ruthless capitalist businessman and alienated from pretty much everyone around him). At the start of the game, the mysterious organization company CRS (a sort of god, though in the end guided by the mere mortal players' wishes) evaluates Nicholas and his abilities, so that it organizes the perfect experience for him. At the apex of the game, and when Nicholas loses his money, he is being left for dead in a cemetery in Mexico. He metaphorically dies and is reborn a changed man.The director, David Fincher (of 'Seven' and 'Fight-Club' fame) obviously had a ball filming this.",8,4,6,13 July 2008
World Trade Center," World Trade whatever..
","One would expect some more thoughtful commentary on the 11/9 terrorist attacks from the director of 'Wall Street' and 'Natural Born Killers'. Instead what we get is some generic melodrama, replete with slow-motion sequences, along with the usual strings accompaniment.There's not much to comment here, the only barely nice scene was the one that showed the policemen buried, with the camera then moving slowly to the top of the ruins. This kind of stuff might be nice to arouse patriotic feeling, but a good film it doesn't make. Nicolas Cage's performance bordered on parody as well (the tough cop sergeant).Oliver Stone is digging his own grave with films like this and 'Alexander'.",3,3,6,19 January 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: a metaphysical odyssey
","Arthur Clarke's philosophy, i.e. man's pursuit of his destiny in the stars, turns to a metaphysical credo. In the end, the traveler of space literally turns to a star-child, a new entity freed from the fetters of flesh.Used as a vehicle for this ambitious esprit-de-corps, Stanley Kubrick's intensely anti-commercial direction seems as though suspended in the void of outer space, almost filmed in slow-motion amidst abstract pictures, culminating in the 'psychedelic' journey in the end of the film.An extremely uncommercial film, which is puzzling how it became so popular.",9,1,5,1 August 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind..
","'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', one of the most overrated films of recent years, is mostly a parable about how humans should accept their destiny instead of escaping it. But while the general meaning is fairly simple, the script is complex, using a non-linear narrative (a la 'Lost Highway' or 'Memento'), confusing past and present, dream and reality, the lives of the main characters etc.The direction further enhances this elaborate scheme: there are cut-ups, special effects, imaginative montage techniques, but also a post-modern overlapping between genres. Thus the film is sometimes a lyrical love-story, at other times a comedy, realist drama, Freudian analysis and so on. Unfortunately, a big part of the movie resorts to Hollywood melodrama (complete with generic sentimental soundtrack music). It feels as if the director is mostly interested in showing off his skills rather than presenting an interesting and organic movie. Vastly inferior to the similar 'L'Appartement' (1996, Gilles Mimouni).",6,6,13,27 July 2005
Avatar," Avatar
","Usually it happens, with films that introduce some technical innovation, that the fascination only lasts for as long as the next technical innovation appears. In Avatar, it doesn't even last that long. Once your eyes get used to the crispy images and colours, you realize that this is really only a cartoon on high-definition.So on to the film. This is pretty much the Conquistadores versus the American-natives allover again.So on to whatever ideas are to be found here.I am willing to indulge the whole philosophy that nature acts as some sort of network and that we should interact harmoniously with it. It's just that the whole idea is leaking in the sense that in a nature that works in a Darwinian framework, it doesn't make much difference if the hunter respects the prey, or if a species is becoming extinct due to extraneous factors. Nature is chaos and you can find all sorts of excuses to justify chaos, or learn to live with it. But it's still chaos, and chaos has no sentiment.The last part of the film is 'Rambo' and 'Aliens' allover again, and to be honest, no matter how advanced the computer graphics are, this is less impressive than Cameron's past adventures.",7,3,7,16 January 2010
The Descent," The Descent
","Ostensibly, 'The Descent' is a fairly formulaic horror film where the entire cast gets slaughtered one-by-one by a group of killers. The visions and premonitions of protagonist Sarah are basic horror fodder as well, though they provide us with a brilliant ending-sequence where the vision of her daughter and the reality of her being trapped in the cave mesh in a stylish way. Nevertheless, this standard horror film works well because of the twisted psychological framework that exists in the background.By descending into the cave, symbolically the group of heroines descends into the subconscious, to find mankind's menacing prehistory lingering in the shadows. As the group of primitive cavemen attacks them, the facade of civilization and friendship dissolves, and symbolically these two conditions (conscious and subconscious, prehistory and present) mesh and interweave, to the point where the killer creatures are distorted mirror-images of the main cast.There's plenty of garish horror and gore, but director Neil Marshall has a few visual aces up his sleeve with the threatening night-vision shots (acting as glimpses into the subconscious) amidst piles of bones and with the creatures lurking in the background.",7,0,1,24 September 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," It's the end of the world as we know it.
","'Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire' is more of the same, ie it bears no difference at all with all previous Harry Potters. But was it an original recipe in the first place ? Hell, no. This is basically 'Wizard of Oz' adapted for the age of Playstation, 'Labyrinth' on steroids, 'Neverending Story' on a high budget and produced by Steven Spielberg etc etc. In fact there's only one quasi-progression and that is a large dose of generic melodrama, as our young heroes approach teenhood and discover love. Cue dramatic strings. A meaningless and uneventful remake of Wizards & Warriors crossed with 'Gone with the Wind' that deserves to go by unnoticed. Save your money.",4,0,0,30 December 2005
Inception," Inception? No, implementation.
","'What's the most resilient parasite? An idea. A single idea from the human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules. Which is why I have to steal it.' That is the motto of 'Inception'. It is a very intriguing idea in itself, but one which the film only goes superficially to explore. To cover for this superficiality, the plot is given a superficially complex guise, but actually it's pretty straightforward.Leonardo DiCaprio and his team invade people's dreams to steal information from their subconscious. However, their new mission in 'Inception' is not to steal information, bur rather to 'plant' it, therefore causing the inception of a new idea in the target's subconscious. To do this, they form dreams within dreams (which in the film actually work as three separate dreams rather than actual dreams within dreams), therefore accessing a more vulnerable form of the target's subconscious.For some reason (which the film doesn't adequately explain) within the dream there is a symbol of the subconscious motive (say, a safe) whereas you can find the desired information, or whereas you can plant the desired information. But there's a catch. If for some reason you 'die' in a dream within a dream, you remain in subconscious limbo (which again is not adequately explained) which nevertheless can resemble a form of reality in itself.Amidst all that, Christopher Nolan makes an action film, with car chases, gunshots etc etc.Here is the thing with Nolan. As a director he only offers intrigue. He approaches an ambitious idea, touches the surface of it, but then hesitates to proceed any further, and reverts to the action film prototype. Furthermore, he has done it so many times already, that even the action segments look pompous and clichéd (too much reliance on editing and warping of real time).This is a confused film, which tries to hide it's inadequacies in a needlessly confusing plot.Once again with a Nolan film, ambiguity prevails. When DiCaprio and his wife are stuck in subconscious limbo, the wife 'locks' the idea of doubting an objective reality, and throws away the key. DiCaprio invades her subconscious and replants the idea, thus when they re-enter real life the idea remains. But the idea was there in the first place, wasn't it? The sub-plot with Robert Fischer is stated in such a way so that it impresses with it's artificial 'complexity' (in the first 'layer' of dream, DiCaprio's team plant seeds of doubt; in the second layer of dream they direct Fischer into facing this doubt; and in the third layer of dream he faces it, duh), but it is suggested that the seeds of Fischer's discomfort were already rooted in real life, with DiCaprio's team merely fast-forwarding them (hence ambiguity again). The icing on the cake is we never learn whether DiCaprio has returned to real life or not (ambiguity).What a mess. The only thing this multiple dream architecture serves is that it spices up what is essentially a simple plot: that somebody enters someone's dream in order to plant an idea. That's all there is to it.As it is, ambiguity characterizes Christopher Nolan very nicely, as he seems eternally torn between the commercial action film and.. something else (without that 'something else' ever taking shape). Nolan must stop hinting at a grander scope and actually embrace it.",7,6,9,23 January 2011
Blade Runner," Blade Runner..
","Blade Runner, more than a simple science-fiction film, works on three different levels:a. On one level this is a futuristic film-noir. The protagonist consumed by his past, the femme fatale, the urban nightmarish city etc. All elements of the noir archetype.b. On a second level this is an expressionist film that presents a dystopian vision of the urban metropolis and dehumanized society, but also unfolds the plot in elegant theatric images.c. On a third level this is a philosophical essay on man, god and life. Much credit for this must go to Philip K.Dick, whose novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' this is an adaptation of, but also to Hampton Fancher and David Peoples that wrote the script, as well as the cinematography of Jordan Cronenwet.Still, it is Ridley Scott's masterly direction that glues the whole film together, which is a bit of surprising when considering some of the drivel he's produced over the years ('GI Jane', 'Gladiator' etc).",9,0,1,11 May 2005
Casino Royale," Reinvention?
","Let's consider for a moment what happened here. The producers of James Bond bet in favour of a reinvention of sorts. Out goes Pierce Brosnan, in comes Daniel Craig. So far, so good.In simple terms this reinvention meant that the humour, camp and flamboyance got thrown out of the window, and the formula of the generic modern masculine action-film was applied instead (a la 'Mission Impossible' and the 'Bourne' films). The public responded, the critics declared the film a success.For the next bond film, 'Quantum of Solace', the producers thought they should repeat the formula of the modern-day hyper-action film. And why not? After all both public and critics had agreed that the 'reinvention' of 'Casino Royale' was well worthwhile. And guess what. 'Quantum of Solace' received a lukewarm reception because.. it had strained too much from the traditional 'cool' and cosmopolitan Bond formula.What does that tell you?",4,4,6,23 January 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Nightmare on Elm Street
","'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is, more or less, a pretty formulaic horror film in the sense that there's a killer on the loose who's murdering the cast one by one. Been there, done that etc. Stylistically-wise it's a so-so affair as well, with some of the horror sequences and effects being cheesy and others being nicely-made and well thought out. However it works quite effectively where other horror films only hint at: the killer as a symbol for sexual desire.As soon as the teenage cast becomes sexually active, whoosh, there comes the deformed monster Freddy Krueger (in their dreams of all places) to deal with them. Furthermore, their parents refuse to acknowledge the existence of Freddy (aka sexual libido), though Nancy's mother eventually admits to coming face to face with him in the past and killing him. It is also worth noting that the females (Nancy and Tina) both go on in their dreams looking for Freddy, whereas the males (Rod and Glen) seem oblivious to his existence and are much more easily murdered.'A Nightmare on Elm Street' adds this twisted psychological framework in the background and that is why it's a worthwhile film to watch.",7,0,1,24 September 2008
300," David faces Goliath, and loses, because the world is bad..
","I'll start by saying I didn't have high expectations of this. I had read the comic and it was mediocre. Frank Miller was a great comic creator in the 80s, but in decline ever since. Nevertheless this film adaptation of '300' is fairly decent, and a nice break from all the recent warrior borefests ('Troy', 'Alexander', 'Lord Of The Rings').There are good reasons for this. The heavily stylized direction gives the whole thing a distinct fairy-tale-y vibe. This is almost a cartoon, but in a good, atmospheric way. In truth there is very little to set it apart from the comic, but it works anyway.Then there are the nice little touches to the plot. They play a secondary role but it's these that distinguish the film. The co-operation between the corrupted priests and politicians might be a stereotype, but still very powerful. Maybe cause it rings so true. Also the quest for perfection in ancient Sparta, but at the expense of the weak.Then in perhaps the most memorable scene of the film, the traitor Efialtes is being promised undreamed of pleasures by the almost hermaphrodite-like Xerxes, surrounded by an orgy of deformed lesbians and alien rituals. For a mainstream film, this sequence is very daring.But alas, we still have to go through endless battles (albeit shot in style, almost choreographed), boring demagogue about bravery and patriotism, and too much melodrama (check the scene where some soldier hands Leonidas' wife some medallion, and she in turn hands it predictably to her son). All garnished with the appropriate larger-than-life orchestral score.But hey, it's watchable. Who would've thought.",6,2,4,15 May 2007
Sin City," Sin City
","When Frank Miller started doing Sin City the comic, he was already past his prime. Gone was the political paranoia in favour of big drama. His comic work was always what you'd call cinematic, anyhow, so no surprises that they turned this to a movie. The problem is that what you'd see in the comic and think it was OK, say, a comic rendition of a slow motion scene culminating in a big one-page drawing, in the movie it works the opposite way: it exposes it for the cinematic cliché that it is. Essentially this is a quasi-cartoon tribute to film noir, too reliant on dramatic bombast. Frank Miller should take a look back to his roots (Ronin, Elektra Assassin, The Dark Knight Returns) in case he rediscovers what it was that made him special in the comic universe.",5,1,4,21 August 2009
Gangs of New York," Violence..
","Surprisinsly, when considering that this came late in his career, and also that Scorseze is generally overrated, Gangs Of New York is a vital film. Less a historical tribute, this is more of a sociological essay on the mechanisms of control and power, occasionally reaching philosophical levels in it's pondering on human society, politics and religion. A touch of stylized violence and an excellent performance by Daniel-Day Lewis, as opposed to the mediocre Leonardo DiCaprio, also help elevate the film. The ending sequence is perhaps the most poignant of all, showing modern-day New York (representing the modern world in general) being built upon the foundations of old gangland New York, aka symbolically the age-old mechanisms of oppression and brainwashing applied by the state to pursue it's own means.",8,0,2,23 March 2006
Contact," Contact
","'Contact' is an interesting film, which primarily isn't about whether we're alone in space or not. Mostly it seems to examine and contrast three distinct types of personalities: the idealist scientist (Eleanor Arroway), the religious believer (Palmer Joss) and the logical strategist/ manipulator (David Drumlin or Michael Kitz). The film bridges the first two types (in the end Arroway's motivation is driven purely by faith, while Joss' faith reaches beyond religion), while the third type is the one that's really in control of mankind's destiny (the manipulative Drumlin gets the mission initially, while the cold logic of Kitz and co demands they cover up what really happened).Philosophically-wise, the film goes for a kind of expanding and 'exterior' way of thinking. When Arroway meets the aliens (mind, in the guise of her dead father) they reveal that there are many civilizations in the universe etc but that mankind (in their own words capable of beautiful dreams and horrible nightmares, and always feeling void and alone) must find it's own way and in 'slow moves'. Also, they reveal that 'the only thing that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other'.The film is rather tame and fairly predictable in it's stand. When Arroway meets the aliens, she could be talking to God. Returning to Earth without any solid proof, she doesn't convince about what was essentially a religious experience. The film exhibits this bridging of science and religion with ridiculous amounts of melodrama, in the usual slow-motion emotional-exploitation sequences and mellifluous strings. Standing as some sort of middle-ground between '2001, A Space Odyssey' (man reaching for the outwards) and 'Solaris' (man delving in the inwards), the problem is that director Robert Zemeckis is neither a Stanley Kubrick nor an Andrey Tarkovsky.",6,15,23,23 August 2008
Jurassic Park," Jurassic Park
","There's a thing about films that are based excessively on special effects: they age quickly as the technology of special effects progresses. That's how it is with 'Jurassic Park', which made a sensation when it came out because of the special effects, but the same special-effects look painfully ordinary now.So, putting the effects aside, as a film this is pretty bad. In the first hour pretty much nothing happens, while the second hour is a series of chases (which get boring by the end). In the meantime the message is: god was wise to extinguish the dinosaurs, so how dare you bring them back? Which is the eternal paradox religion-believers find themselves in all the time. Because if god's axiom is the survival of the fittest, then moralistic values have no place in such an axiom.",5,3,11,25 October 2009
