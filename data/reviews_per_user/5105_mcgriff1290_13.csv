Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," This pirates movie must walk the plank
","The first pirates movie introduced us to something new that we haven't seen before and a great adventure set sail, the second got us off course of where we wanted to be taken and the third somehow lost its way along the strong tides of what audiences demanded. Now we are given this new pirates film that has some new things introduced, but falls off the edge of the world on its journey, killing the franchise and destroying the hope of something more in this series. This film lacks the fresh story like we were given in the first movie (likable characters, new story, and something that doesn't lose your interest). This movie is the complete opposite and it becomes a bore because the audience has seen all this before and becomes old real quick. The new cast brings nothing to the film to help its cause of being successful; very forgettable roles that are out shined by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. The first 30 to 60 minutes of this movie was OK, but after that it got confusing and started to lose its way during the story line jumping all over the place. Pointless scenes that serve no purpose, flat moments that lack Jack Sparrows presence, and not enough action/story to carry this movie along. It almost feels like some of the same pirates cast with new faces, but not the same likable pirates movie. It's also hard to realize that Disney wants to make two more of these. Disney just seems to want the name of the Pirates movie to become their cash cow without caring if the audience will be entertained or not. Disney is great at making animation movies that bring feeling to the audience, but when it comes to real life movies they make, they seem to always fall short of something enjoyable. This franchise had its day in the sun now it will be walking the plank if it continues.",Null,0,0,11 July 2011
Horrible Bosses," If you enjoy a good movie with a lot of comedy this movie is for you
","There have been a lot of R rated comedies coming out this year and are out shining the major title films such as Hangover 2. It seems that studios are making gamble trying to increase the number of slap stick comedies and reduced the number of actors that are always featured in them. Such as Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Will Ferral and other known actors that are featured more times than once in these types of films. Horrible Bosses grabbed my attention in the first few minutes of the opening sequence and from then on I was hooked. What Horrible Bosses has done is take what people are familiar with and have experience it most of their lives and shot it through a comedy out look and it's fun and relate able to watch. It's Office Space meets The Hangover type of comedy. This movie has a good story, but in this type of film it's not story the audience is looking for, it's comedy and this movie brings it. When first viewing the assembled cast members I was kind of hesitant to come watch this movie, but after seeing it I'm glad I took the risk. It was weird for the studio to bring such a diverse cast together and make a comedy with these sort of people. We have seen some of the cast in various comedy films such as Jamie Foxx, Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis, but not the other cast members. The main three characters were funny to watch and mixed pretty well together on screen. They were a funny trio that were joined with a few more actors that I have not seen do comedy like this movie offers. That's how the studio took a major gamble and it was a well calculated one. The main three actors were hialious as alway, but what made this film work were the addition of comedy new comers Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell. Jennifer Aniston was not only funny in this film, but she made a pretty sexy boss. She is a great tease with the other characters which in the way she portrays her sexiness is funny to watch. She really plays well with her sexual side and brings it full force into this movie. She has been on a roll lately staring to two of her best acting roles( Horrible Bosses and Just Go With It). She was nice to watch on film and brings the estrogen to the set were there is a lot of male superiors around. Kevin Spacey was great as always, but his comedy was something that I didn't aspect him to be good at. I know he is great with his one liners, but he brought a whole bag of them and threw them out at the audience during the course of the film. He was one of the funniest people to watch and played his role the best anyone could picture him doing. I have seen Aniston and Spacey do a couple of funny roles, but nothing like this. They brought their comedy to a whole other level. Colin Farrell is not as funny as the other two or has enough screen time, but in my opinion reminds the viewer of Lance Grossman played by Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder because you never really notice who he is the first couple of times you see him, but after awhile it dawns on you who he is. That shows how good Colin does with this role. He was funny on screen when you did see him and added something extra to the movie.The movies set-up is flawless as the characters are nicely introduced as we get to see why each of them hate their super jerk bosses.What makes this a good film and a lot better than the rest out there is that it's a solid comedy, and it stays consistently funny throughout its running time. You will find yourself continuing to laugh at certain scenes even when the movie over. It does not rely on retard humor to make us laugh, the cast were just naturally funny and appealing. This movie will not win awards or anything, but will win a lot of laughs and I have to say this is one of the best comedies out in theaters this year.",Null,0,0,11 July 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," Doesn't have as much punch as the first, but still good
","This movie seems to fall short of the previous film like most DreamWorks sequels do. The studio seems to make entertaining original flicks, but they try to cash in on the fame of the first movies and overstuff the audience with weak follow ups. When it was announced that they were making a sequel to the first Kung Fu Panda it caught a lot of people of guard because the first movie ended well enough that it shouldn't have been a follow up. This movie tumbles short of creativity and freshness that the first movie had, but improves the action and exploring the world of Kung Fu Panda. The action in this film is top notch and very dazzling at times. It has more fight sequences that I would not expect in an animation film, but works quite well. It brings the movie full speed when flat moments arise. The plot of the movie is not as fresh as the first and seems to drag at times, but that's when the other elements start to come alive. The additional component that works well in this movie is the CGI. Its so well done and life like that you are pull visually to a new level. There are certain scenes that just had me stunned at how breath taking it looks. In addition to that, the 3D works well with the film and I believe DreamWorks studio does a great job of adding that portion into their animation films. Other than those various things, this movie has nothing else to offer. This movie in a way feels lazy at times as if the screen writers just start to throw things in the film to propel dull moments. The past animation characters and new ones they bring to the film do nothing to make their present worthwhile. They are mainly placed in the film to carry the story along for us to learn more about Po back story. The movie also tries to hit on an emotional level just as the previous film did, but seems to try too hard and fails at its task. Adding this extra feature is an attempt to connect with the older audience, but doesn't get plugged in all the way. This movie has enough distractions that keeps the flow of the film moving quite nicely for kids to enjoy, but older spectators will not be easily swayed like the first Panda movie seem to accomplish.",Null,1,2,11 July 2011
Bad Teacher," Not the funniest movie, but funny enough
","Bad teacher gave the audience exactly what encased in the title of the movie, a bad teacher and nothing more. This movie wasn't bad in the means of comedy or acting, but what kills this movies attempt in becoming a great comedy is the terrible screen writers that could have done a better job with the story. For me not being a fan of Cameron Diaz acting I have to say she has done a great job at the role presented towards her and makes this movie worth watching. Her acting has never been something that has been identified as great, but in this film her acting shines brightly and enjoyable to watch. She displayed the worst kind of teacher I have ever viewed on screen and in real life and did it so well and was very convincing that she was that uncontrollable. I was shocked in the first few minutes of the film witnessing her character because having seen many of her movies over the years I have never seen her act this way. It put me in the state of mind of when she played her role in The Sweetest Thing. It was great to watch her curse at kids, stab teachers in the back and becoming real sexual in a way towards the male cast. She nails the character to the T, but not even her great acting in this movie could save it from still being fairly bad. Other then her and some of the cast having funny moments the script and plot turns dry. The movie starts off going one direction, turns towards another route and takes a u turn towards a critic and audience disliking. This movie is not a terrible film to watch, but is one of the worst movies in Diaz film career. This movie lacks in the many categories that it presents through out the running time. The comedy is the only thing that makes this movie bearable to watch. The director did a good job of making the audience sort of believe what was talking place during the film. The actors did the best they could do with the script that they were given and were fun to watch. As I said before Diaz was great at her role and Lucy Punch, Justin Timberlake, and Jason Segel were enjoyable to watch and gave this movie have some depth in viewing teachers in a different light. With all their effort that they put in the movie still doesn't pass the test. This movie shows the audience that a poor story can ruin a film no matter on whats taking place during the movie. Bad Teacher is funny at times, but I give this movie an A for effort and a C- for execution.",Null,3,8,11 July 2011
Bridesmaids," Not as funny as people are making it out to be
","I have seen funny comedy based films centered around women and this is not one of them. I might be the odd ball in the bunch, but this movie is not as funny or entertaining like people have been putting it to be.I can count only one scene that grabbed a few jiggles out of me, but the film as a whole, it does not deliver enough comedy to keep me entertained. There are too many dry un funny moments that made me not want to watch this any more. They created this film to become the female version of the Hangover and it never quite accomplishes its goal. I just not a firm believer that woman are not funny enough to carry a whole film by their self and to appeal to every person out there. Yes a few films will grab the attention of most females and some men, but appealing to the masses, I just don't think women comedy movies can do that. Chesley Handler and Ellen are about the only women I have seen enough of that can trigger laughter out of me and neither one of them were in this movie, so I wasn't laughin much during the film. This movie lost me in the first 30 minutes and I just punished myself to sit through the rest. It took forever for the movie to stir up some drama to actually punchier my brain for some entertainment. There spare ha ha moments, but nothing that causes great laughter. The women in this film try to hard be funny instead of being naturally funny and it shows on camera. They just become annoying instead of funny. This movie plays out like a two hour long SNL skit presented by Kristen Wiig and her bunch of humorousness friends. Kristen Wiig is funny to watch in some films, but never quite holds her own in a film centered around her. The plot of the movie was a good one, but the lack there of comedy and running time are the downfall and really kills the vibe of the movie. I guess I'm not the intended demographic for this movie, but I just felt like there was nothing worthwhile going on. I have seen a female wedding themed movie before , Bride Wars, and enjoyed it a lot more than this film and they sold the concept better than this movie. A lot of the jokes go on tremendously long and get annoyingly awkward. This is one of the only films that has been positively review during this summer and I for one feel the complete opposite of the critics and feel this is a huge let down.",Null,3,4,11 July 2011
Cars 2," Not the strongest Pixar movie
","Cars 2 has the pacing of a long Chevron commercial with nice visuals. Pixar's track record has been close to untouchable when crafting their films. Their movie are geared toward children with the thought process of parents interest in mind. They create intelligent, emotionally driven, beautifully detailed animated films, with plenty of humor and heart to appeal to movie for parents and children both to enjoy. With this in mind the creators of films behind the Pixar brand forgot about these elements when making a sequel to the off center original. The makers of the first Cars shied away from those various things to a certain degree and just intended the film to be loved by kids. Cars one was not a bad film at all just not as good or on the same level as its counterparts.The first Cars turn out nice box office numbers despite the some bad reviews by Pixar fans and what they were looking for, but hit home to the children expectation and imagination. In knowing that, this movie take that leap again that the first movie makes and tries to leap again and falls short of the capable entertainment. Cars 2 does not feel like a Pixar film at all, but resembles something that Dream works ( not hating on those movies) would have put out. It does not connect with me emotionally as a fan of Pixars various other films. Kids will enjoy every minute of this, witnessing all the new automobiles that the movie presents on the course of it's running time, but for older generation this movie may be a hit and miss. I for one did not care for the route that this film took and making a sequel. In viewing the first movie at the end of it I felt that it was a complete movie not needing a forced sequel like it received.The movie sequel feels like a straight to DVD quality film or a cartoon movie that would be screened on Disney channel or children networks. They also didn't explored the characters that were loved in the first movie. Every scene the audience was introduced to a new character which became the down fall of this film. They displayed some nice roles, but overcrowded the story of the two main characters that we wanted to know more about. Besides the action and some nicely displayed cars that made it to the film this movie just loses it's flame that it had in the first. The director placed the whole spy flick theme into the film to serve as a distraction for kids so they can introduce new cars. The plot didn't fit right with the whole world of Cars 1. One thing that Disney has done in this film that made it a passable movie is add this element to introduce the action that the first movie didn't have. They knew that another Cars original story line would not work a second time so they went this route to create another film for kids. The idea that Pixar has done was smart and inventive to capitalize on merchandize, but it was a fail attempt.This movie also lacks in comedy and heart that was also present in the first movie, but improve on the visual which are beautiful. Mator became annoying at times and served no purpose while he was on screen and I just never connected to the film as a older audience member. That is how this movie lacks the Pixar brand name influence because it falls short in those categories. Compared to the numerous dazzling hits that Pixar Studio has released in the past years, this film is a great disappointment to their track record, but can still achieve box office glory with the amount of fans of the first that this franchise has. With the growing number of animation films that have been put out in the last 10 years that are not under the umbrella of Pixar Studio's, this film still couldn't make the list of the top animation movies to date.",Null,0,0,11 July 2011
The Hangover Part II," I have seen funny and this is not it
","Phil: 'Everybody order a round of drinks it's on me, oh wait I forgot WE ARE IN A Freakin IHOP.' This has to be the only memorable line of the movie. Besides this line the film is a waste of 1 hour and 45 minutes. This movie is a disappointment to fans of the first movie and fails to give the audience more laughs along the way. This movie reminds me of Paranormal Activity 2 because both movies had successful originals and choose to change nothing about for the sequels, but to add more money to the production. Hangover part 2 does not improve on the stand out comedy that the first one had, but it takes away the feeling of what fans were looking for. After seeing previews of this film I knew it would not be as good as number 1, but not this poorly done. 20 minutes into the movie and you start to notice that this is Hangover 1, but in a new setting with less laughs. This movie is a carbon copy of the original and the director throws some distracting elements into the film to help make its running time. Pointless characters pop ups along the way that bring nothing fresh to the story and a plot that seem to drag along during the beginning, middle and end bring this movie down. This movie seem like it was trying too hard to try to improve on the original and fails badly at it. Todd Phillips should have just left people with the first film instead of destroying the series by making this waste of a movie. The comedy is dry, the story is not fresh, and the acting of the additional cast sours this film. There are a few spare moment laughs that get to you now and then, but nothing memorable. It's sad to say Bridesmaids delivered more comedy than this and that should tell the director a lot. If they really believe that these movies should be made into a trilogy than they must not know that making three movies with the same plot is not a trilogy. It's called wasting money on pointless sequels when the first is just fine. So far the summer has only had two great hits out the may slot and this is not one of them.",Null,0,0,11 July 2011
Super 8," Super 8 is a breath of fresh air in this crowded summer line up
","Films like this constantly remind me why I continue to support film making and choose to believe there is something better to life than the numerous bland sequels destroying the public's taste for great cinema. In a summer full of pirates, Kung Fu fighting animals, and drunken band of friends, this movie sticks its head out of the ashes of poisoned American films and shows itself to be something to be notice and taken seriously. Abrams show the audience that there are some directors out there that take the movie making process serious and do not create films just for a quick buck. Super 8 is a part of a rare breed of movies that are being made not only to entertain the audience and gives us something captivating to watch, but also giving the audience a sense of connection to films. Its gives us a great story to connect with our minds, likable characters to connect to with our hearts, and great visuals to connect with what we see to give the viewer a well rounded movie. Not destroying our intelligence with just visuals and a 8 year old written story line. This movie has a cast of very strong children that act way beyond their age. They seem to work well with each other and the audience can tell when watching the film. Super 8 also feels to be something that would have been released in the 80's, but works quite well in 2011.The director did a great job on keeping a level of secretes to conceal the viewers knowledge of mysterious monster to increase viewing pleasure. Beside a lot of positives this movie has it does lack in the horror aspect that it was going for, but makes up in the mystery department and it keeps the pacing of the movie flowing and never loses a beat while the film is playing. There is also a action scene that shows a train crash and it was beautifully done and revs up the movies. The ending kind of lacked what I believed or was lead to believe on what was going to happen, but the movie as a whole was wonderful to watch.This movie has no re watch value in my opinion because it offers the viewer nothing new that we have not seen before, but creates a great mixture of past films dating from ET to the Close Encounters of the third Kind to Clover field. Abrams takes various elements from those films That we enjoyed and makes something that is full of entertainment and fun to watch in the summer full of lackluster films.",Null,0,0,11 July 2011
Thor," One of the best marvel properties yet
","Thor is easily one of marvels hardest properties to bring to the big screen and could have turned out for the worst with being received as corny, cheesy, or just too hard to understand, but leave it to the folks at marvel to get it right. After seeing this movie having to know nothing about Thor, I have to say this is the best marvel film yet and was told in the best way possible that a story like this could be told. The people behind the making of this film do a great job of taking the source material of the comic and reshaping it enough that it stays true to the comic, but also making it have a sense of realism to it so that the audience can relate to it. They make the actors feel like GODS when they need to, but sprinkle a bit of emotion that makes them feel human in a way. The director does a great job with what is given to him and does a good job of making the audience believe what is going on during the movie (jumping from different universes and such). The pacing of the movie adds a little extra to the story line because it gives away small doses of who these characters are and the world they are from so the viewer won't be blown away with all the things being portrayed. The production team really ups the bar with the amount of sci fiction this film has over the ground things we are accustom to seeing. They did this so well that it has the feel of a star wars movie with the whole travel the universe in a way with a dash of lord of rings attributes because of the present mid age vibe and the two element blend very well to creature the genre of film. I also have to say the acting from the characters in this movie were a lot better than performances people put on it passed marvel film or many other film in general. Every person does an amazing great at the role given to them; whether they had little screen time or a major role to play. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston do an amazing job portraying these two iconic characters and bring them to life. With both actors never really having a big role in a movie before they command their screen time very well and give a break out performances. Also Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman do a great job as always making it easy I'm sure for the first time actors. The director captures the audience also with some of the best visual CGI that I have seen in many movies that it is front lining the visual displayed in Avatar. This film has a lot of funny lines drop throughout it that makes it feel very relaxed at times where it could of felt kind of forced and misplaced. On top of that it has fresh story that was well written and not polluted with dull moments that could draw away from what's going on in the film. This is a great film that could branch out and headlight future cosmic non earth bound movies for the future of films.",Null,1,3,11 July 2011
X-Men: First Class," X-Men is heading in the right direction
","After viewing this movie in theaters I have to say this may be the greatest, underrated film of the summer. This movie goes way beyond the title of a comic book movie to something of The Dark Knight's caliber. This movie hits on every level of realism you can grasp from it being incased in a fiction genre .First Class gave the audience an better outlook on the characters that call themselves X-men and the movie made back in 2000 should have taken this route instead of the road it traveled on. It didn't just throw the viewer into a movie hoping we already knew everything about these characters like X-men 1 did. It gave us a background look and understanding of these people and how they became who they were meant to be. I give this film a very high four stars and it deserves every star it receives. 1 star goes to the screen writers and the people behind crafting the script for the actors. The screen writers created a perfect blend of humor and tone setting that has not been present in the first three X-men movies. The humor is placed in right time to propel a dry moment that could have occurred or to foreshadow character relation development. The screen writers also do a great job of setting a tone that flows smoothly throughout the film. It creates a mixture of action and character building that never goes flat. This films tone is darker than its predecessors, but works quite well with the task at hand in making us understand the characters in the movie. 2 stars for the director attacking this film in the correct way and bringing this franchise up to spend with other strong comic book movies. The series before this film had a lack of understanding in my opinion. It focused too much one character (wolverine) than the team in a whole and who they really were as people. You never felt the realism or group connection between the cast. They seem to just read their lines with no emotion, but Matthew Vaughn corrected that mistake and gave birth to this masterpiece. He does a great job of bring the best out the cast and bring the most practicality out of something that is so science fiction. His future in the film industry has been set by making such a superb movie. 3 stars for the cast doing the best job I have seen in movie created in such a short time span. They bring so much emotion out of the character that they are portraying, that the audience can feel gravity of lines they are reading. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy had such a strong connection in this film that in had seem like they have known each other for years. They out shined the other cast with their powerful connection. There was such passion when they spoke their lines that it just grabbed the audience into the movie. It was such seriousness to every word mutter out their mouth. It was so commanding and gave me as a viewer a better understanding of these two human beings and why they believed what they believe. Kevin Bacon also played a great villain that was on par with more well-known comic book villains throughout the years. He has such a sway with the way he acts on camera that it's hard not to notice his strong performance. This may be one of his greatest performances I have seen in his film career. This is a great blended cast. 4 stars on the action that never seems to slow down from the opening scene of the film to when the end of the movie. For a movie that didn't have long to shoot, they pushed out the most action I have seen in a movie since Spiderman 2. This broke open the box on what a film can accomplish in such short time. Some of the action scene seemed to drive PG-13 to its limit and felt more rated R at times.Also some credit to it have the feeling of a 60's film which is exactly what the film makers were going for. They did the best job I have seen of creating the tone of a certain period in time, making the audience believe we were thrown in the 60's with they whole make up of the film. If Matthew Vaughn can create this movie in a short amount of time and a small budget, it makes someone think what he could do with more money and more time. This movie has taken X-men franchise in the right direction and is under great leadership.",Null,0,1,11 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Send the series off in style
","When something great comes to a end you can't help, but feel a certain level of sadness. The new millennium has given birth to two of the greatest franchise ( Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) that cinema has seen since the original Star Wars.Its very rare to witness not only one film masterpiece, but two is just extraordinary. The Harry Potter films contain the best story telling, action, human connection to the audience and bring out the most emotion of the characters I have ever seen in a franchise. Its amazing to see the transition that the Harry Potter films have taken from innocence kid friendly movies, to when our generation matured, so did the films. They became more dark and more developed with intensity of story and character building. This film is fulfilling, sad and satisfying. The factor that has kept these movies looking amazing is the cinematography and effect that have stayed constant through the film through the years. The film has those two elements and more working for it which makes it the best film in the Potter franchise. This franchise has kept it's flame burning strong for 10 years and director David Yates sends this Wizard series away in the best fashion it could achieve. This movie has to be the best out of the 8 films and combined everything that someone would be looking for in a Harry Potter film and also displays everything that fans of the series have been looking for and that the amount of action.I thought that Transformers Dark of the Moon delivered the most action of the summer and I was wrong. Harry Potter gives the audience the most action that a film can contain combined with the highest level of emotion I have ever seen.Deathly Hollows Part 2 contains the most heart, pure emotion and extreme action I have ever seen in cinema since the original Star Wars. The pacing of this film does not let the audience catch their breath when witnessing this masterpiece. Their is so much to see and so much to take in that if you blink you will miss out something great. This movie delivers everything that someone from critics and fans would be looking for in a close out film. All credit in my opinion goes to the director, David Yates, for bringing this kid friendly movie up to speed with the maturity level that the books brought over the course of their time. Yates and all director of the franchise did the best job transforming the JK Rowling book series into box office hits that has been accepted warmly by fans and critic. But by far David Yates has done the best job of pulling emotions out of his cast, making them relateable to the audience and creating a certain tone for the viewer to witness and grasps the gravity that is going on in the closing journey of Harry Potter. He has done the best job of well rounding his movies that they are not only entertaining, but also makes the audience yearn for more Harry Potter films. I also give a lot of credit to the main cast members from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Ralph Fiennes. They all have done a great job of shaping the memories of the famous novel character into visual ones that have made an imprint into the viewers mind and they have done the best jobs that young to old actors can do with this sort of property. They are all equally nice to watch and bring so much passion to the film that the audience cant help, but notice dedication to the movies.It's not only the main characters that show the greatest acting and hear, but also the secondary actors bring a lot to the film and all pleasant to watching. This movie franchise is made it's mark in the world of cinema as one of the greatest series that have ever been viewed and this film wraps the franchise up in the best way possible. This is possibly the best film of the year and of the past 10 years. All good things do come to a end sooner or later and it has been a heck of a journey, and I?M)m glad I was able to experience it.",Null,26,52,11 July 2011
Fast Five," Fast five is one heck of a ride
","You would think by the fifth movie in this franchise comes out that the wheels on this car ride would start to fall flat, but I have to say this is the best movie of the series. This car driven film series has been given a new tune up of story, reshaping of the body style of the outlook of adventure, and a high octane upgrade of action that makes the ride a bit smoother. It felt refreshing to see the director bring most of the cast from the other Fast and Furious movies together without polluting the story with too many people. There are so many changes to what we were given in the first Fast and Furious franchise that it does fill like the original film any more, but something better that is more enjoyable. It drops the drag racing and replaces it with the heist feel of the Ocean 11 films, mixed with the action of a Bad Boys movie, and car driving and plot of the Italian job. The only flaw of this movie is the acting is not as good as you think it would be after all these years, but the director does a great job of noticing this flaw and replacing it with comedy that hasn't been present in most of the movies. Also Dwayne Johnson is a great addition to the already famous cast and he fits in perfect and ups the action of the movie even more with his presence. This is what a summer movie feels like and gives",Null,1,2,11 July 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Good but not great
","The first Transformers was a great set up for the series openers and transformed the Saturday morning cartoon into a box office hit. The second movie was a disappointment to what the first movie accomplished and left a bad taste in the mouths of fans and critics alike. Now we are introduced to the third and final film that tries to reset the bar set by the original and send Transformers off in an applause. From the middle to end this movie reaches the sheer adrenaline that was presented to the audience in the series opener. Delivering more action and story then the both films, but the major issues associated this with film is the running time is stretched a little and a lot of dry, unfunny humor. Those few hiccups may be a problem, but the last hour of amazing robot vs. robot action will distract from those flaws a bit. Plus the added 3D is a nice touch to the film and is one of the best incorporated 3D I have seen in a movie. Transformers 3 was not a great film by any means, but best one of the series and a great summer flick where you can sit back and enjoy all the action this movie has to offer. Michael Bay is not the greatest director, but is the best in crafting some of the best action sequences ever displayed on a movie screen and does his best work in this movie. He has to be given a lot of credit at what he does best and never fails to raise the level of action in each one of the Robot movies, despite the lack there of story and acting. He knows his weakness as a director and knows how to outshine it with his craft, making his movies enjoyable to watchable. In saying all those things, the story that follows Shia Labeouf character use to symbolize an anchor in the sense that it ways down the film, never letting it reach its potential. It was redundant at times to watch him and his gang of pointless cast members running across the screen, screaming, making bad jokes and doing nothing but serve as a human connection for the audience to relate to. Rosie Whiteley, who is a far better actor than Megan Fox and more charming, was a great plus to the Transformers story. Also new comers John Malkovich and Ken Jong are meaningless, replaceable actors that are placed in the film to be a comic relief that never gets there. The human cast that succeeds in making their presence be felt are Patrick Dempsey and Frances McDormand who were incredible to watch in this film and display the best acting out of the cast. They fit in perfect and brings a certain edge and seriousness to the film. I'm going out on a limb here and say that the thing that makes this a good film are the robots. Their acting has never been showcased in the movies and never given enough screen time to understand them better, but Bay must have realize that and given them more depth. They display better performances than their human counterparts and give the audience what we have been yearning for since the begin and that's more connection to them. I mean beside them having more depth, they have a lot of nice eye dazzling scenes and just grabs the enter child in you. This apocalyptic movie tone is way darker than its predecessors and pushes the boundary of a PG- 13 movie. The Transformers trilogy as a whole if not one of the greatest cinema has seen, but on the perspective of action films, it has set the bar high for action films in the future. Transformer 3, while a flawed movie at times sends the Robot series out in style and is one best sequel by far in the summer non worthy sequels.",Null,1,4,11 July 2011
