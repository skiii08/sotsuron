The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk is Incredible
","This was a real good movie people! Marvel is doing a nice job with their superhero movies, and I think we'll have a lot more of these to come. While not quite as good as IRONMAN, it is in the same ballpark.The plot is pretty predictable, but you're sure to enjoy the ride. Great performances from Edward Norton, Tim Roth and William Hurt. Liv Tyler was alright, but then she didn't have a lot to do.The special effects are incredible. 'nough said.Lou Feriggno has a cameo, and he provides the voice for The Hulk as well, which is pretty cool. Stan Lee has his usual cameo also. And speaking of cameos, look for Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is a cool cameo to tie the Marvel Universe together.It gets a 7.5/10 from me, and now that they have the groundwork down, I'm sure the next installment of The Incredible Hulk will be even better.",8,2,6,13 June 2008
