Marie Antoinette," kind of movie you want to review again and again
","I like everything about this movie - actors, plot, decorations, costumes, music etc. It is not overloaded with many dialogues which makes the movie more intriguing and fascinating. The way the story is presented motivated me to read more about European kings and queens of those times, to dive deeply into this amazing epoch.Definitely recommend!",10,2,4,10 August 2017
