Hereditary," i wasn't expecting it to be good...
","So, for starters, i never write reviews. this movie genuinely surprised me. should it have the title 'scariest movie of the year'? no. the cinematography and use of surround sound was phenomenal.Toni Collette did an AMAZING job. i highly recommend this movie in a movie theater setting.",8,5,11,11 June 2018
Captain Marvel," See it before you rate it!
","I am not one to usually write reviews, but I feel it is necessary with all the hate surrounding Captain Marvel.
It has been a while since I genuinely enjoyed a Marvel movie. The last one was Logan, which I think we can all agree that was one of the best things produced by Marvel thus far.
I honestly did not think Wonder Woman was amazing (maybe a 7?). However, I am all for female empowerment. Captain Marvel was exactly that: female empowerment, but in the best way possible. It didn't have a political agenda at all. It did not promote a feminist view. I was worried Larson's acting would have been lacklustre due to the previews, and some of the lines in the movie were pretty iffy. I was also worried that she would be a total Mary-Sue, but I was completely wrong. There was no lame romance (even though I am hoping that Carol will end up sapphic. She has to follow in Ms. Blanchett's footsteps, right?) to take away from the action: aka Hulk and Widow.
Unlike Infinity War, this movie did not try to pack too many things in at once. I thought it told a complete story, which is what I look for in movies. I don't like the set up for a sequel, even though Marvel clearly intends to add on to her character. Don't knock it until you watch it!",9,1,3,9 March 2019
