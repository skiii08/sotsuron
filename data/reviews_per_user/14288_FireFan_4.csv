Who Framed Roger Rabbit," funny entertainment presented seriously.
","I enjoyed the way the live actors and cartoons complimented each other in this world. Some known cartoon characters appear here as well as stranger ones. It plays like a real detective mystery. The whole theme is based around fantasy and pretending tough, face-the-facts reality. Even the setting is centered in Toontown. Roger is a very silly animated stunt rabbit, taking a beating from his cartoon counterpart Baby Herman, but his girlfriend Jessica Rabbit impresses us as a truly sexy lover had she only been real. One gets the idea that this movie is trying to reach a much broader audience by combining the two kinds of film and it does a pretty good job. I rate it worthwhile watching for most people, including older children.",10,0,0,22 May 2011
Tangled," Tangled with Rapunzel impressed me like lovable Disney fantasies.
","I am a big fan of Walt Disney animated movies whether they are cartoons or some Pixar animation. My folks have always encouraged all of us in my family to appreciate these movies and so they go a long way back in our lives.I thought that once again, Disney made some great characters to involve in their shows. The movie and the actors were very lovable with an influence of strong-willed adventure and anticipation as shown by Rapunzel in her quest. I was deeply focused into it while being concerned of what would happen to her and her friend next. Tangled contains smoothly-delivered animation and a fine story. It's nice to find out what really may have happened in the old fairy tale. Also, it played more intensely than some of Disney's happier kids' stories but that could make it stay more memorable to the older viewers. I did feel like I was doing myself a favor by going to see it finally before the movie left the cinema and lo and behold, it turned out to be a winner.To sum it all up, I would recommend this movie to Disney fans and lovers of fairy tales alike. Even though it seemed someway like girls' cartoon 'chick flick' story line material with its soap opera-like interaction between the main characters, it really had pleasant feelings to leave to all levels of movie goers.",10,2,5,13 February 2011
Thor," Thor leads a cast in a show of epic proportions!
","The movie Thor presents the superhero on a spectacular scale worthy of the comic book stories and does not disappoint its regular readers or newcomers to this important Marvel comics character. The story and the purpose behind Odin the All Father's decisions and Thor the Thunder God's calamities are pretty well handled and explained. I liked Thor's determined, but just as virtuous, display in Asgard and down on Earth (Midgard) convincingly showing us that Thor is a god of a colorful mythology. The other Asgardian gods and inhabitants are depicted as being pretty impressive also. In this movie, actress Natalie Portman and the Earthlings thrill the audience equally well from the mortal side of life on Earth and give the audience fine acting too. All together it sets the stage for meaningful interaction between the two groups. The movie has plenty of fun special effects also so as to measure up to such a good story line. I enjoyed the depth of characterization given Loki and some of the rest of the cast. The movie has a very upbeat ending and leaves the audience in a good mood when Thor triumphs in his battles despite the many changes that happen during his visit to Earth (Midgard). Other character tie-ins (the Avengers) are appropriately mentioned here and there which gives the character Thor some great potential to be connected to other superhero movies as well. All this makes for a very exciting Marvel super drama to entertain many different ages of movie goers.",8,0,2,20 May 2011
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Snow White is a visual and audio wonder, even over time.
","This cartoon took much painstaking effort and planning to create. It is a delicately and carefully made masterpiece of animation. The film used an old-fashioned way of drawing each little movement of the cartoons many different separate times and then it was all blended together as one whole. The characters win you over and the story is heartwarming. This full-length movie was a plan of Walt Disney's to make after he and the studio earned enough revenue to pay for its production by many cartoon shorts with some including Mickey Mouse, known as the 'silly symphonies.' The movie/cartoon Snow White is a very special family film intended for children of all ages. I would count it as a great classic.",10,1,1,31 December 2014
