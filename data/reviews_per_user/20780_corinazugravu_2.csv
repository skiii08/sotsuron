Minority Report," not so good as i expected
","It is an interesting movie.Cruise and the actress who plays the pre-cog girl are wonderful. But I don`t really know why, there is a little thing (or maybe, something greater) really not perfect here. Maybe the end?!Or the idea?!Or a lot of small thing used in the movie,that I have already seen or red about in other SF movies or books?!As a whole, the Minority report is not a revelation.It gives you not a big deal to think after.. Quite touchy, but....not the movie that I expected.Rather commercial.",Null,0,0,1 January 2003
Spirited Away," magic cartoons
","Movies like Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke made me love again cartoons. I always thought that cartoons are mainly for children, but these showed me that it is not true.Maybe because everyone of us has a child hidden deep inside...i don`t really know.In a few words, i think they are wonderful and i advise them to everyone thinks reality has kept , however,a magic in it.",Null,0,1,26 December 2002
