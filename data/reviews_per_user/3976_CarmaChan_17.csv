Blade Runner 2049," The most intriguing threesome in cinematic history
","It's Saturday morning. Blade Runner 2049 officially released last night, the reviews are in, my husband tells me a headline written by someone who is clearly disappointed--in the money that came in? I can't imagine being disappointed in the movie!I can imagine a slow build at the box office for this epic scifi sequel, because young people with whom I've spoken were utterly unfamiliar with the fact that Blade Runner is one of the top 3 scifi films of all time. Scifi doesn't get better than Blade Runner and 2049. I told two colleagues yesterday that I'd seen the movie on Thursday night and restrained myself from hyping it too much...I hate to hype it up and ruin it for others. I hate spoilers. I hate reading reviews before I see a movie, and more often than not I hate reading reviews after I've seen a movie because it taints my experience. I write reviews when I feel strongly about applauding the work of a great crew and cast, or explaining where it lost me for the artisans of future movies and series.Let me just say that not only does BR2049 feature the most intriguing threesome ever filmed--which is saying something--it also moves and twists in mysterious ways, in plausible ways, in deliciously gritty and dirty and sensual ways. This is film noir at is utmost best.I love that it starts out with minimalism and slowly builds with perfect foreplay and a climactic ending that I will not forget. I love that Ryan Gosling is the star, the protagonist, the leading man, the blade runner of 2049, and I love that I had to wait to see our beloved Mr. Ford until exactly the right moment in the telling of a complex, rich & believable plot.I love/hate this world. I adore the cinematography, the characters, the way they're portrayed. I rated this movie 10 stars because I find no fault with it. It is a magnificent work of art, it is a great movie, it is everything we want a movie to be. And it is rare that an almost 3-hour movie doesn't feel like one. At no point while watching did I feel restless, bored, irritated, impatience, or 'that's ridiculous'. Solid plot. Outstanding performances. Excellent dialogue. Perfect audio, visual, special fx, makeup, wardrobe, music... it's all so smoothly blended, one doesn't notice it while watching, one is simply, blissfully engaged.",10,1,7,7 October 2017
3:10 to Yuma," This remake is a huge improvement on the original.
","I saw this version for the first time last night on cable TV and was totally engaged and very impressed. Today I watched the original with Glenn Ford, who did a great job as Ben Wade, but I have to say that this remake is a huge improvement on the original. There are many changes in the story and I applaud every choice. The casting is excellent - Logan Lerman, the actor who plays the 14-year-old son in this version - did an outstanding job and stole the show, in my opinion. My favorite part is where he believes there is an ounce of decency in this murderer, and Wade tells him he has to be rotten to the core to lead this bunch of animals.The directing is also a big improvement... the closeup on the Gatling gun and the rolling of a cigarette in the opening robbery scene are subtle tell-tale signs that they are expecting big trouble.Ben Wade is so much more heinous in this version and it's important that he should be - it gives more credibility to Dan Evans' reasons for risking his life.The dialogue is purely outstanding - 'I'm not stubborn.' What a perfectly timed conversation! Great casting, performances, editing, everything - APPLAUSE!!!",10,2,4,19 July 2010
It," Laughed Out Loud
","I'll admit I am the worst kind of friend you want to watch a horror movie with because they don't scare me at all, they are all so ridiculous! Going to see 'IT' was not my idea, I tagged along with a group that wanted to see it. I really tried to suppress my giggles, but I just couldn't help it. First of all, let me tell you the only horror movie that scared me as an adult was THE SHINING. Not because of any of the ooky-booky stuff like redrum or blood floods, but because crazy drunk people are scary! Crazy drunks are real monsters and you never know when they're going to get too drunk and too crazy--it happens suddenly, and what are you going to do--leave your sleeping child with them? Run out into the freezing night half naked?Clowns are a joke. I can understand why a little kid might be afraid of some clowns, but come on--teenagers--are you seriously afraid of clowns? This particular plot is so full of holes it was too funny. First it's a ship going down a sewer drain. Then there's red balloons. And we all float down here. And then the spooky house. Blood coming out of a sink. None of it tied together. It's a hodgepodge of imagery and nonsense. It's like seeing a little kid's imagination for over two hours. I just had to laugh.Cinematically it was well done. The actors were all good. As usual with a teen story, they had to exploit the little girl. They had to oggle her training bra. Of course all the pervs needed to see that scene for just a few more seconds. The clown himself--Pennywise the Dancing Clown that never danced--was iconic and the makeup was a great choice. The movie was well done, and I don't blame the genre, so I give it 7 stars because it's pretty good, but come on...this is NOT a 'Great' movie!",7,1,4,24 September 2017
A Star Is Born," Flawless and Extraordinary
","There are few films that have caused my anticipation level to reach the point of buying advance tickets and counting down the days to the premier. As soon as I saw the first trailer for this fourth, flawless and extraordinary version of a story that never gets old, I began watching everything I could... interviews, red carpet appearances, Lady Gaga music videos, and of course, I had to watch the Barbra Streisand movie again! We saw this film last night, on it's opening night in California, and it did not disappoint one bit! I do believe Lady Gaga will earn an Oscar for her performance--she deserves it! And Bradley Cooper deserves an Oscar for directing and acting as well. I absolutely love everything about the artistic choices in this movie! From the moment Ally first went on stage with Jack, I decided I had to see this movie again on the big screen. I also pre-ordered the soundtrack and was happy to have it available to play this morning. All day I have been thinking about this movie. I am so glad it was made, glad Lady Gaga was chosen, and utterly impressed with the entire cast, writing, production, and above all, the music!",10,15,34,5 October 2018
Citizen Kane," an over-rated movie
","For the life of me, I have tried hard to understand how and why this movie could possibly be considered the #1 film in the first 100 years of American film-making. The first time I tried to watch it, I got a few minutes and hated it; I couldn't make myself care. I tried again, because it's a 'classic' made by a 'genius', and I sincerely wanted to understand how it could possibly be voted higher than Casablanca.It is boring and noisy and the makeup is horrible. I will never understand why this movie was voted #1. I wouldn't even put it in the top 100.It has failed in every way a film can fail. I don't care about the protagonist. I find it clichÃ©, obnoxious and dull. Perhaps in its day it was fresh, but it doesn't stand the test of time the way Casablanca does.I don't care what anyone else says about this movie; in my opinion, it is the worst thing a movie can be: boring. I will never force myself to watch it again.",3,49,89,31 January 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," I've waited for this my whole life!
","To the Army of Artists required to create this masterpiece: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I read the books as a child. I read them again and again in my growing up years, my adult life. I gave them as gifts to children.I saw the earlier attempts to bring this story to film, and it was just sad - Aslan as a puppet? Aslan as a cartoon? No. It never worked for me.You've done it to perfection! I adore the choice of actors and actresses for the four children - especially Lucy! You got all four of them right, and especially Lucy! I've seen the trailer for Prince Caspian, for this summer, and my son and I are so excited to see it! Looking forward to ALL SEVEN of the movies. YEAH!!!!",10,1,2,23 December 2007
Dead Poets Society," Thank goodness for these kinds of men!!!!! (Men, Men, Yummy Men)
","From script to casting to directing, editing, sound, setting, cinematography, performances -- this film is flawless. It's a movie I can watch again and again, already have and will watch it again with any new friend who wants to see it. It's a movie I will pay to see again. I would NEVER pirate this film -- that's despicable -- these artists deserve residual income! This story is fresh food to souls, hearts and minds dwindling in a world of zombies, vampires, bloodlust, phony masculinity, phony femininity, numbing avarice and over-the-top fashionistas.Thank goodness for Walt Whitman and men who can appreciate him. Thank goodness for E. E. Cummings and men who can appreciate him. Thank goodness for Dr. Seuss and men who can be grateful for the sacred moments of reading his books to children.Thank goodness for men who get that boys can become great men, regardless of how much muscle fiber is on their bones, or how little interest they have in sports. That words have power. Artistry is potent. Romance is courage.",10,2,2,21 February 2011
Once," A Rare Gem!
","It is rare to find a film that is sweetly romantic and has not so much as a kiss on screen. I kept expecting the boy to get the girl in the usual way - but this couple never had sex! I love how the story unfolded. I love the creative relationship that blossomed between these two. I loved the way the sound engineer went from thinking they were a waste of time, a bunch of oddballs, to recognizing that there was something special happening here.It has been days since I saw it and I'm still thinking about it, I want to hear the songs again and add them to my music library. Thank you for this wonderful story and perfectly done movie!!",9,2,4,19 July 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," A thorough pleasure to watch!
","This wasn't a film I was anticipating, however, when you are in love with a comic book collector, you can't help but fall in love with these old stories coming to life! So I bumped this title up to the top of my Blockbuster queue (thanks very much to DishTV for the excellent new member freebies!) - it arrived in the mailbox yesterday and we watched it last night. It was a thorough pleasure! It was obvious that when Spielberg sets out to do a thing, he does it with a big heart. The animation is gorgeous! The story they have adapted from the original comics is perfectly timed! Thank you for not making it too long!! And thank you for ending it the way you did. Applause! Can't wait to see another adventure of Tintin!There are several truly special moments in this film and I won't spoil it for others - trust me, if you are like me and not a fan of this genre, you will still be glad you put this one on your watch list!",10,3,4,21 July 2012
Being John Malkovich," Unforgettable and it set the bar high for dark comedy
","I have seen this movie multiple times. I thought I had already reviewed it, but as I looked back over my reviews on IMDb, realized, I had been silent on my favorite dark comedy. A failure I must amend immediately.What made me think of this movie today is Catherine Keener in Get Out, the 2017 gem created by Jordan Peele, which I had to praise after watching it last night on HBO. I think it was a really smart choice for Peele to cast her. I will never forget her, since seeing her in Being John Malkovich. What I love about this movie is, well, everything--no, let me take away 1 star and give it 9, because as I recall, the ending did get a little too drawn out and overstayed its welcome. The ending did remind me of a lesson learned at UCLA Screenwriting taught by Professor Richard Walter, about beginnings and endings and when to exit the scene, and examples of sometimes when directors can't get off the stage. But it wasn't too bad, the ending, it didn't spoil the whole movie, it just went on beyond what felt like a good ending.As for the 9 stars I give it--everything, from the moment the story begins, drew me into this deliciously weird world, and it was as funny as it was mesmerizing! Every time I mention this movie to someone, I feel the urge to watch it again. And every time I have watched it again, I fall in love with its weirdness and humor all over again. So it should definitely be on the watch list of anyone who has not seen it, who likes dark comedy. I can't think of a better dark comedy than Being John Malkovich!",9,1,1,7 March 2018
The Princess Bride," Delightful, Charming, Hilarious, Unforgettable - A Great Movie!
",This movie is a MUST-SEE for anyone. I've watched it many times and it is absolutely wonderful.This is a movie you can watch with children as young 4 years old. I can't think of anything in this movie that a 4-year-old couldn't handle.It would make a wonderful gift DVD for any child. The theme is timeless and it is just funny and sweet and entertaining all though! Boys will love it. It has a giant and sword-fighting and pirates and big rats.Girls will love it. It has a beautiful princess who finds true love and is kidnapped and rescued.This is in my Top 10 movies of all time.,10,0,1,20 December 2007
Get Out," The Right Amount of Bizarre
","I am not going to spoil the fun for anyone who has yet to engage in this cinematic treat! The first I heard of it was during the Oscars show on March 4th--Jordan Peele wrote, directed & produced an Oscar-nominated movie? Where have I been, in a cave? Well, sort of, yes...I don't hang out much on social media, and I've been watching commercial-free on-demand shows for quite some time. And since the wildfires destroyed my home in northern California in the wee hours of October 9th, I haven't been in the movie market!I had to see this. And now I have to see it again, even though I watched it last night--it's that fun--it's that strange--it's that good! It's the right amount of bizarre. I mean, seriously--these actors who are playing these characters are so perfect, I really want Jordan Peele to hear this virtual applause!!! The casting is great, and the direction made it perfect. I really had no idea what this plot was about. I had not seen a trailer or anything. All I knew is that Jordan Peele, a favorite comedian since Key & Peele have been busting my gut for years, was nominated for a movie that he wrote, directed, and produced. Must see. And wow, it did not disappoint me at all. The tension built ever so slightly and carefully. The characters showed just the right amount of bizarre--I wasn't sure--is there something wrong with that person? Is there? That was a little odd, okay...that was...I'm not sure. I loved the reference to 'Eyes Wide Shut'--hilarious!I was feeling Twilight Zoned. It was like Stepford Wives meshed with The Help. It's so much FUN!!!I rarely give a movie all 10 stars because most movies do have room for improvement. I gave this movie 9 stars because it is that close to perfection as an artistic expression of oh so much more than its surface--this movie runs very deep in my humble opinion--it made me think very deeply, it is provocative in an enjoyable way, it is metaphorical and philosophical without being preachy or evangelical. Really well done, Mr. Peele! And kudos to the entire cast and crew! Thanks for this gem!",9,19,38,7 March 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Noomi Rapace did it to perfection. (Contains Spoilers)
","I rarely include spoilers in my reviews. The only reason I will in this one is for the benefit of Noomi Rapace and other members of the cast and crew who made this movie perfect. Hollywood does the weirdest things. Rather than give a new writer a chance, they'll remake an absolutely perfect recent film. Bizarre. I truly hope it backfires on them. Seeing the trailers for the remake, I'm baffled. It's flat. There is nothing in their eyes. Noomi Rapace is gripping in this film. She's my hero. This film contains the most brutal rape scene imaginable, and I nearly had to stop watching, but I could not stop watching *her* - there was something about *her* that promised me that this was not gratuitous sadism. I cheered my guts out when she cleverly trapped the human predator and exacted justice. I had not read the book, so I had no idea this was coming. Noomi's performance is beyond 10. I can't think of another actress who has gone this deep in drama, and I want her to know, it was a very satisfying movie to watch - not mere entertainment - it was cathartic. Thank you.",10,13,18,1 December 2011
Midsommar," I feel cheated
","We saw this in theater last night. It is rare for me to give a movie such a low rating, and I'll be clear about why I can't rate this higher than 6 out of 10 stars.Plot. This movie has a gaping hole in the plot about 15 minutes into the story and the writer failed to address it. You can't ask audiences to get over such a chasm of disbelief. My husband is pretty generous as a movie lover and he couldn't get over it. So the rest of the movie you're still asking, 'Why are they still there?' It's implausible.That said, there is a lot going for the movie... strong performances... cinematography... interesting setting... unusual.Unlike 'Get Out' which I had to watch twice more in a week because it was so much fun, I will never watch this movie again. But it is worth seeing once, though some scenes are grotesque and cannot be unseen (I blocked my view, knowing what was coming).It's really messed up. It's weird. And it has the weirdest porn scene I've ever seen, and I've seen some weird stuff - but this exceeds all weirdness. And that was a very funny part, the entire audience in the theater was laughing.The protagonist is a very strong character and carries this film - fantastic job by Florence Pugh!I believe all the writer had to do to close that gaping hole in the plot was to make it more of a trap. Otherwise, we're sitting there stuck on 'Why are they still there?' Made no sense.",6,2,6,24 July 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," Top 5 in the history of films
","This is definitely one of the most important stories ever written, and the 1962 movie was beautifully put together. In my humble opinion as a movie lover, and as someone who saw this movie in my youth, it need never be re-made. It cannot be improved upon, and there are precious few films about which that can be said.I have seen and read many stories about the ugliness and hypocrisy of prejudice. None touches upon the subject more poignantly than this one.The children are prejudiced about a mysterious neighbor, based on fear, not fact.The town is prejudiced about Negroes, based on fear, not fact.I could watch this film every year and never tire of it. This is a movie I will make sure my grandchildren see, and a book I will make sure they read.",10,1,2,20 December 2007
Apollo 13," An excellent movie about an event that gripped the world.
","This movie is outstanding in every way. It does everything right. I have seen it more times than I can count, and I am not tired of seeing it. It always inspires me.The performances in this film are first-rate. I wasn't watching famous actors, I was seeing the real men, real women, real children, fighting to solve problems, relentlessly holding on to loved ones.I get tears just writing about it here, now.'Failure is not an option.' I will never get over that moment, that line, and that fact that it really happened. It all really happened.Wow.",10,1,3,20 December 2007
13 Hours," Benghazi Simplified
","I am giving this movie only 7 out of 10 stars because I think the producers and writers did not go far enough to clarify why more help did not come. It is nice to see the humanity and heroism of some of the people who were there when the ambassador was attacked. It was informative to see how it unfolded according to those who were on the ground, assuming the storytellers were true to their accounts and their accounts were objective. To be objective means you have to recognize that you don't know what you don't know and you might be wrong about what you think you know. So it was an interesting movie to watch, a sad story, a mess, maybe a stupid mess, but every person who was there had a choice whether or not to be there. Personally, I don't understand why any sane person goes to the Middle East. If you choose to put yourself in the middle of that mess, don't expect me to sympathize or cheer when you survive their tribal egomania. The Middle East is a lost cause, that's what this film confirms. It reminds us that outsiders don't belong there. It shows us why it was a mistake to get involved in their tribal conflicts. We have better things to do - there are many places in this world where the majority of the people and the governments want our help and we do not give them our help - that is the question. Why wasn't there better security for this small group of Americans who shouldn't have gone there in the first place? That's someone else's question, not mine. My question is why are we in the Middle East at all? Why aren't we 'helping' Africa and/or South America? Why aren't we helping the governments and people who have real problems and who want our help to become more civilized? Why is that conflict - in that region between those tribes who have hated each other for thousands of years - why is that conflict worthy of the sacrifice of our sons and their children? Yes, the people who were there and were faced with aggression and certain death were remarkable in their struggle to survive. It's a bit like cheering for someone who survives diving into a snake pit. Don't dive into snake pits.",7,0,1,19 April 2017
