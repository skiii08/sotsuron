Sucker Punch," very good film, deserves a much higher rating
","I'm going to keep this brief. This film is packed full of metaphors (the entire fight scenes for example) If you are of the intelligence to understand these metaphors then you will find the film highly enjoyable. However, if you are say the type of person who is easily confused by traffic lights then you will not enjoy this film. The plot of the film makes perfect sense if you can follow it and it saddens me that so many people have slated a good film because they are mentally incapable of doing so. In my opinion this film was far better than 300 but not as good Watchmen which is also worthy of higher acclaim. Well done Zach, keep up the good work!",8,1,2,15 September 2011
