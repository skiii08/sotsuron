Black Swan," 10/10, it wasn't near perfection... it was perfect (P E R F E C T I O N).
","OK i know its awkward when you see a GUY that is a heterosexual that thought black swan was the best movie ever but see thats the problem with society their always stereotyping things same with me i stereotyped black swan before i saw it and by the time the credits flew out i just witnessed pure perfection in the form of beauty and darkness. This movie is just pure perfection it excels on all levels with beautiful cinematography, some of the best performances I've ever seen (such as Winona Ryder, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, and mainly Natalie Portman 10/10 performance best female performance ever she outdid herself here this role was legendary), great writing, great directing, beautiful dark and emotional disturbing scenes. Don't listen to the ignorant and harsh treatment that people give this movie, yes i do know a lot of people wont find this the best movie ever its my opinion don't bash me for it but this movie is the best to me it captures every scene in a Gratatious yet beautiful puzzle like style and it truly is Darren Aronfsky's best. For those that haven't seen it please watch it your missing a macabre of beautiful twisted disturbing yet taut darkness. There are no luminous scenes in this catastrophe its true darkness yet beautiful. This movie is perfection with a capital p and thats saying something.",10,1,4,1 October 2012
The Shining," 'The tide of terror that swept the nation...'
","THE SHINING, a movie that contained the scene that everyone is familiar with;Jack Nicholson chopping down the door as Wendy screams in sheer terror and defiance, he then utters the words 'here's Johnny'. A movie that changed the landscape of horror and fear, something beyond modern day horror, Kubrick knew what he was doing with this masterpiece as it presented horrifying, riveting, and over the top symbolism and diction of moral themes such as racism, ghost, death, psychology, and characters losing whats in a humans pure sense of mind. Wendy and Jack are put through hell in this movie and the acting given by Shelley and jack to display pure madness is done with perfection. The acting is amazing;this movie is extremely psychotic; its horrific and terrifying; this movie had no jump scenes yet it succeeded to present a creep hellish atmosphere. In my opinion this is the best horror movie of all time alongside Halloween (1978) its true state of the art horror at its best. For those youngsters or new generation horror fans take time away from paranormal activity, hatchet, those shitty remakes (not the good remakes) and watch this it could never be remade its horror at its best, its 'the tide of terror that swept the nation'...",9,0,1,29 October 2012
Evil Dead," With every Break, Splatter, Drip, Stab, Slaughter... we applauded. This was one hell of a twisted ride.
","After watching oz the great and powerful i realized it was just a cute kids flick so i needed to please my bloody desires with some out of this world insanity. So we drove down to Austin and entered the paramount theater (not going to get into details since i had never been to Austin before and was going for the evil dead i do live in Texas though, anyways) and as the screams and madness filled the theater i could not believe what i was witnessing it was everything i wanted and more, and thats coming from an old school horror fan i absolutely loved the original but have never seen the 2nd one or army of darkness (i will though) but if you really give this film a chance and forget about the original and accept it for a new take on the story you will love it. Some characters i did find quite annoying like David was kind of Annoying... i did enjoy Jessica Lucas character even though one could argue her death was rather nerve wracking, i did like Mia, probably the best character in the movie and Lou Taylor Pucci was really good in this would like to see more from him he was convincing and thats all that matters. The movie had beautiful cinematography, the acting was superb from most of the cast, story was good but actually could have been better, the twist(s) were unpredictable, directing was mediocre i felt kind of awkward through the 2nd half. The movie shines when it delivers on the gore and outrageous mutilation but i wanted this to be more than a gore fest i wanted at least the next 'A nightmare on elm street' but the movie makes up for its flaws at the end. OVERALL: Don't miss this horror film it may not be our next THE SHINING but it is one hell of a good fun bloody time and even you end up hating the movie you will admire the death scenes and the mayhem in this movie,blood rain, demon lesbian, exorcist like antagonist, extremely bloody and violent death scenes (WARNING! this movie is really sadistic, Alvarez crossed the line, its like watching a sick rapist murder fantasies come to life this is a very dark and just disturbing film and it all looks good), and let me just say i really enjoyed the tree rape scene... this movie is horror fanatic paradise, and last but not least this is not a remake its a new vision of EVIL, on April 5 let it consume you. Its the best movie I've seen so far this year other than side effects, experience it. (if only it was in IMAX) This movie kicked Ass!",8,92,270,12 March 2013
Prometheus," Ridley Scott's visual/sci-fi/horror masterpiece
","First let me start off by saying i don't understand the anonymous hate given to this movie it was truly epic on every single aspect. From the opening scene to the scene where the space jockey flipped out this groundbreaking sci-fi epic distributed state of the art visual effects, Oscar worthy performances, grisly images, truly mesmerizing IMAX 3D that left me breathless. To me this movie succeeded on every level and could have even been perfection but it had its flaws (every movie has flaws except for the dark knight, district 9, AVATAR, and black swan). Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, and Noomi Rapace give breathtaking performances. Any fans of a truly amazing movie that requires thinking and mind blowing visuals watch P R O M E T H E U S. Its a must see i will be getting on Blu ray and thats my short review (saw it on opening day in IMAX 3D twice).",8,3,10,24 September 2012
