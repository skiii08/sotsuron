Changeling," A beautifully created masterpiece!
","Well Clint Eastwood has certainly created a masterpiece this time.I'll mention straightaway that it's not particularly my genre, being more of a Drama movie, so I'll be reviewing more indifferently here. Nevertheless, this movie turns out as a pure classic, to be remembered for years to come! **Synopsis** Inspired by actual events that occurred in 1920s-era Los Angeles, Clint Eastwood's 'Changeling' tells the story of a woman driven to confront a corrupted LAPD after her abducted son is retrieved and she begins to suspect that the boy returned to her is not the same boy she gave birth to. The year was 1928, and the setting a working-class suburb of Los Angeles. As Christine (Angelina Jolie) said goodbye to her son, Walter, and departed for work, she never anticipated that this was the day her life would be forever changed.Upon returning home, Christine was distressed to discover that Walter was nowhere to be found. Over the course of the following months, the desperate mother would launch a search that would ultimately prove fruitless. Yet just when it seemed that all hope was lost, a nine-year-old boy claiming to be Christine's son seemed to appear out of thin air. Overcome with emotions and uncertain how to face the authorities or the press, Christine invites the child to stay in her home despite knowing without a doubt that he is not her son. As much as Christine would like to accept the fact that her son has been returned to her, she cannot accept the injustice being pushed upon her and continues to challenge the Prohibition-era Los Angeles police force at every turn. As a result, Christine is slandered by the powers that be, and painted as an unfit mother. In this town, a woman who challenges the system is putting her life on the line, and as the situation grows desperate, the only person willing to aid her in her search is benevolent local activist Reverend Briegleb (John Malkovich).Source: IMDb Starring Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich, and Gattlin Griffith. Directed by Clint Eastwood.**Storyline: 4 Stars** The story of the movie is both intense and gripping... the movie was 2.5 hours long, it never got tedious, in fact I didn't feel like it had taken more than about 2 hours... and, unlike The Dark Knight, this movie felt like it had a nice rounded ending... Quite satisfying through and through! **Music: 5 Stars** In my opinion, this music score is the only worthy contender with Danny Elfman's Hellboy 2 score for the upcoming Oscars. A wonderful score, not overly done, carrying the tone of the movie beautifully! Now that I look at it, I find that on the IMDb page that the music composer is actually Clint Eastwood himself... Never knew a director could make such great music! **Acting: 3 Stars** Angelina Jolie makes a wonderful performance in the leading role in this movie, and really connects with her character! The other members of the cast aren't excellent, but don't let the side down on no account...**Conclusion** I suppose you already know what I'm about to say... It's an excellent movie! Watch it!",9,5,10,16 December 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Del Toro is pure genius!
","I went to see Hellboy 2 last night, I left the cinema feeling as happy as anyone ever could be! I have been waiting all year for this film to come out, and it certainly didn't disappoint me! We start the story with all our favourite characters from the first film... and lot's of great new characters! If you like characters, you won't be disappointed by Hellboy 2.The story takes-off with a beautiful narration by John Hurt which truly sets the tone for the whole film.The films sets out with a great start! wonderful fights and beautiful choreography, which will bring a sense of excitement over you, then there will be a turning point, where Del Toro will play on all your senses at once... then the story really starts! Beautiful paintings of Love, Betrayal, and Hard Choices along with Sacrifice, as only Del Toro Knows how to do.I can hardly do justice in reviewing this film, but I shall endeavour to bring parts out in future reviews.Directed by Guillermo Del Toro. Starring Ron Perlman, John Hurt, Selma Blair, and Jeffrey Tambor.There are some really funny bits, great expletives in Hellboy's own fashion, but yet we come to that great part where one has to make a choice between love or loyalty! Wonderful score by Danny Elfman, some really funny songs too! A worthy sequel to the first Hellboy! For those of you not at all interested in the first film: this one takes on a totally different look on Hellboy and can work as a stand-alone film... that means you don't have to have watched the fist film to love the second! Well that's enough for one review, but look out for more upcoming Hellboy reviews! Movie Rating: 10/10",10,3,4,5 November 2008
Gone Baby Gone," A True Original
","New to DVD! Ben Afleck's directorial debut is like no other film you will find, very original! A little girl is gone missing, our hero must search all of his untoward contacts in order to find her... when he does find the girl it is not in the way that he had expected...This movie is relentless, it is a drama in the legend of 'Good Will Hunting' yet this movie refuse to be a clone and will never resort to being a general 'feel-good' movie! I basically just got this movie because it was exclusive to Blockbuster, and I'm not usually a fan of the Drama genre, as I tend to think of them as an excuse for poor plot line... But this movie is relentless, excellent original storyline! Crime, Guilt, Family, Love, all to be found in this movie, a wonderful mix of emotions! Starring Cassey Afleck, Michelle Monaghan, Meg Ryan, Ed Harris, and Morgan Freeman, A great cast, Ed Harris is particularly good in this movie! Movie Rating 9/10",9,0,0,5 November 2008
The Orphanage," The Greatest Horror of All Time!
","The Orphanage has recently come out on DVD in the UK and is currently available in the USA, so I once again want to draw my readers' attentions to this true masterpiece.Rated by most reviews 5 stars ***** and by the rest 4 stars **** this film is the second Pan's Labyrinth (horror version) and should certainly not be missed! Like Pan's Labyrinth, The Orphanage is very pictorially thought provoking, and has certainly hit the mark again! Produced by Guillermo Del Toro and directed by JA Bayona. Starring Belen Rueda and Geraldine Chaplain.Often rated as one of the most scary films ever, this is a great film for Horror fans, but at the same time it is really thought provoking! Watch it!",10,2,6,5 November 2008
