Who Framed Roger Rabbit," An unforgettable movie
","Since I was a kid, I've ALWAYS loved the movie 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. I must have been at least three or four when I first watched it. Now when you're that young, everything else goes over your head except for some of the main characters like Eddie, Jessica, Baby Herman, Benny the Cab(in general; not really what they say and some of the stuff they do) and esp. Roger Rabbit himself. What more can you get from the movie as a four year old other than the crazy, funny cartoon characters? Now since I'm older, I've seen the movie many times and I realized why my parents ditched the movie the first time we saw it; there was a lot of language and violence in it and had some suggestive things in it. I found many of those parts pretty funny (like Baby Herman for instance. Some of the things that he did were pretty twisted :) ). Another thing that I loved about the movie was how they blended the real world with the cartoon world. They did an amazing job at that (and it was only the 80's before all that other advanced crap came in).It was a well done movie. This movie has been a part of my life for so long, it's unforgettable. And though I'm almost an adult, Roger's still my absolute favorite (and I still have the doll that I got more than ten years ago!). I would say that this movie is for BOTH adults and kids. The adults get the mystery and humor of it and the kids get the cartoons out of it (I would say Roger especially; he's more wackier and irrevolent than the other cartoons). To the reader: I would GREATLY recommend you see this movie if you haven't already. I give it ***** 5/5!!",Null,1,1,13 August 2004
