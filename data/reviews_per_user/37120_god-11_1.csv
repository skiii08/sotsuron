Vertigo," in my opinion 'vertigo' is undoubtedly Hitchcock's masterpiece.
","i have seen 'vertigo' several times, each time being better than the first, and each time being with a greater sense of awe for the master of his genre. 'vertigo' is a film which cannot be looked at as a mystery, for it is not. 'vertigo' must be seen as a film of symbolism, surrealism, and tragedy.'vertigo' is not a mystery because it never asks us a question that we do not already know the answer to.  a scene exemplifying this, appears about halfway through the film.  a mid-point scene, which alters the direction of the second act, and acts as a second turning point.  (most films only have two, i believe this film has three).  The scene is classic Hitch, this revelation does not ruin surprise, or decrease the power of the climax.  moreover, it increases the climax by allowing us to be a party to scottie's psychosis.  instead of being on the sidelines for the second half of the film, we are in scottie's shoes. instead of us being third party and uninvolved with his condition, we are now with him in his fall from total sanity.i could go on for hours about symbolism and freudian psychology with this film, but alas, i am unable at this moment.",Null,2,4,3 November 1998
