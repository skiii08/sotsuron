Mission: Impossible III," Mission Impossible 3
","If you are a fan of the other MI movies, or any action movies like I am, you may think this will be a great movie. With a decent cast, and two decent prequels before it, this movie is bound to be good, right? Wrong. The movie is terribly under dramatic and rather unclear. The movie really is a mission impossible, and the movie is a cross between realistic action and fake gadget fighting. The movie also totally skips out on one of the main action scenes, so obviously this movie is not good if you are looking for a good action scene. If you are looking for a good all around movie that is another thing. This movie unlike X Men: The Last Stand, and many other action movies, is not pure fighting. In contrast there is a fair amount of 'quiet time' and even a touch of comedy. I give this movie 5/10 for a nice all around movie, but it is not the greatest out there of its genre.",5,0,1,30 May 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," X Men: The Last Stand Review
","The switching of the directors in X2 and this movie is clearly shown, much like it did in the Harry Potter movies. This is a very good action movie, but without seeing the other movies this movie is hard to understand. Also, there are too many mutants in this movie, as apposed to the first where there were to little. Many of the mutants have very small parts, and they even leave out mutants that were a key part in the second. The battle scenes seemed less real then the ones in the other two and the special effects were much worse. The movie is a good Â½hour shorter then the second and much less deep. Overall I give this 7/10 stars, it was a very good movie, but not as good as X2, and extremely choppy is some parts. On the bright side the movie had some very good quotes and some very good rivalries. I recommend this movie, just maybe not in theaters.",7,2,3,29 May 2006
