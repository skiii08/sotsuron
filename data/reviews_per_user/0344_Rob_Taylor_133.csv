Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill? Should be Kill Tarantino, more like...
","Awful, boring, slow and tedious are just a few words that spring to mind when I recall having to sit through Kill Bill Vol 2. And those are the kindest words I can think of. A few more choice words would be crap, s***e, rubbish or just plain retarded.Now, I admit, I wasn't expecting KB Vol 1 rehashed, but I did expect something not too dissimilar from Vol 2. KB2 is to KB1 as The Sound of Music is to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The first film's non-stop action has been replaced almost entirely by non-stop dialogue. And not particular good dialogue either. In fact, I'll coin a new term here - dire-logue. The film is littered with it. Any film requires a certain amount of exposition, and even mystic claptrap like that in the Matrix movies. But KB Vol 2 takes claptrap to a new level that makes the Matrix movies look positively Spartan in terms of jibber-jabber. But the worst thing about the chatter in KB2 is the total and utter meaninglessness of most of it. It just drones on and on. A character makes a point verbally then, instead of getting on with the movie, the character is forced to belabour the point over and over until you're practically screaming at them to shut the Hell up and get on with it!Nor do the pointlessly long (and in fact, just pointless) extra scenes add to the film in any way. For example, we learn that Bud (Bill's brother) lives in a trailer and has a crappy job at a local bar as a bouncer. He's become a loser - a far cry from his assassin days. What I've just summarized in two sentences is dragged out on film over the course of perhaps twenty minutes or more, including an entirely tedious and unnecessary set of scenes involving Bud at work that add absolutely nothing whatsoever to the film and introduce characters that have no bearing on the movie at all. Another scene involves the Bride talking to one of Bill's old colleagues in order to find out where Bill is located. This scene drags on terribly and gives the viewer pointless information on this character which again has precisely no bearing on the movie at all. The only scene which is worthy of inclusion is the obligatory training scene. This is a direct homage to many old Kung Fu movies, right down to the beard stroking sensei. But even this goes on unnecessarily and has you shifting uncomfortably in your seat. And although this scene ties in with the finale and burial scenes, it only serves to remind you that, whilst the Bride was seemingly unable to master punching her fist through a piece of wood, she was apparently highly enough thought of by Pai Mei (the sensei) that he taught her the 'hand of death' trick which he had previously never taught to anyone. Hmmm.The action sequences are brief and entirely unsatisfying for a movie based around the concept of revenge. Bud isn't even slain by the Bride, but by Elle using a Black Mamba (we know it's a Black Mamba because, as Bud is writhing in his death throes on the floor, Elle gives us a tedious five minute exposition on the snake). Elle isn't killed by the Bride, but rather maimed and left after a fight that was very scrappy and not at all elegant. And finally Bill, who is killed by the Bride (after endless boring dialogue about superheroes) in one of the most anticlimactic and disappointing 'final encounter' scenes I've ever witnessed.The truth of this movie is that it's really not a movie at all. It's the extra half-hour that they had to cut from the first film, padded out to two hours or so to make a sequel. With not even particularly brutal editing, KB2 could be distilled down into 30 minutes of relevant, interesting scenes and tacked on to KB1 to make that movie complete. Otherwise this bloated monstrosity is doomed to obscurity in the way that so many sequels so often are - due to over hype and audience expectations being too high.Quentin Tarantino is to be commended for his movie efforts on the most part. However, KB2 is little more than self-indulgent twaddle wrapped up as a film and served up for consumption on the strength of its predecessor. It's destined to become one of those 'I liked so-and-so, but the sequel was rubbish' type of deals. This is even more certain in the light of certain comments I read by Tarantino where he made a big deal of telling everyone that he was sparing no effort in the editing room. If this film is an example of his editing skills, I'd say he needs to be evicted from post-production facilities and the door locked securely behind him to ensure he can't get back in.",1,123,255,30 April 2004
Alien 3," The weakest of the four films to date
","Alien 3 is not a bad film but it is the weakest of the four that have been made. Its just nowhere near as good as it could have been. If you take the premise that sequels need to introduce something new in order to keep the audience interest and progress the story, then this movie doesn't do a lot. The only new thing I learned about the aliens from this film, is that they can apparently use any creature as a host and that the resulting alien offspring inherit some of the characteristics of the host. And thats all.Alien introduced us to the alien, Aliens gave us the hive structure and the rest of the breeding cycle, this gave us very little more, apart from the fact that most criminals appear to be English.The casual killing off of two of the survivors from Aliens was a really weak way to get them out of the way at the start of the film.This film is basically a rehashing of the first one - a single alien and a bunch of people fighting it with limited resources. Not good, not bad, just average.",6,389,407,17 December 2002
Mission: Impossible III," Mission Implausible 3
","Yawn......Here we go, another foolish pseudo-spy story. Well, it was better than the last one, at least, but still utterly predictable and dull, despite the supposed action sequences.The problem with this type of movie isn't the silly spy-tech gadgets and the laughable concepts of supervillains, wild car and helicopter chases through cities, etc. It's the lack of intelligence when it comes to the realisation of any of these things.For example. One of the more interesting moments is a helicopter chase sequence. You basically have a venerable old Huey being pursued by a Cobra attack helicopter. Now, I'm no expert at helicopter tactics or design. But I'm guessing that a Cobra will run circles around a Huey all day long without breaking a sweat. Granted, a Huey might have longer range, but in a chase, that isn't gonna matter much. But the thing that annoyed me most, was the singular lack of anything resembling a brain in the scene-planning. Sure, it was cool to have the helicopters flying through a veritable forest of giant wind-turbines, but even an idiot would realise the Cobra didn't have to be there. Assuming the pilot training is above average for gunship pilots, you'd think it'd be sensible to fly above the turbines? And maybe fire down into them? Not fly through them? Bah! It's this kind of idiocy that ruins a movie experience for me. And when that happens, I start picking holes in everything else that I'd normally gloss-over.Such as the explosion whose shock wave radiates out, realises it's missed Tombo, then does a ninety degree turn to knock him sideways into a car. Looks good, until you think about it even a tiny amount.Another thing which bugs me is Cruise himself. I'm not sure if it's all the controversy that surrounds him these days, but I find myself far less forgiving of him as an actor now. His acting range seems to be limited to frowns, rictus grins, slight head-twitches and bug-eyed insane staring. And he uses this 'repertoire' to convey every emotion required of him in a scene, from love to hate. It's actually quite unnerving to watch in some instances.Suffice to say, if you can switch off your brain and just let it all wash over you, then this is an OK movie. But, if like me, you're cursed with an IQ greater than that of the average sock puppet, then you'll find it all just a tad irritating.",5,9,18,28 June 2006
Sucker Punch," It's a little bit different and that's no bad thing.
","Sucker Punch is a deceptively simple film. It's deceptive in that it appears to be a clever movie. But it really isn't.Don't get me wrong. It's nice to see a movie that isn't just a straightforward scene by scene celluloid tale. Sucker Punch manages quite well to convince you that it is deeper and more meaningful than it is whilst telling a simple story of an escape from an asylum.The 'clever' part is that where an ordinary movie would show and make drama out of the actual steps necessary to escape in reality, Sucker Punch tells these moments through the alternate reality envisaged by the main protagonist, a girl known simply as Baby Doll.Her flights of fantasy are quite unusual, and very well done for the most part. Essentially the struggle to obtain the necessary items to effect their escape in real-life are obtained in the fantasy segments through the simple resort of slicing and dicing and running and gunning their way through various enemies.As I mentioned, the fantasy elements are well done and realised and couple of those segments are interesting enough that I wouldn't mind a movie based entirely on their concepts.However, not all is good in this movie. For a start, the characters are so thinly sketched that it is hard to feel any kind of empathy for them, or their plight. The fantasy segments, though executed well, only show the girls in a positive, empowered light, making it difficult to link the asylum girls plight to that of the ass-kicking, scantily clad beauties seen therein.Additionally in one of the fantasy scenes the girls fail to complete their mission, leading to their failure to secure an item. However, later this item is seen in their hidden storage area and is used by Baby Doll as if the mission had been a success. Continuity error? Or intentional error to highlight the fantastic nature of the story? I wasn't sure.However, I was sure the 'reality' sections of the film were meant to be set in the fifties. So it seemed logical that any fantasies that sprung out of the mind of someone living in that era would be limited to the technology of that era. So whilst I can accept the steampunk-esque clockwork and steam-powered nazi zombies, I'm less inclined to believe LCD displays and a Huey helicopter. Were their 'Nam style helo's in the fifties? I'm sure there were many other anachronistic items that I didn't notice.The worst thing to come out of this film, though, is Zack Snyder's insistence that he made the movie to 'empower' women. Empower them how, exactly? By dressing them up like Japanese anime characters? By having them enact massive amounts of violence with guns and swords? Fantasy, it may be, but it sure ain't any female fantasy. This has the whiff of over-testosteroned male excess about it. As such, it's pretty easy to see its target demographic - young men.I don't mind films like this - in fact I quite enjoy them. But I dislike those responsible for them pretending they are something better than what they actually are.So to summarise then. Reasonably entertaining and slightly different. Characters you don't really care about. Interesting fantasy elements. Made out to be better than it actually is. Worth a watch, but nothing like as special as some would have you believe.",6,0,5,26 June 2011
10 Cloverfield Lane," No, it really isn't a sequel to Cloverfield. Not at all.
","Okay, before I start, a word about the negative reviews about this film. Most of them seem to fall into a category I'll generously label as 'It said Cloverfield in the title! WTF!' Said reviews are from people who erroneously assumed it was a sequel to Cloverfield because of the name. It isn't. Nor is it really anything to do with Cloverfield the movie, or that universe. Abrams himself muddied the waters a little and isn't without blame because he called it a 'spiritual cousin' to the original.However, what 10 Cloverfield Lane is, is a movie in the same vein, but not at all alike. A bit like Star Wars and Star Trek are both scifi films, but expecting one to be a sequel to the other just because they have the word 'Star' in them is the height of idiocy. Same deal with this movie. You can safely ignore those reviews because the majority of them are written by disgruntled Cloverfield fans.Now, on to this film. Is it any good, and what is it really about? Well, it is at its heart a thriller of sorts, with a healthy dose of mystery and 'what the hell is going on?' thrown in for good measure. With a cast of just three people for the majority of the running time it manages to keep the tension going nicely.It would be hard to say much more without ruining the movie entirely, but most things are revealed and wrapped up by the end. Whether or not it comes across as satisfying is entirely down to what your expectations are going in and what you are expecting to see (hence my comments about the negative reviews above). If you go in with an open mind, you might just find it more enjoyable and satisfying.Performances are good throughout, but Goodman is the standout here. Forget his usual lovable rogue routine. He goes to an entirely different place in this film.The ending is controversial if it isn't what you were expecting, but it is also surprising. I think, ultimately, that using the word 'Cloverfield' in the title was an attempt to let potential viewers in on the... unusual and unexpected... ending. I think they wanted to not let the cat out of the bag, but just poke it so it mewed a little and gave people an idea of what to expect. Sadly, as note, some people took it too literally and were disappointed as a result.That's not to say the ending is particularly good. Everything that comes before it is somewhat cheapened by the sudden descent into... action... that ensues, and it is thematically a seemingly tacked on experience. You could quite literally swap out the last ten minutes for any number of other endings and they would all work just as well (or not, depending on your personal liking). The ending that you get, however, is quite striking.Altogether though, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller with a few twists that left me happy I decided to watch it. You could do worse.SUMMARY: Decent thriller with a name that left too many expecting the wrong thing. Excellent performance from John Goodman playing against type and with an ending that is a Marmite moment for a lot of people. Worth the effort, however, if only for Goodman's performance.",7,0,2,6 May 2016
The Finest Hours," The Baddest Melodrama...
","So, when a movie proudly proclaims 'Based upon a true story' I have learned over the years to expect one of two things.Either, it will take a real story, butcher it mercilessly but somehow still manage to make an entertaining film. Or, it will take a real story, butcher it mercilessly and then dare you to find fault with it because it is 'based on a true story'.The Finest Hours is in the latter camp, sadly. The story of a brave sea rescue sounds just dandy in synopsis form, but the realisation of that rescue just ended being badly executed.The first problem is the utterly unnecessary 'love-interest' story tacked on to the movie. If you completely removed the Miriam character from the movie we would have a simple one hour thirty movie about a rescue at sea. But no, because of the 'Scriptwriter 101' Bible, we have this romantic subplot badly shoehorned into the movie. And it is bad, trust me. Miriam's character comes across as horribly needy and controlling - in short, an unlikable character - and serves no useful purpose to the film's main story, except as a means to break up the sea scenes. Additionally, her character is entirely at odds with the time she is in. Jarringly so, in fact. But Disney, I guess, couldn't have a hero without having the obligatory 'woman waiting for him to return' on shore plot.Beyond that, when we finally get to the rescue, I expected some sort of crazy maneuvering by the coast guard ship, or some clever way to get the men from the stricken tanker onto the rescue boat.But no, apparently basing a movie on a real life story and mucking it up a lot didn't include the notion of making this pivotal sequence interesting. So instead of something clever, we are treated to men climbing down a ladder and jumping either into the sea, or directly onto the lifeboat.There is some good in the film. Pretty much any of the scenes aboard the tanker are nicely done and far more interesting than watching the antics of either Chris Pine (who here acts as woodenly as his name), or his pushy, control-freak of a girlfriend.The tanker crew's struggle shows where all of the imagination in this script was. In fact, if the movie had been told primarily from their perspective with the coast guard crew as a secondary plot, and little miss annoying nowhere to be seen, then the movie would have been far more satisfying.As it is, however, the film is somewhat dull and heavily weighted down by its own suffocating melodrama. Far too cloying.SUMMARY: Horrible romantic subplot, dull rescue scenes and entirely too much melodrama to make this one worthwhile. Characters that all seem to be in various stages of depression. Perfect Storm, this ain't!",5,3,8,14 May 2016
Iron Man 3," Iron Man? Iron out the wrinkles, more like!
","There is a tendency with all sequels for bigger, better, more flashy. A need to have a bigger menace, more capable foes, more, more, more.In the case of Iron Man 3 they crossed the threshold and went too far. I've always liked Iron Man (as opposed to the other super hero movies) because it seems to be more realistic and achievable. In other words, science fiction, rather than crazy hokum dreamed up by someone on crack. Iron Man had a basis in reality far stronger than the rest, and that is why I liked it more.Sadly, with its drug-induced lava humans who can melt anything but suffer no damage, it went beyond the boundary of what I think was acceptable for this franchise.Add in the fact that the whole movie plays out (for most of the film) like a Bond movie with nary a sight of Iron Man in action, and you can't help but wonder when the action will begin.The biggest failing was in the needless visual gags, usually centred around Tony Stark putting on his armour (which seems to have become a swarm-like entity in its own right) and which involve slapstick-like comedy not seen since the days of the Three Stooges. Once or twice this might have been humorous. But it happens time after time, as if they couldn't think of anything else to do with it.There are good things in the movie, such as Stark's character's journey from neurosis back to hero, and the fact that they finally gave Gwynneth Paltrow something to do other than stare into Robert Downey's eyes longingly. But the good parts are outweighed by the stupidity in trying to do too much and 'push the limits' of what the character can do.SUMMARY: Overblown and overdone. Comedy from your grandad's era. Utter nonsense passed off as science, but without the decency to call it homeopathy. Easily the weakest of the three Iron Man films to date.",7,0,1,25 May 2013
The Ring," The Ring! It's my preciousssss! Not.
","Spoilers contained within.OK, this was mildly entertaining. Not at all scary, but entertaining. But either I'm vastly more intelligent than 90% of the population of the world, or Hollywood just portrays people as plain stupid. From the first time we see the video play through, I guessed quite correctly, that the 'Ring' was someone looking up from inside the well as the lid is put on. It was just so obvious. Yet the characters take an age to figure it out and never seem to look for a well wherever they go. They never think to rewatch the video for clues, either. After all, if they're gonna die, why not watch it repeatedly? They might have made the connection with the well and the ring then.Anyway, they watch the video (once each), get a phone call, then begin to die off. The characters investigate with Scooby-Doo efficiency and finally get to the bottom of things (sorry, couldn't resist that pun).It's not bad, much better than I expected, but you'll probably grit your teeth at the characters' slowness of thought. I haven't seen the original, so I can't compare the two. But this played out like an episode of the X-Files really, but without the imaginative Mulder to come up with wild theories as to what was going on.It's worth a watch, though.",Null,0,1,30 June 2003
It," It sinks... It all sinks down here...
","So, as far as adaptations go of Stephen King works, this is one of the better ones. I should qualify that by saying that, although decent, it is by no means a mirror of the book. In fact, the earlier mini-series starring Tim Curry was a more faithful adaptation in that respect. However, when we consider the usual butchery done to King's stories when translated to film, this isn't the worst offender by far.With all that out of the way, you'll note I have given the film a middling five score. The main reason for that is simple. The movie relies entirely on jump scares and strident Inception-like horn blasts for its scares. It is, essentially, the horror movie equivalent of a laughter track, designed to prompt the audience to be afraid. However, once this formula becomes apparent to the viewer in a movie - any movie - its power to scare you actually diminishes almost to zero.A lot of so-called horror movies rely on this audience prompting. It's sad in a way, because I'm old enough to remember when old horror movies of the 70's and 80's realised this mistake and tried at least to change it up so that not every jump scare (or setup for a jump scare) actually resulted in a 'shock'. Nowadays, it seems like modern film-makers have forgotten even that much guile when they make such movies. Or maybe they just don't care to make a movie that keeps you on your toes anymore. Or perhaps, they just don't care.So, It isn't a very scary horror movie. It relies too much (entirely, really) on these jump scares and an amount of gore that, sadly, is all too present in these types of efforts.As a movie it does its job reasonably well. I mentioned earlier that it isn't a bad adaptation of King's book. Certainly it is miles better than the recent Dark Tower mess. However, the story isn't fleshed out sufficiently to make you really care about the characters and, honestly, this Pennywise is far less creepy and disturbing than Tim Curry's version.Once again, I am forced to conclude that King's books are better in a serialised format rather than a standalone movie (though this is set up to be a duology). Accordingly, things feel rushed and some of the editing is a bit abrupt. There's no steady build-up. Just a succession of jump scares and thinly dealt with backstories.It's not terrible, but neither is it as good as you might be led to believe.SUMMARY: Jump scares! Loud noises! Gore! Thin characterisations and rushed story. Tried to pack too much into too little. Typical horror tropes that drag it down into the sewer. It doesn't float, it sinks.",5,1,2,30 October 2017
Minority Report," Minority Report is a good, solid mystery film.
","SPOILERS AHEADMinority Report is a good, solid mystery film. When I first saw the trailers, I was convinced I knew what was going on...that it was, in fact a clone of the hero that had committed the murder. How wrong could I be? The film will keep you guessing until about the last twenty minutes or so, when it all becomes clear.The special effects are decent enough, though I spotted one tiny error regarding the case numbers. When they first begin to look at the murder the hero is supposed to commit, it's assigned a number 1109. But when he's reviewing the images on the big 'monitor' you can see the number 1108 at the top. 1108 being the murder they showed previously in order to set the scene and take the audience through how things worked.One other minor gripe. The precogs can apparently tell who is being murdered and who is the murderer...they name names! But they can't tell where the murder is being committed? But then it gives the cops something to do, trying to figure out where a murder is being committed, I suppose.A couple of minor bugs, though, in an otherwise great movie. Well worth a look if you are a fan of cop drama, scifi or just plain old mystery movies.There are a number of people that don't get this movie, which is puzzling, since it really isn't anything more than a whodunnit set in the future. A very good whodunnit, which'll keeping you guessing for a long time, but still that's all it really is.Funnily enough, those that don't get this, also don't get films like Vanilla Sky, which is another movie that keeps you wondering until the end. Could it be that Hollywood has successfully weaned people off intelligent movies and on to bland, action-oriented fare like Die Another Day? I hope not. But then, a friend recently saw The Two Towers and reported there were people in the audience who didn't understand the simple concept of flashbacks, which is pretty scary.Anyway, watch it and judge for yourself.",9,1,2,26 December 2002
John Wick," Mindless, enjoyable, violence...
","I think part of the reason that I enjoyed this movie so much was that yesterday I watched Taken 3. That action movie was such a steaming pile of ineptitude that it makes John Wick look like Shakespeare in comparison.John Wick has its faults. Believability being the obvious one. But it believes in itself just enough to carry it off and not descend into farce, though it skirts that point very closely at times.One of the big draws for me here was the fight choreography. Plenty of thought went in to the extended action sequences and there was some imaginative use of the surroundings. Add to the fact that the shots are held long enough to let you see what is going on and the action is thoroughly enjoyable.There is plenty of violence and plenty of blood. Though not overly graphic or gratuitous, it doesn't shy away from it either. There are bodies, and blood, galore after every shoot out.It is difficult to describe the level of the action here, but the thing it most closely reminded me of was the 'gun kata' motif from Equilibrium. If you liked that movie, then the general flow from one target to the next that Wick performs here will be immediately familiar.Story-wise, it is a simple revenge tale and the reasons for the warpath mentality of Wick are spelled out in the first twenty minutes or so. After that it is all action, pretty much.If the action had been done badly (a la the aforementioned Taken 3) or the fights hadn't been interesting, then this would have been a tedious bore-fest. But thankfully, all is well in that department and, as a result, the movie is enjoyable. Repeat viewing... maybe not so much. But I can think of many worse movies to sit through a second time.SUMMARY: Imaginative fight scenes elevate this above many similar action movies. Simple plot and larger than life characters. Well worth a watch and can probably be considered as Hollywood's answer to movies like The Raid.",7,24,43,25 January 2015
Star Trek," Rather better than I had feared!
","Soooo...They made a Star Trek movie. They made it using Kirk, McCoy and Spock et al, but not the original actors. Oooookay. Not happy about that.This was my initial reaction to the announcement of this film.Having seen it, I'm actually very pleased to have been proved wrong. See, I grew up with Shatner, Nimoy and the rest. So when Next Gen came out, I was disposed not to like that. It won me over (well....apart from Wesley Crusher, anyhow). Same with all the other spin-off series. But when it came to replacing those iconic first characters! How dare they! Who could step into those shoes and do a good job? Well, it appears, the cast of Star Trek have done just that. Some of them, it has to be said, are more comfortable and convincing in their roles than others. But none of them suck.Most of the objection to this film seems to centre around either the cast being replaced, or the fact that 'the timeline has been altered!' I've addressed the former, but here's some thoughts on the timeline thing.See, I'll be the first to agree that Trek overuses time travel. It's become like the only futuristic tech thing they can come up with. It is a big yawn. But the argument here that 'they've invalidated all of the rest of the Trek canon!' is really both naive and rather simplistically childish. Has no one who watched this movie not also watched any other time travel movie involving branching timelines? Alternatively, try reading any book by Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist, for some ideas of what could be possible.Anyhow, back to the film. Is it any good? Well, yes. There are plot holes in it - big ones. Holes you could fly the Enterprise through and not touch the sides. And the plot - minus the holes - is still a pretty simple save the galaxy affair. But it is enjoyable, and it is fun.Even when the new actors utter the old classic lines of dialogue, it just raises a warm feeling inside, rather than the horrible cringing I had expected to experience.And as for the fact that 'the past has been changed' so what? All that means is a greater creative freedom to take the series in new directions. Let's face it, what else was going to happen? Another spin-off series with more of the same old, same old? Another Next Gen movie? The franchise needed a new breath of life. Hopefully this is it. Let's see what they come up with next.",8,3,8,23 November 2009
Fury," Well, I somewhat enjoyed it, but....
","It would have been nice if...They had someone who actually had any inkling of tank battle tactics to do the choreography for those scenes. A Tiger tank would not simply sit in one place whilst another tank went behind it. It would either pivot in place to keep its superior forward glacis facing the enemy, or just back away from the approaching tank to acccomplish the same thing. Likewise, in open terrain, there was no need for the tanks in that particular battle to be as close as they were. In short, it was dumb.It would also have been nice if they had someone who could just point out that the behaviour of the German SS in the final battle was just ludicrous. Oh look! There's an American tank at a crossroads. It looks like it is destroyed. Let's not send some scouts ahead to check, but just all bundle up to it as if we aren't in the middle of a frickin' war! And, once the ruse was uncovered, the SS all act like completely inept lemmings, throwing themselves repeatedly at the tank armed with ineffectual sidearms.I suspect the point of the movie was to show that war is hell and good people can turn bad, but there was really nothing much likable about the tank crew at all. Most of them came across as loud-mouth, drunken jocks for the most part. In the end, their deaths meant little to me as a viewer and even the token act of kindness at the end had me rolling my eyes.Some people have praised the 'realism' of this movie, but honestly, there isn't much on display here.But... you said you enjoyed it! Well, yes i said I somewhat enjoyed it. Putting aside the nonsense above, I enjoyed the acting on display. Even Brad Pitt wasn't as wooden as normal and I was pleasantly surprised by Shia LaBoeuf and Jon Bernthal, though the latter is getting typecast as an a-hole I think. The cast gave it their all, though Jason Isaacs was wasted in his token role.Though I disliked the characters, the actors made me believe they were real enough. It is just a shame the plot wasn't up to the task of being as believable.SUMMARY: Some nice acting, but unlikable characters and woeful lack of common sense in the action scenes make this a bit of a chore to wade through. A nice idea, but needed a few more technical advisors, methinks.",6,1,6,26 January 2015
Fight Club," Well worth watching if you like movies that make you think.
","A pretty good movie on the whole, and one of the increasing crop which actually make you think about what's going on a little. There's plenty of violence and action, but that is just the shallow surface of this film. There's a lot more going on under the surface than is apparent.Others have already summarized the plot quite well, so I'll just say it's a worthwhile movie to watch and it's particularly nice to see Meat Loaf in a film again, albeit with big tits!",8,0,1,29 December 2002
Dawn of the Dead," Wow! A remake worthy of the original!
","Yep, it is rare that remakes do much for me. Usually they're crappily done rehashes that lose all of the original's charm and messages (if any). Either that, or they 're-imagine' the original (God, I hate that term!) and muck the original about so much that you wonder why they gave it the same name (eg. Battlestar Galactica)But in DoD we get a movie that, like the original, is full of dark humour and menace, updated for today's audience. The original Romero version was good, and remains one of my favourites of all time. But this remake can stand proudly alongside it without feeling inferior in any way.The plot is virtually the same. People fleeing from zombies hold up inside a mall and try to wait out the apocalypse. This version has a whole lot more characters, although I'm giving nothing away by saying most of them die, and a few new ideas thrown in.The zombies owe more to Boyle's '28 Days Later' than they do to Romero's shambling originals. But that serves only to make them more menacing, since you can't necessarily outrun/outmaneuver them easily.The characters are reasonably stereotypical. But it is nice to see a movie where the heroes have ordinary jobs and aren't all ex-Green Berets or Navy Seals. Just average Joes and Janes. In fact, the most competent (in this kind of situation) individuals are a cop and some security guards, and none of them are eager to take charge (except one of the security guys, and he's messed up).There isn't a huge amount of character development. In fact, the aforementioned security guard undergoes the biggest development, losing his selfish attitude and becoming one of the more likable characters of the group.Needless to say, the group diminishes in size as the film progresses, lost to the zombies mostly, though with the occasional accident thrown in for good measure.There are a few things to mar this film. If you were trapped in a gun shop and had thousands of rounds of ammunition, wouldn't you just kill as many zombies from the rooftop as you could? What would be the point in not shooting them? Similarly, when using gas containers as bombs to be shot at as they lie on the ground, why not tape thousands of nails and screws to them and make them even more dangerous? But these are minor gripes more concerned with what I would do in that situation, rather than actual movie problems. In fact, most of the characters act with far more intelligence than you are used to seeing in a horror film, which in itself is a refreshing change.But, on the whole, this film scores highly for entertainment and rewatchability. There's plenty of gore to keep the splatter fans happy and plenty of fear for the easily frightened to bite their fingernails at. Likewise lots of 'Yeah!' moments to cheer at.Easily the best movie I've watched this year.",8,0,0,29 August 2004
Alien: Resurrection," A good film on the whole and a worthy fourth installment.
","There's something rather sinister about Sigourney Weaver in this fourth installment of the series. She's part alien herself. In a way, this twist is much more interesting than the aliens themselves, which we've all become familiar with by now. The aliens run around, killing people or dragging them off to be hosts for more aliens etc etc... yada yada.But Ripley is new and improved. Pretty much right off I had a certainty that she was not only going to survive, but not even be really tested by the aliens this time. And I wasn't disappointed. She was far more deadly than they were. No the focus became would she side with the humans or aliens. And which of the humans would survive.The rest of the story is pretty standard fare for the series. Foolish humans capture aliens, aliens escape, kill humans, remaining humans fight for survival and a way of escape. Nothing new really.Ron Perlman has a good part, although it's his usual tough guy role, and he has some good scenes. Brad Dourif is just plain creepy as the mad scientist in love with the aliens. That guy scares me! Which goes a long way to saying he's a good actor, I guess.But on the whole the movie is carried by Ripley's character to the extent that you don't care about any of the others, you just want to see what Ripley will do next.Of course, the lame mutant alien at the end is just truly awful and reminded me of one of the muppets from the Muppet Show (without the hair and with more slime, of course) and was just well....crap. Truly worthy of derision.A good film on the whole and a worthy fourth installment.",9,1,2,17 December 2002
World War Z," World War Zzzzzzzz......Zzzzzzzz......Zzzzzz
","I wanted so much for this film to be good. I really did. Yet I knew, deep down in my core that, having seen the 'swarming' zombies, it was going to be painful. It was, but not for the reasons the trailer suggested. In fact, the swarming, ant-like behaviour of the zombies is a minor thing compared to the rest of the this terrible, terrible film.1. Acting. I've never been convinced by Brad Pitt in any of his roles. He's the thinking man's cure for insomnia. Here, he seems to just not care enough to make an effort. He does his scenes and delivers his lines but he just flat out fails to be the 'hero'. I can't remember a film where the main character was so... uninteresting. He's just a nothing character and Pitt plays him without any emotion or energy whatsoever.2. Characterization. All of the characters are laser-cut out of cardboard, complete with little foldout bits to make them stand up. Such a bland, uninteresting bunch you won't find outside of an Asylum movie. The wife is helpless and annoyingly needy. The children were clearly told to just 'scream a lot'. Nobody else even gets that much development. It's awful because, without any character to the characters, you don't give a damn about any of them.3. Stupidity. There's a whole boatload in this film. Whether it's the nonsensical decision to send just a handful of soldiers with Pitt and the 'expert' (tm) off on a mission even though there are assault carriers full of marines on hand, or the inane 'invisibility' cloak that terminal disease conferred on the victims, this movie is dumb. Israel builds a wall around their entire country to keep the zombies out. Great! Except that they then don't bother to patrol said wall at all, allowing the stackable lego-zombies to scale the outside unimpeded. The zombies can sense ill people at a run and completely ignore them. Never mind that a sick dude could be bitten and pass on the virus just as well as a healthy person. Ah, but of course, the reason for that is...4. Plot-Driven story. These are always the weakest movies, because they force characters and situations in order to fit the plot. So in the above example, the reason the zombies don't bite sick folk is solely so that Arm Pitt can infect himself later on in the film in order to escape death at their hands. In other words, a terribly obvious plot device.The biggest indicator that a movie has failed to deliver, however, came when I found a minor character more interesting than the main character. In this case it was the Israeli soldier girl. Forget Pitt, she's the real star of the movie. But the fact that she outshines the main character is a clear sign that all is not well with the film.There's also no context in which to place the movie's events. You just get dumped straight in with no explanation of where the virus came from, or why, or how Israel knew to build a wall and so on.It's a mess, honestly, and tries to hide that fact behind action set-pieces and CGI effects with minimal success.With a better main star and perhaps a better written screenplay, it might have been engaging. As it is, it is a bit of a snorefest. Utterly predictable storyline and blatant plot manipulation do nothing to enhance its appeal.SUMMARY: There are many better zombie movies out there. And none of them have Brad Pitt in them.",5,2,5,8 September 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Destined to become a cult movie.
","Yes, it was refreshing to see a non-Hollywood movie. Particularly as this one doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. I admit to having my doubts, especially when I heard that FilmFour was involved. In the past I've either hated or loved films that they've had a hand in, wioth no middle ground. And, on balance, I tend to hate them more than I like them.However, in SOTD's case I loved it. I can imagine that some of the humour will go over the heads of non-Brits, as the comedy in SOTD is very British. However, that doesn't stop it from being a fun movie throughout.It was also nice to see the affectionate homages to classic zombie films of the past, such as Day of the Dead et al. There were probably more little nods at the genre than I noticed but the two ones that stood out to me were the entrail-ripping scene and, right at the end as the credits roll, the music playing is the music from Dawn of the Dead (original) as the zombies enter the mall and go shopping.As I note in the header, this one is almost assured of becoming a cult movie. It has all the right elements and none of the wrong ones. Watch it and see what you think.",8,1,2,27 August 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Starts a little slowly, but builds nicely.
","Sequels rarely live up to the original's ideals and energy, so I wasn't expecting much going into this. I thought my fears would be justified for the first 45 minutes or so seem not to go anywhere quickly. Of course, being made back-to-back with the third film in mind, this movie was always destined to be the 'middle' chapter. And middle chapters are historically weak in comparison to the start and finish episodes of a trilogy.However, after the first hour or so of tom-foolery things began to build quite well in terms of scope, foolishness and general action, until the last half hour or so pretty much flew by. In particular, the whole series of scenes from the search on the beach for the chest onwards is just delightfully ridiculous.Although there didn't seem to be the same level of foolishness on the part of Depp this time out, I think that everyone increases their level of madcap antics leading to him not 'outshining' everyone else. Of course, he still does, but everyone seems to be hamming it up a lot more this time. Strangely though, that doesn't drag the film down at all. Just gives it more energy.Overall, a worthy middle episode that, though sluggish to start, finishes with a glorious climax and only leaves you waiting with anticipation for the final chapter.Easily the most fun movie I've watched so far this year!",9,4,7,6 August 2006
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek: Into Parody
","Well, I did enjoy it for the most part, but it is a far paler shadow of even its predecessor, much less the old Trek films. Because this movie was at times grimace inducing or caused groans of pain (from me beating my head against the seat in front of me), I cannot in good faith give a serious review of it. And, since it's been a long time since I did one of these, here it comes...Things I learned from this movie which make no sense whatsoever...1. Cold fusion devices really are cold. Cold enough to freeze a volcano!2. Water literally just offshore is more than deep enough to hide an entire starship!3. Old Spock is now the 'We don't know what to do, so we'll call him!' guy.4. Khan is so skilled at everything that he can manage to design and build super photon torpedoes and then manage to squirrel away his entire crew of frozen supermen inside them, and nobody ever notices the corpsicles are missing from wherever they were being stored!5. The new Klingons are pussies.6. Sound only exists in a vacuum if its dramatically necessary.7. Gigantic crashing starships displace no air as they fall.In addition, here's a handy checklist of previous Trek lore that Abrams felt it was important to include. I can only presume that these were included so that people would remember they were supposedly watching a Star Trek movie and not some hokey sci-fi space actioner riffing on it.1. Old Spock in movie? Check! 2. Destroyed Klingon moon Praxis? Check!3. The needs of the many...yada, yada...? Check! 4. Reference to Harry Mudd? Check! 5. Tribble? Check! 6. KHAAAAAAN!? Check!These items are most important, because otherwise you will wonder whether you are watching a Star Trek movie.You know, I was quite excited when I heard Abrams was doing the new Star Wars movie. But now I'm dreading it. He needs to ditch his Larry, Mo and Curly writing team for a start. Those stooges are seriously dragging him down. I don't think they've had an original idea in years and its painful to watch anything they've written these days. J.J., take a chance on a new scriptwriter, please! The Yuk-yuk brothers aren't doing you any favours.Back to Star Trek Into Darkness...No, it isn't that good. Eye candy and explosions, sometimes hard to see due to the overuse of the trademark Abram's lens-flare. Physics that makes no sense and a plot that was hacked up (furball-like!) in a short time indeed.The only real creativity in this movie are the designs of the CGI artists, prop makers and costume departments.SUMMARY: Give your five year old kid a cup of strong coffee and hand him a model of the Enterprise. I guarantee he'll be more entertaining to watch, but not as manic or hyperactive as this film. Overdone, Under-scripted and weak in comparison to every Star Trek movie before it. Older fans of the franchise might be better off just watching The Wrath of Khan instead. At least there the main complaint is simple overacting.FINAL THOUGHT: If starships can land on planets, what the hell are the shuttlecraft for?",6,3,10,21 August 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Very entertaining viewing
","I've never read the Narnia Chronicles (gasp!) so I came to this movie with very few preconceptions. And I have to say the film was a pleasant enough diversion for a couple of hours.As one might expect, the movie is heavily dependent upon CGI effects for its realisation, but it would be a terrible inaccuracy to say that it depended on them for its entertainment. True, the animal inhabitants and fantastic beasts of Narnia are all the better for the CGI treatment, but its the actors (and voices) that really make the movie worthwhile. In particular, the young stars of the film playing the Pevensey children are outstanding and I'm sure we'll be seeing more of them in the future.It's rare also that I spot something particularly well done amongst the omnipresent CGI effects these days - usually its quite the reverse, but I did here. In the large final battle feline warriors of both sides charge and leap at each other. The way the cats meet each other and twist in the air will be immediately familiar to anyone who has owned cats, particularly kittens, and watched them fighting. These brief scenes are exceptionally well-done and hats off to the CGI artists for this.The animals are not overtly anthropomorphised either, which is nice. They speak, and make head gestures rather nicely like a human might. But the features aren't too 'altered', if you know what I mean.As for the story, you are either familiar with it (having read the books) or ignorant of it (like me) but the basic plot is instantly familiar and recognisable. Good vs. Evil etc. and the ending is exactly as you might expect it to turn out.That said, the film is enjoyable thanks to the cast and effects and I'm sure we'll be seeing more of Narnia in the future.",7,0,0,30 December 2005
Happy Gilmore," Harmless fun and entertaining.
","I must admit, I sat down to watch this movie expecting to see the Sandler trademark character who has mental/emotional problems. Whilst this is true to the extent that Happy Gilmore has chronic anger management issues, it falls short of the usual 'character who has no grasp of the real world' which so often has predominated in Sandler films. Instead, Happy is savvy enough to know when he's being mocked and more than Happy (no pun intended) to beat the crap out of anyone who does so.The story is entirely predictable. However, you don't mind this, as with such films, the fun and entertainment comes not from being uncertain what is going to happen next, but rather from the anticipation of what you know will happen in due course.All the cast give great comic performances, though I felt more use could have been made of Sandler's homeless caddy. For the most part he just stands around. Likewise, Ben Stiller's minor role of the evil nursing home attendant ended rather abruptly. I was expecting a showdown between Stiller and Sandler over the former's treatment of Sandler's grandmother, but it never happened. I suspect this was a cut-scene, as I can't imagine the two of them not seeing the great potential in such a confrontation.The only really negative thing I can say about this movie (and it is really a generic failing of Hollywood that I've noticed in several movies lately) is the reliance on audience knowledge of cameo characters in order to get laughs. Just who is Bob Barker? I have no idea and I suspect a lot of the non-American audience will have no idea either. To me the whole fight scene on the golf course between Sandler and Barker was nowhere near as funny as I imagine it would be if I had any inkling of who he (Barker) was.But overall the film delivers plenty of gentle humour and the occasional guffaw. Well worth a look, even if you've been turned off by Sandler's characters in the past. For me, Sandler has taken a turn (albeit a modest one) in the right direction with his characters here.",7,1,1,1 October 2003
Ted," Family Guy + Live Action = Unfunny Movie
","This is proof positive that what works in cartoons doesn't translate well to live action. In cartoons, we don't have the real world, so the stupid humor and simple bodily-function jokes work, to a large extent. Translate that same humor to a live action movie and it really hits you how dumb and puerile it is.Ted, for a start, is inherently unlikeable as a character. To make matters worse, Wahlberg's character is equally hard to empathise with. He spends his days smoking pot with Ted and watching old movies. Both are horribly selfish.As an example of the sort of humor that you are supposed to find funny I give you this: Upon returning home - to her apartment, no less - Kunis' character finds Ted doing drugs with four prostitutes. That isn't the 'funny' part. The supposed humor comes from the fact that, for a dare, one of the hookers has taken a dump on the floor. Cue lots of laughter, right? No? Oh, well then, you must not find it funny either.This is the kind of humor throughout Ted. Fart and knob jokes, drug-related mirth and other terribly unfunny lines. I guess when you write, star and direct a film you can start to believe your own press, but this is ridiculous.McFarlane should stick to cartoons. At the very least, he could have tried to make Ted NOT sound exactly like Peter Griffin. They even crack a 'joke' about it at one point. Ha, ha! The basic plot is excruciatingly obvious from the start and means you can leave within twenty minutes and know exactly what will happen in the movie. I chuckled a few times, but Ted is far, far, far from funny. Most of the time any attempts at humor fall flat and sometimes the humor is just plain offensive.Ted is a movie aimed a teens, and pretty juvenile and immature teens at that. It falls neatly into line behind such other recent 'comedy' classics as Your Highness, and really makes you wonder how films like this can get greenlit by studios. Is there nothing more worthy to make into a film? SUMMARY: Don't believe the hype! It's overlong, tedious, unfunny and a waste of two hours. Ted is charmless and boring. I've had more fun sat staring at a dead fly in a dentist's waiting room for thirty minutes. Seriously, give it a miss!",4,9,14,13 November 2012
Spider-Man 2," Spiderman? More like Superman half the time..
","As sequels go this one isn't bad. It's entertaining, the characters get more development, the CGI is more intense, the perceived 'threat' is more deadly etc. etc.But somehow , despite a reasonable first half, I felt let down by the second half. The warning signs were there all along, thinking about it, but I ignored them because, up until the half-way mark, the film was pretty good and I was enjoying it. But once the movie crossed into the nonsense-filled second half, all those 'ignored sillinesses' of the first half flashed back to haunt me. As a result, the pleased expression on my face darkened into a scowl and the movie lost me by the three-quarter mark. I was just glad when it finished.Spiderman, the CGI creation doesn't look any more real than he did the first time out to me. Additionally, it grated on my nerves that he was apparently able to defy the gravitational constant and swing around the city like he had a jet-pack strapped to his arse. It was like Van Helsing all over again.And since when was Spiderman indestructible? Or able to stop buildings from falling? Maybe I missed those comics as a kid but I don't remember him having those kinds of powers. Agility, yes. Spiderlike wall-climbing ability, yes. Super strong webs, yes. Regeneration, yes. But not being immune to damage or able to resist tons of pressure.Then there's my perennial favourite gripe - physics. If you put a comic-book character into a supposedly 'real world' situation, then you better stick to physics at all times or your movie ends up looking dumb. My example here is dumping what amounted to a small star in the Hudson River. Not only do we not get the steam-flash explosion that would probably have been as devastating as the star going up itself, but we don't even get a hint of warm water. Not even a tiny hot-spring effect. Just the star and Doc Ock serenely sinking to the bottom of the river. Bah!Other items which surprised me were the face pulling exploits of Tobey Maguire when he was stuck on the front of the train. Talk about ugly! I haven't seen a face that contorted since the decompression effects in Total Recall! And they say he can't act!Speaking of faces. What's with Kirsten Dunst? Her face when acting out any kind of emotional scene (other than terror) was, as my partner put it, 'a face like a half-p***ed cat!' Not pretty!So, the movie loses it after the halfway mark. If you can put up with the nonsense then it's a pretty good film, livened up by Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi cameos and some nice gags and one-liners. But don't expect anything but silliness from the second half.",6,1,2,9 July 2004
Finding Nemo," Solid Disney fare that the adults won't mind seeing.
","Disney has been a very hit or miss affair recently. The appalling Jungle Book 2 is best forgotten, whilst such delights as Lilo and Stitch and The Emperor's New Groove are to be praised. Finding Nemo falls squarely in the thumbs up zone, so it would seem that the mouse-house is finding its feet again.FN is quite an eye-fest. The animation teams have captured the underwater world with astonishing realism, though the fish characters are, as might be expected, a little bit cartoony. On the whole, though, an amazing piece of technical work.The story is simple and there are plenty of action scenes and sight gags to keep the kids happy. At the same time there are enough adult gags thrown in to keep parents amused and entertained too. There's even a Star Trek reference in the form of the 'Nexus' (watch it and see!)If I only have one criticism to level at the movie it is this (spoiler!).....After having rescued Nemo, both father and son appear to completely forget about the fish in the dentist's tank and return to their own idyllic existence. There is a short final sequence showing the fish escaping from the tank by themselves, but you'd have thought that Nemo and Marlin would have wanted to at least try and help. A bit puzzling that one, and disappointing in a film that clearly espouses values such as loyalty and friendship. Perhaps I missed something, but that bit messed up an otherwise excellent film.All in all though, great fun for the kids and entertaining for adults too.",7,0,1,1 October 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How to fall asleep in 10 minutes...
","I'm not a big fan of chick-flicks, but since this was billed as a comedy I decided to watch. Big mistake. My concepts of comedy obviously differ from the scriptwriters by a big margin. If you like cringing in your seat at truly awful dialogue and scenes then I suppose it is funny. But I just found it boring and tedious.The basic premise that a person would go out with someone only to try and lose them in short order was highly obnoxious. (Yes I know, its a comedy, but I still found this objectionable in the extreme.)In the end, I only watched the first half. I couldn't stomach any more. It was just too stomach-churningly dire. Plus, the whole story would have been better and more believable with younger (i.e. teen) actors.I guess this is a 'you either love it or hate it' movie. No prizes for guessing which camp I'm in.",3,0,1,3 April 2003
Constantine," Constant...something or other.
","Although I have a confession to make - I actually found this movie passably entertaining - I have to say that it does have its faults.The first is Keanu Reeves. The character he plays here is almost a carbon copy of Neo from the Matrix - even Robot Chicken makes fun of his acting range. There's almost no differentiation in his acting between the two movies. Whilst this may work for some actors - Arnie, John Wayne etc. - here it only serves to make him him appear, much like the comic this movie is based on, as two-dimensional. If you had to look at a list of Hollywood actors and pick an action-hero from them, Keanu is surely not going to be your first choice. He's more like an accountant than a hero.Despite his miscasting, the movie, thanks mainly to the effects and pacing, moves along quite well. Also, supporting parts do a lot to make this movie more enjoyable than it should be, with Rachel Weisz, Peter Stormare and Djmon Honsou all giving far better showings than poor old Keanu.The story is forgettable religious clap-trap involving heaven and hell. Apparently Hollywood can only think of Christianity when it comes to good and evil. What that says about Hollywood I don't know, but it's a theme that constantly resurfaces time and again. Suffice to say, ignore acting, plot and dialogue and the movie is enjoyable. Think too hard about any of it and the irritation will creep in.Summary: Switch of thine brain and go forth and observe this film. Thy will be done (out of a few quid, anyway).",7,3,5,9 June 2005
Troy," If at first you don't succeed, Troy, Troy, again...
","It constantly amazes me how, despite the uncounted original works of fiction that have never seen conversion to celluloid, Hollywood continues its tedious remake schedule of old, already done-to-death films. Of course, Hollywood covers up this trend with the new buzz-word 're-imagining', to describe this remake trend. But a remake is still just  a remake, no matter how badly you muck about with the story and characters or how many CGI effects you can cram in.                                          
So it is with Troy. Though not an awful film by any means, it really doesn't stand out as anything memorable. In fact, it had the feel of one of those old Italian sword-and-sandals epics from yesteryear, just with better known actors.The film moves along at a good pace and there is plenty of action, but it's not really edge of the seat stuff. Most of the actors give OK performances but the only one who seemed to have any passion for the role was Eric Bana, as Hector. The others just seemed to plod along. Orlando Bloom didn't seem at all comfortable with his role, at least, not until he had a bow in his hands. Peter O'Toole gave one of his usual 'I might launch into a manic moment at any time' performances, though mercifully, he never does. And Brad Pitt.....Hmmm. Brad Pitt as Achilles, a legendary hero. Well, I have to admit that he certainly worked out a great deal and looked great. But he didn't seem to me to project the commanding power that the role required. Maybe if he'd been a few inches taller.....Overall there isn't much plot. The whole film is just an excuse for one battle scene after another. It's as if the writers decided that the audience knew the basic plot anyway, so they didn't need to do anything other than write 'insert battle scene here' at various points in the script. In fact, this is a rare occasion for me. I have to say that I felt the battles actually got in the way of any story there might have been quite badly. As a result the movie is essentially one long series of battles interspersed with idle chatter and thin attempts to develop the characters.Oh, and how Wolfgang and Co must have laughed at their little 'Achilles' Heel' joke at the end. That was one of the most awful contrived moments I've seen for a long time. Laugh it up Wolfgang....made your money back yet?All in all it entertains, though it is definitely NOT destined to be remembered alongside such old epics as Ben Hur or The Ten Commandments. Watch this movie for the battle scenes, which, whilst well done, are most definitely overhyped. Supposedly the most gory and realistic battle scenes committed to celluloid, they are, nonetheless, quite ordinary as far as I am concerned and could have benefited from some imaginative choreography.
Not bad, but not good either.",7,0,2,11 June 2004
L.A. Confidential," A cop drama that doesn't rely on car chases?!?!
","Yep, it's true. LAC is a good old fashioned cop drama/whodunnit with excellent performances from all the cast. It's difficult to imagine how such a great cast was assembled, but I'm glad they managed it. Though Crowe and Pearce were hardly superstars then, this film certainly did their respective careers no end of good.Things which make this a great cop film:1/ Eddie Murphy isn't in it. 2/ There's no stupid ass wisecracks. 3/ The acting is first rate from ALL the cast.4/ The plot is engaging. 5/ It HAS a plot!To say much about the movie would tend to give away too much of the plot, so suffice to say its worth watching if you want your brain cells stimulated a little. One or two plot elements are a bit obvious, but as with any good film, this becomes something you wait for eagerly to confirm your suspicions, not something you just shake your head at sadly.Although there are no car chases, there is a first rate shootout towards the end of the movie which alone is worth watching the movie for. Add in the plot and great cast and you have a fantastic movie, well deserving of its place in the IMDb top 50.",8,2,4,25 November 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Enjoyable enough, but don't look between the cracks or you'll see the sellotape holding it all together.
","As a self-avowed fan of apocalyptic scenarios either in book or film, I couldn't help but enjoy this movie, even though I felt more than a little let down by it.If you're looking for effects, then this film has plenty. But if you fancy a decent human interest story to go along with the destruction then I fear you'll be disappointed. The human side of the story is rather basic. A love interest angle for Sam Hall (Gyllenhall) and the obligatory struggle to survive. A father's love for his son and some hokum about a kid with cancer. Bland stuff.Whilst the effects are worth the money, the plot really isn't. As I mentioned before, I still enjoyed the film, but it was sadly lacking any real depth or characterisation. Additionally, rather obvious plot developments (at least I think so) were ignored in favour of cheap thrill alternatives. For instance, in a life or death struggle for survival I think rather more people would throw off the yoke of civilization and use the situation to their advantage. I'm not talking looters here, either. But in a group such as portrayed in the movie, it might have been nice to see one person with his own ideas (however dark) emerge - a human vs. human conflict. Instead, the only threat our group faces (apart from the weather) is from a pack of wolves that, having escaped from a zoo, apparently turn immediately into a pack of ravening man-eaters. Ho hum.Another nonsense concerns the girl who cuts her foot and gets an infection as a result. Not once during the steady onset of blood poisoning does she examine the cut or question why she doesn't feel too good. Duh!And whilst I'm ranting, how many people would actually follow a traffic cop out into the frozen, icy outdoors, wearing nothing more protective than their everyday casual attire, on the basis of the fact that he was an official and told them they had to 'head south'. Absolute bollocks! No-one is that dumb. Even children aren't that trusting.Another annoyance was the insistence of the director that there wouldn't be a Hollywood 'happy ending'. I'm not sure what I expected after I read this comment, but I doubt it was the evacuation of half of America to relative safety. That doesn't sound too apocalyptic to me. Nor did I expect to see the NY survivors thronging the rooftops of skyscrapers in their hundreds waiting for rescue by squadrons of helicopters who clearly had nothing better to do than fly around abandoned cities. How these people survived, when our heroic group only just managed it, is not explained.There was a lot (and I mean mounds!) of juvenile writing that went into this script and a lot of final-scenes feel-good nonsense. Too much 'man will prevail' rubbish from a director who promised us something better, then didn't deliver.There are some nice visuals and some good ideas for the use of them, but the story is rather lame and best ignored by the viewer. If you do that, then it'll entertain reasonably well. But if you start thinking about the plot.......ewww!I'll no doubt watch this again when it comes on TV but, having noticed the cracks, it's hard not to look into them and see the whole thing for what it really is - an excuse to use CGI a lot.",6,0,1,5 July 2004
Spider-Man 3," Spiderman, Spiderman....Does whatever a ........yeah.....whatever...
","And lo! On the third movie, the creators looked down and said....let there be CGI! And there was CGI. And the audience looked upon the CGI and saw that it was....meh....overdone.Yes, sad but true. Once again CGI has been taken to extremes and in places it looks real hokey. USed to be that fire and water were the two big non-no's for CGI. Well....you can add sand to that list now. Sandman, whilst making a valiant attempt, just looked like an effect every time he was on screen. As always, I maintain my belief that, if you can tell it's an effect without trying, it shouldn't be in the movie.That said, I was impressed with the Venom symbiote/suit. That was a well-done effect. Pat on the back for that one.But Sandman was woeful, just woeful.If it seems that I'm focusing mostly on the effects in this review it's for a good reason. There really isn't much substance to the film other than that. Sure, you get the inevitable internal turmoil with Parker/Spiderman and the inevitable relationship issues with Mary Jane. Add in a couple new villains and a dig up some old plot-line about Ben Parker's death and you'd think there'd be plenty to entertain. But in fact, on more than a few occasions you're left shuffling uncomfortably in your seat and wondering when things will get a move on.There are some good scenes in the film. The crane/destruction of an office thing was quite entertaining. And the fight at the end (minus the Sandman part) was reasonable. But on the whole the movie failed to entertain consistently.In fact, when the highlight of a movie is a cameo by Bruce Campbell (Love ya Brucey!) you know its a bad sign for the rest of the film.In summary then....some bad effects, too long, an occasional good scene and the feeling that you could have done something more productive with those two hours of your life.",5,2,2,7 July 2007
Silent Hill," Silent uphill-struggle...
","To stay awake mostly. Also to try and piece together the rather illogical plot and the idiotic character actions throughout the movie.Admittedly, I gave up after a while, just letting the visual 'goodness' wash over me. But there isn't much substance to Silent Hill. More like substance-abuse. Not since Event Horizon have I seen such relatively unnecessary levels of gore. And it's not as if it really adds anything to the movie other than to give it a distinctive visual style.Forget the 'plot' which, in the end, is a risibly simple witchcraft/vengeful spirit affair. Forget the characters, which quite frankly evoke no feelings of sympathy whatsoever from the viewer. Take away the graphics and the laughably (though unintentionally, I'm sure) monsters and there is little left other than the tale of a mother trying to help her daughter.And what a mother! Hmmm! My daughter's having nightmares, drawing strange pictures and sleepwalking. What to do? I know! I'll drive across country to the town she's drawing and then.....oh well, I'm sure I'll figure it out when I get there! Oh no! A cop is pulling me over for some reason. She'll no doubt know I'm a raving lunatic who shouldn't be in charge of a kid and try to stop me! What to do? I know! I'll drive away at high-speed and REALLY give her a reason to chase me and arrest me! Ha ha! I've lost her...oops! Lost control of the car too! Clunk! And it all kind of goes (Silent) Downhill from there. I'm sure fans of the game may have more insight into what the Hell was going on, but I didn't. Why did the mad guy have a weird triangular head? Why did he have a blade six feet long and two feet wide? Why this? Why that? Why bother? It's a mess really which I don't think even game-conversion king Uwe Boll could have made any worse. In fact, I suspect he'd have done at least a much more amusing version involving visibly blunt Dural swords and maybe a cameo by a has-been star for good measure. As it stands, not really worth getting excited about unless all you want is eye gore/candy.Silent Hill? Silent and Deadly.....deadly tedious, that is. Avoid it. It makes sniffing your own sweaty armpits a preferable experience.",5,2,4,6 June 2006
Fast & Furious 6," Fast and Dubious 6
","Yeah, well... what can I say. I enjoyed the last Fast movie even with the ridiculous safe towing chase scene. But this one.... not so much.It was still a fun ride, with all the characters doing their roles well, but I can't help think they tried too hard to top the last one. The focus was very much more on 'How ridiculous can we make it and not make people go Huh?' The answer, unfortunately, was that they overcooked it a little.The tank chase scene is enjoyable right up until the mid-air leap of faith that Dom performs with Letty. Then it was a 'Huh?' moment. Mainly a 'Huh, why aren't they both suffering shattered bones?' moment, in fact.Later on, they indulged themselves ever more. The runway sequence went on for far, far too long. I don't mean that it was boring, just that there isn't a paved runway that long anywhere in the damn world! The bad guy drives onto the runway and, thirteen minutes and five seconds later, the chase concludes on the same runway. I'm going to be generous and say they were going only about fifty mph (the drama suggests far faster speeds). That gives a runway length of ten point something miles. Edwards Airforce base's longest runway is seven and a half miles long and it isn't paved. So where this foolishness is supposed to take place I have no idea.I wouldn't mind, but the runway scene is blatantly overlong. Even knowing nothing about airports or the like, it leaves you wondering about it.Character-wise, I get that Dom loved Letty and thought she was dead, so he moved on with the Brazilian chick, Elena. But character-wise, is it so hard to think he might find it just a little bit more difficult to dump Elena in favour of Letty again when he finds out she's still alive? I'd have been happier if his character had stayed with Elena. Letty had lost her memory, so she had nothing more than vague feelings to go on to tell her that he was anything special to her. A perfect opportunity to have things work out without making it the usual saccharin-fest, everything works out in the end type of deal that Hollywood is so fond of.All this ending left me was feeling that Dom had shafted Elena (and not in the fun way, either!). No amount of 'She's okay with all this' convinced me otherwise. It all smacks of 'Let's get Michelle Rodriguez back in the franchise 'cos it needs a boost.' followed by 'Wait! What about that other chick Dom was going out with at the end of the last movie?' and then blank looks all around until 'We'll hand-wave their relationship away!' Still, I suppose it was better than 'Let's kill her off to clear the way for Dom to get Letty back!' All in all, though, a disappointment at several points. In between, it was fun and entertaining. However, it did leave a sense of dissatisfaction due to the nonsense scattered throughout.Here's hoping they don't try and top the action in this one next time around.It seems like even numbered Fast movies are not the best of the bunch.",6,1,3,22 July 2013
Final Destination 2," Far better than I had expected
","I didn't have great hopes for this film but I was mildly, and pleasantly surprised. I had expected the first movie, repeated. Admittedly, on the face of it, that is what you get. But FD2 takes things a step further by showing that the events of the second film take place because of the events of the first film. They are connected far more deeply than simply being 'another batch of people that escape death'.The effects are well done and striking, as in the first movie, this time focusing on a road accident rather than an air crash. And, of course, death's efforts to 'put things right' by offing those that escaped the road accident are the usual level of weird and seemingly impossible twists of chance that we grew used to in the first movie.Although I welcomed the plot development, linking this movie to the first one, the whole movie was never scary, as such. It's plenty gruesome enough (see the barbed wire scene, for example), but not very frightening. After some thought, I think this is in part due to the fact that I have recently been watching the series 'Dead Like Me'. Every time in the movie that things seemed to take on a life of their own, I was imagining Gravelings prodding and tinkering. It kind of ruined any suspense that might have been in the moment.However, the movie is a worthy sequel to the first. Not necessarily better, just worthy of the name. Again this is mostly due to the fact that it progressed the story a little, rather than simply cashing in on the first's success.If you liked the first movie, this one won't disappoint.",7,0,0,23 September 2003
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Good film, just a little bit...
","... samey. Not that it is anything like the first Cap'n America outing, but just that all these Marvel movies are starting to tread a very similar path.By that I mean the plot is entirely predictable and refuses to be anything other than that. There are no surprises here. Just a tried and tested formula that, whilst it works, leaves you ultimately feeling a little let down.It's kind of difficult to write this review, because although I enjoyed the movie, I also think it didn't live up to the hype. There is plenty of action and effects but little else.For example... The Cap is from the era of World War 2. All his friends and family are gone. Yet there wasn't much in this film to really make you feel for the guy's predicament. There are references and so on, but the script didn't really try that hard to make you feel sorry for the proverbial 'Man out of time'. It felt more of a 'Oh isn't this sad.... moving on...' kind of thing that doesn't really do him justice.Also, though it was obvious they'd bring him forward through time to the modern day setting, I can't help but miss the first movies' setting. Call me old-fashioned, but there is something comforting and right about seeing a superhero beat up Nazis that just isn't there with their modern day descendants in Hydra.That said, the story thread involving his supposedly dead buddy from the 'good old days' was a nice inclusion but, again, I don't think they really did it the justice it deserved. It was there, but it was almost like (as above) that they wanted to get the personal aspects of that out of the way as quickly as possible.One other thing I noticed... I know the Cap is superhuman because of the serum he was given, but it seems to me he's even more super in this outing than in the first one. He's not superman, of course. He can't fly but boy! Can he fall well! The thing I like most about Cap'n America was that he was the most normal seeming of the heroes. I hope they don't take that away from him in future.Finally, please, please stop shoehorning Stan Lee into every Marvel movie. It was nice to begin with but now it is just embarrassing. It's also incredibly immersion breaking. You know he's going to be there, somewhere, at some point in the film. Then, just as you begin to really get into things, up he pops! It's bloody annoying and it needs to stop. With Stan Lee it was just a passing shot to begin with. Now they're giving him lines, for God's sake! Just stop it! Anything that pulls you out of the fantasy world the movie creates is just wrong and the sooner Hollywood and its directors (sadly I'm looking at you all too often, Peter Jackson!) understand this, the better.There. I'm done.SUMMARY: Good action movie. Primarily Eye candy over substance but enjoyable anyway. Personal story threads feel rushed and an afterthought. A decent sequel, but a little over-hyped, as usual.",7,0,0,28 June 2014
Ocean's Thirteen," All at Sea.....
","Yikes....This was an exercise in endurance! This film reminded me again of how angry I am that evolution didn't provide me with a built-in sleep timer in my head. This is two hours of tedious consciousness I could have avoided otherwise! But here's the important parts broken down, and why they didn't work at all.Exposition. Endless chatter between the characters about what they are going to do. This important screen-time far outweighs the actual doing of the plan. I reckon by a factor of at least three times. It wouldn't be so bad, but with that much laying out of the story, you'd expect by the time they get on with the job that you'd have a really firm grasp of what was going on.....but in reality, there are still many 'huh?' moments that leave you playing catch-up with the events.Fun. There wasn't a whole lot of it in this film. Few witty one-liners, few visual gags, few comic situations at all. I think I chuckled a couple of times....no laughs, no guffaws, just a couple of snorts of pseudo-laughter.Action. Well, the CGI was minimal, thankfully, but so was the action. A bit of pretend elevator shaft acrobatics was all we got and that was as ridiculous as it was unconvincing. Other than that, the heady excitement of watching grown men discuss their cunning plans with one another. Ooooh, the thrill! Plausibility. Not very good. The stupidest part was the effort they went to in order to get loaded dice. Who would have believed the top casinos in the world got their dice from a tiny plastics firm from Craphole, Mexico? And as for using the Channel Tunnel excavators to cause earth tremors.....don't even get me started. This is mustachio-twirling villain territory!Actors. Well some of them at least tried to have fun. Matt Damon with his ludicrous fake nose, for instance. But for the most part, the feeling they all gave off was....'We have to do this, so let's just get on with it and get it over with as quickly as possible'. No real passion, not even much in the way of over-acting. Just formulaic stuff as dull as the movie.SUMMARY: 90 minutes of men chattering at one another and 20 minutes of pretend excitement. Do yourself a favor.....fast forward the first hour at least and some enjoyment might be derived from this dull film.",4,3,5,7 September 2007
Corpse Bride," It's different...
","Tim Burton has made a whole career out of doing out-of-the-ordinary films so it's no surprise that he extends this weirdness to animated features. Of course, we've already had Nightmare before Christmas and this is more of the same.That said, the distinctive animation style can only hold interest for a short while before you start looking for more substance, like a plot. Luckily, Corpse Bride has a plot - albeit a very simple one. Young man wants to marry young girl, but instead accidentally marries a dead girl. Actually it's more fun than I've made it sound.If the movie has a problem it's with the opening fifteen to twenty minutes. These set the scene but are rather humourless and dry. Fortunately, just as you're starting to wonder whether you've made a horrible mistake in sitting down to watch this movie, it takes off. The young man's descent into the 'underworld' and the ensuing hijinks, though not side-splittingly funny, certainly entertain with (mostly) sight gags and 'dead' humour. If you think along the lines of the undead visual gags from Pirates of the Caribbean you won't go far wrong in your expectations from Corpse Bride.I don't think it'll win any prizes, but it is fair entertainment and at about 1hr and 20 mins doesn't last TOO long - a fault of some films.Certainly worth a look.",7,0,0,20 January 2006
Predator," Ahh! The heyday of Arnie's movie career
","Yep, that's what it felt like when I recently re-watched this on DVD. Those were the days when you didn't need character development and meaningful looks into the camera. You didn't need flowery dialogue or unecessary story exposition. All you needed for a blockbuster was Arnie, and a load of big guns.I specifically use the term heyday, since it now appears that Big Arnie may well be winding down his film career in favour of a political one. Recent releases like T3 show he can still do the action, but he isn't getting any younger. I'd hate to still see him doing action when he is no longer capable of it. That would bring back too many memories of Chuck Norris........perish the thought!However, Predator was one of his early greats. No real plot, as such, just a bunch of soldiers with Arnie as their leader, facing off against an alien menace. In those days, you knew that Arnie would survive. Death was not a contract option for him. Spouting his corny (sometimes so corny that you couldn't do anything but cringe as he uttered them, though in a delighted, warm fuzzy feeling way, not a 'god that's awful' way) Arnie bulldozed his way through enemies, plot, dialogue coaches teaching et al as he made movie after movie with nothing more complicated at its heart than action, action and yet more action.Predator was also the first movie that I can remember that, in the tradition of having big guns in Arnie flicks, had a man-portable mini-gun in it. Even more astonishing, or perhaps purposefully done, is the fact that Arnie never uses it. Perhaps the implication behind this was that he doesn't NEED to. He's tough enough without it!All in all, Predator satisfies the action requirements of any Arnie film. There's not the humour of later films, or Commando, for that matter, but it is still one of his greats.",8,3,5,23 September 2003
The Bourne Identity," Simple plot, excellent realisation.
","This movie surprised me in two ways. Firstly, that the action sequences (on the whole) were realistic and not overdone. Secondly, that Matt Damon handled the role so very well. I had no trouble believing in his character.It follows a standard 'assassin loses his memory then tries to work out what is going on' plot, but trundles along quite nicely.My only gripe is with one of the final scenes in the film, where Damon's character is fighting off a group of killers sent to take care of him. SPOILER. In one scene he grabs a body and jumps over the side of some stairs, then falls about six or seven flights, landing on the body, using it to cushion his impact and then staggers away, unharmed. I'm not sure about that one.But the action works well enough (even that scene) due to Damon's absolute, no-nonsense approach to the scenes. There are no glib witticisms. No one-liners. Reminded me a little of action scenes involving Steven Seagal (who, let's face it, can't act, but knows how to fight).Anyway, worth a watch to see what combat sequences should really be like. But Die Another Day fans will be sadly disappointed.",7,0,1,29 December 2002
The Italian Job," Not brilliant, but not too shabby either
","It's not a movie you watch over and over again, but this 're-imagining' is not that bad. In fact, give it any other name and the only similarities between this movie and the Michael Caine version would be the presence of mini's. The story is pretty predictable and forgettable, but it is the characters that make the story watchable. Or at least, some of the characters.Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron, though OK, aren't the larger-than-life characters you'd expect from a film like this. Accordingly they pale next to the likes of Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def, all of whom seem to compete amongst themselves to see who can steal scenes off each other. Seth Green seems to win most of the time but Mos Def in particular was a pleasant surprise. I'm no great fan of musicians turning to acting, especially ones with weird names. But he gave a great performance and gives me hope for 'The Hitch-Hikers Guide...' out later this year.As mentioned, the plot is best forgotten in favour of watching the characters interact, which is where the film really scores.It's good enough that I'll watch the sequel when it arrives, but just for the characters, you understand. I'm sure the plot will be drivel.",6,3,5,27 March 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Absolutely fantastic.
","Most of what needs to be said about LOTR has already been said. It's a fine movie that pleased and delighted even the many nay-sayers who thought that Peter Jackson would produce  another movie like Braindead. Having now watched the extended version I have to say that it adds a few extra scenes without going too far and just rounds out the story a little more. There are still a couple of scenes I would have liked to have seen in the film, namely the Barrow-Wights and also the scene after they leave Moria where they look into the lake, but very little of any consequence is left out of the story.The cast are all excellent and very much as I imagined them when reading the books many years ago. It's also refreshing to see a movie where the film isn't carried by one or two main actors. All the cast get significant screen time, and the various sub-stories (Gimli and Moria or Boromir, for example) are well presented and not skimpy add-ons to the main plot.There are some liberties with the script and characterization. For example, Merry and Pippin are now much more along for comic-relief than the serious young hobbits they were in the book. But even this works, as it provides a source of light humour to an otherwise quite dark storyline.And to those that say it's nothing like the books, well..... just be thankful it didn't turn into Dungeons and Dragons, or you'd really have something to cry about.",10,1,1,30 December 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Here we go.......again! Yawn.
","Less than 6 months after the underwhelming Reloaded, here comes Revolutions. And it's similarly underwhelming. Not quite as much as Reloaded, because it did have its moments. But all in all, not as good a conclusion as I had hoped. In fact, I begin to fear it's not a conclusion at all, but just the beginning of a long running franchise, possibly doomed to the likes of mini-series and TV movies, with unknown actors replacing the real stars and the whole thing ending up in an unhealthy, Galactica 1980 kind of stupidity.That said, Revolutions is better than Reloaded. The dock combat sequence was very interesting, though the combat mechanoids are not a new idea by any stretch of the imagination. In fact the APU's are not even particularly well designed, from a combat point of view - those dangling ammunition belts are just woefully wrong and entirely out of place in anything except a Rambo film.The sentinels swirled around like a shoal of fish, which was a nice visual touch, but I couldn't for the life of me understand why, once that many of them (thousands) had gotten into Zion, they didn't simply swarm over the defenders like bees from all sides at once. Would have made for boring cinema, I guess, but not very realistic. There were also a number of scenes involving shoulder launched missiles that reminded me all too much of Starship Troopers. Also, didn't the sentinels throw bombs in the first movie? Why didn't they do that in Zion?At least Revolutions didn't have the sickly sweet, everything turns out fine for everyone, ending that Hollywood tiresomely trots out again and again. A main character dies! Love does not conquer all. Good doesn't triumph over evil without batting an eyelid. All good points in an otherwise lacklustre movie. Other good things include fewer endless martial arts scenes where the fight goes on, and on, and on, like everyone has Duracell's fitted.A lot of plot points, which fans hoped would be explained, were glossed over, ignored, or given stupid answers. For example, Neo's ability to use his powers outside of the Matrix we are told is 'because he is the One' and that's it. Pseudo-religious crap. And there's a limbo-like area between the Matrix and the Real World. More pseudo-religious crap. There are also several more 'psycho-babble' moments where exposition goes crazy and you end up gritting your teeth, hoping the film will actually continue before too much longer, so that you don't start to nod off. Another thing which bugged me - the ships have EMP devices, but Zion does not? The number one way of defeating sentinels and the Zionists (yet more pseudo-religion there) don't think its a good idea to run up a few score spares? Instead they resort to men in armoured suits and bullets. Hmmmm. This kind of 'let's write an exciting story, but not think what people would actually do in such a situation' writing is what really pi$$es me off with cinema today. Sure, the initial viewing may be favourable, because we can all overlook such things, but re-watch factor becomes less and less when we have our intelligence insulted by such awful plot failings.By the way, am I the only person who finds the Oracle to get increasingly irritating as the movies have progressed? So smug, so 'know-it-all'. Gah! Shame she doesn't get her program erased!On the bright side, my enjoyment of the film was boosted immensely by the appearance of Bruce Spence as the 'The Train Man'. Nice to see him on film again. A small role, but worth it.All in all another underwhelming movie that cannot live up to its hype, or the success of the original. Mostly down to the FX crews ever raising the bar of our visual expectations. The extraordinary is now ordinary and we demand something spectacular in order to be wowed. Revolutions has its moments, and is worth watching, but its nothing special anymore.The original will continue to have a place in my DVD collection, but I'll not be shelling out cash for the sequels. The Wachowski's may have come up with a great idea in 'The Matrix' but time has proven them unable to take the idea and run with it.",7,1,2,20 November 2003
Man of Steel," Best Superman film ever!
","Well, maybe not, but I did enjoy it quite a lot. I don't particularly like superhero movies. They never seem to get the balance between comic book slapstick and terrible seriousness right. They are either too far one way or the other.I did come here with the intention of nit-picking the plot holes in Man of Steel a bit but you know what, I'm not going to. Despite those things, the film just kept me smiling all the way through. Besides which, having seen some of the most ridiculous fanboy angst and gum-beating amid the other reviews here, I came to realise just how absurd it would be for me pull apart a story about a man who flies around in a cape! That said, I have a few niggles.Amy Adams. I'm never convinced by her in anything I see her in. I have no idea what sort of person she is in real life, but she always seems to me like she's just escaped from the 1950's. It's just her manner and projection, I think, but it always catches me unawares. It's a kind of uncanny valley moment whenever she's on screen. I don't think she made a particularly good Lois Lane.Also, though I enjoy violence and destruction as much as the next guy, there was a LOT of it in here, especially towards the end. I couldn't help wondering just how many thousands of innocent people were being killed by falling buildings and the like as Superman fought Zod. Still, I'm all for wanton destruction, so...Of course, now that this has been made, there will be the inevitable sequel. However, given the level of violence and threat that Zod brought to this movie, it is hard to see how, say, Lex Luthor is going to be more than a minor nuisance to Superman. Wait and see, I guess.SUMMARY: Good action movie. No real sense of threat towards Superman, but a ton of destruction and violence. A tad long in places, but not bad for a reboot.",7,3,5,24 October 2013
The Village," The Adventures of Super Blind Girl!
","Yeesh! What a dull and completely predictable movie this was! I'll admit, the opening fifteen minutes or so had promise, but it very quickly becomes apparent what is going on and what WILL happen at the end. The only real surprise moment was when the retard knifes the boyfriend of super blind girl. And, at that precise moment, any last vestiges of mystery evaporate like spilt petrol from a hot forecourt.In essence, The Village tries to be a clever movie that will 'shock' its audience with the revealed 'truths'. In reality, even Western Union would have trouble matching the telegraphing that goes on here! I mean, they don't just drop subtle clues, its bloody great sledgehammer-like obvious ones.In a nutshell, this is the story...A small community of (apparently) turn of the century/late 1800's folk live in mortal fear of 'Those we do not speak of' (tm) who live beyond the boundaries of their community. As a result, they never leave the community. The Elders tell everyone that the world outside is wicked. However, when someone is hurt, everything begins to 'unravel' and someone has to be sent for medical help.So here's the thing. Nobody leaves the community, but apparently everyone knows there is a town nearby. Despite the fear of 'Those we do not speak of' (tm) - of which they seem to do nothing but talk - it's difficult to imagine that someone wouldn't have tried by now and succeeded.Because of the aforementioned 'subtle' clues, it becomes apparent early on that the whole thing is a sham and that there are no real monsters. Likewise, it also is equally apparent that the 'wicked world' outside is actually the modern day world. However, fear not, for the real surprise is actually that the supposed retard is a lunatic prepared to commit murder.After about thirty minutes nothing really comes as much of a surprise anymore and you're left looking at your watch/DVD counter etc. and wondering how much longer it can be dragged out for. The answer is another hour, during which we are treated to the ridiculous concept of a blind girl being sent out to fetch medicines for her sick boyfriend whom the retard stabbed. Of course, she succeeds, along the way handily dispatching the retard to his doom at the bottom of a pit. The end.Things that insulted me about this movie: The blind girl who acted like she was not blind and could handily navigate through a forest she'd never been in before and then back again. Blind people are capable at getting around, but I doubt orienteering is high on their list of 'must do' activities. Gah!The conceit behind the victims who set up the community. How ironic, intentional or otherwise, that those who had been the victims of crime should choose to persecute their own children and force them to live away from modern society, medicines and services. To such an extreme that they would be willing to let people die rather than go the few miles to fetch help. Bah! M Night Shyamalan.... it's becoming rapidly apparent to me that Mr Night wants us to think he's a cool, cutting-edge kind of director. A Spielberg or Cameron, or even a Burton. The reality is, he's mediocre at best and good upon occasion. The top-notch director class that he wants us to think he belongs in is as believable as most of his movies. In other words, a complete fantasy, a conceit of his own mind. He can make some effective films, but frequently ignores that which makes a movie entertaining in favour of 'clever' plot twists which the audience has foreseen long before. As a result, his movies are never shocking or surprising, just formulaic and dull.Summary: This would make a good episode of the Outer Limits or Twilight Zone, but instead is drawn out into a movie that should never have been.EDIT: It was gratifying to see Robot Chicken mock Mr. Shyamalan. Thanks Seth Green!",5,2,5,5 December 2005
The Revenant," A tale of revenge... done boringly.
","I left off reviewing this movie for some time. I wanted to mull over what I had seen and come to an understanding of what it was that bothered me about the film.See, I liked the movie as I watched it. At least, for the first thirty minutes or so. However, once the revenge trail was well and truly set out upon, things started to go downhill.At the end of that viewing, I was left in two minds as to how I felt about the movie and that was why I decide to wait until I had time to think things through before commenting on it.Now that I've had that time, here are my thoughts: Firstly, everything about the movie screams quality. Quality acting, quality cinematography, quality effects and so on. If I had to make a film, I'd hire everyone involved in this one... with one exception.The writer. Hugh Glass' tale is one of revenge, albeit heavily altered from the facts of the real Mr. Glass' exploits. So why then, did the writers see the need to push the survival element so hard? Sure, the tale of survival is astounding, but the heart of the movie is about revenge. That is what drives Glass on in the movie to overcome all obstacles placed in his way. Yet that revenge plays second fiddle to the 'man vs. the elements' story that appears here.What this means to the story is that there are altogether too many scenes of narrow escapes and ridiculous survivability going on. In fact, the movie is 90% this and little more.What's that? The real Glass survived similar travails? Well, yes he did, in so much as no one story about him agrees on much of anything. Yet this isn't a factual account. It is cinema, and in cinema, we expect to be entertained. Incredible escapes are one thing, but when they verge into the ridiculous, they have gone too far.Bear mauling...fine. Trek through hundreds of miles of frozen wilderness... fine. Wading and swimming through icy rivers in the winter and not getting hypothermia... wait, what? Riding a horse off a cliff and surviving the eighty foot drop with no broken bones... hang on a minute. Happening on a friendly native to help him... right. Rescuing a native woman from the French... huh? It goes on and on. The more you ponder it, the more ludicrous the whole thing becomes. Glass in this film isn't just a tough survivor, he's indestructible. He makes John McClane look like a pansy.Now, don't get me wrong, everything is done well enough to make you buy the tale at first glance. But it doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Everything is contrived. Actual survival elements are ignored when they aren't convenient to the plot, such as the lack of hypothermia. In other words, the more you think about it, the less coherent it is.I don't think I'll watch The Revenant a second time. It isn't that kind of film. Unfortunately, it doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be either. It's one of those films you will watch and then forget within months. And when you catch it on regular TV in a few years time, you'll frown, then recognise it, make that 'Oh this thing!' face, and promptly change the channel.A lot of praise has been heaped on it for its technical merits, and rightly so. But story-wise, it is a mess. And, ultimately, shouldn't we be watching movies for the story, not how well they are made? SUMMARY: Cinematic equivalent of 'Don't judge a book by its cover' Looks fantastic, but ultimately fails due to excess in the story department - and not in a good way. Too much contrivance and coincidence. Plays the 'Look at me!' card too often. A tale of revenge lost in the survival motif. Not as good as it thinks it is.",6,4,7,8 February 2016
Pitch Black," It makes a change to see a film where you really don't know who will survive.
","This is a very underrated movie and worth a look even if your not a fan of the genre.The plot is rather similar to Aliens, and like that movie the cast are apparently stuck on the planet with the aliens. However, these aliens only come out in darkness and darkness on this world lasts for many years! Despite the plot plagiarism, this movie still stands up on its own. The aliens are different enough to be interesting and the characters are not just 'bug-fodder' like the marines in Aliens. There is a plot hole concerning the ecosystem in which the aliens exist and what they survive on between the periods of darkness, and what they eat when they haven't got nice juicy humans to snack on, but one can simply say 'each other' and be reasonably satisfied with the answer. The film is so good that this minor hole is easily ignored.The cast are all excellent, especially Keith David as the obligatory holy man who puts his faith in God to deliver him. Radha Mitchell is also good as a kind of wannabee Ellen Ripley figure. But its Vin Diesel that steals the movie and rightly so. He has as much charisma as all the others put together and the rest are all pretty good, so that's saying something. This film gave Diesel the status and stardom he now enjoys today, but I still have to say that this is the best of all his films to date.A great film to watch and for once it makes a change to see an action film where you really aren't sure who is going to survive or not.",10,0,0,17 December 2002
The Hills Have Eyes," Over the Hills and Far Away........as far as you can get!
","Yeesh! Where do I start with this one? I suppose I should point out that, apparently, horror means gore in modern movies. If so, then Hills is a 'real' horror movie alright. There's gore by the bucketloads. In fact, there is so much of it that it rapidly becomes meaningless as a means to shock the viewer.In fact, let's be honest, the sorts of people that like these kind of movies like them for precisely that....the gore factor. Horror does not enter into it.So how does this movie stack up in terms of entertainment value, let alone horror? Well...not good. Although I do recall watching the original many years ago, about all I remember is the basic plot. And this remake seems to me to follow that pretty soundly. So, an actual remake, rather than a reimagining. And thats probably why it doesn't work so well. If they'd put a little more thought into the story rather than writing scenes as feeble excuses to depict senseless violence and gore then the film might have had more value.As it is, however, they didn't and the film, as a result, is extremely predictable and formulaic. The 'good guys' are a somewhat dysfunctional extended family that learns to work together....eventually. Throughout most of the film, though, they all do their own thing and perform such retarded actions that its impossible to feel much sympathy for any of them, let alone root for them. In fact the only characters that you have any kind of feeling for are the dogs and the infant baby. None of the others seem worth a damn.So, having established the inherently unlikeable family it actually becomes quite pleasant watching them slowly get picked off for their idiocy. I know its a staple of horror movies that characters do stupid things, but here its just ridiculously overdone. Any family that dense deserves whatever it gets, quite frankly.Another thing, horror movies shouldn't make you snort with laughter or derision during them. Hills does that more than a few times. I think its mostly the absurdity of what went was happening on screen more than anything really funny that caused it. But whatever it was, I chuckled several times.Is it intelligent cinema.......hell no! Would I recommend it to horror fans.........no.Would I recommend it to gore fans.....yes.But I'd qualify the last by referring to the first comment above. Don't expect anything remotely like smarts to be shown by any of the characters.Summary: Gore factor: 8/10 Plot: 2/10 Snore factor: 8/10",5,1,2,14 November 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," He'll be back......
","Well, I liked this movie. Granted it was very similar to number 2, even had similar scenes in it, but at least it was harmless fun. And, of course, it had big Arn in it. The supporting stars were OK too, not brilliant, but not dire.If you liked the second of the series, then this one will not disappoint you (unless you were angling for something different). Some of it is a little trite and, needless to say, it is almost entirely predictable, right down to the final scenes. But its Arnie, doing what Arnie does best.....breaking things.There are some nice views of the prototype hunter-killers that characterised the flashbacks in the second movie. But I swear one of the T1's shrugged after looking down a corridor for the intruders (Arnie and Co). Might have been my imagination, though.Anyway, good fun, but nothing new. Now all we have to do is wait for the fourth installment - yep, it ain't over with this one!",8,0,0,11 July 2003
"I, Robot"," One of the better films of the year so far.
","Yes, it's true. I liked it. On the surface it's a simple future-cop story with lots of pretty graphics and an amiable star. But it did something (albeit for only a short time) that most films this year haven't. It made me think. Of course, once you figure out whodunnit, it's mostly just an action ride to the finish. But at least it tried.Most surprising of all here is Will Smith. He doesn't get to 'Will Smith-ify' the movie too much. In fact, he's very restrained and, it has to be said, very mature in this role. Only a couple of times does he get to cut loose, but on the whole I'm beginning to believe there is a serious actor hidden away inside him.The film as a whole doesn't take itself too seriously, even though the subject matter merits further thought. Likewise the graphics are pretty good (and this is one of the few movies this year that I've said that about) and work much better than I had feared.There are a couple of moments that made me frown, most notably the spinning car-in-tunnel scene. But on the whole nothing made me scowl at the screen.I've not read the book by Asimov, so I can't comment on how faithful the movie version is to the book. But, much like Starship Troopers, that matters less if the film is good and entertains you. And I, Robot entertains very nicely.Worth a look.",8,1,3,16 August 2004
Wanted," Un-wanted
","Here's a cool film that sadly won't make it into my DVD collection when it gets released. Why? Well, because I already have it! Admittedly, my version has a different name, different actors and, despite being even more fantastical than this one, is far less insulting to my intelligence. What is this DVD? I hear you cry. Well, it's The Matrix.To say Wanted borrows a few elements from The Matrix would be like saying that the white settlers 'borrowed' some land from the Native Americans. The characters, situations and effects are all there with only the thinnest of disguises (i.e. name changes and rationale) to distinguish them.And let's think about the rationale....Adrenaline, in sufficiently large doses, can make you perform superhuman feats like leaping between tall buildings in a single bound and, with minimal additional training ( er...beating) you can make bullets curl around things! McAvoy's terrible attempt at an American accent, Jolie's innate....rubberiness....and a hundred and one other annoying things all grate on your nerves after a surprisingly short while. Add in the ridiculous over-the-top action sequences and physics? What physics? mentality and the whole thing just begins to stink like a week-old kipper.Target audience? I'm really at a loss to think who might find this entertaining for more than a few seconds. So I'll be kind and suggest that only those desperate to plumb the depths of movie hell watch this. For everyone else, dig out your Matrix copy. It's less unbelievable.",4,11,27,26 June 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," All in all a worthy sequel to the original and another classic Cameron action movie.
","Arnold Schwarzenegger, James Cameron. Two ingredients that go to make a hell of an action picture. Cameron always seems to get that little bit extra out of an action sequence, something that's a bit different from all the rest. And Arnie...what needs to be said about him. He gets to use a mini-gun again, just like in Predator, but with far more effect.People have pointed out the 'inconsistencies' in the plot, but that's just part-and-parcel of time-travel pictures. By it's very nature it's a paradox. So you have to give it a little leeway in the consistency department.Robert Patrick is suitably emotionless as the killer android, but I couldn't help thinking the fight sequences between him and Arnie looked a bit weird - Arnie is seriously larger than Patrick. But only a little bit. They carried it off well enough, though.Another minor niggle (now I've watched the film several times) is to do with continuity and editing. And that's the door to the SWAT van. As it's being chased along the street by the T-1000 (Patrick) in a helicopter, he fires at the van with an automatic weapon. We then see the door, with Linda Hamilton hiding behind it, firing back at the helicopter. The door has three big holes near the window. There's another exchange of gunfire, and cuts between the chopper and van, and the next time we see the door, it has loads of holes in it, but the three big holes have disappeared. Another exchange of fire/cuts and the van door is back to the three big holes only, again. It's a minor glitch, but it niggles every time I see it and ruins the scene for me now.That aside, the picture has everything you'd want out of an Arnie action flick. Gunfights, explosions, Arnie one-liners, the works.If you have a chance to see the extended edition it's worth it. Like with the Aliens special edition, it adds enough extra bits to make the movie more entertaining and worthwhile, but doesn't throw in anything that changes the plot much. There's a dream scene involving Michael Biehn (Reece from the original film) which is a nice addition, and some extra footage in the foundry at the end which better shows the problems the T-1000 had after being frozen.All in all a worthy sequel to the original and another classic Cameron action movie.",10,3,3,19 December 2002
Disturbia," A remake (sorta) of the old Hitchcock classic
","There's nothing great to write home about with this movie. It delivers the shocks and comedy in almost equal amounts. That said it isn't terrible at being an entertaining film. But, with the inevitable comparisons to the aforementioned classic movie, it was never going to fare that well.I suppose the best thing that can be said about the movie is that they at least had the decency to not call it by the same name as the Hitchcock thriller, even though its obvious where its origins lie.The cast all give reasonable performances but I'm beginning to suspect Shia LaBouef is the new Hollywood poster boy....how many movies has he made this year alone? And as for poor old David Morse, I suspect he may get typecast as 'creepy old guy' before much longer.Anyhow, the plot is highly predictable - teen believes murder is his next door neighbour...nobody believes teen etc. etc. It was a nice touch to give a nod to the original by having LaBouef's character confined to his house by virtue of his leg. In this movie, unlike Rear Window, not a broken leg, but an ankle-tag that can't go beyond a certain point without triggering the alarm.It's not the worst film I've seen this year by far. But not overly memorable.",6,1,3,27 October 2007
The Patriot," Another movie that surprised me....
","And in a good way, too. Given the title and subject material, I had expected to be deluged with 'Isn't America a wonderful nation' type of dialogue and endless exposition of how freedom is to be valued etc. Whilst there is a certain amount of this, it was nowhere near as bad as I had feared an, as a result, I found myself enjoying the film for what it was - one man's struggle with his own demons and morals - and not yawning my way through the propaganda.Gibson gives a solid performance as the aforementioned haunted individual, reluctant to take up arms against the British as he knows what horrors war will bring.The British are portrayed variously as strutting fools or vicious, callous murderers. Jason Isaacs in particular is excellent as the commander who will stop at nothing to get the job done - in this case, crushing the American rebels. As a Brit, I suppose I should be more upset at the portrayal of my countrymen, but I know well what a dark time our colonial past was, so it didn't actually bother me. I actually found the characterisations rather humorous, which was perhaps unintentional. However, the characters are far too one-dimensional to take much exception to.There are some interesting battle scenes and some eye-openers too. For instance, the thought that warfare was once conducted by lines of men standing facing each other and shooting until one side was completely wiped out or ran away made me smile in disbelief at the foolishness of it all. The fact that it is also true is the most shocking thing. Now, of course, we can obliterate an enemy without ever having to look in his eyes, so you tell me which is the most insane.The story did seem to drag slightly in places, but not overly much, and the plot threads are very predictable. You know who will end up with who and who will die, who will win over the friendship of who, despite mistrust etc. But this does not harm the story in any real way.Overall one of those movies that will probably end up being shown on TV at holiday times. Worth a look.",7,4,8,24 September 2003
Van Helsing," Van Helstink
","Let me start this review by saying that I was predisposed to like this movie right from the start. I like horror movies and the meeting of three great movie legends - Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein's Monster - seemed to me to be an interesting and entertaining combination. Plus, the movie was by Stephen Sommers, director of The Mummy, which is one of my favourites. Then there was the cast - Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale and David Wenham. All these factors combined to bring a great sense of anticipation in me that this would be a great movie.Sadly, I was disappointed.It's not bad, by any means, but the things which make a movie great just aren't there. In trying to understand why this film didn't do anything for me, I can point to several factors, one of which, ironically, is one of the reasons I thought I would enjoy the film - the meeting of three screen legends. But let's go through it point by point.Firstly there's Richard Roxborough. Now, he looks like a good Dracula, I'll give him that, but unfortunately, from the moment he opened his mouth to deliver his characters first line, I found myself struggling not to laugh. His accent isn't terrible, but it's just the wrong side of a Realistic/Carry On movie accent to be anything but humorous. Any menace his character had was ruined by that.Secondly, there's altogether too much swinging from ropes, cables and chains in this film. It's entirely pointless, for the most part, and speaks of a lack of imagination when writing the scenes. The opening scene at Notre Dame cathedral, for instance, involves a scene with ropes. There's countless others throughout the film until you're left with the feeling that you're watching a Tarzan movie.Thirdly, and perhaps the most annoying. The CGI. It's just plain cack. None of the creatures look particularly realistic, in fact, they look like exactly what they are....CGI. Now, you'd think that a director whose movie The Mummy Returns was so slammed for the awful CGI Scorpion King at the end would have learnt from that mistake, but apparently not. Don't get me wrong, the CGI in VH is not anywhere near as bad as in TMR. But at no point in any of the scenes involving living (or unliving) entities do you not know that they are CGI. Although not awful, at some points it does begin to make you sigh sadly. Likewise the cuts between real actors and CGI are not done as well as might be expected. And what was the deal with the CGI Dracula? Talk about overweight! That just looked ridiculous.Fourthly, the combo of all the legendary monsters. I had thought this would be a good thing, but in fact none of the creatures got the development they deserved, instead being relegated to 'also-ran' status. I think if they had picked one monster and written a story around that - a la The Mummy - it would have made a better film, and provided for sequels. As it is, Stephen Sommers has shot his load by using all three staples (and never mind Dr Jekyll at the start!) and hasn't anywhere to go after this. At least, nowhere that makes any sense, anyhow.Finally, the physics. No, I'm not going to go all 'undead-can't-exist-because...' on ya. It's just that a lot of the CGI scenes involving falling, or swinging from ropes just don't look right. The eye perceives something that doesn't gel with your experiences of reality. And, as a result, the whole scene is ruined. It seemed to me that most of the swinging arcs in the film were actually parabolas, not arcs. In fact, the whole film has a 'watching someone else play a video game' feel.There are some bright moments to the movie, though. Well...OK. One. David Wenham gives a truly hilarious performance as Van Helsing's side-kick. Along with Kevin O'Connors Igor, these two improve the film no end. I've noticed this before in some movies - when you care about minor characters more than the main ones - it's usually an indication that the film isn't that good.In summary then, the movie fails to deliver it's promise, though I doubt that'll stop it from becoming a hit this summer. At no point do you really feel either frightened or amazed. Nor does it really make you care about any of the characters. At no point do you feel that VH will fail in his mission to destroy the Count. In short, there are no surprises, except the execrable CGI.In other words, another movie that has failed to live up to the hype surrounding it, much like Kill Bill 2, although not that awful. I can only hope The Day After Tomorrow and Troy don't go the same way. Watch it once, then forget it.",7,0,1,16 May 2004
Divergent," Horribly derivative and just plain daft!
","So, it seems these days that the word 'dystopia' has come to mean 'any old nonsense society we can think of regardless of how impractical or unbelievable it is.' Snowpiercer, The Hunger Games, Total Recall (the remake) and so on, all share this common belief that any crazy society makes a viable setting just so long as you can gloss over the many, many cracks that even a moment's examination will discover.Divergent is just a variation of The Hunger Games, when it boils down to it, with teens being forced to do dumb things for the sake of the society. There are five factions, but the only one that would probably be of any interest to, you know, an actual teenager, is the slightly demented Dauntless clan. They run, they leap, they do dumb things, and all just because they can. They are essentially painted as the 'fun' faction and it is hard to imagine, given their rivals, that any teen would pick anything else at choosing time.Hmmm. Let's see... Farmer, Doctor, Lawyer, or Dogsbody. Or I could be a leaping, fun-getting Dauntless! Such a choice...There is also the nonsensical 'test' that all teens must take, but the results of which are generally pointless, since the teen can pick any faction at the time of choosing. Yet everyone gets all worked up about the test anyway, like it actual has a point.All of the usual teen concerns are on offer here, but it is hard to take any of it even remotely seriously. It's just so ham-fisted in its delivery of all these teen issues that it invites derision for the most part.Acting-wise, all is fair, though no one shines. Almost all of the population appear to be teens, though, with a handful of adults around to spoil the fun and almost no small children at all, which seemed odd.The main heroine goes through the motions of trying to fit in and failing, all the while falling hopelessly in love with her much older instructor. One begins to wonder if the writer had a crush on one of her teachers that went unfulfilled in her youth.All in all, an overlong exercise in endurance with a daft societal premise that just plain sets itself up for ridicule.SUMMARY: Too long, Too derivative. Only worth it if you are a teenage girl who doesn't get out much.",6,1,1,14 August 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Shameless 'True Grit' style plagiarism, but is it any good?
","I admit, I watched this Americanised remake before watching the original and found it fairly entertaining. It seemed like a good, solid piece of entertainment, sufficiently dark to match Fincher's directing temperament. On its own merits, I might have given it an 8 for effort.But oh dear! Having watched it, I wanted to know more about the characters and the sequels. Given that there are no American sequels, I was faced with the choice of watching the Swedish original movies, or reading the books. I opted for the movies, and that is where the trouble began.You see, as I sat through the original, it became painfully obvious the American version is little more than a scene-by-scene copy of that original screenplay. Different actors, same scenes, same dialogue etc. But still, I liked this version, because it was reasonably well acted and shot.But oh dear! About halfway through I noticed something in the original that this version lacks utterly. Character development and background.This new version gives absolutely no background for either the Lisbeth Salander or Blomqvist characters. If they had simply changed the backgrounds it wouldn't be so bad. But whereas the Swedish version explains Blomqvist's personal interest in the missing girl, and explains why Salander is a ward of court, the Hollywood version excises all of that material.The resultant movie, in light of the original, is shallow and trivial. It's dark, yes, but not excessively so. Putting Fincher's name on this gives it a certain gravitas, but it is just a copy with all of the important parts cut out.Additions, such as a cat-friend for Blomqvist (yes, really!) and the utter insanity of Salander asking Blomqvist for permission to kill the murderer towards the end show how utterly clueless this screenplay was in capturing the essence of the work and the characters.I can't for the life of me understand the perceived need by Hollywood to 'do their own take' on foreign films. At best it just appears as awful plagiarism of what are, usually, better movies (Let the Right One In, anybody?). At worst they end up completely butchering the intent of the original.And for what purpose? How is a Hollywood version with a known actor and director any better than the original? Does reading subtitles really offend American audiences so much? Or watching the (rather well-done) dubbed version equally unpalatable? Or is it just that Hollywood believes it can do it better, because it is, after all, Hollywood? I don't know the answers. What I do know, however, is that this film, although watchable, is NOT better than the original. It's lazy film-making. Hollywood's 'Be Kind, Rewind' mentality of remaking foreign films should stop at once, or we shouldn't pander to them by watching what are, almost always, as here, inferior copies.",6,5,10,4 March 2012
Spider-Man," Not as good as it was spun up to be.
","I was rather disappointed by this movie. Once again I think the hype surrounding it raised my expectations too high and led to an inevitable anti-climax when I saw it.Don't get me wrong, it's a very watchable movie. Plenty of action and effects and with passable enough acting. Just not as good as it was spun up to be (sorry about the pun!)Nice to see Sam Raimi's trademark of action-comedy being continued rather nicely here, though. And it's always cool to see Bruce Campbell getting his usual cameo roles.I only hope that Spiderman 2 will not become just a simple action-fest devoid of plot.",7,1,2,20 January 2003
Jarhead," Empty vessel is right......
","A Jarhead, we are told during this film, is the 'nickname' for a US Marine and the implication is that he is an empty vessel. So it is with a certain amount of amusement that the term Jarhead also fits this movie very nicely.It is empty. Devoid of interest. Actually, the early part of the movie isn't too bad. But once the film moves beyond the Marine's training and heads out to the desert, you should consider heading out of the theatre. Nothing remotely interesting happens. Instead we are treated to what I assume is meant to be a shocking indictment of war, the men that fight it and the futility of it.The movie does sum up one thing rather well, however. I heard a comment some time ago, about how war is '99% boredom followed by 1% of panic-ridden terror'. This movie takes that comment to the extreme by providing a few minutes of interest in an otherwise dull two hours running time.Summary: It's a war-movie and not that good. Characters appear one-dimensional and the story is flat and uninteresting. With the exception of Wind-Talkers its far and away the most boring war film I've watched in the past few years.",5,0,1,12 January 2006
Dunkirk," Underdone-kirk
","Dunkirk is a movie that will not be for all tastes. Certainly I found it a bit of a slog at times and, having grown up with a diet of almost constant war movies, I found it lacking in a number of departments.Firstly, though, what Dunkirk gets right. The visuals are well-done and the acting very decent from all concerned. There is no fault that you can point at in regards to cinematography or on-screen realism. Everything has been carefully shot to enhance the feeling of being there, at Dunkirk, during the evacuation.Sadly, however, that is where the film's greatest strengths lie... in its mechanical execution of the film-maker's craft.So what did I find wrong with this movie? Well, it has little in the way of heart and soul. For a film about one of the most memorable moments in World War 2, this lack of emotional core leaves you rather nonplussed. I have seen any number of docu-dramas of wartime events that had more life in them than Nolan's effort.It was so marked, that I suspect that is what Nolan was aiming for all along. Namely, he removed the emotion from the movie in the hope that the events would carry more weight with the viewer.If that was the case, then at least for me, he failed. For the most part, Dunkirk plods along with at first a rather boring and slow tempo, and then with a more urgent, but somehow equally dull, pace. At no time did I feel any kind of excitement or concern for any of the characters.In part this is because there is almost zero character development. There is also little dialogue which leaves the viewer scrabbling for visual clues as to the characters motives and goals. You don't ever end up rooting for any of the people you see on screen. If they live, or die, it doesn't matter.That, then, is Dunkirk's biggest failing. It has no soul. A moment in history where ordinary people stood up and 'did their part' for the war effort is reduced to a dull, emotionless study of the event itself. For all the humanity on display, it might as well have been made by an alien with no understanding of our species.In addition to this soul-less aspect, the scale of the movie is also rather limited. Perhaps this was due to budgetary constraints, but you never see more than a couple of aircraft at once. There is no artillery shelling of the beaches. Although there is some strafing of the beach, it is only by one plane at a time. You rarely see many of the little ships and, at the end, when one of the survivors reads a paper that reveals over 300,000 have been evacuated, you are left thinking 'How?' At no point do you get the feeling this was possible given what you see on screen.All in all, a rather disappointing movie that lacks any real emotional connection for the viewer to latch on to. Considering how loudly, and greatly, this movie has been praised, I expected more from it than it delivered.SUMMARY: Emotionless and rather dull. No character development, little dialogue and little real sense of danger. Nolan should stick to sci-fi.",6,2,2,8 December 2017
Batman Begins," Like a breath of fresh-air.......
","Batman Begins is that Batman movie that we've all been waiting for, but believed impossible due to its ridiculous predecessors. Though, to be fair, the camp-factor was always present in the franchise, right from the days of the serial. Only the first movie attempted to be something different, but that was quickly drowned beneath awful camped-up scripts and dreadful over-acting, along with actors who really should have known better than to take part in the ongoing farce that was the franchise.So we come to the latest (and, in my humble opinion, by far the best) movie to date.Batman Begins is so different from its predecessors as to be almost a completely different story. Oh sure, we have Batman, Alfred, all the gadgets etc. but the way the story unfolds is just a treat. Everything is explained nicely. Gone are the childishly simple 'Bruce Wayne is rich, so that's how he gets all his gadgets' ploys and we get an in-depth look into the back history of Bruce, how he gets his fighting skills, where the gadgets originate from, and much, much more. In short, from being a one-dimensional superhero, Nolan has given us a character that we can relate to, understand, and in some senses, pity.But Nolan didn't stop with the character humanizing. Gone also are the equally one-dimensional bad-guys. Now they too have reasons for what they do. No more Danny de Vito in an 'even-fatter' suit making awful quacking noises. They even have a little bit of menace about them, rather than being parodies with all the fright-factor of Ronald McDonald.And there's more. Gotham is no longer the Victorian-architectural nightmare of the previous movies. Nolan has taken the 'Goth' out of 'Gotham'. Now it is a modern (and far more believable) city, with only a few tiny 'goth' bits here and there, like the overhead monorail. A vast improvement over the unrelateable pseudo-1800's structures of past efforts.And the story.....yes! There is one! Mostly it deals with Bruce's transformation into Batman, but it is nice to see it done so well. The movie never feels rushed. You never think 'Wait...how did he go from that, to that?' All is paced very well.That's not to say there aren't minor niggles. But they are minor. The violence is still very cartoon-like. Few badguy henchmen ever seem to be killed, just knocked-out. And there are some schlocky camp moments here and there (the 'Bat back-up' scene for example). But on the whole the movie satisfies in a way that none of the previous materiel ever has.The casting choices also seem spot-on. Everyone gives a sound performance and Bale is clearly the perfect choice for the Caped Crusader. He has that brooding presence that none of the others really had. Gary Oldman as the cop was also a pleasant surprise. His performance here as an out-of-his-depth-but-getting-on-with-it policeman was a far cry from some of his campier, overacting roles. Very subtle indeed.In summary, Batman Begins is that rare commodity, an Nth sequel that surpasses all its predecessors, and by a long margin. This is Batman for adults. It's dark, it's gritty and far more believable (A term I wouldn't normally use in reviewing a superhero movie) and it deserves to do very well indeed.If nothing else, it has certainly revived the franchise from the near-death coma it was in and sent it skipping and dancing through the Hollywood emergency ward. A sequel to this sequel is an inevitability at this point. And that is one movie I WILL look forward to watching when it arrives.",8,0,1,28 September 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A good movie with a bit of a mixed bag of good and bad things.
","The Hobbit is actually quite hard to review. With the hype (and outrage) surrounding the 48fps HFR filming, it was always going to polarise opinions. For my viewing, I chose the trusted 24fps 2D viewing, and my review reflects this version alone.On the whole, the Hobbit is a well-made epic that is worthy of praise. I do have some gripes about it, but they are relatively minor ones.The major one is this: Although the book was written for children it seemed as if Jackson couldn't decided quite how to pitch the movie and to what audience. There are elements of buffoonery the like of which you will not see outside of the Three Stooges at times, whilst at other moments, the movie veers firmly back to a more Lord of the Rings mood, complete with seriousness and much glowering from the actors involved.It's almost as if it is trying to be all things to all viewers, but is firmly unaware that, whilst catering to one section of the perceived audience, it is unintentionally irritating the rest.The dwarfs start out as dour and somewhat comedic characters in the opening scenes, but they do grow on you. That said, some of them are little more than cardboard cutouts, given an amusing hairstyle to make them stand out from the others. With thirteen of them, this is only to be expected, even in a movie as long as the Hobbit is. Character development may come in the later films, but as far as Ori, Dori, Nori Oin and Gloin are concerned, I couldn't pick them out in a line up.Another minor annoyance was the presence of Sylvester McCoy as Radagast. To be fair, he gives a reasonable performance, but the character is so ridiculous as to be innately unlikeable. As for the sled pulled by rabbits... well, let's just say that was a mistake and leave it at that.However, other than these things I did, in fact, quite enjoy the movie. There were a number of moments where scenes really did drag on too long and where I found myself hoping things would move on soon. Given that this is the theatrical release, I expect we will see an extended DVD/Bluray release at some point with some scenes extended even further.For contrast, after watching this, I watched the original Rankin Bass cartoon version from the 70's. That tells the whole story of the book in 1hr and 17 mins., with the material contained within Jackson's version finishing at about the thirty minute mark. It gets all the important information out in that time, too.There has been some concern that Jackson (and the studios) are milking this tale somewhat and I do share those concerns. I think two movies would have been quite enough to tell the tale, not three. I expect the second part of the trilogy will spend an eternity in Mirkwood, with a lot of action centered around Dol Guldur, before finishing up at Esgaroth. The final movie I expect will be almost non-stop action, God-help us! All in all, however, a very watchable movie. I would have preferred less clownishness and more glowering, however, but that is just me.SUMMARY: A little confused as to who it is targeting, audience-wise. Slow to start, but doesn't let up once it gets going. A little overlong, in my opinion.",8,1,5,6 January 2013
The Princess Bride," Inconceivably good fun!
","I have a fond spot for this movie. Its gentle humour and simple values (and perhaps offputting title) combine to make a movie that just keeps going and going.If you asked any person in the street to tell you what sort of film might star the diverse talents of Peter Falk, Fred Savage, Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, Billy Crystal and Peter Cook, they might have a hard time coming up with an answer. I can't think of a more varied cast for any film.If a film leaves you muttering some line of dialogue for days, or even weeks after you've watched it, then you know it must be pretty good. But when a film drags that same line out of you year after year after year, then you know it must be something special. You too will look incredulous when something goes wrong in your life and the word 'Inconceivable!' will spring unbidden to your lips. Trust me, it happens.Princess Bride is an action comedy that must be seen to be believed. There are no flashy special effects, no CGI. Just simple, honest comedy and action.Strongly recommended.",10,1,1,21 January 2003
28 Days Later...," London never looked better!
","Given that I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic movies it wasn't much of a surprise to me that I liked this film. Sure, it's low-budget and the storyline is very low key - no planet saving heroics a la Reign of Fire here - but it still kept me entertained nonetheless.It's also far from original, though, and borrows quite heavily from Romero's 'Dead' series of films. But considering we live in an era where they are remaking such untouchable classics as 'The Italian Job' and 'Casablanca' I don't think a bit of plagiarism goes amiss here and there.There are plot holes, but none so glaring as the aformentioned Reign of Fire's plot craters. But on the whole it's a solid piece of work and a worthy addition to the post-apocalypse genre. Although it's received some negative comments, I actually liked the DV nature of the production which gave the movie a grittier look to it. And I thought London had never looked better, frankly!",7,0,0,15 April 2003
2012," Should be renamed '2,012 daring escapes by aeroplane!'
","First off, the best thing about this movie are the CGI effects. I take off my metaphorical hat to the people involved in the creation of the visual goodness on screen. They went to a great deal of effort and, without a shadow of a doubt, their work is the most creative thing about this film. Well done guys! The 5/10 I gave this film is entirely down to your efforts.Now the not so good. Where to start...Firstly, if you're expecting a drama about people coping with the end of the world you will be disappointed. This movie focuses entirely on one family and their efforts to survive. Of course, they are a dysfunctional family. That way the scriptwriters can perform what I'll laughingly refer to as 'character development' in order to get the family back in order again by the end of the film.Apart from the family, the rest of the cast are limited to playing awful stereotypical roles such as Russian Oligarch, spoilt rich kids, noble scientist, holy man, crackpot conspiracy theorist etc etc. You get the idea. These other characters, unlike the family, are not 'developed' during the film. In fact, their sole purpose appears to be to die at appropriate moments during the film once their usefulness to the family is at an end.Essentially, the movie is one long chase scene, with the family narrowly avoiding death (usually by plane) with increasingly foolish scenes of 'nail-biting tension'. But realistically, once you've seen them avoid death by taking off in a plane for the THIRD time, you begin to wonder just how flimsy the script was in order that they had to repeat essentially the same scene again and again.Oh yeah, call me nerdy if you must, but I imagine that, when the runway drops out from beneath your plane into a gaping chasm there would be a certain amount of suction trying to pull your plane in. Guess that one (repeatedly) escaped the physics advisors attention.Though the film trailers make a big thing of the 2012 Mayan apocalypse, this is only touched on briefly during the film. It's essentially a marketing gimmick designed to draw in impressionable fools. Likewise, the 'science' explanation behind the cause of the disaster is only touched on vaguely and then forgotten. It's almost as if they were embarrassed to let the audience dwell on the absurdity of it for too long.The dialogue is also some of the most awful I've heard in a long time, but it's the lack of intelligence behind it that insults me the the most. For instance, in one scene the President of the US lets his daughter in on the disaster looming, telling her 'Only 6 people in the entire administration know what I'm about to tell you!' Yeah, right. That would be the 6 people other than the tens of thousands of rich billionaires who are funding the project, apparently, and who all seem to know what is going on. Yep, that would be a really easy secret to keep.And whilst we are on the subject of who gets to go aboard the ships and all, just what chimp thought that one up as a believable scenario? That thousands of rich idiots would be the best gene-pool for rebuilding human society? If our species really was that shallow then we honestly wouldn't deserve to survive the apocalypse.So in summary, all I can say is, watch the movie (if you must) for the effects, but don't expect either good characterisations or dialogue, let alone a sensible plot. I recommend several stiff drinks beforehand, and probably it's a good idea to smuggle a bottle into the cinema with you, just to take the edge off. You'll need it before the end..",5,0,0,12 December 2009
Hellboy," An occult version of Men In Black.
","Or at least, that's what it seemed to me. The similarities are very strong. Just replace aliens with evil demon thingies and you're set!That said, I actually liked this film quite a lot, probably due to the casting of Ron Perlman as Hellboy. He has a whale of a time in the title role, though you can't help but wonder how hot it got under his massive body suit and prosthetics. The rest of the cast are really along for the ride and don't have a great deal to do, though Hellboy's Man-from-Atlantis side-kick, Aqua Sapiens (or some-such) has a few good lines and at least one good underwater scene.There is also more than a touch of the Lovecraftian genre about the nature of the beasties that Hellboy has to face. Vast entities slumbering in the void, just waiting to be awakened etc. And lots of tentacles and slime. It all adds up to good fun, no matter how much plagiarism and borrowing there has been.It's pleasant to see that Hollywood can chuck out a decent comic conversion after the awful Hulk and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen fiascos. Of course, I've yet to see Catwoman, so I won't get too enthusiastic. But at least it shows they can do it, if they want to.Worth a look.",8,0,0,5 July 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Excellent work, but not quite as good as the first movie
","For a start, ignore the fanboys who decry Peter Jackson's efforts as 'Not Tolkien's story' or other such comments. Of course it isn't. It's Peter Jackson's version of it. That's why, apparently missed by the rabid Tolkien-ites, all such films, somewhere in their credits, have the comment 'Based on the novel xxx by xxxx.....'. So, given that it isn't intended to be a word-for-word rehash of the book, why shout it down for that?What the Two Towers is, however, is solid action-fantasy cinema that picks up right where the first movie finished and runs with the ball. Personally, I didn't think it was quite as good as the first movie, but then, it would have had to be fantastic to be so. All sequels are 'more of the same' to an extent, so it's hard to be as good as the original, but this one comes pretty close.There were things I wished I could see more of in this movie, like the Ents attack on Isengard, or maybe where Gimli discovers the caves at Helm's Deep (which wasn't in there at all), but I'm hopeful that the extended DVD release will add little extras like this back into the story as the extended DVD of FOTR did.I was a little puzzled to see the Elves at Helm's Deep. I don't recall that from the book, but who cares really? It seemed logical that they would come to help. Nice addition.Gollum was a truly amazing piece of CGI. I don't think he looked THAT realistic, but what made him work for me was the expression that they got into his features. Amazing stuff, especially the 'Good Smeagol, Bad Gollum' internal struggle. Incidentally, on a humorous note, there were people in the audience that didn't get that bit. I heard at least two people (adults) wondering out loud where the second Gollum came from!I also think that it was a shame Shelob didn't make it into this one. T'would have made a good cliff-hanger ending for the second film to have Frodo apparently dead and Sam alone. But as it was, those of us who know the story can know anticipate the appearance of Ungoliant's spawn in much the same way as we anticipated Gollum's appearance.If there was one thing that I'm not sure is a good idea, it's the increasingly acrobatic Legolas. I almost hate to think what he'll get up to in the final installment. But I'll still go and see it!All in all, this is a worthy follow-up to FOTR and well worth your time. It will certainly be making an appearance in my DVD collection as soon as the extended version is released.",9,0,0,4 July 2003
The Incredibles," The Incredibly Mediocre Movie..
","Don't get me wrong...it has its moments. But they are few and far between in this film.The decision to make the story more 'real' by having the superheroes portrayed as an ordinary family with ordinary family problems went a long way to disappoint me, even though I had expected this from reviews. To me 'ordinary' and 'super' are two words that should never get mixed together. I appreciate the movie's thought that, if everyone had superpowers, then everyone would be ordinary, but come on. I want to be entertained, not run through an updated episode of The Flintstones.Another nail in the coffin for this one was the hype. Once again, the movie moguls hype up a film, raising our expectations to silly levels. How can we be anything but disappointed with the reality?If you compare this movie to the likes of Toy Story or Finding Nemo it doesn't even come close to being in the same league.Unlike those movies, where a bit of affectionate scene plagiarism was appreciated for what it was, The Incredibles just annoyed the Hell out of me with its 'Return of the Jedi' jungle chase scene. A quick flit through the jungle with the hero being chased by the bad guys - just long enough for you to realize it for what it was - would have been fine. But no. They had to drag the scene out for minute after minute, adding in all the scenes from the RoTJ chase, such as the enemy drawing alongside, the swinging from the vines etc. until you were sick of it and praying it would end.There are some good ideas, but on the whole the film doesn't get my thumbs up of approval. Once again, partly the hype to blame, but also mostly because it's not that good.",6,8,21,24 November 2004
Driven," Driven.......to distraction
","It's hard to know where to begin to review this movie. At first glance it's harmless enough, but there was a lot about it that annoyed me. So rather than waste a lot of time analysing the merits (or lack thereof) of this film I'll be flippant with the following comments:Things this movie taught me:1. Young race car drivers are, apparently, so immature as to think that a couple of drinks with a pretty girl means that she wants to have their babies and are willing to get into fisticuffs to protect their (entirely imagined) relationship.2. If a driver is injured he doesn't need to see a trained physician to certify him race fit. All he needs to do is hop up and down on a busted ankle for the gratification of his sado-masochistic, wheelchair-bound boss.3. If you're a naughty race-car driver you can drive your 200mph, non-street legal Indycar on public highways and the only consequence of this life-endangering stunt will be a small fine.4. It is also perfectly acceptable to spin your race car 180 degrees and drive the wrong way around the race track, endangering other drivers, so long as you're doing it to save a friend from a horrible (but well deserved) flaming death.5. Wives, girlfriends and brothers of race drivers (or just about anyone who knows them) can not only stand in the team control booth in a self-important manner, but also give orders to the drivers as if they were the team boss.6. Tyres that come off cars in accidents can fly hundreds of feet into the air, go over the safety fence, and fall amongst the crowd. But don't worry. So long as you aren't hit when it lands you are safe. Rubber tyres apparently don't bounce at all when hitting concrete bleachers.All in all then, this movie is less than impressive. On a scale of 1 to rancid this film gets a solid 4 and a half lard blocks (most of the lard was on Burt Reynolds - will he never give up?)Not worth the effort.",4,50,86,16 July 2004
I Am Legend," A great effort that doesn't quite hit the spot...
","I have to say, I had been looking forward to this film all year, so it is with quite some disappointment that I say that it didn't really work as well as I had hoped.Don't get me wrong, it is still a good movie, and worth watching, but there are a number of things that don't work about it.Firstly the good points, though. Will Smith is pretty darned good as Robert Neville, the title character and gives a solid performance as the lonely, slightly 'lost' last man on Earth. Likewise his sole companion, a German Shepherd dog, is very much a character in its own right which, as it turns out later, is exactly what the writers intended - that, like Neville, you get attached to it. The visuals of an abandoned Manhattan are extremely well done and the sense of emptiness is quite convincingly portrayed. So....all good so far.But now the less good parts. Firstly, the over-reliance on CGI. I'm not spoiling the film to tell anyone that, in fact, Neville is not alone in Manhattan. But the overuse of CGI to portray the 'creatures' does spoil things, I'm afraid. Whats more, I don't see why they had to go to such lengths to do this to what are - essentially - humans gone mad. I'm sure a far more convincing effect could be had with simple make-up effects. Of course, the CGI does allow them to show the apparent superhuman abilities of the infected, which is another gripe I'll come back to later.Although the creatures are the worst part of the film, another element that grates is (and my usual pet hate) the lack of intelligence on the part of the writers. We learn during the film that Neville is hunting the creatures (he has a map on which he crosses out buildings he has searched) and that the creatures have abnormally high body temperatures. Given the apparent military background of Neville wouldn't it make sense for him to employ some sort of thermal tracking in order to locate them? After all the city is completely devoid of any man-made heat sources other than the creatures and Neville himself? Or failing that, since he can apparently catch the creatures without too much trouble, why not simply put some kind of tracking device on (or in) the creature and then release it? Going back to the superhuman creatures - I really don't get where this comes from. Their body temperature, respiration, blood pressure etc. are all off the scale. What maintains this? What is it that allows them to be hit by a speeding car and get and run off unhurt? They climb like monkeys, run like cheetahs and are as strong as bears. All in a human body (albeit coated in CGI). What maintains this? Do they even eat? If so I would ask....what? There are no people apart from Neville, they don't appear to feast on each other and the animal life in the city hardly appears numerous enough to support them. Plus, with those metabolisms, they'd have to eat huge quantities to fuel themselves for each nights rampage.In 28 Days Later, the infected eventually starved through lack of coherent meal plans. But in I Am Legend, we're three years down the road from when the infection took place. How are they surviving? It's things like these that really annoy me about movies. I know, I shouldn't think that deeply about what is, essentially, a popcorn movie. But these inconsistencies just glare out at me from the screen.However, the bottom line...Leaving aside the CGI and the illogical writing I Am Legend is quite a good movie. It was rather short at 90 minutes. I think there's probably quite a good mini-series in this franchise if anyone was brave enough to take up the challenge, but I doubt it will happen.But...If I was offered a choice between I Am Legend and 28 Days Later, I would choose the latter simply because it doesn't insult my intelligence quite as much.EDIT: After some time to reflect I think the movie has grown on me some more. I do recommend watching the alternate ending version on the DVD which, to me, completely switches the roles that Neville and the creatures play and is altogether far more satisfying a conclusion than the original.",8,1,3,23 December 2007
A Quiet Place," A Quite Unrealistic Place...
","So, I found the acting decent and I'm sure the movie was well-intentioned, but oh man... that attention to detail (or lack thereof).It is a noticeable trend in some kinds of post-apocalyptic and especially dystopian fiction, that the setting does not need to make sense. All that matters is the setting and the premise that goes along with it. This is a fallacy that, whilst sometimes making a story that is, at first glance, entertaining and fun, does not hold up to any kind of scrutiny at all. The Total Recall remake, The Titan, Snowpiercer, The Divergent series... the list is endless of such movies that eschew common sense in favour of artificial worlds that have about as much chance of ever existing as dragons and unicorns.A Quiet Place, though not quite so egregious a transgressor as the aforementioned titles, nonetheless follows this trend with a poorly thought out setting that fails the scrutiny test.In this film, the world has been taken over (somehow) by creatures that hunt by sound and are noted as being armoured and near invincible. They are swift, relentless killers that seemingly are animalistic in nature and lack much in the way of cunning.Our heroes are a single family, trying to live a silent existence so as not to draw the attention of the beasts, which will spell almost certain death. The film shows their attempts to do this.Sounds fair enough, right? Yeah, but that execution, though...There are many plot holes and things to scowl at in this movie. Here we go.The family walks around with no shoes on to make less noise. A simple pair of slippers would have sufficed, but no...barefeet for all, despite the risk of stepping on something and getting a wound...then infection etc. In fact, that risk is probably the sole (foot joke unintended) reason that this made it into the story. The minute you see it, you know someone is going to step on something at some point. However, in the way that they do it, a pair of slippers would have also worked just as well as barefoot.The family spreads sand around to provide a soft path to walk on and deaden footfalls but despite having lived at the farm they are occupying for a year or more, there is no source of that sand shown. Presumably it would have blown away/been washed away with the rain etc. but no sandpit is in evidence.The family resorts to makeshift soundproofing in their home but has possibly the world's best equipped electronics workshop in the basement. They have radios, oscilloscopes, security cameras and all kinds of tech, despite seemingly living out in the middle of nowhere. Yet they have no actual soundproofing. If they could find all this tech, surely they could have found better soundproofing than egg boxes and newspaper glued to the walls.Despite having all this electronic gear, the father (who is shown to be good at electronics) doesn't think to rig up any kind of remote decoys using his tech. In this way, when the monsters attack the home, the only way they have of distracting the beasts is to send a child off to light some fireworks (No...really!) The father has the skills to rig up security cameras and to try and fix his deaf daughter's hearing aid, yet he doesn't know how to rig a simple sounder away from the house that can be activated from inside the house? No...just no.The creatures are also poorly realised. Hunting by sound, with hearing so sensitive that any inadvertant noise will bring them running, it should have been anyone's first thought to use that dependence against them. Use sound to lure them someplace, then destroy them. Oh but wait, I forgot, they are indestructible. Silly me. Nothing on Earth could prevent these things from rampaging the globe and destroying civilisation. Not tanks, or A10's or explosives... Oh but a shotgun to the face will do it... Huh? What's wrong with this picture! Did everyone involved with it just forget the rules they made at the beginning? Oh but it was a cool scene, so that trumps common sense and pre-established rules, I guess. These same beasts later are shown to be incredibly strong, ripping through a grain silo easily, but then later having issues getting through the roof of a pickup truck.Also, I know the family loses a kid right at the start of the film, but who in their right minds would get pregnant in this setting? That's right...no one! Yet this family clearly is mental and decides to bring a newborn into this setting. Now, I don't know a lot about babies, but I do know one thing. They cry. A lot. Does this mother and father have so little regard to their other two children's safety that they would risk bringing a noisy baby into the world? Am I misreading the story? Or are the pair of them that self-centred that replacing the child they lost is more important than preserving the life of the two they still have?Yeah, folks, this isn't a well-written tale. Plenty of drama and tension, plenty of CGI monster action, but not a lick of common sense to be found.You know how, down the pub, you've had those discussions with your semi-inebriated mates about 'What would you do in a zombie apocalypse?' And you know how they come up with some pretty good ideas sometimes? Yeah, well, nobody consulted their drunken mates on this one, and it shows.SUMMARY: Poorly executed setting. Family not too smart. Plot holes and a general lack of sense to the whole thing that spoils what could have been a great concept. Consult more drunks next time, their ideas will be better.",5,10,21,22 May 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Pirates of the Caribbean 5: Dead Inside
","Oh boy! Where to start...It comes to something when you realise that the best and most lively (and therefore worthwhile watching) acting comes from the people portraying the dead in this movie.Without exception, everyone else (and especially Depp) just give low effort that makes you wonder if they really wanted to be there. Whether that is the actors or the director's fault is not readily apparent, but what is apparent is that it is lacking. Severely.Dead Men Tell No Tales is shell of a movie, put together from parts that the writers think will be great, but without taking any time to think if they should be there at all. Thus, we get bloated action sequences that attempt to one-up the previous Pirates movies, but which suffer from the same deplorable 'Too much of a good thing' that now plagues the Fast and Furious franchise.It isn't as bad as the previous outing but it shows that it is struggling. Javier Bardem tries his best as the villain of the piece and, as I mentioned, being one of the 'dead' characters in the movie, stands out from the rest by virtue of that fact. But the others...I'm also unsure if Orlando Bloom just didn't want to be in this movie. Was he strong-armed contractually into what is little more than a cameo role along with Keira Knightley, or did the writers think that leaving those two characters out and bringing in two almost identical replacements would be a good idea? Will the new pair replace them in future outings? Are Bloom and Knightley just done with the franchise? Is this the Pirates equivalent of Star Trek The Next Generation? If so, then swapping out two of the old characters for near identical replacements and making up some hokum to tie them into the story is a real slap in the face to the franchise's fans. Hey everyone! We heard you like a young couple in your Pirates film, so we put a young couple in to replace the young couple we used to have that grew old and demanded too much money/couldn't be bothered anymore/saw how bad the movies were becoming. Enjoy! It is all rather cynical and obvious. They should have stopped after the third film and just left it as it was. But no, they churned out a fourth (awful) movie, and now a fifth. But don't despair! The end credits not-so subtly promise a sixth outing, so maybe that will be good...right? Right? Okay, enough disappointment! I'm off to watch The Dark Tower next! That'll be a big improvement, right? Right? SUMMARY: Tired rehash that has tired actors tiredly rehashing their tired characters. Tired plot. Tired story and tired action. Just tired everything, really. Only watch if you are really, desperately, tired.",5,4,6,12 September 2017
K-19: The Widowmaker," Formulaic and predictable, but solid enough
","This movie wasn't ever going to be a 'major motion picture' event. It had an old storyline and the plot developments were about as predictable as you can get. If you are going to do a story that people know the outcome to, you had best make that story only incidental to the 'real' plot. Titanic did this, making the sinking of the ship secondary to the love story/triangle between DiCaprio, Winslett and Zane.There was some attempt to do this with the character development between Ford and Neeson, but it was all so predictable that it never really worked to push the sub disaster into the background. Also, I was never really convinced by the way Ford ended up the hero. SPOILERS AHEAD. He'd commanded the sub like an idiot beforehand and the friction between him and Neeson built nicely until.....mutiny! Neeson staunchest supporter and the boat's political officer wrest control from the maniacal Ford and what does Neeson do? He frees Ford and imprisons his buddy and the political officer? To me that didn't come across as a loyal officer supporting his superior and the chain of command (as it seemed intended to) Instead it came across as Neeson's character realising the s*** was on the fan and not wanting to take control of the situation. In short, showing his loyalty by keeping Ford in charge to take all the crap that was sure to come of the situation.To summarize then, this film has:The obligatory sub disaster. The crazed captain who redeems himself. The coward who redeems himself by saving the boat. The heroic crew who are loyal to the Motherland. etc. etc.Despite all this, the movie is entertaining enough, but not really one that you'll watch again and again. Although, I would like to know what happened to the crewman who jumped overboard from the sub and made a swim for the American destroyer. Did he make it? Did he drown? Did he become an American citizen? Was he handed back to the Russians?Oh well.",7,2,3,13 January 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Weird, but lots of fun
","When my girlfriend bought this on DVD I must admit to being less than impressed. There followed many weeks of 'Shall we watch this tonight' to which I replied 'I'm not really in the mood for it.' To be honest, I was deathly afraid of being subjected to another musical after being scarred by Chicago. However, when the evening finally came that we sat down to watch Moulin Rouge, I was very pleasantly surprised.It has a style that is unique. It's weird and wacky and doesn't even pretend to contain anything like an original song. In fact the exact opposite is true as it it shamelessly borrows any song remotely relevant to the storyline. In fact, trying to spot all the song references let alone the songs themselves becomes quite a game.It's difficult to sum up Moulin Rouge. It's just fun, fast paced and never lets go of your interest for a moment. Initially, however, be prepared for a certain amount of confusion as your head (if it's anything like mine and was expecting a dreary Chicago-style dirge-fest) struggles to get a feel for the style and pace of the film. After that it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride right to the end. The simple plot has no surprises and you know what'll happen pretty much right from the start, but the story isn't what makes this movie entertaining. It's the music - a fact lost on the Chicago writers.Maybe I just like weird musicals but this one rates up there just behind Rocky Horror and Shop of Horrors on my list. Well worth a watch.",8,1,2,25 July 2004
X-Men: Apocalypse," Formula superhero movie
","I know, right? Who would have thought it? A superhero movie where the heroes discover a great threat to humanity and then overcome it.So, yes, this is pretty much a by-the-numbers effort from all involved in the X-Men franchise. There is nothing here to really make you go wow, or gasp in surprise. The reason being that you have already seen the action scenes in countless other superhero movies and any twists there might have been are entirely blanked out by the hero mantra that 'good must always win the day'.So is there anything to recommend this film? Well, it isn't Batman vs Superman, or Fantastic 4, so it is immediately not the worst superhero movie ever. But it is very generic. I honestly don't see the need for the hundreds of superheroes when they all are essentially the same character, just with different powers.If there is any bright spot to this movie, it is that the complete and utter lack of imagination throughout most of its running time is entirely thrown into sharp focus by the scenes involving Quicksilver. Unlike the rest of the movie, where standard mayhem and violence ensue with the kind of gleeful (yet boring) world destroying force we have all come to expect, Quicksilver's scenes at what could have been.The imagination and fun that clearly went into devising his scenes of inhumanly fast movement shine like a beacon in an otherwise rather dimly-lit movie. It is hard not to like this character, who is able to effectively move so fast the rest of the world seems to stand still. The fun they have with his one big scene is clear, and harks back to an era when superheros could be fun and not scowl-faced gritty impersonations of themselves. Quicksilver, in his way, is the less-sweary cousin to Deadpool. There is an irreverence to him that I hope they don't ruin with 'character development' and, of all the myriad of heroes getting their own movies, one starring him would be the only one I would be interested in seeing.However, beyond Quicksilver, there isn't much to really draw you into the film. The rest of the X-Men get decent enough screen time, though I kind of wish they'd just be done with the origins stories and get on with the group as a team. And, I'm sorry, but James McAvoy's school for mutants is increasingly starting to seem more like Hogwarts than it is a place for mutants to come into their own.The movie, as I said, is capably done, but it isn't anything you haven't seen before (excepting Quicksilver) and leaves you feeling 'Meh!' more than anything else.There is the obligatory Staneo and, for no reason other than fan-service, Wolverine makes a brief appearance as a kind of Maguffin to get the students out of a tough spot. His appearance is entirely unnecessary but just done so that they can say he is in the movie.All in all, this is a formula movie with no surprises.SUMMARY: Formula hero flick with nothing particular to recommend it. Not awful, but just more of the same you've now seen countless times before.",7,3,7,11 June 2016
Meet Joe Black," Brad Pitt gets run over....what's not to like?
","Well...OK, I guess there are a few things.For one, the movie is a loooong one. Most of this is due to the 'meaningful' pauses between exchanges of dialogue. Sometimes this is actually teeth-grittingly painful to be subjected to and you want to almost scream at them to say something, anything, instead of staring at each other.The second thing that detracted from the film was Anthony Hopkins. He's a fine actor, to be sure, but here he seemed almost totally bored with proceedings. Some of his lines are mind-numbingly delivered. Sometimes he actually seems to be struggling to remember them. He's like someone's old grandad that was asked to fill in when the real actor failed to show.Pitt is his usual wooden self, though here that actually works in his favour as he comes across even more oddly than usual.But despite these failings, the movie still succeeds in its romantic notion that Death can learn love and that things kind of turn out for the best in the end.In short, it is worth a watch at least once. But I don't think you'll get much more out of it by sitting through it more than that. Not convinced? Well, my partner decided to watch it on TV the other night, adamant that she hadn't yet seen it, only to admit about half-way through that she recalled it from a few years back.If that doesn't tell you how unmemorable most of it is, I don't know what will.",7,3,4,11 September 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Dull, overlong and unconvincing.
","After sitting through this endurance test, I'm consoling myself with the fact that, in maybe five to ten years time, they will reboot the franchise again and have another go at getting it right.Spiderman 2 is about forty minutes too long. There is so much unnecessary backstory and drivel in here that it is painful to sit through. I mean, if we didn't know Spiderman's story to death thanks to the fact that we've had now five movies in twelve years essentially rehashing the same story, it wouldn't be so bad. But we have had those movies. Even if you hated the Tobey Maguire trilogy, you still remember the story, right? So why do they feel the need to go over the same ground again and again is beyond me. Perhaps they think that ten years equates to a 'new generation' of movie-goers. I don't know.Anyway, what you do get is one hundred and forty minutes of same old, same old. Same old angst-driven spidey not knowing whether he wants the girl or not. Yawn.As far as villains go, they couldn't even leave green goblin to die. They had to resurrect him in the form of his son. I have no idea whether this is canon in the comics or not, but it is a cheap way to bring back an old character.Whilst I'm on about cheap writing... is there no one writing screenplays anymore that don't have dialogue and scenes you can predict well in advance? I mean, if I know what a character is going to say before they say it, despite being distracted by shiny CGI and technowizardry, what does that say about how long it took the writer to come up with the crap? When I sat down to watch this, I realised that I couldn't remember a single thing that happened in the previous movie and, I suspect the same will be true when I inevitably go and watch Spiderman 3. They are just watch and forget movies.The one thing that they sort of got right was spidey's humour, at least in the first ten minutes. After that, there was precious little to smile about, let me tell you! CGI is abundant, of course and, at least for the characters, not too shabby. Apart from being a clone of Mr Freeze from the Batman movies, Electro looked the part.Where the CGI scored less well, however, is in my favourite pet hate... physics abuse. Spiderman swings about on his webs with ridiculous speed. It's like he is rocket propelled half the time, even when simply falling straight down. Also, I get he's virtually indestructible, but Gwen isn't. There is a scene where he swoops down on his web and snatches her from a standing position and swoops away, all with out stopping. Not only would that have killed her then and there from the impact, but his speed would have dropped considerably. Does no one look at this and think 'You know what...that's stupid.' during the film-making process? The plot was a mess. The dialogue trite and cheesy in equal measure and the characterisations were woeful. Not since Anakin Skywalkers ineptly orchestrated turning to the dark-side have I seen such awful ham-fisted about-faces for character motivations. Mild mannered techno-nerd Max becomes evil Electro simply because Spiderman forgot his name. Harry Osborne goes from Peter Parker's best friend to psychotic lunatic in the blink of an eye.It's all rather tragic, really. But the real tragedy, considering how many people put at least some effort into it, is this: Even now, mere hours after watching it, the details are hazy. I might suspect early-onset Alzheimer's, except that I can recall with painful clarity even other poor recent movies such as Godzilla. So this tells me that Spiderman 2 will be a movie forgotten in ten years time. No one will be able to tell you what happened in it without looking it up.And you know what? Perhaps that is for the best.SUMMARY: Dull, too long and instantly forgettable. People will be talking about this film for minutes after they have left the theatre. Almost any other superhero movie is more enjoyable.",5,6,14,27 July 2014
Ex Machina," One big yawn-fest from start to finish.
","So, here's the thing about the Turing test, which is supposed to figure so prominently in this movie, but actually nothing like it ever happens.... you aren't supposed to know whether the subject you are talking to is human or not. It is, essentially, a blind test. Typically administered through a text only conversation on a terminal. In this movie, they not only have the main character sit face to face with the android, but they employ plenty (of admittedly impressive) CGI so that you are in no doubt he is talking to a machine. That instantly invalidates the test, in my opinion, which is supposed to leave it up to the observer to decide, based on the AI's responses, if it is, in fact, an artificially generated response, or is a human.Aside from this nonsense, the movie tries very hard to be clever but fails due to the lack of anything like pacing - it crawls along like a snail, leaving the viewer taking deep breaths and wondering when anything interesting will happen.It is sad, really. The potential was there, but the execution was poor. There have been any number of decent AI-related films in the past few years that have done a much better job of portraying their subject matter than this one. The Machine, for example.Here, we are treated to a shonky thriller where the motivations of all concerned are not clear. It should be interesting. It should be. But it isn't. It is a wasted opportunity. A dull two hours that I won't get back.SUMMARY: Boring and dull. Tries to be clever and fails. Not one to sit through once, to be honest, let alone a second time.",4,6,15,17 May 2015
Transformers," Transformers....Michael Bay in disguise....badly
","Hmmm....where to start. Well, its a Michael Bay film, so I was fairly certain I'd get plenty of action, which is true of the movie. I also expected, and was not unpleasantly gratified to note, that common sense would play second fiddle to creating contrived scenes in order to generate a more 'vibrant' feel. This last isn't always a bad thing, but common sense must be paid at least lip-service or things just end up looking foolish.In Transformers, the heroes insult your intellect by having the super-power module, The Allspark, taken from its hidden repository and transported into the middle of a major city. What's wrong with this picture? Oh yeah, the incredibly violent badbots(TM) are sure to follow and rain carnage on said city. Duh! Common sense is...drive it out to the desert, wait until the badbots (TM) show up, then nuke the lot of them. Problem solved.Despite this typical Bay foolishness, the movie entertains well enough and moves along at a fair pace. It IS fun, but could have been a lot better. Characters are reasonable drawn, except for the bots, who you are almost expected to know before you go to watch the movie. The effects of the transformation sequences are well done, but happen a bit too quickly for you to fully appreciate them. In fact, a lot of the action takes place at such a pace that you can lose track of who's where, fighting who etc.There are a lot of comic bits that serve to add nothing to the film other than grate on the nerves, however. The tiny scoutbot that tracks the hero (Shia LaBouef) is particularly pointless and comical, uttering needless little growls and squawks that put you in mind of Gremlins. Utterly stupid.However, as I have mentioned, the film isn't awful. With a bit more attention to sense, rather than contrived scenes, it could have been great.",6,1,5,26 September 2007
Men in Black II," Men in Black v1.1
","Yes, it's sequel time again! I finally got around to watching this recently and I have to say I think I've found the perfect way to enjoy any movie. First, you have to listen to all the negative reviews of the film, then go and see it. You'll be expecting something so dire that the reality will be a pleasant surprise, nay, even enjoyable. Such was the case with MIB2.That said, though, this has to be one of the most blatant 'let's redo the first movie' sequels that I've ever seen. Let's recap...In the first movie the MIB have to recover the 'galaxy on Orion's belt' or the Earth will be destroyed. The love interest comes in the form of a morgue worker who falls for Will Smith. There's a big-ass alien monster that the MIB have a showdown with at the end. There's a scene with the MIB's car flying.In this sequel the MIB have to recover the 'light of Zartha' or the Earth will be destroyed. The love interest comes in the form of a waitress who falls for Will Smith. There's a big-ass alien monster that the MIB have a showdown with at the end. There's a scene with the MIB's car flying.You begin to get the idea? This isn't so much of a sequel as a blatant remake. The Italian Job remake is more different from its original than MIB2 is from its predecessor.Having got that out of the way, the film still manages to amuse, though there are moments where it does make you groan rather than laugh, the jokes being so predictable. But still, it has its moments. Frank the Pug is one of them. There's also more screen time for Tony Shalhoub's 'Jeebs' character this time around, though there are only so many times you can see his head explode and grow back before it gets stale.Tommy Lee Jones seems to be totally bored this time around. One wonders if he was dragged kicking and screaming  back to the set due to contractual obligations. His usual deadpan delivery really did look as if he wished he were dead. Overall though, nothing spectacular. I have to say that I'm finding it increasingly difficult to feel any sympathy with Hollywood studios over movie piracy when they churn out such blatant money-spinners as this.Never mind. Let's just hope there isn't a MIB 3!",5,0,0,28 July 2003
Garden State," OK, but somewhat over-hyped
","There's nothing wrong with Garden State. It's a competent film that delivers a gentle, if somewhat awkwardly laid-out plot. There are times when you'll be wondering what the relevance of several scenes are, and other times when your attention will wander.But mostly it rewards the perseverance of its viewers with its ending which, although horribly predictable and Hollywoodey, still manages to raise a smile.But Garden State does suffer from hype. A full half of all IMDb votes rate this a 10. Maybe I saw a different version of the film, but I doubt it. There's a growing trend of 'following the loudest voice' when it comes to rating movies (and I don't mean just on IMDb, but generally in all reviews). People will read a review and think that the film must be good simply because someone else said so, and rate the movie accordingly, even though they privately might not have rated it that highly. Oh well, I guess that's how the Academy Awards work anyhow.I won't say Garden State is entirely a feel-good movie either. At times it's a feel-bored movie, but not that often. Neither is it a comedy. It has it's moments, but they are not laugh-out-loud moments so much as snigger-and-chuckle moments.In short, it's a movie that isn't certain what it wants to be. A mixed bag that does none of its elements proper justice. A Jack-of-all-Trades movies that, ultimately, doesn't satisfy as well as it could have.But, that said, its a very good first effort from Zach Braff and miles better than 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' - Clooneys first effort. So not all first efforts suck. And Braff is heading towards superstardom, whether he wants (or knows) it, or not.",7,8,16,4 December 2004
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars: The Last Straw
","So, I wasn't much pleased with the Force Awakens. It was too derivative and too much like a reboot to be considered 'good'. But, like many others, I told myself that the proof of the pudding would be in the next movie, and where that took the story.Well folks, that pudding is truly one rancid piece of fruit cake. The Last Jedi looks fantastic. The score is great. The effects are generally awesome. However, story and character-wise, it is a mess. Someone poured week-old custard on that fruit cake, and it leaves a real bad taste in the mouth.The main problem, which I wondered about in the previous movie, is that the writers have precisely no idea what to do with the original trilogy characters. In TFA, Han blunders along like a senior on a day outing, finally being despatched by his own son in just about as unheroic and unsatisfying way it was possible to imagine.In TLJ, Luke is treated just as poorly, being essentially relegated to 'old man complaining them young 'uns'll get hurt if they carry on'. He does precisely nothing for the entirety of the film except issue warnings and doing nothing of any consequence. Finally, when he does appear to confront Darth Emo, the much hoped for display of force-prowess is reduced to 'Hah ha! I'm not really here! Fooled you!'Part of this problem is the reboot aspect I mentioned. Lucasfilm want the franchise to move on with new, younger actors. That is understandable, but the old hold-overs from the previous movies seem like almost an embarrassment to them now. Something to be gotten rid of as soon as possible and never mind if you do them a disservice in the process.As I said, Luke has nothing to do in this movie. Leia, in fact, shows more Jedi skills than he does. It isn't hard to understand now what Mark Hamill was going on about when he said he disagreed with Johnson's take on Luke.But if it was just the older characters being poorly served here, it might still have been a good film, right? Sadly, it isn't so. The story is full of inconsistencies and in hindsight makes little sense. Increasingly, the disconnect between the original trilogy and this new one makes no sense. In the original, the emperor was killed and the rebellion triumphed. All across the galaxy, as shown in the remastered versions, people celebrated the fall of the Empire.In TFA, we are introduced to the First Order, who seem to be what is left of the Empire. They have ships etc, but nowhere is it made clear that they are anything but a subversive force trying to bring the Empire back. Effectively, they are the rebels.In TLJ, now the rebels are rebels again, fighting to overthrow the First Order, who seem suddenly to be much more powerful. They have a new 'emperor', in the form of Snoke, and seem to be in charge again.There is no consistency to this timeline. Who is Snoke? He seems in this movie to know a lot about Vader and the Skywalkers, but no explanation for this knowledge, or who he is, is given. Not that it matters, because he is now dead, done away with as casually as any of the old guard. Likewise with Captain Phasma, who had potential as a nemesis figure - dead.And Leia, or as she should be known... Skywalker Poppins. Blown into space and yet surviving with a display of force powers that makes Luke's old trench run seem like he drifted off to sleep.That is the main problem with this new trilogy - not enough is explained that needs explaining. The entirety of this new trilogy so far is focused on whizzbang effects, pointless firefights, super-weapons, disposing of characters deemed pointless to the plot and glossing over details that leave people scratching their heads in confusion.Oh, and Porgs. Let's not forget the truly ground-breaking, original and totally not merchandise-based cute lifeforms that play such an important part in the movie.I have no idea what is going on with this franchise anymore. Other than an excuse to print money, Disney seem to be intent (and content) to just churn out garbage with the Star Wars tag on it. They are laughing all the way to the bank.To think, we gave Lucas himself so much grief for the prequels that we were happy to see Disney buy him out. What a hollow victory that seems now and what masterpieces the prequels seem in comparison to this new trilogy.So far, this trilogy has comprised the worst of the Star Wars films. The original trilogy is untouchable. The prequels at least had decent fights, and even Rogue One tried to look at the Star Wars universe differently. This trilogy seems to have no identity of its own. It has a shallow, repeat what has gone before, but do it worse mentality, that I can't see getting better with the final (God I hope it is the final!) movie, now to be made by rehash Abrams.Now all let's wait with mock enthusiasm for the final part, probably to be titled Star Wars: The Re-Return of the Jedi, if I'm any judge.SUMMARY: Fan-fiction by people who hated the original characters. No attention paid to details, no explanations, just more rehashing of older, better content. Dull and yawn-inducing, with new characters that are either annoying, or pointless, and for whom you feel nothing. Not worth your time or money.",4,9,11,26 January 2018
Evil Dead," Not good, or bad. Just leaves you feeling that you've seen it all before...
","...which of course, you have.Now, I generally have decided to put up with remakes because, in some instances, better technology and effects can improve upon an old classic. Likewise, I've gotten used to 're-imaginings' of old movies for the same reason. In fact, as far as I'm concerned, if a remake has a lot of differences from the original, then I'm more happy, because it is more likely that I'll end up appreciating it. Slavish adherence to the original (True Grit, I'm looking at you!) is, as far as I'm concerned, a waste of time.With Evil Dead, we have a franchise that started with a low-budget horror (Evil Dead), was remade into something cheesy (Evil Dead 2)and then spawned a sequel to that cheese (Army of Darkness). I'll admit, I like the Bruce Campbell camp movies the best of all.With this new Evil Dead, there is no comedy. It is an out-and-out horror movie. If there is any humour to be derived from it, it is from watching how Fede Alvarez has dealt with some of the iconic scenes from the original(s). However, that is also where the problem lies.Evil Dead is too close to the original for comfort. It isn't True Grit style cloning, but it leaves you (on first watching) with the feeling that you've seen it before. That ruins any real tension there is in the film. Not only does it allow you to figure out who will survive, but it allows you to correctly anticipate many of the scenes in the movie. All of which, naturally, lessens the enjoyment.Iconic scenes, such as the cutting off of the hand, the chainsaw, the Necronomicon, the tree-rape and so on, are all present in this version and all utterly predictable if you've seen the originals.I guess, if you have not seen those movies, then this comes across as a pretty decent film. But, if you have seen them, then this is just more of the same.I'm not sure we really needed another Evil Dead movie about a cabin in the woods. It's decent, but I have to ask... why? Why not continue the franchise that already existed, even if you had to bring in new characters for that? Why redo the original films again? The worst sin, of course, is making it so like the originals that it doesn't stand out on its own. I think that is what irritates me most about this film. It didn't have the conviction to head off on its own. Even just a little bit of variance would have been nice. But no. Just more of the same.SUMMARY: A decent horror flick but it will leave fans of the originals feeling a little disappointed, I feel.",7,2,12,2 July 2013
Shrek 2," A decent sequel.
","Sequels tend often to be 'more of the same' that you saw in the original. Usually this isn't a particularly good thing, but here in Shrek 2 it's harmless enough fun.Essentially the story evolves into a 'save the wife from the evil sorceress' machinations' deal. The voice acting is good and, much like before, most of the humour comes from Donkey, although he is ably assisted his time round by a new character, Puss (Banderas), who others have rightly said nearly steals the movie.There are lots of references to other fairy tales, of course, and lots of bit-part appearances by characters from such tales. Also present, we have fond rip-offs of such movies as ET and Ghostbusters, to name but a few.All in all it's harmless, entertaining fun and not to be taken too seriously. If there's any moral message to the film then it's probably the same as the first film, namely being who you are, not who others want you to be.A good enough way to spend some time without having to think about anything much.",8,0,0,3 June 2004
Jurassic World," Jurassic World complete with equally ancient clichés!
","So, I liked this movie, but boy is it full of clichés and stereotypes. My partner and I found ourselves calling out every character, what they would end up doing within moments of being introduced to them.Seriously, there is an entire butcher's-worth of ham-fistedness in the approach to character intro's and scene building here. You'll know what will happen long in advance of it actually happening on screen.What this does is make the movie utterly predictable and, in essence, boring. At your first viewing, you will feel like you have seen it before.It also says something about a film featuring dinosaurs that it is at its best when they aren't on screen. I don't know how this came about, but, for the most part, the dino's are a little dull and uninteresting. They plod, they run, they roar, and all in glorious CGI. Yet they fail to evoke the same emotions that they did in JP1 or even 2.That's not to say the human actors are a lot better, but at least they have some thin characterisation applied to them, even if it is in the form of horrible stereotyping.I mean, military guy who is bent on weaponizing the dinos, distant aunt who has no skill with children (bet you can't guess where her story-arc evolves to?) What? Oh yeah, that's right... she does discover her nurturing instincts. Wow! You're better at this than the writers!Don't get me wrong. It is a solid popcorn flick. But the lazy writing does it tremendous harm. I swear they have some sort of software in Hollywood that churns this stuff out. There are no surprises here. None.Acting and Effects are capable. No one really stinks and there aren't that many obvious CGI moments (in so much as we know it is all CGI anyway, nothing shows itself about the perceptual parapet, as it were).It is a decent watch, but expecting the expected is no longer fun when taken to this extreme.SUMMARY: Formulaic and totally predictable. Nothing to write home about. See it, and then move on.",7,167,331,11 July 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A decent film, entirely dominated by Depp
","When I was growing up, I didn't much care for children's stories (I know....stunted childhood...sound of tiny violins playing etc.) and so missed out on any number of classic tales. As an adult, of course, I preferred more mature stories. And so most traditional kids stories are pretty much new territory for me. In some ways this is good - I come to these film versions without any preconceptions - and in other ways bad - I have no idea if the film captures the spirit of the book. All I can do is judge them on how well they entertain me as they are.This version of CATCF is a remake of the Wilder version. I haven't seen this 'original' either, so I can't even compare it to that.All I can say is this: 1. It's pretty entertaining.2. The sets are exceptional.3. Johnny Depp absolutely steals every scene he's in.4. It's all good fun! There's not really anything here that you need worry about letting your little 'uns see. It's all harmless entertainment of a sort that you don't see much of anymore.As I mentioned, I haven't read the book so I can't comment on how faithful a version it is. But I'm guessing it's not that far off the original.Anyway, worth a watch for Depp's scene-stealing, if nothing else.PS: Is there no 'weird' movie he won't do?",7,0,1,1 December 2005
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The Avengers are starting to resemble the Expendables
","So, what I mean by the tagline is this: The Expendables stars a bunch of action heroes involved in ridiculous action set-pieces based around an increasingly unbelievable plot.The Avengers stars a bunch of comic book heroes involved in ridiculous action set-pieces based around an increasingly unbelievable plot.Now, just like in the Expendables, there is almost zero character development. All is gone in favour of endless CGI battles. Whilst I appreciate that we are talking simplistic characters here, I don't think it is unreasonable to expect more. I get it, it is an action movie. It has to have action. But, as the Transformers franchise has shown, all action and no depth makes for uninspired cinema, over-use of CGI and a poor script.Avengers: Ultron is like trying to pour a quart into a pint pot. There's just too many characters vying for screen time and the result is that none of them get the time they deserve.But is it any good as an action movie? Well, to start with. However, at some point it all starts to get very samey. How many robots of doom do we need to see destroyed before we should move on to the next part of the 'plot'? The answer is 'very many' apparently. It becomes tedious and dull after a while.Only at the very end does the film redeem itself somewhat with some actual emotion to go along with the boring action-fest. But by then, it's too little, too late.Remember when everyone hated on Peter Jackson for taking The Hobbit and stretching it out into three movies? Well this is the exact opposite of that. Too much crammed into too little.I don't mind the single hero movies. But when you get so many crowded into one film, it devalues them all.This decade is going to be known as the one that replaced story and character with CGI. I just wish it would stop.SUMMARY: Too much of everything. Heroes, action, CGI. Just too much. I wasn't expecting King Lear, but this is more like King Drear.",6,3,8,23 August 2015
Big Fish," Big Fish? or Wet Fish?
","I really can't decide whether this is an Ok film that didn't quite push the right buttons, or just a plain non-event of a movie. It's rare that I find myself in this position. Usually I either hate or love a film, or find a movie not worth bothering with at all. But this one, whilst most certainly not impressing me at all, is neither bad enough for me to slate it, nor good enough for me to sing it's praises.Quite simply, I'm not sure what Burton was trying to do here. I understand all the metaphors and allegories that are present, but the ultimate goal of the film eludes me. Was it to make me think about how I relate to my father? Was it trying to tell me that not all stories are made up, or true? Was it simply trying to point out the difficulties of having a larger than life personality in a boring, mundane world? Is it all of the above? And, at the end, do we actually care?A film has to be entertaining on some level in order to keep the audience's attention. BF does this, but only just. At no point do you feel any great empathy for the character of the Father, as told in his stories. In fact, there's nothing about the film as a whole which really grasps your attention and demands that you continue watching.Perhaps the biggest failing, as with many other films, is the hype that surrounds them. BF has been hyped up as a wonderful movie that will astonish and delight. Unfortunately it doesn't deliver on that promise. In the end, it's just the story of a man coming to terms with his father's death and helping through that time and coming to understand himself better in the process. Throw in a few gentle fantasy elements and that's really all there is to Big Fish.Ultimately not so much of a Big Fish, as the One That Got Away....",5,2,5,20 April 2004
The Dark Knight," Overlong and yet not long enough...all at the same time
","And that comment is just the start of what is wrong with this movie. Given the incredible amount of hype that surrounded this movie because of Heath Ledger's death, it was inevitable that it would disappoint to some extent. But I was unprepared for just how badly it would disappoint me.Don't get me wrong, I love the franchise, and Batman Begins was a fantastic revitalisation of it. But TDK fails to live up to its predecessor for a number of reasons.Firstly, what the hell happened to Gotham City? Was there no budget for set design? Where is the Gothic architecture that was artfully blended into the modern in BB? All gone in favour of shiny modern buildings.Next, just how many subplots does a film need? TDK has loads. And each one is not fully realised, leaving you, as my summary suggests, both wishing for a longer, more rounded movie and at the same time wondering when it will end.The acting is pretty good, but it's not Oscar materiel. Heath Ledger makes a good Joker, but I'd hardly call it his best performance. Likewise, Bale seems content to just do his Batman thing and not give us any surprises. In short, nothing special.The effects are good, and there is action enough to keep you watching, but the subplots tend to break up the flow of it all and get in the way.The mobile phone 'sonar' network was ridiculously over the top in a movie franchise that was trying to be more 'realistic' and to be honest, that was the final nail in the coffin of this film.Likewise, when I look at the ratings this film has received, I guess I'm in the minority in not liking TDK. But that's alright. I guess not everyone has the ability to see past the hype and tabloid build-up and it is easy to get seduced by what they have been told is 'a great film'.To see this at number three on IMDb's list of top movies is just nerve-gratingly wrong. Let's just hope the next one will be better (and actually deserve to be labelled as such) SUMMARY: Too long and yet not long enough. A tedious plethora of subplots most of which are not necessary. Overall rather dull and tiresome.",2,2,7,23 September 2008
The Last Samurai," An oriental version of Gladiator, but better....
","Don't get me wrong, Galdiator is a great film. But this is better. The themes of honour, loyalty, redemption and responsibility are put forward with a force and certainty that I haven't seen for a long time in a film.<some spoilers ahead>The action pieces are well arranged and Cruise is convincing as a Samurai, albeit an American one. The rest of the cast are all excellentBut where this movie scores points (and for me elevated itself above the typical Hollywood nonsense we are used to) is in its subtlety. Two scenes stand out where, under a less caring scriptwriter or director, this film would have been a disappointment.The first is when Cruise's character is learning to swordfight. With Stat Hollywood Director (SHD) in control, you just know that there would come a point in the training where the student defeats the master, to looks of shock and surprise from all onlookers. Here, however, we are treated not to the besting of the master, but Cruise managing a draw against his teacher, to looks of shock and surprise from all onlookers. It might sound a trivial thing, but it made the movie that little bit more believable and enjoyable.The second scene involved the love interest between Algren (Cruise) and Taka. With jolly old SHD in charge, I would have expected the obligatory sex scene, followed by wailing and gnashing of teeth the following morning when he goes off to battle. Here however we are treated instead to a gentle admission (unspoken mostly) of their love for one another, with nothing more sexual than a simple kiss. Less subtle than the first example, perhaps, but no less telling.All in all this is a great film and, like Gladiator, one that I am sure will stand the test of time and be enjoyed again and again.",9,1,2,30 March 2004
Up," UP?....the first quarter hour brings you DOWN!
","As a projectionist, I frequently get to see the first ten minutes of most movies. You start the show, then hang around to make sure all is well with sound and vision before moving on to the next lace-up. Sometimes, those first few minutes stretch out a bit as the movie catches your interest.So it was with Up, but not in any kind of good way. The first 15 minutes or so depict the life of the Old Man from his childhood through to his current grumpy self. And what a life. Good God! A more calculated betrayal of viewer expectations I've never seen! At first, all is good. The kid plays, he meets a young girl, falls in love, gets married etc. All nice, charming stuff. But then the evil Pixar gremlins twist the knife ruthlessly. One mishap after another befalls the man and his wife. The car breaks, then the house is damaged in a storm. Then the wife discovers she can't have children (yes, I know...this is supposed to be a kids film, right?). Every mishap sets back the couple's plans to visit Angel Falls in Venezuela (a dream since they were both little). Finally, though, all seems well. The man (now old) finally goes and buys the tickets for the trip. He plans a nice picnic at their favourite spot to break the good news to his wife.Can you guess what happens? The evil Pixar goblins think that's too cheerful for kids. They instead have the wife partly collapse on the way, leading to a hospital scene (the second one of the intro) and, ultimately, the most depressing scene of all - the old man returning to his home alone, the wife having passed away.All this in the first fifteen minutes....I get that Pixar wanted to explain the back story of the old man so he wouldn't come across as grumpy and churlish. But all they actually did was to depress the Hell out of everyone watching.As this was aimed primarily at younger kids, I can't help but wonder about all the awkward questions and tears parents must have faced in those first twenty minutes.The rest of the film is technically excellent, but still rather dark and morose. Additionally, the complete and utter incompetence of the boy, Russell, leaves you wondering just how he managed to get all his other badges. Dogged persistence, I suspect.Anyway, the film isn't brilliant on a number of levels - competent, but not brilliant. But those opening minutes really taint the rest of the movie badly.As a rental I'd suggest vetting it yourself before showing it to the kids, particularly if they are sensitive. You'll end up answering a whole bunch of difficult questions if you don't.It's not a bad movie, as a whole, but has a rather unpleasant bite at the start which throws it in with the likes of Disney's Dinosaur and Bridge to Terabithia for unexpected shock value.EDIT: Just realised that 'Stupid, but funny, Fat Kid' appears to be an endemic trait in animated movies. Up, Monster House, Paranorman etc. they all have them now.",5,0,1,31 December 2009
National Treasure," National Education
","Now let's see....get a great cast of actors together, throw them into a treasure hunt scenario and you'd think you were on to a winner.But somehow NT fails to deliver. There are some good acting moments, great effects and sets. But the story gets bogged down with excessive and pointless exposition of American history. Likewise, after the first half hour the 'hunt' drags on from one clue to another interminably. I actually struggled to stay awake during this section of the movie and had to be prodded to stop me from snoring on more than one occasion.The film would seem better suited to getting kids interested in history than in being an action movie. Not that it is bad. Just that it doesn't really grab you and make you sit up and watch.It's a shame really. Would have been nice to see a successor to the Indiana Jones movies emerge. But this ain't so much Indiana Jones as Indiana Yawns.",6,0,1,28 June 2005
The Descent," The Descent....into plot (ahem...pot) holes
","Don't get me wrong, the movie is enjoyable enough. But it fell into that trap which more and more films do these days, of insulting your intelligence. Some might say that you shouldn't look too closely at such forms of entertainment, but at the same time, if you ignore the mistakes, then won't that just encourage film-makers to make even more shoddy films? But as to The Descent....first the Good: Believable cave sets. Unlike this years' other offering, The Cave, the sets here enhance the claustrophobic feel of being underground. There is lots of wriggling around and squeezing through tiny passages and the vast vaulted caverns are (for the most part) absent.The Bad: Call me old fashioned, but when I'm told 'These creatures evolved underground', I expect them to make use of more than just the sense of hearing. Sure, they may be blind, but does that mean they can't smell either? Or feel the heat of a burning torch when they are sat right next to it? Or, good God! Simply reach out and explore a suspected victims hidey-hole with their mits? The Ugly: The last fifteen minutes or so. Down to the final two survivors, one of whom has (entirely by accident) killed another party member and the other who (has found out about this killing, but not HOW it happened) and they both square off. Two against untold numbers of Gollum-wannabees. So what is the logical thing for them to do? Put aside their differences and work together to escape? Or maybe quickly fill each other in on what happened with regard to that killing, then scarper? No! The obvious thing to do is for Miss Self-Righteous to ice-pick the other girl in the leg and leave her for the Golllums to devour. Mmmm.....good cinema! And I won't go into the 'twist' at the end. Just switch off when blondie climbs out of the hole and pretend she lives happily ever after. God knows I hate Hollywood happy endings, but in this case it's preferable to the psycho-drivel that follows.Of course, you know the 'bad' girl had to die, because of unresolved issues from the very start of the film. It's not so much telegraphed as spammed in your face right from the off. And 'bad' girl tricks them all into thinking they are at another cave too...ooooh! bad! bad girl! Strange then that, by the end, I was rather hoping she'd survive and not the other one. Oh well! So much for wishes.Comparison to The Cave: The Cave - schlocky monster movie that knows what it is. The Descent - tries to be 'real' and 'gritty' but lets itself down with inexplicable plot-turns and nonsense.Summary: Cave scenes - good, cast - reasonable, monsters - not too bad, plot - foolish, ending - diarrhea.",7,1,3,13 November 2005
Titanic," Excellent, epic drama
","There is no doubt that James Cameron is capable of putting out fantastic cinema. The man just seems to have a feel for what will pull on the emotions and his eye for scene setting has no equal. Some spoilers ahead.I recently re-watched this on video, on a small TV, and it still blew me away. Action fans will, of course, be disappointed. Perhaps this even qualifies as a chick-flick. I don't know, and don't care. It's just a great movie and never drags even at over three hours.I've tried hard to find niggles, to be impartial, but the only things I can point to are a couple of instances where the special effects were bad (at the beginning, where the bow of the sunken Titanic looks exactly like what it is....a model) and later where Jack and Rose are on the the foredeck and the camera is looking back toward the superstructure (where the scenery looks like the backdrop from a school play). Other than these, the story and effects are fantastic and enhance the film rather than overpowering it.I always cry at the end, with the old lady's scenes of returning to the ship. This is one of a very few movies that do make me cry. For that reason it will always be a favourite.",10,12,19,28 June 2003
The Happening," An M Night movie that sucks........What a Tweest!
","Y'know, when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was actually quite excited. Apocalyptic (and post-apocalyptic) movies are one of my favourite genres. It all looked so good in the trailer....right up until the moment the trailer revealed that it was 'An M Night Shyamalan film'. They might have well announced the movie to be a SciFi Channel spectacular. The impact could have hardly filled me with more dread.Shyamalan has to date produced two good movies, one OK movie and, now, three stinkers. The balance of his work has passed the tipping point now and, barring some miracle, I can't see him clawing his way back from this.The Happening is primarily composed of a small band of 'survivors' roaming the countryside wondering whats happening and why people are killing themselves. Eventually they twig (sorry 'bout that pun) that it's the very plants themselves that are trying to kill them by releasing a nerve agent into the atmosphere. Of course. this is all very telegraphed from the start (it is a Shyamalan movie, after all) and rather anti-climactic when revealed. Anyway, the survivors wander about, wondering about what to do and uttering such priceless lines of dialogue that it's hard not to burst out laughing at times. In fact, many members of the audience I saw it with were unable to contain themselves and chortled through much of it. At least they were having a good time! Of course, seeing someone kill themselves on screen is not meant to be funny. And the first few times, it isn't. But as time goes by, the script calls for suicides in increasingly bizarre and preposterous ways, leading you to wonder whether someone in the projection booth might possibly have spliced in a few feet of a Monty Python movie as a joke.Of course, the joke is on those who've paid to see this (I'm lucky enough to work in a cinema, so I get in free). I would be sorely tempted to ask for my money back if I had paid for this.Plot-wise it's a basic 'We hurt nature, now nature is getting revenge' deal. But the reality of plants evolving a neurotoxin capable of killing off humanity is woefully optimistic. I'm not saying it couldn't happen, but to happen as portrayed in The Happening is nonsense.Given the above, it's hard to make a suspenseful film whereby the main menace is a tree waving in the wind. Nevertheless, The Happening tries to do this and we are treated to any number of scenes of wind-blown plant life interspersed with the characters looking frightened. And when a character looks frightened at an innocuous object/item, its really hard not to snicker.The acting is, for the most part, unbearably bad. Given the awful, discordant dialogue clangers that they have to drop during the film, it would be hard for even a veteran actor to summon any shred of stage-presence here. Mostly they just muddle through and then wander around some more. However, no one is going to win any awards for their roles here, and rightly so. Close-ups of Wahlberg looking, frankly, like an early-onset Alzheimer's sufferer, do nothing but move the audience to mirth. One highly amusing acting point to note is Zooey Deschanel's incredible ability to act out most scenes as if she's pretending to be a Tarsier (google it and examine the resulting images, you'll see what I mean). Her bug-eyed staring is truly amazing and rather startling at first, then becomes merely amusing.And that, sadly, is pretty much a good way to sum up this film. People wandering about, looking confused and wondering what the hell is going on. It's not gripping and it's not frightening. It's bizarre and ridiculous and will probably win an award for the funniest unfunny movie of 2008.Not so much The Happening. More like The Not Much Happening. Imagine Day of the Triffids but without the Triffids and you'll get an idea how dull this movie is. It makes even the likes of Lady in the Water look like a frickin' Shakespearean masterpiece.Seriously, avoid this one.",1,7,15,26 June 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Rehashed
","Here we go again....a hyped-up movie can only do one thing....disappoint. Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty good film, but nowhere near as good as I had hoped. And nothing near as good as the first one. There are some minor spoilers ahead.I think the problem lies partly with the effects, which we've all seen in countless films since the original Matrix was released. In the original, it was all new and added to the Wow! factor. Here, it's all been seen before, so does little to add to the magic.The other problem, which I wondered about from the moment I heard they were doing a sequel, was what they did with Neo. At the end of the first movie he effectively became a god of the Matrix. A kind of Q-like figure able to do virtually (no pun intended, honest!) anything he liked. How do you make a story about an omnipotent being and not have it dissolve into a 'Neo waves his hand and the Agents die' type of thing? The answer here was to shift much of the action out of the Matrix and into reality, such as it is.The plot, contrary to the opinions of many, was not unecessarily complex and was easy enough to follow. In fact the characters did a little TOO much exposition, no doubt for the hard-of-understanding amongst us. That said, there are questions left unanswered and no doubt all will be made clear in the final installment at the end of the year.I saw a documentary about the making of TMR in which they stated that TMR was 'action-carnage, action-carnage' all the way through. Not true. There are overlong scenes which have you shifting uncomfortably in your seat, thinking 'when are we going to get back to the action, or even the plot?' One such scene is the relatively pointless 'rave' scene. Yes, I guess it's there to show us how wonderful humanity is and how we can't let it fall to the machines etc. but it's a real Duracell moment - it just keeps going and going and going. And the sex scene with Neo and Trinity? Could it be that they are desperately in love with one another? OK, I get that, can we please move on now?I also have to say that some of the fight sequences went on a little too long also. Morpheus on top of the 18-wheeler, for instance. OK, I accept that the Agents have been upgraded since last time and Morpheus is having a hard time dealing with one, but really, how many times do we need to see Morpheus almost get knocked off the truck before we understand that?The fight scene with Neo and the legions of Agent Smiths was enjoyably silly, but the bowling ball knocking down pins noise that appeared at one point was a foolish addition that ruined it somewhat.Good points: The car chase was pretty neat, though someone ought to point out to the effects editors that it isn't enough to merely edit out the wooden logs that get shot out of a steam cannon under the car in order to make cars flip and roll, but they should edit out the residual steam too. But one of the best car chases I've seen nonetheless.Overall I'm a little disappointed with this movie, as you may have guessed. Rarely are sequels as good as the original, and this is no exception to that. This isn't a bad movie by any means, but not a patch on the original. Or to put it in perspective, I have the original on DVD, but I doubt very much if this one will be joining it.",8,1,2,22 May 2003
The Fountain," If your movie is so obscure as to alienate viewers, you've failed as a director.
","The Fountain. Ninety minutes of overly pretentious, pompous nonsense that tries to convince you it is art. Well, it sure does look very nicely filmed and many scenes are very artistic.Sadly, that is where it also fails the hardest. It's as if so much attention was paid to trying to make it look good that they failed to really do much of anything with such movie staples as plot, script, dialogue etc.Yes, I know. It IS supposed to be an art piece. But that's the problem. Some movies can be art, but not all art can be a movie. In this case, this is a clear instance of the latter, rather than the former.The Fountain comes across as directionless and shallow fairly early on. It isn't really anything like so poor, but by the time you are supposed to be thinking hard about what is going on, you've already switched off. Almost nothing is explained with any clarity and, in fact, the whole thing comes across as a self-indulgent mess.Only the current day section is real, which is what most people miss. The rest are flights of fancy by either Izzy or Tommy. However, this isn't immediately apparent from the movie. I understand that the budget was slashed in half, which can't have done it any favors. A little bit more kindness in the cutting room might have made things a little more obvious, but that isn't what happened. As a result, the entire movie feels disjointed and rushed.My problem with the film stems entirely from the poor way it is presented to audiences. Most people should simply not watch a movie like this, but, obviously, that does not rake in the dollars for the studios. So the movie was mis-represented prior to release to make it seem appealing to a wider audience. It doesn't, and never will have, mass market appeal.Does it appeal to me? Not really. I like movies that make you think. Here, however, even I met my limit. It just tries too hard and gives very little back to its audience for their efforts.At the box office, it failed even with a budget cut. $35 million to produce and only $16 million in worldwide receipts. How this one slipped through test-screening results is anyone's guess, but Aranofsky got away without it damaging his career too badly. I guess Black Swan redeemed him in the eyes of the studios, too, since it had such a massive profit margin. However, I hope he learned something from this film's failure.SUMMARY: Overblown nonsense, too cerebral for most audiences, art masquerading as a film when, in fact, it should have been a film all along. Really a movie for those who want to name drop to make themselves look clever.",4,3,6,16 January 2013
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Terrible brainless drivel about two expressionless idiots.
","I suspect I'm the only one who found this movie unintentionally offensive due to the nature of it's two stars and certain off-set antics between them leading to the demise of Mr Pitt's relationship with a certain Ms. Aniston. That Pitt's first movie since the 'breakup' would be about a couple who don't know what each other get up to behind their partner's backs is one of those dreadfully ironic twists of fate that could only occur in Hollywood.So it was that I was predisposed to dislike both Pitt and Jolie in this film. Luckily, they both have such mahogany-like acting abilities that I don't need to use the aforementioned dislike as an excuse to slate the movie. They are so unbelievable in the roles of husband and wife that it is physically painful to watch them on-screen. I have yet to see 'Gigli' which is reputed to have even less chemistry between its stars, but I can't see how it could get much worse than this.As for the plot......sheeesh! Two rival hit agencies don't apparently know that their respective top agents are married to each other? Good grief it's just lamentably awful. We won't go into the rest of the 'plot'. Suffice to say that this film is suitable for IQ's below 100 and let's leave it there.Not much depth, some action, no plot, actors that need a good wood stain to bring out their grain.Not recommended.",5,1,2,5 September 2005
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transformers....Michael Bay should be shot....
","You the worst thing about this movie is not that I sat through all 2.5 hours of it. It's that I fell asleep about an hour in, only to wake up a little later and find there was STILL another hour to go! Michael Bay...seriously...are you eight years old? This entire film is like watching a child play with his toys. There's no plot worth a damn, just a succession of explosions and running about. Very little makes any kind of sense at all. The transformers seem to be anthropomorphised into horrible clichéd stereotypes of American culture.But realistically, I can't really blame Micky B for this debacle. We (by which I mean the rest of you, of course) told him how great the first movie was and, like a praised Labrador, he got all excitable and started jumping up and barking until he finally yacked up the ball of vomit that is Transformers 2.Tedious would be an understatement to describe this film. Mr Bay appears to have forgotten (if he ever knew) that a good film is character-driven, not action driven. If you don't care about the characters, what is the point of watching the film in the first place? Ooooh! Look at the pretty pictures.....Aaaaaah! an explosion! Then later.....what's going on? God help us all when Transformers 3 gets here. Though it's hard to see how even Bay can out-Bay himself next time. I prophesy, however, more mind-numbing repetitive action and explosion sequences. Oh, and even more annoying Gremlin rip-off bots.Unless your 10 or under, or have a sub-standard IQ, best avoid this direly insulting movie.",4,1,6,21 November 2009
Zero Dark Thirty," The slow pace of the film kills any chance it has of being watched again.
","To be honest, I found it reasonably interesting, but that was coming from knowing the film is based on real events. If you made a fictional story about a manhunt in the same way that this movie was done, it would get slaughtered by the critics. The reality of the story gives it a certain gravitas which the film-making entirely tries to ruin.We all get how long and drawn out a process it was to track down Bin Laden. But quite why they needed to show this in such a tedious manner is beyond me. Imagine if Titanic had been two hours of showing the process of building the ship then twenty minutes of it sinking. That's essentially what you get with ZDT. A lot of relatively dull spy drama followed by a twenty minute action sequence.As to how accurate the events of the movie are in relation to actual events, I have no idea. But there was one scene, where a supposed Al-Qaeda traitor goes to a meeting at an airbase and is allowed to drive right up, inside the base, to the building where the meeting is. Whilst I was watching it, I couldn't believe that ever happened. Surely the better option was to have him transfer from his vehicle at the main gate to one of the base vehicles? Not to let him drive his car bomb right inside! If that really happened.... Jesus Christ! Words fail me! I just hope it was idiocy on the part of the film-makers.Anyway, as I say, a lot of tedious spy drama. Not a lot of action. I'm not sure film was the best medium to tell this story with. You can't condense a ten-plus year manhunt down into two hours and make it remotely interesting. There is little along the way to break the monotony of watching people play Scooby Doo with the clues. Especially when the reason most people will watch the film is to see the events that took place inside Bin Laden's compound.I know, the film was primarily about the 'hunt' for Bin Laden, not the final minutes of it, but really, most of the movie was about as much fun as watching someone else play Scrabble.In short, not terribly entertaining and not particularly enlightening. I doubt anyone will be interested in watching it more than once.Oh, and by the way, there is a very small cameo by John Barrowman at one point. I actually like him a lot, but his presence here, much like it does in the TV show, Arrow, completely destroys any sense of tension and menace. Here, he was barely on screen for thirty seconds, but that was more than enough. Fair actor, but he just tends to make you not take what you're watching seriously and in a movie such as this, he was a bad casting choice.SUMMARY: A bit dull really which, considering the subject matter, is not what I was expecting.",6,5,10,2 March 2013
War of the Worlds," Whoooosh! With our de-clothing ray!
","See, the problem with films these days is too much of a good thing. Too much CGI, too much violence and, in this case, too much sickly sweet goody-goodness for its, errr own good.It started off weakly, with Morgan Freeman's rendition of the now famous opening narration. Morgan Freeman is a great actor, don't get me wrong, but he sounded bored whilst reading this. Hardly the commanding voice of Richard Burton.Dakota Fanning.... Not since Ernie Reyes Jr in Conan the Destroyer have I wanted to see a child torn limb from limb so badly. All she does is scream and dispense child-prodigy pearls of wisdom between breaths. Then she screams some more. All this, and losing the use of her legs constantly so that Daddy Cruise has to lug her around like a suitcase, left me beyond irritated with her. In fact, my partner remarked that the movie should be retitled 'Carry the Daughter'.The son was equally annoying, but made bearable because you actually thought he might have died at one point. How naive of me to assume that any central character might die in a Spielberg production. Magically he teleports from the jaws of certain death to happy safety in Boston. Or so it seems.The movie, for all its technical prowess, is woeful in many departments. Spielberg seemed to be attempting to 'do a Titanic', in that he set a drama against the backdrop of a tragedy, which was almost incidental to the film. Cameron got it right in Titanic. Spielberg doesn't here. The unfolding family drama is just downright aggravating and just gets in the way.The plot is just so full of holes that it is embarrassing and insulting to think such a cinematic giant as Spielberg couldn't have even bothered attempting to patch them up. Are we really to swallow that aliens as curious and active as these ones are portrayed can plan a million years ahead? That they would plant machines on our world that long ago 'just in case' or as some kind of 'lay away' plan? C'mon! The whole thing is so woolly. I mean, woolly story, woolly physics, so much wool that you could knit an entire cardigan whilst watching it! But, on the plus side I learned these unassailable truths from watching this production: 1. Aliens can hide thousands upon thousands of death machines beneath the Earth's surface which, over the course of a million years, are not once damaged or unearthed by seismic activity.2. Alien weaponry can silently vaporise people but mysteriously leave their clothing unharmed.3. Aliens are smart enough to make their death machines waterproof but don't think to include an air filtration unit as basic equipment.4. Electromagnetic Pulses (EMP) will knock out all electrical and electronic equipment and devices, unless said devices are integral to the laughable plot.5. A jet passenger liner can crash on your house but you will be unharmed if you stay in the basement. What's more, your car will also suffer no ill effects, even though your house and neighbourhood are completely demolished and a convenient, rubble-free path will allow you to drive away afterwards.6. Newspaper people will scavenge amongst the dead for provisions after even as short a time as one day without food or water.7. Alien death machines get sick just like their occupants, losing the ability to stand motionless or even operate their defensive shields, thus allowing hapless humans to take them out with simple anti-tank weaponry.8. After sending machines to Earth millennia ago, the aliens are happy to use these million year old relics again, apparently not having developed their technology any further in the intervening epochs.9. When planning a sight-seeing trip to an abandoned farmstead, aliens will never bother to put on any kind of protective suit, instead relying on their natural immunity to protect them from any bugs.If I seem flippant with the above, well....it's the only way I can find to get across the scorn with which I regard this movie. A great opportunity was wasted here. The 1953 version still stands as the undisputed champion of these movies. But, if you must watch an alien invasion movie, rent Independence Day. At least that had no pretensions about what it was. This is just painful.And to think, Spielberg was worried that Cruise's off-screen antics might negatively affect the movie's revenue. Frankly, the movie would have been a whole lot more entertaining if Tombo had saved the day with a bottle of vitamins. At least we could all have had a good laugh then.",6,0,1,30 August 2005
30 Days of Night," 90 Minutes of wtf?......
","Ho-hum. Given the basic storyline I was hoping for much more from this movie. Sadly it was not to be. Instead, we get pretty much every horror and vampire cliché you might care to think of. By themselves, clichés aren't terrible, but the rest of the movie is so annoying and painful to watch at times that the sum (of its bad parts) outweighs the whole quite completely.Of particular annoyance was the lack of anything remotely looking like intelligence on the part of either the vampires or their victims. People do stupid things solely so they can be killed in an 'entertaining' way by one vampire or another.And as for the vampires.... Comical is the best way to describe them. They have all the menace of Halloween trick-or-treaters and the dress-sense of an eighties techno-rock band. Add in their kill-kill-kill-we-can't-do-anything-but-kill mentality and they are just the worst kind of farcical parody on the vampire legend that there could be. Plus the apparent lack of being able to do something as simple as wiping the blood from their faces (even after its supposedly been there for the whole month) just turns them into a big joke.Picture this: You're the leader of a gang of vampires (about thirty or so I reckon) and you've plotted to sail up in the good ship SS Fangster just as a town goes into a sunless period for a month. So....you've got thirty days to desport yourself among the cattle that are the 150 human occupants. So what do you do? You effectively cut off all communications with the outside world.....check! Then you go into the town with your mob and slaughter 95% of the inhabitants on the first night......wait, what? This is what you are dealing with. There is no common sense here. The vampires act idiotically. And after killing most of the inhabitants, and knowing that there are others hiding, what do they do? Instigate a house to house search? Check every conceivable hideaway? No....they simply do very little until one of the humans does something almost as idiotic and draws attention to itself. Then they all rush to the attack mob-handed with their still bloody faces. Christ, even animals clean themselves.In short, the plot is pretty dumb. There is also no suspense as a result and little in the way of character development.The film editing also leaves MUCH to be desired. Scenes shift with such alarming rapidity that a bathroom break can (quite literally) mean missing a whole week's worth of the 30 days of the title.Also, having cut the power to the town, one might imagine more being made of the fact that it's a tad chilly outside. I saw frosty breath (real or CGI'd) only once near the start of the film. And what do the characters do for heat whilst hiding away in the now unheated buildings? All of these things combine to ruin what could have been a good movie. On the plus side, Josh Hartnett's character dies at the end in quite a noble way (if a bit ridiculous) and there was a nice scene with a vampire child going nuts.Other than that, the movie is an assault on the intellect that really adds nothing to the vampire genre that hasn't already been done, and better, by many other movies. Only the setting distinguishes this film from any other vampire movie and that was woefully underused.SUMMARY: Plot: Fair. Acting: OK. Stupidity: Off the scale CONCLUSION: If you want to see a horror/monster movie in a frozen setting buy the Thing on DVD.",6,1,2,9 January 2008
Edge of Tomorrow," Fine, fun movie, but with a bad, 'focus group' ending that almost ruins it.
","So, Tom Cruise seems to have a thing for scifi movies these days and, I have to say, for the most part they are pretty good.Edge of Tomorrow (EoT), is another such film. Plenty of action and time travel malarkey and an alien invasion smack in the middle of it. Cruise does action rather well and there is plenty of opportunity here, I'm sure, for him to do a lot of his own stunts.But what do you get for your money? Well, imagine D-Day meets Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day and you'll have a good idea of what to expect. Cruise is the soldier seemingly cursed to repeat the same day over and over. The difference here is that the day resets when he dies, not when he goes to sleep. And he dies a lot, of course. In the process, learning everything about his fellow soldiers and the aliens and how, in fact, to not get killed.The action set-pieces are well done and there is some originality in them. But essentially, it is one action scene after another, as Cruise tries to find a way to turn the tide of the war against the aliens.The aliens, as others have observed, bear similarities with the sentinels from the Matrix. However, any indignation at this pseudo-plagiarism quickly vanishes as the action mounts.Turns out, the aliens can control time, or rather, their leader can. But, in a twist purely designed to set up the premise of the whole movie, that power can be stolen from them by simply killing an 'alpha', which are aliens connected to the main controlling brain of the invasion. Yeah, I know, it's hokey and it doesn't make sense whatsoever.So, derivative story, derivative aliens and an alien weakness designed by whoever came up with the aliens in After Earth. So it must be rubbish, right? Actually no. EoT is a fine, fun military scifi adventure that holds together despite its flaws. However, all the fun, action and enjoyment comes perilously close to being ruined by the dumb ending.See, time travel has a set of rules. Anyone that has watched any amount of scifi knows them well. If you go back in time, you can change the future. This is what Cruise's character Cage is trying to do. Going back to the beginning of the same day in order to find a way to defeat the aliens instead of them defeating us.But, at the end of the movie, Cage gets to go back once more, after defeating the alien menace. Except, that when he wakes up at that first day, the aliens are still defeated. Wait, that bit hasn't happened yet... so what the movie is trying to sell us is that by changing the future you can change the past...I'm sorry, but that is just bullshit right there and I can tell you exactly how it came about.Presumably the ending was deemed to dark if both Tom and his lady-friend soldier get killed at the end. So some morons in a focus group somewhere suggested to the studio that they make the ending happier and more heroic (as if self-sacrifice isn't the noblest thing in the world). So a new ending was shot in which everything turned out fine in the end.Let me make it clear, I don't dislike the ending because it is happy. I dislike it because it is crappy! Whilst this ending will never come close to being disappointing in the way that say... Blake's 7, or Mass Effect 3, was, it nonetheless made me scowl and glare at the screen.After adhering to its own rules for the whole film, the ending gleefully throws them away so that idiots with no brain stem can walk out of the movie with a stupid smile on their faces. Unfortunately, those who do possess a nervous system are left feeling cheated and saddened by this sudden, but by no means inevitable, betrayal.Now, I said the ending almost ruins it and it does. Only the general level of fun and mayhem up to that point saves it. That, and my fervent hope that, much like I Am Legend (which suffered a similar ending for stupid people), there will be an alternative ending cut made available on Bluray/DVD. Perhaps something darker and more noble, or perhaps something that has just been thought out more and not hacked on at the behest of a test audience of popcorn munching primates. That is my hope for this movie.PLOTHOLE EDIT: So, the alien brain has the power to reset time IF one of the alpha's is killed. So why then, does it not keep an alpha close to hand and have the minor aliens kill it if it is threatened by assassin's such as Tombo and Blondie? Instant reset and then it sets an ambush for them. Without the blood in their veins, they won't remember they've been there before and would repeat everything, allowing brain to kill them handily.SUMMARY: Good scifi action movie made a little sour by the dumb ending, but worth watching nonetheless. Hopefully there'll be an alternate ending on Bluray.",8,1,3,12 July 2014
Army of Darkness," Magnificent!
","What can you say? Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell just work brilliantly together. This film is just magnificent and the best of the series to date.Sam Raimi has become more noticed lately due to Spiderman and deservedly so. He seems to have a talent for comedy films and I hope he continues to do more of these.Bruce Campbell is a much underrated actor who has a wonderful comic talent that deserves more recognition. He consistently hams it up as Ash, the non-too-bright hero who manages to muddle through despite being his own worst enemy.There are so many wonderfully silly scenes that to list them all would be to spoil the film. Let's just say I never tire of watching this movie and it will remain one of my all-time favourites. If you like comedy-horror then this film is for you.",10,2,3,17 December 2002
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Run away! Run as fast as you can!
","First off, I was told this was one of Will Ferrel's better movies. If so, all I can wonder is, how does he keep getting parts? Everyone (and I really mean everyone) in this film is funnier than he is. He's like that annoying guy who shows up at parties and repeatedly tells boring anecdotes that everyone else smiles politely at whilst secretly wishing he'd go away.The first 45 minutes are sheer torture...non-funny gags that rely almost entirely on a stereotypical 70's male vs. female routine that gets old so fast it's almost frightening. In fact, the movie has something of a split-personality. the first half is where they try to be funny using words and simple gags. It fails pretty abysmally. The last half things seem to go a bit whacko....fights to the death among news-crews, severed limbs, feces eating....you get the idea. It's almost as if the crew realised it wasn't funny and grew increasingly desperate to salvage something from the movie.Every cameo role that turns up in this movie - and there are lots - steals any scene that they are in. In fact, it's only the procession of well-known faces that keeps the interest, if only to see how utterly they bury Ferrel's supposed comic genius.Ironically, it's only the desperation of the second half of the film that saves it in any way at all. You watch only to see how bad it will get - and trust me it gets pretty awful - before the end.I'm still utterly amazed by how completely devoid of comic talent Wil Ferrel can be, but I'm sure that won't stop him from making more dire pieces of celluloid garbage in the future.Recommended viewing only for prisoners undergoing psychological torture.",5,15,30,3 September 2006
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," 'It feels thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.'
","Bilbo's own words from The Lord of the Rings ring true when it comes to this movie, sadly.My feelings for the final installment of The Hobbit can be summed up by imagining the following discussion around the script-writing table...'So, we have Legolas fighting 'Next-most-important-Orc (tm)' at the end and the bridge crumbles, and so we get Legolas to run up the falling masonry to safety? Anyone?''Wow! That sounds so cool. Let's do it!'There you have it. That one scene sums up everything wrong with the movie. That they thought it was a good idea is forgivable. That they went ahead and included it in the final film after seeing how bad it looked is just as ludicrous as watching it unfold on the screen in front of you. The stones fall in seeming slow motion yet provide a firm footing for the lighter-than-air Legolas as he hops up them.It is, by no means, the only awful example of CGI in the movie, but it is the most jarring.I complained that, in the first movie, the dwarfs were essentially interchangeable and generic. That changed considerably in the second film, to my pleasure, but Oh dear! In this installment, the dwarfs get almost no character time at all with the exception of Thorin and Kili. Some of them don't even get lines to say!It is a movie too far, frankly. Padded out with unnecessary CGI battles that serve little purpose. There are weird worm monsters that the orcs seek out like they are going to be the battle-winner for them, which then get five seconds of screen time before vanishing into the ground never to be seen again. They don't even contribute to the battle at all, for goodness' sake!I didn't expect the gravity and seriousness of Lord of the Rings, but neither did I expect the buffoonery of Alfrid in this movie, or the dwarfs in the first film. I did expect the movie to be competently done but, to be honest, I doubt Jackson had that much to do as a director. Most of the movie is CGI battle scenes or choreographed fights. The few moments of character drama are few and far between here.Another annoyance was just how heavy-handed Jackson was in connecting this film (and the previous two) with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. A crazy fight scene with the Nazgul vs. Galadriel, Saruman and Elrond in Dol Guldur? Really? It's not like they even tried to be subtle about it. It's more like a hammer to the face saying 'Look! It's Sauron! He's behind it all! There he is! See his Eye!' Honestly, even M Night couldn't manage this level of obvious, in-the-face, spamming.As a theatrical release, I suppose it serves the popcorn brigade well enough, but as an addition to the Tolkien movie roster, it is weak. I can only hope the inevitable extended edition fills in the gaps and makes it a more rounded movie, because as it is, it is seriously square! In fact, there are a number of scenes currently in the theatrical release that I would not miss if they magically vanished in the extended cut. But then, I guess they'd have to call it the reduced cut and that would never sell!SUMMARY: Weak last installment. Jackson suffers from the Lucas Syndrome when it comes to making prequels. The only good thing that can really be said about it is that, in the future, people will watch this trilogy before the LOTR and be amazed at how much better the latter is.",6,3,8,7 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Look Ma! It's full of those new-fangled special effects!
","And that, sadly, really does sum up the third, and last of the star wars sextet. It's rare that I'll say you can have too many special effects, but here, I'm afraid it's true. I pity the day when effects companies like ILM manage to do away entirely with the need for actors, because then we'll just get more movies like this, but without even the bad acting to look at.ROTS is a mess, really. Partly this comes from hammy dialogue and scenes, and partly it comes from being a prisoner of its own 'tie-up the loose ends' storyline. But mostly it comes from trying to cram a plot that should have been started from Episode 1 into this, the last film.Everything feels rushed, from the dialogue and scenes, to the risible acting portrayed in places. Not that the actors have to do much acting, since all they ever seem to do is run around and fight a lot, but the rare instances of character interaction are painful in many cases.Poor Hayden Christensen! He tries very hard to portray the fall from grace of Anakin and his descent into darkness. But, hampered by the need to do this over the space of only a couple of scenes, there really wasn't much he could do with the part. And the way in which he turns to the dark side? Let's just say that Mark Hamill's portrayal in ROTJ was much more believable and leave it at that.Also, when Anakin discovers his good buddy Palpatine is a Sith Lord, to say the reaction is half-hearted is doing it a great favour. Imagine your reaction to being told (by the person themselves, whom you came to trust) that they were something like a Nazi death-camp guard who was in charge of the gas supply. Pretty awful, huh? Yet despite this equivalent revelation, and the fact that his real buddies the Jedi had not done him any real harm, you'll understand why Anakin's turning to the dark side is, shall we say, less than believable. Truly Anakin must be the dimmest Jedi around.And the final battle between Anakin/Darth and Obi-Wan? Well, quite frankly I don't know why they spent so much time on the sword-fighting routines. For a start, by the time you get to see it, you've overloaded on lightsabre action from the numerous other fight scenes by then. And then there's the fact that, thanks to the flashing blades you don't really see much of the skill involved anyhow. And as for the ludicrous places on the lava planet that they enact the fight, it doesn't really grip you as it should.The one, and only, scene where I actually got a chill run down my spine? The scene where Darth Vader's helmet is put on for the first time. There's a pause, then the familiar Darth breathing sound begins. That was good.Tying up the loose ends was an obvious task for this film, but many of them are done poorly, such as the business with the droids. Plus, what is NOT explained is how R2-D2 ends up the robotic equivalent of a pensioner in Ep. 4+. In this film not only does he leap about like a demented flea, but he's got more gadgets than James Bond. What happens to all of that by the time Ep 4 comes around? And what was the purpose of showing Chewbacca? Just a cave-in to the fans' demands? The only purpose it served is to show that Yoda and Chewie knew each other. A fact that is irrelevant in the following films.But the rest? One mind-numbing fight scene after the next. And more effects than you can shake a lightsabre at.I think its good that Lucas has decided to finish the franchise with this movie. The more he does, the worse they seem to get. Let's call it quits here whilst we can still grit our teeth and enjoy them.",6,2,5,21 May 2005
Lord of War," Unusual and refreshing change from the normal film dross
","Lord of War is an unusual movie in that it features an anti-hero. Someone who is not perfect, has questionable moral values and is quite happy to get ahead at the expense of his fellow man.Cage plays Yuri Orlov, an immigrant who, bored of his small-town existence, decides to pursue a career as a gun-runner as a means of getting out of his otherwise dull lifestyle. What's more, he finds he is rather good at it and so begins the tale of his adventures on the shadier shade of life.Orlvo is an inherently unlikeable man. He trafficks in guns, no doubt causing the deaths (indirectly) of countless thousands of people. He smokes, does drugs, marries a girl primarily because of an infatuation (not love), uses his brother whenever it suits him and is generally full of unpleasant moral leanings. In short, he should be a character we could care less about and, in fact, might hope to be brought to justice.Yet, in spite of this and thanks in great measure to clever writing and Cage's performance, Orlov grows on you very quickly. You find yourself watching his antics (narrated by Cage himself throughout the movie) with amusement and even, in some ways, admiration.Of course, if this were a typical Hollywood movie, you might expect that, in the end, Orlov's empire would come crashing down around his ears and he would end up in jail. But this is not a typical movie.Instead, the final revelation of the film is one that, perhaps, we all know deep down. That, behind every bad man is another man, one step removed from the dirty-hands of the man below him and wielding more power. And behind him yet another, and so on, all the way to the top of the power tree. In short, the movie tells us that power is corrupt and that, no matter how good your intentions, there is always someone more powerful than you who is not so scrupulous.Of course, Cage's character does lose much in the course of his career - wife, family, brother etc. But in the end, thanks to 'the man above him' he walks free.If there is anything wrong with this movie, it is the rather depressing thought that, no matter how good you are and no matter what you do to try and make the world a better place, there are always at least two people doing the opposite and, unlike you, they aren't hampered by questions of ethics and morals. Whilst perhaps portraying the world in a more realistic light than most movies, this is nonetheless a terribly depressing notion that, far from enhancing the film, actually drags it down somewhat.However, the movie is fresh and interesting for the most part and a welcome change from the usual Hollywood shiny, happy people movies that we are so often plagued with. A few more like this won't go amiss.",7,1,4,7 January 2006
Prometheus," It's official....scientists of the future are stupid!
","I had high hopes for this movie. Ridley Scott, Alien, yada yada. It all seemed so promising. Perhaps the highlight of the scifi movie calender this year.Oh well, more hopes dashed.First, the good things. The cinematography, acting, special effects and everything to do with the film-making process are all better than average or excellent.The writing, however, is entirely another matter. Those who have read even a few of my reviews know I hate one thing above all else. Insulting the intelligence of the audience.Prometheus, sadly, does this again and again.Having been sent off into space on an expedition (which most of the crew and scientists don't even know the purpose of - how did they sell that to them? Sign on for this expedition without knowing what you're getting into!) our heroes are briefed on arrival in a scene that was almost a copy of the marines briefing from Aliens, right down to the barracking and disbelief of the listeners.I don't know about you, but being told I might find the creators of our own species would get me excited, not lead to pour scorn on the speaker. But anyway, our scientist heroes duly land on the planet and find an alien structure. On going in and finding the air breathable, the first thing a supposed intelligent scientist does (on an alien world, remember.) is take their helmet off. FAIL!After having mapped the majority of the structure remotely, two scientists then get lost on their way back to the ship and never once think to ask for directions, or call out for assistance, even though their comms devices are working just fine. EPIC FAIL!Later on these two discover a small alien creature. Their first reaction. To go up and prod at it with their hands. DARWIN AWARD FAIL! You see where I'm going with this? All of the above takes place within forty minutes or so. And it doesn't get much better for the rest of the film.Remember, these aren't clueless freighter jocks as in Alien. They aren't dumb grunts as in Aliens. They aren't dumb-enough-to-get-caught criminals as in Alien 3 and they aren't gung-ho pseudo-mercs as in Alien Resurrection. They are supposed to be intelligent scientists.I'm not saying the writing is bad. I'm saying it is pitiful! It's like when you watch a horror movie of the slasher variety. You know the characters are going to do dumb-ass stuff like this. But you don't expect it in a scifi movie to this extent. Especially not one helmed by Ridley Scott.It's a shame, because everything else about the film is beautifully done. But the writing is inept and insulting, forcing characters to do ridiculous actions for the sake of the plot. Here's an idea Damon Lindelof.... how about you write the plot around the actions of the characters, and not the other way around! Thanks for taking a somewhat off-the-wall franchise and tarring it mercilessly with the Hollywood action-blockbuster brush of sloppiness! As far as the franchise goes, I'd actually rate this below both Alien 3 AND AVP, though not below AVP2, which remains the shitty mud at the bottom of the celluloid rain-barrel.In short then, a wasted opportunity ruined by abysmal writing and characterization. Watch it for the pretties and try REALLY hard not to think about it too much.",7,95,151,4 June 2012
Taken 2," Taken 2 far
","I was kind of looking forward to this. I thoroughly enjoyed the first Taken movie and hoped for a repeat of the action and tension in this film. Sadly, it was not to be.There are a number of problems with the film, not the least of which is that it isn't really tense at all. Not in the slightest. There is action and shooting and fighting, but none of it has any real bite to it at all.Next there are the ridiculous plot devices that mar the movie. Barricades in front of an embassy are not set so that you can drive straight between them. Istanbul is painted as a 'Mos Eisley' style den of lawlessness where you can shoot guns and set off grenades without repercussions.My favvorite, though, is the physics abuse moment. Most films have them, but this one is a classic. In it, Neeson's character has his daughter set off a grenade whilst he is talking to her on a mobile phone. He hears the explosion on the phone, then starts counting until he hears the blast normally. He counts to just under four seconds which, in his infinite (but badly incorrect) judgement, he tells his daughter is four and a half kilometres. I'm sorry, but the speed of sound in air is approx. 340 metres per second, not over 1,000 m/s! It's nonsense like the above that make the movie into a mindless action-fest and not the clever film that its predecessor was. That, plus the lack of menace in any of the villains, really make the film fall flat on its face.SUMMARY: Dull and repetitive, dumb plot devices and awful science, incompetent villains who aren't scary. Dialled in performances from Neeson and Jansen. A recipe for a movie you'll watch once and then never, ever watch again.",6,0,0,5 January 2013
Fifty Shades of Grey," 50 Shades of Bruising...
","50 Shades of Grey. The title suggests a nuanced film where nothing is black or white and motivations are murky and changeable.Nothing could be further from the truth, I'm afraid. Jimmy Dorman, who plays the titular Mr Grey, has all the nuance and subtlety of a sledgehammer. Further, his supposed sex appeal is non-existent. He's about as appealing as Pennywise the clown, from Stephen King's It, but about twice as creepy! Anastasia Steele, by contrast, gives the impression that she is of sub-par intelligence and is exactly as interesting as listening to your Grandpa's old war stories... for the hundredth time.There is an utter lack of anything like chemistry between the pair and their entire 'relationship' is based around him abusing her and her supposedly enjoying it. Now, I don't have a problem with BDSM whatsoever, but the thing I do know about it is that it is entirely consensual between both parties. If it isn't, then it isn't BDSM, it's plain and simple abuse.Of course, there are those that would argue that, in the context of the movie, the 'consent' was clear and obvious because the woman was content to let it happen. But that is treading on mighty thin ice, friends, and sounds more like justification, than any real argument as to consent.In short, this movie offended me and made me laugh all at the same time, which is rare for a movie to do. I think I was more non-plussed that anyone would find it entertaining and that, along with the awful chemistry and poor acting, made me find humour in it. But I suppose I'm an old fart because I find something distasteful about the subject material. I know, it is a work of fiction, and we should all be able to distinguish fantasy from reality, right? Well, yes, but I have the sneaking suspicion that, despite its 'R' rating, an awful lot of young girls are going to see this movie and if so, then the message this movie sends to them is entirely the wrong one.But, enough of my preaching. It sucks. I looked at my watch many times during the film and went for a stroll around the foyer about half way through so that I might let my eyes witness more interesting things. There was a discarded movie stub that occupied me for several minutes, before I felt obligated to return to the auditorium for the second half of this dreary non-event.The fact that they released it the day before Valentine's Day just leaves me speechless with disbelief.EDIT: Of course this made a ton of money at the box office, so there will be a sequel, and plenty of similar, ripoffs. Remember when we all bemoaned the 'new' craze of Young Adult, Dystopian fantasy films? Welcome to the next big genre folks! Soft-porn at the cinema!SUMMARY: Ridiculous, badly acted and lacking anything like entertainment. No chemistry between the two leads. Glorifies abuse and then tries to tell you that is what you wanted all along. Just a waste of your time. Trust me.",1,64,94,14 February 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Another bloated Batman movie? Must be Chris Nolan then...
","Not that I didn't enjoy some of it, but it just goes on and on and on. I wouldn't mind but the extra minutes don't add anything to the movie.See, there's this trend in comic book hero movies to make them darker, more moody, and to make the heroes more human, more believable. I have to say I generally applaud any attempt to inject realism into any movie.However... With the basic premise of such movies being people with extraordinary powers/gifts/technology etc. it can sometimes be at the expense of making the movie too confused, as if it doesn't know what it wants to be.This is true of Dark Knight Rises. We're supposed to feel empathy for Bruce Wayne when he falls on hard times, but he comes across as a sniveling whiner for the most part. Place this against the cardboard villain that is Bane and the disconnect between the two styles becomes problematic.As well as this issue, and the aforementioned bloat, comes the complete stupidity of the script. Now, we can all watch a movie a dozen times and see things wrong with it on those subsequent viewings. But when you see those wrongs on the first viewing, it becomes obvious that the writing wasn't as tight as it could have been.Bruce Wayne's back, for instance. Having had it broken by Bane, Bruce is thrown into a prison and left to rot. With such awesome medical advice as 'You need to get up' thrown at him, Bruce's back magically heals to the point where he can throw himself around like Ezio Auditore from Assassin's Creed games. All in the space of a few months.Later, with just a few seconds on the clock, he ejects from the Bat Jet just before a nuclear explosion... and survives! That's right! A muscle-bound oaf breaks his back but a nuclear inferno doesn't even singe his hair. What's more, he even manages to swim miles to shore afterwards.Then there is that muscle-bound oaf...Bane. A man with a muzzle for a face. Something was supposed to have happened to him in childhood to force him to wear it, but it isn't really explained. So basically he goes through the whole movie looking like a poor Darth Vader impersonator who couldn't afford the whole costume. Add to that the fact that he mumbles most of his lines incoherently and it just makes him a figure of ridicule, not menace. I couldn't stop chuckling every time he was on screen. To think Arnie got ridiculed for his Mr. Freeze performance and now we have this touted as a believable villain? Tom Hardy isn't very good at bad guy roles. He was rubbish in Star Trek Nemesis, and he's rubbish here. Good actor, just not the roles he's suited to, though to be fair, it is hard acting around a muzzle, I guess.Also, we're supposed to believe that the US Government would sit idly by whilst a oafish buffoon (Bane) holds an entire city to ransom for months? Come on, get a grip! It would never happen that way. The troops would go in regardless of the potential consequences.It's all very silly and very badly thought out. If it was played for camp value, like the old Batman movies, or the series, then it would be fine. But it is supposed to be realistic, so the silliness just makes it farcical.Batman Begins was a decent movie. The second one was bloated and tedious. This one is marginally better than no. 2, but not by much. There's too much else wrong with it for it to come close to the first one.What needs to happen is for the studios to give the franchise to someone else, not the Nolans. They had their shot. Time to move on.SUMMARY: Bloated and farcical. A villain as menacing as Trap Jaw from the He-Man cartoons. Foolishness and plot holes, unbelievable medical miracles and daring escapes from nuclear annihilation. For Nolan fans only. If you want a decent superhero movie with human interest and well-written characters, go watch the Avengers, or the first Iron Man movie, because you won't find any of those qualities here.",6,3,6,6 December 2012
Black Panther," Formulaic and overhyped
","I know, I know... what was I expecting? A masterpiece of cinema from a story based upon comic books? Well, apparently that is what it is supposed to be judging by all the critical acclaim that it has garnered. However, I found it to be about as formula-driven and predictable as I have come to expect from Marvel movies. In short, it is just more of the same, wrapped up in a nice veneer of 'Oh look! Not very many white people! How groundbreaking!'Not that Black Panther is a bad movie. Far from it. But it is not the be-all and end-all of movie craft that some would have you believe.The acting is fair and there is the ever-present Marvel sense of humour throughout. CGI is decent, though the titular character does have acrobatic moments which gave me PTSD-like flashbacks to Catwoman's unrealistic gymnastics. Overall, though, the movie is solid enough and a pleasing diversion. So what is my issue with it?Well, its just more of the same. It may be Marvel fatigue setting in, but you'd think they'd at least try to do something different with the story. But no... it's the same 'Costume-clad hero who doubts himself takes on cardboard evil villain in a fight to the death and ultimately emerges victorious and with a new appreciation for his place in the scheme of things'At its most basic, this is every Marvel movie, of course, but given the hype surrounding this one, I had hoped for a little more. Apparently my hopes are not to be.SUMMARY: A bit dull, honestly and with an over-reliance on the usual Marvel tropes to carry it through. Diverse cast, but not very diverse script. Formulaic, predictable and just more of the same.",6,1,2,3 May 2018
Iron Man," An excellent movie....well worth a watch
","All I can say is, give this one a chance. The movie moves along at a fine rate, there is action aplenty and it doesn't insult your intelligence particularly badly.Robert Downey Jr is excellent in the role of the socially mal-adapted Tony Stark whose world is turned upside down when he gets captured by 'evil terrorists (tm)'. He realises the error of his ways and sets out to change the world.In short, the movie develops Stark's character and lets you see how he becomes who he is. The technology on display is quite far-fetched, but it serves to further the story, not dominate it, or be used as a 'get out of trouble' card by the hero.Comparing this to the year's other big superhero movie, The Dark Knight, there is really no viable comparison. Iron Man is leagues better in terms of coherent story, pacing and acting. Additionally, the movie leaves you wanting more, unlike TDK which drags on endlessly.In short, if you want a decent action hero movie, you could do far worse than see Iron Man. It's also nice to see the little cameo at the end that hints at future cooperation between the different superhero franchises.Well worth watching.",8,2,4,23 September 2008
Mother!," A movie of Biblical pretentiousness...
","So, I'm not a fan of Aronofsky. He is clearly a man who thinks he is far cleverer than he actually is. Mother shows this faux genius for the hack that he is.Mother is an allegorical Bible class from a man who seems to have cherry-picked a few Bible characters and stories, put them into his scriptwriting software, and danced with glee at the resulting mess.Mother is possibly one of the most ham-fisted, 'my audience is dumb, so I must not be subtle' movies I have ever seen. There is no subtlety here. Aronofsky bludgeons you about the head with his allegory (more on that later) with all the zeal of Conan the Barbarian going about a murder spree.In fact, the movie is essentially nothing but allegory. The story is nothing but allegory. There is no real plot. Nothing that resembles reality. In fact, it resembles more of an art-house movie than an actual film for the masses. And that brings me to my current, most-hated, aspect of the movie industry.... misrepresentation.The trailers for this film paint a horror story in which poor Jennifer Lawrence and her writer husband are assailed by strangers and things get increasingly weird and dangerous. It is not a horror movie (well, it is horrible) but you get what I mean. People going into this expecting to see a by-the-numbers scare flick will have no idea what they are getting into. They will feel cheated. They will feel misled. They will be right.Accordingly, the scorn poured by these people on to this film cannot, in good conscience, be felt to be unfair. When you open your tub of Hagen-Dasz and find a dead rat inside, it is hard not to be outraged by the deception.The only reason I can fathom for why Hollywood does this kind of 'Bait-and-Switch' trailer/film routine is because they just want more butts on seats. They really don't care about their audience if they try to mislead them in such a way. Money is the bottom-line here.So, misrepresentation and ham-fistedness aside, is it any good? At best, it is.... meh! You can't really judge this as you would any other film because it doesn't conform to typical film standards. There is no plot, because it isn't based in reality. There is only allegory. Oh yeah, about that...Wikipedia defines allegory as a metaphor whose vehicle may be a character, place or event, representing real-world issues and occurrences...largely because it can readily illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers, readers, or listeners.I would put it to you that an additional footnote should be added to this description, to wit: Allegory: A literary device often employed by those who like to think themselves smarter than the rest of us but which is usually so poorly implemented as to highlight their ineptitude.So, Darren Aronofsky, you can take you terrible allegorical Biblical nonsense with a side order of Mother Nature and the death of religion and give me my money back. If I want to see a two hour 'Look at what I made!' I'll visit my sister's house and let her small children show me the delights of fingerpainting. Truth is, that'd be a lot more fun, and probably way more 'artistic' than this movie.SUMMARY: Misrepresented nonsense. Brings a new meaning to the term 'Bible Thumping'. More pretentiously thin gruel served up as a main course of a film. Really not worth your time, or money.",4,10,16,20 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Possibly the most boring superhero movie I've ever watched
","I mean, there is action. 10 minutes at the start, an occasional moment scattered here and there and a rather nicely done sequence at the end.However, in order to see those moments, you have to suffer (and I really use that word deliberately here) through another two hours of the most forced plot, the most contrived setups and some of the most cringe-inducing dialogue imaginable.But first, the good things. Affleck as Batman is pretty believable. Certainly he is one of the highlights of the movie. Cavill, almost seems boring by comparison, but he is a serviceable Superman. Gal Gadot surprised me as Wonder Woman, but her portrayal of her alter-ego Diana Prince was less enjoyable. And....that's about it really. Other than to say the effects and cinematography were all top notch and the action scenes were well done.With the given title, you might be forgiven for thinking that the movie centres on a conflict between between the two heroes, which ultimately resolves itself into the beginnings of the Justice League.Well, whilst the latter certainly does appear - literally in the last few minutes of the film - the former is woefully mishandled.The story is childishly written, poorly edited together, and serves to do nothing but make you think of both of these iconic heroes as little more than surly teenagers, angry at some imagined slight.This isn't Batman and it isn't Superman. It's some ill-conceived attempt to make them gritty and edgy. And it fails badly.However, the two heroes are not the worst served of the franchise characters here.Lois Lane's character becomes little more than a 'princess in the tower' trope in this movie, repeatedly requiring Superman to rescue her and then making doe eyes at him (as if Amy Adams could ever make any other sort of eyes). I am genuinely surprised the feminist movement hasn't pounced on this, as it is just the kind of stereotyping that deserves such attack. It makes Lois Lane little more than a walking plot device, there only to get Superman to one location or another by dint of her uselessness.Then, of course, there is Lex Luthor. Wow! Talk about miscasting! Not that I blame Jesse Eisenberg here. No doubt he put his spin on the character from the script he was given, but his clownish, over the top, performance would not be out of place in Batman and Robin. Did Zack Snyder really direct him to do this? If so, then that is where the fault lies. Otherwise, Jesse has the idea that he is acting in an altogether different decade of superhero movie than everyone else.Speaking of Zack Snyder... There are his usual trademarks here... slow-motion (mostly used badly here and only serving to drag out the length of the movie); dream sequences (which are mostly useless padding that you could do without and so badly edited in that if you blink you won't have any idea what is going on for a few moments). Zack also tries to give an almost art-house feel to the movie at points, but lacks the necessary skills to do it convincingly. As a result, it just feels as awkward and contrived as most of the rest of the movie.I really have grave reservations about the whole Justice League thing now. Snyder is directing both of those and has a hand in the writing too. I don't think it is going to end well.Overall, the movie is an interminable mess, made worse by the ludicrous run-time. If this was a series and not a film, this would be the filler episode.I'm not sure how this got to release in its current format. Were there no test screenings? Did no one say 'You know, it's kind of boring most of the time.' Or were they all just wowed by the final action scenes and decided to be lenient on the questionnaires at the end. Or maybe those response forms were badly crafted and simply didn't have the requisite 'How many times did you fall asleep during the movie?' multi-choice tick box questions that it should have had.Either way, it's one of the weakest superhero movies I've seen for a long time. If you don't believe me, then I'll just add this final thought: I enjoyed the Fantastic Four more than I did this movie! Finally, a public service notice...TIP FOR HOW TO VIEW THIS MOVIE: Watch the first ten minutes or so, then make up any reason you like in your head for why Batman and Superman are enemies (trust me, whatever you come up with will be better than what is actually here, and will likely be less ridiculous). Then fast forward to the one hour thirty minute mark and watch the remainder of the movie. Voila! You just turned a bloated two and a half hour snooze-fest into a one hour action movie.SUMMARY: Dull and tedious for much of its run-time. Contrived plot, badly served characterisations and a level of bloat that will have you reaching for the Tums bottle.",5,18,33,29 April 2016
Bruce Almighty," Harmless fun
","Jim Carrey has shown in the past that he can do serious comedy (The Truman Show), and he can do whacked-out comedy (The Mask). I get the feeling he wasn't sure quite how to play this one, and as a result his character comes across as a little schizophrenic, jumping from the aforementioned Truman to Ace Ventura at the drop of a hat. However the farcical comedy is kept to a minimum and this works to the movie's benefit.I didn't find it hilarious, but it was an enjoyable, fun film to watch. Not one of Carrey's best, but not a stinker either. Morgan Freeman gave a most restrained (I suppose dignified is a better word) performance as God and Jennifer Aniston wasn't too bad as Carrey's love interest.Not destined to be a blockbuster (but then, some blockbusters shouldn't be, in my opinion) but a solid enough film and a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.",7,0,0,2 June 2003
Signs," A flawed film, but still worth a watch.
","OK. Well I'm in two minds about Signs. On the one hand, it was nice to see a semi sci-fi movie that wasn't filled with special effects and didn't suffer for the lack of them. On the other hand, the plot was about as difficult to guess from the start as the plot to Titanic. Note that there are some spoilers in the following paragraphs.I hadn't realised M Night Shyamalan directed this until afterwards, but the similarities with Unbreakable and Sixth Sense are apparent. There's the same sort of unearthly theme running throughout all the films.However, the tension built quite nicely and although I kept expecting the film to degenerate into Independance Day, it never did, to its credit.On the other hand, from the first 'Father....Please don't call me Father' line that Mel delivers, it was obvious this was going to be about finding one's faith again. Frankly, I think the film would have been better if Gibson's character had gone the other way at the end, but that's just my opinion.As the tension builds and it looks increasingly like the aliens are going to finish the human race, I couldn't help but think that some kind of Deus ex Machina ending was on the cards. Sure enough, the aliens are defeated by water, of all things.This is where Signs began to loose points in my mind. I'd already been somewhat amused by the fact that the aliens could apparently be defeated by something as simple as a pantry door but later, could get into a boarded up house. But then it rains and their whole invasion is called off? Was it raining everywhere at once? For creatures that had travelled from who knows where to get to Earth and could make their ships invisible, didn't they think to bring a raincoat? If they'd visited Earth before, you'd think they'd have noticed the fact that it's a very wet planet.The ending isn't even that original. I can think of two films, War of the Worlds and Day of the Triffids, where the enemy are defeated by such simple means.It's a good concept for a film and it's sad that the aliens weren't thought out a little more beforehand. A flawed film, but still worth a watch.",6,1,3,23 December 2002
Identity," Thoughtful and entertaining
","Wow! Finally another movie that makes you think about what you're seeing as opposed to presenting you with endless special effects. Not, perhaps, as thought-provoking as Memento, but enjoyably brain exercising nonetheless.Having gone into this movie, as I prefer to, with no preconceptions, I assumed it was a simple whodunnit. I was pleasantly surprised to find the greater depth and plot twists involved. Actually, even as a whodunnit, forgetting the real plot for a moment, it works pretty well.There are more red-herrings in this movie than the North Sea fishing fleet has, so be warned that whatever you think is going on, probably isn't.All of the characters have decent roles. There are no Star Trek 'red shirt' security men here, waiting to be killed off. No one whom you think from the start 'he's dead'. The killer could be anyone, no one person stands out head and shoulders above the rest.Every time you think you know what's going on, the rug is pulled out from under you and you have to start over again. The final revelation is elegant and thoughtful and, whilst it trivialises much of what you've just watched a bit, it is nevertheless an original idea and made me glad I went to see this film.Sadly, because of it's nature, this is a one-view film. Although it may be worth watching again to see if you can spot the clues to the truth of the situation. And it's certainly a good film to watch with someone who hasn't seen it, just to watch their reactions.Well worth a watch.",9,4,7,29 May 2003
Live Free or Die Hard," Try Hard 4.....just a bit too trying...
","Well, I was reasonably entertained. But most of the entertaining is down to seeing Bruce Willis on screen again. The story, muddle-headed as it is, just makes you shake your head mostly.As for the action, it's reasonable enough, but hampered by a 13 rating it was never going to have the grit and gore of the earlier films. That said, there are some original scenes (the car into helicopter one, for example) but mostly its tired old stuff we've seen before (and done better) in other movies. The jet attacking vehicles on the freeway seems to have been lifted mostly from True Lies. Our hero even ends up on top of the jet just like Arnie did in True Lies.Later there was the scene where nobody driving in a suddenly darkened tunnel remembered that their cars had lights..nonsensical junk, but again, I gritted my teeth and, like McClaine, soldiered on. Sadly, thence came the jet scene and my heart sank, accompanied by an uncontrollable rise in my indignation.And whilst I mention the jet/freeway scene it is with continuing regret that I have to inform you that scriptwriters continue to ignore anything remotely like common sense when writing scenes. Just like with MI:3, here they put a high-tech warmachine into a situation it blatantly doesn't have to be in to accomplish its task. At one point the jet (is the F35 even in service yet?) hovers down and under the freeway to get at its target. Who would have thought a semi-trailer rig would be so difficult to hit? I'd detected the seeds of 'Hollywoodism' much earlier on in the movie, what with the standard portrayal of anything to do with hacking being colourful 3D graphics and more screens than a Benidorm beach in high summer. But I'd gritted my teeth, snorted in derision and continued to watch anyway, hoping that was the worst of it.A great franchise was ruined by this movie because of the idiocy of scene-writers and the greed of the studios.Luckily for me however, the movie is already fading to a dim memory. It wasn't really that memorable anyhow.RIP...Die Hard.",6,5,8,6 August 2007
Lucy," Overblown nonsense that is only marginally entertaining.
","Difficult one to call, this. On the one hand, the science is absolute nonsense, but it manages (just) to keep your interest to the end. I can't say I was sad when the end came, more relieved.The worst thing about Lucy is that it takes itself entirely too seriously for a film with this much nonsense in it. I will happily ignore all kinds of BS if the movie is entertaining or pokes fun at itself, or does something clever with the silliness. Lucy does none of those things.Instead, it tries to be a bit preachy with its humans and nature are intertwined, we only use 10 percent of our brains, blah blah blah stupidity. As a result, it comes across as too up itself.It's a shame really, because there was a good concept in the story that just wasn't done justice to by the film.My major issue was with the sudden onset of superpowers all tied to the increase in Lucy using her brain more. Why? How? It basically is saying that, if we learn to use our whole brain capacity, we will become gods! Which of course ignores the fact that we are still evolving and, presumably, our brains will increase in size and capacity over time. So what is special about the human brain at the precise instant in time that Lucy takes place? The answer, of course, is nothing. It's just a conceit of the storyteller to think that humans are special and that all we lack is the ability to use all of our brain in order to become masters of everything.Lucy walks a very unsteady line between science and magic, if I'm honest, with things happening... because!... and with little attention to consistency.Lucy herself apparently turns into a soulless automaton as the result of her 'evolution' (yes, the quotes are deliberate there), making you wonder why anyone would want such an ability in the first place. She kills, she maims, she shows no regard for anybody's life. Yet we are supposed to cheer her on? It is all nonsense and has been done better in a number of other movies already. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that Besson butchered this. It probably would have been better in the hands of Michael Bay! All in all, not worth the time unless you like frowning at the screen and saying 'Why?' a lot, interspersed with plentiful numbers of confused glances with your neighbours at the inconsistency of it.SUMMARY: Utter nonsense trying to be clever. It fails at that and also fails at being entertaining for the most part. Pseudo-science gobbledigook that is really not worth your time.",5,2,5,5 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Force Awakens is to Star Wars what Zathura was to Jumanji
","So, I finally got around to watching the new Star Wars movie and although it entertained me, my biggest feeling when I walked out was... disappointment.Disappointment that JJ Abrams seems unable to make a movie without borrowing heavily from any previous franchise work that has gone before. If you thought Star Trek Into Darkness was a ripoff of Wrath of Khan, then you haven't seen how far rehash Abrams is truly willing to go.Force Awakens is, as my tagline suggests, an almost perfect rehash of Episode Four. Beat by beat, scene by scene, set-piece by set-piece, this movie revisits all the plot points of the original movie. The characters get to swap around a little, with some old hands reprising roles of their mentors. Indeed, if it wasn't for the presence of those old hands, then this would be a reboot, not a sequel.So... shameless copy then?It pains me to say it, but that is what this is. Couldn't they have come up with a different story? A different bad guy? How many movies about blowing up the Death Star does Star Wars really need? Does every evil force bent on galactic domination need a Darth Vader analogue? Must there always be an Emperor figure lurking in the background manipulating events? Must the children of Force capable parents always stray to the dark-side? The movie so slavishly copies everything about the original movie that it is embarrassing to watch. But hey, this is designed for a new generation who, apparently, the film-makers decided wouldn't notice they basically remade Star Wars.So with the shameless copying out of the way, is it any good? Well, it is entertaining. I can't deny that. But in considering why I found it so, despite the story plagiarism, I am forced to admit that it was the presence of the original characters that made it so, especially Ford as Han Solo. Not that Ridley and Boyega don't give a good showing as the new generation, but I went primarily to see the old guard.That said, I really wish filmmakers would stop putting classic lines in the mouths of others. It isn't clever. It just takes you out of the moment.Whilst I'm at it, what was with Darth Emo? I mean, seriously? We are supposed to believe this guy as some badass Sith-wanabee? It's like they learned nothing from the Hayden Christensen fiasco. Darth Stroppy-Manchild even has tantrums, for God's sake! The plot between the end of Return of the Jedi and the start of this movie has been hand-waved away, for the most part. There is some info in the opening crawl but it amounts to 'Some elements of the old Empire survived and.... yada-yada... bullshit-bullshit.' Not only did they survive, but they also have the resources and manpower to build a super-death-star and have tens of thousands of men (even though they only ever send a few on vital missions).Other gripes include the galaxy-wide amnesia that sees the Jedi and everything that happened previously as little more than myth, despite the fact that barely forty years have passed. Also, all the old guard have aged appropriately, but Chewbacca's fur looks as glossy as ever. Would it have killed them to throw a few grey hairs in his coat? I get that he's an alien with a longer lifespan, yada-yada. Yet when you see him stood next to Han, it looks like the latter has succumbed to an aging disorder. Minor niggles, perhaps. But niggles nonetheless.It must be heartening to the bad guys, that every time they are defeated, despite huge losses, they come back stronger than before.It's... disappointing, as I said. They could have done so much more with the franchise than this. So much more.I can only hope they move into new territory with the next movie, because I swear, if there is an ice planet in it and Luke starts talking like Yoda and Darth Emo entombs someone in Carbonite, there will be hell to pay.SUMMARY: Basically Episode 4, but not as good. A slavish remake of the original with the same everything in it, down to lines, settings, iconic scenes and character roles. Entertaining, but marred badly by this lack of originality.",6,11,15,23 March 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," If only all movies were this good, fantasy or otherwise.
","What everyone else says, goes double for me. This movie rocks! I won't bore people with a long and gushing praise-singing of the film. In fact, I'm going to do the exact opposite. I'm going to pick out the tiny faults that stopped me from giving the film a 10 and only a 9 in the ratings.Firstly, it was just TOO much! The battle scenes were SO busy, I'm expecting to have to watch them several times more just in order to see everything that was going on. A minor niggle, really, but it will make me watch the movie again, so that's no bad thing.Secondly, what happened to Saruman? Not a hair do we see of him in the theatrical version. I only hope his scenes are added to the extended DVD version which will no doubt be released next year. Somehow, Pippin finding the Palantir in the water at the foot of Orthanc isn't nearly as satisfying as having Grima throw it at the group. I hope they change that back for the DVD.Thirdly, really an extension of the above I suppose, there are a number of points in the movie where it was apparent that they had cut out bits to save on running time. I trust these will be restored in the DVD as well.Finally, <spoiler ahead>, at the end, was I the only one who felt that Gollum and Frodo's struggle for the Ring was just a little bit silly? I think they should have done that from both Sam's viewpoint (as in the movie) and also from Frodo's perspective in the Shadow-world, and inter-cut the two. That way they could have shown Gollum's solution to getting the Ring back in more detail and it wouldn't have looked quite so silly.But all of the above are really minor gripes, most of which I hope will be fixed in the extended DVD.All in all, the three movies are a fine set of films and I'm hoping they will revive interest in the fantasy genre amongst the movie studios. It would also be nice to see fantasy films being treated as story and character driven epics rather than excuses to overindulge in special effects at the expense of any plot or character development. Anyone remember the abyssmal 'Dungeons and Dragon' movie? Yech! So here's hoping that the LOTR trilogy will bring about a renaissance in fantasy movie making.And even if they don't, we'll always have these three - well, I will, anyway, in my DVD collection.",9,0,0,19 December 2003
Godzilla," Is that it? What was the fuss about?
","I mean, it is like they followed some screenplay writer's Bible when they made this.The plot is horribly simple and boring. The characters are so one-dimensional that I kept expecting them to vanish when they turned sideways and the action? Let's just say it plods along and leave it at that.The CGI is good, of course, as you'd expect and the scenes of destruction are well done. But since a considerable portion of the movies budget went on them, you'd expect them to be good.There was also, with this movie, a new pet-hate of mine (to join 3D, found footage movies, laughable physics and so on) in the form of needless explanation.See, writers fall into two camps, for the most part. Those, like Damon Lindeloff (who gave us Lost, the red matter from Star Trek and the heinous rewriting of the Prometheus script) who explain nothing. Quite often that is because they can't explain it any other way other than to wave their hands and go 'Whoooo! Magic!'.Then there are those who explain too much. You know what I mean here. George Lucas and his sodding Midichlorians! That never needed explaining George! Well, in Godzilla, we have an example of the last type. Unnecessary explanation.Hands up who went to watch this movie expecting to find out where Godzilla came from? What? No one? Okay then. So none of us.Yet here, we are treated to Godzilla and co essentially being explained away as 'Super dinosaurs' from the dim past. Not only that, but then poor old Ken Watanabe has to repeatedly spout some Gaia nonsense about Godzilla being the one to 'restore balance'. Balance of what, exactly? Nature? These things are about as natural as Cthulhu, for God's sake! And no amount of 'But they're just big dinosaurs!' will change that.What is worse, is that Ken then goes on to describe Godzilla as an apex predator. What is it, Ken? Predator or 'one destined to bring balance'? And predator of what, exactly? We learn that all of these monsters feed on radioactivity. What kind of predatory instinct is required to sneak up on a chunk of uranium? As I said, unnecessary explanation that only confuses and confounds the viewer. Much like the force, we don't need Godzilla explained. Just let him fight other monsters and be done with it.You don't need to explain Godzilla. We know he's on our side. Jibber-jabber about maintaining the balance is just laughable. What balance? He kills any other monster! That's not balance. That's just Godzilla being a shitbag to other monsters!There is also a real lack of tension at any point in the film. You'll be mentally ticking off the plot points well before they happen and expecting every scene well before it arrives. In addition to this, there is a really annoying tendency to cut away from the monster fighting action at literally every opportunity in order to focus on the 'human drama'.Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a leading man doesn't do very well here. I'd like to blame the director, or writer, but Bryan Cranston manages to shine with his limited screen time and even Gaia-spouting Watanabe manages to be convincing about his gibber. ATJ, on the other hand, has about as much on-screen charisma as a lobotomy victim and as much personality as a paper picnic plate. Awful casting choice!He's not the only casting dud, however. Elisabeth Olsen is given little to do as the wife who can't think for herself and manages to 'cry' many times without producing a single tear. Likewise her son, played by Carson Bolde, was clearly told to look sad all the time. This, unfortunately, makes him look like internet meme 'Grumpy Cat' for most of the scenes he is in.As for the ending, well, it is a bit anti-climactic, with Godzilla (whom we all feared was dead, right?!) getting up and shambling off into the ocean and swimming away. Oddly enough the ending does fit the movie rather well, because it gives it a kind of 'Oh, Is that it? Best get up and go home then.' feel which sums up my feeling as the credits began to roll.SUMMARY: Not a bad attempt at recapturing the old Godzilla feel. Hampered by a poor script, poor characters and lots of pointless explanatory drivel. No real tension and a somewhat dull ending which sums up the movie in a nutshell. Worth it if there isn't anything better to watch.",6,2,4,13 July 2014
Looper," Well, it was full of nonsense, but I enjoyed it.
","I'll get on to the nonsense in a moment but first, why did I enjoy it? Mainly because it dealt with themes such as self-sacrifice, personal growth, betrayal, greed and desperation rather well. The main character is inherently unlikeable, but you hope he gets by in the end, nonetheless. In short, take away the scifi elements and it makes a reasonable character drama.But it has its flaws.First off it attempts to be a clever scifi movie in the vein of Inception. I applaud the effort. In fact, I wish more movie-makers would try and be clever with their films. I'm seriously tired of mindless pap like Transformers masquerading as 'good scifi'. So any attempt at being intelligent is to be congratulated.However, they fell at the first hurdle. They chose time-travel. With time travel either you believe there is a single timeline, in which case paradox's cannot exist, or you believe in multiple time lines, in which they can. In the former, things done in the past affect the future and this is what appears to go on in Looper. People send messages to their future selves by scarring their own skin and so on. Unfortunately, Looper starts off assuming the second type. Young Joe, in order to let Old Joe escape, has to also kill Old Joe in the original timeline. This means that when he grows into Old Joe, he can come back, causing a new timeline and escape. However, this also means that, since he is on another timeline, that particular Young Joe isn't him anymore. And, at the end of the movie, it is pretty critical that they are actually one and the same. Phew! So they weren't really sure which they wanted to go with and it does make you say....hang on a minute! That said, the movie is reasonably entertaining. I enjoyed it, despite the lack of a sensible plot. I mean, who is really expected to believe that it's easier to send someone back through time than it is to dispose of them in the future? It's never given more than a moment's explanation and yet, it is the foundation for the whole movie's setup. Its very premise. They could have at least come up with a more solid reasoning behind this, in my opinion.There was a nice side-plot about Old Joe forgetting his wife if Young Joe fell another woman. However, this seems to have been forgotten about towards the end, which is a shame.All in all, it is a reasonable watch. As always with time-travel movies, though, it becomes messy and here, it wasn't treated terribly well. Even so, I recommend it. You'll see the end coming from about half-way through the film, but it is still surprisingly satisfying anyway.SUMMARY: Time-travel, bah humbug! Good characters and drama, try to ignore the premise and ill-thought out science.",6,3,7,17 November 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Unassailable
","When I was 13 I heard tell of a movie that had my childish heart leaping with joy. A sci-fi adventure that, from the trailers, was like nothing I'd ever seen before. Until then, the best that sci-fi had shown me was Star Trek.I counted down the days until it came out and then, one fateful day in the summer, I went to see it. In the queue, I met up with a friend who'd also gone to see the movie alone. So we got tickets and sat together someplace in the middle of the rows. Whilst we waited for the movie to start we, like everyone else there, discussed what we knew of the film, what trailers we'd seen etc..Then the lights dimmed and as the curtains (they had real fancy ones in those days!) drew back from the screen, the 20th Century Fox logo appeared and the signature tune burst into life with deafening loudness.From that moment on I sat open-mouthed, like everyone else, as the film unfolded before us. There were no mobile phones in those days to annoy you, no sniggering teens in the back rows. There were teens, of course, but they were as raptly enthralled as everyone else. In the rare quiet moments of the film, the silence in the auditorium spoke volumes as to what we were bearing witness to - to what we were becoming a part of. The friend whom I was sitting with faded into the darkness - we never exchanged one word during the whole film. Afterwards, as we left, both of us were strangely subdued. The film had stunned us so much that mere words could not begin to explain how we felt. It was almost as if we wanted to savour the moment, as if we knew that such a perfect afternoon's entertainment would never come again. And we'd be right.To say that Star Wars changed my life may seem a conceit. The movie offered nothing more than (for a 13 year old) a fantastic couple of hours entertainment that you wished could go on forever. But it's true nonetheless. For Star Wars, unlike the dry and dreary sci-fi flicks of the time such as Silent Running and Zardoz, offered one thing that no film until then had managed.It opened doors to the imagination. From that point on no movie need be limited by the constraints of the movie-making process. Anything was possible. Of course, it wouldn't be until the advent of CGI that this promise could truly be fulfilled, but after Star Wars, nothing was the same again.My only complaint against Star Wars is that it is no longer available in the original theatre release version. Mr Lucas' Special Edition of the film, though adding much to the movie, also (in my humble opinion) took just as much away. The Special Edition looks slicker, nicer, more complete. But my memories won't let go of the original version, which had such a profound effect upon me. The Special Edition version, whilst fantastic, just doesn't look right to me. To me it's as if the original has been supplanted by some Doppleganger. It may look the same on the surface but......it isn't same.This is perhaps the only time I've ever thought a special version of the film was worse than the original. So here's my hope - that the original version will be released on DVD too. I can't be the only one who would want that, can I? In the rest of my life to date only a few films have ever come close to matching that sense of awe and excitement - Jurassic Park, Aliens and The Fellowship of the Ring. And even they, whilst great films in their own right, do not come that close.But don't take my word for it, go and watch it yourself. Today, of course, it shows its age, and everyone is used to films with huge scope and effects. For those who saw it originally as I did - as a kid at the dawn of FX cinema - I probably don't need to go on. For those who have not seen it - why not? In my other reviews I sometimes pour scorn on movies, scripts, SFX, acting - you name it. Sometimes even I think I can be a little harsh at times. But if I am it's because bad movies shouldn't be made anymore. If they could get it right in 1977, shouldn't they all be great films now? My benchmark for judging other films are the memories of a 13 year old kid. Is it any wonder nothing can live up to them? The only parting comment I'll make about Star Wars is to recommend you see it on a big screen if at all possible. Nothing like that should ever be show on a 14' portable with mono sound. Some films demand a cinema, or at the very least a hefty plasma TV with surround sound. Nothing else will ever do it justice.Enjoy!",10,0,1,29 December 2004
Annihilation," Annihilation: Pacing Not Included
","So, when a trailer paints an action-horror adventure picture of a movie, you can be forgiven for expecting that when you go to see said movie. Annihilation is not an action-horror adventure.What it is, is someone's (Alex Garland's, presumably) idea of a cerebral scifi horror, with allusions to exploring what it is to be human and body shock horror thrown in for 'good' measure.Now, firstly, I hate being misled by trailers. I've almost come to expect it by now, but it colours my view of the movie when I realise I have been duped. Secondly, I also hate pretentiousness in films and Annihilation has this in great supply. It wasn't enough to simply give us a good scifi horror movie, it had to pretend to be deeper than it was. It failed at that.Any depth it might have had was thrown to the wall with the lamentable editing, which seemed designed to slow the movie's progress to a crawl to fill out the two hour runtime. There are, at best, only three or four important set-piece scenes in this movie but they are spaced out massively and the gaps inbetween filled with utterly redundant flashback scenes and filler content. This is, essentially, a short film padded out to feature length.The effects are good, and the acting decent, but the story is full of holes and inconsistencies. Set decoration is variable, with some scenes looking truly amazing and others looking like the props manager raided the moth-eaten floats from some flower festival for lurid paper flowers to stick at random on trees and scenery.The Shimmer has been on Earth for three years, we discover, yet in that time all that has happened is that people have been sent in and have not come out again. From the context of the film, this appears to be the only strategy that seems to be available to the investigators. We are also supposed to believe that all this has been kept secret for that length of time.In the course of the movie, the comms gal tells us that her equipment is working, but that no signals get out of the Shimmer. Great, so technology works but not comms, so why haven't they sent in autonomous robotic machinery? Have it go in, record information, maybe even take samples, then come back out again. Machines can use dead-reckoning navigation far better than humans. No compass, or satnav required. There is no requirement within the story parameters as defined that they needed to send people in at all.Nor is it explained, ultimately, what is going on. This is one of those 'The audience should make their minds up about what is happeneing' kinds of deals. I always dislike these movies, simply because if you have something you want to say, then say it. Don't leave the audience to figure it out.Alex Garland has gravitated to these sorts of pseudo-intellectual shams of late, what with this and Ex Machina. Needless to say they have received rgeat critical acclaim, but only middling success at the box office.I don't have a problem with scifi being thought-provoking. In fact, I prefer it that way. But this is not thought-provoking, so much as head-scratching. An attempt at being clever without looking at your product and realising most people don't have your level of knowledge of it. I'm sure both the script and the book upon which it is based were much more satisfying than the film ended up being. As it stands, the movie is a disappointment and not a movie that most people will seek to re-watch in the future.SUMMARY: Padded out short story that is not engaging and not at all as sold in the trailers. Some good scenes, but too much dull filler and a score that does little to draw you in to the tale. Not recommended.",5,5,11,13 March 2018
Gangs of New York," Yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn....
","Let's see...how to rate this movie....hmmmm...Lots of people fighting and killing each other.....maybe a plus, depending on your filmgoing requirements. But only for a brief few minutes here and there.Hmmm......That's about it, really. Typical subplots involving love interest, racialism and such like, but all thinly done and cliched.I'm not even sure why I watched this movie, other than to avoid watching it in a few years on TV, which I now know to do. It was really, really boring and predictable.As the film progressed I came to hate DiCaprio's character, to the extent that I was hoping Bill would gut him like a fish at the end. Sadly, this was not to be.And what about Bill? Bill Cutting? A man who is a murderous thug who likes to carve people up and who happens to have the surname Cutting. Oh come on! I haven't seen such terrible character naming since the days of Sledgehammer! Why not just name Di Caprio's character Amsterdam Snivelling-Loser and be done with it. Yeah, great name, Mr Scriptwriter, Cutting for a butcher! Har, har! Had me rolling in the aisles. Not!This is not a good movie. Nice cinematography, lousy film. About as much fun as drinking a pot of glue. And I mean the nasty, bad tasting kind, too.Save yourself some time here if you absolutely must go and watch this. After the opening battle, leave the theatre/fast forward until the last ten minutes or so, then resume viewing. The rest is filler, and dull, tedious filler at that.Oh, by the way, another sad moment of this film is that the gunboats don't level the city entirely, which, by that time in the film, you are hoping they will do completely.Dross.",6,0,0,29 June 2003
Windtalkers," Boo-hoo, not Woo-hoo
","When I sat down to watch this film, all I knew about it was that it was about the part the native-Americans had played during WW2.You can imagine my dismay then, when the credits rolled and 'A John Woo film' scrolled by. I had been hoping to sit down to an intelligent, well thought-out war film about the part a forgotten few had played in it.Instead I got the Woo trademarks - violence, more violence, pointless doves, more violence, people pointing empty guns at each other and people leaping about with two pistols firing. Oh, and even more violence.The two Navajo in the story were relegated to minor characters who didn't have one good line to say between them.There was an almost laughable sideline featuring a racist soldier (Noah Emmerich) who comes to appreciate the Navajo. It was so cheesily done that it was painful to watch. The cast were all a bit weary looking. As if they'd had enough of being in the movie. When Christian Slater turned up I actually felt sorry for him. But Nicolas Cage went through the film as if on sedatives for the most part.Overall, this film reminded me of those old war films you were forced to watch as a kid because your parents loved them. Lots of action but not a lot of plot. And it just went on and on and on. No cheers when they took the final Japanese position, only a relief that it was all nearly over.Woo films are getting progressively worse in my opinion. Broken Arrow was an OK film, MI2 was tolerable (but getting silly) and this is just his worst to date.",3,0,1,22 December 2002
Warcraft," Warcraft fans will love it.
","First off, I'm going to address the reasons why people hate this movie. Simply put, it throws you in the deep end of a complicated and involved mythos and expects you to either go with it, or gtfo. There is precious little in the way of explanation of who the characters are, why they have the motivations they do, or how they all interact with one another.In short, if you know something of the lore around the Warcraft game, you'll be a lot happier than someone who knows nothing. Most of the negative reviews seem to come from the latter camp of people, and for that, I can, for once, hardly blame them. After all, plenty of people who had never read the Lord of the Rings enjoyed the movies of that franchise without any prior knowledge of Tolkien's world.So in essence, what I am saying is that Warcraft does a poor job of explaining its world an people.That said, I think this was always going to be a film that would be appreciated more by the fans of the games. I include myself in this group and I can honestly say I found it enjoyable. The bright colours and larger than life characters may not be for everyone, but for game fans, there is little to complain about.Characterisation is a bit thin. Again, the movie expects you to know a little about the players in its universe before going into it. It is effectively hoping the game has done all that pesky familiarisation for you, allowing you to just enjoy the plot.As for the plot... well, it details the arrival of the orcs into Azeroth and the ensuing conflict that arises with the existing races. The orcs are somewhat huge in comparison to the humans and the action does a good job of getting that strength across visually.Effects-wise it is something of a hit-and-miss affair, with some of the facial CGI being amazing and some of the mass battle effects looking weak. Likewise, the sorcery and magic effects are very well done. Overall, however, there is nothing too bad to complain about, and the balance is definitely on the positive side.Dialogue is at times decent, occasionally laughable and sometimes dire. No one will win any awards for this but there are enough moments of genuine humour amongst the verbal clangers that it somehow manages to overcome the writing deficiencies and veer into cheesy-goodness as opposed to direness.So what you have is an action-fantasy story with a deep background that most average folks will never understand, coupled to thinly developed characters and a plot of world domination that wouldn't be amiss in a 30's serial.Yet, somehow it manages to work. Maybe it is because I have that background knowledge, or maybe Duncan Jones has managed to make the impossible work, but Warcraft is an entertaining movie to watch. It won't win any awards, as I already said, but it kept me watching to the end, which makes no sense when I consider all of the component parts individually. But as a whole, it is definitely greater than the sum of its parts.Is it worth your time? Well that depends on whether you are a fan of the games or fantasy in general. If yes, then I'd say give it a go, and ignore all the critical reviews that slam it. Make your own mind up. If you are not such a fan, you might find it confusing and simplistic and not very satisfying.SUMMARY: Mostly for Warcraft fans. Lots of weak points, but yet manages to work in spite of this. If they make a sequel, I'll go see it.",7,1,1,10 June 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," I think my brain developed a tumour watching this...
","At least, that's the only reason I can think of for it pounding so hard. And no, I didn't even watch the 3D version.So here we go again, another edition of Bay-watch. In this episode we'll discover that Michael Bay is still suffering from terminal 5 year-old syndrome and is unable to do anything that might remotely interest an adult audience.I could wax lyrical about film-making, the effects, the acting etc. But all that would do is give Bay some credibility and admit that he actually produced a movie, instead of the headache inducing, brain-inflaming mess that I just watched.So instead, whilst it's still horribly, and garishly, fresh in my mind, I'll spell out the things I observed from this hideous assault on the senses.1. When Bumblebee is a car, he is spotless. Not a scratch on him. But when he is a robot he is battered and scratched (even the car parts). Good continuity there...not! 2. Rosie Doodad Whats-her-name cannot act and has lips that were so over-pumped I thought Bay was going to have them explode, too.3. Building design has reached the stage where it is almost impossible to destroy a skyscraper, no matter how much abuse you subject it to.4. Let's give our alien robots human-like traits and personalities, right down to ethnic accents. Because, like, you know all alien species develop like humans, right? 5. Planets that are teleported right next to each other won't cause the slightest gravitational disturbance, honest! 6. If in doubt, make cuts that make no sense and miss out vital bits of the story. Instead, leave in the bits that are totally pointless, like Sam's parents and the rubbish actress with rubber lips.7. Chemistry. 5 year olds like Bay don't know much about that, which is why the pairing of La Bouef and Rubber Lips have none.8. If in doubt, explosions! People love explosions! Explosions for two hours! No plot or meaningful dialogue, just explosions! 9. Bumblebee's speech processor...they still haven't fixed it after three movies. Just what kind of highly 'advanced' alien robots are these that they can't fix that? 10. Tomahawk cruise missiles...can apparently be used to target aerial combatants. No, seriously! It's in the movie! It must be true.11. No, that's enough. My brain is reaching meltdown. I can't type any more.Needless to say, if you're bored enough to risk watching this...DON'T! If you're that bored then watching this will KILL you! It's totally mind-numbing and tedious. Suitable only for those with exceedingly low expectations and even lower IQ's.SUMMARY: Dull, 45 minutes too long, a terrible assault on the senses and the intelligence. There, I've warned you...don't come crying to me when you have an aneurysm from watching it.",Null,2,6,13 October 2011
Shark Tale," Very hit and miss
","Shark Tale is not a bad film. A lot of thought and effort went into making this picture. Yet, when you sit down and watch it, two things become apparent.First, and most obviously, the movie is very hit and miss. Some scenes work well, others fall flat or are downright dull and tedious.Secondly, just who was the target audience? Very small children will, no doubt, appreciate the bright colours and simple action sequences, but if they are the audience, then why so many more adult themes here than, say, in Shrek? If adults were the target group, then why the silliness intended solely for children? In short, it comes across as a film uncertain as to what it was trying to achieve, and who it was primarily aimed at. As a result of this dithering, the film, which could have worked well if a specific audience was targeted, meanders along with little direction and little to keep you watching with anything other than mild interest.Will Smith reprises his role as The Fresh Prince here verbatim, almost to the point of annoyance. The others mostly have a good time with their voice roles but there aren't really any stand-outs among them, though it was good to hear Peter Falk in a role.In short, this one is purely for the little kids, who'll no doubt watch it again and again with glee. But for the adults, the humour runs out long before the end of the first viewing. Disappointing.",5,3,9,24 January 2005
Alien: Covenant," Alien... This time its snore...
","I don't even know where to begin with this one. I wasn't impressed with Prometheus and I had hoped...hoped... that lessons had been learned from that monstrosity. But clearly the only take-away that Ridley Scott had from the reaction to that movie was 'People want more Aliens!' So we come to Alien Covenant. A movie filled with forgettable characters whose deaths (almost always the result of their own stupidity) are tiredly predictable and completely avoidable.Remember in Prometheus when all the 'scientists' do really dumb things purely in the name of pushing the plot-driven mess ahead? Well, prepare for so much more of the same in Covenant. It's as if they have no training in space exploration at all and are just regular Joes that have been fired off into space. No...scratch that. Regular Joes would have far more common sense than the crew in this movie. They should have name the movie Alien: Incompetence.They open doors on alien worlds without checking for microorganisms, prod plants that release spores that they then inhale and only answer the radio with vague responses instead of concise answers. The list is pretty endless and all it does it to make you glad that they all die off horribly.Of course, the writers are to blame. This is another example of the increasing trend towards 'Get the characters to do something to further the plot' regardless of how retarded those character actions appear to anyone with a brain stem. All that matters is driving the plot forward. Never mind about common sense.Speaking of the characters, you really won't care about any of them. The characters in A:C are so thinly sketched as to be essentially invisible. You won't get to know them, or even their names for the most part. That's because they have been written with the same lack of attention as the teenagers in a slasher flick. They are there purely to die in various ways, so why bother fleshing them out? That was the mentality here. Also, good luck trying to guess who is who's partner in this 'couples' expedition into space. That, unsurprisingly, is also not bothered with.Another thing...CGI aliens. Sometimes looking as bad as they did in Alien 3, but always unconvincing. But as bad as the CGI was, it pales into insignificance next to Scott's explained genesis of the xenomorphs. It's lame, and is on the same level as George Lucas' midichlorians reveal. We didn't need to know this. They were better as monsters of unknown provenance. The reveal was terribly insulting.So, as you can tell, Alien Covenant is a hot mess. If all you want is aliens ripping people apart you are well served here, but if you wanted a coherent story, with likable characters and a satisfyingly muttered 'Oh! Is it over?' at the end then look elsewhere.I can't help but wonder what Neil Blomkamp's alien film might have looked like. I suspect it would have been far more enjoyable and worthwhile. But no, we got Ridley 'It's my franchise!' Scott and his increasingly desperate attempts to prove he is still a decent director.Here's a thought, Ridley? Why not actually read through the screenplay before you start shooting it. That way, you might actually notice it is dumb and be able to do something about it.EDIT: I forgot to mention the tiny lickle baby aliens that sprout from hosts now. Fully formed, miniature versions of the adults. Did Ridley just forget how they looked before this? Is this what dementia looks like? Joking aside, when you are making a horror movie and a monster bursts out of a hapless victim, the last thing you expect a viewer to do is go 'Aah! It's so cute!'SUMMARY: Makes you want to say 'Come back AvP, all is forgiven. Lessons learned from Prometheus = 0. This franchise needs either a long rest, or a director/writers that really care about it. Not really worth your money.",5,10,22,14 May 2017
Furious 7," Furious 7: Jumping the Shark
","I wanted to like this. Really, I did! As Paul Walkers final film, I was hoping they would have done something interesting and different with the story and they did. But not in a good way.In essence, they tried to turn Furious 7 into Mission Impossible. Before very long in the movie, the gang are working for 'Da Man' - in this case Kurt Russel - and helping him recover a piece of technology for the security forces. Said technology will then be used to help them find Jason Statham's character, who is out to get them.Sounds reasonable, right? Unfortunately, this premise is quickly overwhelmed with utterly ridiculous nonsense such as cars parachuting out of a plane to land perfectly on a winding mountain road; Coaches armed with mini-guns down the sides like some kind of road-going galleon; Reinforced concrete parking structures that collapse like they are sandcastles on a beach; People fighting and hitting each other in the face with plumber's wrenches and barely even feeling it.You get the idea? It is ridiculous. As if they just decided to ramp up the stupid and to hell with it.So is it really that bad? Well, I guess if you have no understanding of how the real world works - physics, gravity and so on - then I suppose it is a decent enough action film. The problem really lies with how this movie takes itself far too seriously. None of the aforementioned excesses would be out of place in a comedy spy film. Yet here, they just stand out. Instead of saying 'Whoah! Did they just do that?' you end up saying 'You've gotta be effing shitting me!' Furious 7 is a parody of its own franchise, piling on the impossible action and saying 'To hell with the consequences'. After the previous outing, I didn't think they could make it any more unbelievable, but they have.The result is an unsatisfying movie where nobody dies except the bad guys and everyone has Neo-like abilities when it comes to defying gravity and physics. It's just too much. Far from being a fitting send-off to the franchise, it just ends up teeth-grittingly annoying and tiresome.So was there anything good? Well, there was some interesting camera-work in the early fight sequences, with the camera following characters as they rolled around. Literally the camera rolled with them. Quite a nice effect, actually. The car driving was, as usual, enjoyable to watch, though the stunts were less so.However, other than that, there is little to recommend this movie apart from the silliness. If you've seen other F&F movies, this one is just more of the same, but done in such an over-the-top manner as to make it tedious, not exciting.SUMMARY: Beyond ridicule. Too much excess that no one tried to reign in. Tries to reinvent itself as a spy-action movie. Not so much Mission Impossible, as Mostly Impossible.",6,4,18,15 September 2015
