The Incredible Hulk," Good effort but not great
","I'd say that the film was excellent.... for the first 30 minutes up until the point in which Hulk first see's Liv Tyler's Betty Ross.The performances are excellent... Edward Norton is an excellent Bruce Banner, plus Tim Roth and William Hurt are outstanding in supporting roles.And then theirs Liv Tyler... the worst actress in a Marvel film. Not only is her character absolutely one note and useless, Liv Tyler's performance doesn't make matters better. She's unbelievable, and wooden. I wanted to knock myself unconscious whenever she had screen time. She did nothing whatsoever to contribute, and only pumped out wooden dialogue one after another.The visual effects are top notch. The final battle scene between Hulk and the Abomination is eye popping and well designed and crafted. Virtually all of Hulk's scenes stand out. His facial expressions are breathtakingly realistic.The script works and then doesn't. It fails to provide an emotional pull as well as generally having a lack of character development. It works best with dialogue, and introducing characters, but fails to do anything with them afterward.As I stated previously the first 40 minutes of The Incredible Hulk is top notch. It is emotional, it is satisfying. It is good.Some bits work, others don't. Its not great. But at least it isn't formatted like 2003's Hulk was.",6,0,1,25 November 2014
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," The Author of the book wrote the script - he most not have liked the book he wrote
","Hum this film is OK. Its well i don't really know i sm a bit mixed here. This film had good moments and then bad moments but as you can see the bad moments were a bit more strong then the good moments sadly. The bad moments include the running time,script,faithfulness,confusing,and much more. The running time is just short , the film needed more time for Abe's life to better unfold, we learn nothing of his suffering actually, in the book he suffers horribly in the movie his son's death is the only sad part. This film needed a longer running time or cutting down some of the stupid footage like Mary Todd shooting the vampire girl, they could have made a part 2 and had her in it and more suffering for Abe and it would have been better. That helps me to move in to my next subject with the faithfulness to the great book. This film just like The City Of Ember , is not faithful, it uses maybe acouple characters and the main idea which is Abraham Lincoln Vampire Killer and thats about it. Most characters are new, if they are not then the characters took out of the book have been given the same name just different stories which is just not good not good at all. I was sad with it, it jumped about 50 pages each scene making it very confusing and might i say stupid which i just don't understand being the fact that the person who wrote the book wrote the script for this movie which inda gets me wondering why would he get rid of all those characters and add new ones skipping through the book so fast it is speedy, i think he thought he was writing a sort of revised Abraham, maybe a new won but why do that he could have made a decent two part movie and made lots of money. That leads me into my next discussion, on the script. The script is well as i all ready talked about disappointing it really was being the author of the book wrote the movie script. He i guess thought little of the book he wrote himself and wanted to rewrite it, well here was his chance to- big mistake. This films script had a huge chance of doing well if the author cared more about the book. This movie is very very confusing , as i said before it jumps about 50 pages and it just does not fit well. Stuff is pushed way to hard ,way way to hard. Now onto the good stuff including the visual effects, cast, and the acting. This film's visuals are by far some of the most magnificent visuals i have seen this whole year, i'm not lying this is in my top two with Life of Pi. Every scene that includes visual effects look beautiful and great. Everything in this film look polished and cleaned and well just so Pretty to look at i mean it is just great. The visual effects were put in the hands of really good people because they made it look real yet something from a wild dream. I just wanted to watch the special effects alone for a long time. The cast was well cast, Rufus Sewell,Mary Elizabeth Winstead , and Anthony Mackie are the highlights but Benjamin Walker was a great casting choice for Abraham Lincoln, he looks and sounds like Abe would have , this film was just perfectly cast. The acting was great as well , Mary Elizabeth Winstead was just great to watch and our new Abe Lincoln was also a delightfully talented actor he was. All an All you can tell that everyone involved in this film tried their best (but the author himself Seth Grahame-Smith) this film just was not given the right script to deliver the film.

Finding Neverland," Nothing award winning but at least we get to see Johnny Depp without make up!
","This is an o.k passable film. Johnny Depp gives us a wonderful performance, but the lighting is weak and so are the characters and dialogue. Freddie Highmore gives a sweet performances. This truly is a funny, and heartwarming film, but it doesn't do it with ease as one would hope. It kinda starts out of nowhere and it's plot is kinda confusing. This film Is way to lengthy, needed to be shorter. The characters aren't written as well as you'd hope, and the dialogue is horrid to listen too. This ends on a rather soft note but still doesn't reach expectations. This is o.k and barely passes as a fresh film. At least I finely get to see what Johnny Depp's face really looks like without all the make up. Not very magical but with excellent acting the film makes it over the border from completely disappointing. C",6,0,1,15 September 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not as good as first film, it's still pretty decent
","This review has been deleted 2 times, so i'm just going to start my review with the dang negatives, and say this film has been a slight disappointment based on the fact that it is one of my highly anticipated list of the year and my most anticipated film of the summer. Now i most say the negatives include, lack of tension, poor opening, lack of screen time for villain, and the length. Now to start this review off by saying that the film began with action, instead of starting off the same way the first film started, and starting off slow and building momentum leading up to action then starting over again. By starting with action, i was still trying to comprehend what the hell was going on, and when spock almost got killed, i should have been at the edge of my seat. Was i? No, i still was trying to understand what was happening. And the action never stopped, for a long enough chunk of time for me to feel tension, and emotion at what was happening, this film just didn't build up. I just was never able to feel anything during the spectacular action sequences. There was just to dang much. Thats why i criticize the opening, which featured Kirk running threw a forest of red trees. That scene should have been cut out of the film, or shortened, so we could include more story development, and more screen time for our villain,, which leads me into my next argument which is of the amount of screen presence of our villain. Our villain should have had a lot more time on screen then he received he should have caused a lot more destruction before fleeing to another planet and being captured by Kirk. I felt he was well enough characterized but he should have received more time to do his evil stunts, and to add to why he is a bad ass villain. As well as more screen time for Kirk and Spock interacting before space. This film should have been hobbit sized, and 3 Hours. That leads me into my complaint of the length. This film just had too short of a length too accommodate all of it's needed materials, as i have already explained to you all. I suggest cutting, or trimming the opening which featured Spock in a volcano, and Kirk running from wild animal creatures. This scene to me felt un - necessary. Now that we have discussed the issues of the film, lets move onto the positive side of the film. That includes the acting, casting of the villain, special effects, humor, screen- play, costumes, and direction. The acting in this film, is spot on. It's all very realistic and well toned. Zachary Quinto as Spock is once again excellently acted, and performed, i believe his seriousness and he is an emotional draw. Benedict Cumberbatch, is another splendid actor, who gave his soul to this film, he played a believable villain, and seemed very much sinister and scary. He is a very impressive villain, and one of the best actors of the now. Other actors to mention include newbie Alice Eve, and Chris Pine who both perform a bit above standards. The special effects of the film are spot on, and realistic too the point of believing they are really there. They make this film glimmer, and shine, and polish this beautiful film. This film is very humorous, which plays very well to this mostly serious film. This lightens the story and makes it less dark, and more fun to watch, which has worked very well with this particular film i must say. Now as for the screen play other then the lack of more screen time for the villain and some un necessary scenes, the script is pretty good ta making suitable lines for the film, this was pretty good, and was not cheesy at all. The costumes in this film are very original, and very well detailed to the point where they seem like they had come off of the actual t.v show. They were well designed , and pretty cool to look at for me, i want one. And finally, we close this with a dedicated thank you to the director, for bringing us another winner in the end- J.J Abrams. He has accomplished himself, as a very excellent director of science fiction films, and has earned a place with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg among my favorite directors. Without him helming this film, i think this film would have fell over and died just like that 2003 Hulk movie, which failed because of choosing the wrong director for the job, Ang Lee, while he is a fantastic director super hero films are not his thing and it shows in the film. Well All an All, Star Trek Into Darkness may not be anywhere close to being as good as the first film, it does make it into the fresh list, with the help of a solid addition to the cast, Benedict Cumberbatch, excellent visuals, and great direction this Star Trek sequel holds up to expectations.

Evil Dead," Alittle too Gory, but still a great horror film with excellent acting from Jane Levy.
","One of the better horror films that have been released and one of the better films of the year. Evil Dead, is disgusting and a bit few on character development and contains a few questionable acts from the characters, but is mostly good. Evil Dead is fun, gory, exciting, scary, and just contains a fresh cast of faces that you cheer on till they die. Or live... The film might be a bit to gory but is helped by Jane Levy who is a star in the making. Her performance sent chills through my body. I got a sense of a new Jamie Lee Curtis in her, agree? This was well directed and while a bit dumb minded still good. The character development is a bit poor but we get to know the characters at least a little before they meet there ends. One of the better horror films and one of the better films of the year. B",3,10,18,15 September 2013
Jack Reacher," Good Mystery not great but something to watch on a rainy day.
","Jack Reacher, now this was a good mystery, it wasn't anything great, but a film I wouldn't mind owning in the future, Tom Cruise's performance was funny and excellent, the script was solid, great cast, and a few sly laughs, fairly entertaining, above average crime movie by and inch. Just a small film that will be forgotten in time but still good, but the ending was still a disappointment, didn't really excite. The film couldn't really find the right tone. he film shifts between seriousness and comedy. Just doesn't pick one to keep. Tom Cruise really enjoyed making this and you can tell by his excellent performance, you know the kind of performance he usually saves for Mission Impossible. B-",7,1,3,15 September 2013
Looper," Puts characters in right place, and looks good. Still not a big success story
","This film was really an interesting film to watch. And I mean it. When it was released back in September 2012, I had no such interest in watching it. For me the film just looked lame. I know you should never judge a book by its cover; I was just totally uninterested in this film. For starters it had that gangster's vibe going for it. And I just don't like gangster movies, for one and the fact that it involved killing people randomly, which I like, but this film kind of (for me) seemed to go over the edge and get a little too extreme. When I watched it, it had a very realistic and dark thing about it. What got me threw it all was the mesmerizing performances, by lead Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and supporters, Noah Segan and Emily Blunt. Okay so the issues with this film include Bruce Willis, length, and ending. Bruce Willis. The man behind Die Hard. I don't know what to say, the guy has lost it. He just can't act anymore, why he does it most likely now is to put food on the table. Whenever he's on screen he just doesn't seem to be n it, he doesn't have the same momentum he used to have. The dude unlike Sylvester Stallone just can't do it anymore. He's given up trying. His scenes were very poorly acted. The length of this film is way too long. I can think of a couple of scenes that should have been cut, or shortened more. It's just way too unbearable. This film could have made for a decent Hour and a half film, but instead the people behind it added un- necessary additions to the film such as the half naked women in the bed scene, and the 'kid blue' getting his knuckles cracked scene. Those were lengthy additions that made little difference to the story. The ending to this film was also a bit of a disappointment for me. It ended with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character killing himself so that the crazy future him, Bruce Willis wouldn't kill the kid. It was a very poor ending. The kid should have just been killed and Levitt's character ending it by killing the future him. The kid was freaking nuts, and would end up being a ruthless killer. The kid killed people, he was already a lost cause, and Emily Blunt's character man was she a freaking air head. She should have killed the son. Heck with it, I would have, he was nuts. Well now to the good things. It includes the acting, special effects, and character development. The acting as I already explained was very good. Memorable you could say. Joseph Gordon-Levitt nails another role in the head. He is most likely one of the best actors of today. Every film I see him in is more un- forgettable then the last! He is excellent in his role, and adds depth to his character. And a few supporting cast members as I've already stated were excellent as well. The special effects, while minimal, are excellent and sharpened to the tip. The character development is by far the best thing. All of the character's back stories are told neatly and well. All of the character's had an emotional back story, and you felt something for each one, good and bad. You felt their issues and problems, big and small. Every character was proved to be realistic and had something about them that at least one person could relate to. All in All, Looper might not be a big success, but it puts its characters in the right place and just seems realistic, and emotional. C+",6,1,2,24 June 2013
