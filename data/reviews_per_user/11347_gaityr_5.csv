Casablanca," A film for everyone, even 'As Time Goes By'...
","How does one even begin to describe CASABLANCA? I know that there's nothing I can say to improve its reputation, or to make it any more well-loved. All I can attest to is the fact that I had the chance to see this film for the first time today, and just couldn't help falling in love with it. It's as close to perfect as a romance film could get, with elements of war, action, suspense, and good old-fashioned friendship thrown in to spice things up a little.(Summary contains spoilers, beware!) It's war-time, and Casablanca is en route to America and freedom. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), cynical and crusty owner of Cafe Americain, hides a softer, wounded side beneath his tough exterior. He says many times that he's never going to stick his neck out for anyone, that it's a policy of his not to drink with people in his cafe--all things that change when Isla (Ingrid Bergman) comes back into his life, unfortunately accompanied by her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Victor is a top man in the resistance movement, and needs desperately to escape to America to continue his fight for freedom. CASABLANCA isn't all about politics, however. It really comes down to the love of Rick for Ilsa, whom he met for a heady love affair in Paris, all set to the tune of 'As Time Goes By' (surely one of the most beautiful and memorable love songs ever written). His choice is the most difficult one anyone could ever be expected to make, and what's good about the film is that it keeps the audience guessing, even to the end, about just what Rick will do with the power he has over the fate of Ilsa, and most importantly, Victor (and as the film would have us believe, the free world!). I dare your heart not to break when Rick tells Ilsa, as he so famously does, 'Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.' And then one realises just what war can do to people, and what people can do in spite of war.It's a fantastic film to be discovering for the first time, since the directing, acting and script are all first-rate. Michael Curtiz pulls the entire film together beautifully, drawing an incredible performance from Humphrey Bogart (perhaps the only actor--aside from Spencer Tracy--who could come off as so apparently self-centred and cynical and yet reveal a believably vulnerable side) and capturing Ingrid Bergman in all her luminous beauty. The supporting cast is brilliant, especially Claude Rains as the parallel character to Bogart's Rick, Captain Louis Renault. He certainly rivals Bergman for screen-time, and justifiably gets the lion's share of the good lines. Moreover, the screenplay is one of the most oft-quoted ones ever written, and for good reason: you just don't get dialogue like this anymore, in any film, and it's a treat to be allowed to listen in on the lives of these characters. CASABLANCA is often described as one of the best films ever made as well as one of the best-loved. Its reputation is fully deserved. Watch this for yourself to find out why!",9,1,1,15 August 2002
12 Angry Men," An acting and writing tour de force!
","12 ANGRY MEN is quite simply a film masterpiece. You might not know it from the description--12 jurors who are complete strangers to one another are collected in one room to decide a murder case. 11 believe the defendant, a young boy from the wrong side of the tracks and living in the slums, is guilty, beyond the shadow of a doubt. The last one, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), believes there is a reasonable doubt about the boy's guilt. How Juror #8 eventually gets the other jurors on his side is the point of the entire film, and it almost entirely takes place in the one small room. Hardly splashy, with no special effects--just 12 actors, a script, and the camera.
Sounds boring? This film is anything but. Reginald Rose writes a great story, and though you sometimes get the feeling that this film is meant to be a play, that's largely due to the slightly claustrophobic feel of having the entire proceedings of the film take place in one room. Works for a play, but in a film, one expects cuts to other places, wider shots etc. Still, even this counts in favour of 12 ANGRY MEN, because it forces one to concentrate on the case, the dialogue, the actors, the characters. Of course the film is talky. There's hardly any action. But it couldn't be more well-paced or timed. In fact, it's exciting, in its way. Every time a new vote is called, every time a vote changes to 'not guilty', the audience feels the triumph of something, some 'je ne sais quoi'. Director Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of manipulating the black and white medium he chose for this film, making the film timeless (even more so than the 1997 TV remake with Jack Lemmon in Fonda's role--yes, the jury is no longer one of '12 Angry White Men', but colour still dates a film in a way black and white doesn't). The character study is really what makes the film: you'll recognise everyone in that jury room, from the non-strident nonconformist (Henry Fonda) through to the man who has such great difficulty separating his personal emotions from the facts of the case (a stunning Lee J. Cobb). There's the bigot (Ed Begley) who realises that his words will always fall on unsympathetic ears; the flighty guy who just wants to get to his baseball game (Jack Warden); the shrewd old man who shouldn't be discounted just because of his age (Joseph Sweeney); and the stuffy intellectual (E.G. Marshall) who isn't too uptight to change when he realises he's wrong. That's only half the cast of characters in this film, and aside from the rather unfortunate foreman or Juror #1 (Martin Balsam), every single character is well fleshed-out and a believable person. You can understand the reasons why they change their votes; it's all perfectly within character. Quite an accomplishment, to bring to life 12 men in the space of one and a half hours. Much credit, of course, must go to the writing of Rose for real, credible characters and dialogue. One remains riveted to the film even though it's mostly talk and no action; that's surely an indication of how great the writing and acting in 12 ANGRY MEN is.Henry Fonda does a fine job as the man who initially stands alone with his own reasonable doubt. As usual, he underplays his character rather than grandstanding it, thus allowing for his fellow actors to shine in the showier roles. All of them turn in brilliant performances, but of particular note would be Cobbs, whose final impassioned stand as the odd man out (in a complete reversal of the beginning of the film) is simply stunning. Marshall and Sweeney are excellent in their roles as well. This is most certainly one of the best films ever made: understated, underplayed, but definitely not over-rated. You've heard about 12 ANGRY MEN, I'm sure--so if you haven't seen it, why not? You're missing out on a great script, a great cast, and a great moral about the value of democracy in the American judicial system (one that isn't hammered into the audience--it's made with no self-congratulatory fanfare). Watch this--it's worth it.",9,1,2,5 October 2002
North by Northwest," 'Are you trying to tell me I'm irresistible?'
","How *could* anyone in their right mind resist a screening of NORTH BY NORTHWEST? Not only does it star Cary Grant--still (at age 55) and always one of the best-looking leading actors ever, it's directed by Alfred Hitchcock, co-stars Eva Marie Saint, James Mason and Martin Landau, and has a brilliant script. I'd expected something scary and suspenseful in an atmospheric way, and I *did* get that--but 'North By Northwest' is so much more. It has incredible dialogue, for one thing, played to the hilt by Grant (surely the best and most subtle comedic actor ever). And that's still not all! Comedic element aside, it's also a romance film (check out the scenes between Grant and Saint: some of them border on pseudo-funny, but most of them are electric), an action flick (the scene on Mount Rushmore, the exhilarating cropduster scene), and a good old-fashioned spy thriller. Definitely two of the best hours I've ever spent in a cinema (I didn't want the film to end, and when it did, I didn't want to leave!), and hours I will happily spend again in front of the television, rewatching this film on DVD. 10/10!",10,0,1,25 June 2002
Singin' in the Rain," Musical Perfection!
","The title says it all. It's hard to put my love for this movie into words, quite simply because no description can ever do the film justice. Everything is as it should be: the cast, the music, the lyrics, the dancing, the script and plot... the last is most significant, since with musicals (and movie musicals in particular), you always get the sense that the plot has been skimped on--compromised for the songs that the writer wants to feature in the film. In this film, however, all the songs are part of a whole, and the whole works beautifully.If you watch one movie musical in your whole life, make it 'Singin' In The Rain'. Join Gene Kelly as he dances and whirls through the rain and straight into Kathy's (and the audience's) heart. A classic for the ages.",10,4,7,17 March 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," Still wonderful, 55 years on
","There are many things to rave about in this wonderful classic movie: the competent direction, the detailed creation of a town on a 4-acre lot, the sheer amount of hard work, love and inventiveness that went into its conception and completion.I wish, however, to restrict my rave to the (previously unrecognised) dramatic abilities of the lead actor, James Stewart. If there's one reason to watch IAWL again and again and again (all the other wonderful factors notwithstanding), it's for the amazing performance Stewart turns in as George Bailey. The nuance and subtlety captured in the actor's performance is wonderful, just as the desperation he shows at the end of the film when he's running through Potterville looking for traces of his old life. Watching Stewart play college-age at the beginning of the film takes a little getting used to, but it's the end of the film that truly establishes him as one of the finest actors of his generation. His performance is an absolute marvel, and just as it's a crime that Cary Grant never received an Oscar for his amazing work, the fact that Stewart didn't win an Oscar for this shows how meaningless award ceremonies can be. A beautiful, heartwarming movie. 9/10.",9,1,4,12 February 2002
