10 Cloverfield Lane," Couldn't Be Better
","If you saw the first 'Cloverfield (2008)' and are expecting this to be a sequel, think again. There were times when me and my family were watching this when I actually questioned whether or not this film was even related to 'Cloverfield (2008)'. But it is. As J.J. Abrahams said, 10 'Cloverfield Lane (2015)' is very much '... a blood relative to Cloverfield'.'10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)' is the directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg and stars Marry Winstead, John Goodman, and John Gallagher Jr. Normally, it would be at this point in the review that I would give a brief synopsis of the plot of the movie, but I'm a huge fan of the ad campaign in that is kept the movie an utter mystery. It is best experienced when you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.This movie grips the audience by the throat and doesn't let go. With incredible performances from its cast, and, in my opinion, the best performance of John Goodman's career. I'm keeping this review short because I really don't want you to know anything else, just watch it for yourself. It's a hell of a ride.",9,9,18,11 March 2016
Fight Club," The Perfect Movie
","Movies absolutely do not get any better than this. This is one of the best book-to-movie adaptations of all time, to the point where the author of the novel that it is based off of says that it is an improvement on his book.Fight Club is a uniquely dark (but no tat all depressing) film that immediately pulls you into its world with well written narration that shows you an interesting perspective on the world as we know it. This perspective comes from the main character (no, I'm not going to say his name) who happens to be a narcoleptic, insomniac, middle class man with an OK desk job at a car company. The story takes a turn for the interesting when he befriends a strange yet interesting man names Tyler Durden. The two become great friends and later form 'Fight Club'; a club made up of men who feel enslaved by consumerism and just want a good outlet. And for the sake of spoilers, that is all I can tell you about the story.As far as movie quality, it is spectacular. The movie has extremely well written and well acted characters, with a spectacular cast that fits perfectly into their roles. The dialogue is amazingly well written and it manages to be funny, witty, and non-clichÃ© at the same time. The story is interesting throughout, without a single dull moment (thanks to David Fincher's directing). The musical score is one of the best musical scores ever written, setting the mood perfectly in every scene and making every moment intense- feeling. And even the little details re noticeably good, like the cinematography, special effects, and even the lighting.But of course, what this movie has become most known for is its ending. I will not spoil anything, but this movie has the most beautiful and satisfying ending that, to this day, I have ever seen in a movie.Overall, I would say that if you enjoy good acting, directing, story, dialogue, and etc, DEFINITELY see this film (as long as you aren't a stuck-up b**** who has no taste in movies like Rosie O'Donnell)",10,0,1,19 March 2015
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Severely Underrated Film
","David Fincher is truly the master of book-to-movie adaptations. And with such a successful and dark book as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo to work with, you'd think that this would be a recipe for success. So what did this movie lack to be so ignored and not talked about by the general public?Nothing. This movie lacked nothing. It is a beautiful display of acting, musical score, cinematography, and directing. The reason that this film is is unfairly underrated is because the wrong audience came to see it.The audience that came to see this movie had never seen a film like this before from David Fincher (because he had never done anything like this before). They came with the wrong expectations and as a result, they were unsatisfied. So what is the 'right' audience?If you are one who likes extremely dark, demented movies that are driven purely by dialogue, disturbing imagery, and great directing and not by action or horror movie scares, then this movie will most certainly not disappoint.",7,1,3,30 April 2015
Logan," A Terrific Finale
","Being a movie pessimist has its perks. Logan is the most pleasant surprise I've had with a movie in a very long time. Everybody and their mother has been grinding their teeth in anticipation for this movie. The expectations were absurd. Me? I saw absolutely no reason to be excited for this movie. Not even the 'R' rating could get me excited, no matter how many times I heard someone claim that the 'R' rating was what they needed to tell a Wolverine story that is 'true to the character'. All I knew were two things. Thing 1: We all know how the previous two solo Wolverine movies went. Thing 2: This was from the director of The Wolverine which was, in my opinion, painfully boring and dull. So I walked into the theater ready to tell all my friends how bad it was and not to get their hopes up.Logan is absolutely beautiful. As bleak and emotionally draining as it is, it's beautiful. It's the first superhero movie in a very long time that treats itself as a movie as well as a superhero movie. It's a drama and a character study of Logan. A man who's spent his entire life pushing people away and watching as all the people he ever loved or cared about die one by one. From the beginning, Logan is a very sober experience. Along with the knowledge that almost all the other mutants are dead (including all of the X-Men apart from Logan and Charles Xavier), it's also weirdly sad to see how Logan and Charles have aged. Logan's hair is all gray, Charles is senile. Maybe it's only because of the fact that there are eight other X-Men movies behind it, but another thing this movie seems to have down very well is a world that feels very alive and lived in. Like things have happened. And on top of all of this grim but wonderful detail, Logan even goes to the effort to have a good plot. It would have been so easy to have some throwaway mustache-twiddling villain who's out to end all mutants and blah blah blah and Logan has to stop him (yes, I know it's based on a comic and the story existed beforehand), but this movie really outdid itself with a plot that's engaging and extremely compelling. And to top it all off, Logan is in no hurry to set up another X-Men movie and thus it tells a much more complete story. I only wish the other two solo Wolverine movies could've been this good. Logan is an absolutely wonderful finale.",7,0,3,8 March 2017
Heat," A Timeless Film
","Enough just can't be said about this movie. Heat is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's a nearly three hour crime epic that simultaneously leaves you wanting more and makes you feel completely satisfied. There is really nothing about this film that isn't perfection. The story unfolds beautifully, never dragging. The characters all feel fleshed out, and the actions of every character effect the stories of every other character. On top of this the performances are all as great as you'd expect from a cast like this one. The dialogue is cool, fast, and entertaining without falling into the trap of needing constant one-liners or jokes to keep the audience engaged. It'd be a sin not to mention the score which features everything from rock, to electronic, to classical, to choir. All of it beautiful and minimalistic. As far as the technical aspects go, well, it's a Michael Mann crime thriller. Every scene is shot and lit to perfection. Mann's style is so distinct because of how his films manage to be incredibly stylized and realistic at the same time. No eccentric camera movements, no cool editing tricks, and no cute transitions. Just perfectly executed storytelling. Heat is an absolutely timeless film.",10,1,3,15 March 2017
