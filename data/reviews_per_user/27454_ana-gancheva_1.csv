Skyfall," Do yourself a favor and watch Skyfall!
","I have to say, this movie was not what I expected. I enjoyed it only once but it's impact remains. Kudos to the producers, you have taken the Bond series to another plain, much more intricate and enchanting. I recently watched Die Another Day with Pierce Brosnan and I couldn't help but notice movies back then (just 2002, not that far away) portrayed James Bond as an invincible character, that is in control in any situation, no matter how absurd (think of Icarus chasing him over virgin ice on the North Pole, conveniently stopping from killing him just so he can pull out a para planner and something that looks like a surf board). Now, Pierce Brosnan makes one amazing Bond, I have nothing bad to say about him! But I will admit I do LOVE the new approach with Daniel Craig - sophisticated, yet still human. You know, think of that scene with the chair in Casino Royale...Skyfall was different for me, because Bond chose to stay away... he would rather be in Turkey, middle of nowhere, than making a difference. NEVER does Bond abandon his Country, his Queen or MI5! We definitely have a different perspective of his character, he still is that amazingly charming, secretive and seductive Bond, but with an edge. It shows a vulnerable side of him, but even in his 'weakest' moment he is still able to save the world.So far, no Bond girl has ever been .... removed from the movie in the middle of it. Naturally, I presumed to see Severine live and be saved by Bond, yet we see another twist in this movie, another motivation for Bond to make things right. I wish Bérénice Marlohe starred till the end, she makes one striking Bond girl.I did not expect not expect to see M die at the end of the movie.... I came to appreciate her strong, to-the-point righteous character, seeing her go almost brought tears to my eyes. Almost. I can still see her order that shot, knowing Eve is never going make it. There are so many forces at play, James is but a figure on her chess board. Best figure non-the-less! To me Daniel Craig is the GREATEST Bond ever. He is one amazing actor, I really enjoyed his permanence in Archangel. I hope he remains James Bond.",9,21,34,23 December 2012
