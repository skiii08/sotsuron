The Finest Hours," Inspiring movie and FAMILY friendly!
","I was surprised Walt Disney still produced a quality movie. Our whole family enjoyed it. We especially liked the fact that it was based on a true story. Folks kept their clothes and and every other word wasn't F this and F that. Self reliance and individuality was stressed instead of this over sensitivity and relying on group think. What some may not like is the respect shown towards rules and knowing when to over rule the rules. Gender roles are clear and defined i.e. women are women and men are men. Gasp,they even allowed praying in those days! It's the America we need to get back to in stead of this third world anything goes mentality. If you were not aware of the plot, you really couldn't predict the ending. There was suspense and the special effects were pretty good. It was very enjoyable. Thank you Disney! Produce more like this and we'll come back to being Disney fans.",10,3,6,5 February 2017
