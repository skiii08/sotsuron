Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Weak
","Not only was this movie not the equal of the Star Wars trilogy, it wasn't even a good movie.  I liked the very beginning of the movie with the Jedi Knights running around, but after that the story was fragmented and not very exciting.",5,0,1,16 July 1999
