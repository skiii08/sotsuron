Skyfall," Disappointing and patchy
","It's not as bad as QoS, which I thought was inept and dull. It's nowhere near as good as Casino Royale.I find it odd that many reviewers, with usually high standards, have apparently become blind to some quite obvious clangers in this film.The stereotype would be that a Bond film doesn't need to be smart, it can be cheesy. I'd disagree, the best Bond films - Goldfinger, Live and Let Die, Casino Royale, OHMSS - yes, they do have all the usual staple Bond scenes (Casino, Q gadgets, car chase, bond girl) - but they can still put it into a package which is not cheesy.Some bits which jumped out:<ul><li>Bond goes to the casino and is told he won't leave alive. He beats the stuffing out of the 3 baddies and Moneypenny hands him the suitcase of money ... and then just casually strolls out. This is a casino on an Island. There's no other security at the casino to bother him? He just has to dispatch 3 people and then that's it?</li></ul><ul><li>It's revealed to us that Ralph Fiennes' stuffy office-bound M used to server in Ireland up against the IRA. Cue groans when he duly grabs a pistol and starts kicking butt when the MP's committee is assaulted. This reminded me a bit of the Independence Day Vietnam-Vet-President stepping into a fighter plane</li></ul><ul><li>The Disk of agents that is being leaked ... What happened to that?</li></ul><ul><li>Major clunky dialog exposition. Q: I'm not ready to do .. M: 'Well seeing as you've just overseen a failure whereby our agents details have been leaked and lots of Nato people are now at risk (insert plot exposition here)... '</li></ul><ul><li>Bond goes back to the estate .. and his old mentor turns up to offer wise words and home-truths, like some kind of Karate Kid mentor. Groan ...</li></ul><ul><li>Did Q really have to point out explicitly that Bond failed the tests. Surely we'd figured that out already? It's another example of clunky exposition that cheapened the experience</li></ul><ul><li>Bond going to Scotland in the old Aston Martin. Huh? He is allowed to keep his old gadgets or something? That's ridiculous. So then this was just crow-barred in as a reference to the old Bonds regardless that it makes no sense in the universe of the film... I know that this is not reality but you need to have some sense of consistency otherwise it's just a theme-park film</li></ul><ul><li>Mentor person could pretty much have been written out of the movie and it'd have made no difference</li></ul><ul><li>Fore-mentioned mentor happily wandering into the brush - forgetting to switch his light off and thereby alerting the baddies of his presence. Come on ...</li></ul><ul><li>The whole Rocky type teaching Bond to shoot again stuff. Groan</li></ul><ul><li>The irrational Villain behavior. He can hack any computer in the World... he's a diabolical genius .. but he attacks Bond at the end with a handful of henchmen</li></ul><ul><li>The London tube has been attacked with bombs, a bad guy has escaped from MI6 leaving a trail of dead bodies in his wake .. nobody thinks to let the security know at the MPs committee where head of MI6 is. Q's sidekick is being told to get Q to safety immediately, but hang on, better not interrupt the MP's questions ...</li></ul>I could go on... Shame because there were some really promising bits.<ul><li>Javier Bardem's villain had lots of potential. His introduction is great, but it's downhill from there and he goes from being quite original and chilling to seeming like a sulky child, albeit one with a lot of firepower at his disposal.</li></ul><ul><li>Very well shot</li></ul>You get the idea.",5,7,17,6 November 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Very good addition to the saga - comfortably the best since the original trilogy.
","Coming to this film quite late, only watching it after seeing episode 9 (Rise of Skywalker) at the cinema.Despite having been told by friends that Rogue One was a decent film, my expectations were low.But Rogue One starts well, gets better through the running time, and by the end of the film this 40-something year old was starting to feel a little emotional - boy it's been a long wait for a good Star Wars film. Disney, pay attention: This is how it should be done.The film is not without flaws - the obvious problems are the couple of prominent CGI characters. The CGI on these two is noticeably uncanny. The second of these characters in particular is so jarring in appearance as to really throw you out of the moment. But it's a passing moment towards the end of the film.Immense respect to Gareth Edwards and the writers for crafting a coherent story in the Star Wars Universe, without falling back on the over-done Star Wars cliches, but still somehow keeping very true to the spirit and feel of the saga.Highlights for me:
<ul><li>The final battle; very well shot, genuinely thrilling; brings some menace and exhilaration back to classic Star Wars designs and characters.</li><li>The droid - a genuinely original take on the faithful droid sidekick.</li><li>The main characters - what a pleasure to see heroic characters written with some actual nuance.</li></ul>Thanks Mr Edwards and co. More of this please Disney.",8,0,1,27 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Unoriginal and mechanical exercise in franchise extension elevated by a couple of strong performances and technically impressive set-pieces
","It's basically an enjoyable film but that is a very low bar and easily reached simply by stringing together a few epic set-pieces, executed the bombast and CGI power at one would expect of such a production.But despite all the noise, and seemingly endless narrow escapes, there is very little actual sense of suspense or drama; and most events felt like arbitrary plot devices to set up the next cycle of meaningless quest / jeopardy / narrow-escape.The exceptions to this are the scenes featuring Adam Driver Kylo Ren, who is charismatic, creepy and somehow pitiable all at once; and Daisy Ridley as Rey, who does bring a bit of steel and charisma to a character who risks coming across as rather boring.I also do not welcome the Lord-of-the-Rings-ification of the Star Wars Universe. I was half expecting a dragon and couple of Orcs to appear at times.Saw this with my six year-old son. At one point he said 'Ugh, not *another* planet'... Nailing quite well the apparently interminable planet-hopping. From the mouths of babes...",3,6,10,20 January 2020
Zero Dark Thirty," Overrated, hollow.
","Given the various plaudits bestowed on this film around about it's release I was expecting a lot more.The biggest surprise to me was Jessica Chastain's performance and character. She was guilty at times severe over-acting; e.g. frantic am-dram gurning, snarling, and shaking to telegraph 'I AM ANGRY NOW' - in a way that felt quite unnatural.For a film which sets itself out to be unflinchingly serious, the dialogue was sometimes quite corny. For example, the exchange between Chastain and James Gandolfini; something along the lines of:'Who's she?'
'I'm the m*therf*cker who found the place.'
'Hey I like the cut of your gib - let's hear what the chick has to say' (groan)I found it difficult to get emotionally involved in the film, since frankly none of the characters are likeable, sympathetic or particularly interesting. I couldn't care less about any of them.The end of the film with the Navy SEALs is by far the strongest part.",5,4,5,2 February 2020
