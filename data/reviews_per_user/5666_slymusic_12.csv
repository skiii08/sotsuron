Vertigo," A truly well-made film!
","'Vertigo' is James Stewart's fourth and final picture under the direction of the Master of Suspense: Alfred Hitchcock. Today, it is quite difficult to refer to this film as anything less than a gem. (If you have not yet seen 'Vertigo,' please DO NOT read any further.) Stewart executes an absolutely masterful performance as San Francisco police detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson, whose crippling vertigo, resulting from acrophobia, has a detrimental effect on his career. (Hitchcock makes great use of a 'reverse zoom' effect, aided by Bernard Herrmann's haunting music score, as the camera aims downward to indicate Scottie's vertigo.) Kim Novak is quite wonderful as Scottie's primary love interest, the supposedly possessed & enigmatic Madeline Elster and the fairly diffident & agitated Judy Barton, both of whom are one and the same. Barbara Bel Geddes is fine as Scottie's very casual girlfriend Marjorie 'Midge' Wood; Hitchcock's light touches of humor in this film primarily involve the various scenes with Scottie and Midge together. Tom Helmore as Scottie's old school chum Gavin Elster is the perfect villain who gets away with the murder of his wife Madeline, and he selects Judy to play the part of Madeline in order to dupe Scottie into believing Madeline committed suicide. One question that sticks in my mind is why Hitchcock would blatantly choose to explain how Scottie has been deceived through a flashback remembrance by Judy.My favorite moments from 'Vertigo' include the following. To begin with, Hitchcock is very clever with the use of light, color, and mirrors to astonishing effect in this masterpiece. Some of the best examples of light are the blurriness in the churchyard, possibly indicating Scottie's confusion as he follows Madeline; the sharp contrast between a dark alley and a bright flower shop; the slow dim as book shop owner Pop Liebel (Konstantin Shayne) tells Scottie & Midge about the mental breakdown & eventual suicide of Carlotta Valdes, who was Madeline's great-grandmother; the silhouette of Judy as she sits on her bed, nervous about having a relationship with Scottie; the brightening of the lights in Ernie's Restaurant when Scottie spots Madeline for the first time; and the emerging of what appears to be Madeline in the darkness of Ernie's before Scottie realizes she is a mistaken identity when she walks further into the light. Some great uses of color include Scottie's chilling nightmare sequence and the somewhat sickening neon green light shining into Judy's bedroom, which is really put to good use when Judy emerges from her washroom as the identical image of Madeline, blurred by the green light. Some examples of mirrors are the reflection of Madeline while Scottie spies on her through the door of the flower shop; the two-shot of Midge and the painting she did of herself (a la 'Portrait of Carlotta') in an attempt to be funny; and the basic fact that Scottie mirrors his own nightmarish life, loving the same woman twice and witnessing her death falling from the bell tower of an old Spanish mission. Scottie's final dramatic moment of angrily frightening the truth out of Judy by forcing her up the stairs of the bell tower is quite an edge-of-the-seat experience. Equally frightening is Scottie's opening scene as he clings for his life onto a roof gutter numerous stories above the ground, his vertigo taking over as a policeman falls to his death in trying to save him. And Scottie's facial expressions are put to good use in this film as he follows Madeline around in an extended driving sequence with not a word spoken; as he suffers from acute melancholia after Madeline's death, frailly spending his time in a rest home unable to speak while Midge tries to comfort him; and as he delightfully witnesses Judy's transformation into Madeline when she walks toward him from the washroom.'Vertigo' is considered to be James Stewart's and Alfred Hitchcock's greatest collaboration, which makes it all the more curious that it did not receive greater recognition when it was first released in 1958. Stewart was undoubtedly at the peak of his craftsmanship in 'Vertigo'; his brilliant characterization of John 'Scottie' Ferguson, as we find out over the course of this picture, is quite obsessive, manipulative, and DARK. In conclusion, Mr. Stewart really worked hard to turn in a frighteningly grand performance under Mr. Hitchcock's masterful direction.",Null,6,7,25 August 2006
Wayne's World," From cable access to the big leagues!
","'Wayne's World,' based on the Saturday Night Live skit of the same name, is the quintessential hilarious party movie. Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey), in addition to narrating the movie, host their own cable access television show that they film in their basement. The plot, which never gets in the way of the multitude of jokes, thickens when a sleazy TV programming director named Benjamin Kane (Rob Lowe) offers Wayne and Garth a huge contract for Wayne's World to be taped on big-network TV. Problem is, Wayne and Garth are not aware until much later of various stipulations in this contract that ultimately hamper their show. Besides, the slick Benjamin becomes Wayne's rival for the affections of Cassandra (Tia Carrere), the electric bassist/lead singer for a rock band known as Crucial Taunt. (If you haven't yet seen this movie, please DO NOT read any further.)Highlights: The original ending of this movie does not appeal to Wayne or Garth, so they provide their own 'Scooby Doo' ending. On the opening Wayne's World show, Garth becomes a victim of the Suck Cut. Wayne, Garth, and their few cronies go cruising in their 'mirthmobile' to the accompaniment of Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'; later, they pull up next to a Rolls Royce and ask for some Grey Poupon. Garth takes a fantastic drum solo at a music store. Wayne's ex-girlfriend Stacy (Lara Flynn Boyle) rides past Wayne and Garth on her bicycle during their game of street hockey, but she doesn't pay attention to where she's going and rams into a parked car. When they arrive in Milwaukee, Wayne and Garth pose as Laverne and Shirley. As Benjamin discusses with Wayne and Garth the idea of giving their sponsor, video arcade owner Noah Vanderhoff (Brian Doyle-Murray), a weekly spot on their show, Wayne and Garth make abrupt segues into commercial advertising. When Wayne and Garth visit Alice Cooper backstage following his concert, Cooper unexpectedly gives them a history lesson. When Garth sees his 'dream woman' (Donna Dixon) at the donut shop, Tchaikovsky's famous 'Romeo and Juliet' Overture can be heard, after which the camera zooms in on Garth and bangs him on the head! As Wayne watches Cassandra perform with Crucial Taunt, he is smitten by her as 'Dream Weaver' accompanies his bliss. Wayne humiliates Vanderhoff by writing some hilarious statements on the back of some index cards and showing them to the television audience. And finally, Wayne and Garth poke fun at the state of Delaware, where I am originally from.'Wayne's World' was released in 1992, the year I graduated from high school. I didn't see the film when it was first released to the theaters, but I did obtain a copy of it on videotape that summer. At the end of the film, Garth declares, 'I just hope you didn't think it sucked,' and I certainly didn't. 'Wayne's World' provides many great laughs throughout, and it is just as funny today as it was back in 1992.",Null,0,1,26 March 2007
Finding Nemo," 'Climb aboard, explorers!'
","'Finding Nemo' is a superb motion picture created at Pixar Animation Studios. Make no mistake about it; this movie boasts quite an exciting adventure story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. That's how wonderful it is! (If you have not yet seen this movie, please do not read the next few paragraphs.) The story is about a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) is snatched away by scuba divers. Marlin meets a friendly, energetic, completely absent-minded blue tang fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), and together they go on a frantic yet thrilling search for Nemo, all the while meeting a host of friendly & unfriendly characters and risking their lives time and again. Over the course of the movie, Nemo learns to believe in himself and his own strength, and Marlin learns, after going on such a long journey all across the vast ocean, to not be so overprotective of his son. In the end, Marlin tells Nemo to 'go have an adventure.' The following are my favorite highlights from 'Finding Nemo.' Marlin and Dory create a game out of dodging an overwhelming crowd of jellyfish. When the French cleaner shrimp Jacques (voiced by Joe Ranft) spins Nemo around in the fish tank, the accompanying accordion music, typifying the Parisian atmospheres, makes this scene that much funnier. There is much commotion in the dentist's office when the helpful pelican Nigel (voiced by Geoffrey Rush) bursts in and distracts both the dentist (voiced by Bill Hunter) and his freakish niece Darla (voiced by LuLu Ebeling) in order to save Nemo from an early demise. The end credits involve practically all of the main marine characters engaging in some funny antics, and the catchy tune 'Beyond the Sea' was an excellent choice of musical accompaniment. No sooner do Marlin and Nemo reunite at the end when a huge net swoops onto a massive school of fish, including Dory, and father & son take on a suspenseful moment by coaxing all the fish to swim downward together. There is a wonderful chase sequence, which is actually more hilarious than dangerous, involving Marlin and Dory against a gigantic Austrailian shark named Bruce (voiced by Barry Humphries), who is initially tame until his uproariously funny moment of smelling blood oozing from Dory's snout; equally hilarious are Bruce's two cronies' attempts to console Marlin and Dory through the torpedo chamber. Nemo almost gets himself killed in the tank when he tries to prove his courage, thanks to Gill (voiced by Willem Dafoe), by stopping the motor in the tank filter. And finally, Mr. Ray (voiced by co-writer Bob Peterson), who is one of my favorite characters in the movie, is quite amusing as a schoolteacher who is overly enthusiastic about his subject matter, especially when he's singing while taking his students on a field trip.'Finding Nemo' is a surefire winner that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's quite obvious that the entire team at Pixar put a tremendous amount of effort into making this picture. Executive producer John Lasseter admitted that he knew 'Finding Nemo' was going to be a smash hit even during its darkest days of production, and he was absolutely right!",Null,0,0,9 March 2006
The Polar Express," 'One thing about trains: It doesn't matter where they're going. What matters is deciding to get on.'
","Directed by the great Robert Zemeckis, with an outstanding music score by Alan Silvestri, 'The Polar Express' is a superbly enchanting motion picture for the Christmas season. Featuring its own unique brand of 'live performance' animation, this movie boasts an excellent screenplay that is filled with excitement, warmth, and good humor. (If you have not yet seen 'The Polar Express,' please DO NOT read any further.) The main character, played by Tom Hanks and voiced by Daryl Sabara, is a little boy (known as 'Hero Boy' in the credits) who, on Christmas Eve night, is invited to join a large group of other children passengers for a ride on the Polar Express train. Destination: the North Pole! Over the course of this exciting (and sometimes PERILOUS) train ride, the Hero Boy befriends a pretty African-American girl ('Hero Girl,' played by Nona Gaye) and a poor, shy, lonely boy named Billy (played by Peter Scolari and voiced by Jimmy Bennett), who claims that Christmas has never been a happy time for him. Together, the Hero Boy and Hero Girl help Billy to understand the joy of Christmastime, all the while the Hero Boy finally learns to permanently put aside his own doubts about Santa Claus.My two favorite characters in 'The Polar Express' are the Hero Girl and the train conductor. The girl is such a sweet, lovable young lady with a joyful, generous spirit. She particularly has a deep affection for Billy and truly wants him to have a wonderful Christmas. The conductor (marvelously played by Tom Hanks) is also someone I consider highly admirable, particularly in his interactions with the Hero Boy & Girl. True, the conductor may need to be a stern disciplinarian at times, but I never have any doubts about his warm heart. This is a man who truly cares about all the children passengers and their safety on the trip.And now, here are my favorite highlights from this very charming movie. The lively song 'Hot Chocolate,' sung by the conductor, accompanies a group of waiters & chefs performing some of the most unbelievable acrobatics as they serve hot chocolate (without spilling one drop!) to all of the passengers; even the conductor gets to join in on the acrobatic fun! The Hero Girl's train ticket does some rather extensive travelling all by itself; after flying out the passenger car window, the ticket flies in the air, lands on the snow-covered ground, flies again with a pack of running wolves, gets snatched by an eagle, gets spit out by a baby eagle, lands on the ground where it becomes a giant snowball, flies underneath the locomotive, and winds up back inside the same passenger car! Terrible danger strikes the Polar Express train as it travels at uncontrollably high speeds up and down what is, in effect, a very steep roller coaster, with the conductor and the Hero Boy & Girl at the very front of the locomotive! A little later, the train swerves and slides dangerously across a massive glacier that has completely frozen over the train tracks! My absolute favorite scene in the entire picture, and one that never fails to bring a little tear to my eye, is that of Billy and the Hero Girl together singing 'When Christmas Comes to Town.' Shortly after that, we hear a children's chorus singing the lively 'Polar Express' theme as the train merrily chugs along; the conductor becomes a little teary-eyed when the train arrives at the North Pole with five minutes to spare! For a light touch of humor, as the Hero Boy, Hero Girl, and Billy explore the town where Santa's elves live & work, the threesome becomes aware of a few Christmas phonograph records that keep skipping. When the Hero Boy meets Santa Claus (again played by Tom Hanks), Santa tells him that although a sleigh bell is an important symbol of the spirit of Christmas, the TRUE spirit of Christmas exists in the boy's heart. And for one more little humorous touch, several instruments in the elves' rock-and-roll band require two or more elves to play each of them.'The Polar Express' is a magical movie full of joy and delight for the Christmas season. The Hero Boy ultimately learns that all people who truly believe in Santa Claus will hear the ringing of the symbolic sleigh bell.",Null,0,3,16 June 2007
Duck Soup," Anarchy with a capital 'A'!
","'Duck Soup' is considered by many to be the best film comedy the Marx Bros. ever made, and even though it is not one of my personal favorites, I do enjoy it very much. This boisterous political satire is absolutely rife with visual gags from Harpo and verbal humor from Groucho & Chico. The plot of 'Duck Soup' is quite negligible: the fun-loving Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) becomes the newly-appointed dictator of Freedonia and, just for kicks and giggles, declares war on the neighboring Sylvania. The wealthy widow responsible for Firefly's appointment is none other than Gloria Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), who mistakenly envisions Firefly as the epitome of virtue and refinement. Later on, Firefly attracts the attention of two dimwitted Sylvanian spies named Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), who eventually join forces with him.My favorite scenes from 'Duck Soup' include the following (but please do yourself a favor and watch this classic film first before you read on). To begin with, who could forget the classic 'trick mirror' scene between Firefly and Pinky? Firefly oversleeps and arrives late for his inauguration as dictator of Freedonia; he wastes no time at all insulting his sponsor Mrs. Teasdale with a barrage of puns, and he sings a wacky song that explains how he intends to run the country. When Pinky rides through the streets on horseback as Paul Revere, he suddenly spots a young lady undressing in front of a window; the musical accompaniment shifts abruptly from the 'Light Cavalry Overture' to 'Ain't She Sweet.' Chicolini and Pinky go through a good deal of verbal and visual gags during their initial secret conference with Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern). While inside Firefly's conference room, Firefly offers Chicolini a job as his secretary of war, but first they exchange a few 'important questions'; Pinky later drops in and shows Firefly a series of tattoos, some of which are animated! And finally, Chicolini and Pinky get the better of an infuriated lemonade vendor (Edgar Kennedy) by playing a silly little hat game; Pinky later sticks his bare legs and feet into the lemonade tank, thus driving all the customers away.As wonderful as 'Duck Soup' is, it's a shame that it doesn't feature a piano solo from Chico or a harp solo from Harpo. In addition, even though the film runs a brief sixty-nine minutes, it does tend to drag during the final battle scene. But these issues are very minor considering 'Duck Soup''s status among all the various classic film comedies. This is a film that simply cannot be ignored.",Null,2,3,21 November 2006
Ocean's Eleven," 'You do the math.'
","Eleven men convene to pull off the greatest con in the history of Las Vegas: lifting three casinos (the Mirage, the MGM Grand, and the Bellagio). This becomes the monumental task for 'Ocean's Eleven', masterminded by Danny Ocean. Danny and his right-hand man Rusty 'Russ' Ryan assign the remaining nine men various jobs based on their individual specialties. The owner of the casinos is the merciless Terry Benedict, with whom Danny's ex-wife Tess is now in a relationship. The degree of risk in this grand heist is all too great; one tiny mistake or one lapse of concentration can cause the whole scam to backfire. Assuming everything goes according to plan, the numerical figure is just above $160 million.The casting of 'Ocean's Eleven' could not have been any better! The handsome George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, and the beautiful Julia Roberts plays Tess; their sharp, witty dialogue exchanges are invaluable. The dignified Andy Garcia brilliantly portrays Terry Benedict, 'the enemy'. Not to mention Brad Pitt as the constantly-eating celebrity-poker instructor Rusty Ryan; Matt Damon as the skilled pickpocket Linus Caldwell; Shaobo Qin as the limber Chinese acrobat Yen; Elliott Gould as the swaggering big-shot financier Reuben Tishkoff; Carl Reiner as the convincing flimflam man Saul Bloom; Bernie Mac as the suave blackjack dealer Frank Catton; Don Cheadle (uncredited, for some reason) as the British explosives expert Basher Tarr; Eddie Jemison as the unnerved surveillance expert Livingston Dell; and Casey Affleck & Scott Caan as 'white trash' bickering twins Virgil & Turk Malloy, drivers/bellhops/valets/bodyguards/paramedics/'balloon boys'/etc.My favorite moments from 'Ocean's Eleven' include the following. Near the end of the picture, Danny's ten comrades walk toward the famous Bellagio fountains and watch the show, to the accompaniment of a beautiful piece of music by Claude Debussy. After squeezing his small, flexible frame inside a cash cart, Yen shows his appreciation to Russ for offering him a magazine. Danny and Linus nervously strap themselves to the top of the vault elevator shaft, which is rigged with motion sensors. When Danny and some of his crew arrive at the California Institute of Advanced Science (in order to steal a 'pinch'), Linus expresses disgust at having to remain inside the van with the Malloy twins; having had enough of their quarreling, Linus escapes the van and enters the building, only to be chased by security, forcing him to jump from the roof onto the van. At Reuben's gaudy residence, Danny explains to his crew the layout of the entire scam, illustrated by computer animation. A tense moment occurs when Danny and Linus prepare to blow up the vault door while Yen's bandaged hand is stuck in the door from inside the vault! The brief blackout causes a massive free-for-all in the boxing ring and on the casino floors. During the celebrity five-card draw game, Topher shows his hand: 'All reds!' And finally, I love the three flashbacks as Reuben describes to Danny & Russ the top three failed casino heists.In closing, I cannot write a commentary of 'Ocean's Eleven' without expressing my highest praise for the brilliant music score of David Holmes. The music keeps the picture driving along at a respectable pace and keeps the audience interested. Some of my favorite musical moments from this film include: Danny exiting the prison during the opening credits; Linus' first appearance in the subway; Livingston disguised as security personnel infiltrating the casino security hallways and eventually losing his way; the 'S.W.A.T. team' leaving the casino carrying the bags of money; Linus jumping onto the van from a rooftop; the end of the lunch scene at Reuben's residence, leading into Frank Catton's migration to Vegas and the introduction of the Malloy twins; and finally, 'Caravan' and 'Blues in the Night' accompanying the respective introductions of Yen and Saul. What a fantastic music score!",Null,1,1,6 May 2009
Back to the Future Part III," 'Is this a holdup?' 'It's a science experiment!'
","'Back to the Future Part III' is an exciting conclusion to the entire 'Back to the Future' trilogy, of which I am a huge fan. Writer/director Robert Zemeckis and writer/producer Bob Gale deserve my utmost praise for the commendable job they did with all three movies. So do Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, and (strictly in 'Part III') Mary Steenburgen for their superlative acting. (If you have not yet seen any of the trilogy, DO NOT read any further.) The basic premise of 'Part III' is that Marty McFly (Fox) must travel back to the Wild West in the year 1885 in order to save Dr. Emmett L. 'Doc' Brown (Lloyd) from being shot by the notorious gunman Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Wilson), who happens to be the great-grandfather of Biff Tannen (Wilson again), Marty's arch nemesis from the first two movies. While in 1885, Doc falls in love with schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Steenburgen), with their common interests being a love of science and a fascination with the writings of Jules Verne.My favorite highlights from 'Back to the Future Part III' include the following. Obviously, the most thrilling sequence in the picture is the perilous train ride back to the future! At the film's conclusion, Doc summarizes the whole trilogy by telling Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) that their future is whatever they make it. Upon first arriving in 1885, Marty panics as he speedily drives the DeLorean time vehicle away from a Native American attack and then witnesses an exciting charge of the U.S. Cavalry! Marty tries to escape Buford and his gang from a saloon but is easily overpowered as Buford ropes & drags him to his potential hanging site. At the climactic shoot-out, Marty replaces his handgun with his fists in order to defeat Buford. And at the Hill Valley Town Festival (probably the most fun scene for the cast & crew to film), one of the lively dance tunes we hear is actually the ZZ Top hit 'Double Back.' Doc mentions in 'Back to the Future Part III' how he wishes he had never invented his DeLorean time machine, claiming that it has caused nothing but trouble, but in reality, Doc is wrong. In the end, Doc avoids being shot by Buford, marries his sweetheart Clara, and raises two kids with her, along with his ever faithful dog Einstein. As for Marty, over the course of the trilogy he not only greatly improves his family life but also learns not to lose his cool whenever someone calls him a derogatory name such as 'chicken.' Overall, the entire 'Back to the Future' trilogy is so well done that I am still enchanted whenever I watch it. And no, there doesn't need to be a 'Back to the Future Part IV' in my opinion, since I truly believe the epic is very well told & developed in the three already-existing movies.",Null,0,0,12 June 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," A true classic if there ever was one
","What could I possibly write about 'It's a Wonderful Life' that hasn't already been written? It is my favorite film starring my favorite actor James Stewart. Beautifully directed by Frank Capra, it is a masterpiece about the joys and trials of everyday life, and its main lesson is the fact that nobody is born to be a failure and that everybody is important. A struggling man named George Bailey (Stewart) sees life pass him by as he forgoes his opportunities to travel the world, go to college, and do all sorts of outstanding things. George considers himself a failure and never realizes what a great man he is until he meets his guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers), who shows him how different many people's lives would have been had George never been born.'It's a Wonderful Life' contains such an outstanding cast that it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing these parts so effectively. Frank Capra had only James Stewart in mind for the all-American George Bailey, and he could not have made a better choice. Not to mention Donna Reed as George's sweet, comforting wife Mary; Lionel Barrymore as the cold, Scrooge-like Mr. Potter; Thomas Mitchell as the fun-loving, irresponsible Uncle Billy; Henry Travers as George's lovable, kindhearted guardian angel Clarence; Beulah Bondi as George's warmhearted mother; Samuel S. Hinds as George's caring-about-others-before-himself father; H. B. Warner as the drunken-turned-responsible druggist Mr. Gower; and on and on the list goes. Honestly, no other actors could have portrayed these roles so well.Here are my favorite highlights from 'It's a Wonderful Life,' and there are quite a few. At the end, amidst all the donations and tears of joy at the Bailey residence, the one moment that almost never fails to bring tears to my eyes is George's discovery of the inscription on the inside cover of Clarence's copy of 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer': 'Dear George, Remember NO MAN is a failure who has friends. Thanks for the wings! Love, Clarence.' George displays his darker side when he both yells at Uncle Billy for misplacing the $8,000 and lashes out at his family shortly thereafter. James Stewart's initial appearances in this film serve as a reminder of his prewar all-American image, particularly when George describes the giant suitcase he wants for his European tour, or when he talks quietly with his father at the dinner table, or when he confronts the scheming Potter, who threatens to dissolve the Bailey Building & Loan Association after the sudden death of George's father. Arguably the loudest and funniest scene in the picture involves the Charleston dance at the high school gymnasium, during which the floor opens up to reveal a swimming pool below. George and Mary spend their wedding night in the same dilapidated old house that they threw rocks at years ago, but the music and the candlelight dinner are just right (as actor Tom Bosley pointed out, if George has had a wonderful life in humble Bedford Falls, to a large extent it was Mary who made it so). Mr. Gower physically abuses young George (Bobbie Anderson) for not delivering a prescription, until Gower realizes what he had put in the capsules! George runs through Pottersville in shock at the unfamiliar buildings and the interesting music filtering through some of them. Upon Clarence's announcing that he is an angel second class, the night watchman (Tom Fadden) falls backward out of his chair! And finally, the film displays its sentimentality right from the opening shots, in which the humble voices of George's family and friends are heard praying for him.'It's a Wonderful Life' is a classic, no doubt about it. I enjoy it not only during the Christmas season but all through the year. James Stewart WAS George Bailey, and he has my utmost praise for such a fine performance. The film was Stewart's and Capra's favorite, and no wonder. Capra was passionate about the story, and Stewart gave it his all after five years of having not appeared in feature films. In short, 'It's a Wonderful Life' is a truly remarkable film.",Null,6,11,30 November 2005
Back to the Future Part II," Quite an astonishing adventure!
","'I don't want to hear anything about 'Back to the Future III.' Just give me g**d*** 'Back to the Future II'!' These words were spoken by the head of Universal Studios when he learned that writer/director Robert Zemeckis and writer/producer Bob Gale had devised not one but TWO fantastic sequels for the original 1985 megahit 'Back to the Future.' Of all three films in this famous trilogy, 'Back to the Future Part II' is my favorite, simply because Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) endures more adventure and more stark terror in this movie than he does in the other two movies. Not to mention the sharp contrast of time periods through which Marty travels in 'Part II.' (If you haven't yet seen any of the three films from the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, please DO NOT read any further.) After the opening credits, Marty visits the future (2015), and then, after a brief sojourn into a nightmarish alternate reality (1985-A), he very quickly winds up back in the past once more (1955). The fact that the screenplay allows Marty to revisit 1955 with a different angle & viewpoint than he had in the first movie is what excited Robert Zemeckis more than anything else about the making of 'Back to the Future Part II.' Zemeckis claims 'Part II' to be his favorite in the trilogy and certainly one of the most interesting films he's ever made.Zemeckis once stated that great directing is great casting, and he is absolutely correct, because with the assembly of a fine cast, the director can be quite sure that he/she will elicit the strongest & most convincing performances from those actors he/she knows to be reliable. Most of the principal players from the original 'Back to the Future' returned for the sequels, except for Crispin Glover. But the absence of Glover turned out to be a minor loss; Zemeckis believes that the sequels turned out fine anyway, and I agree. With actors like Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, James Tolkan, etc., you just couldn't go wrong! My favorite highlights from 'Back to the Future Part II' include the following. The year 2015, as depicted in this movie, involves a great number of astonishing devices & inventions (e.g., wild clothing fashions, flying automobiles, and hoverboards), often just for the sake of a joke! One of the funniest scenes in 2015 involves a shark hologram (from 'Jaws 19') emerging in the air and scaring Marty out of his wits; when the hologram disappears, Marty comments, 'Shark still looks fake.' In 1985-A, Marty climbs through a window into what he thinks is his house, but he soon finds out differently! Shortly afterwards, as a homage to director Frank Capra's 1946 classic 'It's a Wonderful Life,' Marty runs through the town of Hill Valley and finds it to be a trashed, corrupt war zone filled with prostitutes, motorcycle gangs, and drive-by shootings; what really puts the cherry on the cake is Marty's horrified reaction to a TV monitor outside Biff Tannen's Pleasure Paradise that shows Biff (Wilson) being married to Marty's mother Lorraine (Thompson) in 1973. Marty narrowly escapes being shot in Biff's grand casino hotel when Biff learns that Marty knows about the troublesome sports almanac, which has been the cause of Biff's wealth & corrupt power. Back in 1955, Marty relives his big musical moment playing & singing 'Johnny B. Goode' at the high school dance, but in order to prevent his other self from seeing him, he crawls on a catwalk way above the stage and drops a load of sandbags onto Biff's thugs (Casey Siemaszko, Billy Zane, and J.J. Cohen). Shortly after that, in the most amazing double image split I have ever seen, the real Marty is knocked unconscious by a door swung open by Marty's other self. And finally, in one of the most exciting stunts in the movie, Biff tries to shake Marty off his car while Marty holds on for dear life in trying to retrieve the sports almanac.'Back to the Future Part II' may have received quite a number of negative reviews and is probably not the classic that the original movie is becoming. I must admit that I had a difficult time trying to follow & understand everything that was going on in this sequel upon its initial theatrical release. When I watched it on videotape a few years later, I finally understood it and was quite enchanted with all the exciting adventures that Marty and Dr. Emmett L. 'Doc' Brown (Lloyd) experience through their time travels. To me, 'Back to the Future Part II' is simply a remarkable film!",Null,0,1,30 August 2006
Mr. Holland's Opus," 'What an auspicious beginning.'
","'Mr. Holland's Opus' is the story of a musician whose passion in life is to compose great music. But in order to provide for his wife and son, Glenn Holland must take a post as a high school music teacher, which is seemingly the last thing he ever wanted to do. In the thirty-year period of which this story takes place (mid-1960s to mid-1990s), Mr. Holland discovers through his struggles, little by little, student by student, that he indeed has what it takes to become a great teacher and mentor. He applies the entire history of music ('from Beethoven to Billie Holiday to rock-and-roll,' as he expresses it) in order to help his students learn to appreciate what music is and what it has to offer to the world. Of course, Mr. Holland faces some hard challenges along the way, namely the fact that his numerous teaching responsibilities take him away from giving his son, who has a ninety-percent hearing loss, the attention he desires. In the end, when all of the arts programs get dropped from the school curricula, Mr. Holland believes that all of his teaching efforts have been for nothing. It is then, and only then, that he realizes how much of an impact he has actually made on the entire community.The casting of 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is terrific. Richard Dreyfuss was THE actor for the leading role of struggling music teacher Glenn Holland, who experiences life with all of its joys and sorrows through music. Glenne Headly is wonderful as Mr. Holland's loving, reasoning, understanding wife Iris. I highly admire Jay Thomas as phys ed teacher Bill Meister, who strikes up a lifetime friendship with Glenn right at the start of Glenn's teaching career. Not to mention Olympia Dukakis in her top-notch portrayal of principal Helen Jacobs, William H. Macy as vice principal Gene Wolters, Alicia Witt as struggling clarinet student Gertrude Lang, Jean Louisa Kelly as the lovely soprano Rowena Morgan, and Terrence Howard as athletic star/drumming novice Louis Russ.Here are my personal favorite scenes from this heartwarming film. Mr. Holland shows his first signs of success when he convinces the self-conscious Gertrude Lang that playing music is meant to be enjoyable and is 'not about notes on a page'; with this in mind, Gertrude shuns her music stand, closes her eyes, and 'plays the sunset' on her clarinet. Until Rowena Morgan makes her first appearance, the various singers who audition for the upcoming Gershwin revue prove themselves amusing in their interpretations of 'I Got Rhythm'. A tense moment in the Hollands' household occurs when their little boy Cole, deaf and with virtually no communication skills, has difficulty showing his mother what he wants from the cupboard. Rowena sings a beautiful version of 'Someone to Watch over Me', with the orchestra conducted by Mr. Holland, on the last night of the Gershwin revue. Shortly after learning that his son is deaf, Mr. Holland is almost in tears as he describes to his music appreciation class the agony of Beethoven's deafness. Following the assassination of musician John Lennon, Mr. Holland sings a nicely orchestrated version of Lennon's 'Beautiful Boy' and dedicates it to his own son Cole, now a teenager (Joseph Anderson); from then on, Glenn shares a much greater rapport with the forgiving Cole. And finally, Mr. Holland cannot fight back the tears at his high school's surprise celebration of his thirty years as the music teacher; his former student Gertrude Lang, now a governor (Joanna Gleason), makes him aware of all the lives he has touched: 'We are your symphony, Mr. Holland. We are the melodies and the notes of your opus, and we are the music of your life.' 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is a film that I believe offers hope to the many people in this world who are forced to take day jobs for which they have no high regard. As this movie progresses, we come to understand how fortunate Glenn Holland's students are to have him for their music teacher.",Null,9,9,30 June 2009
Rear Window," 'Here lie the broken bones of L.B. Jefferies.'
","'Rear Window' is one of the masterpieces of director Alfred Hitchcock, no question about it! My favorite actor James Stewart, who portrays the wheelchair-bound magazine photographer L.B. Jefferies, claimed this murder mystery to be his personal favorite of his four films with Hitchcock. One might have thought that after Stewart's negative experience in working with Hitchcock on 'Rope' (1948), it was not likely that the two would ever work together again; in fact, 'Rear Window' is a single-set drama just like 'Rope' is, the difference being that 'Rear Window' was an instant success and one of Stewart's biggest moneymakers in the 1950s. (If you have not yet seen 'Rear Window,' please DO NOT read any further.)Hitchcock was a genius not only in casting the picture but also in the way he shot it. James Stewart's characterization of L.B. Jefferies (Jeff for short) is superlative, as Jeff is simply an ordinary man placed in an extraordinary situation. After breaking his leg on a photographic expedition, Jeff is forced to sit quietly in his Greenwich Village apartment during an excruciatingly hot summer and spend his time observing & spying on all of his neighbors across the courtyard. In particular, he focuses quite a bit on the windows of jewelry salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), whom Jeff suspects of murdering his ailing wife after he spies on Thorwald making mysterious trips at odd hours in the night with his sample case and wrapping a butcher knife & a small saw in a newspaper. The way Jeff tacitly uses facial expressions to convey his many reactions to his neighbors' various unfolding dramas is a true sign of James Stewart's skill as an actor. Whenever the camera focuses on the windows of the neighboring apartments, it is almost always from Jeff's perspective, thus we constantly hear indistinct snatches of conversation from the various apartments, and almost all the music we hear in this film comes from within the realm of the set (as when the songwriter, played by Ross Bagdasarian, turns on his radio or plays his piano); as we can conclude, Hitchcock was quite clever in setting these various limitations in order to keep the story captivating. And, of course, what would a Hitchcock picture be without generous sprinklings of HUMOR to break up the tension of the murder story? A majority of the humor stems from, once again, the antics of Jeff's neighbors! In addition to the great James Stewart, the beautiful, enchanting Grace Kelly is splendid as Jeff's fashion-model socialite girlfriend Lisa Fremont, who in short order believes that Jeff's suspicion of murder has credibility. So does Jeff's sharp-tongued nurse therapist Stella, played by the wonderful Thelma Ritter. One person who does NOT take Jeff seriously, however, is Jeff's detective friend Lt. Thomas J. Doyle, smartly played by Wendell Corey. Doyle is so skeptical of Jeff's belief of Thorwald's act of murder that he uses pure logic to try to settle Jeff's suspicions. And finally, there is the murderer himself, Lars Thorwald, brilliantly played by Raymond Burr. From a distance, Thorwald doesn't look so dangerous . . . until he finds out that Jeff has been spying on him! Here are a few of my favorite moments from 'Rear Window.' Once Jeff spots Thorwald wrapping the cutting utensils in newspaper, the close shot of Jeff's eyes is all that the audience needs to confirm that Jeff suspects murder. Jeff creates some humorous friction between himself and Lisa in a rather lively discussion of how different their lives are. Probably the scene that provides the most tension in the picture is that of Jeff helplessly WATCHING Lisa being physically assaulted by Thorwald after she sneaks into his apartment. The close-up of the mean look on Thorwald's face as he quietly enters Jeff's dark apartment is very frightening indeed. And finally, I cannot help but comment on the brilliant Franz Waxman, whose music score at times DRIVES the movie; my favorite musical moments in 'Rear Window' are the bright jazz score with intricate harmonies during the introductory credits, the very GLOOMY score during Thorwald's mysterious sales trips at night in the rain, and the jazz combo in the songwriter's apartment accompanying Lisa rushing over to Thorwald's apartment to slide a letter under his door.'Rear Window' is quite a gem of a movie, a true masterpiece showcasing the genius of that Master of Suspense: Alfred Hitchcock.

Back to the Future," From the present to the past and back!
","From writer/producer Bob Gale and writer/director Robert Zemeckis comes one of the greatest and most beloved films of the 1980s: 'Back to the Future'! This well-made science fiction comedy has become such a favorite among so many people, myself included, that it is on its way to becoming a true classic. The story is just as enchanting today as it was in 1985 when this film was released, and the casting could not have been better.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are absolutely superlative in their respective roles as Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett L. 'Doc' Brown. Marty is a high school teen from 1985 who accidentally powers Doc's time machine, made into a DeLorean, to transport him back to 1955. While in the past, Marty meets Doc's younger self, and one of the most heartwarming aspects of this story is the great rapport between Marty and the 1955 Doc, even though Marty initially has great difficulty trying to convince Doc that he's from the eighties and needs his help to get back to his own time; once Doc is convinced of Marty's honesty and earnestness, he indeed does everything he can to help Marty, and he ultimately succeeds. Credit must also be given to the beautiful Lea Thompson as Marty's mother Lorraine, whose younger self has become dangerously infatuated with Marty; Crispin Glover as Marty's father George, the most pivotal character in the story as he develops courage, with help from Marty, to stand up to some nasty bullies and ultimately win Lorraine's heart; and the congenial Thomas F. Wilson as the mean Biff Tannen, George McFly's arch nemesis.My favorite scenes from this charming movie include the following. At the opening, Marty strums one chord on his electric guitar and gets blown backward by the amplification in Doc's laboratory. Marty accidentally launches himself into 1955 by escaping a pair of Lybian terrorists (who hunt Doc down for stealing their plutonium) and crashing into a barn. Marty first encounters George's younger self at a small diner when Biff and his gang enter and antagonize George; this comically resembles an earlier scene in 1985 when Biff gives George a hard time after totalling George's car. Doc's horrified reaction to a videotape of his older self's mentioning 1.21 jigawatts of electricity is quite unforgettable! Biff and his thugs drive around town chasing Marty on a skateboard, but Marty outwits them and they end up crashing into a manure truck. In one of the greatest pivotal moments of the film, George doesn't realize his own strength when he knocks out Biff in one punch! And finally, at the dance, Marty sits in on guitar and plays a wonderful rendition of Chuck Berry's 'Johnny B. Goode,' but he forgets that he is in the year 1955 and his heavy metal reflexes get the best of him.I don't think there is any doubt that 'Back to the Future' is a truly remarkable film. The direction, the screenplay, the casting, the settings, etc., are all top of the line. Writer/producer Bob Gale commented that there is something about this wonderful story to which everyone can relate; in my case, I can easily identify with George McFly's lack of assertiveness since I was frequently picked on in school. To top everything off, Marty had absolutely no idea what kind of can o' worms he was opening near the beginning of this film when he told his high school principal (James Tolkan) that history was going to change, but when Marty finally returns to 1985 near the end, he realizes how much he has inadvertently changed things for the better!",Null,3,4,5 February 2007
