Minority Report," A very enjoyable Sci-Fi flick
","Rating: 8/10A intelligently made sci-fi movie with a nice combination of action, drama, and suspense.  Tom Cruise proves worthy of the starring role.
The only notable criticism I have is the ending.  While not poorly done, I still felt it could have been crisper.Definitely worth a watch!",8,0,0,25 September 2002
Insomnia," A wonderfully acted film
","The acting in Insomnia is first rate, as one would expect from Pacino and Williams.  The pace of the movie was somewhat tepid at times, but the development of Pacino's character is top notch while the Alaskan cinematography is breathtaking.The predictability of the ending left a little to be desired, but overall an enjoyable and satisfying movie.  Another worthy effort by Christopher Nolan but it doesn't quite measure up to Memento.Rating: 7.3/10",7,0,0,25 September 2002
