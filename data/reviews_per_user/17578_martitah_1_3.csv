Hereditary," Comparing it to 'The Exorcist' is a bit of a stretch!
","In all honesty, I was hoping that the good reviews on this one would actually do the horror genre justice. However, I got disappointed. It seems incredibly difficult to get an horror movie to actually make you lose one or two nights of sleep nowadays. 
The movie could have been better in many ways, I suppose. I mean, the acting is overall good. First of all, it takes a long time for something interesting to actually happen (you almost fall asleep during the first half) and by the time it gets to the part where things start happening, you end up getting disappointed because it's just one or two scenes... One good thing about it is that it doesn't have those predictable jumpscares but stil... 
After watching the trailer (and later the movie) and noticing that they were calling this movie the next Exorcist, I wonder where in the world they saw the similarities. Apart from the demons possessing people, that is... Don't get me wrong but the Exorcist is, for me, the best horror movie of all time. It made me not wanting to sleep and to this day, it is the one I am most afraid of. Hereditary only made me yawn out of boredom except for a couple of minutes...",5,3,6,17 June 2018
Get Out," Get out...of the movie theater
","I decided to watch this movie tonight based on the 8.0 rating and because I'm an horror movie fan.However, to my disappointment this felt more like a comedy because my friends and I spent the whole first half of the movie laughing along with the other people in the room.The second half was predictable and boring. This was something like the 'Stepford Wives' (that movie with Nicole Kidman) and I don't mean it in a good way. Rated it 3/10 only because it made me laugh and because I've watched worse movies in my life, such as, for example, 'Scary Movie 5'. Don't get why it has such high ratings even If the acting is overall good.",3,4,11,6 May 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," 50 Shades of Dreadful
","In all honesty, I was not expecting much of this movie but after watching it, I must add that it was worse than I expected.I have bought the book out of curiosity like many people and didn't like it either.The main problem with the movie itself is that the actors are terrible. Dakota Johnson is slightly better than Jamie Dornan but sill pretty bad.There was something seriously wrong with the cast choice...Jamie and Dakota have zero on-screen chemistry in my opinion and everything about their relationship seemed incredibly forced and predictable. Their 'romantic'adventures are just as exciting as watching a freshly painted wall dry. The other major problem with the movie was that the lines were a mere copy-paste from the book. There was no creativity or imagination when it came to transforming the book into a movie. The line 'Laters,baby' was by far the worst. It was so unnatural that it made it look like the actor was actually reading the script right there rather than acting. The only reason why this movie is selling out theatres around the globe is because people are curious and have no idea how bad it actually is. When the movie was finally over and the lights were on again,everyone in the room was laughing and commenting on about how much of a joke it had all been.Having just said this, I only regret that this is a trilogy and that we're going to have to go through two more films (well, not me anyway,because I won't waste another penny on this). That my friends, is pure torture.",2,7,15,15 February 2015
