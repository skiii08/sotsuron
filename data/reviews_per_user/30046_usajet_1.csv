Resident Evil: Afterlife," What Was Milla Jovovich Thinking?
","I love Milla Jovovich, but this was a horrible movie. She has such great beauty, why would she waste her time with such a horrible movie? I could barely watch 5 minutes of this movie. It tries to be a Kill Bill type effects which is totally wasted with her talent. Is she hard up for money to do such a bad movie? She was much better in STONE which starred Robert DE Niro and Edward Norton. I think she could be a great actress if she held out and got into the right movies.Don't go see this movie - Don't rent this movie - Don't bother watching it on TV.TWO BIG THUMBS DOWN for Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010).",1,1,6,13 March 2011
