The New World," Quite wonderful... as a Silent Movie
","It's surprising to read that so many viewers were bored with A New World. Being both highly interesting and educational, the movie held our interest throughout. At our age, we often fall asleep during movies, but neither I nor my wife lost interest in this well acted story, in spite of its 2Â¼ hour length.The problem for us was the inaudible dialogue, comprised of much whispering and low muttering by the actors as well as an unnecessary and unwanted narrator. The soundtrack (other than a deafening, indefinable roar during the opening and closing of the movie) was beautiful, although it too managed to drown out much of the dialogue. By the end, I was reminded of the silent movie era, when the only sound was that of a theater organ.This movie's shining accomplishment is the rich cinematography, in my opinion highly deserving of the Oscar it was nominated for but strangely, did not win.",8,2,2,30 April 2019
Hotel Mumbai," Powerful, gripping entertainment!
","We just watched Hotel Mumbai, and were on the edge of our seats for the entire two hours. I can't say that about many movies these days, so I consider this a jewel of a movie that I will keep for future viewing pleasure, and to lend to my friends. I don't know how accurate it is in comparison to the actual event, but it serves as a graphic reminder that New York is not the only city to suffer an attack by terrorists. The movie seemed so realistic that it was easy to forget that the characters were acting. Also, we are usually turned off by foreign movies due to the problem of trying to understand the dialog. No problem here. Further, it is strange to see so many reviewers complaining about the violence in Hotel Mumbai. Compared to any of today's action or Western flicks, this one is tame in comparison.",9,2,10,27 July 2019
