50 First Dates," A decent romantic comedy
","Sandler and Barrymore have real chemistry together.....as in the sweet, boy next door / girl next door kind.  They proved it in Wedding Singer, and have done it again. Anyone put off by the walrus jokes and anything else with sexual undertone is just plain prudish. Sandler is certainly a loyal friend to Rob Schneider, but couldn't a bona fide Hawaiian have been recruited to play Schneider's part?  Surely there are humorous, uninhibited Hawaiian men who could have done justice to the role. The Alaska scenery was absolutely breath taking. I liked it; I plan to buy it when the video comes out.",7,0,0,28 February 2004
