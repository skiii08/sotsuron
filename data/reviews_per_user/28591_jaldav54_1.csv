First Man," Melancholy portrayals
",Despite the hype of not showing the flag being planted I found the film focused too much on the home lives of the Armstrong family which appeared to be in a constant state of sadness and gloom. Too little time was spent on the actual trip to the moon and the EVA. When explaining the risks of the mission to his son he seemed as if he was talking to an NASA engineer. Neil's temperament toward his fellow astronauts seemed terse and cold. I think Apollo 13 and The Right Stuff were far more engaging.,3,5,8,26 January 2019
