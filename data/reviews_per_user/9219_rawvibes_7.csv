The Monuments Men," Cozzy Flick
","Just knowing that Hitler had stolen so much art and to see how much he destroyed made this movie worth wild. Although with the caliber of actors in the film , well just to say some Hollywood wood here and there could of picked up the pace and the roles of some of the characters. I think Matt Damon's character was padded a little to much. It took away from the story which is the search of stolen master pieces and to be returned to its rightful place and country. The pace is steady but slow in the parts mentioned. I wished the ending had a longer story to end the story. There's nothing to spoil here. but You know to write a story based on a true story, it should end with stuff like where are they now or passing or people or interviews of people who remember them. stuff like that.",7,3,6,18 February 2014
Ted," Best Comedy Film of 2012
","In a Comedy Film i only give 10s if laugh like I gotta pee from beginning to end. That being said.This in the canvas that Seth MacFarlane needed set aside from TV. This merger of Universal Pictures and Seth MacFarlane will be known for making the BEST COMEDY FILM OF 2012. They tried this type of comedy before with HOP but Universal Pictures was only able to do OK. Even though it was a Easter release. This is Different. It Looks Like a Teddy Bear but sounds like Family Guy with a Unrated mouth. I mean your gonna get a bit of everything. Kool Narration, a beginning, plot and a ending. Its a full package filmGreat acting is seeing Mark Wahlberg (John Bennett)interact with ted like he was a actual human instead of a stuffed bear running with cgi graphic movements. You truly believe they are best buds for over 20 years. Mila Kunis is awesome as (Lori Collins)girlfriend to John. She too plays off the bear so nicely. You have to understand that when the actors act with ted, they are just talking to props or just air. Its like a Saturday Night Live skit that calls for two characters but your the only living actor.You will laugh and you will cry from laughing so hard either way don't be without the thunder buddies in the movie ted.I JUST WISH THEY WOULD SELL THE TEDDY BEAR :( It looks like a Teddy Bear but talks like a Rated R movie Moms",9,2,13,29 June 2012
