The Blair Witch Project," The best hype job ever
","The movie is an interesting idea only occasionally well-executed.  Not only ISN'T it scary, it's not deserving of all the praise being heaped on it or the audience attention it's receiving.  Compared to other 'that could happen to you' films, both Breakdown and Texas Chainsaw Massacre beat the Blair Witch Project hands down.  Which isn't to say it's terrible.  But don't get too excited before you plunk your cash down, either.",6,0,2,23 July 1999
