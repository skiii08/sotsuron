Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worthy of the Name 'Star Wars'
","After seeing the previews for this movie, the visual elements just beckoned me (mostly Darth Maul).  Me and my friend purchased tickets to the 1:00 pm showing of The Phantom Menace, and we were not disappointed.With the intricate storyline set almost a half-century before Episode IV, TPM brought new meaning to the name Star Wars to the young generation. There are stunning special effects, beautiful panoramic views of the CG cities of Theed and Coruscant.  The only thing lacking, in my view, was the soundtrack.Don't get me wrong, John Williams is the king of the orchestra, but I missed the Star Wars theme in the background as good and evil fought to the death.Another minus, is the minimal screen time of the Sith Lord, Darth Maul. His picture is on the action figures, the posters, the calendars, but he is only on screen for a maximum of what, say, twenty minutes, fifteen of it being lightsaber duels.  The devil-Lord has only two lines in the movie, and both are really insignificant.Still on the negatives, it was difficult (for me) to distinguish the difference between Amidala and Padme.  Just when you think you're seeing the Queen talking, BAM! another one steps forward and says, 'No, she's the decoy. I'm the Queen.'  Then five minutes later, 'I'm the actual decoy. She's the Queen.'All of those cons, however, cannot cancel out the great movie.  I enjoyed The Phantom Menace (which is a dumb title), and I think you should definitely go see it.",Null,0,0,20 May 1999
