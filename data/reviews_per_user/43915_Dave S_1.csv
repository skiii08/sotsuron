The Blair Witch Project," Excellent Film! Only reason not a 10 is that I think it will lose alot when it is on DVD or Video
",This is an excellent movie! What stands out for me about this film is its lack of a soundtrack! 'Normal' films have music playing at the beginning and and end of the film. The music helps you drift into a fantasy world and then gently brings you back. This film lacks a soundtrack to help smooth out the transfer of realities. I don't want to dicuss the ending of the film but let me just say that the lack of a soundtrack at the end of the film makes it unique. The Only reason I didn't give this film a 10 is that I don't think it will transfer well onto the home video market...If you are going to see it...catch it on the big screen!,9,1,1,3 August 1999
