Requiem for a Dream," Original and Riveting
","This movie totally disregards what Hollywood says movies should be and shows what film-making CAN be.  It is disturbing, gross, passionate, sexy, and flat out INTENSE!  It made me cry and nauseated.  When I left the theater I felt exhausted.  A completely original film by a GREAT director.  See PI if you haven't already.",10,0,0,15 January 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautifal but..
","The cinematography was outstanding, the movie breathes and glows.  The acting is subtle but very moving.  The fight scenes are absolutely the most incredible EVER put on a motion picture screen, makes the Matrix fight scenes look like Barney vs. Barney.  The flying was taken one step too far. Just like any incredible visual effect, when it is done one too many times in a film it becomes less impressive and begins to chew at the (hesitant to say)'believability' of the act.. I still HIGHLY recommend seeing this in the theaters, very impressive.",9,0,0,24 January 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Style over everything
","Script = Recyled nonsense, Style = John Woo at his best, Tom Cruise = Tom Cruise.  Brainless action with no storyline, but the camera shots, colors, and cinematography is top notch.  The awful script brings it down to 6th grade level though.  Too bad.",5,0,0,15 January 2001
The Matrix," Excellent sci-fi but lazy ending
","This movie is easily one of the top 10 sci-fi/action film ever but c'mon, they can move faster than bullets so the heroes grab GUNS??  Stupid plot point, lazy actually.  The visuals are outstanding and the mystery of 'reality' is the selling point.. the part Keanu was born to play (because he didnt have to act).  8.5/10",7,0,0,25 January 2001
