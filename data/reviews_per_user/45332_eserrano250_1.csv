Iron Man 3," OK but not great.
","So after seeing all the trailers and all the hype for this movie I was very excited to watch this movie. Hearing the Mandarin was going to be the villain made it that much more intriguing for me.I finally went to see Iron Man 3 and let me start off by saying that I'm not that impressed. Don't get me wrong. Robert Downey's portrayal of Tony Stark has become iconic. He clearly owns this character. The direction that was taken as far as Tony having PTSD is also not a bad idea. Although I thought the comedy was a little too heavy, there is definitely a good balance with the action.The story line is where I have the problem. As I said, I think the Mandarin is Iron Man's best villains but in this film he is ruined. There is no mention of the rings of power. The Mandarin turns out to just be a decoy for another villain.All in all, the movie is a good movie to watch but I can't recommend this movie to anyone who is a true die hard comic fan. To the average person who is not familiar with the comics then it will be a great movie to watch.",7,0,2,3 May 2013
