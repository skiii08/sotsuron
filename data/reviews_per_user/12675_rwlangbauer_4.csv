Requiem for a Dream," NC17 ?
","This is one of the few movies that I actually want my nephews and nieces to see.  Some people see this as anti-drug propaganda.  Sorry, I've been there and done that, this movie is very realist.  Why young people can't access this info is beyond me.  Oh! wait a minute John Ashcroft's penis is less than 1'.  What a good reason for public policy.",10,1,2,27 August 2003
Final Destination 2," Failed Potential
","I could almost have liked this movie.  The premise was interesting -- no wonder it has been used in a hundreds of teen horror flics.  The execution was horrible. (Q: What do you think of the director's execution? A: I'm in favor of it!)Peter Weir's The Last Wave takes us to a similiar alternate reality, but despite a lower budget and much less technology, it does so w/ intelligence. The screenwriters and/or the special effects techs that did Final Destination 2 are simply clueless.  I read alot of sci-fi and the trick is that while you can change any aspect of reality, everything else has to be brutally realistic.I will not go into all absurdities that the makers of this film expect us to accept.  They are many.  I'm sure that it started w/ the screenwriter, continued w/ the special effects coordinator and finished w/ the editors. Sure Death can do anything, but making s**t flow up, repetitively, is the last refuge of the incompetent.",Null,0,0,30 July 2003
Blade Runner," Great movie, bad book
","Never try to read 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'  P. K. Dick was certifiably insane and his death was a mitzva.  Admittedly J.K.Rawling has assumed the mantle of 'sf' author not connected w/ reality, but Dick is a tuff act to follow.The movie, however, is completely different.  Scott picked out a few themes from the book that were worth exploring -- and explored them very well. Maybe we should start a program where graduate students in creative writing are assigned to mental health inmates (or under the current administration -- the homeless).Easily one of the best movies ever.  It explores issues that will only become more important as the 21st century developes.",10,0,1,13 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," New Zealand where men are MEN & sheep are nervous
","A truly horrible realization of a terrible book.When I was about 11 my father sat me down and had one of the best father/son talks ever.  It was about LOTR.  I was fixated on the work and in my third or forth rereading.  My father was concerned.  He had spent WWII fighting in the pacific, John Tolkien had spent WWII warm and cozy in Oxford writing drivel.The book is sexist and RACIST & embodies an ethos and morality that are truly objectionable.  Jackson has captured all of this and added an uniquely New Zealand stupidity.RW LangbauerPS(I assume that I am on the Blacklist.  I have never written a spoiler or broken any of the other reasonable rules.  I have pointed out that the IMDB is a sales tool of Amazon.com. Gee, is this a problem.)",Null,2,4,3 June 2004
