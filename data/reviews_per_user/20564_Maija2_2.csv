The Blair Witch Project," Ho Hum
","I think that all the hype ruined it for me.  I was expecting to be scared to death and I think that Mr. Rogers was scarier!  Try not to get sucked into the hype and maybe you will enjoy it more!  Also, if you have ever suffered from motion sickness, bring a barf bag!!  The hand held cameras are a killer!!",3,0,2,25 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Not just for teenagers!
","I went into this movie thinking, it's going to be another teen sex movie, where everyone is sleeping with everyone for no apparent reason except the teenage boys in the audience.  Boy, was I wrong!!  This was a very smart entertaining and funny movie that I hope more people my age (thirty-something) will give a chance, they will be pleasantly surprised.",8,0,0,25 August 1999
