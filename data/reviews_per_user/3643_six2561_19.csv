Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abe Lincoln & vampires.....interesting
","I didn't read the book and I didn't even know there was a book. That being said, I went in with no expectation of liking it. Going by nothing but the title, it sounds dumb and not interesting at all. I really liked this movie. Such an odd combination of Lincoln history & vampires. Who thinks this stuff up? It presents as a serious Lincoln biography, except there are vampires intertwined in the history..! For me , it's what I call mindless summer fun. However, it wasn't mindless and I never found myself bored or not caring or looking at my watch. It's action filled, I connected with the characters, I loved the detail in the costumes and sets. Oh, and ya, there are scary vampires and gory vampire killings. Think of the zombie killings in the TV show The Walking Dead because this is what I was reminded of. More like zombie killings than vampire slaying, but what's the difference anyway and does it matter? No. If you've never seen vampire/zombie gore, you may not like this aspect of the movie. And during the last scene where Henry is asking Abe to consider immortality and the conversation between he and Mary, I had a solitary tear weld up in my eye. For me, that is the sign of a good movie. Don't over-analyze it. Just go and see it for the fun of it. My demographic: 51, married woman. PS>>>> I'm editing this review to address all the reviews that say there is no story line in this movie. Get out your American History books, kids! The 'story line' was pre written, even before the novel was. No, really, it was! The vampires are just an added bonus. Sheesh!",8,1,2,1 July 2012
A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper is the Star
","Movie is good, slow moving, so much so that my husband was making the snoring sound more than once. Music is good, Gaga's voice is great, as always. But for some reason I found her distracting me throughout the film. Bradley Cooper is Thee Star of this movie. Seriously unrecognizable and magnificent! I rarely if ever thought about it being him playing the role of Jackson Maine. He WAS Jackson Maine with all the pain and suffering that person holds on to. Wow! Truly set a new highbar for himself. He should win an Oscar. He is the reason to go see this movie. Also, fun to see Sam Elliott again.

Gravity," Visually Stunning
","I give it a 9 for the visual beauty of this movie. You haven't seen anything like it. I don't just mean the anti-gravity in space-type stuff floating around. Although all that made us shake our head.... how'd they do that!! *spoilers* Rather, I mean the scene shot from the perspective of being inside the space suit helmet looking out. The scene when she finally gets into the space capsule and floats in the fetal position. Even the very last scene when she's clutching the sand and the shot of her standing from the feet up. All very different and powerful. I am not at all a fan of 3D. I usually get dizzy and motion sick with it. This 3D is very different, on par with Avatar only better. I forgot I had the glasses on until it was over. Not distracting and totally enhancing. There are a couple of parts, one in particular, where there's a flaw in the physics of space and how matter would react in it. But if it wasn't for my husband, I wouldn't of noticed it myself. Short movie at 90 minutes. But long enough. I know I'm possibly the only person in the country who doesn't really like watching Sandra Bullock movies, but she did well in this movie albeit still hanging on to her usual facial expressions and awkward out bursts of emotion. George Clooney is just goofy (as always), but effective",9,3,5,5 October 2013
The Hunger Games," We didn't fall asleep....
","I'm 50, my husband is 58. We never read the book, but have been hearing about this movie for a year from our 18 year old daughter. We went to see it on her recommendation. It's a good movie, and as my husband states, it held his interest, he didn't fall asleep, killed 2 hours and he didn't leave feeling like he was once again ripped off of money spent on a bad movie. The movie The Truman Show kept popping in my head throughout. I'm sure many of the target demographic have never seen that movie. And at the end, with the berries, The Blue Lagoon popped into my head. So not entirely original plot lines. What I couldn't come to terms with is the plot line of killing 23 teens each year as penance for causing an uprising against the government. And why exactly would people want to watch this and allow it? Husband says they explained it at the beginning, but I missed it, I guess. Another point I didn't fully grasp was the caricature, cross between Cirque costuming and the DR Seuss-esque dress and make-up of the people living in the capital. Weird. But again, I didn't read the book. The actors did do a great job and many of the scenes really added to the movie, notably the scene after Katniss was stung by the wasps, and the way Rue's death was handled. Woody Harrelson was great as he usually is. Lenny Kravitz was a nice surprise and also did quite nicely. I just can't get past the fact that these teens were made to kill each other for sport.",8,4,11,25 March 2012
The Lost City of Z," Save for PPV
","SPOILERS Very, VERY slow movie. What I loved were the period costumes, I LOVED the wife, good actress, and he should've brought her along when she asked, The sense of adventure and awe as the group set out the first time, And the second time, the Beautiful scenery all around, The portrayal of the savages and their village, just perfect & fascinating in every detail. What I DIDN'T like and found extremely distracting and just plain wrong was the time line of the movie. I found my self thinking about the kids way too much and how old they were and how old I thought they should be considering the previous dialog or scenes. Although the director did give us time stamps throughout the film, I couldn't reconcile them with the children's ages and the age progression of Percy Fawcett. Also, I was personally let down by the fact that we never do see the lost city. It is post scripted that now in modern day there has been evidence found showing indications of a lost city in both the location and in detail of what Fawcett was searching for. But what about the compass?? DID he and his son make it to the city of zed and then held captive so no other White Man would ever know, OR did they chose to stay until their end of days?? OR were they boiled and eaten?? Life is mysterious.....Married female 55",6,1,4,23 April 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," I was blown away
","This is a great movie, in spite of what the professional critics say. I either had the goose bumps or tears in my eyes throughout most of the film. Movie portrays the exciting and extremely SAD life of Freddie Mercury. He was a genius who birthed the vision for QUEEN. Those reviewers who state the movie is Fake because it doesn't represent his true life.... Look, we all know his life and how he lived it. They respectfully show enough tidbits of his inner demons and pain to make one remember-AH, yes, he was out of control, but kept the emphasis on the music, the band, the relationships, the feeling. You don't need to see more, you get it.
The LiveAid ending of this film will be remembered as one of the greatest movie endings of all time. No kidding, we were clapping, arms in the air, gasping in disbelief, crying. It was truly a moment.
Of course it MAY help if you were of age back then in '85 and actually saw it happen. But even if not, by this point in the film, if you have a soul or a penchant for nostalgia, you will gain much from this ending and leave with nothing but a feeling of melancholy & Love in your heart.
Long Live QUEEN!",9,5,6,6 November 2018
Man of Steel," Superman?
","Way, WAY too much CGI.Too fast, too choppy. Too much destruction. Hard to follow. The final battle scene is way too long and CGI that keeps changing in size proportion is extremely distracting and quite frankly, amaturistic (don't think that's a word). And not necessary. Not sure what or whom Zack Snyder was going for. Movie is much more action-adventure than super hero. I found it extremely weird the casting of Diane Lane & Kevin Costner (really?) as Clark's earthly parents. I mean, what was the last movie these two were in and how long ago? Hello...it's the summer of 2013! Russell Crowe did very well as Jor-El. He's always a pleasure. I did enjoy Superman. Henry Cavill did a very nice job, wore the suit well. I also enjoyed seeing all the 'hidden' references to both the last incarnation of the Superman franchise and the TV show Smallville, which I loved. I had higher hopes, but movie fell flat. Audience connection and emotion doesn't come thru with all the special effects commotion happening. I did shed a tear during the tornado scene, even though I can't understand why he didn't just run out and save his dad? I still contend StarTrek is the best movie of the summer. Iron Man 3, a distant second.",Null,1,3,16 June 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Great movie
","This is a great movie. Although my husband's take away was that it is a chick flick, it is really a movie about mental illness. Yes, the ending is chick flicky and contrived but Bradley Cooper plays an awesome Pat Solitano, a man in his own head with his own demons to work through. I guess I identified with this movie because I have a 'Pat Solitano' in my family and he's married to my sister. Not that she's cheating, but the irrational rages, yelling, repeatedly saying 'Can i tell you something?', the OCD, the craziness when his mind gets set on a task (like finding a wedding video) . He won't take any meds either. As portrayed in the movie, it stems from the family. Examine the Robert DiNero character and his marriage relationship with his wife, mostly the way the wife manages the marriage to keep her husband and his own illness at bay. She's on edge, always smiling, everything is OK, when it's anything but. Bradley Cooper played this part spot on and I'm sure he did much research before filming. It is very difficult to play someone with a non-recognized mental illness effectively and convincingly and so emotionally grabbing without over acting it. He deserves recognition for this roll. I appreciated the way the Tiffany character, played beautifully by Jennifer Lawrence, kept him grounded by bringing his illness right smack into his face, all while going through her own grief and time of uncertain despair. If the ending was handled differently I would've given this movie a 10. But really an important film to see and maybe even take 'that' family member or friend with you so a conversation can be started.",9,2,5,9 January 2013
Paranormal Activity," Not worth the time
","Let me start with my personal demographic which I wish others would do when writing a review. Female, 48, Tucson AZ. I will also say that I was very close to walking out of 'What Lies Beneath' so many years ago because of the fear factor. I'm an easy scare, eyes covered, head buried in neighbors' shoulder if ever there is the slightest hint of approaching horror tension. I sat thru this movie arms folded in front of me, chuckled a few times, never once jumped or gasped. The first hour is extremely slow and boring. The guy character is dumb as a rock. The girl plays her roll better, but as someone else said above, couldn't they call in a priest, rabbi, maybe Another demonologist in southern California?! The progression of anticipated fear and terror is not as described in previous reviews. It's just not done well. It's just silly. And my boyfriend, 56, totally called the whole ending to me 15 minutes before it happened. It could be that 20-30somethings see this movie with different eyes, which is why I would like ages included with reviews. But if you're in my age range, Zombieland is a way far better bang for the buck, and lots of fun too.",3,10,19,25 October 2009
Titanic," 'See it again for the first time'
","I love the way people write 'May Contain Spoilers'. Are there folks out there who have never seen the movie in theater, on TV, on DVD or VHS ? Are there folks that don't know the story? Makes me chuckle. But I digress.... This movie is one of the best ever made and I was thrilled to see it again on the big screen. I do not believe the 3D adds anything to the film, as much of it is still in 2D with the 3D element in either the foreground or back round. I am not that observant to notice that the brightness of the film is 20% diminished due to wearing the glasses, as others have mentioned. I am spell bound by the story telling.... documentary/love story/action disaster movie. I have see this movie more times than I can count , including no fewer than 8 times in the theater when it first came out. I still cry every time, starting when Jack takes rose flying off the bow of the ship, heightening when the string quartet starts playing 'Nearer,My God, to Thee' and I don't stop until after the credits roll. Every element of this film holds your interest, characters are spot on, once the sink sequence starts it is edge of your seat, heart pounding as you see special effects that you can't believe before your eyes. And for me personally, shout out to the costume/wardrobe outfitters because I love the clothes in this movie. Cameron's attention to detail is unmatched. Bravo to his work ethic! I guess that's why it takes him 10 years to make his blockbusters. But, hey, when the films make over $100mil, you don't really need more than 2!",10,4,10,7 April 2012
American Made," Tom Cruise redeemed
","Between the time of Jerry McGuire & now, the only two Tom Cruise movies I've watched was War of the Worlds & Valkyrie, both of which I liked. But I am not a fan and avoid his movies. We went to see American Made because lately we're all swept up into NARCOS and the like. The subject matter interested us so we went. It was very good, better than expected. Tom Cruise in his best role AND his best acting. Maybe because he's older and wiser now, same age as me. Maybe he's had a good acting coach as of late. He's had much work done to his appearance, maybe this also lends to his 'rebirth'. He doesn't look like you remember him, this is a good thing. The film moved at a good pace, I was kept interested and involved throughout. I thought the relationship between Barry Seal and his wife Lucy was never fully developed. She's was just kind of there, keeping quiet & dragged through, never seen asking many questions but was seen dripping in jewelry and furs which we never saw being purchased or given to her. Just a disconnect in that relationship, probably because of time constraints. I think Caleb Landry Jones as JB, Lucy's broken brother, did a FABULOUS job. Wow, good acting there. We've watched much about the 1970's & 80's drug trade and the cartels, movies and documentaries. This was a different story I hadn't heard. I didn't know they dropped drugs into the swamp bayou in Louisiana! And much like Walter White & Pablo Escobar, one wonders how much is enough money before you can just stop- Just Say NO- and enjoy life. There is never enough . Give this one a chance.",9,1,5,1 October 2017
Jersey Boys," Clint Eastwood scores again
","My husband and I just returned from seeing Jersey Boys. We loved it. I may be biased because I am Italian from New York and I laughed out loud at many of the unique-to-Italians dialog and inferences. Truth be told, this is the sad story of the Life and Times of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. His sound,the music are great and legendary, but unlike the musical, I believe this movie emphasizes the sad state of his life during his rise, fall and rise again. With his shyster 'friend' Tommy De Vito tangling with the profits unchecked by anyone, and all his personal life drama and heartache, I found myself feeling sad and wondering how this could've happened. Would it ever happen today? Cast did great and always a treat to see Walken. Cameo by Billy Gardell was a surprise. Grab a tissue for Can't keep my eyes off of you, one of the only songs performed in its entirety in the film. With the horns! Even my husband got the chills! When it was over, the theater clapped! In the end, look... we are still enjoying his music and sound, going to the musical and the movie some 60 years later. And my husband just read that he's worth $60M today, so I don't feel so bad any more!",8,20,26,21 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Disturbing, but I liked it
","Great things: Leonardo DiCaprio is truly great in this role. He is a fantastic actor and his performance is Oscar worthy. My mind never drifted away from him BEING Jordan Belfort. This movie kept me totally engaged. Didn't feel like 3 hours. I never found myself bored or losing interest or looking at the time. Good things: Jonah Hill. I usually do not enjoy watching him in anything (except MoneyBall) He did good in this movie as a goofy, inept & conflicted stockbroker Donnie Azoff. I found myself enjoying his uncomfortable performance. Not so good things: Wow, this movie disturbed me. Excessive drug use. Hard to believe he didn't kill himself from an overdose. Or that he was able to function at all at such a high capacity while being so wasted ALL the time. Excessive sex and nudity. We get it. Belfort was a drug, sex and money addict. This was the late eighties/early nineties. One wonders if he hadn't contracted or spread HIV/AIDS or some other horrible STD without even knowing or caring if he did. To me in my world, the orgies and sex scenes, even with his wife, were very nasty and disturbing. I often wonder why the Long Island, NY accent is alway so hyper-exaggerated by actors who are putting it on for their role. But this is my pet peeve as a born and raised Long Island girl, although now living in the Southwest. I also really enjoyed learning about the world of stocks and stock brokering. Lead to good conversation with my husband who does dabble in stocks from time to time. I do recommend this movie. However if you have extreme sensitivity to foul, awful language, sex and drugs I would skip it. I'm F, 52yo",Null,10,21,25 December 2013
Arrival," Could've been great, but....
","There really are spoilers in this, so read after you watch and see if you agree.... Starts out so promising with the 12 pods floating just off the ground all around the planet. They kinda rushed through so many details leaving one to assume much. On the other hand, movie was dead slow in places taking way to long to make a point. I did find her interactions with the creatures eerie and intense, especially at the beginning, before the nonsense began. Trying to figure out their language and communicate with them was intriguing. There is the back story of her daughter from birth until her untimely death (or did she?), which leads to some kind of idea-- mentioned in only one sentence, might I add- about 'Time being not linear', flash backs, or maybe flash-forwards -to incidences involving the Chinese general, Kids drawings, clay figures and Jeremy Renner was always there as the father of her kid???? What?? I was lost! And then POOF, the pods dematerialize and disappear. The point was totally lost on me. I found the sub-title words of what the aliens were saying to her hokey and out of place. After the first hour it's like the director said 'OK Lets wrap this up quick, we're out of time to schedule in any sense of it all. Which was a real shame. For clarity, we are huge Alien/Sci-fi/UFO fans and rarely miss a show or movie in this genre.",5,2,8,11 November 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Thinking, feeling movie. It's great!
","People who review this movie poorly simply do not understand this film. I'm not high and mighty, But this is an intelligent, thinking movie and those that didn't like it were quite possibly expecting a Birdman come back action hero movie. This is a movie about Riggan Thomas, an actor who used to play the beloved action super hero Birdman on the big screen. Alas, some 20 years ago he thumbed down a Birdman IV movie sequel and has since been fondly remembered and recognized by fans, but otherwise forgotten about by most everyone else.. Although his role as Birdman is long over, The Birdman has never left him, as his alter-ego is still the voice in his head, for better or for worse. This movie is purely about his life journey to regain the notoriety and status he held all those years ago or to move on from it completely by leaving his mark as the writer, director and star of a hit play on Broadway. The movie portrays the backstage makings of a B'way show to be gritty and dysfunctional with the elements of sex, drugs, alcohol and slander in abundance and personal life struggles of all involved examined. To those who say it's overacted, I disagree. But acting emphasis may have been placed on purpose to put a period on the point of all that was going on around him while dealing with his own demons on the path to his redemption. What was so interesting to me is the movie feels like a play as it unfolds with the amazing filming technique of the continuous shot. This means the camera follows the action continuously, without a break in scene or motion. Several times the shot ends with a long frame of a night time scene only to have the sun rise, building lights turned off all in the same frame, then a continuing pan through the window right into the next scene, following the actors and action unbroken. It's very cool and very effective because you're right there. There's nothing to miss. Michael Keaton is truly genius. His finest moment on the screen. Edward Norton..wow. Better than The Fight Club, if that's possible. And Emma Stone, you will see her in a new light, as a real acting presence. I was shocked! This is a feeling movie. You will feel, especially towards the end. While very funny at times with bright spots of hope, the over all feeling is sad. But the ending is mystical so you can give it a happy ending if you choose. Demographic: Me and Husband, 53 & 62. Avid movie goers.",9,3,9,21 December 2014
Life," I was scared
","55 year old female here (I wish folks would write their age and sex when then review) For at least half the film I was fully engaged in this alien horror film. I was scared, more than once, turning away or covering my eyes. There are intense, scary moments. For a while, it absolutely reminded me of a remake of Alien. But distracting ridiculousness kicked in. I found myself turning to my husband saying Wait, what was that? How is this happening? Where did that come from? I thought it needed oxygen to live...... etc. We walked away saying it was a good movie, but predictable and turned silly towards the end. Not as smart & intelligent as Alien, but not a waste of time. The end is supposed to be a twist, but is almost expected and opens the door for a sequel, which I'm sure they'll do. It won't be any good.",7,27,42,1 April 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fun, funny & over the top on purpose
","I can't help but wonder if all the folks reviewing this movie saw the same film! The movie is based on a comic book, folks! This is a satire-spoof type movie of the 1970's spy movie/show genre. Think early Bond or the Man from U.N.C.L.E., but WAY over exaggerated, over acted, overly violent (but in a funny way), overly ridiculous & overly implausible (ah, but is it?) BUT utterly great in its delivery. We and the audience around us laughed out loud throughout. Entertaining & engaging characters. Samuel Jacksons lisp which many called distracting was part of the over acting. It's meant to be distracting. I know the church scene is what blows the violence level through the roof. But following the movie premise, it's kill or be killed. People complain about too much F bomb. We do not remember an overuse of the word. We walked out of the Wolf of Wall Street disgusted & complaining about the 500+ F-bomb drops. We can't recall an instance of it being said in this movie. The movie will bring up discussions on micro chipping, cell phone technology and technology in general, and global warming, or lack there of, to a lesser degree. Yes, that is Mark Hamill playing Professor Arnold. Don't miss that fact until you see his name in the credits, like I did. Don't take the kids. Just go see it for what it is, funny & enjoyable. And don't miss the 3 second long scene where you see Valentine with Obama in the window of the White House listening to him (Obama) speak. Sounds just like him too. Could it be...",8,3,11,14 February 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," Spend your money elsewhere
","My husband turned to me as the end credits started rolling and said 'That was the worst movie I ever saw.' And I agree with him. It starts off OK as any cabin in the woods movie would. But it goes somewhere incomprehensible shortly thereafter. Whatever unfolds is without explanation. And if it's supposed to be a spoof of all previous horror films ever made (as some have said in other reviews) it is still a miss. Spoiler Alert: it's not scary at all! There is slasher blood, lot's of it. And zombies (I am so over zombies). I either missed or didn't understand what the big twist is many talk about. You know from the first scene of the movie there are people in charge of overseeing the cabin and all that goes on there. There was no twist. Period. It's just a stupid movie with no plot and no horror. And I'm sorry, but if you either love, like, or recommend this movie you are smoking way too much of that stuff Marty smokes. Do not go to see this movie if you are over 20. I give it a 3 because I did LOL a few times, so I guess I was mildly entertained once or twice. PS... The cameo appearance at the end is NOT by 'a horror movie icon' as several have stated. Those are 2 completely different genres of movies.",3,124,247,14 April 2012
The Martian," Mostly believable & very good Mars movie
","If for no other reason, see it for the Real 3D effect. It's not the old fashioned, dizzying constant stuff flying into your face. and usually done very poorly at that. It's immersive 3D. The picture has a foreground, middle and back round all in focus and interactive at the same time. It is not distracting at all. I forgot about the glasses being on my face and i didn't get nauseous! It's gives a new meaning to what we know as 3D. Truly the best I've ever experienced. This movie is 100X Better that Gravity, which was terrible on so many levels. This one was very interesting and used better science. Matt Damon did very well as he always does.",8,1,37,4 October 2015
