Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Entertaining despite many many flaws
","*** THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS***OK first things first : without any reasonal doubt the Phantom Menace doesn 't even hold a candle to the original trilogy . Lucas and co have decided to make the prequels simply to cash in the phenomenal success of Star Wars . Episode I is a very different story from its predecessors but it doesn 't mean it is a bad movie . I am a hardcore fan of Star Wars but before I watched it I had lowered my expectations enough to wait a mindless action film . I can understand why all the fans were disappointed since there were so many things wrong with this movie .1) Unbelievably lame CG special effects . The robot soldiers were so fake that make one wonder when the Hollywood producers finally LEARN THEIR LESSON THAT MODERN DOESN 'T NECESSARILY MEAN BETTER AND CG DESIGNS ARE FOR THE MOST PART UNCONVINCING ??? Just look at how convincing the old fashioned antiquated SFX of the original trilogy with the imaginative costumes and suits are . What we have in the Phantom Menace is a terrible bunch of alien creatures annoying to the bone . The SFX crew are not the only ones to blame since the film had such a high budget that could include more talented designers . Just look at the canteen scene at the airport of Tattoine in Star Wars (1977) and the PM pales in comparison . From the Siamese two headed speaker of the pod race to the flying grumpy ugly master of Annakin and his mother , these creatures have none of the imaginative creation and charisma of the original 's . Jabba , in one of the few reoccuring roles , is one of the few exceptions and I would like to say that the only one I liked is (surprise , surprise ) Jar Jar Binks !!!!!! To all those thousands of Jar Jar haters out there I would like to say I found him entertaining and at the worst case passable and that HE IS NOT THE FILM ' S  LOW POINT .  Stop bashing him for God 's shake . He is not the disgrace to Episode I .The director should focus less on those ugly and repelling creatures since they were unsuccessful . If he wanted to provide us eye candy or at least introduce us to his strange universe he should put his money on the scenery. This was also a lost bet which leads us to ....2) Mediocre art direction . None of the scenes can top the brilliance of the compelling Death Star with its white lighted sterilized corridors in Star Wars , the frozen landscape of Hoth or the pink clouded sky city in Empire Strikes Back or even the forests on the Ewoks planet in Return of Jedi . I would like to admit however that the production designs were at least decent like Princess Amidala 's palace . The best though is undoubtly the sand-grounded planet Annakin lives which manages to bring us some of the much needed nostalgia of Tattoine .3) The story is confusing : I never understood why all this mumble with the federation , the senate etc . Oh well who cares ? Not only the plot is insignificant but the main point is the research for the man who will bring the 'Balance of the Force'  (the movie's original subtitle) . The greatest weakness of the script was of course ****spoiler****** having a 10 year old boy navigating with incredible agility a flying combat spacecraft and infiltrating the enemy 's spaceship so easily ..... Whatever.....**********4) Ewan Mc Gregor is wasted here . He practically is non - existing !! Little screen time and very few lines : he spends most of the movie nodding his head when his master tells him something in order to show he agrees with him !!! I guess this was intentional in order to wait for him to be developed in the next film .5) Terrible and unnecessary make up for Natalie Portman . uuuugghhh .. disgusting !!! Can I presume it was also intentional to cover her up for safety reasons ?And now the positive points1) Much welcomed cameos from C3PO and R2D2 . More screen time for themwould also be plausible2) The Ben Hur-esque pod race is enough to keep you at the edge of your seat.3) Liam Neeson is EXCEPTIONAL as the (essentially) leading character and the best part is that he doesn 't even try !! Whoever cast him as the master Jedi made a wise choice . Neeson has such a calm yet powerful appearance , such a philosophic image and exhales so much confidence and reliability that he is perfect . He is the ideal portrayal of a Jedi knight . ******spoiler*****too bad he won 't be in the sequels******4) I know I am once again the minority but actually Jake Lloyd is quite good. All this whining 'he is a stupid kid with all his yuppies!! ' is really inane . FOR CHRIST 'S SAKE  what did you want ? A junior Darth Vader with a helmet and black suit ??? The script follows Annakin as a young charismatic slave who deals with his special uniqueness . He is confused because he has the choice of leaving with God-looking (in his childish eyes) Jedis to be trained but has to leave his mother behind . Lloyd gives a very nice performance (especially compared to other kid actors) . And just look at how ironic and creepy is the scene where Annakin meets Obi-One.5) The final edition with the climax in three different points of battle is done nicely and is the best sequence of the entire film .The highlight of course was the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul and the Jedis which also is one of the few connecting links with the initial trilogy. ( however , am I the only one who noticed that an unfair battle 2 vs one is extremely incompatible with the Jedi - code - of - honor ? )Enough said I think . Episode I is a timid beginning and a setup for the next movies with the discovery of Annakin Skywalker and a few occasional gratuitous action scenes like the underwater chase sequence with the cetacean creature . Not a great movie but mindless fun .

As Good as It Gets," Overrated
","What 's all the fuss about ? This is one of the most mediocre films I have ever seen . See it for yourself and judge . The characters wereextremely underdevelopped . The script had many flaws . Instead of having a solid story and characterisation , the movie relies on SkeetUlrich 's naked ass and some wannabe dramatic quarrels between Nicholson and Hunt which fail miserably , like in the restaurant . Anyway Jack Nicholson gives a solid and satisfying performance and that is a major pro . He is not over the top but he plays his anti social character tactfully . Unfortunately Helen Hunt is AWFUL !!!!!!! Yes you read right awful , terrible and irritating . I can 't believe how bad performance this was and I really don 't think this is the writer 's fault . She competes Holly Hunter in 'Copycat' for  the worst performance in film history . Cuba Guding Jr has a brief cameo and somehow steals the show with his dynamic personna . If there is a reason to watch this film it is indisputably Greg Kihnear . He manages to create soul and emotion for his character and he is the only lead whom you care about . You are heartbroken when he is beaten savagely and you care for his fate . Apart from Kihnear the film hasn 't much to offer . I am shocked with these positive commentsand with the 7.7 average rating !!! If you want a good social characters comedy , watch the REAL BLONDE with Mathew Mondine .                This film gets a healthy                                                             6 / 10",6,0,1,24 July 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Very good 4th part in the alien series-every sci-fi fan should see it !!!
","****The first two paragraphs are an extended plot description . If you have already seen the movie you may as well skip them******** For those who haven't seen the movie there may be some SLIGHT SPOILERS****
It has finally happened . After 200 years the unstoppable hostile beasts called aliens are resurrected . Lieutenant Ripley Ellen is long dead but the scientists found the secret to bring her back along with the alien queen embryo that she carried inside her . The greedy corporation Ripley worked for doesn't exist , but as long there is money and power hungry governments , somewhere , somehow , there will be someone who will fund an illegal program of bio-engineering in order to find the secret of the alien power . In this case the United Military Organization is behind this project although it is obvious that they are not even authorized by the Congress . They want to breed a new alien species to study them for purposes such as vaccines or alloys (but who are they kidding ? Inevitably the aliens will be exploited as a new super weapon) . The space base Auriga where the experiment is being conducted , is in orbit behind Pluto (naturally every illegal program takes place beyond the borders of the solar system) . The leader of Auriga is General Perez (Dan Hedaya) a rather mild mannered military officer who wants the project not to take a single risk . The scientists are led by Dr Wren (J.E. Freeman) and Dr Gediman (Brad Dourif) who are very enthusiastic about the potential of their task . They use frozen samples of Ripley 's blood in order to get the mixed human/alien D.N.A. and eventually clone Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) , resurrecting her and the alien fetus . The clone has not only the looks and physical shape of the deceased Ripley but unpredictably it has inherited all her memories and her psychological characteristics . There are also other side effects due to the genetic crossover and the clone shows some special features . The scientists isolate Ripley to study her later and focus on the Alien Queen which grows rapidly and incubates . In order to find some hosts for the face-huggers and the alien larvae , General Perez allies with a team of space smugglers led by Captain Elgyn (Michael Wincott) . They are black market merchandisers and in this case they supply Auriga with people they hijacked from other spaceships while they were on suspended animation . The unfortunate victims against their will are destined to be the first alien fodder . If you think the colonels are scumbags wait to hear where they get their financial sources : they cultivate vast quantities of cannabis ! This was an abandoned scene from the initial script and I thought it was best for you to know . Anyway , within a few days a bunch of aliens blossoms and everyone seems to be happy , but not for long .Captain Elgyn lands on Auriga with his spaceship called `Betty' and they stay for a couple of days for refueling . Elgyn definitely is not aware of the classified project and just wants his fee . The rest of the Betty 's crew are Johner (Ron Perlman) a tough , foul mouthed and ugly sexist goon , Vriess (Dominique Pinon) a handicapped short man who is stuck in a wheel chair and is a mechanic with quite `long hands' , Hillard (Kim Flowers) an attractive woman who is Elgyn 's girlfriend and Christie (Gary Dourdan) a skilled and methodical shooter with rasta hair who is calm and seems to be the second in command . The recently added member is a short young girl named Call (Winona Ryder) who is a talented engineer and is the misfit of the group . Call has read the banned books written centuries ago by the convict Morse (another abandoned line) and is the only one who knows the legends about Ellen Ripley and the aliens . Ripley on the other hand is kind of a savage and autistic child in an uncomfortable environment . She hates the scientists for bringing her back to revive her worst nightmare . The inevitable occurs very soon as the aliens break loose and all hell with them too . The gory killings of the Auriga staff set everyone on alert . General Perez and the vessel 's central computer Father (he he) command the immediate evacuation of Auriga . Very soon all the remaining military members have left via the emergency exit vehicles , while the aliens have already formed a cocooned nest for their queen so she may reproduce more eggs . The space smugglers finally listen to Call 's warnings and head to the Betty . Unfortunately their spaceship is on the other side of Auriga . They form an uneasy alliance with Dr Wren and a soldier called Distephano (Raymond Cruz) who know the ship's design in order to get to the Betty fast and safely . They also take the cloned Ripley with them since her advanced knowledge on the species may be useful . The space shuttle is wrecked and under inner siege . Will their weapons help them survive ? See the movie and judge for yourselves .Jean-Pierre Jeunet gives great imagery to the 4th and last chapter of this immortal sci-fi / horror series . Art direction and the magnificent photography deliver one of the most imaginative science fiction films of the decade despite the overused concept . The plot is rather predictable as we all have seen everything recycled in previous films (like the ending) . The visionary director provides us a beautiful film and the script gives us one of the most successful aspects of cloning in cinema generally . Jeunet and Joss Whedon who wrote the script gave their own approach on the series . The movie relies heavily on blood , gore and violence although it is sometimes depicted in a twisted , black humored , cartoonish manner . This the `funniest' in a dark way chapter of the saga and there are a few moments which tend to self-parody . It doesn't matter at all . The message of the script is the obvious catastrophic impact of the cloning experiments that are bound to happen in the next years . The aliens are now visible more than ever in the screen and they spend a lot of time gutting soldiers in the most vicious way (splatter fans will find their favorite element and glee) . We have seen the stereotypes `Man cannot tame nature' and `Greed is always punished' in numerous films but Alien Resurrection pulls it off with utter success . The sanguinary beasts dispatch the naive humans who foolishly thought they could control them , in the most revengeful way . Yes there are numerous films which have dealt with cloning but never this successfully . From the 7 mistakes preceding Ripley to the final `rebirth' the side effects are clear as crystal : messing with the genes can only generate trouble and atrocious monstrosities . The former scene is the most tragic one of the movie and will truly be the one Alien Resurrection will be remembered for . It sums up the poetic vision that Jeunet tried to give us and it is a chilling dramatic scene about what we might all experience in the (not so) distant future . Weaver 's character includes some surprises and twists and this really helps because a series needs evolution in order to survive . This is the most intriguing aspect of the Alien quartet . Each part was directed , written , photographed etc. by different people and each one gave his addition in the mythology like for example the biology of the creatures.
Alien Resurrection suffers from a great deal of problems which made the fans turn their back and despise it . Many of them thought that the film was way over the top and not terrorizing enough and lambasted Jeunet as improper for the job . As I already mentioned Alien Resurrection combines perfectly the dark shadows of a possible future with spoofing sequences and at the same moment grotesque images : the evacuation scene seems to be inspired by the respective one in Spaceballs ! Indeed some of the one - liners suck BADLY and almost turn the film to a typical Hollywood urban chauvinistic action flick  `Who do I have to f*** to get off this spaceship ?' . Others are smashing and pull your leg nicely `Hey , Ripley , I heard you like , run into these things before' `Yeah !' `Wow man : so , what did you do ? `  ` I died !!' . The profanity here has hit the ceiling but I think that there is some background to it and let us not forget that the leads are criminals or rough military members . The greatest problem is the newly introduced characters . Ripley 's transformation and the ethical dilemmas she faces are nicely executed . Weaver gives a standout performance and she may be a bit more cynical but after the odyssey she has endured it is quite logical . After all , her new capabilities and enhanced power breath a touch of fresh air . It would be dull and repetitive if she was the same character . Winona Ryder is also very good as the mysterious Call . The two of them share good chemistry and accomplish the best acting of the film. J.E. Freeman is solid as Dr Wren too . Unfortunately the rest of the leads stink badly . I don 't care if it was intentional but Ron Perlman's character is thoroughly dislikeable and unbearable . Dominique Pinon is not especially amiable either . It also puzzles me why did they bother casting Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif in virtually non existing roles . Just for the billing I guess . Both of them are literally wasted here and I am talking about less-than-cameo status . I have never heard of Michael Wincott and can 't see why he is so popular . His coarse voice makes him another repulsive character (probably he is the most chain-smoking person on earth) and he is also wasted . Characters worth caring for are Christie and Hillard . Kim Flowers is the only one who managed to insert humanity into her character , save Ms Ryder . Gary Dourdan has an underwritten role and too bad because he could have done much much more .  Raymond Cruz is the extra / lead (thought it could never happen in a movie ?) playing the soldier who serves as the guider of the gang and I won 't omit Leland Orser as Purvis , one of the abducted by the smugglers hostages for the aliens harvesting . All the aforementioned characters had great potential but their screen time is little and are never fully developed .Too bad that the main characters are a**holes like Johner or Vriess whom you don 't give a damn for . The worst aspect of the movie is the ending . The baby alien is stupid but what comes as a great disappointment is his showdown with Ripley . OK the scene can be interpreted as hilarious or tragic at the same time but what happens is totally unrealistic (I am talking about laws of physics). The finale is totally rushed and feels a bad cop out . Rumors claim that it was reshot at the last minute (originally the movie ended on Earth) and it shows. Apparently they didn 't have the time to support it with some decent SFX . Another little nitpicking I would like to add is that the music score could have been better and at many parts it feels out of place .
Nevertheless I enjoy the film for many other reasons . The opening line is brilliant and it is quite obvious who Ripley refers to . Secondly , aside from Jeunet's inventive direction and the horrifying messages about cloning , the script finally answers a much debated subject . It is clear now that the aliens ARE intelligent creatures who know where to strike and can even outsmart humans . Another aborted line from the script stated that the aliens communicate with supersounds `just like bats' . The evacuation scene is also the most realistic one I have ever seen in a science fiction film , instead of waiting for the cast to be decimated and finally the 2 - 3 surviving leads go to the EEV , something they could have done right away . Here , when Father sets the distress mode , the soldiers INSTANTLY and without the slightest time waste abandon the vessel . The movie is actually plotless : the first hour is the introducing of the characters (although it is bare) and after the release of the aliens and the mass departure , the second hour is quite simply  and frankly , the course of the leads to the Betty . No intermediate battle scenes just for dwindling of the cast . The SFX are for the most part believable , like the acidic blood , the alien agile moves or the super weapons that the smugglers have . Ripley's bilateral nature makes her and the movie far more interesting than a typical sequel . The acclaimed European director uses astonishing cinematography and brilliant sets to join forces with a genuinely American genre such as science fiction . The combination of Jeunet's psychedelic imagery and ordinary futuristic themes (a la Star Wars , Star Trek etc) is achieved quite balanced and we have an artistic approach to the series.
Alien Resurrection is certainly nowhere near as good as Aliens . It is quite good on its own merit and a decent 4th installment in the Alien universe . It is one of the best samples of sci-fi from the 90's and is bound to earn more recognition in the future . It was actually one of the most anticipated movies in history . Although some were disappointed , it is worth noting that everyone's favorite heroine lived again simply because an Alien film without Sigourney would have been a plain cash-in . The opening scenes with the cloning experiment is what everyone was eager for . This vertical glass tube with the reformed naked Ripley is already a distinct landmark . These sterilized labs with the subtle greenish lighting are uniquely conceived and the depiction is P-E-R-F-E-C-T . The entire film seems a nightmare transferred to the screen . Gross in some points with a wicked sense of irony and some parts that ignore common logic (like the cartoonish ricocheting of the bullets) . This is what Jeunet wanted and the execs did well hiring him . Alien Resurrection stands alone as a lyric vision of the fantastic intergalactic society that cinema tries to predict or warn us . It is not only for strict Alien fans but any casually interested movie fan should check this out . To put it in one word part 4 is one beautiful film . Witness the resurrection !ALIEN RESURRECTION    8 / 10",8,0,1,14 November 2003
12 Monkeys," Intriguing mental game
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Nowadays it is hard to find original and thought-provoking scripts . Therefore I will give my deepest congratulations to the Peoples family for their tight and sophisticated play (I will have to note that I have downloaded the screenplay from the internet and Terry Gilliam has followed the script with religious devoutness , scene by scene and sentence to sentence : he omitted or changed 5 - 6 lines tops ) . I know that the idea was inspired by a French short film but this adaptation is very successful . It was a matter of execution both from the writers and the director . Many viewers have commented on the various issues the film deals with . They have labeled it as 'sci fi' , 'time travel' , 'prophecy about the biological weapons and the nuclear destruction ' etc , etc . I admit that all these subjects are resident in the film but the spinal column is nothing more than a poetic tale of paranoid doubt and vague , blurr memories . It is a search deep down in the abyss of a man 's brain . James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a convict from the future who is sent back in time in 1996 to collect information for a deadly virus which will extinguish 99 % of the human population . He meets a psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe) who wants to help him despite James is a violent and potentially dangerous man (just like a savage beast). He also meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) , a slightly deranged young man whose father is a famous scientist who does research on viruses and is highly likely linked to the total destruction of man kind . This is the basic plot . The scenes in the mental asylum are quite surrealistic and give the stigma of the film . Twelve Monkeys is not your typical sci - fi with laser weapons , aliens , explosions , building collapses etc . Most of the movie is the roaming of James and Kathryn with the car which gives us a sense of a road movie . The fact that you don 't get bored with this non - adrenalin proves the success of the script and the great interest of the characters and the basic premise (despite the orders from the PTBTand the repeated statements from Cole himself , his mission is essentially the salvation of the world although he doesn't admit it ) .
Twelve Monkeys is without doubt a confusing movie with a complex plot . There are questions which are answered by the end and questions that remain unsolved ,like it is never explained what is the husky old voice James hears throughout the film . One of the best lines which summarizes the madness of the whole film is ' Maybe I am in the next cell . Maybe they (the 5 scientists)put me to spy on you . Or MAYBE I am only inside your mind ' . As you realize the awkward and perplexed script is kind of hard to follow . Therefore the ultra-predictable finale (even a 3 year old can figure out the ending 50 minutes into the film) was an obligatory compromise of the writers in order to make the film digestible . James 's dreams are obviously foreseeing and knowing the prophecy you sit back and you are waiting for it to be fulfilled . That is not the end of the suspense though.*********SPOILER ALERT****t 2/3 into the movie a very interesting question rises : is this mission true or James is simply an insane person who lives in a fantastic illusional world ? This I believe is the greatest virtue of Twelve Monkeys and that is why I like it so much . The doubt factor is not inherent from the beginning of the film (like in 'Almost Dead' with Shannen Doherty or 'The Dead Can't Lie' with Tommy Lee Jones') but emerges after the middle and not at all in a gimmicky mode which would have left the viewer feeling cheated . The handling of James' questionable sanity from him and Kathryn and the schizophrenic situation of not knowing what is reality and myth is perfectly executed. I don 't know if it was inspired from Vertigo or other films of the maitre but if it was a rehash it was a good one . Fortunately just before the end the 'historic truth' is restored with tangible evidence that all these really happened ********END SPOILER******** I will urge you to see the film twice . I did it , and it was a wonderful experience . There is too much information for the brain to retain with just one viewing . There are plot elements which play a crucial part for the comprehension of the events and the fight against the tricks of the mind . For example I hadn 't realized the vitally important vocal messages from the future (watch carefully) .I will close the review with comments on the crew members . As you already observed I regard Twelve Monkeys as a script movie and not a director 's . Unfortunately the brilliantly talented Gilliam of 'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' or even the campy 'Time Bandits' backsteps to a coldly professional subtle work . I believe he could have done more . The same goes for the music and the rather lame cinematography . Ok I admit that this nebulous photography works fine in the future scenes or in the foggy streets where the twelve monkeys headquarters are , but other than that it gets annoying . As for the cast Brad Pitt 's overrated performance is enjoyable (but not great) , Bruce Willis does a very good job as the mysterious convict and the most underrated performance is definitely Madeline Stowe 's . She is the only 'logic' axis of the narration . Stowe gives a great appearance throughout the entire spectrum of her character 's aspects . The professional inquisitive psychiatrist , the frightened kidnap victim , the compassionate doctor who wants to help a 'lost soul' who is suffering from hallucinations , the detective / resolver of this frighteningly paranoid situation and finally the protector of the haunted man . Stowe is subtle , grounded and effectively realistic in her performance .All in all , if you want a different kind of entertainment check this out . However if you hate messy mystic films which look like a giant puzzle like 'Dune' then you should clearly stay out . Gilliam 's film is a different original unusual experience .A surrealistic masterpiece         TWELVE MONKEYS    8.5 / 10",9,0,1,20 February 2002
Batman Returns," An artistic masterpiece although misguided (some minor spoilers)
","In order to appreciate this film you must see it 2 or 3 times . I am not kiding . The first time it is going to irritate you and you mayregard it as a travesty . It is very dark and annoyingly grotesque from the middle and further . The beginning is excellent . I can 't say much but it starts like a marvellous German fairy tale set in Christmas . The gothism and the expressionism are dominant through the entire film since the main plot is also in Christmas . Of course the atmosphere is dark like hell and kind of reminds the Gremlins . There are many colourful lights in the entire Gotham city which only emphasise on the nightmarish facts which take place , and on the moody/sad feelings of the heroes . The 4 basic actors are simply great and have a terrific chemistry . Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman gives the darkest performance of the entire series. He is the definition of loneliness . He is way better from the prequel though where he seemed a bit out of place . Danny De Vito is good as the grotesque Penguin , a twisted mutant with naturalistic insticts . The same go for the feline Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) who is the impersonation of self-destructive sadomazochism . Pfeiffer gives her best performance not necessarily when in the black suit , but in portraying the disturbed secretary Selina Kyle behind her . But the  kudos have to go to Christopher Walken because he plays his role with the most amazing way . An evil tycoon who wants to manipulate Gotham and drain the energy for his plant . The sad part is that Max Shreque is the only of these 3 villains who moves rationally with specific motives and reasons . Penguin and Catwoman act inconsistenly and are preposterous .E.g.why Catwoman wants to kill Batman since in the beginning he was the one who saved her life ? She wanted to prove that women can kick a** just like them ? Or her pride simply could not standbeing rescued so she turned against him ? Unfortunately there are many other plot holes like that which make grand cons The music score by Danny Elfman steals the show giving perfectly all the dramatic tension in the souls of the heroes , the nightmarish gothic feeling and a slight reference of Christmas fairy tale for kids !! The same go for the magnificent sets and costumes . Every shot is unique. It looks like a painting picture , progressed meticulously to the last detail . The surrealistic delusional feeling which give you is splendid. The clowns of the Red Triangle Circus gang are pieces of pure art . As for the Penguin 's lair with the vast scenery , what can I say ? NOONE has manged to top this impressive set ever since . So what went wrong ? The answer is the script . There is sick violence in some points and rediculous childness in others . The writers and Burton seemed a bit disorientated and sometimes we have a pure dark mess . This is obvious in the scene where the 2 villains plot to destroy Batman by 'turning him into what he hates most : namely us' or the the one -liners during the fights between Batman and Catwoman . These dialogues are so contrived and silly which make the film worst trash from some saturday morning cartoons !! OH MY GOD WHAT WERE THEY THINKING ???? Not to mention some of the choreographied violence in fight scenes which seem to have popped out of Power Rangers !!!! And exactly why did the Penguin want to kill all the first born boys ? Because of the mommy complex ??? These are questions which will go away ONLY if you have watched it more than once . Anyway Batman Returns is Tim Burton 's best directing job to date . It has symbolisms , psychedelic dreamlike imagery and 4 excellently packed up plots corresponding to the 4 stars . You are NEVER bored since each one of them could carry a movie by his/her own . Be prepared though for a little too much dark . In the worst case you can enjoy it as a very bad written cartoon with much irony and black humour. Nevertheless it is an artistic masterpiece with some classic and very powerful scenes like the the transformation of Selina in Catwoman or the intense finale (30 plus minutes long). Not the best inthe series but the the more surrealistic . Just don 't take it too seriously .BATMAN RETURNS            8.5 / 10",8,0,0,3 June 2001
X-Men," Way too overhyped but OK film
","Directed by  Brian Singer Written by  David Hayter , Tom DeSanto and Bryan SingerStarring  Hugh Jackman , Patrick Stewart , Anna Paquin , Ian McKellen and Famke Janssen
Before I begin I should say that I am quite unrelated with the X-men universe . I have never read comics and the only character I knew apart from the celebrated worldwide Wolverine , was Cyclops . I can understand that the film by Brian Singer followed accurately the story and the origin of the characters so the fans liked the movie . Unfortunately the film hasn't got much to offer to the rest of the sci-fi and comics - transferred - to - celluloid aficionados . The 7.3 (!!!) rating is too much and I don't care about how much some X-men fans will protest , but comparing X-men to classics like Superman or Batman is an insult . I have already written in my Mortal Kombat Annihilation review (read it if you like) that it is strictly for well knowing fans of the video game and the rest are advised to keep away because most probably they will be lost . X-men 's fatal flaw is the same : too many characters in one short movie . But where at least MK:A had wonderful fight scenes and some decent SFX , X-Men fails miserably not only action-wise but the character development is also a letdown . Now , I would like to think that the deleted scenes which are included in the DVD will improve the unfinished elements but only time will tell . For now , the official cut is disappointing . Don't believe the hype : X-Men is an OK film but really nothing special . The critics for once again are proven to be wrong . There is actually nothing that differentiates the film from other ones . The comments about `adult' themes and `futuristic' imagery make me want to laugh . Batman (1989) had much more adult atmosphere and movies like `Dark City' or even `Demolition Man' deal much better with social and political issues than this latest cinematic adaptation of the famous characters . X-Men cannot hide its comics origins and it is not as dark as the official critics alleged . It DEFINITELY doesn't reach an intellectual level .PLOT SYNOPSIS :  The not so distant future . In the USA there is a great number of mutants . Although it is never explained how the mutations occurred , it is probably due to perturbations of D.N.A. The mutants have some amazing super-powers which have caused people to be afraid of them . The mutants cannot live ordinary lives and try to hide their secret because they now that a disclosure will ostracize them from society for good . As if this wasn't enough , a Senator called Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) has started a campaign against mutants and wants to confine them so their super-powers will not be a threaten to society . Unbeknownst to his plans , there is a powerful mutant who is also a wise scientist , Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) with enhanced telekinetic and telepathic abilities (ironically he is stuck in a wheelchair) . Professor Xavier (a.k.a. Professor X) has founded an occluded academy for mutant children . He teaches them how to use the powers they have and learn how to control them . He is an idealist and believes that some day the mutants will be incorporated as a healthy tissue of the society along `normal' humans . There is also another equally powerful mutant scientist Eric Lensherr (a.k.a. Magneto) with the ability to manipulate metal objects within a remarkable range and scale with exceptional timing and synchrony . Magneto (Ian McKellen) believes that a war is coming and he wants to exterminate humans before they get the chance to strike first . Professor X and Magneto were old friends  but now their philosophies are bound to clash . Professor X's key assistants in the academy are Scott Summers (James Marsden) alias Cyclops whose eyes emit deadly energy blasts , Orore Munroe (Halle Berry) alias Storm with the ability to control thunders and air and Dr Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) a skilled scientist with limited telekinetic and telepathetic powers . The basic star of the film is actually Wolverine (a brilliant Hugh Jackman) a mysterious man with amnesia who has the power to heal himself rapidly from serious injuries. He meets with a mutant girl called Mari D' Ancanto (Anna Paquin) alias Rogue who has an energy-draining ability and her touch can be deadly . When the two of them are attacked by Magneto 's henchmen they are rescued by Cyclops and Storm and are taken in the Academy for security . Rogue is adjusted easily and makes new friends but Wolverine doesn't want to stay despite Professor X's warnings that Magneto is after him . Predictably more fights among the X-Men and Magneto 's gang will ensue .This is the so-called `plot' of the movie . The first half hour before we enter the Academy is extremely weak and boring . If you are not familiar with X-Men you will not understand much . Towards the end there is a `master plan' by Magneto but it is a desperate and futile attempt to create a plot where there isn't there any . So what happens in between ? First of all Magneto is not evil and his henchmen are ugly and repelling freaks with lousy make-up . Mystique 's blue body is cheaply made and disgusting . The villains are not interesting . On the X-Men side things are not better . Storm (a woefully underdeveloped Halle Berry) and Cyclops hardly ever use their powers . Even worse they are decorative . The entire movie looks cheap. I don 't care how much money it cost but it looks cheap . Most of the SFX are nothing special and I was expecting better from a 2000 new-tech film . I have seen better SFX from older movies (Superman) or TV shows . Mystique 's shape-shifting , Cyclops 's red rays or even Magneto 's white light-emitting device are cheap and could be included in a 1970 's B-movie . What I liked was Storm 's abilities to fly and control the weather but as I already said she hardly uses them . Most of the fight scenes are also disappointing . As for character development forget it . Patrick Stewart was an ideal choice for the role but even he is not given much to do except from reciting his history to Wolverine . The interesting characters are Dr Jean Grey and Rogue. Famke Janssen and Anna Paquin try valiantly but suffer from a shallow script . There are also cameos from Pyro (a young man with pyrokinetic abilities) , the well known Iceman and Kitty Pride ,  a girl who can pass through walls with momentary dematerialization , who are all students at the Academy . I guess we will have to wait for the next film to see their characters stretched out . Professor X , Storm , Cyclops , Dr Jean Grey and Rogue have great potential and worth more screen time . This is another great problem of the film apart from the cheap SFX : the leads are never given origin or motives . They simply are there and act mechanistically . X-Men is clearly an introductory film and it leaves you wanting for more . As for the messages about racism and the obvious parallelism to Mac Carthy's politics ? Cute and welcomed but haven't we really seen it all over again in other films ? So this is not an innovation .There is one thing I liked and of course this is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine . The man was born for to play this role . Wolverine is the lead of the movie . His claws is the most convincing SFX and he is the most developed character . In the future we will probably dig up more information about his past and how he obtained his powers . Hugh Jackman gives a great performance and survives the script 's flaws . On the acting side Famke Janssen , Anna Paquin and the ever reliable Patrick Stewart give solid appearances despite the one-dimensional roles . Has this film any other virtues ? Quite a few I am afraid . The academy 's scenery is quite psychedelic and who can forget the scene with Wolverine walking through the corridor with the mirrors . Some of the costumes are also nice . Jackman and Paquin share an interesting quasi-erotic chemistry . I also liked Bruce Davison as the Congressman and I believe he should be used more . And no matter how cheaply directed and unoriginal , the final showdown between X-Men and Magneto 's mutants succeeds in being memorable.In conclusion X-Men is not a great movie . Brian Singer is definitely an overrated director (Usual Suspects was also OK but nothing great) but I have sincere hopes that the sequel will be better . If however you are sucker for comics - movies (like I am) see it . It is not Batman but it is not Howard the Duck either .X - MEN        7 / 10
P.S    In case you wonder about the corny line ` Do you know what happens to a toad when it is hit by a thunder ? ....... What happens to everything else' . This wasn't in the script . The rational explanation comes from the original version . The plausible answer is ` It croaks'.",Null,1,2,22 May 2003
Spider-Man," Well done - can't wait for the sequel
","Directed by Sam RaimiWritten by David KoeppStarring: Tobey Maguire , Willem Dafoe , Kirsten Dunst and James FrancoAfter years of anticipation and a never ending court battle concerning the legal rights ,  a big budget cinematic adaptation of the well known comics superhero has finally made it to the movie theaters . First of all I should say I was never much of a Spider-man fan , I have never read comics but is there any person on earth who doesn't know the red clad hero who jumps from building to building ? I doubt so . My only knowledge of Spider-man was some cartoon show where he makes a dynamic trio with Iceman and Fire-Star . I am not aware of anyone of Spidey's enemies and I was not familiar with his origin and motives . Nevertheless I am keen on comics generally and I always like seeing comics characters materialize on celluloid . So I got really excited when I heard that the project FINALLY got green-lighted and that Sam Raimi eventually took it upon him to shoot the Spider-man motion picture . I will have to admit that most of the comments are 100% right . Spider-man (2002) may not be a GREAT film but it sure is a good one (and it beats the hell out of the overrated and disappointing 2000's X-Men) .I don't think the plot is significant . The movie remains as faithfully to its comics origins as it could be and it satisfies both the hardcore well-knowing fans and the uninitiated like I am . Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy 17 year old student ,  not much accepted by his social environment and constantly being picked by his bullies classmates . He has a secret crush on the beautiful girl next door Mary Jane `M.J.' Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly knows he exists . When he is bitten by a mutated super spider he is bestowed with special powers like climbing on windows with his bare (albeit sticky) hands , ejecting spider nets from his arms , incredible acrobatic agility and enhanced danger-approaching instinct. While he tries to adjust to his newly obtained powers he finds himself caught in a war that a fiendish super criminal called the Green Goblin has declared against him . The Green Goblin is a maniac who wreaks havoc and kills innocent people using military equipment and weaponry . He believes that Spider-Man is the only real threat and wants to bring him down . The Green Goblin is actually the alter-ego of Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) a very wealthy businessman / scientist who has started developing a split personality and the deranged Green Goblin becomes more and more dominant driving him to madness . Norman's son is Harry (James Franco) who coincidentally is Peter's best friend and classmate . So Spider-Man will try to stop the Green Goblin before he kills more civilians and simultaneously will try to get Mary Jane's attention .That's it folks . The film spends much more time on the love story between Peter and Mary Jane and less on action . I always like character development and human relationships unfolded in superhero films but a little more action wouldn't heart either . Basically we see Spider-Man beat up some random thugs on alley streets and that's it . The balloon sequence in the middle of the film is nice but awfully reminiscent of Batman (1989) . I wish there were more epic battles between Spider-man and Green Goblin with more explosions . Some other things I didn't like either were :
1) Even worse CGI SFX than the robot soldiers in the Phantom Menace !!! I never thought it could happen but here it is . The shots of Spider-Man in the beginning of the film jumping from the top of a building to another is a lame cartoon that will not convince even a 3 year old viewer . I cannot describe how laughable and fake this Spider-man cartoon is : you will have to see for yourselves .2) The acting is average from all the actors . None of them manages to deliver fully the dramatic depth of the characters as scripted by the writer. The worst performance belongs to Willem Dafoe . His mirror communication scene was nicely scripted but Dafoe is extremely bad and unconvincing . What exactly happened here ? I liked him in Body of Evidence and Speed II but his talents seem to have been erased in this film . I will have to admit that some of the Green Goblin's lines gave me the creeps but can anyone assure me that it was really him under the suit (or his voice for that matter) ? Maguire's  and Dunst's acting is better but still mediocre . Speaking of the duo , one other flaw is that they don't have enough chemistry together (like Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder) . If they made a more fitting pair the screen time spent in their romance would be more worthily used . And if James Franco has the most impact screen presence is because his character requires for him to sit back and look calm and cool (and it is obvious that's the reason why they cast him) . The secondary characters like Peter's uncle and aunt act OK but that newspaper editor was too annoying to like him.3) The Green Goblin is never developed and is not much of a formidable foe . Maybe it was intentional to give him little screen time in order not to pull another scene-stealer (a la Joker) and give all the focus on Spider-Man . Unfortunately a great action film always needs a powerful evil character to be the opposition AND the driving force for the hero's existence .
Aside from these flaws the movie has all the features of a good blockbuster . The red suit of Spider-Man is faithful and really convinces us that the character has come to life ! There are some good scenes like the one where Peter finally beats up one the bullies in school . My favorite scene in the movie is a great surprise and that's why I cannot give it away. All I can say if you haven't watched the film , is the sequence where the Green Goblin sings `The itsy , bitsy spider.' . I also digged the final duel between Spider-Man and Green Goblin . Without being too violent it is an exciting fight , larger-than-life and worth our money . I just wish the rest of the movie reached the same adrenaline levels . Despite a lackluster performance , Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker . He suits the geeky looks the character has and convinces as a 17 year old with continually growing power (physical and personal) . The film has an obvious open end as a set up for the sequel . Much like some recent blockbusters like the Matrix or X-Men the first film is clearly an introductory chapter wanting to lure the audience to a whole franchise . You wait for more action in the next film , more exploitation of the potential of the story and you have a curiosity to find out where the relationships between the protagonists will lead . Spider-Man however manages to rise above the aforementioned films . Why ? Because it is a GOOD introduction . Where X-Men made the mistake of under using  10 characters without any success , Spider-Man has ONE main character . This is what I like most about Raimi's film . We follow Peter Parker from the very beginning . We have a taste of his life before the drastic change occurs and then we have the transformation in front of our eyes full play ! There is not a single superhero film that bothered to show us the beginning of the character . Obviously they thought it would be dull for the already initiated comic book fans but they were wrong . Yes there are other films with scenes were the motives were explained like Batman and some opening establishing scenes like the first Superman . But Raimi's Spider-Man is unique : we SEE Peter Parker training with his super powers , trying to control them and we even get to see him pick his costume . Now I will keep my reservations because I have yet to see the recent batch of Marvel comic-book adaptations like Daredevil or Hulk but for now Spider-Man is the best introducing film you will find . The metaphor about the responsibility of a teenager turned into a mature adult is also explored . The realistic approach is successful here . First of all the first thing Peter does with his powers is to try earning money . Only later he decides to use them for the city 's good and safety . Secondly despite some nitpicking from fans it is quite logical that Spider-man's web-shooting is an organic power . Peter is just 17 and as much as he is supposed to be a science genius he wouldn't have the money or the technology to invent some synthetic web shooters . The Green Goblin outfit sure looks like a Power Ranger suit but it is also realistic as it is a piece of military equipment and not a Halloween costume . New York City is depicted as a shiny town and establishes a truly existing environment for the story to take place .Spider-Man (2002) for all its weaknesses is a good film with some of the best narrative I have seen . The voice-overs by Maguire help us identify with him even more . The film is better than some other comic book flicks like Phantom or Spawn (not entirely their fault since these characters are less appealing and therefore less known) Dick Tracy , The Mask or the Shadow (good idea but mediocre script / execution) or over hyped blockbusters like the X-Men . It will not be a classic like Superman II or Batman but it is one of the best of the bunch of the `comic-book' genre . I rank it up there with the 3 Batman sequels , Judge Dredd and the original Superman .

Dark City," Impressive mix of a fantasy film and a psychological thriller
","Although the basic plot seems nothing more than a typical twilight zonish subject expanded to a 90 minutes time slot Alex Proyas succeeds in the narration of this strange story . His assistant technicians should take the credit for pulling off this never-boring-for-the-viewer movie with their decent art direction and dark cinematography  .I will begin by saying that CAUTION : this is NOT an action film . If you except the fact that our lead John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) is constantly on the run to escape from his pursuers , there are no bombs , gunfire etc etc . If you want to see a typical sci fi  adrenaline-packed blockbuster see the 'Matrix' . AHHH! Here we come to the point . This atmospheric predecessor of the Matrix proved that you don 't need gratuitous action scenes with kung fu and corny acrobatic SFX to keep the audience 's attention ( however I would like to point out that it is unfair to say the Wachowski Bros ripped off Dark City because drafts of the script existed ever since 1996) . Anyway Dark City starts off as a psychological thriller . John Murdoch has a strange kind of amnesia . He can 't remember who he is , he is wanted for a murder he can 't recall committing , he has a wife who doesn 't recognize (played by Jennifer Connelly) and he has an unexplained desire to visit a place from his supposed childhood (Shell Beach) .From the beginning though it becomes clear that we are watching a fantasy film with supernatural forces . I won 't say more however in order not to spoil the fun . The similarities between Matrix and Dark City are evident (3 leading characters , the pursuers/baddies , a massive hallucination) . But whereas Matrix was an IMPUDENT ripoff from Star Wars , Terminator and Nightmare on Elm Street mish-mashed with pseudo religious hints , Dark City can stand on its own thanks to the imaginative direction and mostly due to the mystery factor which keeps the viewer hooked until the end . (no need for 'cool' rayban glasses or black capes) . Of course this doesn 't mean that the Proyas film isn 't inspired from other films . Dark City deals with the question 'what makes us human' and is slightly reminiscent of Blade Runner . Personally I believe that Dark City answered the question much better than the 1982 film (no need for slow pace and foggy frames here as well!) . The prophecy about the ONE who is going to save man kind seems to be taken by Dune ( I am not saying Star Wars because we don 't have the plot device mentor-training-student ) . There are also some plot elements which I can 't give away but I will say that reminded me a little bit of 'Close Encounters of the 3rd type' , 'The Shadow' with Alec Baldwin and the villains seem to be cousins of Uncle Fester from the Addams Family .The art direction seems to be an amalgam from Gotham City(the most famous in-joke about Batman finally materializes : a city which never sees the daylight!!!) and 1920 's Detroit fashion : the cars , costumes and hats (the barber shop reminded me of the Untouchables) . The edition is nice with the flashbacks popping out here and there , the cinematography is beautiful (especially in all scenes near or on the river) but I believe the SFX needed a bit reworking . Anyway there are a couple of sequences you will never forget and the narration has the nice amount of mystery , action and suspense . Rufus Sewell performs a difficult task . Despite his plain looks and unattractive characteristics he gives a likeable character who struggles to save his life and memories in a messy environment. No real star power or bulged body or handsome face (Harrison Ford anyone ?). If the film was more mainstream we would have a Bruce Willis or Brad Pitt in the role . Unfortunately one of the liabilities is that Mr Sewell carries the film exclusively on his shoulders . William Hurt seems as a forced-in decorative role with no real purpose . I liked seeing Jennifer Connelly who was lost after the amazing Labyrinth back in 1986 , but unfortunately she isn 't given much to do . Both Connelly and Hurt are wasted and end up as nothing more than extended cameos . The actors behind the villains could have been interesting if we could tell them apart !!! The only supporting actor I found interesting was that strange cop and I hated seeing him vanish so quickly . Finally Kiefer Sutherland : his dyslexic character is obviously inspired by Mouse , the retarded blond adolescent who lived at the underground society in TV 's Beauty and the Beast with Linda Hammilton . Sutherland is sometimes irritating with the way he talks although he has the key role . (at least the plot twist was ingenious) .Enough said I think . If you want to see an independent production , entertaining and simultaneously thought-provoking see Dark City . To its credit this is a short film obviously not wanting to have unnecessary interludes of action to fill in the screen time . It is the good way of telling an inventive fantasy story without being a boring flagging depiction of a one dimensional gimmick (cough , cough , Gattaca , cough , cough ) . Oh , and before I forget my hat off to Alex Proyas for delivering a much better film than the Crow .8.5 / 10",8,0,2,18 May 2002
Aliens," The best action/fantasy thriller EVER !!! ( some small spoilers )
","This movie was made in 1986 but noone has managed to top it ever since. Not only it is probably the best of its kind but it DEFINATELY surpassed the horrible , boring 'Alien' ( I know I may get shot for that ) Ridley Scot 's film has a couple of CLASSIC moments (e.g. the facehugger on Kane 's face , the chestbursting , the death of Ash and the explosive finale ) but otherwise it is a BORING BORING BORING picture , slow and manytimes inbearable . Just think of it . If the story of Aliens was used for the first part and vice versa everyone would regard Alien as a mediocre sequel ( just like Alien 3 ) . Think of it . Alien was definately a classic because it simply happened to be the first in the row . But classic does not necessarily mean good . This  does not mean that the James Cameron version has not its flaws. Basically the script takes the idea and reproduces it ( more aliens , more weapons etc ) There are many similarities as well in the basic plot ( a double -faced traitor , an explosive finale , the alien comes on board , the alien is neutralised in precisely the same way )I would dare to say at all cost that it is  simply a rehash (or a remake why not ? )  . So what makes Aliens so special ?First of all the direction . I believe this is definately Cameron 's best job to date . The SFX are something beyond excellent they are convincing . You really BELIEVE that these creatures exist . Especially in the final breathtaking scene ( I won 't reveal it here ) . All I can say is that you will find yourself HOOKED in the screen . I don 't think that there is a most convincing 'fake' scene , not in an action film but a movie generally . Sigourney Weaver is an ever - reliable actress and she does her best here . Her Ripley is one of the most 'everyday' courageful and brave people in cinematic history . I think 50 % of the film 's success is due to her perfomance . She was BORN to play Ripley !!!Some story elements: Ripley wakes up after 57 years of hypersleep when she is rescued by 'blind luck' . The company people want to know what happened and why Nostromo was destroyed . This is one of the most 'entertaining' (in a very peculiar way) sequences in film history (you don't know whether to laugh or cry) because she tells the same story again and again but nobody believes her !!! Ripley is still haunted by bad dreams with the Alien . She decides to escort the Aliens ' destruction mission as an advisor since she has advanced knowledge on the subject . With a group of Marines they land on a space colony only to find out that the habitants are killed by those dreadful monsters . The Aliens have reproduced themselves by infesting the planet with eggs , facehuggers and babies . The advanced weaponry unfotunately cannot save them . After a few typical combat scenes the force is dwelled by half and there is only one way to save themselves .There are solid and ( I would say quite good ) perfomances from all the other actors . Paul Reiser (Burk) , Michael Biehn (Hicks) , Bill Paxton (Hudson) , Carrie Hehn (Newt) and Lance Henricsen(Bishop) . There are some unforgettable lines which make the rollercoaster even better ' Stay away from me Bishop ' , ' So why don't you put HER in charge ? ' , ' I don 't know which species is worse . At least you don 't see them fucking over a percentage ' , ' Stay away from my ship you BITCH 'etc.Now the cons : 1)some of you may find the dark cinematography irritating and hard to follow 2) Despite the suspence , some action scenes are quite predictable ( the first combat with the aliens , the facehugger attacks Ripley scene , the trapped in the lab waiting for the alien assault scene etc ) . 3) The script does not avoid some plot holes which seem to torture almost every sci-fi adventure : why don 't they blow up the planet after the first deaths ( especially since the leader dies ), how Bishop escaped the Aliens through the conductors ( maybe because he doesn 't have body temperature ? ) , why don 't they think of the escape vessel immediately since most are dead etc ,etc . 4) It is quite predictable who lives in the end .Despite the defects the story is so beautifully told and the finale is so breathtaking and convincing that you will find yourself sucked by the illusion of cinema .  See it after midnight and preferably alone. You will enjoy it more . ALIENS ROCKS !!!9/10",9,0,0,21 May 2001
Liar Liar," Hilarious ! (and one of Carrey 's best)
","I am not a HUGE fan of Carrey . He did quite well in 'the Mask' but I am really not a sucker for dum comedies with rubber-faced comedians (like Dumb and Dumber) . I also believed he was mediocre as the Riddler in Batman Forever and his stupid grimaces hurt quite a bit the 'Truman Show' . This overacting was uncalled in Peter Weir 's film but what do we have here ? A solidly written comedy which really fits Carrey and gives him the chance to exploit his comedic talents but without being annoying . The result is (for the most part) amusing .OK lets recap the plot . Fletcher Reede (Carrey) is a successful lawyer who lies not only in courthouse but to everyone he knows including his colleaques and boss who he simply uses as a ladder for his career , his secretary whom he doesn 't give a raise , even his 5 year old son Max . Fletcher is divorced and Max lives with his mother Audrey (Maura Tierney) . Audrey divorced him because he didn 't invest much of his time to her but the problem still remains the same for Max . Fletcher is an absorbed workaholic and never finds time for his son (not even quality time that is). He keeps going back on his promises about picking up Max from school , playing baseball with Max etc , etc (If you have seen Hook with Robin Williams you already get the idea) . Audrey is fed up with Fletcher and has decided to move to Boston . Apparently Max will see his dad as frequently as now so she doesn 't have hesitations . Laura wants to start a new life with her new boyfriend Jerry . Jerry is a very ordinary calm little guy and although they are not officially engaged , they seem to be moving on tying the knot . At Max 's 5th birthday , Fletcher once again breaks his word and doesn 't arrive at the party . Max is so disappointed that the wish he makes blowing the candles on his cake is ' I wish that for 1 day my dad wouldn 't tell lies ' . The wish actually works and Fletcher is unable to spout (or even write!) even the simplest lie for the unbearable time course of 24 whole hours !!! The side effects are evident from the first moment since he reluctantly tells the truth to every question (and as the movie progresses we learn about other side effects due to this weird curse) . This is nearly the beginning for Fletcher 's torture since the truths embarrass him in front of the courtroom , his colleaques , his mother , his secretary and the police officer who checks his unpaid parking tickets !!!The premise was intriguing and Carrey is given free reign to spout the unpleasant truths in the most tragically funny way !! Carrey is superb in most of scenes like when he talks on the phone but he fails in others . One example is the scene with the pen which was badly staged . I would also like to complain about the scene where he beats his self up in the bathroom . It is totally unnecessary and at the worst case they should have at least shortened it . I especially liked the fact that the movie goes straight into action because the introductory scenes cover the first 10 or so minutes . Most of the consequences of Max 's wish are hilariously entertaining . The film is also short in order not to drag and be boring . Although it is inevitable that most of the viewers will simply focus on the gags and Carrey 's morphasms the writers pulled off some enjoyable messages . The satire on the profession of the lawyers is apparent . The usage and the benefit of lying in the 'adult world' are also pointed out . As the plot unfolds we see Carrey actually redeeming his relationship with his fellow lawyers and his family even he was forced to outmouth bold and vulgar truths . For a family comedy Liar Liar actually contains a sensible amount of profanity although IMO it was used properly and rightfully ' I am gonna take it up to my tail pipe ' . If you have small children think twice before you let them see the film.Acting wise the team has done extremely well . This is not simply Carrey 's one man show - if it was it would fail . All the supporting characters chip in with their performances . Justin Cooper as Max plays convincingly the 5 year old character . Laura Tierney as Audrey is solid too . The show seems to be stolen by Jason Bernard as the strict Judge . He acts very well and is the nemesis of Carrey since if Fletcher embarrasses himself in court , the Judge 's wrath will be hard on him . Anne Haney is also a sensible supporting cast member as Greta , Fletcher 's secretary . She basically copycats her own role in 'Mrs Doudtfire' (she was the social worker) but nevertheless with splendid results . She has more screen time and her constrained behavior is a hilarious opponent over Carrey 's fast and furious attitude . The rest of the cast is passable . Cary Elwes is literally unrecogniseable as Jerry , Audrey 's wannabe new husband . He appears briefly but is quite convincing in a very unusual for his standards buffoonish character .Liar , Liar is one of the most entertaining comedies of the 90 's . It is worth seeing even by non Carrey fans . For a fun evening with many laughs I recommend renting it.LIAR , LIAR 8 / 10",8,0,0,20 February 2003
Good Will Hunting," Good movie (although not a classic)
","The story of this film is so simple (and contrived) , so everyday , so condensated , that you can write the plot summary on the back of a matchbox (!!!) . You see exactly what you KNOW that you will see . Nevertheless the result is very good and effective .PLOT : Will Hunting ( Mat Damon )is a 20 year old with problematic domestic background . He lives alone and is a restless 'boem' like character who has had a couple of problems with the law in the past . What many don 't know is that he is a mathematical genious and his IQ is much beyond average . When a professor in University discovers this genious accidentally , he wants to promote him . Of course Will is reluctant as always : he doesn 't believe much in himself and he refuses to cooperate. Naturally (as it always happens) his friends like the character of Ben Affleck encourage him to exploit his talents and leave them behind , since he deserves something better (how original !!)  ' You have the golden lottery ticket in your hands , but you are afraid of going to cash it in ' . Middleway he forms an erotic relationship with a girl (Minnie Driver) but (what a surprise!!!!) the relationship fails due to his unobediant and non-trusting character' So where are your 12 brothers ????? ' (!!!!) she asks him wanting to expose his lies and his lack of trust . Perhaps the most original part is that the lead attends a psychiatrist . After he changes 5 doctors (noone could stand him !!!!) he ends up in the hands of Robin Williams who was witty enough to push the proper buttons and finally communicate with Will . Robin Williams gives not only the best performance of the film but one of the best in his carreer . The session scenes are DEFINATELY the best ones in the movie . Although when the screenplay was written the filmakers had no idea who the role would end up to , now I really cannot think of anyone else than Robin Williams playing the shrink that successfully . The supporting cast is credible . They are simply there to serve the movie and not outshine the central character (intentional probably) . Mat Damon is quite good . He convinces mostly as a spoiled brat who wants to poke his fun to everyone , doesn 't want commitments with anyone and simultaneously he is a misunderstood genious who can't fit in anywhere : the incarnation of a problem child . As I said this is no classic (like Crammer Vs Crammer or the Rainman ) but is is one of the best social dramas (like the Prince of Tides ) Hollywood has ever made . The direction is subtle ( VERY subtle ) and so is the supporting cast . So if you add the cliches of the script what do you have ? I believe the movie lays on the shoulders of Damon and Williams . Their chemistry works and gives us a dramatic story with dignity and not melodramatic tensions . If you are not convinced there is at least one reason why you must see this film . ****SPOILER ALERT***** In the end we see something extremely rare : Will finally bends his lack of communication he bursts into tears . His shrink hugs him tightly like a father figure and tries to confort him ******* This is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinema simply because it is REAL (although none dares to put it in films because they don 't want to show a man crying) . Even for that GWH deserves a solid8 / 10",8,0,2,12 July 2001
Scream 2," You have to have a sequel !!!
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ... as Stew said in the original Scream . This movie was a complete story by its own . But after the success of Scream the continuation chapters were inevitable . Although Scream 2 obviously does not compare with the first part it has some major improvements . The first is that the plot unfolds much more continuusly than the first. There is not an inch of dead time since the non action scenes are used for the dramatic development of the characters like the theater scenes . In Scream the parts where Sidney (Neve Campbell) was whining about her mother were kind of annoying . Also Jamie Kennedy was kind of irritating as Randy the last time . Here he is more mature and reliable without overacting and screaming . Also (thank God) there are less quotes from other movies just the necessary amount .PLOT : 2 years after the gruesome murders in Woodsborow the events of Scream were made a movie called 'Stab' based on the best seller book by the reporter Gail Weathers (Corteney Cox) . During the avant premiere a gory murder takes place in the most tragic way ( I won 't say more than this is better than the Drew Barrymore opening!!) Soon it becomes clear that a psychopath has decided to be the successor of the killer in Stab and has focused on the University campus where Sidney and Randy are now students . He is a copycat killer following precisely the same methods . The threatening phone calls , the black costume with the ghostface mask and the knife-using bloody slasher killings. Gail Weathers arrives on the scene to help the police and fulfil her own ambitions as well . The story is very good and the cast reunion is effective. The psychological horror is once again inherent : the maniac can be literally anyone . An obsessed movie fan who sadistically wants to poke his fun to Sidney by reviving her worst nightmares . It is very chilling since most of us have suppressed fears and subconciously always live in the sheer terror they might resurrect . Apart this psychological factor the writer made sure to give a motive almost to everyone . Even the most unconfessed motives are apparent . For example Dewey (David Arquette) and Randy are never exposed for their possible obscure motives but anyone with a common sense of logic can guess their motives for being the killers . Despite a few original scenes there are more chliches than the last time , unfortunately . E.g. Cicy is a supporting cast so you know she doesn 't stand a chance to live . The trapped in the car scene no matter how suspensful , it is contrived and very stupid . And finally the ending : the biggest flaw is that the killer 's motive is stupid or even better inexistant . There is a shocking revelation but it does not compensate for the bad taste the ending leaves us . It is not only disappointing but it is unrealistic and , even worse , not suspenseful. As soon as the killer is unmasked the agony freezes . In Scream that point was simply the beginning for the edge-of-your-seat climax .I will have to warn you though that the fault is not the writer 's , at least totally . Kevin Williamson 's original draft is rumoured to be darker , had a different killer and better ending with a cliffhanger to be answered in #3 (it is obvious the obsession of Williamson with the Star Wars trilogy) . Probably the director or the producers changed it for PC reasons . Overall Scream 2 is a good sequel . It is worth seeing to keep up with the story . It has some good scenes but it is utterly destroyed by the ending . Bewarned . I haven 't seen Scream 3 but I hope it will restore the memory of the series .SCREAM II          7.5 / 10",8,0,0,5 June 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Masterpiece
","I can 't say much more than I regard it as the perfect movie . It is a beautiful Gothic fairy tale . The success is not much due to the script . The plot based of course to Bram Stoker 's book is not very original . The fact that the monster falls in love with a woman who wants to save him is a well known formula . But the direction is so powerful and the actors gave larger than life , poetic performances who enhanced the power of a story and made the film divine kind of an ancient Greek drama . Sometimes overacting is not necessarily bad .The direction is very good on the acting side but I believe that the real kudos will have to go to the technicians : first of all the sets and costumes create a convincing victorial London and a haunted / scary Transylvania . The make ups of Dracula are very good . But the gothic cinematography and music score are the ones which steal the show 70 % of the success of the film is due to the atmosphere which photography and music create . Who can forget the beginning sequence ? Who can forget the marriage scene (with the most intense music I 've ever heard) . Who can forget the finale ? Coppola made a splendid job for the supervision and guidance of those professionalistic jobs . The SFX are credible . One of the greatest charms is that you can 't easily designate who is the lead . The center moves continuusly . The movie starts with Jonathan (Keanu Reeves) who visits the tour of Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) . Then the count comes to London and approaches the beautiful Mina (Winona Ryder) . Mina and Dracula are somehow the focus until the middle of the film Dr Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) enters and becomes the lead . The acting is uniformly beautiful and very effective . As I said overacting was the only way to give this story the biblical proportions it deserved . Oldman and Ryder are very good , the underrated Keanu Reeves is quite credible (and stop those silly complaints about the bad accent-he IS half British in reality you know) Hopkins is somehow the scene - stealer because his character is wise and funny . Coppola exploited to maximum the make-up facilities and gave all the sides of the vampire with the transformations : the monster , the aggressive hunter , the eternal being , the human who needs love , the loneliness , and the hopeless life of living in the dark . The good direction is also apparent in some contrived (written) scenes which become chilling and powerful .E.g. when Dracula reads the letter and learns that Mina is gone he cries from anger and orders winds to blow. The winds obey and a room full of candles goes to the dark . In the end we have shots of the sunset which are also chilling . If you like romantic stories then stop reading and see it now It is pure masterpiece .10 / 10",10,1,3,8 June 2001
Scream," A true masterpiece (some minor spoilers)
","What else can I say that has not been said before ? Scream is almost perfect. I think the movie managed not to revive the horror genre as many said , but something even better : born a new kind of film , the mystery / horror . We have seen other movies with unidentified serial killers like Copycat . The brilliant idea of combining the mystery element with teenage stars representing the horror / slasher films is VERY functional . Many said that there are comedy elements and the movie is funny . I disagree because I think the writer wanted simply to make the film less scary at occasions so it would not be more entertaining. The heroes have seen many scary movies and know many cliches that are inherent in them . Personally think that the continuus quotes from other movies was a bit entertaining sometimes but very irritating other times and this is a big flaw . There are unforgettable lines like' It is a lot scarier WITHOUT a motive !! ' or ' Movies do NOT create psychos , they simply make psychos more inventive ' .I won 't tell much about the plot because the less you know the more you will enjoy it . Basically gruesome murders happen in a small American town . The maniac killer is dressed like a ghost : black cape and cowl and a white - faced mask a direct copy from the famous painting ' the scream ' . He is a pure sadist : makes threatening phone calls to his victims always asking them if they like scary movies . After he intimidates them and scares the s**t out of them , he attacks and slaughters them with a knife in full-of-panic-heartpumping-suspensful -bloody chase scenes . The killer can be really anyone . As Randy ( Jamie Kennedy ) says wittingly ' EVERYBODY IS A SUSPECT !!! ' . So far nothing special you may say . Here is the evidence you are wrong
1) The chase scenes despite the cliches are the most suspenseful in any film of the decade . Wes Craven proved that even the oldest and rehashed recipe can work magnificently if the ingredients are used properly.2) Finally a horror movie where the killer is a common mortal !!! If you hit him he will hurt . If you stab him he will bleed . If you shoot him he will die . At last ! Not some stupid unkillable ' boogeyman ' like Michael Myers in Halloween ( don 't get me wrong I like Halloween but it IS stupid ) .3) A horror movie with detective crime mystery . You don 't know who the killer is . Is it Billy ( Skeet Ulrich ) ? No , too obvious ! Is it Sidney 's father gone mad ? Maybe . No it maybe Randy gone crazy of all the thrillers he 's watching . Too obvious . Again Billy has a very mysterious eye look . But again is he . Is he not ? And how about Stew ( Mathew Lilard ) ? He seems a real wacko . And so on and on . The film keeps you guessing until the end . I believe the solution of the mystery was probably inspired of some Agatha Christie novels like 'Ten little niggers' and ' Crime Witness ' .3) The performances are very good especially Skeet Ulrich as Billy one of the most controversial characters ever seen . He is very enigmatic. By the way if his figure reminds you of something it is Johnny Depp. Excellent performances from Rose Mac Gowan ( Tatum ) and Neve Campbell ( Sidney ) . Adequate acting by Jamie Kennedy , Mathew Lilard , David Arquette as the Deputy Dewey and Corteney Cox as the pesky reporter Gail Weathers who sees the story as a skoop for her carreer . Despite the acting the characters are very strong ( except Dewey ) and very memorable .4) I have read many comments and critics about the film but noone has made a comment about the psychological terror . There is a widespread threat throughout the whole movie . First of all the Ghostface is very scary . He seems like a divine supernatural figure . When Casey ( Drew Barrymore ) unmasks him in the beginning we are almost sure that he is a person she knows . But the most horrifying part in this excellent story is that despite the numerous suspects and the hints that the script provides us to keep changing our suspicions , the killer can be literally anyone : just a psychopath who has spotted these friends and wants to have his sick fun . Maybe he is even a guy from out of town. The threat is exposing itself when the murderer is in front of Sidney sweeping the blood of his knife implying directly , ' You are next '. I have never seen such a frightfully intense scene in a film before : the danger is HERE ! The atmosphere really convinces you that this can happen to anyone .5) There are some excellent original scenes but I won 't give them away. All I can say is that the Drew Barrymore opening is regarded as a classic . Something I would like to comment is that finally the heroines do something I always wondered why not in other horror films : when the killer corners them , they simply kick him in the sensitive area.6) The revelation of the killer is simply SHOCKING . As for the climax I can assure you that it is the most nerve - shattering you have ever seen . You will probably need a sleeping pill to sleep afterwards because you will be frightened to death by the twisted mind a person can have ( the PSYCHOLOGICAL TERROR I mentioned above ) and moreover the final action scene is going to steal your breath and have your heart crazy . Trust me ! You will remember it as long as you live !A few weaknesses : Some scenes are very contrived like the murder of the Headmaster . Other scenes are quite boring like when Sidney is whining about her family background something which annoyingly holds the plot development back . But I guess we may forgive that . How can anyone NOT love this movie or even worse hate it ? I believe the only ones who hated it are people who simply don 't like action films or mysteries . But for you who like thrillers this is definately a must see.S C R E A M    F O R E V E R                                 9 / 10",9,0,0,24 May 2001
Blade Runner," Good visuals don 't make a good movie
","The one line summary says it all . Ridley Scott with the aid of a brilliant crew (director of photography , SFX team and a decent music score) managed to shoot one of the most astonishingly impressive films ever but with a thin paper plot and an unnecessarily slow pace . It could as well be a short film. As it is it's just a 40 minutes story stretched to a 2 hours time slot .First the positive points : Blade Runner gives an original and splendid mix of stylistic themes . It combines the film noir atmosphere of the 1940 's (the detective who 'falls for the wrong woman' , the clouded alley streets etc) with futuristic sets (flying cars , colourful lights , advanced computer technology) and strangely it maintains the present day reality of a detective thriller of the 80 's or even the 90 's . The result is a wonderful surrealistic background , timeless and not at all dated . This diachronic atmosphere is a very successful depiction of the vision of many famous sci-fi writers , and I am not referring necessarily to Philip Dick . Sci - fi writers usually describe futuristic societies with an amalgam of elements from different historic periods and this is exactly the case with this film . I will have to shake hands with the SFX crew because the overhead take in the beginning of the movie where we get a panoramic view of the colourful-lighted scyscrapers is unbelievably good . Even now , 20 years later , when technology has evolved so much , I still haven 't seen such a convincing simulated image in a movie . For example Judge Dredd (1995) and Fifth Element (1997) tried to walk on the same path but with limited success . But the real kudos must go to the cinematographer because his work is in one word excellent . The cinematography is simply excellent and I doubt if it will be ever topped . It is the soul of the movie and the most representative sample of the spirit the film-makers tried to capture . Unfortunately due to a lame script they failed . Which leads us to the negative points : slight spoilers coming .This film tries to be philosophical and mind intriguing but it simply doesn 't work . The silence and the slow pace add nothing to the film . No , the film doesn 't pose metaphysic questions about the essence of life and the borders between artificial intelligence and real existence , as the fans and the snobbish critics insist (keep in mind that back in the 1982 they panned it) . The only controversial scene is when Dechard(Harrison Ford) shoots down the dancer Zhora played by Joanna Cassidy. This is a violent bloody murder and one of them most depressing killing scenes in cinematic history . It is obvious that the 'termination' of a replicant is still homicide of an intelligent entity . If the rest of the film managed to retain the same climate it would indeed be 'philosophic' . Unfortunately we have a letdown to scattered scenes of erotic hypnotized innuendo between Dechard and Rachael and inane sleepy dialogue between Roy (Rutger Hauer) and Pris(the unrecognizable Daryl Hannah). All this leads to a disappointing anti-climactic finale . No , it is not at all poetic and if the idea was good *******spoiler**** Roy ultimately saving Decard******* the execution was horrible . I believe the main problem of the film was the acting . Although the casting was successful none of the actors gave a memorable performance . They all sleep-walked through their roles except from the a** kicking Cassidy . Now I reckon they were supposed to be deadpan to fit in the film noir climate but  it didn 't take . Although Ford was likeable in his short haircut and had a weird chemistry with Sean Young they didn 't capture the viewer 's heart to the point they should . The ONLY character you root for is actually Sebastian (William Sanderson) who suffers from untimely anility at the age of 25 and hosts the replicants in his house. He is terrified of what is happening but can 't do anything to prevent it. I haven 't read the novel but I have downloaded the original screenplay and there are differences which would have made a slightly better film *********SPOILERS read at your own risk*****************1) The truth test to certify if Rachael was a replicant was quite longer e.g. it contained the lines 'What would you do if a wasp landed on your hand'  'I would slap it and kill it'2) There was another replicant called Mary who lived with Roy and Pris in Sebastian 's house . She was dispatced easily before Pris jumps -literally- on Dechard . She had about 5 lines throughout the whole film so she was easily omitted .3) The scene in the bar where Decart meets the replicant was also longer. The replicant had cockroaches for pets and he urged Ford to kiss one of them ! Ultimately Deckard was the one who shot the replicant and not Rachael.4) Roy didn 't only kill his creator scientist but also all his assistants and his family including his cute little 8 year old son . Sebastian actually was not murdered by him in that incident but unfortunately he inevitably bited the dust in the finale by the stray bullets from Dechart who gatecrashed Sebastian 's home .5) The final duel between Roy - Dechart was actually a more successful shoot 'em up scene than those dreadfully sophomoric lines by Rutger Hauer who broke two fingers of Ford and suddenly he stopped for no apparent reason wanting pretentiously to show the supremacy of the replicants to the humble human kind . ****************************************************************** I cannot understand why everyone bashed the film 's happy ending and said it left unanswered questions . If you want to know the original script had the two leads go to a snowy forest . Dechart leaves and Rachael commits suicide with a gun since this was their common decision as the best solution !!!! The movie would end with a voice-over narration from Ford ' I was glad because now they wouldn 't be able to set their hands upon her '  (and harm her) . Would you prefer THAT ??? As i said impressive eye candy is not enough for a good film . BR is a landmark but just like the case with the horrible dull 'Alien' (at least BR is watchable) a groundbreaking 'classic' is not always a good movie . All in all a rather disappointing7.5 / 10Don 't expect much of a story and you will like it . Oh , I almost forgot *****spoiler****** Dechart IS a replicant . In the middle of the film in his house when he talks with Rachael ,  Rachael 's red-shine in the eyes is shown and then Dechard 's eyes come to screen and indisputably the same red shine is CLEARLY VISIBLE**************",7,6,14,28 February 2002
The Matrix," Entertaining average film
","Just like the case with the vastly overrated Blade Runner : professional job from a couple of good technicians but nothing more . I will have to admit that the script had some potential but the quite amateurish direction by the Wachowski Brothers almost ruined the entire effort . Before I summarize the plot , I would like to point out that I am extremely upset with the comments 'Philosophical' , 'thought provoking' . ARE YOY FEELING OK ???? Do you seriously believe that the script is 'complex' and the film 'requires more than one viewing' !!!!!!?????? (just like the case with the overrated Usual Suspects which is as simple and obvious as a cockroach on a white carpet) . If that 's so then I will strongly discourage you from EVER watching 'Twelve Monkeys' , 'Dune' or 'Sphere' because inevitably your brain cells will short circuit . It seems like the majority of sci-fi lovers have never read sci-fi short stories !!! The concept that we all live in a virtual illusional reality is not at all original . I can recite numerous examples but I will just stick to ' Marianna ' , a very short story by Fritz Lang where the heroine discovers that her mansion and her husband were holographic hallucinations and even herself was nothing but a wish coming true . The terrifying truth was that her real self (from were she was projected) was institutionalized in an asylum and was treated with an alternative personality/wish fulfillment program. Another short fantasy story claimed that very few people are indeed true and the rest were again the result of the subconscious materialization from the real ones' brains (their 'soulmates' conveniently coming true from the wishes of their counterparts) . I can go on and on but I don 't have to . Even for the movie fans which haven 't read sci-fi novels , it is impossible that they haven 't watched similar films . The infiltration in an alternative reality , artificially constructed , is present in 'Tron' (1982) with Jeff Bridges or in 'Total Recall' (1990) where the question what is real and what is not , is inherent throughout the film . The reviewers who see correlation between Matrix and Plato 's philosophical theories make me want to laugh . On top of that there are the ridiculous 'biblical symbolisms' the film-makers have insisted to include and publicize . I don 't think that by calling the ship 'Nabouchodonosor' or by killing off the hero and resurrecting him there are christianic references . Then Ripley in Alien Resurrection should be titled a Christ figure or we can suppose that the 'Janus' plan in 'Judge Dredd' should be regarded as a metaphor for the Roman Empire and the ruthless games between the Caesar and the Senate !!!!! And the by the way , the pattern of the (chosen) One is omnipotent in almost every sci-fi , with the most notable case Luke Skywalker in Star Wars . The dystopic future with machines taking over humans is of course 'borrowed' blatantly by the Terminator and the plot device 'Dying inside the virtual reality truly will kill you ' is apparently inspired from 'Nightmare on elm street' .Ripping - off so many movies and getting away with so called 'profound originality' (!) is a great achievement by the Wachowski Bros and proves how brain washing the critics can be . Excuse me but I just want to get it off my chest . I can 't stand seeing Matrix with an average of 8.5 while brilliant movies like 'Sphere' are stuck in 5.1 simply because the critics (for various reasons) decided to pan them .On to  the movie : we have a very large introduction (45 minutes maybe longer) before Neo (Keanu Reeves) gets to the 'real world' with the guidance of 'Morpheus' (Lawrence Fishburn) . If this introduction was shortened we would have a better movie . Anyway the middle part of the movie is undoubtly the best . After we learn the background of this strange society we are introduced to the submarine crew (Morpheus' friends) . I cannot spoil what happens next but I will say the moody atmosphere is highly successful . The climate is depressing , awe - inspiring and contains all the elements of a great existential drama .But hey this is Hollywood and the final 40 minutes are frittered away : after the 3 leads (Reeves , Fishburn , Moss) are trapped in the illusional world they are trying to escape and the film degenerates to a poor shoot 'em up with irritating constant noisy gunfire and silly video-gameish action scenes to satisfy the Playstation 13 year old freaks who probably digged them and pitched the Matrix to the aforementioned 8.5 . The karate scenes are decent but other than that the SFX stink BAD BAD BAD . Not only the repeated gunfire is annoying but the much hyped slow motion special effects are unbelievably c**ppy and patchily edited ('Scary Movie' to its credit did these scenes justice!!!!!!) One scene in the roof of a scyscraper is the perfect example . We see the bad guy shooting Neo . Then we see Neo verging backwards in slow motion . Then we hear Neo squeak 'Agh!!' and then we see the flight path of the bullet and we are supposed to presume that Neo was hit . Bottom case : we never actually SAW the bullet . Was the budget that low ?I will lie if I say that I didn 't enjoy the Matrix . But it is very overrated . Sets and costumes are adequate and despite of the many flaws in the direction there are memorable scenes like the visit to the Oracle 's home or the climactic chase of Neo and the baddies . I can 't say more in order not to reveal plot secrets . On the acting side : the 3 leads give quite solid performances , nothing great but passable but I believe the supporting cast stole the show . My personal favorite from the crew members is Tank and I am sad he won 't be in the sequel . Speaking of the sequel I will once again refer to the faults of the film . Overlong introduction ,weak finale , lousy SFX          BUT if they manage to jettison all these defects and they manage to reproduce the mystic , melancholic climate of the middle sequence then Matrix 2 will be a h**l of a sequel . Therefore I conclude with hope that in Matrix 2 they will wipe off the demerits and they will enhance the virtues to maximum . As it is Matrix is a fairly enjoyable could-have-done-much-more film .

Beetlejuice," After 10 or so times I watched it , still engaging - every fantasy fan should see it
","Directed by Tim Burton Written by Michael McDowell and Warren Skaaren Starring: Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and Michael KeatonA brilliant, fascinating and imaginative black comedy by Tim Burton, who proved unambiguously his great talents and went on to direct Batman . Beetlejuice is a satire dealing with the supernatural and is a modern fairy tale. Simultaneously it has a good share of hilarious moments and creepy scenes (like the snake scene).Although the basic plot may be regarded as quite original and funny, I am somehow compelled to point out that the basic concept seems to be loosely influenced by Oscar Wilde's 'The Canterville Ghost,' a rather dark fairy tale for kids (in precisely the same      tradition of Roald Dahl's creepy books like  'The Witches,' 'Matilda,' 'James and the Giant Peach' etc.) . It contains the hopeless attempts of an undead British lord who haunts his castle for centuries and callously scares off or even murders in gruesome ways all the subsequent habitants of the castle (including his very own descendants) only to fail to boot out a wacky American family of Republicans , who have bought the castle and have taken over his residence. Failed efforts to show them his presence include post-midnight roaming in the hallways hauling a rusty creaking metal chain and breaking the tea set in the living room. Sounds familiar?The film starts out as your typical romantic sitcom with your happy couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) being the ideal young husband and wife, full of love for each other and dreams. They live in a big house on an idyllic grassland near a cute little American hometown. The first plot twist comes 3 minutes later when Adam and Barbara are killed in a peculiar ironic sequence (which seems to have be taken by a Wile E. Coyote cartoon). Their spirits return in the house without remembering what happened. After a short period of research they realize that they are now ghosts and they have to endure a transitional state during which they are stuck in the house for good. As if there weren't enough problems already, a typical American yuppie called Charles Deitz (Jeffrey Jones) buys the house and sees the perfect chance to have a calm relaxing period from his anxious life in N.Y. Along with him comes his neurotic second wife Delia (Catherine O' Hara) who regards her stone monstrosities of statues as skilled art and will do anything to promote them, and his daughter from the first marriage Lydia (an alarmingly pale Winona Ryder in one of her first acting steps). Lydia is a miniature of a Black Widow, dressed in black and self acknowledges her existence as 'strange and unusual.' She hates her step-mother as much as Delia hates her. The two ghosts want to get rid of the intruders: after several unsuccessful 'hauntings' they have no other option but to contact a weird 'Bio-Exorcist' called Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) to help them. This propagates a series of uncontrollable situations which culminate into a hilarious climax.Beetlejuice is truly one of the most visually stunning and imaginative movies ever seen. Where to begin....well the cinematography is very good. The scenes in the afterlife world which depicts it as a surrealistic public service full of bureaucratic hints and tricks, is wonderful and gives us a strong satirical aspect of our world ( HELL! - even in the afterlife you need priority numbers !!!) along with beautiful-for-the-eye scenes. The director of photography made an excellent job with his colorful lighting. The sets, costumes and make up are exceptional. Who can forget the scorched 'Cigar Man' who 'is trying to quit?' Who can forget the room with the pit of 'exorcised souls' with the Escherish designs? Who can forget the ending sequence which is simultaneously creepy (an occult exorcism with paganistic spells taking place on a stormy night) and funny with Beetlejuice gatecrashing the session, evoking chaos.The SFX team really outdid themselves. For a 1988 movie we have some of the most original SFX to appear in screen for years. Further than the afterlife sequence we have hilarious scenes in Beetlejuice's miniature graveyard or the notorious whorehouse sequence or the climactic metamorphosis of the Beetlejuice to a neon lighted sparkling fun-fair hammer which sends the guests to the ceiling (the entire movie seems to be a roller-coaster with a 'terror train,' dark and kind of scary but great fun). Not to mention Delia's sculptures which come to life. There are other examples but I think I gave away too many spoilers. The music score by Danny Elfman gives the right two-natured feeling of a horror carnival the film has. There are some great existential moments which have a dreary moody feeling like when Lydia discovers the miniature city in the attic fully illuminated by white lights. The performances from all the actors are great. Winona Ryder shines here (no pun intended) in a very unusual role. The same goes for Michael Keaton as the fast talking deranged voluptuous Bio-Exorcist called Beetlejuice. The word 'perfect' can't do this man justice. See the movie and judge for yourselves.Although Beetlejuice drops in literally half way through the film (time-keep for yourselves if you don't believe me) he is the definition of a scene stealer and he even occupies the film title!! However I would like to underline that the best scenes in the film are the opening ones when the Maitlands try to figure out what is going on and struggle to adjust in the new status quo. Beetlejuice is a semi-dark masterpiece and a classic movie which can be viewed over and over many times. If you are a fan of dark satirical flicks like Gremlins then this is definitely a must-see for you. BEETLEJUICE     9.5 / 10",9,1,2,10 December 2003
