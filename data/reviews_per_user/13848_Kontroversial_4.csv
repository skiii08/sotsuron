Alien 3," My favorite ALIEN movie
","I never could understand all the hate that ALIEN 3 received. But then again I never could understand the top ratings for ALIENS and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, two of the most overrated movies ever.ALIEN 3 returns to the roots of the ALIEN franchise: it is not as action packed as ALIENS but it has more atmosphere, is more claustrophobic and darker, which I prefer. David Fincher delivers one of his best films here, next to SEVEN and FIGHT CLUB, I love his style, it's a huge enrichment to the ALIEN franchise. He gives the movie a very Gothic look which adds to the dark and unsettling climax. ALIEN 3 has a very somber and depressing mood with a shocking surprise right at the beginning of the movie. And it doesn't stop there. The ending is incredibly bleak and very untypical for Hollywood.The acting is superb, right on par with the original, but Sigourney Weaver delivers an even better performance here, as her character is tougher, more developed and gets to do more. Another great actor, Charles Dance also gives a superb performance, especially in the scenes he shares with Weaver, the two work well together. The 2003 Extended Cut/Special Edition improves the film even more adding approx. 30 mins of extra footage and is well worth the upgrade.",10,5,10,28 September 2016
Aliens," Good, but not nearly as great as Alien or Alien 3
","Aliens has been officially called one of the very few sequels to be deemed better than the original by critics. Sue me, but I liked the original Alien movie and Alien 3 a lot better.Don't get me wrong, I really liked Aliens, it's a good movie... but it somehow lacked the tense atmosphere and isolation of ALIEN and ALIEN 3. Aliens is The Terminator of the Alien franchise- directed by no one else but Terminator's own James Cameron - and it is definitely more action-oriented. That is not necessarily bad, and I can understand why some people might prefer this, I however didn't.Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) reprises her role with equal brilliance as in Alien, and there is no doubt, without her there wouldn't have been a Terminator 2's Sarah Connor and probably no Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Xena Warrior Princess. Ripley is a genuine action hero and a role model for female heroines.Apart from the stereotypical marines, performances are quite good, first and foremost Lance Henrickson and also Michael Biehn.The 1990 special edition (director's cut) offers more depth to the characters, but at a run time of almost 3 hours is a bit long, the theatrical version is paced just perfectly. The aliens are more numerous and serve as cannon fodder rather than posing a serious threat at times. Some of the prolonged action scenes in the DC are tedious and I can understand why they didn't make it into the theatrical cut. I prefer the isolation and near powerlessness of Alien and Alien 3 to the more action- and SFX- oriented Aliens.Aliens' outstanding visual and sound effects won Academy Awards. Unlike many other movies, these Oscars are well deserved. The aliens look outstanding and far better than some of today's CGI BS. Like Terminator 2, Aliens was a landmark for SFX.",5,5,12,29 September 2016
Get Out," FUEL FOR THE SJW HATE MACHINE...
","GET OUT is just that - fuel for the 'liberal' (nothing liberal about them really) SJW hate machine: all white people in this film are racist scum, all black people are good guys and victims. No good white people, no evil bad people.
Apart from this issue we are served a below average horror film that is not scary at all and was simply hyped for political reasons.
Avoid this. Except of course if you are a SJW in which case you probably already own this film and no doubt hate everyone who does not love this film.",1,29,48,23 January 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Should not be titled 'Mad Max'...
","... but rather 'Furiosa & Sidekick Max: Furyosa Road'.
This no longer is Mad Max. No Gibson. No Australia.
Instead you get Mad Maxine and Africa.
No impressed.",3,1,1,21 May 2020
