The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," It is what it is
","SPOILER ALERT!!! Books are meant to explain, images to illustrate. Each is understood in their own way, and often the two have only a moderate compatibility. Breaking Dawn Part 1 attempts to illustrate the book to us, and by the nature of illustration's limitations, much is changed, or just left out.We don't see Jacob trying to imprint on total strangers at a Seattle park. The conversations between Jacob and Leah (and other Leah actions) about her contempt for the Cullens is illustrated in a brief scene that also covers Esme's consideration of the wolves. In the book, Bella mentions that as she and Edward are driving away from the reception, she sees Renee with an arm around Phil, at the same time holding Charlie's hand. In the movie we see Renee singing to Bella, cut to the look of anguish and nostalgia on Charlie's face. Some things confused me, like the Charlie storyline.Some things are expected: Jacob shirtless; Alice in full-blown fashion frenzy mode; Carlisle's wisdom; Charlie's gruffness.Some things are needed: the occasional tweaking of a scene to add drama lest the movie become a snooze fest.Yes, Taylor Lautner's (Jacob) acting is uneven at times, Kristen Stewart (Bella) is as closed off as ever, and Robert Pattinson (Edward) is about as exciting as a bowl of pudding. But in the hands of director Bill Condon (Kinsey, Gods and Monsters), with supporting cast members like Billy Burke (Charlie), Ashley Greene (Alice), and Nikki Reed (Rosalie), and with writer Melissa Rosenberg obviously having a lot of respect for Stephenie Meyer's work, the movie coalesces into something worth watching.For me, the special effects were not overdone. I've read and heard complaints about the 'cheeziness' of the wolves; while I wish the CGI had been better, for those who complain I remind them of the original Star Wars movie.I appreciated Condon's subtlety, the best example being the bed-breaking scene (and the view of the bedroom the morning after). It was both funny and frightening, and had it been just mere mortals together, they probably would have just said 'Oops!' Charlie's interest in the graduation hats is not only a good lead-in to his wedding speech, but also possibly a portent.It is what it is. Each person must decide for themselves. I've decided I like it, and hopefully have adequately explained why. If you've read the book, approach the movie with an open mind. Even if you haven't read the book, watch the movie carefully. Better yet, watch it twice.",8,2,9,23 November 2011
