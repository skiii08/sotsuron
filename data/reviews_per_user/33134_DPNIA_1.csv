Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent
","I think that this movie was one of the best.  It had excellent graphics, a great story line, no sex or nudity, and no adult language.  It was the fourth greatest movie of all time behind the other three star wars movies. I will admit that some of the acting was not great.  It was fair.  It though still had some good supporting actors and was quite exciting.  I give this movie a huge 10 and suggest that everyone who has not seen it goes see it soon.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
