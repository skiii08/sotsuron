The King's Speech," A true person can makes you how potential you are & grow the self confident within you.. this is all about the movie
","The King's speech is simply a masterpiece. the storyline itself is simple, yet incredibly intriguing. the direction of the film is beautiful making it a sheer joy to watch. I was never once bored, in fact I was completely entertained every second of the film. But the real reason I watched this film was, not because of the story, but for the acting. It shouldn't come as a surprise, but Collin Firth is truly astonishing. His performance is more than Oscar worthy, and deserves to be always remembered. In fact, it was not acting. Collin Firth became the character of George VI. Also Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter both did a marvelous job in the film.",10,0,0,28 March 2011
Black Swan," Mind is very dangerous thing & hard to control
","The good is that Natalie Portman gives an Oscar worthy performance. The bad is that this movie is so intense it is frequently painful to watch. I've even heard some who think it should be classified as a horror movie.As independent film buffs, I see a lot of films that are not intended for a wide audience. Fortunately, many are excellent. Although this film was very well made and had excellent direction.The one high point of the movie was near the end when Natalie performs as the Black Swan. As is sometimes the case, movies that don't entertain get very high critical reviews. What is surprising to me is that user's gave this movie such a high score.",7,0,1,26 March 2011
The Prestige," if you believe in tricks ... you have to keep secrets..
","A great magician experience from Chistopher Nolan. It is a perfectly crafted mind game. Christian Bale was incredible and unforgettable as an overly eccentric magician(s). It was also one of the best performances from the Powerhouse known as Hugh Jackman . i just saw this movie last night and let me tell you, this movie had me guessing the whole time because usually you could predict the plot of the move but not this time,twist over twist over twist... this is one of the few movies ever made the keep on shocking you, also the ending is probably better than any movie from 2000-present and no lie. some people say that there is no hero but once you see this movie, you will understand because greed, pride and obsession are the key factors so if you miss the movies that have a bang for your buck, after all Jack & Bale effect..... can't leave..",8,0,2,1 April 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Old Adventures new way...
","I enjoyed every minute of The Adventures of Tin Tin. The story in not only fast moving, it's beautifully designed all the way through including the opening graphics. The carefully drawn Herge comic-strip style book has been translated into film perfectly. Tin Tin books, are not just fun to read, they are imaginatively adventurous and carefully designed and drawn. Translating all this so faithfully into CGi 3D and 2D film format is a brilliant achievement. I didn't want it to end. We watched it in 3D... I found myself smiling all the way through the film. Although it is an exciting adventure, it also has a really entertaining storyline. The pickpocket who catalogued and archived all the wallets he stole, Snowy's stunts when Tin Tin is kidnapped, the timing of the stunts, the bumbling Thomson twins and the brilliantly swashbuckling Captain Haddock. Probably, as with the books, this is a film I would want to watch again and again. The exciting and stylish world of Tin Tin offers such delightful escapism, I think I will want visit it again... Must watch movie I can say !! and finally great Direction by Steven Spielberg.",9,0,2,15 November 2011
WALL·E," a machine have a heart.......
","am always love animated movie. an intelligent robot goes about his business of cleaning the earth up after an apparently devastating war. at the core of Wall E is this sweet love story between two robots that captivates you right from the word go. Wall E's desperate attempts to impress Eve are hilarious enough. The climax is marked by a heart wrenching battle by Eva to save Wall E. the background score works wonders for the movie & beautifully captures the essence of the scenes. on the whole, its a film that would bring a big smile on your face. I am not sure if it stays with you for a long time but nevertheless a very enjoyable watch. I only wished that the finale was not of the sort '& they lived happily ever after.......",7,0,1,27 March 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," What a movie !! A little hope can push you forward ..
","Every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that it is my favorite movie of all time. But certainly as entertaining a film that it is, being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare I say—the greatest film ever made. But what then makes a film great? First and foremost, if it sets out to entertain the general public, it must do that (and Shawshank certainly does that). Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great 'greatest movie' debate. The serious nature of its central plot points—a wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escape—is contrasted by some truly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy, the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. There's nothing fancy about this film—no special effects, spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women. No, its just the telling of a story, mostly through the narration of Morgan Freeman's character, Red, that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here. But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like I'm actually sharing in Andy's redemption. Now if that isn't what they teach in Film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom. Ultimately, there cannot be a single motion picture that is the 'greatest film of all time' because as art, and in an art form as varied as cinema, greatness must be measured by each individual. Greatness, as beauty, truly is in the eye of the beholder. But in this beholder's eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen.",10,0,0,25 March 2011
50_50," nice movie
","'50/50', Inspired by a true story, is a comedy centered on a 27-year-old guy who learns of his cancer diagnosis, and his subsequent struggle to beat the disease. '50/50' has a good start, a mediocre middle & a feel-good end. The depiction of it's protagonist's battle with cancer, and his entire journey, comes out well. Reiser's Screenplay is engaging. Jonathan Levine Directs this story well. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable. Music is excellent. Performance-Wise: Joseph Gordon-Levitt excels in the lead role. Seth Rogen is routine. Anna Kendrick is emerging into a very, very fine performer. She delivers a fantastic performance. Bryce Dallas Howard is very convincing. On the whole, '50/50' is a genuinely good effort. i like it :)",7,1,1,29 March 2012
The Fighter," Those who believe in skill they can draw the line on their own..
","I love this movie, It is one of the best movies of the Year, Its real people, real life and real family. is an outstanding film that features outstanding performances from Melissa Leo, Christian Bale and Amy Adams. It's a little predictable but it's a solid, on-your-feet, emotionally arresting, entertaining boxing drama.Finally, This movie will have multiple nominations when Oscar time rolls around. The city of Lowell paints a good background for this picture. Not since Raging Bull have I been so into a boxing movie. Bale is always top notch and Wahlburg keeps showing his acting teeth. With the action not to over done and the meat & potatoes of training for the Big fight you will want to cheer for the underdog.",8,0,2,23 March 2011
