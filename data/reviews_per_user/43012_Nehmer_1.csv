The Blair Witch Project," Do not believe the hype
","As proof that no-budget films can still lure large audiences, 'The Blair Witch Project' is an inspirational story. Fueled by a shrewd marketing campaign, the aura surrounding this indi has sent scores of film patrons, including myself, to the back of long lines. After two misfires with sold out shows, I finally landed a ticket and settled into my seat almost intimidated with wonder over what I was about to see. Eighty-two minutes later, I was bursting with more questions than ever. Questions such as, `Am I the only one, or is this movie a major let down?' `Was I the only one not to be the slightest bit scared?' `What movie did I just see, because I've already forgotten about it?'But don't get me wrong, `Blair Witch' did have a number of strong points. For one, it offers an original and clever ghost story, with the filmmakers capturing among the most genuine emotions I've ever seen in characters. Elements such as fear, confusion, hunger and frustration were portrayed with unrivaled authenticity. However, while the trio on screen might have been scared, never at one point of the movie was I even the slightest bit frightened. Not the slightest bit. I kept waiting to be terrified and it never happened. I guess I don't have issues with the filmmakers as much as the hype and reviews surrounding the movie. I cannot recall how many reviews I've read featuring bold statements such as 'one of the scariest movies ever made.' I mean come on, the trailer for 'Baby Geniuses' was scarier than Blair Witch. While I recommend it for hardcore indi fans with an interest in unconventional filmmaking, as a heavyweight horror film belonging in the same league as `The Exorcist,' `Halloween,' and `Night of the Living Dead,' do not believe the hype.",5,0,2,31 July 1999
