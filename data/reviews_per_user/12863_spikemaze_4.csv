The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Nothing so bad and still funny since Ed Wood
","Why did I even watch this movie? I read a mock cartoon about the Twilight saga on 9gag and this morning my newborn son was sleeping on me and I was really bored. Maybe it was the lack of sleep.I don't know how to describe how horribly but funny this movie is. It's nothing like Ed Wood, but has the same way of enchanting the viewer by how terribly it is.The movie starts out with the werewolf getting mad and Bella's dad worries because Bella Swan is getting married. And despite a lot of horrible nightmares about the wedding, she goes through with it. It's as if she takes every good advice from her father and friends and does the complete opposite. Which of course tuns out badly for her. The movie is filled with stone-faced acting, overly dramatic music and voiced-over wolf talk. Even the makeup is bad. But the absolute worst is the simple and ridiculous story by Stephanie Meyer which proves that books can be a waste of paper.So why watch this movie? Well, if you're bored and want a laugh about the stupidity of those people who like these films, I think this is the perfect movie for you. Just don't spend any money on it.",4,5,6,25 November 2012
The Dark Knight," Very good, but no masterpiece
","I admit it: After seeing the ratings( that I usually trust) on this site, I went to see The Dark Knight with great expectation. I also admit that Batman Begins quite disappointed me because it was so different from the comics I grew up with. But I was ready to watch The Dark Knight with respect for the new Batman.I found The Dark Knight to be a wonderful film, but not a masterpiece. I expected it to open my eyes like The Shawshank Redemption or Memento - creative movies you can't forget because they have touched something you and surprised you. I was surprised by The Dark Knight, but it didn't touch me. For me it was an action movie with dark psychological elements and wonderful, complex characters. Though without anything extraordinary about it.Actually only a few things actually bothered me about the movie: 1. The many story lines which made me think that the Joker isn't the main storyline - perhaps there even isn't one. 2. How most of the film only contained a Joker who laughed at Batman's rescue attempts - not the Joker whose mind we really get to enter. 3. 3. Batman's voice when in costume. 4. How Scarecrow was suddenly made a small criminal. 5. How Lucius Fox suddenly was a new Q (from Bond, not Star Trek) and even Bruce Wayne acted like the clumsy agent who had a hard time with his new toys (technological objects). 6. How Two-Face was killed so quickly.These things I can overlooked because of the wonderful acting and the amazing plot and direction. But that is not enough to create a masterpiece.The IMDb's top 250 has been my guiding list for classic movies. I have become a movie freak, mostly thanks to this site. I trust the ratings in here. Therefore I expected to see a masterpiece. And this wasn't one. Not like Dr. Strangelove or Leon. Not even close to A Clockwork Orange or Amadeus. So tell me this: why has The Dark Knight received such respect from some of the best movie critics in the world who have gathered here on this site? I read your comments, but I still haven't gotten an answer to what makes this a masterpiece.I suggest people to watch the film and decide for themselves. Just think: In what way will this movie make you reflect over your own life and is it enough to be #1?",6,2,6,26 July 2008
Alice in Wonderland," OK if you don't have any expectations
","After having read a bunch of reviews before watching Alice in Wonderland, I'd lost most of all my expectations to the film. I only expected to see some pretty 3D... (as it was my first film in 3D)The 3D really sucked. It's fine in the beginning, but after a while it's just annoying.The movie on the other hand was not horrible. It wasn't a real Tim Burton movie - only the character Hamish reminded me of something Tim Burton would put in a movie. But having said that, it wasn't a bad movie. Yes, it was quite boring and though it contained a lot of the great actors, who normally shine through every film, it was clear all the way through that the whole thing was filmed in front of a green screen. They lacked connection, not only to their surroundings, but also to their fellow actors. It was clearly too difficult for the actors and they probably did the best they could. Johnny Depp didn't seem at all like Willy Wonka or Jack Sparrow to me(okay, perhaps the latter once or twice), but he didn't become the role as you normally see with him. Maybe because he didn't know who Hatter really was. This was a confusing character. He didn't seem directly Mad, just like he had a bit too many personalities (one of them reminding of Jack Sparrow). The other actors did OK too with the character and script they had been given. There was some overacting here and there, but all in all they could have done much worse. The main reason why some people (also me actually) is disappointed with the acting is that we naturally expect so much more from such great actors.What saved the movie for me was the talking animals - though I normally loathe these things in movies. The voice acting over-shone the 'real life' acting, especially Stephen Fry was wonderful. And the animals made the movie fun too.I think that if Tim Burton had made this film as in the old days with real surroundings and not too many animations (a la Beetlejuice), the movie could've been great. The actors would have been able to act with their surroundings and communicate with each other which probably would improve their acting a great deal - 'cause we know they can act. Or else Burton should have made it as a real animation film.I missed the Tim Burton heart of the film. The problem is that when you go to see a Tim Burton film, you're not gonna be satisfied with a 'normal' film. And that is what Alice in Wonderland is: A 'normal' film with way too many special effects.",3,2,5,19 March 2010
Fifty Shades of Grey," People hate it because of the hype
","This movie is really not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Many voters haven't even seen it and others have hated it before they saw it.I was so focused on the book the first time I saw it that I didn't really appreciate the movie for what it was. Then a friend dragged me in for a second viewing and I knew what to expect. I was very surprised because it wasn't as bad as I thought the first time.No, it is not a masterpiece. And it's missing many scenes from the book - a book that was terribly written and originally was a Twilight fanfic (which still pains me),but had a good story. This is the story, they should focus on.The sex scenes were not necessary to that extent and they should have cut it short. Dakota Johnson was not my favorite choice for Ana Steele. She's not tiny enough. But I found her actually very fun and quite good. Jamie Dornan was a good Christian for me, though many do not agree. A few times his accent slipped, but other than that he did a very good job. Sadly the script didn't give Jamie and Dakota much room to explore their roles. It was too shallow so I applaud them for doing it so well.But a few casting choices were not so good. Elliot was not a sweet, hot lady killer, but looked more like a creepy drug dealer. Kate was not gorgeous enough and Grace (Christians mom) was too young.All the criticism for being anti feminism is something I don't understand. We start out with seeing a girl who doesn't have any self-esteem and lets everyone walk all over her. Then she meets a man who gives her confidence to stand up for herself. She finds her own inner strength. Also, there's no rape between Ana and Christian, not in the movie nor the book.Many from the BDSM community complains that the book makes it seem that you can only be into BDSM if you have psychological problems. It isn't true. Ana discovers that she likes it too and that 'it isn't the how that was wrong. It was the why'. There's nothing wrong with liking BDSM, but it is wrong if you do it to punish and work out your personal problems. I think it's sad that the movie has such a bad rating on IMDb because it's not terrible. Many horrible movies have better ratings so it's obviously because of the hype that many don't like the movie (or the books for that matter).Go watch the movie without expectations. You'd be surprised.",10,15,21,3 March 2015
