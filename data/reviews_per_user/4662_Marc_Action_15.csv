Men in Black 3," A Step Above Mediocre
","So the men in black are back and as vigilant as ever in their quest to maintain order among Earth's secret population of extraterrestrial beings. Only this time we're going back to 1969 to stop our villain Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement) from killing Agent K in the past and from destroying Earth in the present.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones fill their usual roles as Agent J and Agent K, respectively. However, this film sees the addition of Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men, W., Milk, etc.) as the younger Agent K in 1969. Brolin is brilliant in his role as the younger Agent K, and he picks up Tommy Lee Jones' characteristics very well, almost making it look too easy. However, for some reason I just felt like with Tommy Lee being an official senior citizen these days, his character should have looked considerably younger than what Brolin was able to portray for the 1969 scenes. Based on Tommy Lee's age, if I do my math right, that means Agent K would have been around 23 years old in 1969. Brolin at 44 years old, is much too old to play Agent K in 1969. That's a huge age difference that can't be overlooked. Otherwise, Brolin did an excellent job.As usual in this franchise, the aliens are overly exaggerated and the special effects are comical, but the plot is decent enough and Smith and Brolin have great chemistry. There's also a touching plot twist near the end, if not highly unlikely.I hear there is another sequel in the works. If so, I think Brolin should take over for Tommy Lee Jones... Maybe taking place sometime in the late '80s or early '90s, a time period more age-appropriate for Brolin as Agent K. He looks great in this role and maybe it's time for a fresh start. Hey, we could even get Jaden to take over for Will... Well, maybe not.Anyway, I'm not a big fan of the franchise but I did like this installment. It's worth a look.",6,0,1,29 December 2012
Star Trek," Good But Certainly Not Great
","OK, so this is like the 10th million film or series to feature the Star Trek name since William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy defined the franchise in the original series back in the 60's. Well, even though I'm exaggerating that number, there really has been an overkill of Star Trek material since The Motion Picture in 1979. So what does this new somewhat prequel/somewhat reboot bring to the table that makes it worthy of the Star Trek name? I'm sorry to say, I'm not really sure.There are some things to like about the film. The special effects for one. And the slick realistic Enterprise props, for two. After that, it's not so easy to find things you love or things you really hate about this film. The plot could get a little confusing if you saw this at the theater due to the time travel elements, but since I saw this at home on DVD I was able to rewind and do a double take when things got a little confusing. Once you make sense of everything the whole time travel element actually makes the film much more interesting. Still, as with other films featuring time travel, things do start to get a little bit 'illogical', if I can quote Spock.Speaking of Spock, Leonard Nimoy is the only original cast member to make an appearance on this film as Spock 'from the future', and I must tell you, he is a welcome addition. I also liked Zachary Quinto's performance as 'present day' Spock. Maybe having the 'original' Spock on the set was an advantage that Zachary had over the other actors. While Chris Pine did nail some of Shatner's mannerisms as Kirk, I just didn't feel like he was convincing enough in the role, and that goes for rest of the leading cast members. It's not that I expected them to be carbon copies of the original cast members, but I did expect them to be believable in their roles; however, most of the performances were just mediocre, forgettable - and that's the biggest problem with this movie. I get that it's a modern film, so it's never going to have the feel of the original series with its cardboard-like props or even the first set of movies that revived the franchise three decades ago. But good acting transcends time and this cast just wasn't compelling. Even the villain, Romulan Captain Nero played by Eric Bana, was tired and boring. It's actors like Ricardo Montalb√°n who played the villain Khan in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) that made that movie the hit that it was back then and classic that it is today. We'll have none of that this time, folks! Not even Nimoy's few scenes could save this film from mediocrity. And apparently we missed the whole part where Spock and Uhura had an affair on the original series and movies. Well they have one on this film, and truly, they could have left it out. Not that I'm opposed to them rewriting the book to make this film different, but if you're going to do it. Do it right. There is absolutely 'zero' chemistry between Quinto and Zoe Saldana (as Uhura).The film's other issues are the mediocre dialogue and the worn out plot elements that we've seen time and time again. Ex. - Is there ever going to be another modern action or sci-fi movie in which one of the main characters (in this case two of the main characters) aren't trying to avenge the death/murder of a loved one? Or did you really think this sci-fi (or alien) movie wasn't going to involve a plot to destroy the Earth by the villain? And did you actually think the main character (protagonist/hero) wouldn't save the day (and the Earth)? In a nutshell, the movie wasn't horrible, but after seeing it, I can guarantee you'll forget much of what you saw in the 'not too distant future'. And I don't have to be a time traveler to know that.",6,0,1,13 July 2012
This Is the End," XXX crap posing as a comedy film
","OK, so an ensemble cast of talented actors play themselves in an apocalyptic comedy. Sounds original and intriguing. So what happened with This Is The End? Why wasn't it good? Even more disturbing is why has it received almost universal praise from critics and fans? The film definitely has it's funny moments early on; however, it begins to drag near the middle and the tired attempts at humor onward to the end come off as downright desperate. It's painful. The loose script that allowed the actors to kind of do their own thing really begins to show just how difficult this can be for even seasoned actors. I'd like to think I'm no square with a decent sense of humor (I was the class clown in high school after all) but was it really necessary for the comedy to turn so vulgar? ***SPOILER ALERT*** Some parts were borderline criminal, like when Jay Baruchel starts talking about which of the men might rape Emma Watson. Then there's the parts that are too XXX, like when Danny McBride spends entirely too much time talking about masturbating all over James Franco's crib or the scene where a giant devil walks through Los Angeles with his manhood swinging freely for all to see. ***END SPOILER***I actually can't believe James Franco agreed to do this garbage. It's like a couple of steps backward for him. He's shown himself to be a pretty good actor with performances in films like 127 Hours, Oz The Great and Powerful, Milk, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Now he goes and does this and all of a sudden it's like Wayne's World 2013. The concept of celebrities playing themselves in a disaster/comedy gets high marks but the horrible script, special effects, and surprisingly bad acting (even for a comedy) sinks This is the End. Don't get sucked into the Matrix. It's OK to take the red pill. This is not a good movie.",3,4,9,7 July 2014
127 Hours," 127 Hours Wasn't Long Enough
","Brilliant!!!! I'm a fan of James Franco so maybe I could be a little biased but he made this movie. I really believed he was down there trapped in that canyon just like the original Aron Ralston. I also felt like I was right there rooting for him to make it out; right there feeling his pain as that last drop of water dried up and he had to resort to drastic measures; right there during those vivid hallucinations; right there when he made that 'good bye' video to his family thinking 'this is it!'.Director Danny Boyle did a great job adapting Ralston's near death experience to the big screen; the movie itself based on the New York Times bestseller autobiography, Between a Rock and a Hard Place. Considering a great deal of this movie features only one character, Boyle (along with Simon Beaufoy) worked wonders with the screenplay. As you can imagine, special effects were almost non-existent. I think the only time we saw special effects were during Ralston's brief hallucination spells. The lack of special effects made the film all the more real, and realness is something seriously missing from modern films. Make-up also was on point as at times during the ordeal Franco (as Ralston) looked like the walking dead.There are other actors, and a touching cameo of Ralston and his family at the end, but this movie is all Franco.If you are a fan of survival movies, then you have to see this.",9,0,1,13 July 2012
Underworld Awakening," Unnecessary
","As a devote fan of the original Underworld, I've seen every sequel/prequel with hope that the franchise will live up to the original. NO SUCH LUCK! Seems every new installment gets even more unbearable than the last one.Underwold: Awakening is no exception. And quite frankly, was very unnecessary. The Michael Corvin sub-plot has become weak and useless, and the fact that the little girl so vigorously hunted down by the government and lycans would turn out to be Selene and Micheal's daughter was no surprise. But what's more disturbing about this sub-plot is that it was confusing and went no place, and the chemistry between mother and daughter was absolutely non-existent.Also, the 'we have superhuman powers beyond imagination, yet we are letting puny humans hunt us, quarantine us, and exterminate us' is a ridiculous plot that has been done before - for reference, see X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and the TV series, Heroes (NBC).My hopes aren't too high for this franchise anymore, so please stop making trashy, unnecessary sequels. I do not recommend this film. Do yourself a favor and go buy the original, watch it over and over again and you'll still love it much more the 25th time as you did watching this crap the first time...",4,2,4,29 May 2012
Bird Box," Not Understanding All The Hype
","The movie was OK. Definitely better than the Happening, and that's not saying much, but the Bird Box certainly did not live up to the hype.In a post-apocalyptic world where a supernatural entity is making people kill themselves once they see 'it', Sandra Bullock's character must make it through the forest to a safe haven with two young children in tow, all while blindfolded - so she won't see 'it'. That's the premise and it's not too plausible. Walking through a dense forest blindfolded? Yeah, right. Hell, some people wouldn't be able to halfway walk through the woods without tripping over a log with full sight, yet we're expected to believe she can navigate blindfolded just fine with two children in tow?Anyway, we do get to see how Bullock's character got to this point via flashbacks, and quite frankly, those are the better parts of this movie. I think the best scene in Bird Box was when the initial survivors at the house in the city ran out of food and had to make a trip to the grocery store. Without giving away any details, this sequence is one of the few bright spots in terms of originality that you will see in this film.Besides that, we just see survivors surviving and then getting killed off and not much else. If you're looking for: who, what, why, or how? Good luck, you won't find 'it' here. Otherwise, decent cinematography and acting by Sandra Bullock, John Malkovich, Trevante Rhodes, and the little girl are the only things holding this movie together. It's worth a look. 5 stars.",5,625,865,28 December 2018
Man of Steel," Nolan Does It Again!
","So the man that brought you The Dark Knight brings you The Man of Steel. Christopher Nolan produces and co-writes this reboot (actually a prequel) of the Superman franchise. And while Zack Snyder is the director, it should be no surprise that Nolan's writing on one of the most famous comic characters comes with a darker and more serious tone than previous Superman material. But is it any good? Well, let's just say the 8 stars that appear above the summary should be a clue: It's really really good! ***SPOILER ALERT **** At first I was rather displeased at the fact that the plot doesn't stay true to Superman comics; it blazes an entirely different path, and the storyline at first seemed too hard to follow, but it all comes together quite nicely by the end of the film. Although there are a few plot missteps that just don't make sense, like for example Superman doesn't assume his disguise/alter-persona of Clark Kent or start working at the Daily Planet until the end of the film, well after Lois Lane, Perry White and the whole wide world already knows he's Superman - an obvious head scratcher. Hey, Nolan and David Goyer, if you guys are going to change major plot elements to make your storyline work, then have the balls to go all the way. I understand you guys want to build in a connection to the original story, but why add the Clark Kent secret identity and him working at the Daily Planet piece to the end of the film if it makes absolutely no sense in relation to what just transpired in the previous 142 minutes of your film?OK, that's it for the spoilers, back to the basics. Overall, I loved the dialogue. It was great without being too preachy or overly analytical as The Dark Knight films. And of course with an all-star supporting cast like Russell Crow (Jor-El), Kevin Costner (Jonathan Kent), and Diane Lane (Martha Kent), you know you're in stored for some quality acting. As for Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent ‚Äì it was good enough (he certainly does look the part) but he's no Christopher Reeves. Amy Adams plays Lois Lane. I think her and Cavill delivered great chemistry but she was really forgettable as Lois. Michael Shannon, on the other hand, did an excellent job as General Zod. I think he brought great depth to a villain who honestly thought he was doing the right thing. Another surprisingly great performance was put on by German actress Antje Traue as Faora, Zod's ruthless female military subordinate. She really kicks butt in this film and looks every bit as mean as Zod does. Changing major plot elements of Superman's story was a risky move but I think it paid off. I don't have a problem with this, so long as it's done right - and aside from the weak attempt to connect back to the original Superman story at the end, the changes work. There's only one other thing I had a problem with in the movie - the editing and camera work in the opening scenes on Krypton were a mess. The action and fight sequences were filmed too close up and were fast moving. Plus the entire first 5 minutes or so seemed a bit out of focus to me. This was a major issue that prevented me from rating this with a perfect 10 or a 9. Regardless, it was a great superhero flick that I had high expectations for. It delivered! Put this on your list as a 'must see' for the summer. It's light years better than 2006's Superman Returns.",8,0,0,14 June 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Classic Action/Sci-Fi
","I saw this the other day on cable for like the millionth time. That's when you know a movie is great - if you can watch it again and again over the years and it's still just as exciting each time as it was the first time. It's hard to believe this movie is now 20 years old, but its special effects and use of CGI actually hold up better than most of the over-budget garbage that passes for action/sci-fi these days.In the original Terminator (1984) Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) kills off the cyborg-assassin (Arnold Schwarzenegger) sent from the year 2029 to take her out. Of course, she had the help of the young, handsome Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to help her. He was sent back from the same year by Sarah's future son, John Connor. In the future, John is apparently the leader of a human resistance movement gaining momentum against the machines, who have taken over Earth and unleashed apocalyptic hell on mankind. The machines' system (dubbed Skynet) thought it could send the terminator back in time to kill off Sarah, which would erase John from existence, and thus would wipe out the resistance. It fails to do that, and with that, makes room for a sequel.Now, if you can get past the whole butterfly effect and the grandfather paradox that makes a lot of what happens in this franchise highly unlikely, then you'll be able to appreciate just how great the first two movies were. T2 for its part, is even better than the original. It picks up 11 years after the events of the first movie, to 1995 (interesting that T2 is set a few years in the future from its release year 1991, while the original was set in then-present day 1984).This time around the sweet, innocent Sarah Connor is replaced by a much more militant, yet psychologically-disturbed female warrior. John Connor is a rebellious teen that still doesn't realize the gravity of his future, and Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator. Only this time, he's been programmed by the Resistance to protect John. Why? Because Skynet is sending a more advanced Terminator to kill Connor as a teen. Robert Patrick does an excellent job as the new T-1000, ice cold one moment, then able to speak like a charismatic human when it suits its purpose, something the old Terminator cannot do. The T-1000 also can shape-shift into various stabbing weapons and other people.It's great to see Arnie back but fighting on the good side. He's not the best actor in the world, or even a close second, but this genre suits him. And when he has great material to work with, he will shine. Hamilton also gives an excellent performance here. There are very few females that can pull off the action heroine role and be 110% convincing. Like Sigourney Weaver in Aliens, I wouldn't want to run into Sarah in a dark alley.As great as the film is, it is not without its faults. As I've said earlier, based on our current knowledge of the laws of physics, time travel to the past to kill someone presents a number of problems, and none of those issues were properly addressed by the franchise. But then it is sci-fi, so pretty much anything can be forgiven in this genre. Also, I think the factory scene at the end of T2 was too convenient and way too reminiscent of the original movie. A little bit more originality for the ending please! Otherwise a great movie and a collector's item.",9,1,1,29 January 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Reboot is 'Amazing'
","I was never a fan of the Spider-Man Trilogy that debuted 10 years ago starring Toby McGuire, Kirsten Dunst, Norman Osborn, and James Franco. So when I learned a quick reboot was coming down the pipes I was somewhat on the fence about it. On one hand, I was eager to see if director Marc Webb could pull it off any better. On the other hand, I wasn't optimistic that any reboot this soon (and with some of the same production team members) would be able to let go of the roots planted by Sam Raimi's movies. I'm glad to say that I was wrong. I liked The Amazing Spider-Man. Was it a slam-dunk? No, but it succeeded in my book in besting the previous Spider-Man movies and blazing its own path. This movie succeeds because Raimi kept things simple. He didn't try to 'out do' the previous trilogy and he had a solid cast in place along with nice special effects. So, in the theme of this film, I'm going to keep this review simple. Here's what worked: 1. The Cast - Who could ask for a better cast? Andrew Garfield looks much more at home in the role as Spidey than Maguire did. But like Maguire, Spider-Man is sure to make him a household name. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy does a great job. She has a much greater 'on-screen' presence than Dunst did as Mary Jane Watson, and she's prettier too! The chemistry between the two young stars is so hot and natural. I wouldn't be surprised if these two started dating in real life. And what can I say, both Martin Sheen and Sally Fields were great in this movie as the Parkers, but Sheen stole the show as Uncle Ben. Denis Leary gave a solid perform as Captain George Stacy of the NYPD and Gwen's father, and Rhys Ifan's performance as Dr. Curt Connors aka The Lizard was quite chilling. 2. Special effects (minus 3D) - Overall, the special effects were very good, and the Lizard villain, although obviously CG, still looked life-like and was not overly done. (He had a grin so very reminiscent of Heather Leadger's Joker in The Dark Knight (2008). Was it a rip-off? Nope, I actually like it.) 3. Simple, simple, simple. As I said before, the director kept it simple with this film. The main characters are all well-rounded and likable - even the Dr. Curt Connors, and nothing here is overly done. Note - the train ride home after Peter gains his powers is classic!!! Here's what didn't work: 1. 3D Application - Overall I liked the special effects but really, the application of 3D in this film was seriously lacking. They could have shot this film conventionally and it wouldn't have made much difference. I saw more 3D effects in the 60-second previews that preceded the movie than I did in the actual movie. 2. Storyline/Plot - It's great that they changed up a lot of elements to 'try' to make this movie stand apart from its predecessors, but there were a few things that were problematic for me and the plot was still anything but fresh. First off, the previews and the intro make it seem as if the movie will go deep into Peter's background and what happened to his parents. Well, it disappointed on that part. While I do like that things were simple, I think maybe his parent's story/sub-plot was a little too simple. In my opinion, their story only serves as a vehicle to set up Peter's spider bite. After that, they don't talk much about his folks, and we don't ever get resolution to what happened to them. What we did learn up to that point where Peter was bitten was just not very compelling. I guess they are saving something for the sequels to come, maybe? Secondly, the villain and chief antagonist in this film, the Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors, reminds me too much of Dr. Otto Octavius aka Doc Ock from Spider-Man 2 (2004) with their Jackal & Hyde personalities and strikingly similar, twisted agendas. The Lizard's agenda also cuts too close to Magneto's agenda in the first X-Men film (2000). Plus what happens to Dr. Rajit Ratha, Dr. Connors evil boss? He clearly had malevolent intentions with Dr. Connors new drug but after being saved by Spidey from an attack by the Lizard, he is never seen in the film again. I also can't believe filmmakers are still using the 'high school bully gets his butt kicked by super hero that used to be a dork' sub-plot (although one of the handsomest dorks I've ever seen). It's way past old and makes you think these people don't have a creative bone left in their bodies.Go see the movie, despite a stale plot with holes bigger than a basketball, the charm of the characters and decent special effects make up for it. Just don't get too excited about it being in 3D, you'll hardly notice.",7,2,5,11 July 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Not a classic, but still a great movie
","I think one of the reasons why the original Planet of the Apes in 1968 was so good was because back then, special effects were so non-existent that films had to rely more on plot, deep character development, and the skill of great actors like Charlton Heston. With that said, I liked the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, because (while it's no classic like the original film) it manages to capture some of the old school formula that made the original so great.I'll admit that this film is rather too slow for my tastes, but it's slow because it needs to be. Trust me, there's nothing more powerful and moving than when you first hear a chimpanzee talk, screaming 'NOOOOOOOO' to the top of his lungs at a surprised handler at an ape facility. It comes late in the movie, but man, it's worth the long build up. You see, while James Franco gets top billing for this film, no human is the main character as in the original Planet of the Apes or its remake in 2001 starring Mark Wahlberg. The star here is Caesar (Andy Serkis), a baby chimp taken in by a young scientist by the name of Will Rodman (Franco) doing research for a cure of Alzheimer's disease. Caesar's mother is killed after an experiment goes awry, where she's injected with a substance that increases intelligence. You might have guested it, the substance is passed along to Caesar and he soon develops more and more human-like characteristics. It also helps that Caesar is raised in Will's home, which Will shares with his parents. As with the original movie, there is plenty of character development here and we actually care about Caesar and his fate, not to mention we develop a soft spot for the bond that the chimp shares with Will's father (John Lithgow), who if you haven't also guessed it, is suffering from Alzheimer's.The only downsides to this movie are that the various primates in the movie look decidedly digital. I prefer the actual primate costumes that were used in the previous Planet of the Apes movies. The ending was rather abrupt, and only seemed to serve as nothing more than a set up for a sequel. Also, Franco's role towards the end was pretty much useless. They could just have easily written him off the last 20 minutes and been just fine. What a waste of a talented actor.",7,1,2,25 January 2012
Insidious," Surprisingly Really Good
","This film was much better than I expected. These days it's really hard to make something original and actually scary. Too many horror movies(or movies in general) copy heavily from previous movies and rely too much on special effects to carry the movie. Insidious is the exact opposite.Insidious relies on a really good storyline, old school scare tactics, and a great set of cast members to carry the movie. Basically, the story revolves around a young couple and their 3 children that move into a new house only to start seeing strange, paranormal things going on. One of their sons, Dalton (Ty Simpkins) falls into a deep comma for no apparent reason and doctors can't explain why. Dalton is eventually moved back home still in the comma but paranormal incidents still continue to occur, but at an increasing, dangerous pace. Dalton's mother Renai (Rose Byrne) senses the evil presence in the house more than anyone else. She then convinces her husband, Josh (Patrick Wilson) to move out.But the strange paranormal activity only follows the family to their new home. The couple then enlists the help of Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye), a modern day ghost-buster of sorts, to help them rid the house of the paranormal activity. Along the way though we witness a couple of plot twists that are for the most part nicely done and effective.Let me just say, Lin Shaye is not a well-known actress but she shines as Elise Rainier and helps set the pace for the climax of the film.In today's terms, the movie had a really, really meager budget - a paltry $1.5 million. So, it's no wonder there's a big lack of special effects that most modern horror films rely on. But don't be too disappointed. This is one scary movie (think Poltergeist). Director James Won does a terrific job of creating fear with some really creepy moments throughout the movie. A malevolent voice shouting from your baby's monitoring system, only to see no one there when you get to the room; a shadowy dark figure with claw-like hands standing in the corner of your son's dark quiet room; or how about an evil entity cursing your very existence while your assistance scribbles down his every word in a wild, possessed-like manner. Scary stuff.The only draw back to the film is once the action speeds up and the plot twists start coming into play, it sometimes comes off as 'far-fetched' and some elements toward the end are unnecessary. However, overall the movie is great and the ending is to die for, literally.Check this movie out, it's a must see!",8,0,0,29 May 2012
Thor," Impressed
","There have been so many superhero flixs churned out of the Hollywood factory this past decade. So much so that it has made my head spin.I have high expectations when it comes to superhero movies. While they rely heavily on special effects, I also expect a great storyline and a believability factor to go along with it as well. With that said, few superhero films over the past decade have lived up to my expectations. While most films have nailed the special effects criteria, they just can't seem to get the plot thing down so well. The Dark Knight was by far the best of the bunch and I did enjoy the X-Men trilogy, but felt the Wolverine spin-off fell short. Unlike most other people I didn't really care for the highly successful Iron Man and Spider Man franchises. They made Robert Downey , Jr's character Tony Stark in Iron Man overly comical and Spider Man was too slow throughout the series. Both Hulk movies, Batman Returns, Superman Returns, Electra, Daredevil, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Fantastic Four were all major disappointments. I could add more recent superhero films to the list, but you get the point. It shouldn't be a surprise to tell you that, as with other superhero movies to grace the big screen this past year (Captain America, Green Lantern, The Green Hornet), I had no interest whatsoever in seeing Thor. The only reason I did see it was because my best friend rented it and pretty much forced me to watch it. I'm glad he did.This was a surprisingly entertaining movie with some interesting plot twists. The war scene that kicks off the movie is a little too dark so it's hard to make out what's going on, but that soon changes once we get into the meat of the storyline.What can you say about Anthony Hopkins? He's a great actor and gives nothing less than a great performance here as Odin, king and God of Asgard. He's also the father of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), although we learn things are not as they originally appear with this family.The best part about this movie is it has a believability factor to it. The characters are well developed and the overall plot works well. I would have given this film a higher rating but there were a few elements to the story that were confusing or just stupid. The fact that we didn't see Hemsworth shirtless more throughout the film is one of them. With a body like that you don't need dialogue!",7,0,0,2 February 2012
Arrival," Seriously, What Drugs Were The Writers On When They Wrote This?
","What in God's name did I just watch? This movie makes absolutely no sense. So a dozen alien spaceships show up shaped like black bars of Dove soap and the military gets college professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to translate for them? OK, so Louise spends months cracking the code of our ink-squirting aliens who resemble a cross between squids and Thing from the Addam's Family. Really? Only for a group of rogue soldiers to try and blow up the ship our protagonist is working out of and our resident aliens live in. But don't worry, our highly-advanced tentacled guests are much more forgiving than we are. Turns out, the aliens have a gift for us and actually still want us to have it even after that little stunt by a bunch of army privates. That gift turns out to be their highly-advanced language: Etch A Sketch. No kidding! What's even better is their version of Etch A Sketch can tell the future! So, now our alien flick turns into Looper? *Insert Captain Jean-Luc Picard Meme Here*Are you confused yet? Anyway, trying to explain the plot and the twist from this point forward gets even harder to do, so I won't. Let's just say it doesn't help that our characters are so wooden and mostly useless. Poor Forest Whitaker and Jeremy Renner. Both try their best, but Whitaker pulls off a no nonsense colonel better than Renner does a physicist. But that's not entirely Renner's fault. They pretty much gave him nothing to do other than be a glorified translation assistant and eventual love interest of Amy Adams. Then there is the screenplay and dialogue. Dreadful! Renner's character actually named our two main aliens Abott and Castillo. What's worse is the aliens actually answered to it!!!! *Insert More Captain Jean-Luc Picard Memes Here*",1,7,12,20 January 2019
Prometheus," Alien I
","The premise of the film is great. In the distant future a space crew is sent on a journey to possibly find the origin (or creators) of mankind. They use a star map discovered in a cave in Scotland by archaeologists. The team finally arrives at their destination four years later; a distant moon called LV233, only to learn that most of the aliens (which they dub as the 'Engineers') have long vacated the world or died out, and that something went terribly wrong some time ago. Before they can figure out just what that is that went wrong, things start going bad for the crew as well. This is all great stuff, and watching the storyline unfold is a thrill.Where Prometheus falls short is it tries to be the prequel to the cult hit film Alien from 1979 but doesn't quite mix with the chemistry of the original or the franchise that it kicked off. What's worst is Prometheus lifts elements directly from the franchise without bothering to change anything. For example, I get that including a mysterious android in the film ties it in with the franchise, but we already seen an android decapitated and impaled in Alien and Aliens, respectively. So doing it again here doesn't add any shock value for the audience. We've seen it before, try something new. Or how about the alien pregnancy, with the baby bursting from the abdomen? Yup, that was done already in Alien and Aliens 3. Well, actually there is a really cool surgical procedure in this film done to remove an alien baby from the main character's abdomen before it can hatch, so I guess they did change it up a little bit, but it's not enough to make anyone who's seen the Alien films care. Also while the premise is great, Ridley Scott's execution of the film is not. There is just too many implausible things going on in this film. A big issue is the opening scene. It is never really explained further in the film, and therefore, seems meaningless. The ending is also problematic. How can the lone survivor run off in an alien spaceship that she does not know how to operate in search of the 'Engineers' home planet without any food? Exactly how far does this character expect to get? It just doesn't make sense. There are a lot of moments like this in this film.",3,2,4,20 October 2012

","For a film with multiple directors and 6 different story-lines (and even several different genres within a single movie), it wasn't quite the train wreck that I expected. The excellent cinematography and the ensemble cast were its saving points, and I must admit that the premise of such a film in itself is unique. And while I did enjoy seeing the actors play varying roles in different time-lines, I'm on the fence as to the effectiveness of the make-up and costumes. Some were very good (Hugo Weaving as the demonic Old Georgie) and on the other hand, very cheap and cartoonish (Donna Bae, an Asian actress, as the 19th century Caucasian female, Tilda Ewing). Not that I have an issue with an actor of one race playing the role of a character from another race. It's acting, so I applaud it. However, if the director is going to take this approach, then it should be taken seriously and the make-up should be done right. Just take a look at Robert Downey, Jr. playing a Caucasian method actor, Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder. In the film Lazarus appears stuck in his role as a black soldier, Sergeant Lincoln Osiris. Most importantly, his make-up is very convincing, even though the audience knows Downey's character is only playing the role of another race. Moving on - the good points aside, I'm not sure why the film has received such high ratings from viewers. Nearly three hours of zipping back and forth at random between 6 different plots is a daunting task for the audience to keep pace with, and I agree with others that it would have fared much better as a mini-series on HBO or something. However, even this isn't the film's biggest sin. The biggest flaw of the film is that the writers try to force connections between the various plots and time-lines where, for the most part, none exists.'I've read letters written by this so-and-so musician from 36 years ago' and bam! There's a connection¬Ö Or 'I've seen a film about the life of this so-and-so author from 132 years ago' and bam! There's a connection¬Ö Give me a break! That's no more a connection than me one day listening to a little known composer like Hungary's Zoltan Kodaly (with no previous exposure or recollection of him), then developing an instant connection to the guy. It's shallow and a cheap way to move the plot along. With the way the movie zips back and forth between story lines, most people had trouble just figuring out what the heck was going on, let alone trying to recognize the connections between the different plots. Which brings me to my last disappointment: the movie makers ask the audience to investment nearly three hours of their time to this project, which requires the viewer to use vast amounts of mind power unlike any other film. The suspense builds, builds, and then builds some more but in the end Cloud Atlas didn't really deliver the 'bang'; makes one feel cheap and dirty after giving this film so much time and cerebral commitment. That's not a good thing¬Ö There's also a preachy theme that runs throughout all of the 6 story lines (some more than others), so it wasn't a big surprise that the filmmakers would try to end things on a high moral point. But it misses the mark, and only furthers my opinion that they rushed each story in order to cram them all into one movie. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind preachiness in a film, so long as it's warranted. Here, the stories just don't resonate the deep meaning that the movie makers are trying to get you to buy into. Sorry.",6,2,6,21 May 2014
