Hereditary," Bad beyond scale
","This is just shockingly dumb, sad and disappointing movie. The parts of the plot seem to be taken from a dozen of other horror movies but put together they just mean nothing. It was not scary, not funny, not interesting at all. The main substance of the movie is a misery of a family falling apart, like 'what shall we come up with next to make the audience feel even more sad and miserable?' The only nice thing were the outside shots of the house with decent shining cars in front of it.",1,6,14,30 June 2018
