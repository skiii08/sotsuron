Iron Man 3," The way to get the 'Real Mandarin' in the next movie.
","Right now everyone knows about the the most ridiculous Twist in history of cinema(the lamest strategy used by a director).Do you think everything has happened and we have no choice?!?!....No! we have a choice...a hope!Black has thrown Iron man franchise in to the dark pit(just like bane threw Bruce in to the pit in TDKR)But now we have to get Iron man out of it,So here is my plan.And this is what anyone who could take on this franchise should do! Making The real Mandarin the villain in next IM movie! It should be a sequel(with or without RDJ) So this is the story..Although IM 3 is so lame, I found a silver lining in it.Now i think this movie has laid down a good foundation for a possible Mandarin outing in near future,despite all its plot holes.Do you ever guessed how Aldrich got all his money to do such research? Do you ever thought why he is having dragon tattoos on his chest? or why is he having such dragon statues and symbols when Trevor's TV Announcements were filming?? Or if he was actually the head of Ten Rings Organization ,what was the reason for him to name his organization as Ten Rings????That name never fits with his personality by any means,its so weird!!.....Did Tony ever think about that weird strange connection in this movie????Black must have included such a scene where Tony puzzled and thinking about all this.And he has lot of clues to think on this matter.Now we come to the real Mandarin.So this real Mandarin as usual in comics a wealthy Chinese who's been raised by his aunt,a regional ruler in a Chinese province(a post which has been inherited by his father),a very fine martial artist and later discovers an alien ship(Makluans) crashed on Earth 1000s of years ago and finds the 10 alien rings(each with a specific power)whom now seeks to make china his empire and rule the whole world(and to watch the west burns)from his global terrorist organization. Aldrich is actually been hired by real Mandarin,the invisible head of Ten Rings Org. He ordered Killian to hire Trevor to symbolize himself and as the false head of Ten rings.Every word Trevor said were all thoughts of Mandarin(simply its his script),his plans....And Trevor doesn't know anything about Mandarin and he thinks it's all Aldrich's plans!!So now Aldrich is dead(although we didn't see his corpse he is supposed to be killed by Potts)and Trevor is imprisoned but nothing is over yet until the real face of Ten Rings reveal........Now everything is set for Mandarin,the arch nemesis of Iron Man for a close encounter with Stark!!!!!!!",1,7,16,3 May 2013
