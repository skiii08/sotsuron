The Blair Witch Project," Strangest movie ever made !
","What's that ? What a bizarre movie ! They said that it was the next exorcist !? NO WAY ! We are far beyond the exorcist. The exorcist is a classic. This is NOT a classic. Maybe some will say that I didn't understand the plot line of the film, that I didn't focus enough on it, but I didn't find much sense in it. There they are three kids with cameras, in a search of the Loch Ness monster ! And by the way, they were lost and they were camping near a river. Everybody knows that if you follow the current of the river, you will find a village, a city or at least civilization ! It didn't cost much to produce ? Well, that 's all that is worth from my point of view .",6,0,2,25 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very good
","A very good movie. Being a big fan of the first trilogy, I had some difficulties on the beginning with the caracters. (Who is Qui-Gon Jinn ? never heard of him in the first trilogy !)After the prologue, when they met Anakin Skywalker, that was amazing !I can't wait for the next movie.",8,0,0,25 June 1999
Slap Shot," A classic !
","This is my favorite movie of all-time ! But I have to say that the french version is better than the original version. I'm from Montreal, Canada, so, a french canadian, though I own both versions of the movie,the french version is the better one.",9,1,4,25 June 1999
