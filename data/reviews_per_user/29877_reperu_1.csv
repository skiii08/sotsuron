The Hangover," Hugely overrated
","In my opinion is overrated. I voted 1 (one) for this movie hoping to lower a bit the 8.something rating. I didn't pay to see it, it was almost free on the internet. Maybe it's not as bad as many of the new movies from Hollywood but no way this is a top 250 movies all the time. I was expecting, in many situations, that the story will get more complicated but instead it was another dot on the linear path of the story. Last 20 minutes were completely out of fun or suspense. So, overall not a good story no such act or quote to remember. Many will say: 'It's just a comedy don't look too hard, it's a movie for watching at home during week-end, not demanding to understand, just fun and relaxing' I will reply to them: ' I hate that kind of movies!'",1,31,55,15 September 2009
