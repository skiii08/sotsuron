Saturday Night Fever," One of the best dancing scenes in film history
",I really love Travolta in this and his dancing scenes. I like the realism reflecting the times and I like the story.,8,0,1,3 March 2019
Now You See Me," Good Acting but a Rerun
","The editing and acting was on point. However, it felt like a cheap remake of The Prestige/The Illusionist meets Oceans 11. I found the entire thing unoriginal with cheap camera tricks showing the magic tricks. The movie sets up the plot so the audience expects something spectacular and smart, but it ends up being a cheap way out. I was engaged throughout the entire thing but was left disappointed at the end. Maybe I had high hopes for a magic trick flick.",7,0,1,29 June 2018
A Quiet Place," Good Solid Thriller
","Krasinski thrived in his directorial debut. The tension, plot, and storytelling were excellent. I loved the chemistry between Krasinski and Emily Blunt. It makes the film so much more endearing knowing that they are married in real life.The monsters and tension in this film remind me exactly like the aliens and film style of the movie in 'Signs'. Many of the scenes are exactly alike. I got the feels near the end with the selflessness that contributes to the family ties and the meaning of sacrificial love. Great experience!",9,3,6,12 May 2018
The Greatest Game Ever Played," More Than a Sports Movie
","After watching this movie a dozen times, I asked myself, 'Why am I so attached to this film even though I'm not the biggest golf fan?'. The answer is simply great cinema with great characters. The characters in this 1913 story carry the plot. No golf swing is the same because the audience sees it from a different character's perspective which keeps the story moving. The director, Bill Paxton, knows what he is doing with the camera, story, and characters. The editing and pacing are so good that you don't even notice it towards the end. The clothing designs and dialogue are authentic. The movie is so much more than an 'inspirational sports movie', though it is inspirational. Themes of social class and family ties convey a greater significance that leads to a rewarding payoff! People often tell me that they passed on this movie because of the melodramatic title or the fact that they could not get past the half hour mark. The first act builds on the character structure for the next acts. I can assure you that if you stick with the story, you will not be disappointed!",9,0,0,18 August 2018
