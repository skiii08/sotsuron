Iron Man 3," Huge Disappointment
","I'm not a die hard fan of the series but I enjoyed the first two. I was extremely disappointed during and after the film ended. Stark's actions and decisions didn't make any sense and I'm getting tired of his arrogance and sarcasm. Didn't have any of the 'magic' from the first two films. I didn't feel his character evolved in any manner and, in fact, he seems to have regressed. I was told there were a lot of one liners that were funny but they were missed on me. Very little humor and unbelievable how immature Stark has become. I won't give away the ending but it was obvious what would occur and not enough to pull the whole movie together. It's a shame but I think they should stop now. Please, just stop the madness! Wish I could get my time and money back.",3,1,3,26 May 2013
