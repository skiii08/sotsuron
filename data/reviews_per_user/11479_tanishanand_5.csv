The Incredible Hulk," One of the most underrated movies of all time.
","The Incredible Hulk was undoubtedly one of the most underrated movies made in Superhero film history. Both in terms of box office as well as reviews. Nevertheless, for me it will always be a film that, for me, signified an era of Superhero movies. The Incredible Hulk NAILED pretty much everything. The action, The acting, The sense of Fun and excitement that the movie had was matched only by Ironman 1 released around the same time. Edward Norton was and will always be for me THE Hulk and THE Perfect Bruce Banner. In fact, I don't think that a Hulk movie can possibly get better. This film is, for me, ANY DAY, a Perfect 10/10.",9,1,3,23 November 2016
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Best Bourne film and one of the best action films in history...
","As much as I hate to admit it, it took a second viewing for The Bourne Ultimatum to really connect with me. Each and every second of the film had a purpose. The film truly re- defines the word 'THRILLER'.The film, in my opinion, perfected the art of perfection. The acting, the direction, the action, the thrill, the sheer sense of intrigue that is carried throughout the film, everything is just excellent. Matt Damon is at the top of his game and is more compelling than ever. Another thing that should be duly noted is the MUSIC. Now, the music of all of the Bourne films is brilliant. It is simply majestic. But this time around, it is just... magical. Right from the very first frame (The Universal Logo), the music is absolutely breathtaking. The Bourne Ultimatum defines what a smart action thriller means to me. It is PERFECT. Flawless. But most of all, The Bourne Ultimatum defines an era of terrific movies that, sadly, will never come back.",10,1,1,13 February 2017
Logan," They don't make films like this anymore.
","I watched Logan earlier today. I loved it. Whether it was the acting of each and every cast member, whether it was the tone, whether it was the script or the pacing or the action sequences or the story or even the well-timed humour, I loved it all. At the same time, Logan was heartbreaking.It was indeed tragic to see that my favorite characters, my heroes being killed and decimated. It was painful to see X-24 stabbing Professor-X, who had just saying that it had been one of his happiest nights in recent memory. I cried when blood started to ooze out of the mouth of an utterly confused Professor-X, who had absolutely not the faintest of idea of what had just happened. Hugh Jackman has proved that he was born for the role of Wolverine. This is his best performance to date. He might, and I hope, win an Oscar. Sir Patrick Stewart was at his best too. Just looking at what had become of him was instantly upsetting.I salute the entire cast and crew of Logan. Thank you. Logan is more than just a movie. It is the best.",9,4,11,12 March 2017
Wonder Woman," Despite some minor shortcomings, Wonder Woman is an enjoyable film.
","Wonder Woman is the best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises. Now that isn't saying much, but it's a fact. The two DCEU movies before Wonder Woman, Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad have been horrendous misfires. Wonder Woman is definitely the breakthrough DC needed.The best part about Wonder Woman? That's Wonder Woman. Yes, Gal Gadot is now irreplaceable as the titular character. She has executed the role flawlessly. I can not think of anyone else as in her place now. Chris Pine has also done an excellent job. He has truly given a memorable and joyful performance as the male lead. In fact, the excellent performances and direction are the biggest strengths of the film. The setting of World War I is perfectly portrayed with attention to detail.However, the movie is certainly not flawless. Some of the shortcomings I noticed are:<ul><li>The Climax of the film. While Steve Trevor's death scene is well done, the sequence that follows is largely underwhelming. In fact, the portrayal of Ares himself is quite underwhelming. His presence is felt throughout the film, but in person he is in the movie for less than 20 minutes and isn't at all threatening in the very least. Danny Huston, who plays the other major negative role is sadly one-dimensional and bland. Though in his defense, his role was a bit poorly written in my opinion.</li></ul>-I also felt the pace of the movie slows down unnecessarily at certain scenes. Mainly the boat scene in which Diana and Steve leave Themiscyra. I would have much rather preferred the scene to be a lot briefer. Some portions of the conversation were not important and slowed down the movie. Same goes with the dance scene in the second half. Despite the quibbles noted above, Wonder Woman is a well-made film. It could have been slightly better, but it's still quite good. And as noted, the performances and the direction are the biggest strengths of the film. Also, I appreciate the lighter tone of the movie, in contrast to the other DCEU movies, which had a very dull tone. The film is a pure origin story and plays no role in any sort of universe-building. It might not be completely path-breaking, but Wonder Woman is a must-watch, no doubt about it. Watch it for... Wonder Woman.",7,4,10,4 October 2017
Iron Man," MY OPINION: Probably the best film ever made.
","2008. I wonder if it is just a co-incidence that Incredible Hulk, The Dark Knight and Iron Man (my top 3 movies of all time), all came in the year 2008. That was a time when the Golden Era of superhero movies was at it's most 'golden'. Each of these three films was magnificent. I often wonder that why films like these are so hard to make nowadays.Iron Man was a film the likes of which had never been seen before. It had that surprise element that superhero movies nowadays don't have, I had never ever seen anything like Iron Man when it came out. It truly was, the first of it's kind. Beautifully directed, wonderfully written, superbly acted and thoroughly entertaining, Iron Man was the film which could be watched again and again and again and again without being bored. It is probably the best film ever made, with the only movies in the same league as this one are The Dark Knight and Incredible Hulk.",10,2,5,21 February 2017
