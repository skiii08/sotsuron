Antz," Copy Cat
","Take cheap ant jokes, old Woody Allen jokes, fight scenes ripped off from a flop 'Starship Troopers' and what do you have? The sorriest competitor to ever step into the ring with Disney. Some people love this movie becuz it's different for animation, y'know. They say 'Bitch' and 'Hell'. The real story behind Antz is an old Pixar employee coming over to Dreamworks and trying to get revenge at Pixar and Disney and 'A Bug's Life' by ripping off the idea of using ants as lead characters and rushing through a poorly written script, gangly looking characters (even the females Sharon Stone and Jennifer Lopez look too similar to the male characters) Anyways, take all the improbabilities and scary animation... and you are left with a handful of celebrities trying to pull their fans into the movie.If you're a Woody Allen fan, you should check the movie out. He's the only plus side to this movie.",1,7,19,25 April 1999
A Bug's Life," What's not to love?
","You have jokes that kids love, other jokes that adults love. Animation that reigns supreme and funnier celebs then Antz (Woody Allen being Antz's only funny person). Pixar rules all! Their script is better then ANTZ, their jokes are funnier, and they have a storyline! You gotta check out this movie, especially if you've seen Antz and liked it, you'll want to see the better movie.",10,0,0,25 April 1999
