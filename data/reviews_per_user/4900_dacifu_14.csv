Sucker Punch," I liked it
","Someone here wrote 'I'm not sure how this movie got such rave reviews by some people, oh wait yes I can, the ONLY people who can possibly like this film are fantasy/anime/comic book junkies!' OK...so? It's a movie made for the comic book/anime lover. With a title like 'Sucker Punch' what do you expect. It's not the stupid English patient.The girl escape reality in two level. At in the hospital she retreat to a 'brothel' and when she dances in this brothel she escape to another fantasy world that is related to what she and her friends are trying to achieve.Snyder is a great director who can do very visually stunning films such as this one and 300. Can't wait to see what the new superman movie will be like. Hopefully better than the last one.I liked but like I said is a movie for the comic book/anime lover it's not for everyone Thank you for reading.",8,2,7,17 June 2011
Spider-Man 3," sorry...........what?
","spoiler ahead!!!! what happened? this wasn't spider man. No spider senses whatsoever. In the first 2 movies and all the comic books, spidey's senses play a big role and in this movie there was none. The goblin grab spider from behind, venom take him by surprise, a meteor hit the ground 30 feet away and nothing. Topher as Brock didn't quite work. For some reason, some really bizarre reason, the movie turn into a Mexican telenovela. What's with the crying? it was painful to watch MJ and PP crying like babies half of the freaking movie. And the dancing!!! OMG, it was just plain stupid. Half of he movie spider man has no mask on him, why? special effects were pretty good and the final figth was actually enjoyable, but overall they killed spider man with this so called movie. why stan lee allow something like this happens to his creation? outrageous",2,0,0,17 May 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not totally there
","First of all I would like to say that I really hate people that write long reviews of movies. After all is just a movie is not like a vital part of history. So I will keep it short.Not a bad movie. The action scenes are well worthy of a Terminator franchise. The main problem I have with this film is mostly the character of 'John Connor'. Maybe it was the writers or maybe just the actor who was wrongly casted. I don't know.In the first film they start with this mystical image of the one man responsible for the survival of the human race 'John Connor' In the second film we have a smart, witty and somehow strong representation of the kid who will become the leader of the resistance against the machine.However; in this film we have a sissy, insecure, scary cat with an amazing lack of confidence dude by the name of 'John Connor'. The portrayal of the character was pathetic. Are you telling that this joke of a man will be the saviour of the human race. Sad.Then the other problem I have with this movies is that stupid scene was the one where Arnold gets reprogrammed by the T-X. John Connor asks the T-800 not to kill him and the Terminator obeys. Reese said in part 1 Â„It can't be bargained with' and now John did just that. Sad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.Anyhow, I promised I would keep it short so I will.Seeya",3,0,1,13 June 2011
The Fast and the Furious," i think i saw this movie before!!
","i am the only one who found this movie a mere copy of Point Break? is the same script!! let's see:Point Break: cop goes undercover to catch a bunch of thieves. Fast and Furious: cop goes undercover to catch a bunch of thieves.PB: cop became best friends with the leader of the gang. F&F: cop became best friends with the leader of the gang.PB: the girl is the crook ex-girlfriend. F&F: the girl is the crook sister (well..).PB: cop catch the bad guy/best friend in an amazing chase and let him go. F&F: cop catch the bad guy/best friend in an amazing chase and let him go.just change the surfboards for fast cars and is the same flick, the same plot. Is even the same freaking city. his just proved that movies nowadays are lacking originality. what's next....",1,4,11,6 March 2007
Batman Begins," the only batman movie
","finally a Batman that can erase from our memory the previous insults made by Burton and Schumacher. This is the movie all Batman fan wanted for a very long time now, the cast is perfect. bale is just excellent, the acting is good, You got actors of the size of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, just amazing. The direction was very good and the story is pretty close to the comics book. I used to watch the original TV show when i was a kid and even then I was hoping for a darker Batman. The first movie came along and it was a kick below for everything I was hoping for in a Batman movie. All those previous flick were nothing but an slap in the face to Batman's fans around the world. Thank you mister Nolan for ignoring the previous films and give us the hope to forget the previous Batman movies. let consider this one the first Batman movie.",10,2,2,26 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," NO!!!!!! no. no. no
","...can somebody please tell me that they are going to do another movie where the explanation to this one would be that it was just a nigthmare. Or maybe somebody will travel back in time and change this stupid flick, please. First to all the previous films weren't that good. They got rogue, Cyclops and everybody else all wrong from the beginning. But let focus on this one:Scott and Charles got killed for some reason, WHY? if you ever read the comic book they are main characters all the way trough. So, there is no reason for their death.Phoenix is NOT a product of Jean Grey double personality. The phoenix is a cosmic entity!!! for FS. And Jean's love for Scott is the only thing able to stop the Phoenix.Mystique, Rogue and Magneto lost their powers, are you kidding me? main characters here. And rogue is all wrong too. She supposed to have Carol Danvers's powers and be involve in a romantic relationship with Gambit, who, by the way, where the hell was he?So, the way i see it the people who made this movie never read a comic book before and they didn't like the story so they make sure to kill every possibility of a sequel. Which in my opinion would be unnecessary. So, do yourself a favour and forget about this movies and stick with the comic books. Now if you have no idea whatsoever about the marvel universe maybe and just maybe you can find this movie OK, but for an x-men fan like myself this in nothing but an insult and a wasted of money and time",1,1,3,22 May 2007
Across the Universe," Let's say Hair and Moulin Rouge had a baby...,
","....and it's the Antichrist.I Hated this movie sooo much. The only reason I went to see it is because my wife begged me. I couldn't find a way to get out of this deal and I put myself in misery for a very very very long time. There is no plot in the film, there is no character development, the psychodelic scenes were too much. Between senseless and stupid, they should've give a warning 'Please get really high before seeing this movie. I can't find words to describe how bad this movie is, I read other reviews here and one person said that he/she stood up and cheered , really? I hope it was a joke. This film is plain and pure garbage, definitely between my top 5 worst movies ever. Not even a 1.",Null,1,6,13 November 2007
The Mist," just bad!!!
","What ruined this movie for me was the religious propaganda that went on and on for over half of the film. The film had the potential to be great but it wasn't! 3 soldiers acting like school girls without taking any action in the events. Cheap cgi fx. The pathetic Christian women that all of a sudden earned a bunch of followers. Although she is known to be the local nut, or cat lady if you wish. In less than an hour almost everybody put aside survival instinct and logical thinking and without questioning decided to follow a crazy lady who claims to know everything is going on and stated that the only way to save everybody is by killing a little boy, because that is what 'god' wants Nothing but crap. That is what ruined this film for me. I hated it.",1,1,6,14 June 2008
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Boring
","First off I do not have a personal vendetta against the saga. And I had never read the books. Having said that this is my review of this film BORING!!!!! This film is lacking everything: acting, script, story everything. Seriously. You have a vampire and a werewolf fighting over who is probably the most boring human on earth. She is a pretty girl don't take me wrong but personality wise she is plain dull.If I a were the vampire dude my thoughts would be 'screw this I am a vampire with the gift of eternity. Why do I want to waste my time with a girl who has an emotional baggage of the size of a house' You have an immortal dude with zero dignity. Pathetic.If I were the werewolf dude I would be like 'why do I care for this dull chick? She is lame' Anyways. Ackward scenes. Minimal action. Bad story. Horrible acting. And like the main character 'boring'.By the way I never saw the ending. It was too much torture.",1,8,11,24 August 2010
Paranormal Activity," I think that.....
","....people who found this movie scary might be too sensitive or fearful to pretty much anything out there. Seriously, 45 minutes into the film and I was wondering why everybody call this film scary at all. 45 minutes into the film and nothing happened. There was one scene that lasted about 5 minutes and it was nothing but a shot of this retarded couple sleeping through the night and the only thing that happened during the night was that the bedroom door moved about 5 inch. That freak you out people? c'mon The Blair Witch Project was good, kind of scary and original. But this movie is pure garbage. For real...I turned the video off close to an hour into the movie. I rather watch wedding videos of people I don't even know. The only scary thing about this movie is that they are making a sequel and most likely a bunch of mentally handicap people will soiled themselves over a freaking curtain moving back and forth....and they wont shut up about how scary this it. Save yourself the time and pain and watch a video of Rosie O'Donnell doing an striptease instead....because that would be definitely scary.",1,2,4,10 April 2010
Avatar," Once again....
","....Cameron sets the standards....back in the 80's a revolutionary movie called 'The Terminator' changed the way action movies should be....a decade later 'Terminator 2' changed the way FX should be.....later 'Titanic' made a whole generation travel deep into the ocean and history.....now 'Avatar' had taken a whole generation into the future of film-making. Imagine 'Star Wars' or The Lord of the Ring' with this technology. The film is simply put 'Amazing'...there is nothing wrong with it....the acting is good the FX are out of this world...the story though is bit predictable and probably done before..really, there was nothing original about the plot....but who cares...it wasn't about the storyline...Cameron showed the world he can deliver a good story with 'Titanic'....this movie was about a trip...from the way movies are make today to the way movies will be make from now on. An amazing experience that should be seen in big screen.....3 hours well spent. Definitely the best movie in the last decade.",9,2,6,23 December 2009
X-Men: First Class," Did not like it
","8.2 out of 10?...seriously? the first x men was OK...the second was bad...the third was a bag full of puke...wolverine origins was a rape....but this one is worst than any of the other x men movies.What's wrong with this pile of garbage? 1- Professor X and Mystique are related? WTF 2-Alex Summers and not Scott? Why? Scott Summers is one of the original X Men, not Alex 3-Where is Angel? I mean Warren Kenneth Worthington III not that little butterfly girl.4- Where is Iceman? 5- Where is Marvel Girl? What a silly plot. Hollywood can't make good movies anymore. They take a good source and just violated the fans with some stupid adaptation.What's with the romantic relation between Beast and Mystique? Where that came from? Mystique mated with Azazel and that's where Nightcrawler comes from.Stupid movie. I have no idea why the rating is so high.The Wolverine cameo was kind of cool though.",1,90,172,10 June 2011
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I liked it
","**spolers ahead***** Long? Yes. Slow? At the beginning the pace was a little slow but was necessary to build the story.The cast was great. Afleck as Batman was superb. Cavill as Supes was great and Gador as wonder woman was perfect.Don't listen to critics. I hated the Revenant and critics loved it. I hated Babel and critics loved it. Don't listen to critics.I read somewhere that Lynda Carter complained about Gadot's WW custom not having the blue, red and white. Really? First off; it's a comic book character so who cares and two, WW is from themyscira which is like Greece, so she's not American, she's not from Texas. The same goes for the ppl complaining about a non American actress playing the character. She's not American!! WW is not American.Cyborg cameo was OK.Aquaman cameo was pretty good. Momoa certainly looks the part and again for those who think that the USA is the only country in the world; flash news!! Aquaman is half a fish, so who cares he's not a blonde/blue eyes from Minnesota.Flash cameo.......I don't know...the flash from TV seems more the part.Overall good movie. Not sure is Doomsday should've been the main villain. And the whole plot of Luthor creating Doomsday was kind of mmeh. Doomsday should've been save for when the Justice League is fully established.Interested to see how they bring back the boy scout after this one.Good movie. Don't compare this film to the Marvel films. Don't be an idiot. They are just movies so just shut off your brain and enjoy. More important things out there that argue about a movie about ppl with powers.Cheers",10,4,8,29 March 2016
Furious 7," Was Uwe Boll behind this? cause is one bad movie.
","Seriously!! This movie was simply awful. Unrealistic even for a film. A helicopter flying above Los Angeles and no government agency picked that up and do something about it. Explosions all over the city and you don't see one single police/military vehicle. Explain to me how a group of garage monkeys without any military background can survive all those attacks and military personal dies left and right. Toretto (Diesel) jumped in a car from the top of a very high building while collapsing. For some anti-physic law reason he fall on top of the wreckage. They pull him out of the car and has no visible injuries but appears dead. Walker's character start CPR (which by the way CPR does not restart the heart)but then he stop cause Toretto is freaking dead; however, Letty manage to bring him back to life with the power of love. The Rock saw the mayhem in the news while at the hospital. So obviously he suit up. WHy did he have his gear and so many weapons at the hospital. Everybody who ever been at the hospital for just one night knows how hard is to find your own underwear, let alone your entire wardrove, but he conveniently didn't have that issue. Then he stole an ambulance(cause after all the destruction there were no injuries and nobody was in need of one so he found one just parked outside the hospital with the keys in ready to go)and then he managed to find everybody and crashed the ambulance on a freaking drone while jumping head on from a bridge and sustained no injuries. The action was dumb. Tony Jaa was underused. How the heck did Jason Statham survived? again, with no visible injuries, not even limping. F&F 5 and F&F 6 were actually pretty good but this one was just an abomination. I have so many thing to say about it but I already spent too much time on this. The Paul Walker send of/tribute was very nice though. RIP.",1,2,16,20 May 2015
