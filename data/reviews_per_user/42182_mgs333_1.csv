Blade Runner 2049," A movie made by formula and commitee, lacking any real soul.
","I like some of Villeneuve's movies like The Arrival but this one failed to engage me. If it matters, I haven't seen any of the original Blade Runner movies but I know the premise so I don't think it should affect my enjoyment (or lack thereof) of this movie. The movie just feels like it goes by a checklist of things to check off (formulaic) and lacks any real sense of dramatic tension or surprise. The pacing also feels needlessly slow and any tension or drama that was built up just fizzes away. I know Ryan Gosling is a replicant/robot but it's boring to watch someone who never changes his expression even once during the whole movie. There are actually ways to show emotion without expressions but I just felt like I saw a mannequin for nearly 3 hours. Overall a disappointment.",5,2,3,7 September 2019
