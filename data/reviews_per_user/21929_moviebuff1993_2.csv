Iron Man 3," It is a good, summer action movie!
","So after watching The Avengers, I was already looking forward to see another Iron Man movie. Iron Man 3 delivers thrills, twists and humor, even though it's bogged down by a few defects.The best parts in this film are the performances by Robert Downey Jr. plus Ben Kingsley, the witty dialogue, and some of the best action sequences I've seen in a comic book film.The downside is that Tony Stark's conflict isn't drawn out well, and the final battle isn't as emotional as it was built up to be.I have to say that this is better than the second Iron Man; I cannot remember almost anything from that film! Don't expect Iron Man 3 to be as big as Iron Man 1 and The Avengers; however, I guarantee you'll walk out happy. It is a good, summer action movie!",8,1,3,9 May 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," If you're a fan of the previous two, this will leave you satisfied.
","The Dark Knight Rises does indeed 'rise' in this film. Chris Nolan has done it again, giving us the conclusion we have anticipated for four long years. Nolan manages to go full circle with the third and final installment of the 'Dark Knight' trilogy. The story is filled with twists and turns, along with good character development. Actors' performances (particularly Bale, Hardy, and Hathaway) and Nolan's direction for keeping me on the edge of my seat and guessing what was going to happen next. I will admit that I am starting to see the flaws in this film; therefore, I will not say that this is my favorite in the trilogy. I will say that by the last half hour to forty five minutes, I was in for an outstanding climax. If you're a fan of the previous two, this will leave you satisfied.",9,2,6,21 July 2012
