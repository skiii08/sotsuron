"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Where was Hugh Grant?
","A jolly good jape - in the Notting Hill/4 Weddings mould. In fact if Hugh Grant were playing the lead role it would be a typical Hugh Grant film! The plot holds together nicely and you can read the details in other reviews, but there are some brilliant performances including one from Dennis's (Pegg) Asian landlord Mr Ghoshdashtidar (Harish Patel) who completely steals the wheelchair scene. There are cameo performances by Stephen Merchant and David Walliams which add nothing special other than to give the film a certain 'street cred'.David Schwimmer's debut as a director is a wholesome family effort, pleasing harmless fun, and should be viewed as such. If you are looking for deep meaning and plot twists - forget it. It does exactly what it says on the tin.",7,2,5,4 October 2007
