Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Save the analysis for your debate class
","I was also privileged to see this movie on what is touted to be the largest screen in Texas.  All I can say is: the Special Effects were good eye-candy (although not as good as the Matrix which, with it's highly original plot, edges TPM as my favourite movie this year).  The sound was awesome.  My teeth rattled with every passing star cruiser.My only problem was that wretched Jar Jar Binks character.  He sounded so much like a Rastafarian, I thought he was going to whip out some ganja and start lighting up: 'Meesa name Jar Jar. 'ere Mon! Take a good blast, will'ya?'Other than that and the silly waste of 5 minutes at the end of the movie, I thought this was a wonderful film.  I look forward to seeing Anakin Skywalker duel it out with Obi Wan and falling into a pit of lava after bagging the babe queen (narf!)",10,0,0,17 June 1999
