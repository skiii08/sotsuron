Blade Runner 2049," No limit to create bad stuff !
","No limit to create bad stuff !
Score: 2/10
Hollywood shows us once again that there is no limit to the creation of bad movies (we should say 'things').This 'thing' is incredibly bad. However, since I find it so bad 'The People' will love it. It is not surprising to see an 8.3 / 10 for this s**t.If you have never seen the movie 'Blade Runner (1982) (ATTENTION only the one with the voiceover of' Rick Deckard 'is good) I invite you to get it but it is very rare. We made a waste with the 'Director's cut' version or other versions as bad. It is like taking a Rembrandt and painting anything over with a child's hands.Theory about Hollywood movie directors
Alternatively, they were born rich and idiots and / or they took too many drugs (LSD, heroin, cocaine, mescaline, etc.) being young (they probably still take). Therefore, when they listen to their s**t they find it wonderful even if in fact it looks like their movies (finally the story) were created by chimpanzees.The sad thing is that 'The People', often people working in places as s**tty as McDonalds minimum wage, will not hesitate to pay $ 20 to see this kind of s**t and they will be happy with that. Another proof that we do not want to educate the people.The only good thing in this 'thing' is the photo and the fact that we see some buttocks. However, if you think you see the buttocks of the stars think again. We have been using liners for a long time and we are paying $ 20 to show their breasts, buttocks, etc.Remember that actors/actress are professional liars and that even if they claim to have done nude scenes it is completely false. Also with computers or fix everything now and have made believe what you want to the people.Harrisson Ford
I have never found an excellent 'Harrison Ford' but I found it very lucky to shoot in some 'good' movies (Star Wars , Blade Runner, and Witness). He has not played in 'good' movies for a long time, but in medium or very bad movies.Sean Young
She had the wisdom not to turn in this turnip.Budget
$ 150,000,000 (estimated)
The more time passes, the 'movies' are expensive and the worse each other.
What matters are special effects and creating 'stories' that a 5 year old would be able to write.Of the 150 million, there are probably 100 million going to the stars. All millionaires and all suffering from the same mental illness as all the rich: greed.

It is as if engineers were constantly getting money for the buildings (bridges, skysc**pers, etc.) they created in their past.However, when we are 'Stars' (nothing is too pretentious for stars) we 'deserve' to be covered with gold at every moment of life. In addition, the people of the adored...At least 95% of all that is produced now in Hollywood is just c**p. In addition, the irony is that this s**t costs 100 times more than 30 years ago!",2,2,4,6 January 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Very very very very boring
","This is the worst film I've seen so far Tarantino. The film is much too long and the story is far from convincing.This is particularly unfortunate that there are many good actors and actresses. When you go see a Tarantino movie is expected to more than most regular movie.This is not even a good movie to rent. And even less to see the theater. And forget to make a gift unless it is your enemy.The film is extremely disappointing. It continues to expect that there's something interesting. And this expectation turns quickly to boredom.If the intention was to make a film of black humor and / or a funny movie, it completely missed.A film to avoid at all costs. Even if you're a big fan of Tarantino.",2,7,13,2 December 2009
Oldboy," Masterpiece
","I am not Asian nor pro-Asian. I do not live in Asia. I try always to be objective.And objectively this film is really very good. A masterpiece.I believe that it is the first time that I comment on a film and gives 9/10. I NEVER give 10/10 cause NOTHING is perfect. But this movie is near perfection. This Korean film is remarkable. WOWWWWWWWWWWWW !!!!!!!!!!!!!All is good in this film. Actors and actresses, photography, music, and of course the history (the scenario).That made well at least 20 years that I had not seen a film of this kind.It is well one of rare Asian films where nudity is seen (without vulgarity of course).I would give a Oscar for this film. But unfortunately it is not as that which that it's work in Hollywood. It is necessary to form part of the 'Hollywood Clan'.I hope that the authors of this film will continue to make also remarkable films and that it will not make like Hollywood. To make turnips and to only think of the money.In any case Korean gives a good cinematographic lesson to American.I you council highly to buy this film because it is a rare masterpiece since they are 25 last years.It's good to see a film where we don't know all the story even before to have it. It's good to see they are again some (but few) people who are able to use their brain to make remarkable movie. It's good to see people who make movie who don't think that people who watch movies are all idiots...",9,9,18,7 September 2007
Alexander," 'Braveheart effect (2)'
","This movie is a lot bad. Have no sense to find money and create a so ridiculous 'thing'.I have a theory which I give the name of 'Braveheart effect (2)'. Since the movie Braveheart -1995 (which was good) give money to producer of Hollywood, some guys things 'Why not make similar movies and so win the jackpot?'So Gladiator (2000) come, and a 'series' follow - King Arthur (2004), Alexander (2004),etc.Another theory is that maybe Oliver Stone smoke too much Opium or his head come so big that he think all what he can do will be 'wonderful'!Or he wanted to show that 'Alexander' was gay. What a new !A lot of guys in past was gay. Even, IF Jesus exist it was probably gay. So what ? It's not a reason to make a so soporific movie.Really don't buy neither rent this boring 'movie'. It's pathetic to create this kind of thing in 2004 and when our name is Oliver Stone...",2,2,5,27 March 2005
Snatch," Very Great Movie !
",WoW !First I give 8.5/10 for this movie. But since we can use just integer it's appear 8. This movie is like fresh air in the so close Hollywood world.Not only this movie is very original but all actor are very good. Each contribute to make this film very good.This movie it's the proof they are intelligent guys who are able to create something new and wonderful.And funny ! Sure it's black humor... :)When we listen this movie time stop. Cause we don't see the time. Never we are bore one moment.Music is great too. For me this movie is a classical movie.A movie to have in our collection...,8,0,1,22 May 2005
Dunkirk," In this wonderful capitalist world, criticism has become Terrorist!
","Another film (as in at least 80% of cases) that should have been refrained from doing so much is ridiculous. It still shows that it's not really actors, directors, etc. which are important but the scenario, the story (which accounts for 80% of the films).Film supposedly 'historical' but as in the majority of this type of film we learn nothing at all.We wanted to pay homage in this film:
'This film is dedicated to all of which lives have been impacted by the events at Dunkirk.'What a tribute to have created such a cr***y film!
We can still say that in this film everything is at the same level (ridiculous): scenarios, acting, music, etc. It only has the technicality that is doing well but it is not even a quality because thanks to electronics technology is now easily acquired.This film is not a historical film but is supposed to be a film 'Tribute'. Objective completely missed!When the score of 7.9 / 10, it shows that all data that is in a computer can be tampered with and give the numbers that you want to have. But the important thing is that humans believe in these scores.We should show the score after we have given a note. Since most people are sheep, they are easily influenced. The scores are nothing and this film is the proof.Besides the scores, prices, etc. are never objective. They are given by humans.
If this film had been analyzed objectively it would have been 7.9 but at most 3/10.It is enough to give a name known and bang it is extraordinary even if in fact it is cr***y.If you want to fall asleep this movie is for you. Otherwise it is better to buy a good book on the subject.
Ideally asked a historian and not a store for whom money is the only goal and not history.",2,2,8,10 October 2019
The Da Vinci Code," Zzzzz
",I did not read the book on which this film is based and I do not intend to do it.As you must know as Marie-madeleine never existed just as Jesus was never the son of God since also never existed him.The religions were invented to contain human violence. Some with more developed brains and which wanted controlled the others had the idea to invent Jesus or Mahomet or Boudha or another. And it did not need to fight physically with the others to be able to control the mass of people.There were certainly also groups of misogynists who have create Religions. It is for that which Women are regarded as being worth less than cows in the majority of the religions.,4,1,3,17 January 2007
War of the Worlds," Another crap Remake
","It seems Hollywood has no brains but only greedy, bankers, millionaires and billionaires. It never ceases to take classic films and make turnips. We can put that on big name producers, actors and of course almost unlimited budgets. That money would be better invested in education and health. But as we are sure to make millions of profiles, it is anything. If film 'War of the Worlds' in 1953 was good, things have changed since that time. Including technology and science. And people today, and some are not so naive that 50 years ago. The recovery in 2005 by Spielberg makes no sense. Example: If a superior race of aliens, wanted to invade Earth, it is certain that they would be aware of germs and everything related to the biology. So they do not die of biological causes. And if someone was hiding in a house, and a probe detection, high technology, would be sent, it certainly would detect individuals if cache. Unless there is a secret. This is not the case of the film. And then to take control of the Earth, no need to go to war. Simply check the billionaires. And if the billionaires tell people going to throw in the ocean, the people will smile. In Hollywood, and more generally in the Arts, when someone said that it is 'great', it remains for life. Even if what this artist is crap. And Steven Spielberg is one of those untouchable artists.I give a poor 2/10 for this movie. 1 for technical and 1 for all people who work on it. Except writers which have brain of kids.",2,3,6,25 March 2009
Centurion," Another ridiculous movie
",2/10 The technique is good and the actors not too bad. The music is tolerable. But the story is once again the most stupid is without any logic.Another film of s**t. Certainly it seems almost impossible to rent / buy a movie with a good script today.It seems that those who write for the movies are delayed. Or that they are children of 8 years. The film 'Centurion' has no meaning. Imagine eight well-trained Roman soldiers fleeing on foot in front of 10 barbarians on horseback.It makes no sense. Or the Romans are cowards. In addition there is another Top-Model supposed to be as powerful as a man. It's so ridiculous.This film reminds me of a director / producer who wants to f**k the supermodel and get it done one movie.,Null,2,6,28 October 2011
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Special Effect and that all !
","My score for this film, Star Wars VII - The Force Awakens, is 5/10 maximum. Nothing is original and it is only a pale copy of the first Star Wars IV - A New Hope (1977)The special effects are decent but it almost did it. The scenarios are virtually nonexistent and the story is not new.If the first Star Wars cost $ 11 million, the latest cost 200. This is still 20 times more. Salaries of people do not have as yet increased.In addition, we went to get the fuddy-duddy Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. This has had cost at least 20 million. It is true that on the other hand it changes nothing since in any case all this money will go directly into tax havens and that the stars and the companies attached to this film will not pay any tax as always.They 'gives' 1 million to 'poor' to not pay 10, 100 million or 1 billion (companies like Walt Disney) in taxes! Magnificent. We understand who make the laws and for who!No need to waste your money to see this film. The rich are rich enough even if they think otherwise (this is crazy: misers).Get this movie on forums if you really want to see. But again nothing new. Like all the movies coming out of Hollywood these past 10 years (at least) we only see special effects but for history and although they are just good for ants!",5,11,12,8 April 2016
Back to the Future," Wonderful Movie
","I just buy 'The Complete Trilogy' DVD version of Back to the Future this week. After listen the first movie I can say nothing change about what I think of this movie.Just WONDERFUL! I listen this movie long time ago and liked it a lot. And today I like the same. Even if we are in 2004. I give 9/10 for this movie. It's not cause it's so original but the story is fun. Actor/actress are good. Music is cool. Image (DVD) is very nice. Well ALL about this movie is great.Also I listen Original in French and I'M SO HAPPY the DVD version IS THE SAME and not a idiot 'Director's Cut' version (like for Blade Runner - The Original is a Masterpiece, the Director's Cut is a idiot thing). Just BRAVO for people who take the decision to NOT change NOTHING of this Classical Movie.It's really Classical movie. And for people who don't see it (them) it's a really good gift to give for Christmas.It's fun to listen a movie and be surprised. Again a very Great movie.",9,0,1,21 December 2004
The Great Gatsby," The World of Rich
","The perfect world for the rich exist. This is the Capitalist. When you have money you can do anything. Commit murder, make slave work, hold all the media of the planet and make propaganda you want. For example, to say that it is a Capitalist is a democracy and that all are equal. Which is completely false.But the rich are affected by the two (at least) greatest mental illnesses that exist: Lies and Greed. With both diseases the rich do whatever they want. And in this world what Capitalist are not diseases are the two main human qualities.The People like them as Gods. The people have the same 'qualities' that rich except it has no money. But he dreams of one day be like them and to be able to do everything. To crush others and to be applauded for doing so.The film 'The Great Gatsby' (2013) is just another propaganda film to show combines the rich are good. And the people are too stupid to find that the rich squander fortunes for fun - free since they pay neither taxes nor other things (these are the greatest experts of illusions 'giving $ 1 for one side save face and stealing millions from the other side well hidden) - while millions of people on the planet is starving.The only thing 'great' for the rich are their bank accounts. And even greater is their greed. These are black holes that absorb all the money in the world and will never be useless if not to satisfy their mental illness: Greed.Ironically we take millionaires to play the role of a billionaire. And The People venerate them. This is quite normal because, for example, the United States, it 'educates' (it's more of brainwashing) from birth, the people to venerate money and the rich. And tell them that all are equal, and that by working honestly and hard they can become a millionaire too. This is completely false because to be rich you have to be a liar, greedy, dishonest, hypocritical, sold, selfish, narcissistic, self-centered, etc. In short the 'qualities' that encourages Capitalist.Do you like the rich and their 'history' (always the same, always based on lies)? Well this film is for you. If you are smart (0.0000000000000001% of the population) do not waste your time with this other rich propaganda film.",1,2,4,3 January 2016
