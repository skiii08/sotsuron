Ford v Ferrari," What a ride!!
","I was expecting a good movie about cars and races... and yes it was that but.... it was much more, this movie reminds me Rush ( i really loved this one) with a better scenario, a better acting, some great racing sequence, and a lot of emotions, i was so high that i couldn't believe that this movie was a 2 and half hours, we need more of this movies where humans and relationship between son and dad, boss and workers, friends.... are more important than the CGI! Damon and Bale are on another level that deserves some oscar nominations at least, for sure this is one of my favorite 2019 movies!",10,3,5,3 January 2020
Knives Out," its just a good entertaining.... that's all!!
","It's truly a good movie, a pleasant to watch and have some good times, but not good as 'a mystery whodunit'. Everything is good apart from the 'twist ' and the story was clear halfway, its just a good entertaining.... that's all!",6,5,8,10 January 2020
The Irishman," Mixed feelings.....!
","A long ( too long!? ) movie that left me with a mixed feelings, some useless scenes and boring dialogs almost ruined Scoreses piece, but a very interesting story and a sublime acting ( especially Pesci ) saved the movie without forgetting the sad and brilliant ending ( the last 30 minutes feels like the end for a whole generation). Even with some boring moments this movie deserve the watching and enjoying some great cinema, the one i like without too much CGI only pure genius actors and director!",8,14,27,30 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," No this is not good!
","All the hype and then we had a very bad movie, Infinity War was a great build up for Endgame but the approach was so so bad, time travel to save the dead was a very bad move, so no drama and the end couldn't save the movie, and I'm still wondering why all the hype over Captain Marvel and at the end she was useless?..... Well 2 is more than enough for this mess",2,95,159,30 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What's the point?
","If you have 60 or 70 years old and have some nostalgia about the 60s 70s then this is for you, otherwise go away, boring useless and empty, i still don't understand the meaning of this movie, positive point? Brad Pitt that's all folks!",3,1,2,1 December 2019
1917," Makes me loves cinema again!
","War movies are only made for the emotional part in recent years, then some directors gives us an original vision with a real different approache. After all the years watching movies that only repeating what we already seen i thought i'm done with it, i'm only looking for original ideas, finally i had one with Nolan 'Dunkirk'.... a rare one! Then Mendes did it again...... i almost lost breathing in the first 25 minutes, so intense none stop action without cut (at least i feel it that way), it gives you some break and..... here we go again, till the emotional and brilliant end. Nothing to say about acting and actors they are simply excellent ( especially Mackay ). 1917 is a most watch if you love cinema....",10,0,2,20 January 2020
The Dark Knight," The ultimate movie!
","Everything has been said about this movie.......I will just say I'm still waiting for the 'MOVIE' that can match this, almost perfection in every aspect, if you didn't watch this then you didn't watch a 'MOVIE' yet!",10,2,2,1 October 2019
Midsommar," Fantastic trip!
","I was expecting a horror movie and some scary moments but it wasn't! It's different a unique experience yes this is a true experience, it's disturbing and so strange..... A lot find the end 'stupid' but I don't, it's so perfect just think about it. This is not my best movie but I really like this kind of movies rather than the fully packed action nonsense movies! And a fully deserved 9/10.",9,1,4,26 September 2019
Joker," Human behaviors!
","When you give Authors freedom to put an original idea without the 'making a lot of money factor' you will get some great results!! Joker is one of them, a true masterpiece. Something really unique!, you can't compare it to Nolan's Dark knight Joker, this is totally different. This is almost a question towards humanity. Or how can a small acts give birth to a villain, how a society a and individuals behaviors can create a monster! I really liked this movie!",9,1,3,12 November 2019
Parasite," A Powerful Masterpiece!
","It's hard to describe this movie, i will just say this is a critical point of view about the modern family and society. The transformation from a light comedy to a strange disturbing and a violent movie is unbelievable..... the party scene is a beautiful philosophical portrait about humans, this is truly a Powerful masterpiece.",10,16,25,1 October 2019
