The Blair Witch Project," Disappointed
","0.55 am Leeds, England. Just finished watching THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. It's not on general release here yet, but hey, I'd heard about the film, and got chance to see it on video. Yes, it's different, yes it has suspense. Generally though there is no substance and no decent 'events' within the film. The premise alone may negate the requirement for graphic or typical plot devixes, but you have to question the validity of a film that seeks to exist on a fictional authentic-esque documentary film style but neither shocks, revolts or disturbs to any degree whatsoever. It was though a change not to have familiar predictable shock scenes, over the top mutilation or typical actors, film grade and of course artificial/background soundtrack. As a concept it could run. However, with no plot, it plods. And although the ending was necessarily weird, it just reminded me of the ending of Monty Python's Holy Grail. Vaguely interesting, ultimately very disappointing.",1,2,3,28 September 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," 10 things that made this pathetic
","Okay, John Taylor wrote this elsewhere on here, but it summed up precisely what I thought, so reitterated it:1.It is another teen flick. 2.It is predictable. 3.It is not funny. 4.The characters are not believable. 5.It's boring 6.No school is ever like this one. 7.The ending made me want to puke. 8.Everyone has model looks. 9.The script is tepid. 10.lousy acting. And i could go on. There is nothing in this movie that i havent already seen in every other teen college flick.3 out of 10. And that's GENEROUS.",2,6,16,10 April 2002
