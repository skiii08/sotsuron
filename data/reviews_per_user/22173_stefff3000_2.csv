Sucker Punch," Money for nothing (not even chicks for free)
","What a disappointment to see the director of Watchmen indulge in such a terrible mess. If you want to see annoying weeping teenage whores (hey! that's what they do in the movie!) and unrelated ridiculous action scenes, Sucker Punch will be a treat for you. The actresses can't play and, even worse, they can't handle the action scenes despite the heavy cgi supposed to help. Actually, the cgi is so forced and so ugly that it needed help from helpless performers, tell me about the snake biting its own tail! I can't understand how execs can let such a pile of crap go to the big screen. It's so bad I wish I could erase the very memory of that this movie ever happened.",2,4,13,23 June 2011
No Strings Attached," Too predictable
","### this review may NOT contain spoilers ###I concur this flick is entertaining enough not to bore you to death for 1 and a half hour but that's about it. First of all, you know - before you've seen or read anything about the movie - what you're in for...But if you expect any surprise, you're in for a major disappointment.Ivan Reitman and his writer follow the romantic comedy handbook we all learned to know and love since 'When Harry Met Sally' reared its lovely head and changed the game...almost completely. Alas, even the best recipes don't work every time and 'No Strings Attached' is really too close and too soft to push any boundaries. And don't get me started with the actors'performance, except for Kevin Kline they're all extraordinarily...unremarkable. Kind of like a bad episode of Ally McBeal, you know the kind, with the little girl and the plumber... So, I did not enjoy 'No Strings Attached' even though I certainly can understand those who are too young to have witnessed the genre's evolution might find enjoyable in it. I guess I'm just too old and wise to fall in such an obvious trap.",3,6,7,23 March 2011
