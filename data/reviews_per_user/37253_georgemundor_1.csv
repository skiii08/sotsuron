Despicable Me 2," You have to watch it if you love minions!
","Lots of light scenes from the stupidity of Gru's minions. Lots of cuteness from the girls (Margo, Edith and Agnes).But the story is very predictable. The drama is not too strong, there are some tense from the action scenes, but not much, not enough to brought people's tense expression.This movie will instantly bored you when you don't see minions or the girls on the scene.I am saying that this film is very funny, cute, hilarious, but not good enough as a drama. If you haven't watch this movie, you can't hope too much from it's story, but you'll laugh pretty hard as you see the minions, and you'll be amazed from the cuteness of the girls.",5,5,11,4 July 2013
