The New World," A Brave and Powerful Film
","Something happened in the 80's. There was a defining moment that systematically changed how people look at the world. I didn't know it then but when my teachers told me of the first Thanksgiving and the story of Indians and Pilgrims living together in a peace in harmony little did I discover that it was all a lie. By the time I got out of Elementary school I heard the heartbreaking story of how the white man killed every last Native American with extreme malice. So what was the truth, who was at fault? It was only after years of figuring out just how history works that I came to the conclusion that (for the most part) History is rarely black and white and the monsters and heroes that have become part of the story are rarely as monstrous or heroic as they seem.That's what makes Terence Malick's THE NEW WORLD so bold. It doesn't try to tell a story about America, but he tells a story of two people trapped between themselves and the world that continues to change around them. You will find little here about how horrible Europeans are or how savage the Native Americans are, instead you get a lyrical poem about the simple curiosity that must have come over the Native Americans and European Settlers at the birth of America.THE NEW WORLD begins just as America does at the dawn of the Jamestown Colony. Its 1607 and two ship has dropped off the men who will successfully settle the land. Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) is sent to the local Native Tribe to make friends and alliances for their very survival. He meets and falls for Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) who asks her father the king to spare Smith's life. On Pocahontas' instance the King helps the men of the Jamestown settlement survive their first winter, but disowns his daughter after he realizes these men are not leaving.Terrence Malick has crafted a beautiful film. The score is lush, the photography beautiful, and the performances are just golden. At the heart of this film is a simple (and yet dramatically complicated) love story. I could have been set anywhere, in fact hundreds of films have dealt with the theme. But Malick gives us characters worth rooting for and embracing and a story that is told simply and beautiful.Q'Orianka Kilcher embodies Pocahantas with such a sweet demeanor and striking curiosity. She is strong, and joyful, and seems unfazed by the world around her. I loved the scenes when she goes to England. Somehow her performance, which was so raw and passionate, made me believe she had never seen Western Civilization before. She is the lynch pin to this film and somehow carries it with an amount of courage and yet a simple aloofness. She makes acting look easy.Malick also wisely doesn't pull the story down by cluttering it with dread, or political correctness. Some will probably argue that the film turns a blind eye to the suffering cause by 17th Century Colonialism. But that's not what this film is about. THE NEW WORLD is about a girl, who becomes a women at a time when the world was changing.The film is also about groups of people exploring each other for the first time. The Settlers and the Native people don't have histories baggage to hold them back. They are simple men and women trying to figure out who these strange people are that have moved into their neighborhood. It's amazing to watch, the outcome of this history can and will be discussed for years and years. But THE NEW WORLD is not that forum.I have my qualms with the end of the film. The story could have been a little stronger, but because the characters have so much heart and the film is so beautiful I didn't mind. At the end of the day plot developments are pointless, when you have Characters with heart and power. THE NEW WORLD is a film worth watching, and embracing. It's a strong character driven tale that is both bold and daring simply because it chooses heart over politics",9,8,17,20 January 2006
Walk the Line," Who Was Johnny Cash?
","There is a moment in the new Johnny Cash Biopic WALK THE LINE that is so true and honest it stuck with me throughout the whole film. It's a moment that most people will forget, others will scoff and probably say 'look at that close-minded Bible-Thumper.' But I'll carry that moment with me for a long time. Judith Carter (Reese Witherspoon) is walking around a small five and dime. A former Southern Gospel Child star she has just gone through a horrible divorce. An old sweet women walks up to her and compliments her parents as being great Christians. After Carter thanks her for the sentiment. The old women spews the line 'Divorce is an abomination' thus killing Judith with her down-home Christian Charm and in the process putting good ole James 3:9 into practical application 'With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.(James 3:9 NIV) Working in Christian Radio I have come into contact with people like this. Hey I was once even accosted by a man in a collar because he didn't like the direction the station was going (and I didn't even make the decisions about that anyway.) But I also remember how easy it is to judge someone for their mistakes. It also allows me to have great admiration for June Carter and her family cause frankly this film allows them to show so much Christian love I'm embarrassed. .....But before this review turns into a sermon allow me to tell you just what I think I of James Mangold's WALK THE LINE.There are some people that are so complex, so multi-dimensional, that to try to sum their lives up in a few hours would be impossible. Johnny Cash is that kind of person. He was a man of faith, a man of sorrow, a man fighting his demons, and a man who had a gentle simplicity. When you saw him you thought he was easily figured out. WALK THE LINE tries and sometimes succeeds. Joaquin Phoenix stars as the Man In Black, and does a good job of becoming Cash. I didn't find myself looking at him and saying here's a guy trying to be someone he's not (earlier this week I sat through CAPOTE, and thought 'wow that's a great Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing Truman Capote, {in all honesty I was so bored by Capote I fell asleep in the middle of it so that's why there is no review}). It's a good performance because Pheonix tries his hardest to keep Cash grounded. Reese Witherspoon also controls June Carter-Cash with a live vivaciousness. She fills those shoes so well she almost steals the movie away from Pheonix and that's quite okay with me.What doesn't work is a screenplay by Gill Dennis and Director James Mangold that is so difficult to nail down. It jumps from scene to scene because that's what it feels it needs to do. So while the performances are great, the film is too busy trying to play out events, instead of getting to the heart of the matter: WHO WAS JOHNNY CASH?. It gives us scenes with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and The Man in Black's troubles with drugs, but sometimes forgets that this is a film about a man. It's too pre-occupied with being a bio-pic and not about getting to the heart of the matter: WHO IS JOHNNY CASH? Why must bio-pics be so conservative? Why must we sit through another film about another celebrity that is too busy telling a story to care about the lead characters? (This was the problem with RAY last year. Again a film with great performances, but too preoccupied with getting the viewer from one momentous career moment to the other and not nailing done who RAY CHARLES, really was.) Johnny and June Cater Cash are people with lives far more interesting than this movie.But then there is the music. T Bone Burnett has done it again. He captured the sound of the times. He nails down Cash's music quite nicely. If there is man out there batting a thousand producing soundtracks it's Burnett. From his work on the groundbreaking 'O Brother Where Art Thou' to 'Cold Mountian' he makes the music a character in the film. Trying to nail down Cash's music is a monumental challenge because of its rich diversity, but Burnett seems up to the task. I just wonder why he chose to use Phoenix and Witherspoon's voice and not the CASH recordings themselves.I also liked director Mangold's attention to detail. He has captured a changing America not with the turbulent events but with background details. This is a film about Cash, and I'm glad that he captured it that way. Many films take try to hard to pull us into the time period by saying 'alright here's the sixties cut to a group of hippies protesting Vietnam.' WALK THE LINE grounds itself by not making statements about society but by showing us Cash. Then the film eventually ends with a pointless happily ever after moment that steals something from the films final analysis. It feels forced, and leaves us at a place that is too nice and peaceful. It felt like I was watching the end of Leave it to Beaver. Sheer badly paced schmaltz. I wished with film could have ended somewhere else. WALK THE LINE is a fine bio-pic, it has some brilliant acting. But it could have been so much better, CASH was larger than life and WALK THE LINE is too busy immortalizing Cash to let us know him. It's funny that, the small moment with June Cater and the old women struck me so much. It was the moment that felt honest? Who was Johnny Cash? WALK THE LINE doesn't really tell us.",6,3,9,19 November 2005
United 93," a film about big events in life and how you very rarely hear a sound
","Where was I on September 11, 2001? Where was I as America was under attack? I was sleeping. I got a frantic call from my big sister, and when I turned on the TV to see what happened all I got was static. I lived eight miles away from ground zero and I felt cut off from the world. As I finally found a channel on the TV that worked I saw the Twin Towers fall on live. I didn't hear any explosions, I just saw a picture of two giant buildings falling. I saw smoke rise as I drove to work later that afternoon. The world had forever changed, but except for the pictures of anguish and shots of buildings falling down I heard no explosive sounds from my vantage point. Do you remember a sound? Except if you were in lower Manhattan probably not.UNITED 93 is a film about an isolated moment in the middle of extreme chaos. It's about mundane people living their mundane lives thrust into the most horrifying event in modern history. It's a film about what a true hero is. It's about evil men whose true cowardice united ordinary people. But on a deeper level it's a film about big events in life and how you very rarely hear a sound.On September 11th 2001, four planes were hijacked. Two hit the World Trade Center, and one hit the Pentagon. The last plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. That plane was UNITED 93, to some it could have looked like a footnote to that horrible day. But it became a symbol, because ordinary men and women took back the plane and gave their lives to save lives on the ground. Greenglass puts us right in the middle of this life and death drama. We meet the hijackers, we meet the flight crew, and we meet the passengers. We don't get to know them, but in real life do you really know who's sitting next to you? The film watches as people get ready for takeoff, as tower officials look at the skies on computer monitors. We check in with the FAA, the military, and we see that on September 11th life was pretty normal. Then we watch helplessly as every one of these people is thrown into a tailspin when a plane disappears off a computer monitor. We watch as a tiny green blip just disappears. That flight hit the North Tower and it had just begun.What Greenglass wisely does is not focus on the carnage. We don't even see the first plane hit the World Trade Center, and when the second one finally does there is not a big explosion. We see it on a TV, with the CNN ticker tape moving slowly by. We see smoke, but we see no carnage. Only Silence. In a more conventional film we would probably see every explosion, but even as United 93 hits the ground we hear nothing, only silence. Because for the most part things only blow up in the movies.This device works well. It makes UNITED 93 feel real. The people feel real. The action feels real. I liken it to watching a home movie. United 93 is so simple and effective I almost looked for the time and date stamps in the corner of the screen. It's natural and raw. That's why it is so effective and that's why it needed to be made now.September 11th's history is still being written. As we get further and further from it a romantic version of these events will begin to unfold. You want proof check out a World War II film made in the 40's and compare it to PEARL HARBOR. UNITED 93 is a film that's effectiveness will be felt 50 years from now when that generations Michael Bay decides to make a silly film about a girl and a guy who find love on the 65 floor of the trade center as they fall. But in the here and now UNITED 93 will stand as a record of Hero's who saved the day, of the confusion that overtook us all, and of the raw power of real life.",9,5,10,1 May 2006
Monster," Gripping and Tragic
","I sometimes wonder why more people can't be nice.  I wonder why the sins of the father have to plague the lives of his children.  Why people rape, abuse, hurt, and maim.  In a perfect world everyone would be happy.  In a perfect world no one would ever want.  In a perfect world a women like Aileen Wurnos would not have been sentenced to die on death row, and in a real world I wouldn't have to write about a movie like MONSTER.  It's a movie that drips with exceptional performances, and yet leaves your soul so cold to the core.MONSTER is the tragic true story of a woman who longed for a friend, and nobody came to her aid.  It stars Charlize Theron (The Devil's Advocate) as Aileen Wurnos, one of the first women to ever die on death row.  Of course the film doesn't begin that way, when we first meet her she's sitting in the rain with a gun contemplating ending it all.  You see she's has no future. She has nothing but a past that's not worth repeating, and all she has in the world is in a storage locker. What little money she has, is gained by being a prostitute.  But one day in a little bar in Daytona Beach, Florida she meets and falls for a woman that finally makes her happy.The woman is named Selby (Christina Ricci, The Opposite of Sex), and she's a young lesbian just trying to figure out the world for herself.  At first this relationship puts Aileen on cloud nine.  She's willing to do anything to provide for the first person that ever loved her.But one night when Aileen kills a john who gets a little to rough, a series of events take our characters on a one way trip with destiny. Leaving the landscape of these two women's lives are forever changed.  If only someone had just been nice to Aileen.MONSTER is not a happy film.  It's one of those movies that leaves you dead at the end.  You lose faith in humanity; you lose faith in yourself.  I like these kinds of movies, cause they convict me.  Here I am a young guy who sometimes gets ticked off at a driver in front of me on the road.  For one split moment I have murderous anger when that guy cuts me off.  What if I was in Aileen's situation?  Would I do the same thing?  I would hope not, but hey you never know.If there is one performance that will tear you up inside this year, it's Theron's.  For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is, in real life, a beautiful women.  Theron throws all the glamour out the window, gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly.  This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing.  She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance, but Theron was Aileen. This is some brilliant acting.I also give Kudos to Bruce Dern .  His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen.  While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture.The screenplay by Patty Jenkins (Who also directed) does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life.  What Aileen did was reprehensible. What she did was evil, and she must pay for that.  But it allows for sympathy. Not all evil is dark and black, and not all people who murder are 100% culpable.  But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past.
MONSTER is a well-made, brilliantly acted film that's not for the weak of heart.  It's engaging, engrossing, and realistic.  I think I want to rush out and get the silliest comedy I can find right now, because I need something to offset the dark tone of this film.  While it get a fine recommendation, I just hope that the next time you feel like treating someone like crap, you'll remember just how tragic the life of Aileen Wurnos turned tragic because nobody reached out.",Null,111,147,19 January 2004
Underworld," Like The Apendix to an Epic Novel!!
","Have you ever read the appendix of an epic novel?  You know the pages near the back of a classic novel like DUNE or LORD OF THE RINGS where a lot of extra information lies.  It let's you in on a thing that happened before the story and tells of kings and queen who ruled the area before the action of the actual story take place.   The new film UNDERWORLD plays like the appendix of a novel.  There's lots of extra information and yet very little substance in and of itself.UNDERWORLD tells the story of Selene (Kate Beckensale, Pearl Harbor), a vampire, and Michael (Scott Speedman, Duets) a human being chased by the vampire's sworn enemies, a band of Werewolves. Selene job in her vampire clan is to kill said Werewolves, she's known as a death eater.  You see there is a war brewing between the werewolves and the vampires.  It's kind of an undead Hatfield and McCoy story.  Or is it? UNDERWORLD suffers from an intriguing concept and little substance.  There is this huge back-story, that finds its way into the movie and I bet it's figured out pretty concisely.  There talk of history, and legend, and generations of vampire's and werewolves.  But that's all. Compelling characters take a back seat, to loud and almost obnoxious action sequences and subplots running left and right with nowhere to go.In fact the only reason the film focuses on Beckensale is because she's the big name star.  She comes and goes at the whim of the screenplay.  In fact I think there was a 20-minute segment near the end that she isn't even in. The major plot of this film plays like an overlong subplot in a much more epic film or maybe even a two-part episode of a fantasy television series. 
In fact that's the only way a film like Underworld can work.  The film is crying out for some focus.  There's a story dying to come out.  It's right there on the surface, and instead of focusing on Selene and her fight to save Michael.  It is bogged down by this silly and overdeveloped history of the war between vampire's and werewolves.  You know what.  This movie would make a great television or comic book series.  It just doesn't work as a stand-alone film.And yet I can't say I hated UNDERWORLD.  It looks too good.  Its visual style lies somewhere between BATMAN and MINORITY REPORT.  It's set in one of those futuristic cities that are dirty and disgusting, and full of horror. A city where the sun never shines and humans are food for the children of the night.  If you like really neat eye candy this is the film for you.It seems like the filmmakers took the lets see how much cool stuff we can jam into the film approach, and most of it works on a purely surface level. It's only after you realize that if you removed most of the cool scenes you'd have nothing worth watching and that's when the Action sequences begin to grate on you.I longed for a much better, more fully realized picture than I got with UNDERWORLD.  I wanted cool action sequences, but I also wanted some compelling characters and interesting story developments.  All of which fall flat under the weight of an unfocused and overly melodramatic story.  Do yourself a favor and skip UNDERWORLD.  But as consolation may I suggest you give EQUILBRIUM a try?**1/2 out of 5",Null,0,0,23 September 2003
Shaun of the Dead," A Funny Romantic Comedy
","Listen I know how it is. Sometimes when you go out to the movies you wanna laugh. Sometimes you wanna watch two nice people fall in love, and if you're like me you wanna watch zombies rip people apart. But sometimes when you go to the movies don't you just long to see a romantic comedy in which Zombies rip people apart? Fear not reader, SHAUN OF THE DEAD is the film for you.SHAUN OF THE DEAD follows our hero Shaun (Simon Pegg, 24 Hour Party People) on journey to win back his girl Liz (Lucy Davis, TV's The Office), make amends with his Mom (Nicola Cunningham), and to fight off a small London Suburb of Zombies. Shaun enlists the help of his slacker best friend Ed (Nick Frost, TV's SPACED), and Dianne (Lucy Davis, TV's The Office) and David (Dylan Moran, Notting Hill) Liz's two best friends, who don't seem to like Shaun Very Much, but they follow him anyway cause Liz follows Shaun. It's all very complicated but once you let the characters take hold, this film is a trip.Director Edgar Wright (TV's Spaced) has crafted a silly and yet surprisingly rich film. Full of characters worth rooting for, gore that harkens back to a simpler time when it was okay to disembowel in horror flicks, and conflicts that enlighten our characters with humanity. It's a film about how mundane and Zombie-like our lives are, and about our search for that hero inside. But more importantly the film is about being funny. Laugh out loud, gutt-busting, funny.Pegg's Shaun hits the right chords as a guy who wants more out of his life, but is drawn back into his slacker existence because he doesn't know any better. He's every Tom, Dick, and Harry who looks at themselves 10 years after graduating from college and wondering, 'how did I get here?' That's easy he's been sticking up for a buddy who has as much drive as a broken down Ford Pinto and that's what makes him a great hero, he's empathetic to a fault.But most are probably wondering what about the Zombies. SHAUN OF THE DEAD works because the screenplay loves the material. As screenwriter's as well,Pegg and Wright don't allow the material to become mean spirited. They love the Zombie movie. I'll bet they sat up many late nights watching NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD over and over. There's even a small wink at 28 DAYS LATER won't fall on deaf ears. They know the material well and walk the thin line between spoof and homage, to a nice degree.The best scene in the film concerns one characters death, by being bitten by a Zombie. Nobody wants to shoot that character (who will eventually become one of the undead) and they're torn on both sides. A showdown of broken bottles and a corkscrew, tests the characters will, and in the end brings them closer together. The scene works because there is real tension. Although this is a comedy, these characters are in peril. It was exhilarating.The film's only major flaw is that it takes far too long to get started. The first twenty minutes drag on like they were being paid by the minute. The laughs at the beginning seemed to be forced and if I'd left before the Zombies begin to show up I might have panned the movie as boring. But once the Zombies show up the film comes to life with really good laughs, and even a few good scares chucked in for measure. SHAUN OF THE DEAD would have done well to have had the early moments of the film re-imagined or shaved a little. But I'll forgive the film this one small flaw. I really liked it.At the end of the day though the most surprising thing about SHAUN OF THE DEAD is what its not. It's not a Horror film. It's a Romantic Comedy, turned on its head and it works almost flawlessly. In fact my wife called it 'FORCES OF NATURE with Zombies (instead of weather).' I don't know if I'd go that far but I will agree that there is a little romance for the lady in your life. If you're looking for something a little different, if you're looking for a silly movie with heart, or you like to watch people get ripped apart limb from limb. SHAUN OF THE DEAD does not disappoint, I promise you'll like it.****1/2 (out of 5)",Null,2,5,26 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," It's big, loud, and lacks subtlety, and charm. A Hollywood blockbuster for sure.
","When one attempts to create a list of the worst hack directors in Hollywood, Gore Verbinski, is in the top 3 for me (right behind Bret Ratner and Michael Bay). These men have made millions in Hollywood peddling half-hearted, and over bloated popcorn flicks for years, and have gotten very good at it. So, when the receipts start to pour in for PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MANS CHEST, Gore Verbinski will probably laugh all the way to the bank. I ask why? Why do we as humans keep going to see movie like this? Why does the entire audience hoop, holler, and cheer? And why can't I have the fun everybody else seems to be having? DEAD MAN'S Chest begins on the wedding day of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. Their nuptials are ruined when they are taken into custody for the events of the original film. Will is guaranteed freedom and release for himself and his bride but only if he will retrieve a compass from Jack Sparrow, and deliver it to the evil East Indian Trading Company. This sets off a series of events that bring Will, Elizabeth, and Captian Jack Sparrow face to face with the mysterious Davey Jones and the motley crew of the Flying Dutchman. Will there be Action? Will there be Swashbuckling Adventure? Will Johnny Depp act like a Drag Queen on a harbor cruise? Of course.I can easily sum up this film in one word: adequate. It got a lot of nicely paced action sequences, some silly comedy, and there is just the right amount of peril and suspense hiding around the corner. You won't have a bad time, if you must run out and see this movie, the theater is the place. But if you were expecting a deeper more fulfilling visit with the characters of the first film, or at least a better more fleshed out story, you'll be sadly disappointed. DEAD MAN'S CHEST is just more of the same.All the characters show up say their lines, and seem to be having a good time. But there's nothing else there. Orlando Bloom is the hero, Keira Knightly is the Damsel with bite, and Johnny Depp is Johnny Depp pretending to be Keith Richards as a pirate. The screenplay does nothing to let us into their lives, their motivations serve the script only, and while they don't do a bad job, the script doesn't really ask them too. This is a point A to point B kind of a movie, every motivation serves the screenplay, not the story.As for the action scenes. There are two worth mentioning and save the film from being utterly boring. The first is an elaborate chase scene on an island with swinging cages, angry natives, and Jack Sparrow tied to a giant bamboo pole. The other scene involves a waterwheel and a ton of swashbuckling. This scene comes late enough into the movie that it almost saves the entire picture. The last fifteen minutes are a breeze because that scene really creates a lot of momentum.Director Verbinski show again that he can take pretty pictures, and stage large special effects sequences. But very little of it is groundbreaking or worth writing home about. He doesn't up the ante at all. Great sequels ask us to take the next step, to challenge what came before, or a least given the characters more depth and freshness. DEAD MAN'S CHEST is simply a two and half hour rehash of the original PIRATES film, with a less interesting villain and some anti-capitalist nonsense thrown in.The film also suffers from a running time that is just unacceptable. Like the first PIRATES film, DEAD MAN'S CHEST is a 90 minute movie stretched over two and a half hours. So much happens in this film, and so much of it is inconsequential to the plot. Because the plot in and of itself lacks any meat. This film is the middle of a planned trilogy, and since it has very few surprises, character depth, and plot revelations that I just know the third installment will be very, very lackluster.I understand that people like these kind of movies. I don't because I know that there are so many talented people out there with awesome stories to tell, and character to create. DEAD MAN'S CHEST is just a rehash of the same thing. It's big, loud, and lacks subtlety, and charm. A Hollywood blockbuster for sure. It's adequate, people will like it, but this is not a great film.",5,5,9,8 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Breathtaking (after a weak first act)
","There is one scene in Andrew Adamson's new film THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, that for me walking into the theater that needed to be perfect. If not the whole movie and (the continued franchise of sequels) would fall flat on its face. If the film did not capture this scene I believe the heart and soul of C.S. Lewis and his magical world would have been completely destroyed.But I digress! Walking into Narnia is an interesting experience for me. In all honesty I find C.S. Lewis to be a great writer that I can hardly read. His books are hailed left and right and I just can't read them. It's not Lewis's fault. I realize it's my own media saturated thick head that blocks me up. So a few weeks ago after a screening of a 10 minute super trailer for NARNIA I decided to dust off my old copy of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and decided to give it a chance. I read the first two books in about a week and I wondered to myself. What was my problem? What took me so long to become enchanted by this mystical world? I've come to realize I cannot appreciate the classics. I really think that's my loss and something I intend to work on in the new year.So anyway, sitting down in the movie theater I psyched myself up I intended to be wowed. I wanted Narnia to come alive on screen like it did in my mind and I think it fell a little short of my expectations but in the end made me smile.NARNIA tells the story of four children. When the youngest named Lucy (Georgie Henley) finds a magic wardrobe that transports her into the magical land of Narnia. Narnia is a land of talking animals, magical fauns, and the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton) whose enslaved the land causing it to be forever winter and never Christmas. Her sister Susan (Anna Popplewell), and brothers Peter (William Moseley), and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) don't believe her story. Until the day all the children enter the Land of Narnia. A land and get caught up in a war that may fulfill a prophecy that will bring peace to Narnia.NARNIA is a fascinating example of a film that doesn't exactly add up but in the end is satisfying. The screenplay is riddled with the problems from the very beginning. It tries so hard to stick to the book that the early moments of the film feel flat. Even when the children get to Narnia you feel the same way. Narnia feels just like the British Country side the children have come from. Narnia should feel different and it doesn't. Why is their a light post growing in the middle of the forest? Why are the animals talking? Why is it always winter and yet never Christmas? These questions should inspire awe. NARNIA should glow and jump off the screen, but the first act is to busy getting from point a to point b than to allow us to immerse ourselves in the NARNIAN landscape. If your like me you'll find yourself thinking 'why does this feel like a third rate LORD OF THE RINGS?' I think what's missing is the thing that made the novel so enchanting. It's Lewis's self aware narration. Even when at the greatest peril it was Lewis's kind words and silly aside comments that lightened the situation. Admittedly that would be difficult in a film but It would have been nice if they'd tried. Instead they stuck humor in places that seemed out of place.But fear not, all is not lost. Because if you can get through the first hour (which really isn't that bad). You'll come out on the other side and into a much better and powerful movie. Once Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) the Mighty Lion comes on the screen you're in for the ride of your life.I mentioned earlier there is one scene that needed to be perfect or the film would be destroyed. That scene involves Aslan and the stone table. They got it right, and oh boy was I impressed. If Aslan is not strong, if Aslan is not seen as a threat even as he is being tormented this scene falls apart. But Adamson and his team make Aslan a character to be reckoned with. If you don't gasp as Aslan climbs those stairs and the beasts and the White Witch part the way for him, if you don't feel the pain and anguish of Aslan's torment, and if your tear ducts don't well up when the scene is over, I would doubt your humanity ( just a little.) After that the film only gets better, there is an awesome battle sequence, and even Narnia begins to take a life of its own. It gives each character their moment to shine and it wraps itself up neatly enough. After the film was over I can't wait for PRINCE CASPIAN (or THE HORSE AND HIS BOY) to hit the big screen.I would also like to single out little Georgie Henley (watch out Dakota Fanning) the little girl who plays Lucy. She gives the early part of the film a lot more life and fills the screen like very few child actors can. This little girl (in her debut role) has an innocence and yet a maturity that belies her age. This little girl gives a performance that should really net her an Oscar nod. It probably won't but if I didn't bring it up who would? While this film has a few rough spots and a first act that needed some work THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, and THE WARDROBE is an enchanting journey that is worth the price of admission.

Finding Nemo," Passafist Reviews Finding Nemo
","In the age-old battle between what's important in film, plot or character? I'm convinced character is king.  Nothing makes this idea truer than a film like Pixar's FINDING NEMO.  A delightful new animated comedy from those guys that brought you Toy Story.Sure there's a plot; it's about a father fish searching for his son fish. Many films operate on this premise.  In fact even PIXAR's TOY STORY 2, borrows this premise. (For those who don't know TOY STORY 2's main plot is about a toy being stolen by evil toy man, and how his friends try to save him.)  But like the above film FINDING NEMO is really about the colorful characters our hero encounters.Albert Brooks (The Muse) voices and is Marlin.  His performance could be compared to Woody Allen, who voiced himself in the film ANTZ.  Like Allen this film plays with his film persona, his neurotic tendencies. The minute you see him you buy it.  If Albert Brooks were a Clown Fish this is exactly how he'd look and act.Ellen Degeneres (Mr. Wrong) voices Dory, and for once she's funny. (Yes, Ellen when you drop the gay jokes and just act funny, you actually have a shot at being entertaining.)  She has some really great sequences in this film; my favorite was her talking to a blue whale.  Dory also has some short-term memory loss.  I kept thinking to myself, so if Memento was comedy about fish, this is probably what it would look like. 
My favorite performance is William Dafoe (Auto-Focus) as Gill.  I liked how the animators used Dafoe's face as the model for Gill's deformity. The details are astounding.  His performance is electric.  He plays the leader of the fish tank with such power, I wished he was my leader.  But Alas, I am not a computer-animated fish.  Oh well.The film looks amazing.  Directors Andrew Stanton (A Bug's Life) and Lee Unkrich (Monster's Inc) do an amazing job of creating a world under the sea. If you allow yourself the time to immerse yourself in it, you'll be transformed.  It's some of the best digitally rendered computer animation I've ever seen.  It exists in realm somewhere between what's real and what's pure fantasy.  That's the kind of place all computer-animated worlds should lay.So here it is a great film.  A film that fills a paper-thin plot with characters you laugh with, cry with, and want to be with.  There are vegetarian sharks, lobsters with New England accents, and California surfer turtles, if any of this sounds interesting this is the kind of film for you.So Swim, don't walk to see.FINDING NEMO.",Null,0,0,15 June 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Conventional Tripe!!
","Thank God for beautiful women. I especially thank God for my fiancÃ©. It's just too darn bad she has such conventional taste in movies. So of course I have gotten very used to the occasional chick flick. They make her laugh, even if I don't get it or care too. They fill her with glee but they fill me with loathing. But every once and while a chick flick comes along that is so conventional, and so silly. That I'm am filled with Apathy instead of loathing. So I guess that's the only way to describe HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN TEN DAYS: a conventional film that filled with apathy.Like every romantic comedy 10 DAYS tells the story of two beautiful people and how they get to know each other, falling in and out of love with each other, and then telling there less attractive friends about how happy they are. In this film those two people are Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson, Almost Famous) and Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughy, EDTV), they are so adorable their first names have that same first letter as their last name (they might want to shoot their parents). They each meet under dubious circumstances, she has to write and article about the mistakes women make while dating, and he has to make her fall in love with him to win an advertising account. So of course in the process they both fall in love and wild comedic scenes take place.What works in the film are Hudson and McConaughy, they have really nice chemistry together. They have a really sweet conversation when they first meet. It is constructed with just pithy little statements, and it is both silly and charming. Hudson also relishes torturing McConaughy with her silly dating games. The scene in which she breaks up the boy's poker game really enchanted me. Not a terribly inspired scene but it has a really nice comedic tone. So at least it worked for me.I also liked the scene at Ben's parent's house. The game of B.S. was inspired. This scene works because for once the colorful family doesn't act like buffoons. This scene is also much too good for this movie.I just hated that the film was so conventional. In the course of an hour and forty minutes, they meet, fall in love, fall out of love, and realize they both really love each other and live happily ever after. Its plot is constructed out of every romantic comedy cliche ever made.
What also bothered me was that our two star-crossed lovers are far to good for the material. The concept would work without sitcom jokes and witty one liners; but of course in Hollywood unconventional ... If you are looking for a good night out with your lady friend, 10 DAYS will make her smile. But may I recommend a better romantic comedy, Benny and Joon. It's just a suggestion.",Null,3,6,30 September 2003
The Polar Express," High Art Aimed at a Young Audience
","Christmas time is here. It's a time of Joy and maybe even a little pain. It's that special time every year I give the cynic in me a little time off. It's also the time I let myself get pulled into the movies of the season. I'm not talking about the fodder for Oscar that permeate this time, or the stupid little comedies created to play off these high class art. I'm talking about those movies about Christmas, the really engage and audience. Films like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, A Christmas STORY, MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, or MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS. Films that on the surface are a little schmaltzy and silly, but have so much heart I can't stand to be pulled in.THE POLAR EXPRESS follows the adventure of a young boy whom has lost his faith in Santa. He muses the question any growing boy would ask 'Does Santa exist?' When a mysterious train appears on his front lawn on Christmas Eve it whisks him away on an adventure that could take him to meet the big man himself. Was it a dream? Does Santa really exist? All these question will be answered in 90 minutes Christmas has a new movie: THE POLAR EXPRESS. A film so sweet, and breathtaking it's hard as a critic to shower it with negatives. Of course I could I could tell you there are moments when the films momentum screeches to a halt, the ending goes on forever, and the tone of the movie is a little to sweet for its own good. I also thought the needless cameo by Steven Tyler completely dragged me out of the film. 'Oh look it's the guy from Areosmith,' I mused. It took me out of the film for a moment because I thought I was in a much cheaper film. But I will not acknowledge those small trifles anymore.This film is breathtaking. It's one fueled entirely by imagination. The new computer imaging effects do a great job of conveying a magical aura, without drawing us into reality. I don't believe we'll ever get to the point where a computer generated person will look human, (and that's just fine with me.) Had the creator's of the Polar Express tried to do that it would have destroyed the look of the film. But the characters odd movements, and almost human emotions strike the right chords. I loved the dancing chef's And waiter's sequence on THE POLAR EXPRESS. It was silly and so full of life. I wondered if they had tried to shoot this film in live action (without green screens and body suits) what would this sequence look like. My thought: Bad Broadway. But the CGI characters could fly through the air, do difficult physical stunts and all without the scene feeling choppy. This is the first big sequence and it sets you up for the even more amazing wonders to come.The Polar Express also takes us on an adventure in speed over and icy lake, down the steepest hill imaginable, and introduces us to characters that are both vibrant and fun. Tom Hanks fills at least 5 roles, and gives each one their own aura. I especially loved the vagrant Hurdy Gurdy man whom appears and disappears to help out the young hero. The scene on ski's I really don't want to ruin it for you.THE POLAR EXPRESS is high art aimed at a young audience. If you have a heart of stone, I wouldn't recommend you waste your money here. But if you like to be whisked away to far off lands, if you have a place in your heart for Christmas, give THE POLAR EXPRESS a try. It's so much fun.",8,2,4,26 January 2006
Nacho Libre," if you like weirdly sweet Mexican wrestling comedies this is the film for you
","It's good to know that farce is alive and well in the world. Since the mid 90's it feels like film makers have lost their grip on truly great weird comedy. Movies that speak to the few and turn off the rest. It seems that even as the tools to unlock our imaginations get flashier and flashier, and special effect budgets grow and grown, American film grow static and stale. Then when it seems like all hope is lost, a film like NACHO LIBRE comes along.Somewhere in Mexico, a young priest named Nacho (Jack Black) longs to be recognized. He's tired of serving the same bland food to the young boys in his charge. He's tired of being disrespected by the other priests. He longs to be a luchadore (a Mexican wrestler), and to gain the affections of the stunning Sister EncarnaciÃ³n (Ana del la Regura). Then when all hope is lost he teams up with a new friend named Esquelta, and takes the Mexican wrestling world by storm. Will the orphan boys get better food? Will Nacho win the heart of Sister EncarnaciÃ³n? Will he lose everything he has, on a quest to become a great warrior? Giving this movie its due will provide those answers and more. The movie not perfect. It's a little overlong and some of the jokes fall flat on their face. But there is an earnestness and a sweet gentility in the film that will win you over. You cannot enter this movie with the wrong attitude and if you don't like weird movie its not for you. But if you let it entertain you and if you give into the fact that it really bizarre, it will work. You have to take every scene with grain of salt and logic must be thrown out the window. But if you turn off that part of your brain that strives for everything to be plausible, than this film will entertain.Then for no apparent reason the movie does something I didn't quite expect, it begins to tackle a serious subject. Behind all the silliness is a story about how legalism traps us in a place of boredom and predictability. Whether it be religious legalism or secular legalism, NACHO LIBRE is about a misfit who succeeds because he goes out on a limb. He doesn't give up his religious fervor when the chips are down, when his atheist friend tells him to give into science and logic, and he doesn't give up on God because men of cloth treat him badly. He stays true to his faith and not his religion. This message is not beaten over the audiences head. This is not a religious picture. But it gives the film a dimension that I didn't expect.Director Jared Hess, doesn't stray to far from his Napoleon Dynamite roots. But that's okay. It works here and he hits the right comic tones. I can't wait for the DVD because I'm convinced that the film really needs to be viewed a second time. Knowing what to expect allows the audience to settle into Hess skewed comedy. The film is very dry and if you don't know what to expect its easy to dismiss the comedy and think the film is horrible. You have to work at it a little bit and let it sink in. But when you get it you'll love it.If you're looking for an hour and half of silliness you can't go wrong with NACHO LIBRE. It's cute, sweet, and you get to stare at Jack Black's upper torso for far too long. Trust me if you like weirdly sweet Mexican wrestling comedies this is the film for you.",7,82,114,23 June 2006
Lost in Translation," A Great Movie, Trapped in a Good Film
","Have you ever sat through a movie that is really good, has a compelling story, great characters, and yet still felt a little cold?  I mean you really liked the movie, it made you think, it didn't play down to you, and yet you were hoping for little bit more?  Sophia Coppola's new film LOST IN TRANSLATION, is a good movie with a great movie caught inside it.TRANSLATION stars Bill Murray (Groundhog Day) as Bob Harris, a former hotshot action star at the end of his career.   His marriage may be falling apart, his life is coming unraveled, and he's just been offered two million dollars to hawk an alcoholic beverage in Japan.  Life seems to be getting worse until he strikes up a relationship with an unlikely friend.Her name is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, The Man Who Wasn't There) and she just so happens to be in the same boat.  Her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi, The Other Sister) is living a dream and ignoring her.  She's alone in a city of millions.  TRANSLATION is so rich with ideas.  Here you're presented with two people who are alone forced to cling to each other for lack of anyone else.  In America would these two friends ever find each other?  Probably not, but here they are strangers in a strange land and all that makes a difference.Bill Murray once again takes the smart road and distances himself from the films that made him a star.  He plays a character of such stunning vulnerability and yet silly charm.   I loved how he disappears into a scene. You forget you're looking at the guy from MEATBALLS.  I sometimes miss the silly and crazy actor he once was, but at least when he turns in a dramatic performance it's well worth watching.Johansson should also be congratulated for her fine performance.  I liked her understated charm and silly little smile.  The camera loves to linger on her because she's got this unique screen presence.  Of course she's beautiful, but not as a typical actress is beautiful.  She's beautiful like that girl in you're high school homeroom is beautiful, or that random women on the street is beautiful.  Johansson can exist in the real world.  She's average and yet mysterious, cute and yet understated. All that aside the biggest problem with the movie is that much of the plot is half realized.  To make up for this Coppola trains her camera on Johansson as she a stare out windows, lays in bed, takes walk around Tokyo and then stares out the widow again.  A little of this is okay; it even worked sometimes.  I gave us a look inside her head.  But after we've figured out that she's lonely we keep watching her look out windows, and walk around.  It was too much and prolonged the meat of the movie, the relationship between her and Bob.To the films credit there is a great sequence in which Bob and Charlotte are laying together in a bed.  You can tell they have a connection that sparks are flying, in a Hollywood movie this is the point that they'd begin to kiss.  But in this film Bob does something far more interesting he just touches her foot.  In real life you have to face the ones you love in the morning, Best not throw it all away on a person you hardly know.TRANSLATION is about what connects people.  Is it a love story? Is it a story about friendship?  Is it a story about fidelity?  Is it about following your heart?  Yes and no, and maybe so.  What's here is a compelling piece of filmmaking that dares you to do something we, as causal moviegoers, are seldom allowed to do.  It dares us to think.

Fargo," Passafist Reviews Fargo
","The Following is the 2nd in a series titled Passafist: The Great FilmsThe crime in the Coen Brother's film FARGO has to have been the worst executed crime in the history of cinema.  It's flawed from the very beginning.  It's a good thing that the movie isn't the same way; it's possibly one of the best-executed films of the last 25 years.
I've always been a sucker for strong character dramas.  Plot is inconsequential to me for the most part. I always look at it as that added bonus if a plot really grabs me.  I just realize that most stories operate on the same seven or eight premises.  So it is the characters that save them.  FARGO is full of great characters.The film opens in Fargo, North Dakota, at a shady trucker bar.  Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macey, Panic) is there to meet Carl (Steve Buscemi, Con Air) --a low rent, funny looking crook.  Carl is there with another man named Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare, The Big Lebowski), a tall, silent and scary looking crook.  Jerry drops off a car and sets a crime into motion. The two crooks are to kidnap Jerry's wife (Kristen Rudrud, Pleasantville) and hold her for ransom.  Jerry is trying to embezzle money from his well-to-do father in law Wade (Harve Presnell, Face/Off), who is a real jackass. Needless to say, what should be a simple crime goes terribly wrong.  When three people show up dead in a small town called Brainerd, the local sheriff, Marge Gunderson (Francis McDormand, The Man Who Wasn't There) get on the case.What Joel and Ethan Coen have crafted here is a drama of such life and scope.  It's not simply about a crime.  It's about people living their lives at a moment in time.  There are scenes in this film that are unnecessary to the plot that are completely necessary for these characters.Take for instance, the intimate scene in a hotel resturant in Fargo.  Marge is met by an old high school chum, named Mike Yanagita, (Steve Park, and TOYS).  He invites her to the hotel to seduce her.  He's so bad at it that he makes up stories to try to win her over.  She's so sympathetic, to this mans needs, but also wary of his advances.  Any other film, this scene would probably be cut, it sure doesn't move the story along.  But it paints a clearer picture of just who Marge really is; it's vital to the evolution of her character.  It's perfect.There is another brilliant sequence near the beginning of the film where Jerry has just told Wade about a great land deal he has in the works.  He's hoping Wade will give him the money.  When the meeting takes a decidedly different turn there is a single shot of Jerry walking back to his car. It's so sad. It's so heartbreaking.  You sympathize with and for Jerry. It's reminds me of that scene in TAXI DRIVER, where Travis hangs up the phone after being rejected by Betsey and the camera pans away to the empty hallway, very effective both times. Francis McDormand is perfect as Marge.  She embodies even the pregnant suit she wears through the entire film.  I don't know why Marge has to be pregnant; the film would work without her being that way.  But that again is one of those small character beats that makes FARGO a film worth watching.Another interesting device the Coen Bros. use is a small title screen at the beginning stating that the film is in fact a true story.  In all honesty it isn't.  But what that allows the film to do is work in the realm of the real.  Sure the film is a work of fiction, but still there is a feeling of authenticity that little title allows. Honestly the first time I saw FARGO, I thought it was a true story, and I believed it throughout the entirety of the film.  Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make great crooks.  In any bad film these two characters would be bumbling idiots.  Neither one is terribly smart, but there is certain finesse to there performances.  I particularly liked the early scene where Buscemi's character Carl tries to stop talking to show Stomare's Grimsrud he can play the silent game. Of course Carl can't shut up, so he winds up talking to himself.After reading this review your probably thinking this is a drama.  But the AFI listed it as one of the 100 greatest comedies.  How does that add up? Well, life is sometimes really funny; sometimes you hear a joke and you can't help laughing.  FARGO is a comedy of situation.  Marge for instance is a naturally funny person, so she'll tell a joke.  She's sweet and good hearted and so are the people she works with. So naturally funny things will happen.    FARGO is a great movie.  Well worth 95 minutes of anyone's life.  It's a slice of life comedy, set against a gritty and horrible crime.   It's a human character study.  FARGO is one of the best movies ever made.  I love FARGO.

The Matrix Revolutions," UNDERWHELMING!!!!!
","True inspiration can be spoiled by forcing ideas too hard and too fast. Inspiration can also be destroyed when it's forced at the wrong time. Sometimes ideas need to be sat on, culled over, and perfected before they are foisted on the general public. True art takes time.
In the case of THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, it has one really huge mark against it.  That is that it was shot back to back with RELOADED.  So while the brothers Wachowski were able to up the ante that they set with the original MATRIX RELOADED, REVOLUTIONS has nowhere left to go.  While this film is creative and visually stunning, it feels like a lot of the same thing. George Lucas did one thing correctly with his STAR WARS films being spaced three years apart. He was able to create new and stunning visual effects with technology that he only dreamed of with the previous films.In REVOULTIONS Neo (Keanu Reeves, The Replacements) and his `Superfriends' are back where we left them.  Fighting the endless war with the robots. You see where we last left the human race the robots were drilling into the last human city, and the dark suited Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, Babe) was running amok inside and in this installment outside of the Matrix.  As the war to save the human race commences, it's up to Neo to prove he's `THE ONE'.REVOLUTIONS can be summed in one word: UNDERWHELMING.  There is nothing new, nothing exceptionally cool, or anything of consequence going on.  In fact except for the tail end of one really neat action sequence, (that's too difficult to explain without ruining some vital plot points) the film has no suprises.In fact the first hour of the film renders the last hour of RELOADED utterly pointless, it merely ties up some loose ends and you begin to wonder why they were introduced in the first place.It also squanders Lambert Wilson's funny and sadistic Merovigian, and Monica Bellucci's Persphone.  They are in the film for mere moments.  I can only surmise that its because the Wachowski's thought it would be cool to visit them again.  This entire scene proves is how unnecessary they were in RELOADED and I liked them in that one. (As a side note this scene also includes a moment that earns this film it's R-rating.  Yes this is a PG-13 film with a moment in which a male extra grabs and tweaks a female extra's breast.  Why?  I'm not quite sure I wanna to know.)As with the other two films REVOLUTIONS has a backbone of stunning special effects.  While they look really good, they lack the creative spark that made the first MATRIX groundbreaking and it's sequel a joy to watch. REVOLUTIONS spends it time tying up the story and forgetting the tradition of not only stunning but also magical special effects.  The race to Zion sequence is the only segment that half works, and even the final showdown just kind of ends.  It should be awesome and it elicits only half the awe of the amazing final battle in the first Matrix or the breathtaking final shots of the Highway chase in RELOADED.I just wonder how much better this film could be had it been made on its own two or three years down the road.  What amazing visuals could have been created? What interesting philosophies could have been dreamed up?  What new and unusual characters could have been conjured?  We'll probably never know, and I guess I can deal with that, but I do want to.To be fair THE MATRIX REVOULTIONS is still leaps and bounds above typical action movies.  It's full of enough eye candy to keep and action junky busy for a while.  I still intend to see this film on the IMAX screen, an experience that greatly improved the last film as well.  As it stands I probably wouldn't recommend this film to a casual moviegoer, or a sci-fi enthusiast.  But for fanboys and action buffs you just might like it.

The Village," Subtext!!
","I grew up in a very conservative Christian home.  I remember hearing about how the world is slipping down a moral slope.  With prayer in school gone and the lie of `separation of church and state' permeating our society.   We as American's have lost those Judeo-Christian ideals that the founding fathers put in place.  Hence we were a fallen nation, and that's why there are so many problems in this Country.While I'm not asking anyone whose reading this to embrace these ideas, they permeate M. Knight Shyamalan's new film `The Village.'  An intriguing motion picture that asks and yet never quite answers the questions many American's are asking in this post 9/11, postmodern, and enlightened period.
THE VILLAGE is a quaint little place far from the bustling `towns' of evil and greed.  It's a 19-century prairie town, and a utopia where decent people live out their lives in peace and modest prosperity.  Money is not and issue, for the people of THE VILLAGE have no need of it.  They all speak and act like Quakers, and hold close to traditional family values. 
Of course THE VILLAGE has its own local government.  It is ruled by board of elders, who are strict but fair.  There seems to be only one rule, `Stay Out of Covington Forrest.'You see the forest is the only problem with the Village. It's full of monsters.  As long as the people stay out of the wood The Monsters leave them alone. The other problem is that The Village needs some basic drugs to save its people.  As the film opens we see the casket of a young boy who died because he did not have simple medicine's to keep him alive.  It's a scary existence but there is peace, so it might just be a trade off? Or is it?THE VILLAGE is the type of movie I personally love.  It is a film about subtext.  But what gives the film its spark is the fact that it doesn't play its message at you. But you only realize this if you give it some time and patience.  If you overlook its flaws, what you'll find is a movie that speaks to any audience.  Without being preachy and overwrought.It plays with some of the things we as American's have gotten used to in these dark times.  The color terror alert systems, false terror alarms, and presents people like you and me, people who want to go about their days without having to worry about the darkness hiding in the woods.  THE VILLAGE is a typical suburban town, if it was transplanted onto the prairie.I loved the scene with Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix, GLADIATOR) and Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard, The Grinch) as they sit on the porch in the middle of the night and preach their love to each other.  The scene is alive with energy and light.  Shyamalan frames the shot so close up, you feel like your part of the action, and the actors turn the stilted Quaker like dialogue on its head.Howard is just phenomenal.  She fills her character with color.  The other actors around her seem weighed down by the stilted dialogue, which I'll admit takes some getting used to.  Howard enchants from the very first frame and commands the audience's eyes.  Like a young Holly Hunter mixed with Julia Roberts, Bryce Howard has the potential to be the next big thing. Watch out pop a couple years from now we could have another Oscar winner in the family.The other bright spot in the film is Adrien Brody (The Pianist) he portrays Noah the town retard.  Man did he have a good time.  There is energy in his portrayal that just gushes with enthusiasm.  It looks like he's having a ball.  I'll admit there was one moment I thought he was laying it on a little too much.  But I'll forgive him that small moment cause he's just dead on the rest of the time.At its heart THE VILLAGE is social commentary for both sides of an argument. For some they will look at these characters and think them pathetic.  Why give up your freedom for safety?  Why allow the government to fuel your fears?  But other will look at these characters and say `isn't it great that these people got away from the horror of this world? Isn't it wonderful that they created a utopia?  I wish I lived in The Village, free from all the evil influences of the world at large.' As for the patented surprise ending, it works sort of.  If you give the movie its due you'll be satisfied.  I smelled it from a mile away and still took a lot away from the movie.  If you don't buy the premise you'll be let down and hate the movie.  But that's okay.  Great movies don't have to be universally loved, as long as you don't leave the theater indifferent the movie will have an effect on you.  It will keep you talking and that's a good thing.

Little Miss Sunshine," That's what this film needed, Uncle Eddie!
","Just before I sat down to watch the film LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE I was leafing through a copy of Douglas Adam's final anthology of writings called The Salmon of Doubt. In an article he wrote called 'Turncoat' he mused 'I wonder if we don't have too much comedy these days...nowadays everybody's a comedian, even the weather girls... We laugh at everything. Not intelligently anymore, not with sudden shock, astonishment, or revelation, just relentlessly and meaninglessly.' After the movie was over I couldn't get that thought out of my head. Here is a film that attempts to be dark, attempts to be charming, attempts to be edgy, attempts to be independent, and is yet drops the ball because in the end it has nothing cohesive to say.Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) is the cutest little kid in the world. The kind of kid who just looks at the world with wide-eyed wonder. She sweet even if the world around her isn't so. Her Dad (Greg Kinnear) is a bad motivational speaker and an even worse role model, her mom (Toni Collette) is far to permissive, her brother (Paul Dano) hates his life and has taken a vow of silence, her grandpa (Alan Arkin) snorts heroin, and her Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) has shown up on their doorstep after a botched attempt to take his own life. This motley family is about to make a 700 mile trip in a beat up VW Van with a busted clutch to get Olive to the National Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest in Redondo Beach. Will they survive each other? Or will Olive's dream of becoming a beauty queen come crashing down? LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is the kind of movie that will leaving you feeling good at the end only because it ends on such a high note. The last ten minutes of this film are easily the best. They're what you're going to talking about as you leave the theater. As for the other 90 minutes well that's up in the air.The film is far to moody. There is a fine line between dark humor and just plain darkness. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE spends too much of it early scenes developing realistic characters. They laugh, they cry, and then the film betrays this honesty by asking them to fall into farce. The screenplay goes into auto-pilot and the characters turn into independent film clichés'.The actors do the best they can with the material but alas the film feels so artificial. You start to see some themes pop out that would make good talking points in an article or interview, but in the context of the film it's all just filler. Every character gets to wax poetic then they get to do something silly. Then the film makes some blanket statement about how life is as phony as a beauty contest, there is an act of rebellion, and then everybody hugs.The films biggest problem is that the screenplay is such a rip off of NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION. Except instead of Wally World the Hoovers are on their way to Redondo Beach and there is a Proust scholar in the car. There is even a scene in which a dead body shows up and they have to put it in their car. I was waiting for Randy Quaid to show up and ask Greg Kinnear's character for money. That's what this film needed, Uncle Eddie! LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is a 'dark comedy' that's far too dark and not really all that funny. It has it's moments, and on the surface it is very sweet and charming. Little Abigail Breslin steals the show, giving Olive a wisdom beyond her age, and a wide-eyed wonder. But unfortunately the film is not worth the price of admission. I'd skip this beauty contest.",3,51,103,21 September 2006
The Pianist," Passafist Dissects The Pianist using Castaway
","Hollywood Sucks!  I have just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece, a film that is about characters and events, that's lyrical and beautiful and all I can think of after it is how much of a tool Tom Hanks is.  Why is it that after experiencing Roman Polanski's THE PIANIST I can only think of Robert Zemeckis's CAST AWAY?  It's a really an eerie feeling, but go with me for a little while.  Maybe my ranting will begin to make sense.THE PIANIST is the powerful and lyrical life story of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrian Brody, Summer of Sam), a Jew living in Poland during World War II. It follows him from a peaceful life as a piano player on polish radio, to the ghetto's of Warsaw, to hiding in empty apartments, and all the while dreaming of life as it once was.  CASTAWAY is the story of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks, The Money Pit) a FedEx employee that gets trapped on a deserted island and in the end talks to volleyball. How are these two stories similar?  They're both about men trying to make through unbelievable circumstances and how they must do it alone.  One takes the Hollywood approach, where everything is ambiguously tied up at the end. The other takes a more lyrical approach, where a man returns to what he does best.  The Pianist takes the lyrical approach and in the end is more successful a story.Brody is fantastic.  For much of the film he's teetering on that thin line between madness and sanity.  Nothing more telling than the scene, in which, Szpilman, whom hasn't eaten in days, finds an unopened jar of pickles.  In his attempt to open that jar he is confronted by his worst fear, a German guard standing before him.  In a Hollywood film, this scene would be about Szpilman breaking free and running away.  But in the PIANST it about him longing for that can of pickles.  When he picks it up off the floor he holds onto it for dear life.  If his life is not taken by the guard he's got to eat so he's not letting go.  It's a small moment that is really powerful.I contrast that with Tom Hanks teetering on that thin line as well.  He has a friend, he talks to a volleyball.  But this relationship is far different. This relationship is about giving the actor something to talk to.  The most dramatic moment in this film is when he losses the Volleyball. Problem is the film suggests that the volleyball is a character and not a need, like food. This moment is so huge it spoils what should be a moment of discovery for the character. The moment when he can go on without his crutch, but all the audience cares about is a stupid volleyball.The final moments in THE PIANIST are also small but have strong impact. Moments before the credits roll we see Szpilmann sitting in an open field, wondering what to do next.  It then cuts to him doing what he's always done. He's beaten those who have tried to keep him down.  It's encouraging but the music doesn't have to swell, and the violins don't have to play.  It's a small intimate moment.  The scene does not force emotion, but there is much there.  It plays with life the way life really is, when the battle is over, we may have changed but we still sometimes go back to what we are good at. He one tha battle and he can play again.CASTAWAY puts the hero right in the middle of a literal crossroads.  What should he do next?  The camera circles around him, and he walks down a road. But while  Both moments are very similar, this moment is over sentimental.  It forces emotions and it fails to move you, you don't really care what road he choses.  It kind of diminishes his battle.  He has nowhere to go and I'm sure none of us want to follow.In film sometimes plot is inconsequential.  I would have loved to have been trapped on an island with Wladyslaw Szpilman as much as I didn't care about Chuck Noland on an island, and well he'd probably wind up gassed in a polish concentration camp had he come up in that time.  That's what is great about Brody's performance, he is in every  scene of this movie, and fills the screen with a character of depth and strength.  Hanks fills the screen with a character of no depth and mostly surface strength.It's amazing that I could compare two completely opposite films and explain how one fails and the other one works.  But I have found a new film I can call a favorite and another film I can never rent again.  One is powerful, the other dull and yet they have two characters that can be very similar.Do yourself a favor and rent THE PIANST, you won't be disappointed.",Null,1,3,17 July 2003
Gran Torino," Amazing!
","I hope that in 30 years someone decides to remake Gran Torino. Hopefully it will be a shot-by-shot remake like 1998's Psycho, or maybe someone tries to do a direct homage to it, or maybe a Japanese remake or didn't they make a Turkish version of Star Wars? I really don't care how they remake it. I just want to prove how masterfully Eastwood breathes life into a story that in wrong hands could be a melodramatic mess, or a bad Sitcom. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a guy missing his decade, he still lives in the home he raised his family in, even though the rest of the neighborhood disappeared years ago. His home is still painted while the homes around him fall apart. The post-war suburban paradise that once was is long gone replaced by gangs, crime, and the Hmong immigrants who have replaced his former white-bread neighbors. Kowalski has lived a life of hard work and maybe a little regret. He's a decorated Korean War Vet, a husband who's just buried his wife, and a father that has lost touch with his sons. Don't get him started on his bratty Grandkids who want him to die so they get his stuff including a sweet 1972 Gran Torino. Kowalski is a man who poured his heart and soul into a country who doesn't need him anymore and a family that is ready to send him off to Boca to die. Everything changes when he catches his neighbor trying to steal his Gran Torino, and he is introduced into a world that just might let him get the redemption he so desperately needs.Eastwood has crafted a beautiful film that is honest. With an approach that is so matter of fact and never over sentimental. In the wrong hands this could translate as boring. Yet Eastwood finds a way to make the film real without boring us. It's funny when it needs to be funny, gripping when it needs to grip, and emotional without being overtly emotional. Kowalski exists in the real world, he's abrasive, he's angry, he drinks, smokes, chews tobacco and has lived long enough to not have that politically correct filter that everyone in my generation was issued at birth. He built the world with his bare hands and wishes that people we're polite, kids respected their elders, and is tired of taking crap from everyone. But it's not because he's a monster and Eastwood instills a warmth in Kowalski that drives the film forward. The supporting cast works because they are real kids. Newcomer Ahney Her deserves notice as Sue, a smart plucky kid that Kowalski aids and Bee Vang hits the right marks as Thao, Sue's brother who Kowalski takes under his wing. Eastwood doesn't ask for gut-wrenching performances from these two kids, only honesty and that's why they work. When the climax hits it's apex Eastwood doesn't ask his cast to react as characters in a movie, but as regular kids. Gran Torino is not what I expected, it's not Dirty Harry meets Grumpy Old Men. It's a powerful film that sneaks up on you and pulls you along. At any moment it could have been shallow, at any moment it could have been melodramatic, and at any moment we could have hated Kowalski. Trust me there is plenty not to like about this guy, but Eastwood shows us his frustrations, and emotions not by acting them out, but by being real and by giving Kowalski a warmth we don't expect. Gran Torino makes me wish I had treasured the moments I could have had with my Grandfather. It also challenges me to reach out even If I don't want to. Gran Torino is not about telling a fake story about redemption, it's about real people with real problems and how they find within themselves the power to take responsibility for their lives and in that they find the strength to overcome what life has dealt them. Gran Torino will not change the world but it may make you look at your fellow man with a little more compassion.",10,2,6,13 January 2009
Mulholland Drive," Passafist Reviews Mullholland Drive
","How do you review a film like Mullholland Drive?  What do you tell people? How do you explain what you've just witnessed? That's the most agrivating thing about this film.  There's a story here, after one viewing I think I have it, but do I?I've actually driven on Mullholland Drive.  Even in the Daytime it's a little freaky, it's up in the Hollywood Hills, and even though you're in one of the biggest cities in the world, it feels like a no mans land.  All these big houses with huge gates, and yet not a soul in sight.  Man that movie was on big mind freak!!!Naomi Watts (The Ring) plays Betty a small town girl who's just stepped off a plane into the City of Angels.  She has a rich aunt who's letting her stay in her apart while she shoots a movie in Canada. Betty has dreams of making it as an actress, she won a jitterbug contest at home why couldn't she? Now imagine you shock if you got home and there was a naked woman in your shower.   That woman calls herself Rita. The enchantingly beautiful Laura Elena Harring (Willard) plays her, she doesn't know who she is or how she got where she was.  Except that the night before she was in a horrible car accident, in which she was the only survivor.There is also a film director named Adam, who's being forced to cast an actress he doesn't want in his new film.  There is a cowboy (Monty Montgomery) who's looking for him.  Plus there's a hitman (Matt Pellegrino) and two executives, one who never says a word (Dan Hedya), the other who hates the studio Espresso ((Composer Angelo Badalamenti) I guess it's too bad he never got that damn fine cup of coffee in Twin Peaks) and a guy in a restaurant who had a bad dream.As the film progress all these characters and more walk in and out, and for the most part your not sure why.  The film is full of clues to solve the mystery, but what are clues and what are red herrings?  We'll probably never know.I liked the scenes where Betty is practicing her lines for an audition with Rita.  I like how the lines are played with the dashing old actor (Chad Everett).  What a difference playing close and playing far away make.  I liked the Director in the scene (Wayne Grace) who is manipulated by everyone else.The films last 40 minutes have to be seen to believe.  Yes, there is the infamous lesbian sex scene.  But there's more than that.  The film also begins to unravel?  The dream begins to end and the film which up until then has been very light and tongue and cheek takes a very, very dark turn. Everything gets tied up, but only more questions are left unanswered.Mullholland Drive is the kind of movie that will be discussed forever. What does everything mean?  Who is the dark wino who freaks out the man who had a dream about Winkies?  What was the point of that scene?  What is the blue box? What is the blue key? What is the woman singing about at the strange concert? What's in the Black Book?  What David Lynch's Dwarf friend up to this time? I'm convinced David Lynch knows, but he's not telling.So I'll leave you with one Word: SILENCIO!!",Null,1,2,3 June 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The Adventures of *BLEEP*
","Have you ever read a book where you sort of got into it, but you're not quite sure if you like it.  The story is good enough to keep you interested and yet you know in your heart you've read better.  You get to the point where the story begins to pick up a little and then you put it down never to pick it back up again?  I've done that so many times I can't fathom how many half-read books I have on my bookshelf.  Quentin Tarantino's (Pulp Fiction) new film KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 is very much like that.  It's watch able, it somewhat compelling, and at the moment it begins to pick up, the credits roll.KILL BILL stars UMA THURMAN (Pulp Fiction) as The Bride (I prefer to call her *Bleep*, cause early in the film they bleep her name out three times and I thought it was kind of funny), a women on a quest for revenge.  It seems *Bleep* was getting married when a group of really bad dudes crashed the party, killing everyone, including her unborn baby.  That is except for *Bleep* who somehow and against all odd survives and now she's out for blood.She begins picking off everybody who was involved in the plot to murder her. In Volume One she meets up with Vernita (Vivica A Fox, Juwanna Mann), now a housewife with a husband and a child and O-Ren Ishi, a sexy underworld leader in Tokyo.  She also makes friends with an old Mr. Myiagi type (Sonny Chiba, Immortal Combat) who designs kick ass swords and quotes old eastern proverbs like they've gone out of fashion.To be honest there isn't much to talk about concerning this film.  Except to say that its pretty violent in a silly stylized way, the action scenes are well worth the price of admission, and that unlike most movies this one is missing a core story.  We never find out who The Bride is, we don't know why Bill (played incognito by David Carradine, G.O.D.) wants to kill *Bleep*, and we don't know why  *Bleep* doesn't have a name.  It's just one action scene after another and we're not quite sure whom to root for.Of the movies that could have been split up into two parts this film is not a prime candidate  (1995 Gettysburg would have probably faired better in two parts). The way it's edited now it feels like a pilot for a television series and not a film.  I'm not even quite sure if I liked it or not. There's not enough here to make a distinction.  I guess it looks really good, the action sequences are top-notch, and there's an anime sequence that would make a great short by itself.  Other than that it's an action film that is really not about anything.As for the performances, the only one that sticks out is Lucy Liu (Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever) who has an amazing screen presence to begin with.  In fact if there is a character in this movie that's worth rooting for, it's her.  But I think that's because she's the only character that the film digs deep into.  The aforementioned anime sequence is her back-story.
Come to think of it KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 is like the first two stages of a `Double Dragon' type video game.  Each scene has little guys you need to kill and then a boss.  I guess Bill will be the final boss, let's just hope that he's a hard kill.  Cause I want Volume 2, to lift Volume 1 out of the gutter.So at this point I reserve judgement either way until KILL BILL: VOLUME 2 is released in February.  Cause right now it's on that thin line between a great movie and a mediocre one. On it's own it's only worth the price of admission to action freaks and kung fu enthusiasts.  All others would probably do themselves better by waiting to see both movies together,

Saw II," Vengeance begets more vengeance. Sometimes it's good to walk away.
","As a Christian I always find it funny when people accuse me of legalism, and hypocrisy. For don't we live in a world where everybody expects everybody to do and act the way we want them too? Don't we all at some point ostracize people for being a little off o r out of place? The freaks call the beautiful stuck up, and the beautiful pay no attention to the ugly. We flip off the guy who cuts us off and we hate him because he inconvenienced us for one small moment. We're all guilty of doing somebody wrong, and then when we are wronged we expect the other person to apologize. We want vengeance, and we want the world to think and act just like us. If not we hate them. Trust me we're all guilty at some point, even I am That is just one of the wild thoughts that permeated my mind while sitting through SAW II. Yes, I'll admit it's odd that I would have a somewhat religious epiphany while people are hacking themselves to pieces. But that's the beauty of Horror. It's about processing the horror into something productive, while enjoying the scares.The Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bond) is back. This time he's locked a bunch of people in a gory fun-house of his own design. The house is slowly filling with a gas that will kill the inhabitants unless they can find the antidote. One of the Jigsaw Killers victims is the son of Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), a local cop. Matthews and the local swat team have the Jigsaw Killer in their grasp. What follows is a psychological game that matches the law with a man whose unafraid to die.SAW II is one of those rare sequels that works because you get to find out more about the psychopath. In this film we get to delve into the mind of the Jigsaw Killer (who goes by the name of John), see a little more about why and how he operates. Tobin Bond keeps him creepy and yet charismatic enough to be believable. Like a poor mans Hannibal Lecter there is a method and meaning to his madness but he's not a cartoon. He's a man on his deathbed with nothing to lose, and a theory of life that is so practical that if he channeled his concepts into motivational speaking and not murder and carnage he could be a millionaire.I liked that the movie didn't play fast and loose with the carnage and at the same time realized when enough was enough. In this PG-13 Horror movie world it's so easy to pull back to reach a younger audience. But SAW II is smart enough to raise the bar, and let you process the mystery. Whose holding the cards? Is it the Jigsaw Killer? Is it the cops? I also thought the ensemble in the house worked well together, I just wish the screenplay had given them more to do than just stumble around and scream at each other. I also thought the stunning revelation about 'X marking the spot' came far to late for the characters to really care about who was in the picture. When your life is almost over you're not really worrying about who put you in jail.Director Darren Lynn Bousman tries his dandiest not to make the same mistakes of the first film, by laying off the camera tricks in favor actually allowing the actors to act. Sure he wiggles the camera around a little, adds some quick cuts to places. But he doesn't use those devices to amplify action that's boring. My one little qualm was with the screenplay. I liked the stuff in the house so much more than the police procedural parts. I wished that the movie had delved into the whole numbers thing and the mysteries of the people in the house a little more.SAW II is engrossing if you let it be. On the surface it could be construed as just another slasher knock-off. But the power lies in the Jigsaw character and how and why he's manipulating the background. It's also a film that explores our own dark side. Jigsaw's real beef with the people in the story is that their wasting their lives. Their killing their bodies, they're hurting other, and their tearing their families apart. But the truth lies in the fact that legalism, and your own pursuit to change another persons thinking can also be skewed. So the next time you cut that guy off, or the next time you cut off that guy. Just think to yourself, I've been wronged but should I really wrong back. Vengeance begets more vengeance. Sometimes it's good to walk away.",8,0,2,4 November 2005
World Trade Center," WORLD TRADE CENTER is a deeply moving example of people who wanted only one thing: to get home from work that day.
","There is a key scene missing from Oliver Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER. It's the scene that is forever burned in my brain. We saw it hundreds of times, over and over, the local news couldn't help but show us it with a frequency that could only be called sadistic. Since the scene is not present here the film works. Because it's not there the film has a resonance much higher and more powerful. WORLD TRADE CENTER is a film that has all the cards stacked against it and succeed because it remembers that 9/11 was not a day about politics, it was not a day about heroes or villains. No, 9/11 was a day about people doing their jobs and stepping up in the face of tragedy.When John McLoughin (Nicholas Cage)and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) showed up for work on this morning they never expected to find themselves buried under the rubble of the Twin Towers. They assumed the day would be pretty uneventful. They kissed their wives, hugged their kids and went to work. But, when duty called these men answered it, and found themselves trapped. Leaving their families wondering, their friends comforting, and a country mourning. In a matter of hours these two Port Authority Police Officers fought for survival, and made themselves and many other men heroes. A lot can happen in the midst of evil, and sometimes it can inspire the greatest good.What WORLD TRADE CENTER does best is transport us back to that day. When we woke up that morning all was well, by the time we went to bed the whole world felt the repercussions. On September 11th politics was put on the back burner, our petty differences fell away, and we became united. Some gave blood, others cleaned up, for one grand moment America seemed like one. American flags flew, police and rescue workers streamed into the city to help, the once loathed Mayor became a hero, and the President's rally cries were heard and accepted. Oliver Stone's film captures those moments with such reckless ease, its amazing he got away with it.The film is the embodiment of people who are holding onto the mundane problems in the world. Holding onto the mundane because the gravity of the world around them is too much to bare. My favorite moment involves Jimeno talking about the theme song to Starsky and Hutch. On the surface it's a man trying to use comedy to quell his fear, but the scene goes deeper, this man is holding onto a stupid television show because it proves he's still alive. Hollywood has given us hero's whose lives are so exciting and are always exciting. But real people have down time, they laugh, they go see stupid movies, and watch stupid television shows. The only way to hold on is to revert to the mundane, it's the only cure for a world gone insane.Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena embody McLoughlin and Jimeno with real humanity. The film traps them under rubble for most of the films running time, so all they have is their voices, their emotions, and their humanity to get them through.On the surface, Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal play these men's wives with a vulnerability and fierceness. We see their pain, none so clear, as when Gyllenhaal as Jimeno's wife wanders aimlessly around a pharmacy trying to clear her head, or getting out of the car because the red light is too long. That light never seems so long as when you need to get somewhere fast.I've heard many say 'how dare they make this movie?' 'How dare Hollywood profit from this tragedy?' I say 'how dare we leave our history to be written by people with an agenda., by people who didn't live through it?' Ten years from now I would be proud to show this film to the next generation, to show them that amidst all the upheaval, amidst all the tragedy, America was united for one brief moment. WORLD TRADE CENTER has no agenda except to harken back to a time we've since lost.WORLD TRADE CENTER is missing one key scene. It's missing the planes flying into the building. This is not a film about terrorists, or evil. This isn't even a film about the Twin Towers. This is not a film about planes, presidents, or what has happened since. WORLD TRADE CENTER is a deeply moving example of people who wanted only one thing: to get home from work that day.",10,4,10,14 August 2006
Big Fish," An Instant Classic
","There is something exhilarating about riding two trains and running 27 blocks down the street to see a movie.  Living 8 or so miles outside New York City has its perks for one of my new jobs.  Going to press screenings of yet to released blockbusters.  It's just to bad I'm at the mercy of the New Jersey Transit rail system.  With delayed trains and lots of snow covering the ground of course I had 10 minutes to get from Madison Square Garden to Union Square.  No small feat if you ask me.But as I settled down in my chair at the Regal Union Square, and as I sipped on the sweet nectar of the drink called COKE, a film unfolded.  A film so good, it made my mad dash to the theater worth every minute and as I reminisce about the filmed triumph that is BIG FISH, I feel a sense of awe and wonder.  Tim Burton has created a film better than EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and a film that is worthy of Oscar.William Bloom (Billy Crudup, Waking The Dead) is mad at his father Edward Bloom (Albert Finney,Erin Brockovich).  You see his dad loves to tell stories about his youth.  Except none of them seem true.  Stories of Giants named Karl (Matthew McGrory, Bubble Boy), Circus Freaks, wandering poets, Siamese Twins from Red China, bank robberies, a witch, and a really big fish.  William longs to meet the real man behind all the stories.  But when Edward is stricken with cancer, William comes face to face with the man, both the real one and the legend.BIG FISH is the kind of movie where a new surprise is hiding around every corner.  From babies being spit across the hospital floor to a classic car being submerged underwater.  The frame is jammed with visions both colorful and humorous.  I especially liked the witch whose one eye could tell you how you would die.  What an eerie and yet oddly beautiful old woman she was.
I also loved the tender moment that Edward and his wife Sandy (Jessica Lange, Titus) had in the bathtub.  It's a scene full of both raw emotion and sweet reflection.  Here's a woman who's watching the man she loves die right in front of her face.  Every moment counts, and every word and breath sacred.Ewan MacGregor (Star Wars: Attack of the Cloans) does a fine job as young Edward the adventurous youth of all his older counterpoint fantastical stories.  His performance strikes the right cords at the right moments, allowing the audience to take hold of a man who may be the fabrication or the true version of a man who's telling the story.Tim Burton's directing is top notch.  He's proven that he's a master of the visual image, and BIG FISH is the perfect film to allow people to sit up and take notice.  He strikes the right cord between humor and tears, joyous circus's and scary forests.  His deft eye even takes us behind enemy lines. In a scene that is both inspired and quirky all at the same time.BIG FISH is also a film about heritage.  What's more important in the scheme of things, how we lived or how people remember us? It's a little of both, and this film puts us right in the middle of it all.  Watching a life unfold around us.BIG FISH is the reason I love going to the movies.  Sure sometimes you have to dig through the trash to find a gem and this is a gem of a motion picture.  If you see one film at all this year BIG FISH is worth a trip, even a whirlwind 27-block sprint to your local theater.",Null,0,0,8 December 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Can You Figure It Out?
","So what happens when you mix Carrey with Screenwriter Charlie Kaufmann, one of the few offbeat writers that continues to get work done in the Hollywood system?  ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF A SPOTLESS MIND is what you get.  The film tells the story of Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet).  Two lovers who are torn apart and yet drawn together by tattered memories.  You see an enterprising doctor named Howard (Tom Wilkenson) has created a medical process in which people can be removed from your memory ultimately removing them from your life.  It seems Clemintine has already undergone this process and so Joel does the same thing.  That is until he realizes our memories make us and it might regret losing them.I sometimes wonder what the early pioneer's of film would think of what it has become today.  Like any great media it's had its hurdles of technical innovation to jump through. Would they like what they saw or would they be like the old man who sat behind me at ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND?  He hated it, for all the wrong reasons.So do we make memories or do memories make us?  That is the basic premise of the story.  We watch with frantic hope to grasp the story as it runs through Joel's mind.  It's told in a style that is far from linear, jumping from moment to moment without much time to breathe.  Like some bizarre `Alice in Wonderland' adventure.  I kept hoping to see the Cheshire Cat's grim jump into the frame.  Sometimes the film gets a little crazy and yet the movie is strangely engrossing.  That is if you let it.So what happens when you mix Carrey with Screenwriter Charlie Kaufmann, one of the few offbeat writers that continues to get work done in the Hollywood system?

You have to engage your eyes and brain and put pieces together.  Half the fun of this film is interpretation.  If you can't you'll hate it.  I mean if you walk into this movie with hopes of BRUCE ALMIGHTY you'll probably feel as gypped as those Adam Sandler fans that laid out money for PUNCHDRUNK LOVE.That being said the film does overstay it's welcome especially after it weaves in subplots involving Kiresten Dunst and Elijah Wood.  I understand their inclusion in the film I just wished they didn't feel so curt.  They sort of reemphasize points that's are already made by Joel and Clemintine in far more effective ways.  They steal from the self-discovery of the hero, and thus knock the movie down pegs it really didn't have to.So will you like ETERNAL SUNSHINE?  If you're in for an inventive trip with lots of suppress, and you also like to discuss the nature of philosophy and it's effect on man, absolutely.  If not I check something a little lighterI think a casual movie-goer is used to seeing a name like Julia Roberts or Adam Sandler and knowing exactly what to expect from them.  Jim Carrey on the other hand keeps throwing us all for a loop.  He's an actor whose climbed and fought his way to the top because he has the ability to be himself in any role, and yet at the same time engross his audience into believing he's not really there.  With the right director Jim Carrey can shine, even if the material is weak.  He shines in this film even if it doesn't quite match up.",Null,0,2,25 April 2004
The Last Samurai," SAKI!!!!!!!!!!!
","Every year a crop of prestige pictures get dumped out of the major studios in Hollywood.  Every one of these large scale epics is full of wild battles, romance, outstanding performances, and the cream of the crop celebrities. These are the films that are especially created to win the coveted Academy Awards.  The problem is every year one film is so big, so bloated, and so prestigious it turns into a silly mess.  This year's film is EDWARD ZWICK'S THE LAST SAMURAI.  A fun action film that longs to be SCHINDLER'S LIST.The Last Samurai stars Tom Cruise (Vanilla Sky) as Captain Algern, a soldier who stood with General Custer as he made his famous last stand.  While in battle he is forced to kill innocent Native American women and children, and it eats away at his soul.  Turning him to drink. When his old associates give him a job training Japanese soldiers to fight against a Samurai warrior named Katsumoto (Ken Wantanabe, T.R.Y.). Everything seems okay.  That is until he's captured by Katsumoto and begins to learn the law of the Samurai.THE LAST SAMURAI at it's best boasts some of the most breathtaking close up battle scenes I've seen in a long time.  I could hardly believe that for once I could follow the battles, because for the first time in a long time the camera stayed pretty steady.  It simply wasn't sound effects and shaky steady cams moving around.  It was real, and true battle choreography.  Now that made me smile.I also loved the scene in which Algern battles a group of overzealous Japanese soldiers who are attacking his friend.  The scene actually works and is a rare sight.  A modern fight scene that doesn't feature wire effects or CGI.  It reminded me of old Bruce Lee movies.  A scene that was about a fight and not about special effects creating it.SAMURAI also features a nice relationship between Algern and Katsumoto. Enemies that become friends, Wantanabe's character is strong because it feels real.  Unlike SONNY CHIBA's silly turn as the proverb spouting sword dealer in KILL BILL.  Wantanabe exudes the feeling of a real Samurai and not of a silly Kung Fu movie reject.  I loved how he could embody this man who is torn between his country and his king.  SAMURAIS real flaw is that it thinks it's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE SEVEN SAMURAI, CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, and DANCES WITH WOLVES, when it's really just a fun battle movie.  It takes itself far too seriously.  You watch it with this feeling that at any moment you'll see a graphic pop on the screen that says `FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.'It also gets the award for the silliest and most melodramatic thing screamed by an actor in peril in 2003.  Algern is going through alcohol withdrawal and screams `SAKI' at the top of his lungs.  I was sitting next to my brother-in-law, and every time the film hit another stupidly melodramatic moment I would whisper `Saki!!'  It kept me entertained.I was also aghast that in front of me a small boy no more than five was sitting there.  There is a pretty gruesome scene in which a man loses his head.  Never have a felt so badly for a little child than I did when he screamed out in terror and then latched onto his mothers shoulder.  LISTEN PARENTS OF THE WORLD, THE RATING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED SO THAT THIS KIND OF THING DOESN'T HAPPEN.  YOU WANT TO WATCH AN R-RATED MOVIE RENT IT AT YOUR LEISURE.  DON'T BRING A FIVE YEAR OLD TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH IT. (Calming Down) Thank you!THE LAST SAMURAI is a mixed bag.  On one hand its breathtaking to watch and on the other its kinda of silly.  I'm going to recommend it to those whom like really cool battle sequences.  But for the rest of you why not give THE SEVEN SAMURAI or even BRAVHEART a chance.  They are far better films.",Null,1,1,27 December 2003
The Da Vinci Code," If I had to sum THE DAVINCI CODE up in one word, it would be lackluster
","If I had to sum THE DAVINCI CODE up in one word, it would be lackluster. It's the kind of movie that will have its defenders. But for the most part, they will be defending Dan Brown's Novel, not Ron Howard's movie. It's not that the film is incompetent. It just doesn't try hard enough. It sits there never quite compelling you to do anything but watch it. It's a thriller with very little thrills.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), Harvard University's most gifted Symbologist, is in Paris giving a lecture on his new book. When he is accidentally thrown into the middle of a murder investigation, in which he is the prime suspect. His only allies are Sophie Neveu, the murdered man's granddaughter, and Sir Leigh Teabing, an eccentric Brit with a passion for the holy grail. Langdon must outrun an over zealous police chief (Jean Reno), a psychotic Albino Monk (Paul Bettany), and a mysterious man called only The Teacher. In the process he stumbles over the biggest mystery of our age: just what is the Holy Grail? Director Ron Howard does his best to keep us interested in the story. It's been simplified and changed drastically from the source material, probably so that modern moviegoers can grasp the material a little easier. The thing that surprised me most about the changes in the story, were how they dramatically changed Robert Langdon's character motivations. The Langdon of Dan Brown's famous novel is an expert in the Grail symbology and goes as far as to defend it to Sophie. In the film he plays more of the Devil's Advocate questioning more and going as far as to call most of it bunk. This changes the end of the film dramatically taking a bit of real passion out of it. In essence you're left with a postmodern twist on the story that zaps a lot of meaning out of the plot.Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman script shies away from the controversy of Dan Brown's book, it feels as if the producers sensed a boycott and got cold feet. I think it hurts the film. Honestly, if your going to court controversy you should jump full in. If not you've lost the battle. Now I wished I hadn't slaved through Brown's book. The film doesn't fill you with much desire to read the book it's based on.On a purely cinematic level it fails because it's not all that compelling. None of the characters are drawn full enough for you to care about them. They are lost in a film that has a point A and a point B, but the journey to get there is paved with boring car chases, fake drama, sloppy gun play and incredibly stilted reveals. No one seems to have any honest motivation, and problems are solved but not explained. For instance Langdon and Sophie have this thing called a cryptex, they need to solve a code to get a piece of paper out of it. But instead of showing us how Langdon figured out the code it just jumps to him solving it.My favorite moment was when Langdon and Sophie need to get to a library to figure out a riddle. In Dan Brown's novel they spend hours in a library, in the film Sophie borrows some random guy's cell phone and they figure it out on a bus. I chuckled.All in all THE DAVINCI CODE is the kind of movie that's made to cash in on one of the most popular books in recent history. Its got star power, its got a big name director, its got a giant budget. But it's missing a human touch. It's missing a central heart. It's not a film about people. It's a film that just sits there and then fades to black. Amidst the controversy, amidst the hype, the boycotts, and the millions it will rake in at the box-office THE DAVINCI CODE is much 'ado about nothing.'",2,36,72,19 May 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Thought on THE MATRIX RELOADED: THE IMAX EXPERIENCE
","I don't know who invented the tracking shot.  But I do know that IMAX re-invented it.   When you go to an average movie theater you sit down for a mostly passive experience.  But with IMAX you body is immersed in a movie. I've seen a few of the beautiful nature films and sweeping films about far off planets that IMAX has brought us.  But nothing prepared me for THE MATRIX RELOADED THE IMAX EXPERIENCE.If you've seen this film on the smaller movie screen and you liked it.  I guarantee you'll like it even more on the IMAX screen.  Great sequences are even better.  The details are magnified, and the computer-generated effects are much clearer.  But the best part is how as the camera tracks around the various scenes and your body moves with them.As the film opens, you are actually drawn into the Matrix.  As the camera sweeps between and in and out of that green programming code, you body feels the motion.  It's breath taking.  It's a feeling you can't have at you're local Loews.  The best scene to utilize the IMAX is the scene in which NEO is fighting the hundred Agent Smiths.  When he leaps up into the air and back into the crowd of Smith's your heart jumps.  As he swings the street pole around his head, your head moves along with the motion.   There is also a great moment when Agent Smith and Neo fly into a wall.  As they bang into it, they actually hit the screen with a huge crack.  You feel like it's almost hit you.  It's amazing.While many have argued that this film is a terrible movie.  I think for once, they missed the point. Yes, RELOADED is full of long drawn out exposition scenes.  Scenes in which characters discuss computer lingo, and programming glitches, as well as Gnostic and, Eastern Philosophies, and while many had problems with that.  I had not one problem with them. (For the record the mass orgy scene fails on every count and is a major flaw in the film)  They do what they are designed to do, that is to offer a lot to think about, or maybe nothing at all.  At the end of the day and after thousands of scholarly papers are written on the subject.  It doesn't matter, nor should it.  I don't think THE MATRIX will save the word or be an important film but it will always be lots of fun.Personally I also found the movie has a high replay value. It has lots of little moments and nuances that you miss the first time.  It's also fun to put the pieces together, all the plot points that went over your head the first time.I also gained an appreciation for the supporting cast.  Especially Lambert Wilson as Merovingian, his speech on second viewing is really funny.  It's such a small role and he has such a good time with it.
I really hope that THE MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS pulls no punches and ups the ante.  I hope that many if not all the ideas that surround THE MATRIX are made a little clearer.  Because of course that can only strengthen the film series as a whole.  But I also hope the film keeps it's sense of fun (I heard on a police radio during the freeway scene a cop calling, saying he was ADAM-12Â…That Made Me Smile).If you didn't like the film, I still recommend THE IMAX EXPERIENCE.

The Matrix Reloaded," TWO WORDS..'WA-OW, WOW.'
","The Matrix RE-Loaded raises the bar of action flicks.  Bombs bursting here, Uzi's bursting there and the biggest surprise Keanu has learned to act.Reloaded picks up where The Matrix left off.  A group of Freedom Fighters, led by Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburn, continue their assault against the machines that have enslaved the Human Race in The Matrix. This time we get a glimpse of Zion, the last free human city. We meet a cast of new characters including Jada Pinkett-Smith as Niobi, and Link, played by Harold Perrineau Jr., who pilot's Morpheus's ship the biblically named Nebecanezzer.  Plus, Neo played by Keanu Reeves and Trinity played by Carrie Ann-Moss, are back and this time around the movie centers on their budding romance. There is a story here, a good one in fact, but it would take a book to explain, so lets move on. What I can tell you is there is a fantastic chase scene that takes up most of the second act, and boy is it cool.  Cars flipping, trucks crashing, Motorcycles jumping here and there.  It's a high-octane rush.  All brilliantly choreographed almost like ballet.  It end on a perfect note, with a spectacular shot I won't even begin to describe cause it's worth the price of admission.Now comes the part of the review I hate, that moment when I have to mention what I disliked about the film.  There is a scene early in the film, where Neo and Trinity consummate their love.  The scene plays out longer than necessary, and really stops the story dead in its tracks.  We get the point 3 minutes before it's over and I a serious blight to the film.  I mention this scene to tell parents to keep young children and teenagers away from this film.  It's fun for it's target audience 17 and up The Matrix Re-Loaded earns it's R rating.This is the Best Blockbuster Popcorn Flick I've seen all year.   If you do decide to see the Matrix Re-Loaded do me two favors, 1) If you haven't seen the first one in a while rent it cause you'll be lost and 2) Stay 'til the very end of the credits and you'll be treated to a short trailer for The Matrix Revolutions due out this November.On a Scale of 1-5 I give this Bad Boy ****1/2.",Null,0,0,14 May 2003
Mystic River," Man Why'd I GO and Ruin This Movie For Myself?
","My FiancÃ© and I like to watch LAW AND ORDER on TV.  She spends the whole episode trying to figure it out the mystery.  I watch the opening moments, meet all the characters, and think about it for a moment and of course I call the outcome 90% of the time.  It doesn't mean that I don't enjoy sitting through a good mystery.  It's just after a while it becomes more difficult for me not to figure out what happens in the end.That's the problem I had with Clint Eastwood's (Blood Work) new film MYSTIC RIVER. It's a riveting and tense thriller, it's one of the best films of year and of course I went and ruined it for myself by figuring out the outcome about an hour before the movie ended.  Was it the `Old Economy of Characters' that made it so easy? Not really!  I think it's just the film has one logical ending and if you miss the clues you'll kick yourself in the head.The story follows three friends in South Boston.  They are Jimmy (Sean Penn, I Am Sam), Dave (Tim Robbins, Bob Roberts), and Sean (Kevin Bacon, Wild Things).  As kids, Dave was kidnapped and raped by some guys dressed liked cops, they kept him in a dirty cellar for four years until he escaped. He got home but he never quite recovered.  Jimmy grew up to be a petty thief, served two years in prison, and is now a legitimate shopkeeper is his neighborhood, and Sean is now a detective with a marriage that's almost non-existent.  These three friends are forced to come to grips with their friendship when Jimmy's daughter (Emmy Rossum, Songcatcher) winds up murdered.  MYSTIC RIVER is about the sins of our past, mistaken identities, and those small moments that change our lives forever.  It's about what ties us all together, how we face our demons, and the bonds of friendship and family. It's also about flawed people forced to face the demons.  It's probably the best-acted film I've seen all year.Sean Penn gives the performance of a lifetime.  I finally forgive him for the travesty that was I AM SAM and I'm hoping that he moves on as well. There is a powerful moment, as he must tell his wife (Laura Linney, The Life of David Gale) that his daughter (From a first marriage) is dead.  The two of them look at each other for a moment and then embrace.  This kind of scene is very rarely powerful, in most films it's almost laughable, but all I could think was `Wow!'  For once it wasn't mucked up.  For once a director allowed raw power to move a scene and not harsh swelling music.Clint Eastwood has proved once again that with the right material he can direct a film that is smart and well told.  He has a very shaky track record, for every UNFORGIVEN, there are messes like TRUE CRIME and BLOOD WORK.  MYSTIC RIVER is better than UNFORGIVEN, but these two films will be considered classics.I liked MYSTIC RIVER.  I liked how it unfolded.  I just wish I could have shut my brain down because I hate it when I call the end of a good mystery. It reminded me of the moment when I called the end of THE OTHERS.  Of course I loved the film, but I felt cheated by my own cleverness.  I sometimes wish I could enjoy a movie like the masses.  But since I can't,  I will sing MYSTIC RIVER'S praises, and beseech the Academy to nominate Penn for this performance, he deserves it.So, If you're looking for a taught thriller with lots of mystery give MYSTIC RIVER a chance.  It's well worth two hours of your time.****1/2  (out of 5)",Null,0,1,16 October 2003
Love Actually," The Best (and Frustrating)Romantic Comedy I've Seen In Years
","When I think back on the genres that consistently let me down romantic comedies and teen flicks are at the top of the list.  Why do I still go and see them? That's easy, one cinematic gem out of 50 flops is why I, you're humble (or egomaniacal, you pick) reviewer, likes movies in the first place. I love to wallow in the muck until I find the small treasures of cinema.  I love movies that transform their genre. Films that are above average in quality and that are not at all conventional.  Movies like that make me joyful again.  That is the spirit in which I can approach a film like Richard Curtis's LOVE ACTUALLY.  It is so close to being my favorite romantic comedy I almost wished that my own stupid sense of right and wrong didn't mess it up for me. This is a movie that's so good that it's flaws are doubly illuminated.
Love is everywhere or at least that's the premise that Hugh Grant's (About a Boy) opening narration claims.  Then the movie goes on to prove just that. We watch as 10 or 15 delightful and charming people fall in love.  And in the end each of these people is also connected either directly or indirectly to the other characters in the movie and so in the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a small microcosm of British society. The film has charming written all over it.  Hugh Grant again plays that charming and debonair lady-killer he's gotten so good at playing.  Colin Firth (Bridget Jones's Dairy) plays this charming writer who falls for his maid, who doesn't speak English.  Emma Thompson (Junior) plays a mother and wife trying to come to grips with a tragedy in her own mind.  Liam Neeson (Schindler's List) play a widower who's young son has fallen `desperately' in love.  And While all this is going on, Alan Rickman (Dogma) and Laura Linney falls people in their office and Keira Knightly (Bend It Like Beckham) marries the man of her dreams, only to discover a little secret about his best friend.  As you can see a lot is going on here.  I can best be described as if you took a hundred romantic comedies and jammed them together.  Kind of a silly and romantic version of Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS.Thankfully most of the major characters are fun, charming, and bring their own little piece of life to the film.  There is scene after scene of inventive fun.  I also liked how the film was full of silly cameo's that didn't destroy the overall structure.  Sure I saw Billy Bob Thorton, but the film didn't try to jam him down my throat.  I found my self momentarily going there's Billy Bob, but he embodies his character (The US President, think George W. Bush with Clinton's Libido), he's not playing Billy Bob.The most interesting story arc follows Grant and his secretary (Martine McCutcheon, TV's Eastenders).  It's pitch perfect.  Every scene of him and McCutcheon made me smile.  I wanted to the see the outcome. I truly wanted these two people to fall in love.  It's hard for me to want to think that about characters in a more vapid rom-com.It's scenes and characters like Grant and McCutcheon that make the weaker moments of the film fail miserably.  Most notably the stupid segments involving the stand-in's on the porno movie set and the dumb scenes involving the annoying British boy who goes to Wisconsin.  I wanted to watch characters that were involving.  These two story arcs were built on cartoon premises.  They're both weaker, like two bad jokes in an utterly flawless comedy routine.  They were both to silly, and did not have enough development to warrant their inclusion in this film.The film also suffers from an overload of characters.  With so many interesting people to follow, it was difficult to dwell on one set of characters.  In the end you wind up getting the Cliff's Notes view of all these people. This hurts the Laura Linney (Maze) story most notably, because Curtis's screenplay tries to introduce dramatic scenes that are barely touched upon.  This makes at least one heart-wrenching scene in a mental hospital feel a little out of place.  Like it was tacked on cause every comedy needs a dramatic moment.I also hated that the screenplay glossed over much of the Rickman's characters humanity.  Leaving the final outcome of his story arc vague, cause god forbid we leave the movie hating one of the main characters.  If you're going to waste time creating tension only to keep us in the dark in the end don't waste my time.In the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a wholly frustrating and equally a great film. It's chock full of funny characters, silly romance, tragic stories, and in the end it delivers a movie that is mostly worth watching. 
I would also be remiss if I didn't mention Bill Nighy's (Underworld) wonderfully silly Billy Mack, a character that is really funny if a tad bit unnecessary. He plays an aging rock musician who's re-written one of his classic tunes into a Christmas song.  Sure he's sold out, but he sure won't promote it as if he did.  If Oscar has a funny bone, this performance is worth a supporting actor nomination.Listen if you can shut out the flaws, LOVE ACTUALLY will leave you satisfied.  If you're like me, then you like the movie with maybe a few too many reservations.  LOVE ACUTALLY is the best romantic comedy I've seen in a long time, and one of the best (if frustrating) movies of the year.****1/2 (out of 5)",Null,0,1,3 November 2003
Bruce Almighty," The Thin Line Between Blasphemy and Comedy
","My buddy Randy was the first one to say it but it's kind of a philosophy for me now.  I try to walk that thin line between blasphemy and comedy. Between what's really funny and what's offensive.  Being a pretty strait-laced protestant, their's nothing worse than bad Christian bashing joke. All I have to say is Ha Ha look at that dirty pagan going to hell and I get the last laugh. That's why a film like Bruce Almighty works for me.  It's an attack on silly humans not on God.  Those silly human who destroy their lives and blame it on the Almighty.  It's a morality play with laughs.        Bruce Nolan(Jim Carrey), our hero, is a local interest news reporter in Buffalo with dreams of the anchor seat.  Except his arch rival Evan Baxter (The Daily Show's Steve Carrell) looks to be next in line as the new head anchor.  When Bruce's boss Jack sends him out to cover a story, his dream job is given to Baxter and it sends Bruce into a hilarious tail-spin, which in the end, has him screaming out to God (Morgan Freeman) Spite Me. Instead God gives him a job.  Bruce gets to be God for the week, and the rest of the film answers the question what would you do if you were given all God's powers. Jim Carrey's screen persona has grown up, he can't go back to Ace Ventura, so his performance while bordering on brilliant, is reigned in. You almost wanted more from him, to kick up a notch, and it doesn't. Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is sweet and adequate, but she could have been played by anyone, and the scripts asks very little for her to do. Steve Carrell is great as bit player.  He's probably the funniest guy out there and his anchor desk sequence, is the funniest scene in the whole film. I just wish comedies didn't feel it necessary to be filled with mellow-drama.  I wish movies could be silly for silliness sake, but unfortunately BRUCE is full of those needless scenes of fake drama for filler.  Come on Guys. But hey in the end rest assured that BRUCE ALMIGHTY is well worth the price of admission.  By the way I always knew God was a Yankee Fan.",Null,0,0,28 May 2003
Munich," MUNICH is a powder keg
","MUNICH is a powder keg. It is a film that is so steeped in controversy not because of its content, but because of who made it. The most famous director in Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, has crafted a film that is so brave not because of its content but because of its point of view. This film is about Israel and it's ongoing conflict with the people of Palestine, and it doesn't paint a pretty picture of anyone involved.In 1972 thousands of athletes and spectators poured into Munich to celebrate and compete in another Olympics. All was well until 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage by a terrorist faction called Black September. All 11 men were killed. In its aftermath the Israeli government hired five Mosad agents to go undercover and kill the 11 men who were responsible.The film follows Avner (Eric Banner) the leader of this group on his mission to get revenge for the Munich Olympics. Avner is a regular guy placed in a position that at first seems justifiable. But as the body count gets higher and he finds himself justifying more and more killings, we the audience are left wondering if the ends really do justify the means. Were the Black September terrorists really evil and uncaring or were they men without voices trying to make somebody listen? Is revenge really the best weapon? Does killing those responsible end the real violence? MUNICH poses questions and leaves the audience to sort out the answers.MUNICH is not a film about the battle between good and evil. It's a film about evil fighting an even worse evil. It's about human futility and about how vengeance doesn't solve a problem it only makes it worse. It's about corrupt Nationalism and corrupt ideals that turn good people into monsters and the corrupt governments that penalize the monsters they've created. But at the heart its about the regular guys who are fighting turf wars with regular guys and how given the right circumstances we all have the potential to do evil masquerading as good.And yet trying to nail down the intentions of Munich is quite difficult. You certainly can't cheer Avner. He's no hero, but you also can't fault him for his outrage. His countrymen were killed senselessly, why shouldn't his people retaliate? Why shouldn't the terrorists pay for their sins? The major flaw and yet its strongest attribute it that it fails to take a side. It fails to define just what evil is. It allows the audience to watch from a distance and doesn't attempt to drown the audience in political correctness. But can these warring factions both be right? Is there ever an end? Where does America fit into the story? Does America's support of the state of Israel make us culpable? The film shies away from those answers (except in the final shot that speaks far more than any in this film). Is that a good thing? I don't really know, what I do know is that this is the kind of film that will put people on both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict on the defensive. If you think strongly one way or the other MUNICH will anger you.I applaud Spielberg for the brave choice of choosing an Israeli as the focal point of the story. If this had been about the Palestinians it would have been so easy (at least for me) to accept the Arab people as the villain and the Jewish people as victims. But at the end aren't both sides Victim's of each others misguided Nationalism? It's easy to paint terrorists as the evil party. But good and evil are never black and white and sometimes bad things happen on both sides. But revenge never gets us anywhere, and Munich shows us characters that are so normal becoming Monsters. They may be justified in their anger but are not helping the situation. This is a bold position to take.MUNICH is not a black and white film and it should be dissected. IT should be discussed and it should be a lesson to those who see the issues of Israel's right to exist, not as a black and white thing but as a problem that will only go away when both parties wake up and take responsibility for their hate and anger. The ongoing tensions in the middle east will not be solved by American guns but by the people of the middle east putting down the guns and asking for forgiveness from each other. Would that ever happen? Will the fighting ever end? Not until someone can fix the darkness in every human heart.Post-script: After writing this review I must say that the film MUNICH is inspired by actual events and that my comment are not meant to be skewed either right or left. The current problems in the Middle East are numerous and complicated and I myself only know very little. The above review are my thoughts after viewing the film MUNICH and not on the people of ISRAEL and/or PALESTINE. I believe they both have a right to exist and be defended, and I pray for peace in that region.",9,5,10,23 December 2005
V for Vendetta," V FOR VENDETTA is just sad.
","V FOR VENDETTA is pure drivel. I get that out of the way at the top of this review because I know it will not be the popular opinion. But at some point I've realized that I'm nobody if I'm not honest. So I'll say it right now, V FOR VENDETTA is not an action movie, it's a propaganda film. It's a film about how great anarchy is.About 50 or 70 years into the future Great Britain is run by a totalitarian dictator (John Hurt). Books, music, and all sorts of free expression are banned. The government has created a police state that keeps people in line. Then a shadowy masked figure named V (Hugo Weaving) steps out of the shadows and fights the government by exposing their corruption through terrorist actions. Buildings are blown up, television signals are stolen, and caught in the middle of it all is Evey (Natalie Portman). Evey, the reluctant student of the mysterious V, will play a pivotal role in overthrow of the government, whether she wants to or not.Now where do I start. On a purely cinematic level this movie is not very fluid. Most scenes revolve around characters talking about how horrible things are. They talk and talk and then talk some more. The screenplay is so verbose that any action you may have been expecting flashes by in seconds. V's origin is told and retold at least 4 different times and there is a subplot involving an actress that just goes on and on.As for the rest of the film, the best scene involves a humorous take on the government. It's bold and the man involved in the full on attack of the social order doesn't parade around in mask. He's bold because he puts his name and face out for the world too see. Yes he pays the consequences for his action, but he used the tools at hand to subvert the government. He didn't need bombs, he didn't need violence, he just needed to be socially disobedient.But V this movies hero hides behind a mask of platitudes and terrorist actions. He's too proud to put his face out there for the world to see. He's like a man who writes a manifesto about how horrible the world is and signs it with an alias. Who wants to listen to a coward. V believes that the only way to get people to listen is to blow things up and to murder the men in charge. But what then? Do you start another government? Does that one become corrupt? I know its not a popular idea but did you ever just think that maybe human beings are rotten to the core? That our hearts are dark? That if given the right circumstances we all could be Hitler? I know I've lied, I've stolen things, and I've hurt the people I love the most. I've even made my wife cry and I know there are people out there that think I'm a jerk. So I ask you am I good person? I strive to be, but the human condition drags me down.That's why we invent law. Whether it be moral law, or traffic law, laws are put in place to fight against the human condition. But Laws are so easily corrupted, from going 35 in a 25 miles per hour zone, or murdering your neighbor for his sneakers, we break laws because we are weak, selfish and at our cores we don't want anybody to tell us what to do.V operates in a place where humans are basically good except for those that disagree with him. Government and greed are the problems. He and those who agree with him are the ones who are right. Organized religion is wrong. Politics is wrong. If we can somehow get rid of them the world will be a better place. But alas isn't he himself turning his followers into robots? What if one of his followers challenged him? Would he be labeled a traitor? Would he be sent away? The final outcome of V FOR VENDETTA may seem helpful, but why replace one tyranny for another.I know I've gone off on a tangent here. I know my comments may make some people angry. But alas I live in America and for all the horrible things that are going wrong, I'm glad I can still thank God that I live in a country where many men and women strive to do what's right. I can question my government without having to resort to terrorist actions and where men and women can believe what they want. We are 'One Nation Under God', be it a Christian God, or a Muslim God, or Zeus the God Of War. My faith in America is not in the government. My freedom is not protected by George W. Bush or V the mysterious masked vigilante. It come from some place higher, some place stronger than myself. Terrorism breeds more terrorism. Anarchy breeds nothing but chaos and V FOR VENDETTA is a horrible education in hedonism and nihilism.Do you want change the world? It begins in the human heart. It begins when you strive to do good regardless of whether the Government is protecting you or not. It's means dying not for self, but for others and striving for truth and not empty platitudes. V FOR VENDETTA is about a coward, and that's just sad.",2,15,34,17 March 2006
