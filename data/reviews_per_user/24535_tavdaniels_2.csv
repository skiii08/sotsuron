The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Caught me totally off-guard
","I knew little about this film when I went to see it (or even that it was based on a book). I truly walked into it blind and was completely unprepared for the emotional roller coaster I was getting on.I'm starting to feel that the less you know about a movie going in, the better. Trailers give away too much and I think we pre-shape our opinions about things too easily by % on places like Rotten Tomatoes, etc. In any event, all that is to say I read and saw virtually nothing about this film before I saw it. So glad.It is one of the more honest and insightful films about young people coming of age that I have ever seen. It dealt with complex emotional and psychological issues with a tenderness and compassion that is singularly unique. It also is full of light and romantic moments as well.Don't want to give away too much, but I simply can't recommend this film highly enough.",9,0,2,25 January 2016
Once," A unique love story about something much deeper than romance alone
","From the rough and uncut opening image and the song being sung, it was clear this was a different kind of movie. So many love stories are about tired and overused clich√©s that focus on the most superficial forms of human relationships. This is light years from that.It's about two lonely souls connecting at a level that is far too rarely seen in films these days. Add to that a soundtrack that is full of passion and skill (not to mention an authentic Irish vibe that feels both immediate and vibrant) and it creates an experience that is truly life-affirming and life-giving.I've seen a few of the 'hater' reviews and it's like they were watching a different movie than I did. Just don't get it. To each, his/her own, I guess.",9,1,1,25 January 2016
