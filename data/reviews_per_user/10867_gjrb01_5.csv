The Avengers," Probably the 2nd Best Comic-Movie of All Time (SO FAR)
","Two Thumbs Up!!!Let me get this straight...*Acting/Characters - It was good and brilliant especially Mr. Starks. Gonna love to give him credit for making this film not just a Sci-Fi Action but also showered some great humor.*Effects - This factor is widely visible. Joss Whedon & Co. has a great vision. Unlike some transformers sound & visual effects, this film has greater eye catcher. *Story/Plot - Although the ending & climax scenes were as expected, the whole story & scripts were made you think it is flawlessly made simply because the whole story is simple; from the beginning of LOKI's plans of Mayhem and Assembling the Avengers.***OVERALL (8.7/10)it was Entertaining, Avery Well Executed Film!!! You get a double of the price you paid for. It was unbelievably amazing as good as 'The X-Men First Class' (maybe) last year and may contend for the second best comic book movie of all time next to 'The Dark Knight' (in my opinion), but we will see if TDKR of Nolan can top what he did last 2008.",8,2,6,30 April 2012
The Hunger Games," A brilliant story with just some loose in the execution
","Don't get me wrong Gary Ross is great! Let me put it this way; 'Dismissed a rated R violent book and cut it down to PG13 to make more money'. They stated before releasing the firm that it could be or will be the next Twilight Saga Movie (which of course this was much better than that series), which I believe thats the reason why this film could have been more better (it's all for the money).J. Lawrence is way too better than K. Stewart impact, she is the best suited for the role though the lead is only 16 year old girl - Katniss Everdeen. The first book of Suzanne Collins's prodigiously popular trilogy has been brought to the screen with a Jumbotron sensibility, a shaky camera to emphasize the action and a shakier grip on the subject's emotional core; which I do not prefer, could much have been better if slow motions slides were used rather than shaky ones; which makes it more intense. The concept is hardly an original one. Older audiences with a sense of movie history will recognize more than trace elements of 'The Most Dangerous Game,' 'Spartacus,' 'Battle Royale,' or 'The Running Man.' But 'The Hunger Games' wasn't intended for older audiences. the film does quite effectively bring to life many of the meticulously detailed elements of the books, often making them feel more accessible and understandable in the process. The look of the various Districts is true to its source, and the film's costume and make-up departments have managed to translate specific looks (from Katniss and Peeta in particular, to the colorful Capitol citizens at large) straight from the page to the screen. Moreover, while there has never been any doubt as to the depth and breadth of the Capitol's control over the proceedings, seeing the Games play out through Seneca Crane's central command center adds a new dimension to the tone of the game and the perception the Capitol. That control, combined with the overt division between what the other Districts have versus what the Capitol has (in terms of goods, services, technology, and quality of life) give us a striking villain to root against (made even better when the first seeds of a new revolution begin to sprout).Don't be hook to the rating of 8/10 it's not like it is better than The descendants or Drive or even X Men first Class last year, but overall solid acting; a stunning look and feel; an infectious energy and sense of engagement; stays true to the source material except in rare (and necessary instances); the introduction of a bold new world; totally moving and emotional.7.2 out of 10 stars",8,1,7,23 March 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Definitely is... Spider-Man is amazing
","Last year X-Men (First Class)reboot was very fantastic, and The Rise of the Planet Apes was also very good! This year, Marc Webb dared to begin another Spider-Man Franchise, and to my surprise; was amazingly done.Not as good as Batman Begins but is as good as last year X-Men: First Class.Fresh and old plot-lines were mixed up to gave the audience an exquisite story of old-brand new spidey hero. Again, heroism brand of spider-man focus on his relationship to his family, friends and peers, and of course our superhero is one-hell of a lover-boy; new love interest which an ingredient of fresh story and is a sample exploits an untold story which I think the major flaw of the movie because it doesn't elaborates the secret behind his parents death which I hope can be lighten to us the next spidey-movie.Overall, Andrew was great to replicate what Tobey done and Emma and other cast were good. The story maybe a shadow of the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Franchise but is still effective enough to let you bite. Action and web-slinging choreography and other visual effects were great even the background music, especially Coldplay's 'Till Kingdom Come' track.In case you were wondering how did I rate my favorite Comic Movies, here it is; (my opinion only)The Dark Knight - 10/10 Batman Begins - 9.5/10 Spiderman 2 - 9.0/10 Kick Ass - 8.9/10 X-Men First Class - 8.9/10 The Avengers - 8.6/10 The Amazing Spiderman - 8.6/10 X2 - 8.5/10 Iron Man - 8.5/10So far thats my Top 9 Comic Movie of all time. And I do hope The Dark Knight Rises can live to its reputation because I reserve a slot for it.",8,4,12,30 June 2012
The Bourne Legacy," great action & thrills., but a bit of a disappointment
","*Story/Plot/Content - B+ nice script still is Gilroy's hand manifest the whole story brought from the first to the third Bourne Series.*Production/Execution - B+great production like all Bourne movies,from one place to another especially great action feed from Manila, Philippines.*Acting - B+Jeremy has the same intensity as Matt has, great moves and instinct, but still I prefer Matt's approach with the movie and situations in the film.*Direction/Editing/Score - BGilroy's lack intensity that Greengrass has in his two sequel of Bourne Series. Same editing the scenes but the score is about as great as the last Bourne.*Entertainment/Enjoyable - Ahell yeah! it was enjoyable and entertaining. Adrenaline-punched all over especially in the climax scene.OVERALL - B+ 7.8/10",8,3,7,10 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A Near-Perfect MovieÂ…. (A Grand Cinematic Leissure)
","Not all critics hailed it as good as its immediate predecessor, but in all honesty TDKR is as good as The Dark Knight. Yes no one can match a truly magnificent performance by the late H. Ledger which make his last made film truly legendary and makes this last installment of Nolan's Batman really hard to finish and above all else TDK has put this last sequel on pedestal of everyone's eye, expecting higher than the usual but Hardy's performance as Bane make it big for this movie and of course Nolan's grand finale has its ground-breaking spectacular and non-stop nail-biting climax that would put you on the edge of your seat gripping till the last scene.The script was greatly made by the Nolan brothers. There were a lot of new cast which you would think they're irrelevant but evidently it was a necessity to the climax. The acting was superb especially Hardy, Bale, Gordon-Levitte,and Caine. The plot and story and directing was amazing and real, I don't know how Nolan's brain works but it is amazingly effective.TDKR is the very best finale sequel since LOTR: Return of the King. Of course it is way too better than the third sequel of Spider-Man, X-Men, Blade, even the third Star Wars.Overall TDKR is the best film of 2012 I've seen so far. It is definitely greater than to its competition. It has made The Avengers a child's play as said by TIME movie review. And definitely as great as The Dark Knight. Not all viewers will be pleased by this movie especially some critics, but in all honesty this is one of the greatest movie that has ever made (especially in our time).9.8/10",10,3,9,19 July 2012
