Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Jack Is Back.....
","I can imagine that many has been sitting with a feeling if the Pirates concept is going too far(Specially after POC nr.3) but thanks to a tight script this fourths installment of POC is definitely worth a watch.I personally didn't like the 3rd one cause of too much talk and confusion, but this one lives up to the first two.Jack Sparow and captain Barbosa are the scene stealer s, their chemistry is Top-Notch. Cruz and rest of the crew did very well.And thank god that Orlanda Bloom and that Skinny girl is not in the movie.Go for this movie, it got everything from comedy, action, adventure and the most important: Captain Jack Sparow.",8,73,141,16 May 2011

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Worth it....Or Not ?
","This movie is definitely worth a watch. Tom Cruise did it again and delivered an action pack movie once more.The Moscow scene was good, the Dubai scene was brilliant BUT the whole India scene in my opinion dragged the movie. And it didn't do much better to see Anil Kapoor make a clown out of himself in the 5 min. role he got.I would have rated the movie 9 but the India scene dragged the movie and killed the High Pase that the movie had built up.But still definitely worth a watch.Go For it Guys...Tom Cruise still have it.",10,2,7,16 December 2011
The Last Samurai," 10 out of 10..a Must See Movie
","Mr.Cruise did it again.I never doubted Tom Cruise acting skills, and the movies he pick to be part in. And this time he does it again. The Last Samurai is a higly recommended movie which has everything from Romance to Figts.I wont tell you about the storyline , but if you want to watch a very good movie then go watch this one, you cant be dissapointed.This movie is one of the best movies made in 2003 and dont miss it.It is always facinating to see old Japaneese culture and I hope to see more of these kind of movies, which can bring back some people's Honour and dignity that most has forgotten.",10,1,2,25 March 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Are we living in a Matrix...?
","The big question is..are we living in a Matrix world..?This is a question which can be discussed several times. What if all what we believe and all what we see is just a program.This can be true that we are a part of the Matrix, but this is a very deep thinking scenario and maybe I should just comment about the movie.Well the sequal of the Matrix trilogy is a well made and deep thinking movie, every effect is well studied and well made. The characters are very strong and the fight scenes are better than the first.I will recommend this movie to everyone and I gave this movie a top rating cause of its brilliant story.",10,0,0,16 June 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," The Hottest movie this Year,Absolutely Fabolous..!!!
","The Matrix was a good movie back in 1999, But Matrix Reloaded is even better than the first..all the action sequences are just amazing.Trinity looks even better and Morpheus is great.I must say that the end is a bit dissapointing but when you know that Revolution is on the track in just 6 months then you can live with it. I will recommend this movie to all..Its a must see movie on the big Screen.",10,0,0,24 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," X-traordinary
","I didnt like the fist movie that much, the effects was very nice but the movie was to Over-Hyped, But X2 it is a very good movie. The effects are very well done made and the star cast is good. And the ladies look even more Hot than ever. All in All I will recommend to watch this movie on the big screen. It sure is better than the first part.",9,1,3,3 May 2003
