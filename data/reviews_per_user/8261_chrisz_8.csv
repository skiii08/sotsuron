The Blair Witch Project," Chilling and Spooky
","It was something different. I heard alot of reviews, 50/50. I say it did the job for me, really not knowing what to expect, i was drawn into the whole blairwitch story. I even wondered after the movie if this is actual footage and are these people really missing. Then I read somewhere is wasn't. ******.5/**********",Null,0,1,30 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This Movie is a Phantom Menace
","As a big Starwars fan i can't help feel disappointed with this installment of the StarWars prequel., It lacks emotion character development and serious acting. Too comical for a Starwars film even if it was intended for kids. Apart from this and Jar Jar, and whats the deal with Boss Nass and his slobbering. Although Visual were stunning. The Saber duels at times were filmed to close. Altogether one Big Opppps!!",1,5,9,18 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This Movie is a real Phantom Menace, but entertaining as well

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What the hell is this
","I was so happy that this abomination of a movie won no Oscars...The Matrix was superb and deserved all 4...Over played effects took control over the lousy story...Jar Jar binks is a discrace as the Non-comic relief... Wooden acting by Anikan... What's with the OOOpps! In every scene he's in. The Queen is like a puppet held up with strings... Dth Maul is obvously most peoples fav character, so why was he in the film for 10 minutes only...Was George Lucas Jelous of his popularity... Everything in this movie was done to easy...Destroying the federation ship, pod race and those two headed fools",1,2,4,28 May 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What happened here
","I love watching this movie on video cause i can fast forward past Jar Jar. That really means 80 percent of the move then Ohhh No!
What a let down, i dont know how anyone could say the movie is great or brilliant, but then again everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Obviously aimed for the younger audiance in comic relief.How do you explain a full viewing audiance cheering the opening Lucas Logo when the film opened, and when the film ended not a sound except people in their seats just trying understand what had happend.Dont get me wrong, i love the trilogy. I thought Jedi was a little dodgy, but entertaining as well.Phantom Menace did not live up to expectations. I am not going to go into why i did not enjoy this film. I would like a Starwars film to be in the formate of Braveheart or Gladiator.",1,1,2,30 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I Have A Bad Feeling About This!
","After seeing the Midnight opening night screening at Highpoint Melbourne Australia I wished I Had not.I really wanted this movie to blow me away, but unfortunalty that non comic relief Binks ruined the movie of what it once was a Drama filled Starwars saga. Since Jedi Lucas has taken a backwards step in his movie making. This disney Crap of CGI in Phantom just hits rock bottom. Even though Binks had a big roll in Destroying this film, it is full of ditches and pot holes. I am not even going to bother explaining all of these. I will summarise1: Binks stinks ( heads the List)2: Viceroy Speech was really bad.3: Boss Nass and his Slobbering ( How Silly)4: Big Fish not once but twice5: Captain Panaka - We will be Siting Ducks6: Annie Skyawlker - Oppps every five Minutes, Happy go Lucky Pilot7: Pod Racing two headed fools.8: Jabba and that lovely sound when he starts the Pod Race9: Not enough Sith even if there is only a Master and an Apprentice10: The stupid Parade11: Battle driods (Roger Roger) Useless Sticks.12: Saber duel on Tatooine was filmed to close13: Space Battle was a huge dissapointment no excitmentIf EP2 is similar to EP1 in comic relief EP3 will be Viewed on video at someone else's house so my Electricity is not wasted.Considering George lucas's Tendency to Incorporate video game elements into his movies, I think there may be a scene in the next movie, involving Jar Jar, and resembling some sort of platform game... possibly 'Bobble Bubble'.* out of ***** and thats for the Maul/Obi-Wan duel which was the best Bit.",1,1,2,12 September 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," The Worst
","The movie would have to be my all time Worst. I was so disapointed I walked out on the movie towards the end. Come on a T-Rex roaming the streets, and that girl and her gymnastics routine to knock over one of the littler Mutts.I actually enjoyed the first Jarassic Park but this one is unconvincing with repeat scenes. I have banned this movie from ever viewing it again. Dont waste your electricity peoples",1,10,37,30 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Now, this is a movie
","Made almost 20 years ago this timeless classic holds its own as the best movie off all time. It's not hard to describe this movie, it has everything you want, Action, Romance, Drama, Fear, etc. The story is very well written and you are drawn into it right away. The Special Edition Rocks!!",10,1,3,29 August 1999
