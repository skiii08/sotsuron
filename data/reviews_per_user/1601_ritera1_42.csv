The Avengers," Eh?
","I don't get it.Not that it was a bad movie. It was fun. It was okay.But some surprisingly poor filmmaking. It doesn't help that I loathe hand-held camera. You spend all this money and then muddy up the shots with a hand-held? It's the cancer on the testicles of cinematography. Buy a dolly, or tripod or Steadicam.I'm just glad that I didn't see this in 3D (which is another head-scratcher for me). Stargate or Independence Day was shot better. Any Hong Kong action movie is shot better. Any Jackie Chan movie is shot better.The story was better than average. A good amount of very bad and stilted dialog, though. Loki's ulterior motive on being captured was amazingly transparent.Acting was generally good. I don't know if you call what Downey does as 'acting'. It's him being charming, which works most of the time. But Scarlette? A looker but not getting much better at her 'craft'.And I thought it was just silly to see her face-off with the alien invasion with a handgun.And did Hawkeye's arrows magically replenish themselves 3, 4, 5 times during the final battle? Hemmesworth will be a very good actor in ten years. But he's okay now. But too small to be Thor, though.And please! How was the final battle not a carbon copy of Transformers 3? I liked Serenity. And Cabin in the Woods. But I think Josh was in over his head on this.",7,6,14,24 May 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Yet again, QT is disappointing.
","I'm not quite sure how to grasp QT. Frankly, I think he's a very good director (and a so-so action director) and makes good choices when it comes to a DP, editing and music. The guy himself I think is a nut (not in a good way) and it shows in his writing.Both Kill Bills are soulless. This is a revenge story between one psychopath against a group of psychopaths. I do have to say that QT does write interesting individual scenes, his trademark. And he probably gets good actors 'cause they're fun to play. But at the same time they are original, but as original as mashed potatoes and chocolate syrup. They're tired clichÃ© characters repackaged with the QT brand, and that somehow is fresh?And those scenes in question. They're usually very colorful but also very trite. They rarely have an actual point.And QT doesn't know a thing about character development. Maybe that's his point, but he seems to write AROUND almost anything interesting that might come out of a story about these people. To give a comparison, the original The Crow is a very passionate revenge story about a character that you're invested in. But why do we like The Bride? 'cause she kicks ass? Who cares? I know NOTHING about this woman 'til the very end, when a weak excuse of how she SUDDENLY changed into a good guy when she found out she was pregnant.The only spark of character development was when Michael Madsen said 'she deserves her revenge.' Out of 4 hours? And this set-piece of action with the 88 at the restaurant. It was just a jumble of movements and gallons of blood. (I personally hate that wire stuff.) Even at his worst, a Jackie Chan movie has more rhythm and clarity to their action scenes than this. And even at its most corny and basic, a John Woo film has characters that you are invested in.I know I'm in the minority on this, but I just don't get it. No, this isn't about the violence. QT is the demigod of cinema, but what is he saying about anything? It's not that hard. Movies are suppose to be stories about characters. And then do whatever the bleep you want after that. But if it's about slick pretty people doing bloody things, any hack can give you THAT!",4,3,6,28 June 2009
Vertigo," Best Movie Ever?
","Maybe it's generational. Maybe it's politics. Maybe it's misplaced reverence.It was very good but reasonably dated. Clearly a clinic on how to structure a movie. And how to shoot a movie, albeit basic shots. But I saw the reveal a mile away. I knew it was a con. The chemistry between Stewart and Novak was good, but very melodramatic. And their leap to 'love' was ham-fisted and clunky. Probably 'cause of when it was made.And what Novak did was pretty serious. I don't know how you like a character after that. And why would the bad guy just leave the loose-end of Novak in SF? If he's got the drive to kill his wife, then why not Novak?And if Novak loved Steward so much, she didn't try to re-connect or see him?I liked what Hitchcock did with Stewart's obsession but bordered on over-acting. It did breath more than movies of today. At over two hours it didn't seem that slow. Today they want to get audiences in and out for more showings. I wouldn't say an 8 out of 10. 7.8. It had all the markings of solid movie without the spark some films have (but with more flaws). But again, I think I'm suffering from a generational disconnect.",7,0,6,19 August 2012
Men in Black 3," Oh I don't know
","I can and can't see some of the choices made in this.First off, it's not for me. I can see why people like it and why they made a 3rd one. But I didn't like the cartoon aspect of it.I have to say this was the best 3D that I've seen by far (Sony Digital). It's still not worth the extra $3 but this was very good vs. the crappy 3D I've seen in the past.Production values were first rate. Tommy Lee Jones was in good form. And, for some reason, I really liked the actor playing Griffin (who saw the future). Boris was good. Story was okay but am getting tired of alien invasions from the past couple years. Apparently I have been vastly outvoted by the general public for the past twenty years, but I am not a fan of Will Smith. Just don't like him. I like James Brolin but I thought he was poor in this. Even with the joke of 'city miles', I could not buy him as a 29-year-old.And the jokes. Most were bad and stale. A couple good ones but few and far between. They started a joke about a black man in 1969 but didn't do anything with it for the 2nd half of the movie. And on top of it they tried to sell me an African-American Colonial in 1969 without a second look (vs. bigotry at that time). I know they needed it for the story, but really!?Another side element was that Will Smith couldn't be close to James Brolin. Why? I dunno. But it was a warning. Then it was forgotten. Voila!But, all in all, better than I expected.",7,1,4,2 June 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," Very nicely done!!
","Can't really pick out anything poor in this.Goodman's character was a bit of a departure for him. I guess the closest would be Hudsucker Proxy. He's a off-kilter jerk, not sure where he's coming from. He looks the part of a kidnapping weirdo, which initially disappointed me for being cliché. Then after all the drama, he turns into a likable dad who just went overboard after the end of the world. Finally at the end he's...we're not really sure. It wasn't cliché. Was he a pervert? Did he kidnap the girl as a daughter surrogate? Did he even kill the girl?I did think that not telling the female lead that it was the end of the world was a device to add conflict and departed from what Goodman's character would have done. But that's forgivable. All in all, I'd nominate him for an Oscar, maybe in Supporting. Not sure if he should win, though.I'm not quite sure that they played enough with the element of if it really was the end of the world or not. The diseased woman on the other side of the hatch was good, and the supposed cars/helicopters (actually aliens in the end) was good. But---I felt a bit was missing.Nice scene with the man/woman doing their monologues about their past. Very well done and was a springboard for subsequent turns. I think I was expecting it not to be the end of the world once the girl escaped, but it was better that it was. It was a quick turn from the tone previously, but provided a solid 15 minute ending. And her arch was nice when she previously established that she runs when things are tough. But at the literal fork in the road, she chooses to drive toward the war. Very highly recommended.",9,0,2,6 June 2016
The Expendables 2," I liked it...what else is there to say?
","Apparently I have to qualify my reasoning for IMDb but, like french fries or a piece of cake, there ain't too much to say about it.Hit the right notes. Actually found dollies and tripods for the cameras and I could easily make-out what was happening in the scenes. That alone deserves five points compared to other action movies that spend 100 million dollars and shoot the fights with hand-held. Stupid!There were problems, sure, but they were enjoyable problems. Arnold is an even worse actor in this than he is in anything else. Same for Chuck Norris. Both sounded like they were readin' off cue cards. And Chuck didn't even punch or kick anybody! What the heck! Good to know that he came out of the conspiracy cave tellin' everyone how much a threat Obama is to do it, though.The 'rest in pieces' line from Stallone was bad. Just bad. Shame on you, Sly.And shame on you Jet for literally bailin' out of the plane and the movie so early. I was sure that you'd rescue everyone in the cave in. But NO. You left it to Arnold.I think I know the answer to this question, but does any character ever suffer from PTSD?Now come on. I think everyone knows that Stallone could never really beat Van Damme on Jean Claude's worst day and Sly's best.And I think you'd better ramp-up the production of E3 very fast. Most of these guys are probably gonna be fitted with walkers any day now.",8,0,0,23 November 2012
Rocketman," Competent filmmaking. Nothing new.
","It filled a market after Bohemian Rhapsody. Essentially was a showcase for the music mixed in with some elements of his story LOOSELY interpreted. But that's the nature of these 'Based on a True Story' things. Sure, the changes serve the story in a demanding medium, but they are still false stories.Egerton was energetic and enthusiastic but was not really given much to work with. The rest of the cast were likely very good actors but were not able to fire up the screen. Madden was effective as the bad guy, though. And Bryce Dallas Howard is a good lookin' woman even when they put some pounds on her.The direction was by-the-numbers with the big venues falling flat from unimpressive CG. It seem to take a lighthearted tone, although lighthearted is not what you'd call substance abuse. Apparently Elton John didn't want it to be PG-13, but I felt like it was in that ballpark.The father elements were very ham-fisted and kind of melodramatic.If you miss it, you're not missing much.",7,1,1,29 November 2019
Argo," Even though it's not accurate....
","Affleck should win Best Director. I couldn't catch any flaws in the film making and there was a great deal of detail in the cinematography.I might even nominate him for Best Actor. Would he win? No. But it was a nice, understated performance.The manufactured parts of the story were obvious, though, even before I went home and checked the accuracy of the story. The previews give away the ending (which never happened). Apparently the trip through the airport was uneventful in real life. And the bus driver grinding the gears to ratchet up the tension? Come on! When Carter cancels the operation, I knew that didn't happen. It was dramatically valid and worked well, though.Even though Affleck, like me, is a big ol' liberal, I've just about had enough of cliché portrayals of Middle Eastern people. The only redeeming Middle East character was the housekeeper. Enough already.Thus, for me the Best Picture contenders are Argo, The Master, Damsels in Distress, and Moonrise Kingdom. A weak list this year. Moonrise Kingdom was the most enjoyable of all but had problems. Argo had no problems but wasn't quite there as an overwhelming experience. The Master was technically good but redundant. And Damsels in Distress was almost as good as Moonrise Kingdom.",9,2,4,5 November 2012
Ted," Hangover 2 laughs?
","No. A good try. 80% there. But Hangover 2 was overwhelmingly funny (with lackluster filmmaking). This was very funny (and better filmmaking).But a much better story. Despite all the crass humor, the characters were endearing. And like Family Guy and American Dad, it was consistently colorful and original. (Unless you're a prude or conservative, I never understood not liking Seth McFarlane.)The things that surprised me were the periodic dud jokes in the sea of very good laughs. For those 1-2 seconds there were no laughs in the theater. And the other were the periodic 2-3 seconds that nothing was going on. And that's a long time when you consider 'screen time'.And the absence of music, especially in the first half (but much more in the 2nd). For the overuse of music in Family Guy and American Dad, it was very noticeable.It did wander a bit, too. Felt too long. I thought the Walberg character was too old. I would have preferred the character to be in his late 20s. Would have made more sense and his actions more acceptable. But he was very good. Versatile.I've never been on the Mila Kunis bandwagon. She's far out of my league but nothing special in the sea of hot gals. Better actress than Scarlett Johannsen and Jessica Alba, but still average at best.Joel McHale was wasted. Ribisi was good, as always. And good for you Ryan Reynolds. Even when you don't say anything, you're funny.But, all in all, a very good time. I'd err on the side of see it now. Don't wait 'til DVD.",8,1,5,7 July 2012
Knives Out," Very fun and original. (Don't read if you've not seen.)
","Some great talent and good jobs done across the board.This is a genre that's been done before. Many genres done before. Never felt it so obvious and agitating than when I saw 'The Irishman.' And I felt it with this, although it didn't bother me so much.The characters have been seen before in very close proximity to these. Almost cliche. But real people across the board are repetitive and cliche, too.One element bothered me, though. The blood test of the corpse. I know these characters are under pressure and don't think straight. But I'm not under pressure and I see these things when they come up.The be-all and end-all of the blood work getting out didn't rest with that one sheet of paper. They could be done again. They were likely in a database. Now these characters might not have thought of that. But it's true.And then the nurse Marta is confronted by Chris Evans to tell the truth or she will vomit. 'So tell me.' Logic would dictate that she would then say nothing as she was not under any obligation to say anything, even for optics like in the initial interviews. But she did.And the final scene's PAYOFF was very good...but the set-up made little sense. Specifically when Chris Evans went after Marta and plunged the knife into her chest...but with a retractable blade.Very funny! But why would that art piece of many knives have a retractable blade? And most of the knives on it clearly were not such due to the shapes.But very enjoyable nonetheless. Hope you're reading this AFTER you've seen it, though.",9,0,2,16 December 2019
The Irishman," Been there, done that.
","It's not to say that the acual film wasn't impressively assembled and acted.But it really screamed that I'd seen all this before. Many times.Sure, genres do repeat themselves several times. But not as succinctly as here.Within the many engaging vignettes, there really wasn't a driving force in the very long 3.5 hours. Amusing to see brain-dead mobsters talk all that brain-dead mobster stuff. But been done to death: Suits. Cussing. Killing each other. Got it. No insight into that horrid lifestyle. The effects of such, but nothing how they could consider it the norm.The de-aging was not as bad as I expected and heard of. But it wasn't impressive. Looks very animated and didn't get deNiro down under looking 45, even when he was suppose to be in his 20s. Seems like it'd make more sense to use deep fake with images of deNiro young. Not like there's ain't plenty. The message was that deNiro was used to killing in WWII, but was only depicted in one quick scene. (And why'd he have the two Germans get out of the hole when they'd be in there anyway?)If you must, be very aware of the 3.5 hours, as it feels like 3.5 hours.And this also brings up the perplexing state of affairs at Netflix. They're $12 billion in debt and think that sinking $159M into this will make them money? Prestige? I'm lost.",7,8,19,12 November 2019
Deadpool 2," Very funny and great action.
","Not going to belabor this as there was very little to quibble about.To be a wet blanket, not a fan of heroes risking innocent lives. Sure, looks great in the truck chase, but a negative to me that nobody else will think of. Also risking lives just to save the one life of the teenager was part of that. Yes, of course that is the Deadpool character, except those scenes where he's acting human contradicts such.Ryan Reynolds being Ryan Reynolds is always fun.But very creative and funny throughout. I've heard that since Disney bought 20th Century, the violence of Deadpool doesn't fit into their image and another one likely will not be made. That is a big shame. (Update: 3 is happening.)",9,3,4,12 August 2019
The Hateful Eight," Strong but self indulgent
","Tarantino has always seemed like a good B-movie director. He learned from them and emulates them. There are better ones, though, who color within the lines. Granted, he has some flair in his dialogue (and scenarios) as a writer, but in the world of linear storytelling, it gets to be cumbersome and self-indulgent. But my view has always been in the vast minority.Somewhere along the line, he was elevated to deity and I don't understand it. And it has created an egomaniac. That is shown from the credits that announce that this is 'The 8th Film by Quentin Tarantino'. O-kay? I fully enjoyed Django Unchained as it seemed more focused on the justified murderous aspirations of its lead. The self-serving acting pauses were in line with the story-line. Same with Jackie Brown, which came from material not written directly by Tarantino.Hateful Eight was not serving the audience, though. The first hour was just two very bloated scenes of men who wanted to get on the stagecoach. And that dumb Lincoln letter. Very forgettable. The next hour was supposedly a thriller on finding out who is the bad guy. Very hyper-extended but done well. The third hour was how the bad guys were going to take over the cabin. We know what was going to happen. It was just a matter of when. Just more colorful characters saying nothing.And the characters were not remarkable, except for Jennifer Jason Leigh. There was not enough in the writing to credit Tarantino for that, either. It was her. But the rest? Just recycled hard-nosed cowboys we've seen before, although done a bit better than the rest. Beating up on Leigh had no real coherence, just illogical Tarantino blood-letting.It could have all been done in 100 minutes. He apparently drew from John Carpenter's The Thing, a vastly superior film. Tarantino should have paid more attention to that.And I didn't see the great publicity about it being shot in Ultra Panavision 70. Who cares? There was not enough to warrant any of that. It was essentially in one room. The exterior stuff was okay, but nothing spectacular.",7,1,2,31 July 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A great deal of holes in the web
","Generally entertaining but suffered from a lot of stupid to move the story along.No real urgency and threat, by and large. Just a loose conglomeration of pieces about this kid who wants to be a big-shot super hero tied with his love for the hot girl in school. No ticking clock. Good for them for not putting the world in peril for the 1000th time, though.When I realized the 'Homecoming' in the title was the homecoming dance at Peter's high school, I was ashamed for the film.The action pieces were very good and nuanced. I think Hollywood finally wised up on using hand-held camera and everything was clear and my eye could follow it.I really didn't think it was funny. More amusing. Holland's Peter Parker got agitating after awhile as I didn't believe he was 15. He was trying too hard. Keaton was a waste and was just hamming it up.What was a disaster was the plot. It was a series of vague incidents that relied heavily on Downey and Favreau ignoring Parker's warnings and not communicating with him. Thus, they ended up with egg on their faces and were very much out of character in their stupidity.If Spiderman was so important to Iron Man/Tony Stark, he wouldn't just have a few guys track him 24/7 via drone? Not like they didn't have the tech for such a task.The element of Keaton selling high-tech weapons to street criminals made no sense to me. If you want to keep a low profile, those are not the ones you'd sell to. Besides, they wouldn't have the money for it. Spiderman got info from one of the street criminal 'customers' who knew far more than he should and was driving an old Ford Taurus with the back window a piece of plastic tarp.The film said '8 years later' after Keaton is kicked off the salvage job. He would not have developed better contacts to bigger criminals to sell the weapons to?Why would you do a deal on a ferry in the middle of the water? Would that not be MORE of a risk? Granted, they needed the ferry for the action scene. But it doesn't erase the stupid move by the bad guy.And they had Keaton on video BEFORE Parker encounters him at the house when he picks up his date. The Tony Stark facial recognition software could not find him on a DMV record?I was also vague to what extent Keaton was stealing from the government and how easily he did.And that finale with the plane? Are you kidding me? Keaton sneaks onto it in the 'blind zone'? No cameras or motion sensors on that plane. Give me a break. I thought it all might be an elaborate stunt by Tony Stark to test Spiderman because it was so incredibly stupid. But no. It was just stupid.",7,1,1,23 November 2017
Alien," This guy should have directed Prometheus
","What? It's the same guy? Can't be! The only reason I went back to Alien is 'cause I just saw Prometheus. You know. The one that is supposedly not a prequel to Alien but is nothing but that.I think the problem with Ridley Scott is that he was able to get his teeth into the script process in his latter films. I would have to imagine that he was controlled and was far away from the screenplay for Alien, since this is far better than Prometheus.Unlike the latter, I liked and was invested in the characters of Alien. I couldn't figure out why 'cause the presentation of such was so similar. Then I realized that it was 'cause they were workin' class people. The title card says it's a mining vessel. My mind then made the connection due to real life and past caricatures. Then the quality acting helped, too.And characters were the main problem in Prometheus. Ill-defined and vague. I didn't care. (The mohawk guy was portrayed as a no-nonsense in-it-for-the-money guy. That's the blueprints for a mercenary or gun for hire. Not a geologist.) I miss the sci-fi of the 70s and 80s. Sure, the computer graphics were silly compared to today. Along with all the blinking lights that obviously had no purpose. But the models had dimension and the shooting style had grit. And story was king.The best part of Alien is that it could breath. Slow and steady but it all had a purpose and was interesting. But then dozens and dozens of horror movies took that as 'kill time for 45-minutes and then start the movie'.Then someone thought they could second-guess the process and invited the marketing guys to the table. What a bad decision!",Null,3,5,25 June 2012
Doctor Strange," Enjoyable except poor direction.
","A good chunk of positive elements, especially visual. The twisting landscapes were new and exciting (even though were done in Inception). Especially the chase in the middle, which was balanced and flowed well, despite a demanding visual requirement.The performances were not really demanding but were well served by a slew of very good actors.Writing was a bit better than the regular Marvel fare (Captain America the exception). The metaphysical element were simply defined and accessible, by and large. It was a bit complicated at times but I assumed the benefit of the doubt. I don't think the time loop at the end worked very well. Clunkly.Was disappointed with Scott Derrickson's direction. Thought several instances of detail and artistry were missed. Despite the chases being very good, the actual fight scenes were quite poor. American cinema, and especially Marvel movies, have a habit of making the combat vague and confusing with a shaky camera. This was the case here, plus 20%.Additionally, disappointed with the lack of conflict with the first half, despite the fact that it was heavy with conflict in the 2nd. Somewhat called for a slow start but still felt antsy, even though it did have the pending threat of Mads Mikkelsen's bad guy at the front.In the end, Strange's arc was convincing and effective. Didn't care for Chiwetel Ejiofor's turn to a bad guy at the end. Too much by-the-numbers and sudden.",7,1,1,12 February 2017
Nightcrawler," Astounding Performance
","Just about everything great about this film.It's been said a 1000 times but Gyllenhaal shows he's a masterful actor. Now he had some very good material to work from but this is one of the rare times that the performance exceeded what was written. Completely original and masterful. Should have won the Oscar.(Doesn't help the actor playing his assistant, who was also very good but was overshadowed.)The element that bothered me was the perfect storm to launch the character's success. Realistically most news outlets don't do blatant blood as depicted in this film. But the character easily finds the perfect outlet for his work in Rene Russo's character. But once that was realized, the story was engaging and fascinating.",9,0,0,24 November 2015
Bird Box," Gently but consistently fails throughout.
","I would imagine it was very much a money grab to take advantage of the zombie craze. The concept was a decent variation on the theme of such, but it soon stopped there. I've seen post-apocalypse done much better but even those were flawed.Two very incomplete and short movies mixed together (part 1 and 2) that were very much entrenched in B-movie devices to satisfy a perceived need vs. having any creative conclusion. And it was just so very damn long. Despite the fact that the short version failed, I would have been interested in trying it as a far longer mini-series to explore the subject.I am disappointed in Bullock's decision to do this, as she was also attached as a producer. Granted, I know that Hollywood has a phobia of older women, which is shameful. But this is Sandra Bullock, who had led many fine movies and always does a good job. But she had very little to work with and got lost in an acceptable but not remarkable ensemble. She delivered urgency and emotion when she had the chance, sure. But I wanted more from our 'hero' who was far more dominant in the 2nd portion than the first.Or was this a failed attempt to introduce an older woman as a 'hero' of an action movie? I am all for that, sure, although I am a male in his 50s. There were element to fuel interest in the female demographic, especially considering the attraction from women to violent material like Walking Dead and Game of Thrones. But we introduce Bullock as an ambivilant soon-to-be mother and then drop that 'til the very last scene when she gives the children names and calls herself mother. She steps up as a hero, but not from a great jump. But many times she is usurped and does play the female-in-distress role.What also added to my theory that it was geared towards a female audience was the casting of Trevante Rhodes as Tom, the love interest. I don't have any real issue with it but thought it was a cheap device to entice women as he was a much younger handsome black man. Did a fine job as an actor, too, for what he was given.I found interesting the concept that mentally ill people welcomed the sight of the 'monsters.' But relatively little was done with it. And John Malkovich's arc was satisfactory when he sacrificed himself for the children.The direction was very pedestrian, though. The scene of havoc before they were in the house was workable but not memorable. I guess we are also transitioning in film from real effects to computer-generated effects (explosions, fire, blood, etc) and it's not looking that good.I've heard Netflix bragging about great viewing numbers. That this was a high-profile tentpole movie for them vs. the filler they often offer. But it was very much an unremarkable B-movie.",5,3,7,7 January 2019
Silver Linings Playbook," Wonderfully done.
","A quirky and charming love story.I don't want to tread over often said compliments. It's been said.Despite her age, Lawrence easily pulled off a character much older than herself.Cooper was in fine form with energy and nuance.I would easily give them both the Oscar based on what I've seen this year, although the Oscars are silly but a decent marker for conversation. (Everyone else was very good, too, except for the brother. That role fell flat.)Direction was very good. This is probably the only film in memory that I can say hand-held camera was preferred to dolly or tripod shots. There's really not much you can do when it comes to talking heads, though. Some interesting editing in parts that added to the visuals.Seemed to coast for awhile, though. Was more of the same in many scenes, although that 'same' was very good banter. But little variation, too.The transition to the dancing was matter-of-fact. Not quite sure how exactly but that was my gut feeling.The end was too conventional, too. Predictable.",9,1,10,23 December 2012
Get Out," Although well directed and acted, that doesn't matter if the
","Reveal isn't solid. And it wasn't.(I should preface this with me being a white man in his 50, albeit a ultra liberal.)And with this, it's all about just waiting around for the reveal. It was paced and acted well but pedestrian in the writing and character development.And why? Why all this front-end crap for something that could have been done with a simple kidnapping? It was just an extended creepfest without the slightest sense of purpose in the end (except the very vague 'auction').You know. A kidnapping. Like they had at the beginning of the film. Why was it so important to string out the middle act if that was a clear and very easy option?And in that, it made no sense. Not even economic sense. If there were so many potential 'customers' at the party, why not just kidnap and make more money?Why would the daughter Rose go through what was apparently four months of a relationship with the lead Chris just to have him as fodder for the psychotic white doctor and, conveniently, the psychotic family members? Kidnapping would have done the same. It was the height of sociopathic for the whole family being that she was constantly having sex with men she didn't care for.And the other glaring omission. Why him? He was a good guy, sure. But like the other example of someone taking over a young man's body, the character of the person being invaded made no difference. It was never defined (nor attempted) why Chris was 'special.' And if it did, why would anyone choose to take over the body of a smoker?Additionally, the mechanics of Rose having all these relationships would call for her to have contact with men that lived a safe distance from each other to avoid detection. Thus, more reason to just kidnap.The element of social media would greatly increase leaving evidence behind in the form of photos of the men with Rose.I finally realized that the day party to observe Chris was an auction for his body. Not like it could have been more vague. But even still the whole procedure was about transferring conscious and nothing about the character of the victim. Even the desire to have Chris' 'eyes' made no sense as his eyes would not have given the recipient any creative advantage. Just rhetoric that sounded good.It was about youth and vitality, which played into the fears of the perspective black audience, but I didn't buy that old whites would want to be transferred into such (without explanation that a film did not have latitude for). There were too many societal and personal blocks to white people consistently wanting to take over the bodies of blacks.Grandma's and grampa's 'act' was vastly played up as a cheap device to create suspicion and likely bore no relevance to the characters displayed in the 'holding cell' video. The one instance we saw grampa in the video in the end was no explanation of their erratic behavior. Quite the opposite.Chris' cell phone cut out when talking with his best friend. Was suggested that it was just the battery, but nothing suggested the battery was low.And the elements of the finale were just plain dumb:So Chris' attention is unavoidably directed toward a small closet with the door open. He HAD TO LOOK INSIDE! (Suggesting that it was left there to be found.) In it, there is a red box with all the photos of the other black men that Rose had lured to their demise. Looked great but...why was it there other than to quickly clarify a story element? None. Absolutely none.I don't think you could hook up video to such an old television in the 'holding cell.'The cotton in the ears was clever but why did he remove such other than to clarify the cotton was there? That's to say they didn't have continual video surveillance (although with the intercom that was stated), being that they started the videos when Chris woke up.The operating room was the most unsanitary one in recent film memory. A box full of medical knives in a red felt-lined box looks good, but hardly realistic.What was the procedure? Was there a device in the white patient's head that collected the conscious, which then was transferred into the black person's brain? Very vague and never defined. Not even cursory.Seems very premature for Chris to kill the father other than the opportunity of violence.Despite the many deleted scenes on the DVD extras, they never explained how the best friend found Chris. But probably something very simple related to his cell phone that the 'bad guys' didn't think about.And what was made of Chris' smoking? Zero. Zilch.But in the end, they did extremely well vs. the budget, which negates anything I have to say. But for me it failed creatively and analytically in the execution.",3,0,2,22 December 2017
Logan," Much better than expected
","I had read that they pushed this one into the R-rated zone due to the success of Deadpool and the brutality it had. A very good choice, although a very different movie. (The Deadpool short that was before this I found very strange and fell flat. Not very superhero-esque.)But back to Logan.What stood out to me was the acting. I personally would put Jackman (lead actor) and Stewart (supporting) up for Oscars. Some very nice work from both, although the material gave them that opportunity. Both parts (especially Jackman's) were significantly physical and required displaying intense pain (and succeeded where DeCaprio's portrayal in The Revenant didn't come close. But to me that was more an overdue Oscar for him vs. an actual valid win.) The little girl was even very effective. The pairing of both her and Jackman was highly-touted but really didn't come into play until very late in the film, when they had the argument in the stolen truck after she takes him to the doctor.The dark turn in this was refreshing vs. the previous sanitized versions of Wolverine in the past. Gritty and mean. Captured damaged characters well, although didn't give them a backstory about why they were like that.(The element of the Nurse being killed was odd. The young bad guy thought Logan had killed her, and vice versa. But they never assigned blame.)The purpose of the journey was lacking, though. Very vague on how the Eden location came to be. It was a bit odd that they introduced the supposed red-herring of it being from a comic book and then it actually being real. (We repeatedly saw the coordinates of the location but they never used them in actually finding it.) And no explanation why 'crossing the border' was a cure-all to all their ills. No reason why the bad guys would give up after that and why they would not just chase them into Canada.Didn't find the direction that significant. The brutality of the action was much needed but then the action became muddled when the baddies kept missing the girl when they shot at her and bullet holes appeared in the limo in the following scene, not at that moment. The scene at the hotel when Xavier had his seizure was vague as it seemed that not all the patrons were frozen. Didn't care either for the car strippers in the initial scene being hispanic. I would have err'd on the side of political correctness and made them white. Wouldn't have made a difference in the end product. The presence of a wall between the US and Mexico was an interesting turn. Probably inserted when Trump's nonsense came up in '16.But, in the end, I found it very effective, despite its shortcomings.",9,3,9,24 May 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Better than the first
","A strong 7, although it was a bit too esoteric erring on the Christopher Nolan Batman side.Some very good and strong action vs. the first. A lot less hand-held camera. I could actually see what was going on. The opening was very fluid although the actual characters looked very much animated. Like a video game. I was consistently engaged with the action.A big film, too which was, at times, juxtaposed with being very small (the finale in the small building and the bridge). Even the farmhouse felt cinematic. The other locations not so much.But the story was familiar. Bad guy wants to end the world. They were stretching Ultron's lapsed logic from birth but it still worked. Jarvis to Vision was fine. Hulk and Black Widow romance seemed by-the-numbers and familiar. I know I'm going to be a broken record but Spader stood out. OK acting from everyone else, even Johansson (which is a big improvement for her). The big problem I had was The Avengers put an end to Hydra's work at the castle. But then they left it completely unguarded. Sure, there was no movie without some place for Ultron to escape to and build his army. But it was impossible to ignore. Also, it sure seemed that Ultron's army was very poorly constructed. All in all entertaining due to very high production values. But nothing that captured the imagination. Winter Soldier was a better film.(But really? Hawkeye? Why? He never runs out of arrows and, well, his weapon is arrows. Arrows?)",7,2,5,14 May 2015
Into the Wild," Give me a break!
","I cannot understand the praise for this stinker. If I was a Republican, I'd tell my kids and my teenage gay lover (they all have one) that this will happen to you if you're a hippie.Don't get me wrong. I'm a tree hugger. A lot of positive and good ideas and concepts in this film. But it's obvious that this guy was bat-poop nuts. The character was played as sane, but there is no chance he was in real life. Nevermind that he was critically selfish for what he did to his family and sister, regardless of the situation. If he wanted to contribute, there were a lot more sane ways to do it.It really took the life out of any anti-society argument.But to focus on the film I was shocked that Sean Penn couldn't do a better job with this kid's acting. Generally it was passable but then there were some very bad scenes, like he was reading off cue cards for the first time. Some nice camera work but nothing really remarkable about the rest of the direction. And it was WAY TOO LONG. Very self-serving of Senor Penn.(Also, anybody know that there was a rope bridge 1/4 mile down from this bus? Most locals apparently thought this kid was a fool.) For all the kids that would like to go on a similar journey of self-discovery: DON'T! There is something worse than a winter in that bus: watching this movie.",1,158,272,25 October 2007
La La Land," An achievement in directing
","Not quite sure about script, which felt very familiar and by-the- numbers.But the artistry was there. The opening was dazzling and energetic. (Being that I do live in Los Angeles, saw the failings in such as one line of cars was facing the wrong way with a concrete barrier in between. Also, despite being a traffic jam, the surrounding freeways were very clear, which is not typical other than early morning on the weekend.)The subsequent numbers were also enjoyable and colorful. The music solid (although I should have watched it with earphones).The performances were very good but would come short of saying they were Oscar worthy. There wasn't a range of emotions with Stone to warrant it. Although Gosling ends up being effective and a great screen presence, I generally find his actual performances somewhat cold. But kudos to him learning the piano for the role. It was an effective element.But, in the end, the story was very textbook. Traditional love story between two who were at first opposites. It did try to break the mold with them not being together in the end, but fell short and provoked more questions than satisfaction. Then the 'alternate ending' (which I more thought was a 'what if' from the Gosling character) was colorful.",8,4,8,11 February 2017
Don't Breathe," Extremely strong and effective
","Reminiscent of essential John Carpenter. Set up strong and clear characters, an urgent goal and then go crazy for an hour.Think Assault on Precinct 13, Prince of Darkness and especially Wes Craven's The People Under The Stairs.And everything was so simple. Although it was very digestible, there was a bit too much of a perfect storm to it all. Not having any other residents around was a bit much for me. I guess it's a staple where the security guard or cop shows up in the middle and is sent away. But logic demanded that.And was a bit confused why there was a million dollars instead of the $300,000. But the cat and mouse was stellar. It didn't let up. I had to step back, though, and think how even a clever and strong blind man initially kidnapped the girl who killed his daughter. And the scenario of him impregnating her was horrific and original. And his initial anger at accidentally killing her was baffling. I didn't see the reveal coming. I was disappointed in the director's reboot of Evil Dead in 2013. But this made up for it in spades. Being that it made a boatload of cash, I would assume it will have a sequel. But that's going to be a big challenge to get a blind bad guy to be effective out of his element.",9,1,5,5 December 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Much better than the first one
","A lot of stuff that you've seen very much before, including saving the universe yet again that bore a striking resemblance to the end of Dr. Strange. But eh, I paid $1.75.Not that Marvel or DC is listening to me, but gets very redundant that not just the Earth but the universe is saved about every six months.Very good on humor, pace, story, and characters. Dave Bautista's Dax has improved tremendously and was the best of them all. Rocket was entertaining and Zoe Saldana was serviceable. Kurt Russel was good. I'm still baffled why Vin Diesel is top billed for three words, over and over. Not like he's questioning such a big paycheck for nothing.But I don't get Chris Pratt. He's not bad but the role needs a Harrison Ford and he ain't it. Dax Sheppard is much closer, though, but still not perfect.A lot of good writing and humor. Absurd story line but actually worked. Lapses of opportunities in the direction. Missed several of those 'moments.' Great opening.Some really good visuals along with some pretty poor visuals (in the backstory of Ego and those bad mannequins). The spaceship stuff was good. The Ego planet was a bit colorful and the ending had a series of cheap-looking shots.",8,4,6,18 September 2017
The Shape of Water," Interesting---but---
","Well acted, directed and looked great. Interesting and likeable characters. Intriguing premise.But I've had a love/meh relationship with del Toro films. I'm more a Hellboy and Blade II fan. Pacific Rim was forgettable.This had the resonance of Pan's Labrynth as I wanted to like it, but ended-up disappointed. Largely due to the mechanics and logistics of the story elements. This facility had terrible security across the board. Cameras everywhere except that lab? Cleaning crews can go anywhere? The Russian scientist spy was in the shadows several times?Things that look great if you forget the common sense of such. Many times movies will take a 'leap of faith' in the story elements in order to move the train along. But there were far too many in this.The love story fell flat early on as I only felt it after the creature was taken to the apartment. Filling the bathroom with water looked very good but ended up being a very silly act.Even the initial introduction of the creature in the tank behind the woman was farted out. You let the audience see the creature right when the woman does in order the accentuate the shock factor.It was a bad decision for the creature to eat the cat. That made it an animal and mitigated compassion for it. Strangely it touted the 'animal' aspect of the creature right after.After the creature scratched the woman's friend, I immediately knew that the marks on the woman's neck was more than just scratches. Thus, when she ended up having gills, I was not surprised.If you miss it, you're not missing much.",7,2,3,17 January 2018
Zero Dark Thirty," Bigelow is a NeoCon
","What was that? Despite non-existent character development and a lack of story in both this and Hurt Locker, at least Hurt Locker was deserved of the Oscar for Director.This was listless and sloppy. Dwelling was the word of the day. At almost three hours there was no perspective and depth to anything. Although Chastain was an amazing beauty to look at (and she gets four points just for that), I am at a loss for any sort of nomination. She was competent at being moody and pensive. And they had her wearing expensive pant suits and perfectly quaffed hair in the armpit of the world, year after year.And then we launch into her being the 'hero' in the last hour as she was the 'motherfucker' who found her target. And the totally manufactured act of her writing the days on her boss' office wall. I can't imagine that anyone would stay employed anywhere doing that.And I have a few questions:Chastain said she was recruited by the CIA OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL? WHAT? They get the courier's cel phone number. AND THEY CAN'T FIND HIM FOR MONTHS? Is it me or can't they triangulate a cel phone very easily? Maybe I've seen too many spy movies?They finally find the courier in his white SUV. Then they let it go? THEN they find it again by placing men on the various roads?And how long were the soldiers in that compound? Any longer and they should have brought an overnight bag.Now her being a NeoCon. First, the obvious defense of torture.Second, the constant attention on Bin Laden throughout the years and the total absence of when Bush said 'I don't care about him.'Third, the ironic scene where Chastain's boss said (in the middle of Obama's term) that he 'didn't care about Obama.' (Obama was the one who reignited the search.)Fourth, they dwell on an Obama interview where he said 'we don't torture'. And then the CIA woman shaking her head.Fifth, in the conference room we dwell on shots where W's photo is in the background IN THE MIDDLE OF OBAMA'S TERM!It says it was based on personal accounts. Truthful personal accounts?And Bigelow said to see it and decide. I did and call bullshit.",5,8,16,16 February 2013
Joker," Not possible to fully pull this off
","I do acknowledge that there was great effort that Phoenix put into the role, especially the weight loss.But a vast majority of this character study asks the filmmakers to express visually and verbally what is happening mentally. Film is a demanding medium where you have to constantly keep the train moving. And to dwell on long verbal exchanges to pinpoint the character would not be acceptable to an audience. But it's what was needed to approach a more authentic portrayal.A sliver of that was when at the hospital he vaguely admitted the three murders on the subway. He thought it would bother him but didn't. Where it wasn't done was after he realized the girlfriend was a delusion. No real reaction.An unrelated attempt was Negan from The Walking Dead. There were glimpses of reason in the writing but the character started off so annoying, it was a failure from the start.Although a completely different tone, Heath Ledger's Joker take was more interesting and compelling. He was already in the madness but you had a sense of pain in his past.To me, it felt that Phoenix was struggling much of the time. The 'dancing' was the quick way to add an uncomfortable visual to the character. The laughter didn't seem right as was more annoying than uncomfortable. Someone like him went towards a need for power in our lives, like anyone. There was never really anytime of weakness, asking for help and being fearful of losing everything. All that was left for Phoenix was to accentuate the lesser, but visual, elements of the character. Sometimes those were over the top.So the story was a series of incidents that started to tear away at that 'power.' If anything, what I saw was a series of coincidence. We were just going to the next and next and next until the eventual break. I didn't get the feeling of a gradual descent into madness. He was already significantly mentally ill and didn't get worse. He was just shown he didn't have any power to begin with and thus made a decision to go the route he went.A couple quibbles of details was Randall gave Arthur a gun as one character and then ended up suddenly another. Arthur pointing the finger at Randall as owning the gun was forced.The mother ends up as previously being very mentally ill. But I saw no sign of that in the portrayal of her old.Also the detectives said they found out Arthur asked someone if he could buy a gun. That was not shown. Was that Randall trying to sell a lie to the cops?Arthur's 'relationship' with Sophie didn't ring true and I clearly knew there was something wrong. So if they wanted that to be a surprise when it was shown to be a delusion, it didn't work. Also, Arthur didn't seem to demonstrate other visual delusions.Surprised I was disappointed. It did try hard to shoot for the stars.",7,3,5,13 January 2020
It Chapter Two," Had issues.
","Didn't see the first but did an adequate job of standing on its own.Found it very uneven throughout, though.Obtaining the 'relics' was hit and miss in coherence as Chastain's and McAvoy's were obtained in the present day. Hader's was cursory but his fight was in the present day. The other two already had theirs and the fight was in flashbacks that had nothing to do with obtaining anything.Seemed to veer away from the rules they set up in favor of more visuals and the fight at the end had elements that looked pulled out of the filmmakers' asses when they were stuck.They knew that denying the threats were real would destroy the threats, but decided to repeatedly ignore them.Making fun of King's history of poor endings in his books was funny. The reference to John Carpenter's The Thing was good. And I assume the pomeranian behind the door was an ode to The Holy Grail's rabbit scene.The town was very sedate vs. the bloodshed going on. A town that small would be in panic mode and would be flooded with news outlets.For its length, they could have worked a bit more on the cursory character arcs for all six. I know it's time consuming, but it sure was long to begin with. Could have swapped that with other things.What happened to the ghoul driving the Trans Am? If Henry took a knife to the heart and lived, why didn't he survive an axe to the head? Pennywise was an alien with supernatural powers? He fed on fear? But the little girl under the bleachers was not in fear. Pennywise was vulnerable to intense bullying?It was entertaining and, although long, didn't really drag.",6,0,1,15 September 2019
Dark Shadows," Watch out for the land mines in the Garden of Eden
","A good amount of good things about this. A few critically flawed.Tim Burton turns in a clinic when it comes to shooting a film. It looked great and was cut well. Some very good acting, especially from Depp. A good story. Colorful characters.Then why didn't it work better? Some critical mistakes.Mainly Depp's character. He's a good guy supposedly turned into a monster who does terrible things and kills a lot of people. He has no choice? This drive is compelling?BUT, if he is a good man and OUR hero, why doesn't he just walk outside in his underwear and let the sun kill him? To save his soul and innocent victims. He doesn't even kill bad people. He doesn't try to just drink animal blood as a panacea.That is overlooked. For its flaws, this was addressed with the Hulk character in The Avengers. Dr. Banner said he tried to eat a bullet to save the innocent from The Hulk's rage. But the Hulk spit the bullet out. Thus, he had no choice but to live and try to manage his burden. But Depp's character had a clear choice and didn't take it. Thus, I could not sympathize with him, even though the character was likable when that element was gone.And this is based on a soap opera that I never saw. What I saw was a film that was satirical look at a stilted original. But the jokes didn't work. They were stale and mildly amusing at best.And the love story was poorly established. Depp is smitten with Victoria. Then it's dropped 'til SUDDENLY Depp is in love with her. No long looks from across the room?Worth a look. Don't get me wrong. But wait for it 'til it comes out on DVD.",7,2,4,26 May 2012
12 Strong," Meh!
","Was not on my list to see and didn't find it especially attractive. In line with what I expected, though.I'm usually very entertained by gunfights and action. This is very conventional. The explosions were pretty impressive, though.Very much geared to the patriotic crowd, the flag wavers. Don't get me wrong. 9/11 was a terrible day and I don't want anyone to be killed by anything. But 17 years later and it seemed dated in its enthusiasm for THAT war, which was more a failure than anything.A bit disappointed that quality actors like Shannon and Pena would sign up for this. Hemmesworth really does not have range and only looked the part.Initially was Muslim bating from the subject matter to the brief depiction of the Taliban. Of course the Taliban were monsters and a'holes, but wasn't for another 30 minutes 'til it balanced itself out a bit vs. the Gen. Dotsum character. The other sympathetic element were the Taliban forcing innocent farmers to fight for them, as briefly described. Also Hemmesworth's 'first kill' was examined in the scene afterwards, but was also by-the-numbers. Any attempt to say 'war isn't pretty' was brief and cursory vs. the cartoonish and over-the-top depiction of the many battle scenes. American Sniper did a much better job being anti-war, even though everyone was saying it was the opposite.Some very good actors on a good day, but this really wasn't a good day. A lot of action but barely acceptable directing from Nicolai Fuglsig, who per this site has next-to-no credits. I'd be curious on that story, as I've seen big movies given to new directors. But at least those directors did a string of short films.Of course it was 'based on a true story' which I take with a grain of salt. Forgave it with All Is True recently, but that was astoundingly good. But even the cursory reading I did afterwards showed it took liberties.Miss it if you can.",6,0,1,20 May 2019
Arrival," I shouldn't have liked it, but I did.
","So much going against it, mainly there was not much to it. For a very long time, there's no ticking clock. No tension. No threat.I went in trying to pay attention because of the mixed reviews and that many said they were confused. I generally wasn't confused although it tried very hard to be such. The 'loose' chronology was apparently verified by experts, but was sometimes hard to swallow.The opening was effective on trying establish sympathy for Amy Adams character. But it took me out of such when she didn't age, although the daughter's life probably covered 15 years, at least. Then, of course, we find out that the birth of the daughter had not happened.Although I enjoyed Adams performance, it really turned out there was nothing to the character. The supposed sympathy card about the daughter was the cheat and it never happened. Sure, she was a brave scientist, but not much else.Found it jarring that the arrival and lead up to the meeting of the aliens was slow and methodical but then once they met them, we quickly cut to the post-op of that meeting. The tension and anxiety was evident but then the twisting of gravity (because the ship was tall and thin) was just a device and not really interesting.And there was not much to the rest of the film, where most of the tension (albeit manufactured) of the piece exists. The soldiers get paranoid. The Chinese get paranoid. Although probably plausible in the real world, I just had a tough time with it in the context of a film.But the concept was very interesting. Shades of Slaughterhouse 5. I had also seen another very interesting time movie called 'Predestination,' but had a serious paradox. The paradox questions came up with Arrival. Why was she having dreams about a daughter that she never had? Why was she having visions of a meeting with the Chinese general she never had? But I bought it.But it dropped the ball on what 'gift' the aliens supposedly gave Earth. And was the daughter what would save the aliens in the future?",8,1,6,13 January 2017
Parasite," Well made and acted, but...
","Generally interesting if you bookend the acts and scenes.Interesting that it's coming as a series as it seemed more suited for such. As if there was more to see which would make it more compelling. I've had that recently where a poor or neutral film would make a better series.For instance, the whole process of the poor family getting themselves jobs took up too much time in a movie. Although they are introduced quickly and are likeable, I didn't get the full sense if they were just struggling or were grifters. My guess is grifters. But I shouldn't be guessing. I should be told.The second half when the former maid shows up felt very manufactured. Why did they let her in? The underground bunker was original but how we got there was more it trying to write itself out of a corner. But both would have worked in a series.The maid turning the tables on them was fine once you were in the underground space, but arriving there was forced. Then the rich family returning was a bit much. Plausible but a bit much.When the maid is kicked down the steps, I thought she was dead from the head wound. So it was odd when the poor husband said 'Thank God' when he checked if she was breathing after seeing the blood on the back of her head. Conversely, being that she was bleeding but still breathing, he didn't take it seriously enough.The element of the rich father saying the poor father smelled like radishes was a set-up for the ending, but it wasn't enough. When it came, I didn't buy it.The sex scene between the rich couple was awkward and unnecessary.I did see the motivation of the underground man attacking the poor family. But like I said before, I didn't see why the poor father would attack the rich man. And it was obvious where he went afterwards.Not sure why the mother and the son were prosecuted as I didn't see any direct evidence against them. The underground was still unknown to the police. Confused if the rich man died. The father's morse code attempts were very awkward, much less the son seeing them.In the end it was very well made but whatever the message was muddled. Clearly suggested classism but only touched on it at best. I've seen Bong Joon Ho's Snowpiercer, his segment in Tokyo!, The Host, Memories of Murder and Mother. (Surprised there was so many when I looked him up.) Thought about the same of those: well done but not seeing the hype.",8,1,1,10 March 2020
Prometheus," Stick a fork in Ridley
","The main problem is that it had no heart. Want a movie that looks great? This is your movie. (Which means he wins the award for spending money.)It wasn't even that cool. Some good elements like Theron and Fassbinder. Rapice wasn't even that good, which was surprising. But it was a monster movie. Not a psychological piece about man meeting his maker, or God.Everything was anti-climatic and bland. We knew from the ads that it was aliens as the daddies of man. We knew that the alien ship was going to crash at the end. We knew that Aliens were somewhere in the mix. What was the corporate intent? The old man wanted to meet God. But Fassbinder's android had another idea infecting the crew? Why? I thought Thereon was behind capturing the Alien but she turned out to just have daddy issues.And early on. Doctor couple finds the solar system on cave painting. Okay. It's an 'invitation'. But in the end it wasn't. They 'invited' the human race to their weigh station (as it wasn't the home planet)? We needed a reason to go to the planet in the beginning but turned out to be stupid in the end.A few 'pops', so to speak, where overlooked. The creature in the husband's eye. Blah (which I just saw on an even worse 'Falling Skies'). The supposed dead old man appears at the end. Blah. The old man is Thereon's daddy. Blah. The alien stumbles out of the sleep chamber. Blah. The pilot and those two other guys decide to hurdle the ship and themselves into the alien ship. 'Okay, guy?' 'Uh, sure. Why not?' Blah.(I do get why the alien daddy hated humans and Earth. He probably went under around when W was elected the 2nd time.)What about when they all woke up. Nobody had met anybody else? It was very labored to tell us this several times. They couldn't have a cup of coffee beforehand? It felt awkward.And for all of Scott's slamming of the other Alien movies, the 2nd-4th had pretty decent characters that you cared about. This had cardboard cutouts xerox'd from the other films.Like the mohawk geologist who launched the balls that mapped the caves. He had the map and couldn't get out of the cave? And he and his buddy with glasses turned into clowns. And those guys were the better of the lot.It was very convenient that the aliens videotaped themselves doing everything in grainy hologram and Fassbinder cue'd both up at just the right time.And it was mentioned briefly in IMDb. How did Fassbinder talk alien?Also, the alien daddy woke up in a sleep chamber and decapitated Fassbinder. Then the alien launched the ship from a different compartment? And then left the sleep chamber behind? Somebody said to me that it was one in the same. But I don't recall seeing the alien daddy and his chair in the compartment when Rapice picked up Fassbinder and his head after the crash.They missed a SPLAT sound effect when Thereon was crushed by the ship.I don't know. My hope eclipsed my common sense. I would have been fine waiting for DVD.",7,3,4,23 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Profoundly Bad
","How does the guy who did 'Inception' make something so very poor? I think on purpose.This thing was so listless, lazy, rambling, badly acted (from great actors), nonsensical and stupid. Even surprisingly poorly shot vs. his other films.Based on the first two movies, I never really thought that Nolan liked the material. The first was talky and pompous. The 2nd only entertaining. I didn't think he liked action movies. After 'Inception', I had to abandon the action movie theory.1. There are devices that are done over and over in movies for a reason. They work. They can be bad if the director is bad. They can be good if the director is good. This includes story elements and execution in the film-making itself. 2. I think Nolan considered those elements and, for whatever reason, said 'I'm not using those.' Thus, he replaced those with a variety of elements that were substantially inferior to the others. 3. My theory is he wanted to make a movie very bland and labored that still made a lot of money. Maybe to comment on how much the public will patronize bland movies if the broad elements are in place. Why go to the 1st midnight show when the exact same movie is shown at 3pm the next day?Now let me comment on the elements of the movie itself.1. I didn't buy that Bruce Wayne went into seclusion. Batman, yes (because of his hypothesis of making Dent a hero, which was weak and labored to begin with). Wayne? No. His motivation was 'cause his love was killed. But there were no flashbacks to solidify such. And I didn't feel it in Bale's performance. And it was out-of-character for Wayne. 2. The middle 1.5 hours was talky, preachy and a roundabout to the siege. A parade of stale-looking shots of talking heads in small and boring areas.3. Hathaway's vamp image and power over men wasn't workin' for me. No work was put into it.4. The siege of Gotham. Why? Why wait for five months from when you take it over and then destroy it? 5. How does Bane NOT get word that Wayne has escaped? 6. The logistical impossibilities were silly, even if you consider dramatic license and satire. 8. Clocks-a-tickin' on the bomb and Batman takes the time to set-up the burning bat symbol on the bridge? And he's always in the exact right place for dramatic effect.9. Why let the cops in the tunnels live? 10. Why run towards a group of bad guys that are firing guns right at you? 11. They just stand around and let the bad gal ramble on as she dies while the bomb ticks away? Then the exchange with Batman and Catwoman? Then the exchange with Batman and Gordon? PLEASE! Clocks-a-tickin'.12. (Was it me or did the bad gal go from trailing the bomb truck, to being in the passenger seat of the bomb truck, to driving, to passenger, to driver?)13. Okay, Wayne fakes his death, takes the first train out of Gotham and sits in that café at the exact right time so Michael Caine can have closure? Send a postcard. (He sure got over his lost love and his one-night-stand pretty easily.)(I have to admit I totally missed the Robin reveal at the end 'til it happened.)I personally was offended by the premise. It suggested that Bane was the champion of the 99% and thus made the 99% the bad guys. It made the rich the good guys. It made the city a Garden of Eden. And its savior the rich man. Romney would be proud!You're going to see it. Out of curiosity. That's why I went. I just didn't expect it to be so much worse than the other two.",3,5,14,4 August 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Don't make me cry!
","In a good way.I've been a long-time Wes Anderson fan but this was even better than I could have hoped.The camera work was nothing less than masterful and beautiful (peppered with a few 'blah' shots). That alone earns 7 of the 9 points. Everything was so colorful, interesting and detailed.The storytelling was original with quirky and interesting characters. Dialogue was generally good but not quite up to expectations. It didn't have that snap.Even Bruce Willis was good. He does John McClain well but I've been surprised how bad he is in other films. (He said in an interview that he likes acting but isn't very good. I concur.)Actually everything was so overwhelmingly good I would start with 12 out of 10.But then 3 points off for the following:I didn't click into the melodramatic delivery at first. It wasn't quite up to a Hal Hartley mastery of such.Bill Murray and Francis McDormand with kids that young? Uhm......no.Most of the kid actors were not very good. There are good kid actors out there but Mr. Anderson managed to find some of the worst. Don't get me wrong. As written, the characters were engaging. But the two leads were bland and the boy muddled many of his lines.And for those who have seen them, the scenes when the two kids kissed and embraced were uncomfortable. Even in their underwear it was a bit much for me. Do kids fool around with kids? Sure. It's natural. But I wouldn't want my kid to do those scenes. (If I even knew where they were. Probably out drinkin'.)But don't wait for DVD. This is worth payin' your good money for.",9,1,3,8 June 2012
Flight," Not Really There
","At best, I was only mildly interested throughout.Washington was good, at times. The first scene, the drunk scene at his farm and the scene at the AA meeting in jail at the end were the best. Many times actors squeak through a nomination based on a couple scenes. Sometimes even one. But he was not consistent throughout.One of the complaints I've heard is the character was not likable. I didn't see that. Drunks can be extremely selfish. But there were many instances where he was not. A few where he was actually kind.The hearing at the end was very anti-climatic for me. It didn't help that they played that scene at the Oscars before I saw it. But he admitted his guilt very matter-of-factly. Not original. And I didn't need anymore after the following scene at the jail, much less the prison cell and the kid visiting.And there wasn't really a middle act. The crash scene was less than stellar as when he turned the plane upside down (which may be accurate), it just seemed silly in movie terms.I'd miss it. Washington was not a good enough draw.",7,1,2,13 May 2013
Looper," Bone in my throat
","A very good execution of a flawed concept. (The director did this before with 'Brick'. It was very interesting but kind of confusing.)There was a lot about it that I liked. But it raised a lot of questions at the same time.(Did everyone else see the ode-to the Twilight Zone with the kid with similar powers that wished adults into the corn field?)I'm going to jump over the platitudes to the acting and film making. (Wasn't the little kid great, too?) Even though Levitt was really a bad guy, I was interested 'cause he was interesting.The over-riding problem I has was that killing your older self was a very bad idea. And, really, it wasn't clear why they did it. When it failed once wouldn't the mafia rethink the process? We got a good reason why so many were being killed later on with the Rainmaker character, but even then, it was strange for a barbaric bad guy to go through all that trouble. We cut to the future with all hell breaking loose and I'm led to believe that the mafia, at the same time, goes through all that trouble to dispose of bodies.And another specific example. We're told that the mafia sends the bodies back in time to be disposed of because it's difficult to fully dispose of a body. Right? Okay, so the mafia shows up to kidnap Bruce Willis and accidentally shoot his wife. Do they take the body with them? Apparently not as it's not with them as they leave. They burned it up in the fire? That wasn't enough?Another side thing. The klutz bad guys captures Willis and brings him back to Jeff Daniels. Just before that we see the cops raiding the bar. But there is nothing with the cops after we enter the bar and have that long shoot out. But again, those were bones that stuck in my throat but the meal itself was actually very good. (Now you might mark 'Was This Helpful?' What does that mean? Are you reading this before you decide to go to this movie? You'd think that IMDb could come up with more engaging choices.)",8,2,5,13 October 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Beautiful!
","This was far better than I thought it would be and I thought it would be an 8. I had to pee for the last twenty minutes but could not move.First scene. Veterans doing their thing and doing it well. Then when the title appears *blam* out of nowhere, I knew I'd like it.I thought I had it figured out. But nooo. I think it's one thing. Then I think it's another. But it turned out to be the third.This was completely original to me. Characters were quickly and clearly established. Satirical. Funny. Thrilling. The control room stuff was gold. The writing very good. The acting good. The direction was good except for the last 20 minutes. Although the content was beautiful, the shot compositions needed help. Take the time. In any case I detest hand-held: it looks bad in all cases and is just plain lazy.But all in all was a wonderful treat. I could have sat through more. Much more. Hopefully there is more of the same on the DVD.",9,0,8,4 May 2012
Moon," Nicely done
","Just saw this multi-layered drama and was very impressed.Sam Rockwell, who is Oscar-worthy on this one, is a lone worker on the Moon, mining for what turns into energy on Earth. We see his daily life and the toll it takes. Although the entire film is very strong, this period of the story is the weakest. Frankly, it raises too many logistical questions to elevate it to a 10.After having a couple of visions (that prove to be of no relevance), he crashes into one of the mining vessels. He then wakes up in the infirmary of his base and is nursed back to health by the companion robot, voiced by Kevin Spacey.Finally the story kicks in when Sam sneaks out and goes back to the site of his crash and finds---HIMSELF! Taking the person back, this 2nd Sam is nursed back to health.The two then have to figure out their dilemma and what exactly is going on during the body of the film. The relationship between the two Sams was a fresh, low-key direction vs. the predictable.It sparks a lot of questions of one's relevance and the value of life itself. There is a new look of fear and mortality in this movie. It presents a very scary 'what if?'",9,5,9,28 June 2009
Warm Bodies," Some Cute Stuff but...no.
","The charming elements and the fact that I'm a zombie addict held my interest but, in the end, this was silly. Even those weirdos who think The Walking Dead is a training film would say 'Ahhhh....no.'The voice overs were very good. Funny.Yes, I know that it's a zombie movie. Silly to begin with. But the story elements were that much more silly.Well dressed and coiffed post-apocalyptic teens? One little bit of zombie scuz on her cheek and the other's don't smell her? Eating brains absorbs memories? And yes. Love cures anything.All ended up as a suburban teen-girl fantasy.",6,0,1,3 January 2014
