Requiem for a Dream," The necessity of a dream
","This is one of the most brutal and shocking movies I've ever seen since it describes drug's impacts in an exorbitant way. When assuming heroine or any drug the first time, I'm sure that everyone thinks that it would be the first and last time, but this movie opens our eyes about the consequences that drug dependence can have. In particular, each character's conclusion represents a possible consequence of drug dependence. It may look exaggerate, but it is not.Aronofsky is one of the directors I appreciate more. He has the capacity to establish an authentic relationship between characters and spectators. Everyone who watches this film suffers with Harry and Marion, even if we are not drug dependent. Everything is so dramatic, but I want to focus on my favourite character from the movie.Sara's scenes are really breath-taking. Her character is not only about drug dependence. It is about loneliness, an empty life without purpose. What is she living for? We can't expect from a genuine old woman like her to become just an annoying blabbermouth who spends her days talking carelessly with neighbours. She needs to escape from her life, she needs a refuge: the TV is the only weapon she can use to fight her emptiness. The red-dress dream is just a necessity for her to have something to think about in her life. But because of her innocence, she becomes soon a media terrorism victim. I know this is not the point of the movie, but sometimes people feel alone, insecure, underappreciated, and the outside world (here the TV) responds just by offering you the easiest way to escape, and the easiest way is tremendously dangerous. Sara's decline really touched and shocked me, more than other characters', and this is due to Ellen Burstyn's outstanding performance. Also Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly's interpretations are remarkable.On balance, I think that the strength of this movie is the empathy which is amplified by a brilliant direction and a sublime soundtrack. When I hear that music, I still get goose bumps after many years.",9,0,0,28 May 2020
Knives Out," Intriguing and amusing
","The thing I liked the most from this movie is the attention to details. Each
character's relationship with the poor Harlan is meticulously described. This
allows you to evaluate which Trombey member could be the murderer and why.
On the other hand, since all characters are treated in the same way, you
can easily deduce that none of them could be the killer after the first part
of the film. The only exceptions are given by Marta and Ransom.Marta is revealed to be the murderer halfway through. But wait.. In the
first half of the movie we are superficially led to believe that she is; so
I think that the choice of this 'fake reveal' is not so smart because if you tell
me who is the murderer after half movie, OF COURSE that is not the killer.
Despite this choice that I did not appreciate, I enjoyed the final moment
where the truth comes out, it was well written and filmed to me. Also the picture and the production were pretty good.To sum up, I think that this is a funny mystery movie and I don't understand
the reviewers who think that it is boring. It works good because it is
enough intriguing and amusing at the same time.",7,1,2,3 June 2020
Match Point," What's the (match) point?
","The first part of the movie seemed interesting, even if this is not my kind of film, for sure. I enjoyed the adultery thing but it could have been written in a better way (did they really have sex under the rain without getting a cold? Lol). Too many repetitive moments and too many indefinite time jumpings.By the way, I liked how the rich guys have been represented as stupid pampered people with no substance. But not the wife. Damn the wife is too stupid, that's unrealistic! She is assumed to think only about having children with his husband, yet she doesn't understand that there's something wrong with him.But nothing really terrible until the 'thriller' part.
I understand that this movie is something about fortune, but again, this is unrealistic. I neglect the ridiculous police work: that part should have not been filmed to me. Chris' murder plan has been smart, but not so much that he could get away with it. This is not about being lucky, this is about
being sorrounded by stupid blind people.And what's the consequence of the murder? Just an hallucination?So the question is: what's the point?
The main character has been an angel-looking bad guy for the whole time and no one noticed that. He is able to do whatever he wants, it doesn't matter: fortune would always help him. This makes no sense to me.At least I agree on the fact that Scarlett Johansson is attractive to everyone.",5,0,1,27 May 2020
Lost in Translation," A nobler love
","Sometimes we forget who we really are. Sometimes we nullify ourselves just for material purposes. After that, loneliness looks unbeatable. But suddenly someone enters your life and changes it. 'Lost in translation' concerns a game of romantic and furtive glances which generates the spontaneous encounter of two broken souls, skillfully interpreted by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.Bob and Charlotte's dissatisfaction is evident in their expressions and behaviors. Fortunately, their paths have intersected and they get the chance to have a sincere dialogue with someone who truly understands them. The result is a respect-based relationship characterized by an innate chemistry. It's not about sex, courting or dates. It's a nobler love.Everyone who is sensitive should watch this movie. Moreover, it provides us a chance to think about our own life.",8,2,2,31 May 2020
