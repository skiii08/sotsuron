Conquest 1453," A touchstone for the Turkish film industry...
","First of all, the movie is definitely worth watching. Although it is not perfect in terms of the script and the digital effects, we must admit that the effort is worthy of commendation. It is a significant step for the Turkish film industry with its $17M budget and more importantly, its bravery to make the movie of the conquest of Istanbul, a great historical event that is divine for not only the Turks but also the entire Muslim world. Of course we need to criticize, but the critics should be as supportive as possible in order not to discourage people. By the way, even though it is a $17M budget movie, it is not fair to compare this movie with Hollywood productions since the budgets of similar Hollywood productions are more than $100M. For all these reasons, it is a great production, definitely worth to watch, and everyone should be supportive about it to make the Turkish film industry better.",9,81,170,19 February 2012
