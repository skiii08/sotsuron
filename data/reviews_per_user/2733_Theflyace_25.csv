The King's Speech," Some Good Bits, Overall Stutters Poorly
","Well, i've mentioned this movie very unflatteringly in my reviews for 'Inception' and 'The Social Network,' so it's high time I weigh in on why I have done so. 'The King's Speech' tries to tell a noble story in a surprisingly good CONTEXT, but the EXECUTION is stiff, bland, and almost forgettable.This biopic is about King George VI, but starts out as Prince Albert, Duke of York. As a man of his royal and public stature, he has a very unique problem, he stutters very badly. After, OF COURSE, consulting the most qualified diction teachers in England, his wife (played by Helena Bonham Carter) finds, OF COURSE, a quirky little man, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) who takes the job to help Bertie cure his problem in, YOU GUESSED IT, the most unconventional and 'entertaining' of ways. Unexpectedly, Bertie's father dies and his brother takes the throne. But true to history his brother (who OF COURSE makes fun of Bertie's situation) falls in love with an American and abdicates, meaning Bertie is now the new king. With war beginning against Germany, Bertie questions himself and his abilities based on the fact that he can't talk properly. He makes the rousing speech to his people, and its a happy ending. YAWN.The writer of this movie, David Seidler, stutters himself, so I can understand why he would write this movie, and it has very noble intentions. He even makes some surprisingly good story choices. When Bertie learns Logue isn't a qualified teacher (which OBVIOUSLY is the 'liar revealed' clichés that bugs so many movies) he immediately shrugs it off because Logue is his friend and stands by him. Kudos. But my overuse of the words 'OF COURSE' is for the rest of the story (except the final speech scene which I mention below) It offers us practically nothing new, and this kind of story has been done so many times that it feels so much like a retread instead of Best Original Screenplay. I'm still miffed by that selection over Christopher Nolan's brilliantly fresh screenplay for 'Inception.' Tom Hooper, who did very well for the mini-series 'John Adams,' makes the story even feel more like retread by using unusual angles and lighting and sound (The sound is so poor in this movie your speakers have to be up at full volume to even hear the basic dialog and music. I HATE THAT) Danny Cohen, the cinematographer, uses obnoxious close-ups, dutch-angles, and some shaky cam to poor effect(AAAAAAHHHHHHHH) He even repeats it to a worse degree in 'Les Miserables' (which i will review very soon) But the strength of Hooper as a director is his command of the actors, for the most part.One of the beacons of light for me in this movie is Colin Firth as Bertie. He is brilliant, given the material he has to work with. He does show that he is insecure after the emotional hell he has gone through in his life because of his stammer. It is at lest interesting to watch him blossom from the laughed at Prince to a newly respected King.The other actors I refuse to talk about because I found them that brand of British acting that I call 'Blandly British' meaning not much to offer and looking bored, especially from Helena Bonham Carter and even Geoffrey Rush, who I like as an actor.Then there is the speech to the nation. HOLY GOD IS THIS SCENE INCREDIBLE!!!!!! It's a rousing speech! It starts slowly and builds beautifully in terms of pacing, Firth delivers it ungodly well, an the music chosen (the allegretto of Beethoven's 7th Symphony) compliments the scene in the best way possible. If the rest of the movie was on the same level as this beautiful scene was, I would have liked it a whole lot more.When this movie took home 4 Oscars, I was happy for only one, Colin Firth for Best Actor. he deserved it. The others, I was stunned, and couldn't speak at all. I felt that 'The Social Network' should have taken the Picture and Director prize, and 'Inception' for original Screenplay. But I can moan all I want, I can't change anything.I totally get the movie's noble intentions, and it succeeds in some areas. But as a whole, its is boring, stiff, flat, slow, hard to hear (literally) and mostly forgettable. But it a least has a good performance in there and a speech that will rouse anyone who listens to it.",6,0,2,20 September 2013
Miracle," Kurt Russell's Career-Defining Performance in this inspirational Disney Film
","The greatest moment in recent Olympics history was the so-called 'Miracle on Ice,' when the amateur Hockey team from the U.S. defeated the long time Soviet champions at Lake Placid. The journey was a long and arduous one, with the players being driven to top condition both mentally and physically by coach Herb Brooks. In 2004, Walt Disney Pictures produced a recreation of the events leading up to and including the legendary event, with disgustingly underrated actor Kurt Russell as Coach Brooks. The result is not only a really inspirational but down-to-earth adaptation, but Russell in his career-defining role.The year is 1980. America is at a low point in terms of spirit and morale. Iran has taken hostages, Gas is running low, and the Soviets seem to be dominating the Middle-East with no one to stop them. To the U.S. Olympic committee, they have no chance to beat the longstanding champions of the USSR, so they decide to give college students the chance to play under Coach Herb Brooks. Brooks is a hard man determined to knock the Soviets off their pedestal, but not for reasons you would think. There is some bad luck to begin with but the team eventually makes it to Lake Placid and begin their legendary game against the Soviets.What makes Miracle so impressive is the fact that it focuses more on Herb Brooks than it does the team members. Brooks has unfinished business with the Soviets, as he was cut from the 1960 team the week before the games, the only team to beat the Soviets up to that point. He is a rather blunt and mean man who pushes the team to their limits. he makes absolutely no bond with anybody, as he sees this as the way to intimidate his team into performing at their highest levels. But with all this, there is a likability to Brooks that make him all the more three-dimensional, not just a cartoon over-the-top coach.The key to what I just said and the pure ingredient to what makes the film work is Kurt Russell. Here, he paints the portrait of a hurt and driven man who not only wishes to fulfill some need for vindication, but to give people the joy that was taken from him at the eleventh hour. He also looks the part, with the hair, jowl, and even those silly outfits that were considered to be cool back in the day. This is a great performance, one that I really believe was robbed of an Oscar. Not just a nomination, but a full Oscar win. Russell is Herb Brooks, hands down.The recreation of the events are also really good. The Soviets aren't portrayed as the bad guys, but the team that they just have to beat for Brooks. They aren't stereotypical Russian bad guys, but people we don't know apart from what we saw on the television screen in 1980. Its strange how one can often forget that this movie was produced by Disney. One would think the movie is schmaltzy and sugar-coated, but this is one of those exceptions. I think the only thing Disney couldn't allow was strong language that may be prevalent in hockey, but we can forgive them for that one.There has been an argument that there are too many sports movie clichés to be found in this movie. Well, I don't see any of them, except for one. Patricia Clarkson plays the stereotypical housewife who does nothing but complain. I don't watch the scenes with her or I try to mute whatever she says when she talks with Kurt Russell. Other than that, there is nothing to gripe about. I think the reason that critics see them as clichés is because the elements that seem familiar, are actually based on real events and dialog. I never saw this as anything more than history being put onto film with a Hollywood crew and actors. It seems to be and actually is very faithful.This is a good film. There are some slow spots, and maybe some flaws, but none that were easy to notice or try to notice. Kurt Russell is exceptional, and makes this a must see sports film.",8,1,1,4 February 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Month #4: Not as Evil as People Think it Is
","I was five years old when Phantom Menace came out on video, and of course, I was instantly hooked. When I got older though, I started reading up on the complaints fans have. And when I mean complaints, I really mean death threats made against these specific individuals: George Lucas, Jake Lloyd, and Jar-Jar Binks. Seriously I have seen these. Now that I'm older and understand more about what makes a movie work and not work, I can honestly say Phantom Menace isn't as great as I remember, but by gum is it an entertaining movie.The story starts out with some sort of trade dispute between a group called the Trade Federation and the planet of Naboo, run by Queen Padme Amidala (played by Natalie Portman) When Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi (the brilliantly cast Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor)are dispatched to negotiate a truce, the Federations intentions are made clear when they try to kill the two and stage a government takeover on Naboo. After rescuing the Queen, it is decided to hide the damaged ship on Tatooine until they can repair it. There they meet the boy Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and Qui-Gon thinks he may be the chosen one to bring balance to the force. Then ensues action, planning, and a bunch of dazzling effects.The story is actually interesting because it takes its time to develop. However this does lead to the argument that it really has nothing going for it. I find a mid-ground, its interesting but some things are unnecessary, For example, the sub-plot on Coruscant really yields one thing but we spend like half an hour there. Sometimes the dialog doesn't work, like some of Obi-Wan's humor, but for the most part its fine. Lucas had so much pressure to live up to the Original Trilogy. With the standards the fans put on him, he could never live up to those impossible expectations. The acting and characterization has been a source of jokes and criticism for most viewers. It's really not that bad as you may think. You have some very good actors (like Neeson, McGregor, and Portman)and some who get the job done (Lloyd, McDiarmid, and Quashie) I never saw anyone I really hated in here and I still don't. For those with a heart, leave Jake Lloyd alone. he didn't do a bad job. I truly don't understand how people think Lucas made him an all knowing genius as a kid for worse. Some kids are more technologically gifted than others and some have deep thoughts. Sure his performance doesn't work at moments, but its still OK. Now we come to the aspect of the film people hate the most... Jar Jar Binks. People wish this character never graced the universe and would rather die than listen to him any more. I have a confession to make. I sort of like Jar Jar. Let me explain myself... I know he's an awful character. I know he was probably thrown in for 'comic relief only.' but seriously he was one of the first CGI characters in a movie, that's a huge accomplishment. And if people acknowledge him as a character that they somehow connected to on a bad emotional level, that means the effect worked. For me, I thought he was funny growing up, and I still think he kind of is.The effects are truly spectacular in this movie, some of the cleanest and best I have ever seen in my life. While Jar Jar is quite clearly visible these days as a CGI character, the others are actually very convincing. The Podrace on Tattoine is one of the best things I have ever seen put to cinema, it looks real and exciting at the same time. The music by John Williams is also a bit of a departure, which is an exceptional thing. He incorporates Sanskrit sounds and building up music to outstanding effect, which makes it sound more awesome than it already is. So yeah, I like this movie. I recognize its flaws sure, but this movie is meant to be fun and entertaining. It's not the best, but it sure ain't the worst.",6,2,4,23 January 2014
Skyfall," Bond Month #23: The Best of them: My Final Review of the Month
","Well my title says it all about Skyfall. This has to be the best of the Bond films,not just because it's kick ass and fun, but there's also a very good story and characters to go with it. After the debacle known as Quantum of Solace, this is the best return to form since Casino Royale in 2006.The story this time around is very M-centric. Bond must track down a former agent, Raoul Silva, who is after M for betraying him years before. M is also being phased out as her methods are seen as both passé and dangerous to the agents in her organization, and she both has to fight Silva and the knowledge that the world is changing and that she can no longer keep up with it. Bond also has his own journey as he was presumably killed at the beginning of the film, he becomes out of shape and cynical, but still will protect his boss, who is the closest thing to his mother. We also learn about Bond's childhood at his father's mansion Skyfall, which is really interesting.We get some of the best acting in this series and fresh faces to old favorites. Daniel Craig does his finest work as an actor in this one, making Bond three-dimensional once again. We get the new Q in the form of Ben Whishaw, whom I think easily fills in for the respected shoes of Desmond Llewelyn. Ralph Fiennes is a government agent Mallory, who becomes M later on. We get Naomie Harris as Eve (Moneypenny) who is unfortunately the one person who doesn't work for me, but oh well.Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva. SPOT ON PERFECT CASTING. Silva is my favorite villain of the series, and has set the bar for future ones to come. He is calm and collected, never going over the top in what he does or says. He is also a bit effeminate, which makes him very unique, unlike the gay duo Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd from Diamonds are Foerever. He doesn't overplay it, which is why I mention it. He is also intimidating as hell, being given the best villain intro in movie history. It's a long shot that lasts for a long time until he finishes the story he tells us and Bond. So brilliant! The director of this movie, Sam Mendes, actually brings a more refined look and feel to this series than even Martin Campbell (but both are on the same level in my opinion) He utilizes quiet dramatic moments with some very well filmed and fast paced action. But he also has the great Roger Deakins to shoot the film, and of course, the photography is beautiful. The one scene that I must single out as beautiful is when Bond fights a henchman in front of a blue light display and all you see is silhouette. It looks exactly like Maurice Binder shot it. Deakins should have won the Oscar for Cinematography on this one.The action is amazing. And surprisingly, I didn't see much shaky cam, or it was so minimal that I didn't know there was any to be had. It has the best.And I will mention one more aspect of this brilliant film. Adele's theme song. I haven't talked much about the theme songs in Bond because with the exception of maybe 6 of them, I don't care for them much. But when Adele wrote and sang this song, it added a level to greatness not a lot of people thought Bond would have. She deservedly won the Oscar for the song, nice work! This film is awesome. I have watched it many times, and I'm sure there will be many more in the future.That concludes Bond month. I'm theflyace, and thanks for reading.P.S. Prepare for my best-to-worst Bond films, villains, and actors lists in my profile.",9,1,5,31 October 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A Great Rousing Adventure from the Dream Team of Spielberg and Lucas
","Everybody at least knows of or has seen Raiders of the Lost Ark. It is one of those great movies that was supposed to be a throwback to an old adventure for kids, but has become a vital part of our culture. I think the reason why it is better than the old Republic Pictures serials that it is inspired by is that it takes a 'modern' approach, but is still timeless in how it was executed. And with the geniuses of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas behind the camera, this film reached an incredible level of excellence.The story is about an archaeologist named Indiana Jones, who has a flair for finding rather rare treasures with supernatural ties. On this particular adventure, he sets out to find the lost Ark of the Covenant. Along the way he joins with an old flame, Marion Ravenwood, who is angry with Indy for doing something to her in the past, but the two rekindle their old flame as the film goes. Indy also has to deal with the Nazis, who are trying to bring the Ark to Hitler for his own truly evil purposes. This thread seems as basic as the serials that they were based on, but the way the characters are set up and they way they play off of one another is brilliant. The writer for this movie is Lawrence Kasdan, who incorporated many of Steven and George's ideas, and forged them together into a very witty, exciting, and intriguing script. Each character is memorable and is never wasted, unless they are the secondary characters. Just like the old Republic films, there is breathless action and fast paced pacing, but here there is time for the characters to breathe and develop.Fresh off of Han Solo in Star Wars is Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Instead of being a brash smuggler like Solo was, here is a gruff rugged man who is sensitive and humane, but has just a glimmer of the character of Dobbs from The Treasure of Sierra Madre. Ford is just the natural fit for the character and makes him a fully realized action hero who is not brainless. And like any hero, he has a crippling flaw, a fear of snakes, which presents a great irony when he finally locates the Ark. And on the same level is Karen Allen as Marion. She is really tough and sassy, the perfect tomboy, but somehow presents an elegance that few women characters possess in this kind of genre. She can definitely hold her own in a fight, and gives Indy a perfect lady to fall for, and vice versa in Indy's case.The villains are pretty good in this film. They don't really act like Nazis very much as guys trying to make names for themselves and do their jobs for their fuhrer. Paul Freeman as Belloq is rather interesting. He is Indy's rival and somewhat equal, who will often times steal Indy's stuff and pass it off as his own discovery. He's the kind of guy who doesn't really like to get his clothes dirty. We have a man named Dietrich who is the senior Nazi officer, who serves only for Hitler and no one else. But then there is Toht, played by forgotten character actor Ronald Lacey. He is really creepy and menacing, but with a great side of humor, like Peter Lorre (which was Spielberg's intention) He is in all black wherever he goes and always wears a coat, which leads to one of the best gags in cinema.But the movie is very well known for the exciting action sequences. Lucas has a great notion of what should happen, but Spielberg is the true genius of these scenes. Spielberg is the kind of director who knows what he wants to see, which coincides with exactly what the audience wants as they view it. So when something exciting happens like when Indy jumps from a horse onto a moving truck, its done in such a way that it seems much more jaw dropping and stunning even though its perfectly logical in the grammar of an adventure movie.When Lucas and Spielberg decided to do this film, they would do it the old-fashioned way, quick, dirty, and relatively inexpensive. That's why the movie comes off as very fast-paced and imaginative. But one thing that reels the viewer's mind is that Lucas, the man who transformed special effects in Star Wars, would use 'cheap' and old special effects. But again, they're done so convincingly that one hardly notices their imperfections, because they seem so logical and necessary. When the Ark is finally opened, it is mysterious and ultimately dooming for those who look upon the power of God, a fantastic display.The best known aspect of the film is John William's score, which is perfect. It is a rousing score which gets the blood going, and accents key moments of both progression and shock in the scenes its featured in. The 'Raider's March' is one of the most famous themes in music, mainly because it builds and builds to an exciting payoff, just like the movie's story itself.This movie, nominated for Best Picture in 1981, was a huge surprise for the producers. It was surprising for an 'audience picture' to get such recognition, when only few had done so (like Star Wars and Jaws) Even though it didn't win, it's reputation is still extremely strong among movie buffs like me, and even people who just want an escape for two hours out of their lives. There was a lot of passion and collaboration in front of and behind the camera to gives us something special. The dream team succeeded.",10,0,1,4 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Star Wars Month #3: Something, Something, Something Dark Side
","Following two really great and imaginative films, Return of the Jedi seems a bit like a letdown. Its not that its bad, I just feel slightly annoyed when I watch it. The story is understandably under pressure to live up to Episodes VI and V, but it doesn't really stand as tall. There are some good things though, so let's take a look.The conclusion of the trilogy entails the threat of a new (yet somehow half finished 'OPERATIONAL') Death Star. This time the Emperor himself (played fiendishly awesome by Ian McDiarmid) has come to lure Luke Skywalker into joining the Dark Side, but Luke's only concern is to free his father Anakin Skywalker from the darkness of Darth Vader. Meanwhile, after freeing Han from Jabba the Hutt, which takes an inordinately long time I may add, the our heroes go to the teddy bear infested toy store... I mean Ewok run moon of Endor to destroy the Death Star's shied so Lando Calrissian can destroy the station's jumper-upper thingy.There are, unfortunately, very weak elements to this story even though it should really have been more epic and emotional. The stuff on Tatooine with Jabba the Hutt goes on for far longer than it should, but Jabba is a rather interesting fellow, so at least that carries us through it. The dialog and characterizations are really bad in this one, and I mean really annoyingly bad. Luke barely smiles once in this movie, and for the most part, he looks and sounds depressed. His platitudes aren't that great either when he talks to his father. Leia and Han are equally as boring. There is just no more spark between any of them anymore, and they seem like they're either playing role models to a fault, or they are caricatures of themselves. The element that really does bug me is the reveal of the fact that Luke and Leia are twins. Add the fact that they had kissed each other romantically and formed a sort of love triangle in the previous two films...EEWWWW!!!!! It wasn't necessary at all, so why it was done is completely beyond me. When I talk about the dialog, it comes off as stilted and muted. Words aren't emphasized, and when they are, people use them as catchphrase, i.e. 'It's A Trap!' Family Guy best summed up the Emperor's dialog by repeating the words 'Dark Side, Good, Complete, my Young Apprentice or Operational.' The rest is really default word placement, i.e. something, something, something, Dark Side. No one talks normally in this movie, and it truly annoys me. Now onto the good things. The effects are truly spectacular, some of the best in the series, namely found in the Death Star dogfight. Here it looks like effort was really put into the movie to make it stand out. Bravo. The emotional journey of Darth Vader is actually handled very well, and the moment when he removes the mask that keeps him alive to really look upon his son is very sad but we are reminded that he has redeemed himself in the process, bringing balance to the force. So I do have mixed feelings about Return of the Jedi. It's not bad, but its not that great either. Now we move onto the controversial Prequel Trilogy. I will try to handle these films as fairly and as best as I can.",6,1,3,21 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Wars Month #5: Its Actually Better Than People Think, Despite the Dialog
","After fans were driven bonkers by The Phantom Menace, they were hoping upon hope that Attack of the Clones would be better. Again, Lucas seemed to misstep with a lot of them. I laugh at this movie often, but you know, it's a much better movie than people remember. It has a tinge of darkness to it much like Empire Strikes Back does. There are many things in this film that I feel have to be addressed. So here we go.Ten years or so after the events of Phantom Menace, Queen Padme is now Senator Padme, who immediately starts the movie off with her nearly being assassinated. Talk about starting off with a bang! She suspects former Jedi master Count Dooku (played by the excellent Christopher Lee) of the deed, but the council is skeptical. Now grown up Anakin Skywalker (played by Hayden Christensen) is assigned to protect Padme while his master Obi Wan is dispatched to solve the mystery of the assassin bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Fett has be used as the host for a secret Republic Clone Army (the ancestors of the Stormtroopers) While hiding Padme on Naboo, both begin to feel an attraction for one another, even though its forbidden for Anakin to love another as a Jedi. The story actually has a lot going on here. Lucas introduces threads that will be long lasting throughout the present Saga of films. We see where the Stormtroopers come from, we learn what the Clone Wars are, we see Luke and Leia's mother, there is just a lot here. But instead of focusing on that, Lucas puts his energy into two main stories. Story A, it seems, is the love story between Anakin and Padme. Story B is Obi Wan figuring out what goes on when Jedi don't look at invisible planets. Both stories are actually very well developed and take time for them to unfold. The love story works well considering the dialog. We all knew this was coming. The dialog during the love scenes isn't as good as the way it develops. Some lines are truly hokey or wooden in delivery. I feel this mostly comes from Hayden Christensen. In this movie he doesn't seem to be acting as he is sleepwalking through the movie, never really changing his tone unless he is screaming. Portman does her best to at least to seem interested, but if her co-star is sleepwalking, then she can't do much. Some of the lines are actually good, so we can't say every word is awful. The characterizations in this film are where I have a couple of issues. Obi Wan seems mean and condescending to Anakin in this film, but compared to the first film, his humor is far more funny and his timing is superb. Padme is a very sweet person and dedicated to her job and morals, and she does actually see some good things in Anakin that she loves, but she doesn't become sappy. Yoda and Mace Windu (played by veterans Frank Oz and Samuel L. Jackson in all their grandeur) are spectacular, nothing more to talk about. Count Dooku is a great villain, but it seems like the role was meant for Darth maul had he survived in the first film, but it's Christopher Lee playing him, so hes really good. But the one that I don't like is Anakin. In this film, he is played like a whiny teenager who wants to be master even though he is clearly not ready. One could make the argument that at this age, teenagers are like this, and perhaps that is what George Lucas was going for. But to me, it makes him slightly unlikeable. For some reason or another, the action scene is this movie seem like a 'been there, done that feeling.' Except for one scene, they all feel a little done and way too necessary. The other films scenes were as well, but there was some kind of spark that made seem more spectacular and special then they really are. The exception(s) is the lightsaber battles. Wow! These are really good in pacing and the beauty of their choreography, but what makes it special is that we see YODA FIGHT! That alone should make this movie really memorable!The element of this movie that I think will forever stand the test of time in cinema is the score written by John Williams. Here we have one of the most beautiful themes ever in the history of recorded sound, the love theme known as 'Across the Stars.' It's such a truly beautiful work of art that completely blends with George Lucas' vision of this world he has created. It's also Williams' best love theme since Superman, which itself is a truly beautiful composition. The action is music is also great, punctuating each movement and tick and making the action seem much more important then how they play out in the logic of the story.Final Verdict: Its better than I remember, but it is still kind of hokey and funny. It has a well developed story, four interesting characters, and some fantastic music. But the rest is tired, slow, and really bad dialog. So it's better than Phantom Menace, but nowhere close to the next one.",7,5,8,27 January 2014
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Transcends all Generations
","Roger Ebert once said that 'to see Falconetti in Dreyer's 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' is to look into eyes that will never leave you.' I cannot find a better statement for this miracle of a silent masterpiece. What has been mastered here is a view, taken from historical record, and put under a microscope figuratively and literally on screen to dive into the spiritual essence of destiny. This film is in a class by itself, and had a profound impact on this viewer.The film begins during the 100 Years War in France. In its battle against its enemy England, a commoner rose through the ranks to lead France to many great victories. This great warrior was peasant girl Joan of Arc, not even 18 years old but commanded a presence among her peers and a reputation impressed upon her enemies. Joan has been promised French deliverance from the mouth of God himself. Captured and put on what is essentially a mock trial for the whole film (she would have most likely been executed anyway) she must stand firm against the cacophony of priests who at first spit at her and call her a demon who cries blasphemy. Soon however, when she is given the chance to free herself at the expense of her devout belief in God and refuses, the film becomes a tragedy of the rest form, a good person making the ultimate sacrifice to something bigger than anyone in this film can possibly imagine. The mastery of this film's narrative is in its reliance on the extreme close-up, which i can only estimate takes up 95% of the film. Director Dryer and cinematographer Rudolf Mate take a radical approach to the film, which has stood the test of time as one of the most daring films ever made. Joan's face as well as the other characters fill the frame, and what was not normal for the silent films, the actors do not wear any make-up at all. What this gives is confinement in the audience, as wee are as locked in this small blank room as Joan is, thus helping us feel the emotions of the scenes and care for the main character in a unique way. We cannot look away from the faces, especially that of Joan's astonishingly beautiful eyes.What stands out in this film is the central performance of Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc. When she enters the picture, she does not look like a common heroine. She has short hair, no make-up, and no soft lighting to make her 'gorgeous.' In this way, Falconetti must communicate a visceral reaction and emotions through her facial expressions, and since she is always in close-up, this cannot escape and she cannot cheat. With this said, this is a truly flawless performance, in fact one of the greatest films I have ever seen in Cinema history. When she does stumble and ultimately does the 'morally right' thing, I broke down in tears, quite rarely have I ever had so much respect and heartbreak over a person I never knew. This is a bravura performance that I cannot praise enough.The Passion of Joan of Arc is a miracle, and when given again the fact that it was made in the 1920s, this is even more astonishing. Please see this film and judge for yourself.Note: I am sorry I haven't written in a long time. College and work is murder and time must be put elsewhere quite a lot. But I intend to write more and this film helped me rekindle the flame that git me to doing this in the first place - Theflyace'",10,3,5,5 May 2017
Man of Steel," I don't know if its good or bad
","When I was growing up watching Superheroes, there was a very strange thing that happened. I enjoyed but overall never really liked the Batman made in 1989 (I'll review this soon) but Richard Donner's Superman is in my top ten favorite films ever. When Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight came out, I declared it one of the best films, possibly my favorite of all time. it was dark it was brooding, but also told a very moral and character driven story. It made me love Batman again, as the animated series had for years. So, when i heard that Nolan and writer David S. Goyer would be involved in a Superman reboot I was hyped. Zack Snyder was picked to direct, and then my hype died down a little bit. But I was still excited, i saw the trailer and thought to myself, 'Hey, Snyder might do a great movie this time.' Folks, I am disappointed to say the least.This movie is Superman's origin story from Krypton to the final battle scene. Superman/Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) grows up struggling with his powers and is regarded as a freak whenever they come out. One aspect of the story that is actually very fresh and very new is as a child his powers bombard him and he can't deal with it. The scene at the school where he locks himself in and his mother (Diane Lane) tells him to focus only on her to calm him down was amazing. If only the rest of the movie was as good as this! After traveling around the U.S. trying to figure out his place, he stumbles across the Fortress of Solitude and the A.I. of his true father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) Jor-El believes his son is there to lead the people of earth out of darkness and conveniently made a suit for him (with exact specifications of course) But Oh No! General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrives from the Phantom Zone and tries to take over Earth to re-establish Krypton.Oh Lois Lane shows up in the story, but ultimately is useless, as is everyone else, even Zod. The rest of the cast which I thought would be awesome, were so bland and uninteresting, that I didn't are what the hell they would do. Krypton Looks like something out of a cross between Avatar and a rock, ugly.This was actually one of the most unpleasant experiences ever watching a movie in general. It looks like Snyder directed the camera during a 7.0 earthquake (I hate shaky cam) and most of the actors have no soul or color within the story. The visual effects look, for the most part, pretty bland and basic, and shockingly, way too computerish. And one thing physically and emotionally disturbed me in the theater, Superman and Zod literally destroy Metropolis. It looks like 9/11 times 40.People out there who read this. I am the biggest fan of Christopher Nolan. I love Christopher Nolan, but here, what they did just doesn't apply to Superman. It worked well for Batman because he is a man grounded in reality. But Superman is an alien and he can fly, there's really no reason to ground him in reality too. I still love Nolan. I just think if it was directed by him, it would have been amazing. Alas, they gave it to the guy who did Sucker-Punch, worst idea ever.Gee, there must be nothing I like about this movie. Not true. Henry Cavill packs a solid performance and puts his own spin on the role so effortlessly solidified by Christopher Reeve for so many years, but Cavill comes really close. Some story ideas a really good, especially the scene when he is a kid in school, that was truly amazing. The scene where Superman flies for the first time is incredible too and that is the only time I thought the shaky cam was a great idea. Hans Zimmer's score is awesome. Its not as perfect or grand as John Williams' though, but he should be nominated for an Oscar for making something completely different from Williams, a very hard feat to accomplish.So overall, my review is as chaotic as i thought the film was. I may change it up later to make stronger points. There were some good things, and some bad things. Like my title, i don't know if its good or bad. Its kinda OK.",6,1,4,23 August 2013
Aliens," A Gut-Wrenching, Adrenaline-Driving Thrill Ride!!!!!!
","When Ridley Scott's 'Alien' came out in 1979, people were thrilled and scared out of their minds by it. One of those people was Writer/Director James Cameron. He was so enamored with the world of 'Alien' he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, 'The Terminator,' came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time.The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. The planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a 'consultant' to a battalion of Marines along with a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group, forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters.One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. Its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in.Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed 'Newt.' Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch. Each marine has a memorable personality, and eventually warm up to Ripley and begin to understand the gravity of their situation in this hell-hole. Even Bishop the Android (Lance Henriksen) is given a great personality, and on that Ripley has to learn to trust after her experiences with the evil Ash in the first film.What makes this film far different from 'Alien' is instead of it being a straight up horror/suspense film, the action in this movie is turned up infinitely more, and for good use. Cameron is the master of action and he uses his skills here to a great degree. The action itself plays against a larger environment, expertly designed by Peter Lamont, with he help of artists Ron Cobb and Syd Mead, two of the greatest graphic designers ever. Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. 'Bishop's Countdown' is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason.The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive.This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.",9,1,1,20 September 2013
Pearl Harbor," This Movie Sucks
","As the title of my review suggests, Pearl Harbor, directed by Michael Bay, sucks. It is a ripoff of Titanic as well as Saving Private Ryan, without the majesty or believability of the characters. The writing is very poor, the direction is below sub-par, and the acting is beyond clichéd and hammy. The only redeeming grace is some of the action, but I'll get to that later in the review.The story, or lack thereof, is the love between a pilot (Ben Affleck) in the army, and a navy nurse (Kate Beckinsale.) He goes off to England to fly with the RAF (historically makes no sense as no American officer could ever do that before Pearl Harbor) and is assumed dead. His best friend from childhood (Josh Hartnett), also a pilot, looks after the nurse and they begin to fall in love. But *SHOCK* *AWE* GASP* he's alive and the dreaded love triangle forms. All this entails really really really bad dialogue, love scenes that are extremely awkward, and absolutely no character development. All three actors are at their worst pretty much (only Affleck has saved himself through the power of directing later in his career.) Right now you're thinking, what does all this have to do with Pearl Harbor? Well, the Japanese are planning the attack while Hartnett and Beckinsale kiss and say stupid lines, and are on their way when Affleck shows up again. Then after an HOUR AND A HALF, we get the attack. This is the only pretty good part of the movie, and the special effects are really good. But even the bad writing can get in there. One of the worst moments of the movie is when the Oklahoma capsizes (great sequence by the way) is marred by a NAVY SAILOR says 'I Can't Swim!' WHAT THE ****???? This movie makes the U.S. Military look like complete morons and total idiots when it comes to fighting a war. It's humiliating to those who really died on December 7. Then Affleck and Hartnett get in the air and shoot down some Japanese zero fighters.Those 40 minutes of action are over and we're right back to the love triangle, but thank God ever so briefly. The Doolittle Raid occurs, also a good part of the movie. The ending I don't want to talk about because I'm getting sick of talking about this movie. Typical ending though. Danny dies Affleck gets Beckinsale back. Happy Ending!! Hooray!! HELP! There's a 'happy ending' in a movie about Pearl Harbor. that's just wrongThree hours of total abomination. While I do praise some of the action, the rest of the movie is insufferable. Michael Bay is at his lowest here, and 'Bravehart' writer Randall Wallace has effectively destroyed his career in Hollywood with one of the worst scripts I have ever heard. Avoid this movie at all costs. It's inaccurate, boring, terrible, and should be destroyed.",3,2,3,14 March 2013
Quantum of Solace," Bond Month #22: An Unbearable Viewing Experience, even with so much potential
","After the fantastic experience of watching Casino Royale, I expected something on the same level. I expect way too much from Bond I suppose. Quantum of Solace is a strange experience that would jar the senses of any audience member, even non-Bond fans.Well let's look at the story that I thought had great potential. It picks up directly where Casino Royale left off, with Bond investigating an agent of an organization known as Quantum, which I think is the modern equivalent to SPECTER. This is some guy named Dominic Greene who tries to monopolize a desert country's water before trying to stage a coup-de-tat in said countries with hoarded water. But that's not the main story, its about M whining about Bond being plagued by revenge for the death of Vesper (SPOILER!!) Here's the first problem with the movie for me, the plot suffers from a complete lack of focus (and I'm not talking about the editing or camera-work either, I'll get to that later) Like I said, the story had great potential, but it is underdeveloped and the characterizations often times do not make any sense. Heck sometimes the logic of everything that plays out makes no sense at all. The aspect involving the water isn't all that interesting, and surprisingly, the revenge aspect isn't great either. Now, some people say that about Licence to Kill as well, but there you had a solid story and decent characterizations, but when they are simplified or not clear, it doesn't work as well.The acting is actually the biggest saving grace of this movie, well for the most part. Craig still packs in a solid performance as Bond, giving a far more darker turn than in Casino Royale, but he still manages to incorporate the dry humor that worked very well in the last movie. Olga Kurylenko is amazing as Camille, and even the first Bond girl that Bond doesn't go to bed with all the way through the movie. The others are fine, but with the bad writing for the most part, they get lost and hopelessly confused so they seem odd and stupid.Then there's the action and filming. Holy god this is the most poorly shot movie I have ever seen in my life. The camera is shaking to the point of seasickness, like Man of Steel, but is doesn't benefit from poor editing. A lot of the sots in this movie last either a half a second or a half a frame before the scene is over. Then there are random shots and edits that make zero sense and provides the reason why I say this is an unbearable experience for the eyes and ears. Actually, we get a very good car chase at the beginning of the film and a cool aerial battle between a jet and an old Douglas DC-3, that's always great to watch. But other than that there are few and far between great action sequences.I've harped on this movie enough so I won't try to do anything more to it. But if I had to, I would recommend this one for one single viewing only. Is is the worst executed Bond film? Yes, yes it is. But does is have good things? On an occasion. Watch it once, but have vomit bags ready.Now onto the next greatest return to Bond-form, and my favorite Bond film, Skyfall.",3,5,7,29 October 2013
JFK," A Controversial but Technically Brilliant Film from Oliver Stone
","November 22, 1963 was one of the darkest days in American history. It was the day President John F. Kennedy was shot dead riding in his limousine through the city of Dallas, Texas. With today being the 50th anniversary of the assassination, I have decided to review Oliver Stone's controversial film about not only that day in Dallas, but all of the controversy and conspiracy theories that have surrounded it from moment one. JFK is actually a movie about New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) who takes it upon himself to bring to trial the people he believes conspired to murder the president. He and his staff do not believe that Lee Harvey Oswald (played eerily similar to his historical counterpart by Gary Oldman) simply acted alone, and as it turns out everyone he talks to has a theory about what the really happened, but every time they try to formally question them the 'witnesses to conspiracy' end up changing their view or end up dead. Garrison does bring a man he believes was directly involved, Clay Shaw (played by Tommy Lee Jones) to trial and tries to prove that it was all a big lie and a conspiracy exists. The acting is full of very recognizable stars in good roles, even though some are only there ever so briefly that it works against itself, or some historically inaccurate. Costner gives a heroic portrayal of Jim Garrison, whom I think represents Stone's view of the assassination, even though most people know that his real investigation was questionable in his grounds of prosecution, and that he was extremely obsessive about a conspiracy theory. The supporting cast is great and they are great actors, but some completely disappear even though they are all supposed to be involved. The screenplay, written by Oliver Stone and co-writer Zachary Sklar, is something of which I consider to be a brilliant mystery (something that works unbelievably well even though it really shouldn't) My major problem with the story is that both writers try to cram in way too many conspiracy theories. I myself do not believe most of these theories presented, especially when there is incontrovertible evidence against the theories Stone crams in. For example, modern computer animation by animator Dale Myers, ballistics experts, and even the evidence found in the Book Depository have proved the 'multiple bullet theory' to be false. However, with these falsehoods in mind, the film does raise some eyebrows about some inconsistencies with the investigation. I hate to say, but some (a very small amount) of these theories could hold water, but we would have to fully research these ideas and think formulate our own opinions. Like I said at the beginning of the review, this movie has been called one of (some call it the most) controversial films of all time. Many critics and people who were there believe that this movie is very manipulative and completely full of falsehoods and not one shred of truth. I think that people have blindly seen this movie without educating themselves about either the theories or what happened during the actual assassination. Instead of blindly believing everything the movie throws at us, we really have to look into it and study it for ourselves.But the way the film is executed and filmed is what makes this a classic, and one of the reasons why it appears on my all time favorite films list. The cinematography is so amazing and beautiful that sometimes you question whether or not it's real (another reason why it seems manipulative) Director of Photography Robert Richardson uses the same kind of film stock and cameras that existed in 1963 and before to frame the story in the best way possible. And then there's the editing, which best sums up the feelings of the assassination, which is truly chaotic. The editing is so great in that it forces us to look at all the details and try to keep up with what's going on. Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia did a fantastic job with it and kind of set a standard for kinetic editing that hasn't really been matched in recent years. It also makes sense that both these areas won Academy Awards.Oliver Stone considers this film to be greatest personal achievement. I, in all honesty, would have to agree with his sentiment. Many think that Stone has tried to manipulate people to match his now ultra-radical views, but he does what a director should be allowed to do. I think what Stone is trying to do is present his anger and confusion about someone who represented the hopes and dreams (his dreams as well) of America being madly gunned down like that, in a way that is more personal and daring than directors and producers were willing to go at that time. Every director should have a view of things and an opinion to present, not to follow the norm or keep quiet.This film is amazing to watch and is one of those rarities for me in Hollywood, a film to challenge us, make us think, and research about what is presented to us. Some have and will continue to blindly accept what they see in this film and others as fact, which can be dangerous, but still, we have people who are smart enough to know what is true and what is 'Hollywood.' For many people, the movie JFK truly represents the lack of closure and anger we still feel for what happened 50 years ago today.",8,3,10,22 November 2013
Schindler's List," Spielberg' Finest Artistic Achievement
","Candles slowly burn during the Shabbat in a Jewish household. After many hours of burning and illumination, the flame goes out and gives off ominously rising smoke and reveals the black and white image that snuck in as the candles shrunk. Such is the tone that is set for the rest of the film Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg's tribute/justice to the millions of Jewish people slaughtered during the Holocaust.This particular chapter of the Holocaust is the portrait of the mysterious Oskar Schindler, and his actions during the war in Poland. We see him begin as an opportunist businessman, who wines and dines with the Nazi higher ups in exchange to receive funding for a factory he wishes to profit from. For both parties, Jews are considered 'cheap labor,' therefore Schindler hires Itzhak Stern to handle rounding up a workforce in his new factory. Stern is really trying to save as many people as the 'Herr Direktor' will allow from certain death. Over the course of the film, something changes in Schindler that drives him to save 'his Jews' because he begins to realize the atrocities being committed around him, and that he must make a difference, even at the risk of losing his life in the process.Every actor in this film is perfect, no matter how big or small the role is. Liam Neeson gives his best work here as the complicated Schindler. It could have been a stereotypical 'revelation' motivated performance, but Neeson never condescends to a perfunctory level. He is complimented in his performance by Ben Kingsley as the loyal and determined Stern. The actor who steals the film is Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth. He, like Neeson, has the hardest task of any actor, to give humanity to someone who is morally reprehensible on paper. His is one of those performances that was robbed of the recognition it deserved.Much like the film The Shawshank Redemption, this film delves into the souls of the people in the middle of a dark situation. Schindler himself is an enigma. here we have a man who begins thinking about only himself and his money, but realizes what his actions mean in the big picture of what's going on. As the film progresses, he begins to care about the people he has saved, and pours every ounce of energy and every cent of his money to make sure that they do not suffer the same fate as those who couldn't be saved. The character of Stern acts as his moral compass, convincing his boss that what he is doing is right. He does not always agree with his boss' logic, but works to make sure no one is killed or taken away to the ovens. The evil incarnate character Amon Goeth, is also conflicted by his feelings about this whole affair for one reason. He too hates the Jews with a brainwashed passion, but ironically falls in love with his Jewish housemaid. He struggles to come to terms with this fact while still managing to shoot Jews at random for sport.Director Steven Spielberg and writer Steve Zaillian take a really smart approach to the material, by not making the characters one-dimensional or motivated by a cheap cliché. We are never really clued into what makes Schindler change his mind about his workers until the very end of the film, which is a brilliant storytelling masterstroke.There is absolutely nothing glamorous at all in this film, which lends its greater sense of verisimilitude. The cinematography is in black-and-white, as it should be. If it had been in color, it would have been all wrong. Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski shoot this like a documentary, lending itself to far more realistic shots and actions than a straightforward drama. The violence is truly gut-wrenching and sickening, but again, it is an accurate view of what happened in real life. The disturbing image of bodies burning and the billowing smoke from the Auschwitz chimney won't leave one's mind for years after seeing this film. The girl in the red coat is the most haunting image from the film, as the filmmakers wished to convey the confusion of how people didn't even know this was happening, even though it 'stuck out like a girl wearing a red coat.' Spielberg knew just when to add color to the film, the moments when there is true despair or hope at the end of the filmThis film is made all the more haunting because of the first-rate score by John Williams. Backed with the violinist Itzhak Perlman, Williams delivers one of the best scores in eternity, and one that is never overblown. Both use their beauty to convey a dark passage in history, but most importantly, to highlight the success of the people saved. At a first glance, it would seem Spielberg was the wrong man to make this film, as his focus in his early career was on entertainment films and escapist images. With this film, we see him blossom into a true artist. He does not mince images or words in this film whatsoever. He presents the events depicted like it was, stark and hopeless. Spielberg so poured his heart into this material that it was reported that he sobbed every day during filming, but wouldn't relent in telling this story. This film is the greatest achievement in his career, not only in terms of Oscars and recognition, but his transformation as an artist.",10,9,13,7 February 2014
The Longest Day," Arguably the Greatest War Film of Eternity
","**This Review May Contain Spoilers**There are many great war films. They are in a class by themselves, and can never be replaced. However some are the more elite, effectively capturing a time and crucial moment in history we might not have known much about. This is one of them. Darryl F. Zanuck's The Longest Day is possibly the best of the elite war films, and one of the greatest of all time. The key comes from the realistically staged and recreated invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. He could have made it a overly American film, and it would have been forgotten. But Zanuck put his heart and soul into the film and tries to present each side with dignity and honor. And with success.For instance when Pluskat sees the invasion coming, it is darkly funny. But this is not to make Pluskat look like an idiot Nazi, it made it so he is a guy doing his job and frightened of whats coming toward him. Another when Richard Burton and Richard Beymer sit and smoke waiting for the Allies, they get into deep thoughts about the war. They are indeed patriotic soldiers, but they are tired, frustrated, and sick of the war. That is inspired writing, directing, and casting. I believe the greatest moment is delivered by Curt Jurgens at the end when he realizes he won't stop the Allies. The subtlety is unrivaledEvery cast member has his own story and moment, and all is executed flawlessly. it can be a long movie at the start, but once the invasion begins, you are on pins and needles the entire time.One of the greatest films.

Lincoln," The Director and The Actor Shine in this Excellent Film
","Imagine to yourself for one moment, 'What if Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis teamed up?' Well, this is the beautiful result of these talents fusing themselves together. Lincoln is no ordinary film. It doesn't fall into any category of biopic or historical fiction film. When you watch this film, you are watching the moment. You are there, seeing and hearing it. This film is not about the life of Abraham Lincoln from childhood to the bullet at Ford's Theatre, but rather a short time span, the battle to pass the 13th Amendment. I had no idea that it was only this, so I was genuinely surprised. It is rather interesting to see Lincoln get down and dirty to get votes, but not dirty enough to lose our respect for him. All this comes down to Tony Kushner's witty, informative, and taut screenplay based on Doris Kerns Goodwin's novel 'Team of Rivals.'But the sparks really come from Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. We are very used to seeing Lincoln as a deep voiced monument, unflappable and stoic. Here, Lewis makes him a very good man, but has his flaws and limited patience with failure. He's a country man who loves to tell stories (even if some people hilariously don't care for them.) He also understands how important the amendment is for future generations and for ending the war, something his cabinet doesn't fully understand because they lack his farsightedness. This is his finest performance by far, which is saying something.The supporting cast is extensive. They range from actors of this generation, lost actors from old, and some you totally wouldn't expect. Tommy Lee Jones gives an outstanding portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens, even better than his role in 'The Fugitive.' Sally Field is good as Mary Todd Lincoln, but not great compared to all the hype surrounding her. David Strathiarn is perfect and the others give great work as well.Steven Spielberg is finally back on top, delivering some of his best work since Saving Private Ryan. He has been in a rut for a while, and here he is passionate, driven, and inspired to tell this story. He has one of the best ensemble casts in a recent film, and handles each with dignity, transforming them into their historic counterparts. he even wore a suit while directing this film, something he rarely ever does, signifying his commitment and dedication to the project. I tip my hat to the man.I tip my hat to this film, one of the best of this decade.",9,1,3,4 March 2013
The Dark Knight," A Genre-Defying Spectacle (One of the all-time Greatest Films)
","Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight changed things forever. There's no going' back. It is one of the few films that was thought to be one thing, and ended up becoming one of the greatest films of all time. This was the first movies I saw where I talked about things that were discussed in the film itself, and what it must mean to be a hero like Batman. But more importantly, the acting, writing, directing, and the cinematography make this a rich and tragic film that will forever stand the test of time.The story begins a couple months after the events of 'Batman Begins' (in a noticeably more realistic Gotham City) and batman has petty criminals and the mob running scared. The determined new D.A., Harvey Dent, emerges as another symbol of hope for Gotham City, albeit a more lawful position as Batman. Then, enter The Joker, a demented terrorist who sets up unbelievably dark and twisted situations to test the moral compasses of Batman, Dent, and even Commissioner Gordon. As a man, Bruce Wayne has a crisis, is Batman doing more harm than he is good? he learns that he may become something more awful than the Joker just to stop him.Director Christopher Nolan leaves behind all the jokiness and sometimes unfulfilled soul searching of the previous Batman films and with his trilogy, this more than others redefines what a superhero movie can be. He shows the characters for what they are, flawed but idealistic, as well as struggling to deal with the Joker as they themselves descend into a very dark place. Nolan, and his brother Jonathon, have given us a very polished and well thought out story by itself. This is the second film where I actually paid attention and love the story, characters, and became emotionally invested (the first was Toy Story long ago) And then there is the acting. The acting is top notch by all actors. The real star of this movie is the scene-stealing Joker, played by Heath Ledger. He transforms the Joker from all previous incarnations and puts a very demented and modern twist on it. He truly believes he is humanity fully realized and an agent of chaos (the theme of the film) He wants to turn the Gothamites into wild animals who will, according to him, 'eat each other, when the chips are down.' Ledger very deservedly, although posthumously, won the Oscar for this portrayal, and is still being hailed as one of the best villains in any medium.Christian Bale is in top form as Bruce Wayne/Batman and gives you a tender and heartbreaking side to the character. He does begin to build his mythos but struggles when people doubt him and push their fears onto what he stands for. I will say the actor who really got me invested was Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Two-Face is one of the more tragic villains of the Batman rogue's gallery. He is a truly moral and good man fallen from grace by tragedy in his life, losing Rachael to one of Joker's vicious traps (It hurts Bruce too, in a love triangle that for once in my life I thought was very well constructed and perfect) He becomes an evil and twisted brute who relies on a coin to make a decision to kill for him. 'Chance. Unbiased, Unprejudiced, FAIR.' He too was a villain I thought equal to the Joker, but in a different way. it is rather emotional when things happen to him, and that is the sign of a great storytelling and acing approach. Commissioner Gordon, played by Gary Oldman, presents a man who knows the system is corrupt, but remains idealistic and knows that Batman is doing good for the city. And at the end knows he will have to atone and be accountable for any sins he may have committed over the course of the film.The action scene are a wonder to behold. They look real and was pulled off with little to no computers, all real stunts. Nothing was over the top at all, even Two-face's design looked scary, and oddly enough, like he got burned by something on one half of his body. Every incarnation before this looks awful by comparison. Every scene in this film showcases cinematographer Wally Pfister's rich color palette/lighting scheme and his keen eye for detail even in the simplest scenes. He and Nolan will go down as one of the great cinematographer/director duos ever.This film is a a perfect work of art. The Dark Knght really was a game changer when released in 2008, showing the industry and fans what a 'comic-book movie' can be just as Richard Donner's Superman had done in 1978. This is a movie that I loved dearly on my first screening, and one that will not disappear off my list.",10,2,4,30 August 2013
Titanic," A Masterpiece from James Cameron
","Once in every decade since the inception of the motion picture camera, comes a film that seems to transcend criticism and stands the test of time as one of the all time greats. Such is the case with James Cameron's magnum opus, Titanic. This epic recreation of the ocean liner's ill-fated maiden voyage offers everything one can ask for, and more. There is spectacle and dramatic images that sticks with viewers for a very long time.The film begins as a frame story, with a 101 year old survivor, Rose (played by Gloria Stuart), telling a team of treasure hunters and scientists her experience on the Titanic. As a younger woman (now played by Kate Winslet) Rose traveled in first class on the Titanic with her materialistic mother and her haughty fiancée Cal (played by Billy Zane) Rose feels completely suffocated by the stiff and mind numbing activities and chatter that comes with being rich, and wants to break out and just do something exciting. Her life changes when she meets third-class artist Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) As the two talk and hang out more and more, they begin to fall for one another. Of course, her mother and fiancée disapprove mainly because he is poor. Everything comes to head when the ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink to her inevitable doom. Some people have made the joke to death that this film is essentially 'Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic.' I see this as only somewhat true, as there are indeed similar elements, but the real story would detract from a by-the-numbers correlation between the stories. Here the love story really works on many levels. Rose and Jack do not fall in love at first sight. When they start talking with one another, they see that they do have much in common. It takes a few days but they decide that they are best for each other and fall completely in love.Cameron has done something very special with all the characters characters in this film. He has always been noted for putting characters and interactions above the story, and so he does here too. Jack, Rose, Cal, Ruth, and Lovejoy are all fictional characters of course, but they all interact very convincingly with the real-life characters. In this way, when the ship sinks, the audience has built up and emotional connection to both fictional and real characters, allowing for more heartbreaking truth when most of the characters die or are in peril when the ship is sinking.The casting of this movie is phenomenal. I have to credit casting director Mali Finn and Cameron for really finding great actors, and some of the best character actors in the business. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet forever made a splash (no pun intended) as two of Hollywood's best leading actors, and have so far proved that they are two of the best.When production began on this film, Cameron knew partial sets and models simply wouldn't do. So he and his crew went out and actually built a huge version of the ship, carpets and all. He is a perfectionist, therefore everything on the ship had to be artistically and physically correct, to lend a greater sense of verisimilitude when the audience viewed it in 1997. It looks simply breathtaking, and we feel like we have been transported to the actual ship itself. As far as we know, Cameron probably knows the Titanic than anyone, so when its shown here in its glory, we believe it. Of course, Titanic is about the sinking of the 'unsinkable' ship. The final hour of the film is indeed the most gripping, as we see the ship start slipping beneath the waves. Cameron uses his extensive knowledge of special effects to very convincingly present the sinking in all of its gruesome truth. Its very well paced, finely edited, and of course, spectacular. And what makes it even more moving is we have gotten to know the characters and therefore its very heartbreaking when most of them die. The aftermath is of course, very tragic and cruel, because we all know what happened. But when it came on screen, we were still broken by it. When those who couldn't get into the lifeboat drown, we wish in our hearts that they could have. There is more her that will shock viewers, but I wouldn't dream in a million years of revealing the ending of Jack and Rose's story arc.Just as I claimed for Steven Spielberg directing Schindler's List, here, it initially seems like James Cameron is the wrong man for the job at first glance. He is known for action films, no romances or dramas. Yet somehow, this is the greatest film he has ever done. He directs with a keen vision, and is quite unrelenting in getting his vision across, hence why many people despise working with him. But his passion and dedication to the project shines through all the way through its three hour running time. Such dedication won the film multiple Oscars (11 to be precise) Cameron himself took home 4 in one night, cementing his status as one of the most successful filmmakers of our generation.This is one of the best films to grace the cinema. The sheer might and size of the picture doesn't dwarf the actors, who are given the chance to breath and connect us to one of the most infamous tragedies in history. A sharp criticism of man's hubris, and a stirring tribute to those who lost their lives that night. Such is how I can describe Titanic.",10,3,6,13 February 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Great for Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow, Horrid Chastain Brings it Down
","**This Review Contains Some Spoilers**The sounds of the 9/11 calls from the planes and the towers drew me in, as i believed this would be really epic and an awesome portrayal of how everyone felt and how everything went down. And the cut after deflated the film and set the tone for what would happen.Is there torture? Yes, but it doesn't glorify it like the politicians have been saying. However, it doesn't demonize it, showing it did get us very vital intelligence that we desperately needed. Then the movie drags for about an hour and a half. The last half hour is one of the best sequences I have seen in a long time, but the key moment is a let down. Unlike Titanic, where you knew the ending but it was awesome to see and experience how it happened, in this film the moment happens, and it's just like, 'Oh yeah that happened, nothing important.'Now we get to what should be the strongest bones of the movie, Jessica Chastain's performance. WHERE DO I BEGIN? She comes in unannounced, reacts to something, and yells at her bosses. I give her credit s after a colleague dies (which the colleague is made out to be a complete moron when it comes to protocol) she does show some genuine emotion. But that is brief. I felt that Bigelow and Boal made their biggest mistake with this character. I wanted to punch in one scene where she badgers her boss about the compound. I wanted to scream at her, but being in a theater that would have been rude. I can sum up here character like this. She found Osama, she actually does work, she is the first American to see him after the mission, It's all because of her. Here's the biggest insult to the audience, she makes everyone else, who spent years and countless hours trying to hunt this guy down, look like complete IDIOTS. (One man: 75% he's there; Another man; 40%, we have no strong evidence; Chastain: 100% he's there 'I am the one who found that man') I can't care for her, which storytelling really counts on for a film like this. If she wins an Oscar, it is not well deserved at all.Boal's screenplay can get murky sometimes, but it's still a solid script, even with Chastain's character in it. If he wins, good for him. I do think Bigelow was unfairly snubbed, but I think it was because how she handled Chastain.So, like I said before, it is entertaining. It will never, ever match The Hurt Locker, which is the better film from the Bigelow-Boal team.'For God and Country, Geronimo!'P.S. How dare they make Kyle Chandler from Friday Night Lights an idiot! How dare they!",7,0,3,21 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star Wars Month #6: The Saga Goes Out in Excellent Fashion
","This was the big one. We were finally going to see how it went down. The pressure Lucas was under when creating Revenge of the Sith was unimaginable, especially considering the fans had savaged his last two films. But come Memorial Day weekend in 2005, the expectations were SURPASSED. Revenge of the Sith was considered to be the best of the Prequel Trilogy, but for me it is the best film in the series since Empire Strikes Back.The Clone Wars are coming to an end, and it seems the Republic will stand tall once more, but an inevitable danger lurks beneath. Anakin Skywalker is at odds with the Jedi Council, and somewhat his mentor Obi-Wan. The headmasters don't trust him and feel he may not be the Chosen one after all. His wife Padme announces her pregnancy, which he is overjoyed over, but becomes fearful when he sees vivid premonitions of her dying in childbirth. Chancellor Palpatine, the Sith Lord, seduces Anakin to the Dark Side, as he promises it is the only way to save Padme from dying. Thus, the extermination of the Jedi is set into motion as well as the rise of the First Galactic Empire, and Anakin must confront Obi Wan in a duel to the death.The true genius of George Lucas' writing is that he doesn't try to surprise us with anything, but he gives a Shakespearean tragedy sense to it. His transformation is not because he wants to be evil, but because he wishes to save Padme's life, as he has had recurring visions of her death. Palpatine, who is the equivalent of the devil in this universe, promises him that the only way to save her is to use Sith powers. The key to this idea's success is Hayden Christensen. I blasted him in the last film, but here, he does a really solid job. He sells the fact that he doesn't want to lose the person he loves the most.Lucas' character connections were admittedly not as strong in the last ones, especially when you look at the acting in this installment. The acting here is top notch, and the sparks between characters hearkens back to Empire Strikes Back. The biggest improvement in this film is Hayden Christensen. Unlike the last film where he was sleepwalking through, here there is a character and a more likable approach to Anakin. When you see him go down the wrong path, it is heartbreaking, and when he loses the very thing he wanted to protect, the last goodness of him is practically gone forever. Every other character is great to begin with, and each actor's story is given equal amount of weight and gravitas. The is easily the darkest of all the Star Wars films. It starts out in a light and adventurous mood, but then descends into darkness and disturbing images. The scenes when Anakin turns to the Dark Side and goes on the massacre is truly depressing, as you have come to care for the good man that he was, yet you also understand really why he does such things. But the third act is really taking place in Hell, the lava planet Mustafar, and the images are some of the most striking in any film in the last ten years. The climax between Obi Wan and Anakin is truly electrifying, but is then balanced out by the gravitas of the last goodness of Anakin being burned off. Warning, that scene will not leave you for quite some time after viewing.Every technical area of this film works on such a high level that I had taken it for granted for a long time. The music is great, obviously it will be because its John Williams doing the score. The effects are so eye popping and busy, that you notice more and more of them with every viewing, which is really not a bad thing. This film is a complete return to form for not only George Lucas, but for the franchise in general. Revenge of the Sith proved that with hard work and lot of thought put into the material, it can stand the test of time and provide entertainment for people of all ages. The themes and ideas presented are really strong, and the execution of the story is flawless. This is the best film in the series since Empire Strikes Back, and will always be one I look to forward to watch.",9,6,10,3 February 2014
Inception," The Most original, Thoughtful, and Utterly Great Film
","**This Review Can Contain Spoilers**This film is a game-changer. Riding high on the success of 'The Dark Knight,' Christopher Nolan decided to do this one project that he worked for years on. By God does the result show his dedication! This is one of the most complex films in terms of plot, characters, and motivations. The script not only goes into the mind, it goes into the different layers of each person's mind and does what a fabulous script should do. It throws huge twists, makes some smart story choices, and describes fantastic situations (like Paris folding on top of itself) It is a mortal sin that he did not win the Oscar and was beaten by a bland forgettable film i will not mention (*cough* *cough* The King's Speech)The cast is beyond exceptional, with one exception. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a knockout performance, as usual. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was excellent, along with the always incredible Ken Watanabe, and a newcomer named Tom Hardy. The rest are equally fine, with Cillian Murphy giving the performance of his lifetime. The one drawback is Ellen Page. After watching her stale performance in Juno, I hoped she would be better here. Not really, but she did help keep the plot moving, credit for that.The look of this film. One single word, PERFECTION. Nolan uses his regular crew from The Dark Knight, and uses them to an even greater degree. Wally Pfister gives his greatest work as a cinematographer, using different tones and lighting for each level of the mission. The special effects are a breath of fresh air from CGI, hell there is very little CGI, mostly models and gimbals, like the Hallway (one of the best scenes from any movie ever) Hans Zimmer is in top shape, with the track 'Time' as his most emotional piece.I can't talk enough about this movie, it would be a sin for me to reveal any of the plot to anyone. It's really to watch and take it as it unfolds. I would give this film 20/10, but I cannot unfortunately. It was an epiphany for me, showing me that movie can be fun, original, and how much dedication and vision can give the world a movie to treasure forever. It blew me away, and i left the theater cheering.This Dream Became The Reality for the greatest filmmaker of this generation.",10,1,4,22 January 2013
Casino Royale," Bond Month #21: Wow! What a Great Bond Film!!!
","Before I talk about this extraordinary film, I'll give you a little background on the feeling of Bond at the time. 9/11 happened a couple of months before Die Another Day. That movie was viewed as lame and not the kind of Bond people felt was appropriate anymore. The question became, How to make Bond relevant in the post 9/11 environment? Casino Royale is the answer to this question. It is smart, tense, emotional, and above all, real. This is one of the finest in the series, so let me try to say my piece about it.The plot comes right back to the espionage that made Bond famous, but of course with the modern twist on it. People have joked that you can put 'Bond Begins' as the title, as if it was similar to Batman Begins. Well, it is his origin story, before he becomes the Bond we all know today. Heck this was the first Bond book ever written, yet somehow the 21st movie made. Hollywood politics for you, but I don't care, its a fantastic reboot.Newly minted Agent 007 James Bond has to track down and bring to justice a broker named Le Chiffre, who supplies terrorists with money by destroying the competition. In order to bankrupt Le Chiffre and extort protection by MI6, Bond has to beat him an a poker tournament. Bond however is monitored by British banker Vesper Lynd, who Bond falls in love with, I think.The acting in this movie is absolutely top notch. Daniel Craig, the first blond-haired Bond, is spectacular as Bond. He is the most physical and most intense Bond, but unlike Timothy Dalton, has the perfect blend of intensity and humor. He is a hard man who often doesn't like his job, but has some strange over-sense of loyalty to MI6 and M, played again by Judi Dench. Vesper joins my list of Tracy and Natalya as my absolute favorite Bond girls of all time. She is so smart and beautiful that it would be hard not to like her at all. She is also very complex and its revealed that there is more than her icy and controlled exterior. Le Chiffre is also a different kind of villain, he wants money, but that is because he is in debt and doesn't want to die. That's why his eye leaks blood, its when he feels anxious or when he is bluffing. This aspect initially seems over the top, but it seems real as it goes.There is of course action. This action is beyond insanely amazing. We have an awesome opening with dangerously high jumps across construction cranes and rooftops, and then a great truck chase on an airport tarmac, and a huge fight in a sinking Venice house at the end. The action is truly a wonder to behold. They are nicely shot and edited, so everything is in focus.This movie is truly amazing piece of cinema, and does what a movie should do. It presents amazingly written characters, and exquisite direction to give us an engrossing story for us to invest in. Even those who don't get poker, especially me, even those scenes give us enough understanding as to what is going on in the minds of those involved.There are actually two scenes that I see as two of the best scenes in any movie.1) After a brutal fight that Vesper had to become involved in, she is in shock and sits in the cold shower an tries to wash of the blood. Bond sits in and joins her, warms up the water and she puts her head in his shoulder. That is so romantic but it is not overdone at all and Craig sells a very compassionate side of Bond.2) After the tournament, Bond and Vesper are kidnapped, and Bond is tortured. It is lifted directly from Fleming's book, but is updated to a rusty ship and a knotted rope to hit Bond's family jewels. This proved to audiences that Craig certainly had balls of steel for the role of Bond (every pun intended) Martin Campbell came back to direct the movie and I am so happy he did. Just like GoldenEye, he had his own modern ideas of what should be done with a Bond film, and executes everything beautifully. But the writers have an amazing contribution to the story. There is actually a genuine plot twist that I won't dream of revealing and actually improves a problem I had with the original book. Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and newcomer Paul Haggis really updated this for all audiences.I absolutely loved this movie when I saw it in 2006, and so did a lot of critics. it will go down in history as one of the best Bonds out there.This signaled the fresh new era of Bond, RRRIIIIGGGHHHHTTTT before Quantum of Solace comes along two years later, yeah that one was obviously coming. Brace yourselves, the review will not be kind to it.",9,2,5,28 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars Month #1: One of the Best Films Ever (Hollywood's Modern Trailblazer)
","When George Lucas created his galaxy far, far away, no one believed it would be anything more than a dismal failure. It had modern special effects concepts that no one understood, casting and characters that went against the normal mentality, and above all things, it was science fiction (not a bankable genre at the time) But when the film was released in May 1977, all the doubts were immediately blasted away and the film became an international and cultural icon.Star Wars is one of those films that takes risks and presents what people can do with a lot of imagination, determination, and a lot of sweat. George Lucas changed cinematic technique forever with this movie. He applied universal themes and classic good vs. evil to a story with mind-blowing effects and a grand spectacle for all ages to come.This particular (now fourth but at the time first) chapter of the long (six-film) story involves the adventure of a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker as he is swept into joining the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire. He encounters many obstacles and tight situations along the way, before becoming the very hero of the Rebellion. This story, inspired by old space serials on television, may seem initially basic. But the way Lucas conceives his characters and the themes of the story is what makes it truly fresh and original. this begins Luke's emotional journey to becoming a Jedi warrior, and his understanding of a mysterious energy called 'the Force.' This film has classic characterizations, which makes all the more universally appealing. Luke is our innocent blank slate, who becomes just as invested as we do, but he isn't boring. he is a headstrong youth who will jump in feet first if he must. Han is very cynical, but ultimately sees what's important in the end and becomes a good friend. Leia is a not so typical damsel-in-distress. She is much like Luke in spirit, but projects some kind of wisdom beyond her years, which has become typical around Lucasfilm these days, but its not a bad thing. Alec Guinness expertly plays the wise mentor, Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who imparts his wisdom of the force onto Luke and the past story of the now prequel trilogy. Now comes the symbol of all evil in this universe, Darth Vader (physical performance by David Prowse, voice by James Earl Jones) Darth Vader is more famous than the movie itself, and has become the symbol of Star Wars. His commanding presence is terrifying.What separates Star Wars from other films is its distinctive look and effects. The very impressive sets, designed and built in England by Superman designer John Barry, evokes a sleek but what Lucas called 'used atmosphere.' The reason why we buy that these things and sets are for real is that they look like they have been used and lived in for years, and that we can see the rivets and tiniest of details on the models used for the effects. The effects are some of the best that I have and ever will see. All the films in the saga have great effects as well, though some of them have better effects more than others. Just the frenetic pacing and fast action is enough to satisfy any movie goer.I will say, Star Wars isn't Star Wars without John Williams. His greatest known and successful score adds this level of timelessness that Lucas was trying to achieve. The famous fanfare is used everywhere now, as it heralds greatness. Lucas and Williams agreed that this score should be full of motifs and themes that would give an 'emotional anchor' that may not have come across otherwise. While there is the grand and bellicose music for the action, there are very sweet and emotional themes punctuated throughout, making the experience of watching this film even greater.I can't say enough about this magical movie that uses movie magic to its advantage. It's fun, imaginative, and overall just outstanding. The start of the Saga is excellent.",9,2,4,10 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Star Wars Month #2: An Dark, Interesting, and Outstanding Sequel
","After Star Wars was a smash hit in 1977, a sequel was put into the works. The Empire Strikes Back is one of those sequels that is equal to the original, while still being its own film. While I can't personally say it's the best film of the Saga, it comes pretty darn close.As with any second film in a trilogy, we begin after an unspecified amount of time following the Battle of Yavin. The rebels are discovered on the ice planet Hoth, and are promptly defeated by the Imperial Walkers. Our main group is split up into separate teams. Luke, following advice from the force ghost of Obi Wan, seeks out the wise teacher Yoda (a puppet played in a stunningly real performance by puppeteer Frank Oz) who teaches him the true power and meaning of the Force. Leia and Han, along with Chewie, Threepio and R2, are pursued by the Empire for use as bait in a trap by Darth Vader.For a film that has no real beginning or end story-wise, this film has more emotion and character study, exactly what George Lucas and director Irvin Kershner wanted. During his experiences with Yoda, Luke develops an inner conflict about Darth Vader and the Dark Side, and that he must confront this evil in a duel. We as an audience also learn the power of the Force, which is further strengthened as a religious idea, such as Yoda's line, 'You must FEEL the force AROUND you.' Such material is what makes Empire great, is that we move deeper and deeper into darker and more thoughtful thematic material. The real interesting part of this film is the big reveal in the third act, where Vader reveals Luke's true parentage. It is simply one of the greatest scenes to ever grace the movie screens, and such an emotional pull that we still get lost in the moment even though we all know who he is now.On the opposite side, the stuff on Leia and Han's side of the film is good, but not great. Let me explain. The love story is actually very well done. There's not a lot of smooching and sappy sentiment, but it happens very naturally, along with some banter. Harrison Ford also delivers one of the best improvised lines when Leia says 'I Love You.' he simply says, 'I know.' Those are actors who really know their characters. But the rest it seems just to be 'funny' or unnecessary annoyance. Chewie and Threepio fit into this category, though Threepio is far more interesting than Chewie so... I guess I give him a pass.The rest of the movie is pretty good. The effects are unbelievable, the music is perfect, with John Williams giving us the universally loved 'Imperial March,' and the terrifying lightsaber duel between Vader and Luke being the highlight of the entire film.Its one of the best of the Saga. I say 'one of the best' because, for me, this ties with two of the other films, Episodes VI and III. All three of these films are on the top of the game and great films to watch. Onto the first in the sort of 'lackluster films the fans love to rip to shreds...",9,0,0,14 January 2014
The Social Network," A Great Film Technically and Emotionaly
","Back in 2010, I avoided this movie when it first came out because I wasn't really interested in Facebook and the poster looked strange. I was 100% wrong about this movie. David Fincher's 'The Social Network' is one of the finest films I have ever had the privilege of watching. This is a showcase for a great director, a fabulous writer, and a great cast of characters and actors.The story is about the inception of Facebook back in a dorm room of Harvard University. After a date goes wrong because he is too arrogant, Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) drunkenly creates the prototype of Facebook (called FaceMash) with his best (and ONLY) friend Eduardo Saverin (played by the brilliant Andrew Garfield) The resulting controversy lead the Winklevoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer) to hire Mark to develop an idea of theirs. Mark arrogantly steals the basis of the idea, improves upon it, and creates Facebook. Another big cat interested in Mark's new thing is Napster founder Sean Parker (played surprisingly well by Justin Timberlake) He manipulates Mark to screw Eduardo out of the company because he wants a big stake in the next big thing. All this plays out in flashback as we see Mark in the middle of two lawsuits simultaneously, one from the Winklevosses, and the other from Eduardo.One of the big keys in how the story plays out is Oscar Winner Aaron Sorkin's unique style of delivery and framing. He uses his trademark rapid-fire dialog and complicated characterizations to great effect. Of course no writer's script is gold without the right director to guide it to the screen. David Fincher works wonders here, giving us the proper mood inside the campus of Harvard and layered and nuanced performances. Both made the right choice of making the story a very cold one, even though we can root for some characters. Friendships are broken and it hurts.The cast is amazing, and unexpected. Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark as a cold conniving nerd who is stung by the fact that girls hate him because he's so arrogant. He wants to prove to everyone that he is worth something and that he isn't a nobody, even at the cold cost of losing his only friend Eduardo. Andrew Garfield (who I think was unfairly snubbed for an Oscar nod that year) has a lot of meat too. he may not be the right approach for getting Facebook off the ground financially, but his heart's in the right place and he is loyal to his friend, until his friend royally screws him and he comes after him with lawyers. I mention these two specifically because I feel that that's what the story is really about, these two friends driven apart by this uncontrollably growing monster. Justin Timberlake is deliciously cocky and manipulative as Sean, but he is also pretty brilliant about how to get Facebook off the ground. He's not really a villain, but he just wants another huge new creation under his belt to show off to others.I also have to mention, on the technical side, Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography and the editing by Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter. Cronenweth gives a strangely warm lighting against a cold story. What i mean is, it's warm and shaded during the Harvard scenes, and as soon as we meet Sean parker in Palo Alto, it become cold and more real. Like Wally Pfister, Croneweth know how to keep the audiences' attention to the detail and give them a rich palette to look at, but its there to tell the story. The editors Wall and Baxter compliment the story and the dialog beautifully. It finished the sentences, criss-crosses between the lawsuits and the flashbacks, and keeps the flow very well.This movie is a wonder. I am still shocked that it did not win Best Picture or Best Director for Fincher. It won a few (Score, editing, and Adapted Screenplay) but not the ones it was seriously predicted to win. And like my review for Inception suggests, both this and Inception were passed over for a safer film that is full of clichÃ©s and boring characters, The King's Speech. This a modern film for the ages. it tells a modern story with modern dialog and storytelling, but is still timeless. Its one of my top 10 favorites, and if you like Facebook or hate it, check it out anyway. It is a treat full of great characters and a tragic story of greed and lust for glory and acceptance.",10,1,2,19 September 2013
