Requiem for a Dream," Unique experience!
","Have you ever seen a movie that contains innovative cinematic shots and effects that simply stun you and make you watch this movie again and again? Have you ever seen in a movie not-widely-known actors performing as terrific as movie stars like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt? Have you seen a drama film, in which you would be experiencing sorrow but still loving the movie for sharing this feeling with you? Have you ever heard a soundtrack in a movie so astonishing, you would buy the recording and listen to it all day long? Have you ever dreamed about something and got your dream broken, and it was your fault? If you haven't yet - watch this movie. It's a must see.10/10",10,0,1,11 October 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Booooring
","There are people who hate this Saga, there are people who love it. I am neither hater, nor fan of it. And since I've seen only first movie, which in fact is not as bad as people might say, I didn't get annoyed or aspired by all the other parts. Basically, I took a neutral position when I went to see this movie in a cinema.I think, it would be appropriate to begin with a storyline. It is pretty solid and doesn't become clumsy over time. However, a lot of movie moments seem to be over dramatized or at least the plot is literally being sucked out of a finger. And the dialogs make the movie even more boring that it might have been.Unfortunately, poor acting only adds up negative points to movie. From time to time it was hard to believe that the main characters got any emotions.The final blow is brought by CGI effects. It's like if someone tried to make a movie with a 10-year old computer. That's clearly unacceptable for a high budget movie.If the movie was incredibly bad or annoying it would be at least fun to watch how it fails. But no it's not that kind of movies. It's soulless. It's an unpleasant experience. It's dull.3/10",3,8,10,3 December 2011
Lawrence of Arabia," Masterpiece
","'Lawrence of the Arabia' is not historically-accurate movie as one may think, judging by the title. However, it manages to prove itself as one of the greatest movie classics ever created.First of all, the movie achieves to portrait the vast landscapes, where the story takes place, in an adventurous and even romantic colors. The cinematography shots are definitely at its' peak in this movie. One may even feel like time-traveling back to those glorious events with the protagonist just to watch the beauty of the scenery that lies ahead of him or her.Second, the acting is mind-blowing, giving depth to the characters involved in the historical saga. Sometimes, it might be difficult to understand whether you see a real life person in front of you with incredibly complex character or is it just an actor portraying him. Anyone can clearly see how the values of main heroes affect every tiny bit of their difficult decisions.Third, the plot is not only perfectly executed, but is tightly connected to the scenery and personal struggle to make every single dream they have to come true. Actually, the events that take place make probably even more impact on main characters, leading to the final titles of the movie.Finally, the movie has one of the most memorable soundtracks, that will lie deeply in many hearts. Only a truly epic tale deserves to have such wonderful music.To cut the story short, this is a masterpiece created by David Lean. Forget about history for a while. Enjoy the movie.",10,2,5,10 January 2012
Gran Torino," Nearly perfect
","Every time a director goes for the movie that is a mix of drama, comedy and possibly an action, he accepts the risk of movie becoming boring mediocre and uninteresting. In such case a movie shouldn't be just good but instead should be polished to perfection.The movie is one of the examples of such movie. Clint Eastwood volunteered to be solely director and the protagonist of the movie. So from a certain point of view he presents how he views the character. And in fact over time as the story goes on we can see a fully developed character which shows his positive and negative traits, but undoubtedly appealing to the viewer's eyes.The other characters including the secondary ones are not paid that much attention but nevertheless you can always recognize in them a neighbor, a friend or any other person you may know in real life. Still, one particular performance - performance by Bee Vang started to diminish as soon as story went to an end. But that can be considered more as a minor flaw that doesn't spoil the overall impression.The plot itself and the script for the character dialogs doesn't seem to have any holes or lame excuses for having particular twists. In fact, the story seems to be reasonable and logical and most importantly close to any situation we might be dragged in real world.The other best thing about the movie is that movie is full of symbolical meanings that start from the title of it. They might have a particular meaning, but nonetheless it is a pleasure to interpret the movie the way you see it.In fact, the movie nearly reaches the perfection it supposed to achieve. There are several flows, like the one that was mentioned before in terms of acting or probably the unnecessary sound of drums that restates the obvious personality of the protagonist.Yet, they can easily be ignored since the movie gives a good overall impression. It's worth giving it a go.9/10",9,0,2,30 January 2012
Paranormal Activity," Under average
","There were many gossips about this movie the time I heard about it. People didn't want to sleep after watching it, many had no desire to watch the other two movies, simply because they were too scared. So I was curious about it.Main idea of the film is same as 'Blair witch project' or 'Rec' - to make things look more realistic. So, it is a movie, that is intentionally using an average camera for home using in order to provide such effect to make everything happening in movie look even scarier. And there comes the first problem - it is not original in such idea. At least it managed to provide the realistic atmosphere of all of the events in the movie.Then it is one of the rare movies, that has a really shallow plot, which I generally find disturbing, because every decent movie has a really good plot. And real time camera caption is not an excuse for it. In fact, you can always watch creepy videos throughout the internet without any plot, if you want to be scared.Then at some point the classical 'BOO' effect and protagonists screaming becomes really annoying. This was used in milliards of other horror movies and simply doesn't work over and over again.The characters themselves aren't well-developed. This makes the plot even more shallow than it is.Though it succeeded in creating tension from start of the movie, which solidly leads to final events.But overall, I expected much more from this movie. Though if you like the classic 'Boo' effects - than this movie is for you.4/10",4,0,0,25 November 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Simply bad.
","When I saw transformers first movie - it was pretty decent. The characters were awkward but that made the movie entertaining. The actions scenes were incredibly good. And the plot itself was great.When I saw the second part it was kindly disappointing because the acting wasn't as great as in first one, storyline was poor. But at least the action was a doze of adrenaline.Then I thought that maybe Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon will redeem itself. How naive I was. Now, what wrong with this movie?Let's begin with storyline - it is boring and some of the twists make it even more boring and unrealistic.The action sequences presented way less than the drama and comedy scenes. And I thought people go to view such movies for a lot of action and possibly bit of drama.The jokes by the secondary characters are plain and stupid. Only few jokes were to laugh at.Some of the scenes were made as if they were only made for a trailer. Don't believe me? Watch the trailer again after you watch movie.The greatest villain from previous movies was really pathetic. How comes? On the other hand, small transformers managed to influence the storyline more than him. Are you freaking kidding me? So, let's cut the long story short. It's a bad sequel, and I don't recommend to watch it. Even if you were fan of the first movie.",1,3,8,2 October 2011
