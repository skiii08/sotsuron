Hereditary," A great modern horror movie
","I think people when people think horror..they think of Hellraiser, Nightmire on elm street, because the bashing this is getting is ridiculous. Real horror, the horror of loss and depression..struggling to live with grief. Not all horror movies need to have blood and gore! Toni Collette runs the show a fabulous actress that almost turned the role down. It's not perfect as most I would agree the ending is abit meh but that doesn't mean this isn't a great film for me it's a horror film along the lines of Rosemary's baby it definitely has that inspiration behind it..it's a must watch and I think it will be appreciated more in years to come!",8,0,1,20 June 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Amazing
","Absolutely loved it, gave me a real appreciation of Queen that I never really had. I read the reviews before hand saying it was abit weak, as in not alot of drug use or about the aids, true they didn't go into it far enough for my liking but it kept it abit more upbeat. It wasn't a film just about Freddy it's a film about Queen.",9,1,3,27 October 2018
The Lion King," Visually amazing story Lazy
","The Lion King was one of if not my favourite film as a kid so I was always going to have this 'it will never be as good as the original' but I enjoyed the Jungle Book and Mowgli so I knew the enjoyment factor could still be there. Visually it's stunning Disney look like they have spent an absolute fortune on this and it shows, but a few things with it there is no emotion being shown like 0 you can't tell if they're happy sad angry the only relation you have is with the voice, and that brings me to the sound. You can tell that the voice actors have done this in a studio from the first word spoken I was taken a back with how out of sync it was it just didn't fit. The whole film is almost shot scene for scene with the original which isn't that old at all. Scar's voice just wasn't menacing enough for me he was no Jeremy Irons I can tell you that, everything seemed rush, the scene when Mufasa gets thrown off the cliff by scar when he utters the word 'long live the king' when Irons done it, it was slow, dark, scary like when the new actor does it, it's literally like they're having a normal conversation. I don't like the beyonce song the score was pretty much the same from the original. 6/10 is being generous from me, I would leave it for blu ray, I don't think the original is that old to justify a remake so soon and if you are going to do it change it up enough to make it worth while.",6,2,4,31 July 2019
The Lion King," Looks great has 0 soul
","Probably up there with the best CGI I've seen it's superb, but there is no soul no emotion in the voice actors it's almost seen for seen but just nowhere near as good..and Beyonce another singer that fancys another career path to add to the list.",6,1,2,21 February 2020
Coco," Amazing!
","I held off seeing this for 3 years now, I don't know why I just never fancied this from Pixar so I decided to give it a go. What a film, you can just tell how much time and research went into the Mexican history and heritage, pixar just never seizes to amaze me! excellent film and emotional.",9,0,0,15 March 2020
It Chapter Two," Not as good as Chapter 1
","It cheaper 2 is long..very long, somethings just aren't right with it. The whole point of pennywise is he thrives on fear but we seen a couple of deaths were there is no fear there's no build up it's just straight kill? If that is the case why is he pandering on and on with the losers club? The biggest problem I had with it was the CGI it's everywhere, whatever happened to some make up or prosthetics I just find it so lazy in hollywood these days. It's not a bad film nor is it great it's a good sequel very rarely you find a sequel better than the first and I'm afraid this is another to add to the first of films that aren't as great as the first. I feel like Pennywise wasn't in IT a great deal his character is so iconic I feel he should've got more screen time as Bill Skarsgard done a cracking job of the character.",7,8,17,7 September 2019
