The Hangover," Worst movie ever!
","This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I do not suggest it for anybody who did not watch this movie yet, just be sure that you did not miss anything. This movie is just a wasting of money! Characters are totally out of control and I do not think they are good models for youths so there should be also age limit for the movie. In addition, I could not find any useful subject in this film. I really can not understand why this movie is in the cinemas now? even this should not be on TVs. While I was watching, I thought to leave cinema salon for a moment to protest this horrible movie but anyway I did not like it at all and if you really like the good quality movies, sorry but this is not for you.",1,13,26,21 July 2009
