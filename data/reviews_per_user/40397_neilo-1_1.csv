Mission: Impossible III," It's good for what it is
","No block-buster movie that deals with spies/espionage is in anyway realistic. I wouldn't nick pick any movie in this genre, Bond or Bourne included. Bond has more glamour and panache, Bourne has more edge and grit, Mi:III is somewhere between the two. I remember coming away from the cinema saying, 'Wow! That was completely over the top' but I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was. A fantastic (unrealistic) but entertaining journey through a slightly shaky but appropriate storyline. If you want well thought out thrillers, rent a copy of 'The Ipcress File' or the like. If you want remote controlled jets blowing up bridges, rent a copy of this movie. You won't be disappointed.",8,4,5,11 December 2006
