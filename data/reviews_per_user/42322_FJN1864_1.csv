The Blair Witch Project," Why?
","Why am I still talking about this movie over 5 years later? It was (and still is) the most over-hyped , BAD movie ever made! I hope the film makers made enough to retire on! Luckily for me, I've only seen it once, and that was when a friend lent me the VHS tape. I can proudly state that I had nothing to do with this movie being a multi million dollar grossing film. If you get the chance, maybe this film will interest some of you out there. Then again, Attack of the Killer Tomato's is just as good. If you need to see this, see if any of your friends, relatives, or even the Public Library have copies you can borrow/ check out. Then watch in a dark room. You want to know what will probably happen? YOU'LL FALL ASLEEP FROM SHEER BOREDOM!!! If you like terror stay away from this STINKER!!",1,0,3,8 January 2005
