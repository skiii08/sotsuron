Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," You think you are the only one who can think like that!!!
","The moment I came to know that this movie was gonna be out, i was excited to watch it. Now the wait is over and this movie has not disappointed any Sherlock Holmes' fans. Its an absolute cracker of a movie and some may find it even better than the first one... The dialogues and the flow of the movie is absolutely brilliant. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude law.. when i see those two together.. i wonder whether they are a couple in real life... what a chemistry between these two!!! They can't show a better bonding in a movie... Who needs an actress?? ;) Robert Downey Jr's acting.. well what can you say... each of his movies is a treat to watch just coz of his acting alone.. Jared harris .. The villain... well it is amazing to see a villain who is as good as a hero... and it is a treat to watch the fight sequences which they create in their minds.. don't want to reveal much about it... Just go and watch the movie... you wont regret it... !",9,0,0,8 January 2012
Thor," Marvel :)
","I always think movies which are made out of comics are good but the movies which are made out of books may or may not be as good as the book itself. Thor is another example. The movie is interesting as well as entertaining. The effects are cool and Chris Hemsworth looks cool in the role. Anthony Hopkins -- no words... Whatever part you give him, he will blow you away.. Natalie could have been shown more glamorous ;) Personally I think the villain in this movie is a bit of a loser. Common there should have been a big fight. The villain cant lose that easily :D There could have been lot more. But not forgetting the movie revolves mainly around Thor and his character, so that should be expected. Overall.. This movie is worth a watch!",7,0,0,22 December 2011
Vanilla Sky," Great considering it was made in 2001
","**This review is only for those who want to watch this movie after 2011 ;) *** I watched this movie 10 years after this was released. So this movie may not seem that good. but considering it was made in 2001, this movie is a really good one compared to its counterparts. Penelope Cruz and cameroon diaz... who cares about their acting ;) tom cruz was good as always... cameroon diaz's role was very short but she has done an awesome job... the imagination is great and you may not understand whats going on for some time in the movie... well the best thing about the movie were its soundtracks... wowww.. just amazing.. in short, if you have not watched this movie.. go out and rent a DVD or watch it online... P.S. My rating may seem different from my review but i am writing this review considering the fact that this movie was made in 2001...",6,0,2,7 January 2012
