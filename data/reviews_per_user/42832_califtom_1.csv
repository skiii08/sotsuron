It," Great film but liked the first cast better
","I really enjoyed this incarnation of IT but I can't help but be biased simply because I am such a fan of the original. There were some things better about this film and some things better about the original, but what stood out most was the cast of kids in the original were vastly superior. Each character in the original had an unusual quality that made them stand out in some way while the kids in this film just kind of blended in with the crowd. The Ritchie Tozier character in the original played by Seth Green was far better and I was a bit let down they took away most of what made him so funny and unique with the gags and jokes and stuff. They also left out Ben's backstory about his father who died in the war and the fact he and his mother were forced to live with relatives. That was an important part of the storyline I don't think they should have omitted. The story telling overall was better in the original with the way the group came together. The story in the current film did feel rushed at times but overall a very enjoyable movie.",9,5,9,16 September 2017
