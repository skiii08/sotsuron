The Avengers," Truly Perfect Superhero Films..
","I went into this movie with very high expectations cause I watched all the trailers about 30 times each. I will say from the very first 10 minutes of the films I was instantly blown away by the action and the course of the story. All the characters in this film get an equal amount of screen time, which is usually the problem in a film where you deal with multiple characters such as in this film. I applaud Joss Whedon for making this Marvel Masterpiece, the way everything fits together in this film is truly amazing and its close to impossible to find any holes in the story. Mr Whedon was the perfect person to have dealt with telling this story as he's a comic book fan, he nailed it 100%. I believe i'm going to see this film again tomorrow, it is just that awesome. Hulk will give you a fun time in this film, watch out!",10,9,18,27 April 2012
The Hunger Games," I expected more really!
","I wen't into his film expecting a bit more than what I got. The first 30 minutes of the film was very interesting, I was eager to see what these Hunger Games where gonna be about, sadly I was disappointed. I thought this is more of an adult film, all it was for me was a bunch of kids playing in the jungle. The story-line and the heart felt characters where a bit entertaining at the least, there's only one moment in the whole film that actually sparked emotion in me, other than that the rest was really average. It started off a a great idea but it all ended in sham. Too many plot holes as well an unmotivated dialog, the film as a whole sounds like a great idea but it wasn't. Nothing special here, it wouldn't be a loss if you only wait for the DVD of this.",5,1,2,29 April 2012
