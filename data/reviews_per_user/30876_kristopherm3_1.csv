Skyfall," Take all seriousness and gritty realism Casino Royale brought to the franchise and throw it out of the window, and you get Skyfall!
","What's good about this film:Great Directing, Great Cinematography, Great Cast, Great Theme.What's bad about this film:Terrible writing with forced-jokes that takes out every inch of seriousness and realism established in Casino Royale. What made the humour so good in Casino Royale was that is was unexpected and minor, but when it came it was fantastic. Skyfall's first 45 minutes is almost entirely comedy and when a serious point in the film occurs, the comedy takes away all emotion from the scene.Feels like recession Bond (most of the film takes place indoors with extremely limited exotic locations).The gritty tone of Casino Royale is lost entirely in this film and feels more like one of the Pierce Brosnan/Roger Moore Bond movies.Bond's 50th anniversary made this film overly nostalgic and re-introduces Q, which from my point of view, was a bad idea and makes the film sillier. The reason Bond was reeboted was because it was becoming very formulaic and a parody of itself, sadly being the 50th anniversary the writers felt the need to re-introduce this awful material to make the film a 'classic' Bond.Because of the 50th anniversary the Aston Martin DB5 is present, which seems like a good idea, right? Yes but it was executed VERY badly, the DB5 has been given the gadgets from Goldfinger like built in machine guns, this doesn't make ANY sense in the Daniel Craig films as Q doesn't supply cars with guns and it feels like a forced nod to the previous movies.",6,2,9,3 November 2012
