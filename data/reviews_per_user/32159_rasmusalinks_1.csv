The Avengers," Simple and predictable
","I chose to watch this movie because it got a great score here on IMDb, but (like many others said) that must obviously be fake (paying people to vote or just paying to raise the score directly?).I add a score on just 1 star to make the average more at level with what the movie deserves (around 5-6 stars). It does it's job of showing super heroes fight with lots of special effects, and nothing more. You don't develop any bond to any character. You know exactly what will happen and you know no hero will die. If they did die your reaction would just be: 'huh..', because you didn't develop feelings for them anyway.",1,7,30,15 June 2014
