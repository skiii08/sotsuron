The Devil's Advocate," The Devils Advocate A Good Thriller With Flaws
","The Devils Advocate is a good thriller with flaws from director Taylor Hackford whose admirable in making this movie about a hotshot lawyer who gets a lot more than he barged after when he learns that his new boss is Lucifer himself. Keanu Reeves is solid as Kevin Lomax the hotshot lawyer and Al Pacino is better than ever clearly enjoying his chance to play Satan. Reeves makes for an effective hero and Pacino is great as the villain. I just wish he had more to do. The rest of the cast including Charlize Theron, Jeffrey Jones, Connie Nielson, and Craig T Neslon are good as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The movie is creepy occasionally with some suspense and surprises but a slow pace is what weighed the film down the most. If director Taylor Hackford had amped up the suspense and made it faster paced somehow the movie would've been better. The few surprises near the end I didn't really see coming but it couldn't hide the movies few flaws. Overall though The Devil's Advocate is a decent thriller thats creepy with some suspense, surprises, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this overlong movie worth watching at least once.",7,3,5,20 June 2009
Angels & Demons," Angels And Demons A Decent Sequel With Some Flaws
","Angels and Demons is a decent sequel with some flaws which I'll get into later from director Ron Howard whose admirable in making this movie based on a popular book by Dan Brown. Tom Hanks returns as symbolist Robert Langdon who finds himself in another race against time to save four kidnapped Cardinals and somehow prevent a terrorist attack against the Vatican by a legendary secret brotherhood thought to have been extinct known as the Illuminati. Hanks is good as always in the role of Langdon who would give Nicolas Cage's Benjamin Gates from National Treasure a run for his money decoding ancient scriptures. The rest of the cast including Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard, and Armin Mueller-Stahl are good as the supporting characters. The film does have a fast pace but some flaws with character development, and a predictable twist near the end I sort of saw coming weighed it down a bit. I still thought the movie was decent though. The action is well executed but there are many moments when it's just go, go ,go, go, go, with not a whole lot of time in between to get to know the characters more. Overall with it obvious plot twist and other flaws aside Angels and Demons isn't that bad of a movie. It could've been better but if you're a fan of the Davinci Code than chances are you'll enjoy this one just as much. This film has action, drama, some suspense, and little humor with good performances by the cast especially Tom Hanks who makes this sequel worth watching at least once.",7,2,3,19 January 2010
The Incredible Hulk," The Incredilbe Hulk Does Justice To The Character
","The Incredible Hulk does justice to the popular comic book character giving audiences what they expect from one of these movies. Ang Lee's version of the Hulk wasn't that bad with some cool action sequences but it was long and a bit of a disappointment. This reboot gets it right and this is the one they should have done first. With a whole new cast and director The Hulk is back. It may not be as good as the Dark Knight or Iron Man but it's still an entertaining comic book brought to the big screen. Director Louis Leterrier does an excellent job at keeping the story moving at a steady pace with just the right amount of Hulk action throw in that fans of these type of films crave. This time around Edward Norton plays brilliant scientist Bruce Banner. Eric Bana played him in the film by Ang Lee who did a decent job with that role. But Norton inhabits the role of Banner and becomes that character. Norton's Banner is a cursed man desperately looking for a cure of the rage that lies within him waiting to be unleashed. With films like Primal Fear, Fight Club, and Pride and Glory, Edward Norton continues to establish as an extremely gifted actor. Liv Tyler steps into the role of Bruce's love Betty Ross taking over for Jennifer Connelly who did a good job with that role. Tyler's Betty is a beautiful smart scientist who loves Bruce and hates what her father has done to him. She proves to be another effective actress in the talented cast. Well done. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky a soldier with a thirst for power who will go through a similar experiment like Bruce that transforms him into a nightmarish beast known as the Abomination. Roth makes for an effective villain but his role in the movie unfortunately is cut short because for the last twenty minutes or so he lets his CGI counterpart take over. Other then that Roth is great at playing a villain with a lust for power. William Hurt takes over for Sam Elliot (who was good in the other one) as General Thunderbolt Ross who just happens to be Betty's father and Bruce's rival. Hurt doesn't really have much to do in the movie but he does an admirable job with the role. Hurt's Ross is a man obsessed to create a super soldier who's willing to bend the rules in order to protect his country and get what he wants. Tim Blake Nelson has a small role as Samuel Sterns. He brings some comic relief to the film and does a great job with his brief appearance in the movie. The special effects are much better than the first one, the Hulk and the Abomination looked realistic, even though you know it's CGI. All the action is intense and well choreographed I especially enjoyed the first chase sequence because it felt very real and not something made up in a computer. The battle royale at the end was cool but it did feel a bit anti-climatic and didn't last very long either like the one in Iron Man. There's always a surprise cameo at the end by another popular comic book character who had his own movie that came out the same year this one did for those of you who haven't seen it. I won't tell you who it is but for those of you who have seen it you know which cameo I'm talking about. Despite its few flaws the Incredible Hulk is much better than expected and is an improvement over the first attempt to bring this popular character to the big screen. With plenty of action, chases, explosions, drama, and thrills, if this sounds like a movie you'd enjoy than go see the Incredible Hulk. It's sure to please anyone looking for an above average comic book to watch.",8,2,3,30 May 2009
Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky Number Slevin An Impressive Action Crime Thriller
","Lucky Number Slevin is an impressive action crime thriller with some flaws but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Director Paul McGuigan is admirable in making this movie about a guy named Slevin who after a case of mistake identity finds himself caught in the middle of a war between two rival crime bosses known as The Rabbi and The Boss. Josh Hartnett is good as Slevin who may know more about his situation than he's letting on or maybe not. Hartnett proves to be effective in the role. Morgan Freeman is great as The Boss but he isn't given much to do. The same can go for Ben Kinsgley as The Rabbi but he like Freeman still make the best of their villain roles. The rest of the cast including Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, and Bruce Willis as a hit-man are solid as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The few action sequences are well executed and the intricate but not too complicated plot keeps your interest. Despite some flaws with character development, this movie was better than expected. Overall Lucky Number Sleven is a good action crime thriller with an interesting premise and exceptional performances by the cast who making it a movie worth the time to watch.",7,36,51,17 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Episode 1 An Okay Sci -Fi Film But Not Great
","Star Wars Episode 1 is an okay sci-film but from writer/director George Lucas who is admirable in making this movie but there are flaws that weigh it down. Episode 1 is a prequel to the other Star Wars trilogy which is set 30 years before the events of A New Hope where audiences get to meet a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi as a Jedi Knight and a gifted young boy named Anakin Skywalker who will eventually become the feared Dark Lord Of The Sith Darth Vader. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn (Obi-Wan's Master), Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi (played by Alec Guiness in the original), Natalie Portman as Queen Padme Amidala, and Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker. Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine (The Emperor) and Ray Park as one of the villains Darth Maul make the best of their brief appearances in the movie. Ray Park does lack screen time, development, and dialogue but he makes for a solid villain as the evil Darth Maul. McDiarmid does a decent enough job with his small part as the deceitful Senator Palapatine also known as Darth Sidious and later the Emperor. Samuel L. Jackson shows up in a cameo as Jedi Knight Mace Windu who does a good job in his small role. Yoda the one Luke meets in the previous films also makes a brief appearance. The action/fight sequences are well executed but the two sequels that followed had more of them. The only two to stand out sort of was the climatic showdown with Obi Wan and Quinn Gon against Darth Maul and the pod race at Tatooine with Anakin. The special effects were cool but you can tell it's CG. The pacing between the action was a little slow at times making it drag and the dialogue wasn't the best at times either. The one character to weigh this film down for me was Jar Jar Binks. I found him annoying and the movie could've done without his character. Despite its flaws though Star Wars Episode 1 is decent maybe not the greatest but it does reveal some unanswered questions from the previous films which was interesting. Episode 1 is a somewhat entertaining sci adventure with intense action, some humor, character development, and solid performances by most of the cast that make the film enjoyable.",6,1,4,9 June 2009
3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 To Yuma A Good Western Much Better Than Expected
","Let me first start of by saying I'm not a big fan of westerns but I was impressed with how much I enjoyed this one mostly due to the great performances by the talented cast including Russell Crowe (from Gladiator, Body of Lies, and A Beautiful Mind), Christian Bale (from American Psycho, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight), Ben Foster (from The Punisher, Hostage, and X-Men 3), and Peter Fonda (from Ulees Gold and Ghost Rider). Director James Mangold the man behind films like Identity and Walk The Line did an excellent job of bringing this movie to the big screen. It's one of those rare remakes that turns out to be a terrific western with plenty of action, character development, and spot on performances by the whole cast. Russell Crowe makes for an effective villain. His character Ben Wade is a man whose seen a lot of bad things in his life and those experiences are what made him the man he is an outlaw who's willing to kill to get what he wants. Crowe continues to establish himself in 3:10 To Yuma as one of Hollywoods most talented actors. Christian Bale is equally impressive as the hero Dan Evans a rancher who was injured in the Civil War. Bale's Evans is a man desperately looking for a way to support his family and sees his way of doing just that by joining some lawman to help escort Ben to the 3:!0 To Yuma in the city of Contention with Wade's gang hot on their trail. With films like The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and Terminator Salvation, Christian Bale continues to show why he's one of Hollywoods best actors today. Well done. Ben Foster plays Charles one of the criminals in Ben's gang another man whose probably seen his share of terrible things as well. Foster does a solid job of the role he does have in the movie. Peter Fonda does the best he can with the small role he does have in the film as Bryon McElroy a mysterious lawman with a violent past and the rest of the cast are good in their roles. There were however a few flaws like the pacing at times was slow and the ending which wasn't that bad but it could've been a little better. Overall 3:10 To Yuma has a good story, interesting characters, great performances from the cast, and plenty of action thats even spaced throughout the whole film that makes it an enjoyable western to watch.",8,1,2,1 June 2009
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident Evil AfterLife Is Okay But Not The Greatest
","Resident Evil Afrerlife is okay but not the greatest that has flaws which I'll get into later from writer/director Paul Anderson. It's the fourth film in the Resident Evil series.Milla Jovovich reprises her role as Alice the unstoppable killing machine heroine and she's perfect as the character who can still kick some serious ass while looking beautiful doing it. I just wish they had given her more to do -acting wise- than just killing countless undead zombies and various monsters (includine one with a giant axe) most likely created by the Umbrella Corporation. Ali Larter also returns as Claire Redfield from the third film who joins Alice once again in her quest to find survivors. Larter does what her role requires and she gets a decent action scene near the end.Wentworth Miller plays Claire's brother Chris who unfortunately doesn't really serve any real purpose except as a nod to die Resident Evil game fans. Miller's performance isn't that bad it's just his character isn't really developed or his relationship with Claire.Shawn Roberts seemed to be doing his best Agent Smith from the Matrix impression as the villain Albert Wesker unless thats how his character acts in the games. He gets two scenes the beginning and the end so for somebody who's supposed to be the main villain he's not in that much at all. His fight at the end between Claire and Chris felt anti-climatic. Not to mention it doesn't last very long either. A third act that had the same problem some other films (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Transformers 2 to name a few) did as well when the main bad guy is easily defeated within a few minutes.The rest of the cast including Kim Coates, Boris Kodjoe, and a brief cameo by Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine are okay but none of them are given any development, substance, or depth.The action sequences are okay but nothing we haven't seen before and there's no tension or suspense. The fact that there's no humor didn't help either. The zombies are all right despite not getting half as much screen time as they did in the previous three films. The monster with the huge Axe was decent despite just showing up with no explanation something a lot of the creatures do.And what was the purpose of taking away Alice's powers early on if it doesn't have any effect at all besides turning her human again? Because a minute later she somehow survives a plane crash in the mountains and apparently walks away without a scratch. This just didn't make a whole lot of sense like many other things. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief when it comes to movies but only to a point. The ending was predictable and a cameo by a certain character during the credits seemed a little pointless expect to set up for another sequel. At 97 minutes Resident Evil Afterlife wasn't that bad it just suffers from the sequel curse by cramming too much into one movie. The film seemed to be made purely for the action which may please some but I like to have a compelling story with well developed character, drama, emotion, suspense, and humor to go along with the spectacle.",5,2,5,2 January 2011
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. One Of The Best Sci-Fi Movies Ever Made
","E.T. is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made from acclaimed director Steven Spielberg who does a great job of making this movie about a group of children who try to help a stranded alien return home. The whole cast are exceptional in their roles including Dee Wallace, Peter Coyote, Drew Barrymore, and Henry Thomas as Elliot the boy who befriends the alien. The rest of the cast are good in their roles as well. The special effects are amazing too especially for that time. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this movie. The ending was fitting and will have some girls in tears. The music matched perfectly with what was happening on the screen and the tone of the film. Overall E.T. is a terrific sci-fi movie with a touching story, drama, humor, some action, and great performances by the cast that I highly recommend to any whose a fan of the genre. It has a little something in it for everyone. Go see it. You won't be disappointed.",10,1,3,16 June 2009
Training Day," Training Day A Solid Action Crime Thriller
","Training Day is a solid action crime thriller with exceptional performances by Ethan Hawke and especially Denzel Washington. Director Antoine Fuqua has done an admirable job of making this movie about a rookie cop who gets into a lot more than he bargained for while on a day with a senior rogue detective to prove he's got what it takes to be a narc. Denzel Washington is fantastic as twisted but charismatic Detective Alonzo Harris who takes a big departure from his good guy roles to play the villain in this one. Washington has show over and over again that he's a talented actor. Well he continues to prove just that in Traning Day and then some. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as rookie cop Jake Hoyt who finds himself in one increasingly dangerous situation after another. Hawke holds his own against Washington on screen and he may not have the flashier role but he goes a very good job as the hero in this film. The rest of the supporting cast including Scott Glenn, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and a brief appearance by Tom Berenger are solid in their roles but none of them are given much to do and are merely given extended cameos. They still prove to be effective none the less in their brief screen time. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The brutal action violence is well executed but the showdown between Washington and Hawke near the end did get a bit unrealistic. It was still intense though and the two actors really got to show their off their acting chops in this movie. The vulgar language did get a bit much at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. Despite some flaws Training Day is an entertaining action crime thriller with great performances from Hawke and especially Washington who make this movie definitely worth the time to watch.",8,46,53,13 June 2009
In Bruges," In Bruges Much Better Than Expected
","In Bruges was a better than expected action crime thriller comedy because of the great performances by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as two hit men held up in Bruges after a difficult job, and Raplh Fiennes in a brief role as their angry boss. Writer/Director Martin McDonagh does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen with just enough humor, action, and some suspense thats makes In Bruges an enjoyable film. The rest of supporting cast are good in their roles but it's Farrell, Gleeson, and Fiennes who stand out amongst them. In Bruges impressed me it was funny at times and violent with dark humor. Most of the screen time is given to the two leads (Farrell and Gleeson) who definitely make the best of it their scenes together are worth watching the film alone. Ralph Fiennes does lack screen time because he doesn't show up until late into the movie but he does a decent enough job with his smart part. I recommend anyone looking for a movie to watch thats different and entertaining at the same time most of that because of the terrific performances by Farrell and Gleeson. If you're a fan of action crime thrillers with humor or anyone in the cast than In Bruges is the movie for you.",8,2,5,8 June 2009
Kung Fu Panda," Kung Fu Panda A Better Than Expected Animated Movie
","Kung Fu Panda is a better than expected animated movie that has plenty of laughs with just the right amount of exciting martial arts action. Jack Black is perfect for the voice of Po an obese panda who wants to become a legendary kung fu master. The rest of the cast providing voices for their characters are solid including Dustin Hoffman(who gets the most screen time and dialogue of the supporting characters) as kung fu master Shifu, Angelina Jolie as Tigress, Lucy Liu as Viper, David Cross as Crane, Seth Rogen as Mantis, and Jackie Chan as Monkey. They prove some comic relief but some of them lack screen time and dialogue except for Hoffman's Shifu. Ian McShane provides the voice for Tai Lung and he does a decent enough job as the villain of the movie. The rest of the cast providing voices for the animated characters are good in their roles as well. Overall Kung Fu Panda is sure to please almost everyone out there looking for an entertaining movie with plenty of laughs, cool martial arts action, and a talented cast who help bring these animated characters to life.",8,1,2,8 June 2009
Star Trek," Star Trek An Entertaining Sci-Fi Action Adventure Remake
","Star Trek is an entertaining sci-fi action adventure remake. I thought there were some flaws which I'll get to later but the good more than outweighed the bad with this one. Director J. J. Abrahams has done an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen and he continues to show his talent as a filmmaker. Well done. Star Trek has it all character development, action, drama, suspense, humor, and a little romance. The cast including John Cho as Sulu, Bruce Greenwood as Pike, Karl Urban as Bones, Zoe Saladana as Uhura, Simon Pegg as Scotty, and Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime are very effective in their limited screen time. Winona Ryder shows up for a cameo role as Spocks mother and she's good in her brief part. The two stands outs were Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock. They both were impressive as their characters who the story seemed to focus on the most. The two characters I found to to be a little weak in the cast were Anton Yelchin as Chekov mainly because his Russain accent was a bit strong at times and Eric Bana as the villain Nero a Romulan Captain with a major grudge who doesn't have much to do except look mad. They both are talented actors and weren't in it all that much anyways so neither of them really hurt the film. But I just thought their performances weren't as good as others. No offense. The action sequences are well paced with a compelling story and amazing special effects that help bring the film to life. I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this movie but I enjoyed up liking it. Star Trek was much better than G.I. Joe or Wolverine which weren't the greatest films at least to me. I felt entertained after watching this movie so it's definitely worth seeing. Overall despite some flaws if you're looking for an entertaining sci-fi adventure with character development, action, suspense, drama, and humor. Then look no further Star Trek is the movie for you. It won't disappoint.",8,3,10,12 January 2010
Memento," Memento Much Better Than Anticipated
","Memento was a much better film than anticipated from acclaimed writer/director Christopher Nolan the man behind films like The Prestige, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and last years blockbuster hit The Dark Knight which was my favorite movie of 2008. In Memento Nolan really establishes himself as an extremely talented filmmaker. Memento has an intricate but not too complicated story and the way the movie plays out with the ending in the beginning and the beginning at the end makes it feel different (in a good way) and original. Its one of those films to watch a couple times to fully understand what it was all about and so that you can pick up on little things you didn't notice the first time around. The surprises in store for anyone who hasn't seen it I wasn't quite expecting myself which made the film very enjoyable to watch at least to me. The three leads in the movie are admirable in their roles including Guy Pearce as Leonard a man with a rare brain disorder after an accident who can't form new memories. Pearce's Leonard is after the one who raped and killed his wife a man's identity he can never know for sure. Pearce is believable in the role and does a great job as the main character. Carrie Anne-Moss does a decent job as Natalie an ally to Leonard who helps in his quest to find his wife's killer but may not be who she appears. Moss is quite good at playing a character you're not sure is trying to help Leonard or just using him. The same can go for Joe Pantoliano whose equally impressive as Teddy a man Leonard isn't sure whether he can fully trust. The rest of the relatively unknown cast also turn in solid performances. The ending is fitting which reveals some secrets while keeping other questions unanswered but that doesn't hurt the movie. Overall Memento was much better than expected because of it's interesting revenge story, complex characters played by talented actors, and surprising plot twists that make for an above average entertaining thriller to watch.",8,3,5,8 June 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Inglorious Basterds A Decent Movie With Flaws
","Inglorious Basterds is a decent movie with flaws which I'll get into later. Writer/director Quentin Tarantino is admirable job in making this film but I don't consider it a classic. Brad Pitt is very good as Aldo 'The Apache' Raine. I thought he'd be in it a lot more than he was considering he's the lead but Pitt is still effective in the role. The same can go for the rest of the cast including Melanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassenbender, and Michael Myers in a brief extended appearance. The brutal violence is well executed and there were some funny moments. The biggest flaw I thought this film had was a lack of character development because besides Pitt, Laurent, and Waltz no one else is in it for all that much. Some make cameos while others show up for a few extended appearances. For the most part however all the actors are believable as their characters. I actually preferred Kill Bill Volume 2, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs over this one but it isn't that bad. I just thought it could've been better. The pacing was slow in some areas which made the 153 minutes drag from time to time. If you're a big fan of Tarantino's you may enjoy it more than I did. The solid performances by Pitt, Laurent, and Waltz still make this movie worth watching though at least once.",7,1,4,16 January 2010
Underworld," Underworld A Decent Gothic Sci-Fi Action Adventure
","Underworld is a decent Gothic sci-fi action adventure from director Len Wiseman who does a good job in making this movie but there are some flaws that weigh it down. I'll get back to that later. Kate Beckinsale turns in a solid performance as the lead Selene a vampire Death Dealer in the middle of a war between her race and werewolves known as Lycans. She looks great in leather and is convincing as the character especially in the action/fight sequences. Scott Speedman is decent as Michael Corvin who eventually becomes a powerful vampire/werewolf hybrid because something to do with his blood. He gets a few fight sequences near the end that are impressive but for the most of the movie he's either being chased, running, or being held prisoner. Speedman however like Beckinsale is good as his character. Michael Sheen is terrific as Lucian the Lycan leader whose supposed to have been dead and is after Michael for unknown reasons until those motives are revealed later on in the film. Sheen's role may get cut short near the end but he does a great job of portraying someone who you're not sure is either the villain or a man simply driven by revenge who is willing to do whatever is necessary to defend his race. Well done. Bill Nighy is equally impressive as one of the vampire Lord's Viktor but he isn't given a lot of screen time and his showdown between both Michael and Selene near the end felt a bit rushed. He's also easily defeated but Nighy is effective in the role none the less. The rest of the cast including Shane Brolly, Sophia Myles, and a brief appearance by Wentworth Miller are okay in their roles but don't have much to do. The action/fight sequences are well executed but a slow pace in between made the movie fee a little long. The film seemed to be juggling a bit too many characters and it sort of lacked a central villain because there are quite a few of them in this one. If they had focused on just one instead of Nighy, Brolly, Sheen, and many more the movie would've been a little better. It did have a Gothic feel which seemed to fit with the tone of the film and made it a little different than some sci-fi action movies out there. The music seemed to match well with what was happening on the screen as well. So despite some flaws Underworld may not be the greatest movie ever made but it's certainly not the worst either. Overall Underworld has an intricate story, intense action, some suspense, cool special effects, and good performances by the cast who make this sci-fi movie worth watching at least once.",7,2,3,22 June 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Dawn Of The Dead A Decent Horror Remake
","Dawn Of The Dead Is A Decent Horror Remake from director Zack Snyder whose admirable in making this movie about a group of people who hold find themselves trapped in a shopping mall with aggressive flesh eating zombies outside waiting for them to make a mistake. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mehki Phifer. The rest of the supporting cast are okay in their limited screen time. This remake felt more like an action film than horror because it didn't really scare me but that didn't hurt the movie. The action sequences most involving the character being killed in gruesome ways by the zombies or vise-versa are well executed. The zombies did look terrifying and were fast too but you could help but get this feeling you've seen before. The effect worked none the less though. There was a little suspense but the ending was a bit predictable. Despite some flaws Dawn Of The Dead really isn't that bad of a movie because it's sure to please any die hard fan of the genre. Overall Dawn Of The Dead has just enough gruesome deaths, chases, some suspense, a little humor, and decent performances by the cast who make this one of the better remakes out there.",7,1,1,30 June 2009
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2 A Bit Disappointing But Decent
","Iron Man 2 is a bit disappointing yet decent comic book sequel. Don't get me wrong it's okay but there's was too much talking and not enough action. I enjoyed Inception this summer a lot more than this one. Robert Downey is solid as Tony Stark but even he can't save this from being a bit of a disappointment compared to the first one. He's everything Tony Stark should be and is still a perfect choice for the character none the less. Gwyneth Paltrow does what she can as Pepper Popps despite not having a whole lot to do. Don Cheadle is all right as Jim Rhodes and War Machine who's involved in the action more than the previous one. Scarlet Johannson is decent as Natalie Rushman/The Black Widow who like Paltrow doesn't have much to do except for a third act action sequence which is okay while it lasts. Sam Rockwell is a good actor (Moon, and Machstick Men) but I actually found him to be rather annoying as Justin Hammer one of the villains if you want to call the role that. I think it was more the character than him who I thought is annoying. He wasn't menacing or threatening to Tony at all. Rockwell did however a bring some comic relief to the movie. Mickey Rourke's underused as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash who is intimidating even with very little dialog and screen time. They could've done a lot more with his character who after an impressive display of destruction at the race track he takes a back seat for a large part of the movie particularly the second half. He shows up briefly near the end only to be dispatched as quickly as he appears. Whiplash didn't turn to be as much of a threat to Tony as he could've been. Samuel L Jackson does his usual thing as Nick Fury in a small role considering he has only two scenes with Downey Jr. He's in it for five minutes tops to set up the upcoming Avengers movie and Kate Mara is wasted in an early cameo appearance. The story itself was kind of predictable, and the few action sequences were so-so but they missing that wow factor. Most of the action happens in the third act which turns out to be a bit of a letdown because it's over too fast. The only one that had any real intensity to it was at the race track when Rourke's Whiplash confronts Tony for the first time. There's a lot of talking in the second half and almost no action except for a fight between a drunk Tony and Rhodes in Iron Man suits which weighed it down a bit. Not that there has to be constant explosions, fist fights, and violence every 10 minutes but some more spectacle would've made it better. And for a movie called Iron Man I was surprised about how little we actually see Stark in the suit. This movie suffered the same problem that Spider-man 3 had of trying to put too much into one film with mixed results. Actor/Director Jon Favreau is admirable in making this sequel despite it's flaws that further develops Downey's Tony Stark which isn't necessarily a bad thing but certain key characters (Potts, Rhodes, Black Widow, and Whisplash) unfortunately aren't given much development and lack screen time. The fight at the end with Downey's Iron Man and Cheadler's War Machine facing off against Rourke's Wiplash is over in like 30 seconds was a big disappointment because it felt rushed. What was the point of him showing up after the drones were killed if he's just going to get killed off thirty seconds later. There wasn't any danger or suspense to speak of and dispatching the main villain in such a short battle at the end seemed like a wasted opportunity to show how dangerous he could be. Overall this movie really isn't that bad. Iron Man 2 has some action, drama, a little humor, and solid performances by the cast (Robert Downey Jr) for the most part it just could've been better. The part with a drunk Tony in an Iron Man suit wasn't all that funny either. I prefer The Dark Knight over this sequel as far as comic book movies go because it delivered everything you could want or expect from one of those films. Iron Man 2 on the other hand wasn't as good as the original which is shame because I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't help feeling a little disappointed after watching it.",6,1,2,29 September 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pirates 2 A Flawed Adventure Movie
","Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest is not that great of a movie. Don't get me wrong the whole cast are terrific in their roles including Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, and Kiera Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. This film isn't all that bad but it couldn't been a lot better. The acting is great, the special effects are amazing, and the action is impressive but somewhat of a let down. Gore Verbinski does do an admirable job as a director but the movie is overlong and it feels like there's just too much going on a similar problem that Spider-man 3 suffered as well. Despite it flaws Johnny Depp makes the movie worth seeing because of his fantastic performance as the charismatic Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom is good as Will Turner and Kiera Knightley is equally impressive as Elizabeth Swann. The rest of the cast also turn in solid performances including Stellan Skarsgard as Boot Strap Bill (Will's father), and Bill Nighy as Davy Jones the legendary Captain of the Flying Ducthman. Nighy's unrecognizable under all the CGI effects that helped create his character. Nighy makes for an imposing villain but lacks screen time. The ending definitely leaves off with a cliffhanger and there is a surprise cameo by a returning character from the first film but by then you just want the movie to be over. At least in my opinion Dead Man's Chest is a decent movie but nothing spectacular that left me feeling disappointed.",4,2,3,11 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pirates A Terrific Adventure Film
","Pirates Of The Caribbean Curse Of The Black Pearl is a terrific adventure film with action, drama, suspense, some romance, and humor. Johnny Depp is amazing as Captain Jack Sparrow and he's clearly having a lot of fun with this character. The rest of the supporting cast are great in their roles including Geoffrey Rush as the villain Captain Barbossa, Orland Bloom as Will Turner a blacksmith, and Kiera Knightely as Elizabeth Swann. Gore Verbinksi does a fantastic job of bringing this movie to the big screen. From the action, to the drama, to the humor and adventure this film has something in it for everyone who's looking for an entertaining movie to watch. It really is that good and The Curse Of The Black Pearl is now one of the my favorite movies. With two possible sequels on the way lets just hope they can be just as good or even better than this one. Go see it you won't be disappointed even with a running time of 2 hours and 23 minutes the movie is fast paced and action packed. With plenty of humor thrown in that balances well between the drama, suspense, and action.",10,2,5,11 May 2009
Public Enemies," Public Enemies A Decent Action Crime Drama
","Public Enemies is a decent action crime drama with exceptional performances by it's two leads. Writer/Director Michael Mann is admirable in bring this movie of notorious bank robber John Dillinger but some flaws with character development and the pacing weighed it down. I thought the good outweighed the bad though with this one. Johnny Depp is great as always playing the charismatic Dillinger who became public enemy number one in the 1930'S Chicago. Christian Bale is equally impressive as determined FBI Agent Melvin Purvis the man whose assigned to track Dillinger down. Depp and Bale only have a few scenes with each other but they both are very believable as their characters. Well done. Marion Collitard as Dillingers love Billie Frechette, Billy Crudup as J. Edgar Hover, Stephen Lang as Charles Winstead, and Giovanni Ribisi as Alvin Karpis are also good in their limited screen time but lack development. Their characters and others including Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd who makes a brief cameo aren't really developed which weighed the movie down a bit because most of the focus is on Depp and Bale. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing but you don't really get to know many of the characters that well except for them. The pacing of the film was a little slow at times with a running time of 140 minutes but overall I thought it was a decent. If you like gangster movies than chances are you'll enjoy this one. Public Enemies has action and drama with solid performances by Johnny Depp and Christian Bale who make this film worth watching at least once.",7,2,4,16 January 2010
Spider-Man 2," Spider-man 2 A Much Better Than Expected Sequel
","Spider-man 2 was a much better than expected sequel. It's better than the original with more improved special effects, humor, a nasty villain, and more intense action. Director Sam Raimi did a great job of making this sequel which is the best of the three films. Spider-man 3 unfortunately was the worst of the trilogy. This one however is definitely worth seeing because it's that good. Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Peter Parker/Spider-man and he continues to be a good choice for the character. Peter's now in college and what he wants more than anything is a normal life but his character feels a duty to protect people with his amazing arachnid abilities. Kristen Dunst returns as Mary Jane and she's okay in the part but like the previous one she isn't good much to do except eventually being the lady in distress again later on in the film. James Franco is back again as Harry Osbourn who blames Spider-man for his father's death. Franco does a decent job as Harry but like Dunst he isn't given much to do and his character lacks screen time. Alred Molina joins the cast as brilliant scientist Otto Octavious who after a freak accident becomes Doc Ock because of four mechanic arms melded to his back. Molina like Dafoe makes for a menacing villain and is well developed. Also his character fortunately doesn't have a corny costume like the Green Golbin did in the original. No offense. Rosemary Harris also reprises her supporting role as Peter's Aunt May. She isn't really given much to do either but Rosemary Harris makes the best of her limited screen time and Bruce Campbell shows up once again in a cameo appearance as a theater usher. The special effects are an improvement over the first one and so are the action/ fight sequences most of them between Spider-man and his nemesis Doc Ock. The one standing out is of course their fight that starts off on a skyscraper near a giant clock and then on top of a speeding train thats grows more intense as their confrontation escalates toward it's conclusion. The final showdown between Spider-man and Doc Ock near the end was a bit of a letdown compared to train one but everything else that happened before in the movie made up for the somewhat rushed conclusion. The pacing in between the action was a little slow at times and the dialogue wasn't the best occasionally problems that the original had too but this sequel is still a very good movie. It was much better than expected and I was fairly impressed with the film overall. Spider-man 2 is one of the best sequels (besides The Dark Knight, and T2 Judgement Day) out there with just the right amount of well balanced intense action, character development, humor, drama, some suspense, and impressive performances by the cast especially Molina that's sure to please almost any comic book fan.",9,6,8,9 June 2009
Batman Returns," Batman Returns A Decent Sequel But With Flaws
","Batman Returns is a decent sequel but with some of the same flaws that were in the first one by Tim Burton. I re-watched the original and this one after seeing writer/director Christopher Nolan's take on the popular comic book character with Batman Begins and the Dark Knight which are so much better than Burton's no offense. Director Tim Burton does an okay job making this sequel but some problems weigh it down which I'll get into later. Michael Keaton reprises the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman whose decent as the character but he isn't as good as Christian Bale in my opinion. He wasn't able to bring the presence Bale brought to the character. Keaton however does what he can with what very little he was given. Danny Devito had a little more to work with as The Penguin and he's okay despite shouting a lot of his lines. DeVito is a good actor but this isn't his best performance. It maybe because I just don't find the Penguin that interesting of a villain but DeVito still turns in a solid performance none the less as the short grotesque and deformed enemy of the Dark Knight. Michelle Pffiefer fared much better as Selina Kyle/Catwoman turning in a solid performance as the dangerous femme fatale. Burton probably should have chosen just one of them to be the villain for this film because their story arcs felt rushed at times because Pfieffer does an impressive job with her role. Well done. Christopher Walken does his best as Max Shreck a psychotic businessman who helps The Penguin run for mayor. Walken sort disappears for much of the second half only to reappear for the third act but he's okay in the role. The rest of the cast are so-so but none of them are memorable. Michael Gough as Alfred and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon have what amounts to a few extended appearances which is disappointing because their characters could've been handled much better. They both do what their roles require I guess though. The action sequences are well executed but none of them are exciting or intense as the ones in Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. The dialog was once again cheesy at times and many characters like Harvey Dent for one aren't even in it or mentioned making their appearances in the first one seem totally pointless. Like Burton's first Batman one of the biggest problems is that this sequel seemed to focus mainly on the Penguin and Catwoman instead of the title character himself especially in the first hour. Keaton doesn't even show up until over 12 minutes into the film. He makes a brief extended appearance with very little dialog for an action sequence and then his character disappears until almost 40 minutes into the movie since most of the beginning centers on The Penguin and Selina Kyle's Catwoman. For a while it seemed Keaton has a cameo in his own movie which didn't help in the long run. After that initial first 40 minutes luckily he's in it more but Keaton seemed to get cheated out of some more much needed development and screen time again. I didn't realize just how little these films actually focused on the Dark Knight until I decided to recently re-watch them. It's always not a good idea to focus more on the villains than the main character because he's the one the audience is going to care about. I thought this problem was solved with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight because at least those films focused much more on Bruce Wayne/Batman especially Begins. The Dark Knight felt like an ensemble piece and by the end I think Bale got just as much screen time as the late Heath Ledger, Aaron Echkhart, and Gary Oldman. That film focused on the four of them evenly giving all four actors plenty of moments to develop their characters and shine. Overall Batman Returns isn't that bad of a sequel it just could have been better. I recommend Batman Begins and The Dark Knight to any fan of the comic book character because both films are entertaining fast paced action crime dramas and worth the time to watch. Batman Returns had potential to be a good sequel only it ended up being somewhat of a letdown compared to Nolan's two superior films on the Cape Crusader. Yeah it has some cool action, a little dark humor, and solid performances by the cast (Keaton, Devito, and especially Pfeiffer) but I just wish the film itself was a lot better than it turned out to be. I'd chose Nolan's two Batman movies any day over this one.",6,1,3,27 March 2010
Blade," Blade A Decent Vampire Movie
","Balde is a decent vampire movie from director Stephen Norrington who does a good job in making this but the lack of suspense, the dialogue at times, and a rushed finale are what weigh it down. The film does however offer just enough cool mart arts action, impressive special effects, and solid performances by the cast. Wesley Snipes is admirable in the title role of Blade a half-human half-vampire who becomes humanity's protector from the sinister forces that threaten their world. Snipes is believable in the role especially in the action/fight sequences. Stephen Dorff is effective as the villain Deacon Frost but he isn't given much to except for a few action sequences and his showdown with Blade at the end is sort of a let down. Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, and Donal Logue are good as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Udo Kier and Traci Lords show up for brief appearances but neither of them ever get the chance to leave an impression. The action/fight sequences are well executed featuring fierce bone crushing moves but the final fight between Blade and Frost was a bit disappointing compared to the ones that came before it. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either and the lack of suspense weighed down a bit but everything else made up for it's flaws. Despite it's problems Blade is a decent adaption of a comic book with enough impressive martial arts action, cool special effects, and solid performances by most of the cast who make it worth watching if only the film had been a little better I would've enjoyed it more than I did.",6,2,4,15 June 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Wolverine Is A Decent Movie With Flaws
","X-Men Origins Wolverine is a decent comic book movie brought to the big screen its no Dark Knight or Iron Man but it's certainly no Elektra or most recently Punisher War Zone. The film follows the story of James Howlett and his transformation into Logan also known as Wolverine. The movie answers a lot of questions about his character and is an entertaining action adventure with some flaws. But fortunately the good outweighs the bad. The director Gavin Hood does a good job of keeping Logans character at the center and well choreographed action sequences at a steady pace. As far as the acting goes everyone pretty much did a solid job of bringing these characters to life. Hugh Jackman was born to play Logan/Wolverine and he does a great job with the character. He's a man who's sick of fighting and just wants a normal life. Jackman's Wolverine is a man conflicted with feelings of anger, rage, guilt, regret, and revenge. Equally impressive is Liev Shreiber as Wolverines half brother Victor Creed/Sabretooth. He brings a lot to the role of a man who feels betrayed and abandoned by his brother. Creed is a mirror image of what Logan could be if he fully embraced his dark side. Tyler Mane who played the character in the first X-Men film by Bryan Singer did a good job with that role. But his character felt more like a henchmen and he didn't have much dialogue. He wasn't in it that much either because the focus seemed more on Mangeto and Mystique than him. Besides two fights with Wolverine his character was a bit disappointing in the first one. Shreiber makes for a menacing Sabretooth just like Mane but fortunately in this one he gets a lot more screen time and is much more developed. Danny Huston also does a solid job as Striker taking over for Brian Cox. He's man who always has a secret agenda and can never be fully trusted. Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox is strikingly beautiful yet mysterious woman with a secret of her own. Out of all the supporting characters the only one to leave an impression was Gambit. In his first big screen appearance Taylor Kistch a relatively unknown does a good job as the Cajun thief Remy Lebleau also known as Gambit. He doesn't get a whole lot of screen time but he does leave an impression and his brawl with Wolverine is a very impressive fight sequence. Gambit gets about 10 to 15 minutes of screen time but his appearance isn't as nearly as disappointing as Venom's was in Spider-man 3. Maybe he might get his own origin story one day. Mostly everything works from the pace to the action that become more frenetic as the movie goes on. There were however a few things I was disappointed one thing was Ryan Reynolds character Wade Wilson/Deadpool. He gets at the most 5 to 8 minutes of screen time no lie. He shows up early on and then his character disappears until the final third act. With news of a possible spin off of his character in the works maybe it can do justice to his character because this one doesn't unfortunately because Reynolds is great in the small role he does have in the movie. The same can go for Dominic Monaghans character Chris Bradley/Bolt who can control electricity. His role in the movie seems sort of pointless and is nothing more than a brief extended cameo. The rest of the supporting cast do an admirable job in their roles including Will.i.am in his acting debut as teleporter John Wraith, Danny Henney as expert marksman Agent Zero, and Kevin Durand as Fred Dukes/The Blob, but unfortunately none of them aren't as fully developed as Wolverine and Sabretooth. The movie at least to me also felt a bit rushed even with a running time of 107 minutes. If the film had been longer and focused a little more on Deadpool or Gambit to name a few giving their characters more screen time instead of giving them brief cameos the movie would've been a better. Besides it's flaws X-Men Origins is still an entertaining comic book film plenty of action, fist fights, explosions, chases, and some humor that make for an enjoyable film to watch.",6,2,6,8 May 2009
Constantine," Constantine A Decent Comic Book Movie
","Constantine is a decent movie based on the DC/Vertigo comic book Hellblazer from director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend). The movie tells the story of John Constantine a supernatural detective gifted with the curse to see half angels and half demons living amongst us disguised as humans who is mankind's only hope for survival against the sinister forces that threaten their world. Keanu Reeves is solid as the title character portraying a man whose trying to buy his way into heaven for a past mistake by ridding the earth of demons because he doesn't want to damned to hell for eternity. Reeves may not get any nominations for his performance but he does a good job with the role of Constantine. Rachel Weisz is equally impressive as detective Angela Dodson who's investigating the mysterious death of her twin sister and joins forces with Constantine to find out the truth. Weisz continues to show her talent in this movie. Well done. The rest of the cast including Shia Labeouf, Dijimon Honsou, Pruitt Taylor Vincent and Max Baker are admirable in their roles but none of them get much to do and lack screen time. The same can go for Tilda Swinton, Gavin Rossdale, and Peter Storemare in a brief cameo role as Satan himself who are decent in their roles but they like some other characters get the short end of the stick. The pacing of the movie did seem a little slow at times too but other then that Constantine is an above average comic book movie brought to the big screen. Its no Dark Knight or Iron Man but it's certainly not like Spider-man 3 or Punisher War Zone. The special effects are state of the art and the few scenes where hell on Earth is shown are magnificently done. It's a nightmarish landscape overrun by demonic creatures from the darkest pits of hell. The music seemed to match well with what was going on the screen and the tone of the film. This film may be a bit light on action but what it does have is some character development, suspense, a few surprises, solid acting, an interesting story, and cool special effects that make for a good movie to watch. It may not be a classic or a masterpiece but the movie is better than some other ones that failed to entertain.",7,2,3,6 June 2009
Orphan," Orphan An Effective Thriller With Some Flaws
","Orphan is an effective thriller with some flaws from director Jaume Collet-Serra whose admirable in making this film about a couple who recently lost their baby adopt Esther an innocent 9 year old girl harboring a dangerous secret. Vera Farminga and Peter Sarsgaard are good as the married couple. Farminga shows all the emotions as Kate Coleman still traumatized over the death of her newborn baby who starts to investigate into Esther's past when strange things start to happen. Sarsgaard is decent as her husband John but I found him to be a bit too gullible when he's falling for Esther's manipulations taking her side over his wife's. Sarsgaard still turns in a good performance though despite not being given much to do. Isabelle Fuhrman is frighteningly effective as Esther the seemingly angelic child who will do anything to get what she wants even manipulate the people around her and murder. Fuhrman keeps you on edge as the villain wondering what she is willing to do next to protect her secret. Well done. The rest of the cast are okay but none of them stand out besides Fuhrman. The film did a nice job of developing most of the characters and the violence committed by Esther was well executed. I thought the pacing was a little slow and there some predictable moments. But other then that Orphan is still a decent thriller which I'm sure will please almost any die hard fan of the genre. The twist near the end I didn't really see coming and it helped to explain why Esther would go to the extremes in order to protect her secret from getting out. Overall this film could've been better but it certainly wasn't the worst I've seen. Orphan has character development, drama, and some suspense which always helps elevate the movie. Plus the exceptional performances by Vera Farminga and especially Isabelle Fuhrman make it worth watching at least once.",7,5,9,17 January 2010
Terminator Salvation," Terminator Salvation Is An Entertaining Sci-fi Action Adventure
","Let me first start off by saying that after reading some very harsh reviews for Terminator Salvation I went in thinking it was going to be one of the worst movies ever but to my surprise the movie definitely wasn't as bad as many critics say it is. I found it to be a worthy entry into the Terminator series. It may not be as good as Judgment Day but it's much better than the first one (which was good but with some flaws) and Rise Of The Machines. The third film by Jonathan Mostow was okay but I couldn't buy that Skynet would send back a woman terminator to once again attempt to kill John Connor. No offense to Kristana Loken who played the villain in the third film. She did a good job with what she was given and everyone else in it did a decent job but the movie become kind of corny. It was basically the same plot of the first one a terminator from the future is sent back to the past to either kill Sarah Connor or her son and a guardian is sent to protect them. Terminator Salvation is set after Judgement Day where man is at war with the powerful machines of Skynet that has taken over Earth. The desolate wasteland in the movie looked very real and everyone involved did a great job of bringing this apocalyptic world to life. I don't get all the negative reviews for this movie. The people in the theater I went to also seemed to enjoy it. Some have complained about Christian Bale's performance and that he's not in that much. I for one thought Bale turns in a solid performance as John Connor who's climbing the ranks to become the leader of the resistance. Bale brings an intensity and vulnerability to the character. Connor isn't that punk kid played by Edward Furlong in T2 who did do a good job with that character, or the off the grid bum like Nick Stahl's in T3 who did a decent job with that role as well. Bale's Connor is a grown man who knows he's fated for something great but has doubts whether they can win this war against the machines. As for Bale using his Batman voice as Connor. It didn't really sound like the voice he uses for that character at least not to me. Maybe a little similar at times but he didn't talk like that throughout the whole film. I also read complaints about his character yelling a lot. Well if you were put into the situation these people were in the movie I think just about anyone would be yelling. With movies like The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and American Psycho, Christian Bale continues to show why he's one of Hollywoods best actors today. I thought he got just as much screen time as his co-star newcomer Sam Worthington. Yeah for a little while the movie did seem to center a little more on Worthington since Bale does sit out action wise for a while except the beginning and towards the climax but in the end I'd say their screen time was about even. Sam Worthington does a good job playing the mysterious character Marcus Wright. Marcus is on death row for an unknown crime when we first meet him in the year 2003 and he signs his body over to Cyberdine for experimental research. Wright does an excellent job portraying Marcus as a man looking for a second chance at redemption who isn't exactly who he seems to be. There are some secrets about Marcus that are revealed later on in the film which were surprising. If you've seen the trailer for the movie then you already know Marcus isn't who he appears and that his character is either there to help John Connor or kill him. Equally impressive was Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese who will one day become John's father when he is sent back in time by Connor to protect his mother and fall in love with her so that he will be born. Yelchin did a terrific job of making you believe this was a young version of the character in the first one played by Michael Biehn who also did a great with the role. Well done. The rest of the cast did a good job in their supporting roles including Moon Bloodgood, Bryce Dallas Howard, Common, Michael Ironside, and Helena Bonham Carter in a very brief role. There's also a brief blink and missed it cameo by someone from the previous films thanks to the work of some great CGI. Terminator Salvation does have intense action sequences that are well paced but it's also a story about John Connor's rise to leadership and Marcus Wright's quest for redemption two very different men who must put aside their differences and join in a common goal to save teenager Kyle Reese from Skynet before the machines take over for good. Director McG did an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen from the rousing action and battle sequences to the realistic apocalyptic wasteland that the world has turned into because of the machines that are relentless in their efforts to exterminate the human race. Overall Terminator Salvation is an entertaining sci-fi action adventure with some flaws with character development and minor plot holes but I still thought it was decent much better than Rise of the Machines. It's sure to entertain anyone who enjoys non-stop action, fist fights, explosions, chases, some character development (Bale and Worthington), drama, suspense, and thrills with incredible special effects that marvels those that can be found in Michael Bay's Tranformers. If you're a fan of Judgment Day than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. Go see it. Don't believe all the negative reviews by critics. Much better than expected despite it's few problems.",8,4,6,29 May 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," The Day After Tomorrow Okay But Flawed
","The Day After Tomorrow is okay but flawed from director Roland Emmerich whose admirable in making this movie about a climatologist who must go to New York to save his son because global warming has caused a large part of the world to be taken over by a new age. The cast are good in their roles including Dennise Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ian Holm, Emmy Rossum, and Sela Ward but even their talent can hide the flaws that can be found in this film. No offense to Dennis Quaid because he is a good actor and he is the main character in this movie sort of but at least to me I felt his character played second fiddle to the special effects and most of the action sequences. Except for one action sequence early on and then a few near the end Quaid's character sort of takes a back seat in this one and lets the special effects take over for large parts of the movie. Most of the people in the cast kind of do but some of them including Gyllenhaal are in a few action sequences. I thought Gyllenhall had more to do than Quaid who for most of the film is warning ignorant people about the possibility of a new ice age that will change their world forever. The rest of the cast are okay but like Quaid they don't have much to do. The special effects are the big highlight in the movie because they're incredible even though you can tell it's CG but it works none the less. The action sequences are intense but there could have be more of them. The pacing was slow at times and the dialogue wasn't the greatest occasionally either. The only reason why I gave this film five stars is because of the attempt by the actors and the special effects. If it wasn't for those two things I definitely wouldn't have liked this movie. Overall The Day After Tomorrow is a decent sci-fi apocalyptic action drama with an interesting premise, great special effects, some intense action, and good performances by the cast but this movie could have been a lot better.",5,1,2,20 June 2009
Spider-Man 3," Spider-man 3 A Major Let Down
","With the success of Spider-man 1 and 2. I had high hopes for Spider-man 3 which in my opinion was the worst of the trilogy. It was somewhat entertaining but the movie ended up being a big disappointment. I'll start off with the good before going into what I think went wrong with Spider-man 3. It starts off great with a blistering Ariel fight/chase sequence between Peter and Harry who has taken his father's Goblin persona. I thought the whole cast did an admirable job in their roles Tobey Maguire is good as Peter Parker and Spider-man. Kristen Dunst is okay as Mary Jane although she's not given much to do except look angry and whine, James Franco is solid as both a hero and a super villain who's finally given something to do. Thomas Haden Church gives an equally impressive performance as Flint Marko but unfortunately he's not in it all that much considering his CGI counterpart takes over for large parts of his scenes. Church doesn't have much dialogue either. Topher Grace does his usual thing as Eddie Brock but he makes for a terrible Venom no offense. I just couldn't buy him being a sinister super villain. Thomas Haden Curch actually would've been better in that role or maybe Vin Disiel. Bryce Dallas Howard does her best as Gwen Stacy in a role that seems to be entirely wasted and the rest of the cast turn in good performances including J. K Simmons who continues to steal every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson. Spider-man 3 had everything going for it then about an hour into it things go from bad to worse and it goes downhill from there. Now to the bad it feels like Sam Raimi who is a fantastic filmmaker tried to put too much into one movie. Peter Parker's turn to the dark side because of the symboite had potential and did bring much comic relief to the film but it wasn't as interesting as it should have been and the humor started to get a little silly after a while. Also the introduction of three villains was a bit much (The New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom not to mention the enemy within himself). With the exception of Harry's Goblin who was well developed, Sandman and Venom lacked development and screen time. Which brings me to the biggest disappointment about Spider-man 3 is Venom. Director Sam Raimi had stated he disliked the character but was coerced to include him in the film. Well his disinterest in the character shows. I'll admit I'm not the biggest Venom fan but I do know he's one of Spider-man's most iconic and dangerous villains. I was pretty excited when I found out he was going to be in this film but I ended up being very disappointed considering he gets at the most 8 to 10 minutes of screen time. He doesn't show up until extremely late into the movie and only gets one fight with Spider-man at the end that lasts probably about a total of fifteen seconds since Venom disappears for much of the final battle at the end. He's easily defeated and wasn't that much of a threat like he was in the comics. If the film had cut out Sandman leaving Harry and Venom as the main villains the movie to me would've been a lot better considering except for Harry, Sandman and Venom are just poorly developed. Overall Spider-man 3 is a decent film with some okay action sequences but they never last long except for the first fight between Harry and Peter and then the anti-climatic battle at the end. But the movie failed to live up to my expectations and was a major disappointment. Maybe Spider-man 4 if they do indeed make another one will give us the Spider-man movie we've been waiting for with a compelling story, well developed characters, menacing villains, and more action.",4,1,2,18 May 2009
Resident Evil: Extinction," Resident Evil Extinction Okay But Still Flawed
","Resident Evil Extinction is okay but still flawed from director Russell Mulcahy who's admirable in making this third film but the lack of character development, more suspense, and a disappointing third act surprise villain are what weighed this one down the most at least to me. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter, Ian Glen, Mike Epps, and Oded Fehr who's part like many others unfortunately is cut kind of short near the end. The rest of the cast including a brief cameo appearance by Ashanti are okay in their small parts but none of them get a chance to shine because they're written out of the movie rather quickly. The action sequences are well executed and paced. The special effects including the zombies and brief appearances by other creatures are impressive. The villain near the end known as The Tyrant who Glen's character turns into looks terrifying and deadly but his anti-climatic showdown with Jovovich near the conclusion is a letdown. The twist at the end was a bit of a surprise and the ending does leave it open for another one but I think three is enough for now. This movie isn't really that bad there are just flaws that weigh it down which could've been improved . Overall Resident Evil Extinction is decent with enough action, bloody deaths, good special effects, some suspense, a little humor, and solid performances by the cast who make this third entry in the trilogy worth watching but it could've been a lot better.",6,2,3,18 June 2009
The Prestige," The Prestige An Entertaining Thriller
","The Prestige is an entertaining thriller from writer/director Christpher Nothan the man behind films like Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. The Prestige is about two magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden whose friendship turns into an intense rivalry that leads them on a life long battle for supremacy. Hugh Jackman stars as Angier and Christian Bale plays Borden who also worked with Nolan on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Jackman and Bale are great in their roles portraying men who are driven to be the greatest magician in the world. Michael Caine is fantastic as always playing Cutter a man who builds and constructs illusion tricks. Scarlet Johannssan is strikingly beautiful as both Angier's and Borden's lover assistant Olivia. She brings a lot to the small role she does have in the film. David Bowie also does a solid job with his role as brilliant scientist Nikola Tesla. The rest of the cast including Piper Perabo as Angier's wife Julia, Rebecca Hall as Bordens wife Sarah, and Andy Serkis as Telsa's friend Allie are believable in their supporting roles. Director Christopher Nolan does a great job with the period setting and the mood of the film. Even with a running time of 130 minutes the film is never slow which helps draw the audience into the story. The plot for the most part is complex but never complicated but does require a couple of viewings to full understand what the movie was all about.

The Terminator," Terminator A Good Sci-Fi Film With Some Flaws
","The Terminator is a good sci-fi film with some flaws but it does have a compelling story, plenty of action, character development, suspense, great special effects especially for that time, and solid performances by the whole cast. I did prefer T2 and most recently Terminator Salvation over this one but the original is still a good film. Writer/Director James Cameron the man behind films like Titanic, True Lies, Alien 2, and the upcoming Avatar showed a real talent as a filmmaker with this movie which was his second one back then. Cameron is one of the best writer/directors out there and he continues to prove just that with every one of his movies. The cast are great in their roles bringing to life these imaginary characters Cameron created for the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is fantastic in the title role. He may not have many lines and his screen time is cut a little short near the end well sort of Schwarzenegger still proves to be an effective villain. He was born to play The Terminator a ruthless cyborg from the future that will stop at nothing until it's mission is complete. Michael Biehn is equally impressive as time traveler Kyle Reese from the future. He gets just as much screen time if not a little more than Schwarzenegger and Biehn makes the best of his role as the hero in the movie. He brings an intensity to his performance which makes his believable as a time traveler whose mission is to protect Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton. She's also very good in the role of Sarah an ordinary woman who must find the strength within herself to stop the Terminator before he kills her. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but they're not given much to do and really any screen time to leave an impression. The whole story of the film would take me forever to fully explain so I'm not going to get into it. It's better to just watch the Terminator before knowing too much what the movie is about before any spoilers could ruin the experience. The action is pretty much non-stop making the film move at a steady pace as the main characters are introduced and the chase begins to get to Sarah Connor first. All the crashes, explosions, chases, fights, and narrow escapes are well executed most of them looking very realistic. The special effects are state of the art especially for movies back then considering they didn't have the technology available today. The few flashback sequences with Reese showing a post Judgment Day are just as good. The world is an apocalyptic wasteland overrun by machines bent on annihilating the human race. Despite some flaws with the dialogue occasionally, answered questions, and somewhat rushed love story although it had to happen or else John Connor wouldn't exist, The Terminator is still a solid sci-fi film. It's much better than other ones out there like Ultraviolet, Babylon A.D., or Aeon Flux to name a few no offense. Overall The Terminator is an entertaining sci-fi adventure definitely worth watching with plenty of action, great special effects, thrills, suspense, drama, some humor, a little romance, and terrific performances by the cast.",7,2,5,12 June 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hellboy 2 A Step Up From The First One
","Hellboy 2 is a step up from the first one but with some flaws. Director Guillermo del Toro returns and gives us a worthy follow up to the original film. He continues to prove his talent and wild imagination with some of the new various creatures that are in this one. Most of them may only get blink or you missed it cameos while others get a little more screen time but they all look great and at least somewhat realistic. The cast minus Rupert Evans as John Myers from the first one are back and they're still solid in their roles especially Ron Perlman as Hellboy. Ron Perlman continues to be the perfect choice for the role portraying him as a demon with a conscience who does care about other people but even his character in this one seems to get less screen time than he did in the previous film. Which isn't really a bad thing but Perlman should have had a little more screen time. Selma Blair, Jeffrey Tambor, and Doug Jones reprise their roles from the first one turning in good performances. Luke Goss joins the cast as the villain a highly skilled elf Prince named Nuada. Goss does a decent job with the part he does play in the movie. He makes for an effective adversary and a challenge to Hellboy. Well done. John Hurt even shows up for a cameo appearance and does the best he can with the brief role in the movie. There's more action in this one which is impressive but nothing we haven't really seen before. The special effects are great and the new creatures shown in this one maybe very brief but they all work well with the imaginary world these characters inhabit in the film. Overall despite some flaws with the pacing and CGI Hellboy 2 is better than the first one. It has just the right amount of action, some suspense, humor, a little romance, and impressive performances from the cast especially Perlman who may get a little less screen time than in the original but he still makes it an entertaining comic book movie to watch.",8,2,3,7 June 2009
Ocean's Twelve," Oceans Twelve Good But With Some Flaws
","Oceans Twelve is another good caper film but with some flaws. It's not as good as the first one but the movie isn't that bad either. The all star ensemble cast makes it worth seeing though including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, the late Bernie Mac and Julia Roberts are still great in their roles not matter how big or small their part is in the movie. Also returning from the original are Carl Reiner, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Eddie Jamison, and Elliot Gould. Catherine Zeta Jones joins the cast along with Vincent Cassel, Robbie Coltrane, and Eddie Izzard are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Like the original it's best not to know too much about this one because there's some surprises in store for anyone who watches it. I wasn't as impressed with this one as I was with the other one but Ocean's Twelve is still worth seeing at least once. The film still seemed to be juggling too many characters and the pacing was slow at times again but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Overall despite it's flaws Ocean's Twelve still has an intricate plot, humor, drama, surprises, and exceptional performances by the whole cast but this sequel could've been a little better.",7,4,7,18 June 2009
Blade II," Blade 2 A Much Better Improvement Over The Original
","Blade 2 is a much better improvement over the original from director Guillermo del Toro who is admirable in making this sequel by amping up the action, improved special effects, and a more deadly villain(s). del Toro has shown his skill as a filmmaker in all his movies and this one is no different. Welsey Snipes returns as Blade and he's still a solid choice for the character especially in the action/fight sequences. In this sequel Blade forms an uneasy alliance with the vampire council in order to combat the Reapers a more deadlier breed of super-vampires who not only feed on humans but vampires as well. Kris Kristofferson also reprises his role as Blade's mentor Whistler and he's still effective in the part. Lucikly he's given a little more to do in this one. The rest of the cast are good in their roles including Ron Perlman, Lenora Verola, Thomas Kretschman, Norman Reedus, and Karel Roden in a brief appearance as a corrupt lawyer. Luke Goss a relatively unknown is the stand out as Nomack the leader of the Reapers. Goss makes for an imposing a villain who's a real challenge to Blade. Their final showdown at the end was a bit of a letdown mainly because it's over too quickly but Goss still makes for a great villain none the less under all the makeup used to create his character. The rest of the cast are okay in their limited screen time. The action/fight sequences are impressive and there's more of them in this one fortunately. The pace was fast mainly because of the action and some of the new characters are developed enough others no so much. The final showdown between Blade and Nomack felt rushed as mentioned before but it was still fierce and intense. The ending was fitting and the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Overall Blade 2 is better than the original with plenty of cool martial arts action, impressive special effects, some suspense, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (Snipes and especially Goss) who make this vampire sequel worth the time to watch.",8,3,34,15 June 2009
Alien," Alien A Solid Sci-Fi Film With Some Flaws
","Alien is a solid sci-fi film with some flaws but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Director Ridley Scott shows his talent as a filmmaker in Alien just like he has for all his movies some of which weren't as good as others. Sigourney Weaver is the stand out in the cast of course as Ripley the tough heroine who finds herself in one dangerous situation after another when a nightmarish alien beast begins to pick off her crew members on board a mining ship in deep space. Tom Skerritt is good as Dallas but he lacks screen time because his role is cut rather short. The rest of the cast are solid in their roles including Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto but most of them like Skerriit aren't really in that much. The special effects are amazing especially for that time and the alien looks terrifying like something out of your worst nightmares. The movie did a claustrophobic feel because of the confined space the characters were in because of the ship and there was a decent amount of suspense. The movie was a little slow in the beginning but once things kicked into high gear suspense wise it moves at a steady pace from there. Despite some flaws Alien is still an entertaining sci-fi horror thriller with suspense, great special effects, gruesome deaths, a scary alien villain, and exceptional performances by the cast especially Weaver who make it worth the time to watch.",8,1,4,15 June 2009
Shutter Island," Shutter Island An Excellent Suspenseful Thriller
","Shutter Island is an excellent suspenseful thriller with some flaws which I'll get into later but the good more than outweighs that bad in this one. Director Martin Scorsese is admirable in making Shutter Island giving audiences nearly everything they could expect or want from one of these films. Leonard DiCaprio is great as always as Teddy Daniels a US Marshal on route to a remote island for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a murderess who somehow escaped from her locked hospital room. Or as Ben Kingsley's mysterious head Dr. Crawley explains; 'We don't know how she got out of her room. It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls.' Leonardo DiCaprio brings an intensity to the role (like in Blood Diamond and The Deaprted to name a couple) and at times vulnerability. He continues to show audiences and critics his talent as an actor. This film is no different. Well done. The rest of the talented cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, and Max von Sydow in a small role are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Particia Clarkson, Elias Kosteas, John Carroll Lynch, Ted Levine, and Jackie Earl Haely are also very good in their brief extended appearances since most of the story's focus is on DiCaprio which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Shutter Island turned out to be much better than expected. It has an interesting story, suspense, an eerie mood, and atmosphere with strong performances from the cast. The movie also has some nice twists and surprises. One I sort of did suspect and others I found surprising to say the least. So it's better to avoid spoilers and watch this film without knowing too much about the plot for you to truly enjoy Shutter Island. I found this film to be much better than others who disguise themselves as suspense thrillers (The Grudge, The Happening, and Shutter to name a few). I enjoyed that Scorsese didn't heavily rely on CG except for some and instead used for the most part realistic locations and atmosphere to create the suspense. The location they chose for the island was a perfect setting for this story to take place and it added a lot to the movie. The flashback sequences of Teddy's time in World War 2 were an interesting touch that give us some insight into his traumatic past which continues to plague him while on the island. The pace of the movie was a little slow in the beginning before the suspense really started to kick into high gear but overall I can't think of all that much I didn't like about this film. Sure it might have some tiny flaws including a surprise I sort of saw coming but I thought Scorsese still did a good job with the execution of the twist none the less. In some ways Shutter Island reminded me a bit of the Shining because both films used actual locations, surreal images, and atmosphere to create suspense build up instead of relying on CGI. I was impressed with this movie and I plan to watch it again sometime because second viewings I think are needed to fully understand the story so it makes sense. Not that the story itself is very complicated but I believe Shutter Island's worth watching a second time even with a 138 minute running time because the film is that good despite it's few flaws. If you're in the mood for a suspenseful thriller or you're a fan of the genre, you can't go wrong with Shutter Island. It has an intricate story, suspense, twists, surprises, and solid performances by the cast (especially DiCaprio, Ruffalo, and Kingsley) who make this thriller worth the time to watch.",8,3,6,12 June 2010
Ocean's Thirteen," Oceans Thirteen Better But Still With Some Flaws
","Ocean's Thirteen is better than the other one but still with some flaws fortunately the good outweighs the bad. The all star ensemble cast are all terrific in reprising their roles including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Rob Reiner, Eddie Jamison, and Elliot Guild. Al Pacino joins the cast and he does a good job with his villain role in the movie. The rest of the supporting cast are solid in their roles as well. Like the other ones it's better to see Ocean Thirteen without knowing too much about the movie. The pacing was slow at times again and the film still seemed to be juggling to many characters with a few reprising their roles from the past films who only make brief appearances but all of them are effective in their very limited screen time none the less. Ocean's Thirteen despite it's flaws is a solid caper movie much better than some other ones out there. Overall Ocean's Twelve has humor, drama, excitement, surprises, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this third entry in the series worth the time to watch.",8,1,4,18 June 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Bourne Ultimatum One Of The Best Films Of 2007
","The Bourne Ultimatum was one of the best movies of 2007. It had tough competition with Spider-man 3 and Pirates 3 which at least to me were big disappointments compared to the Bourne Ultimatum. Matt Damon continues to prove how good of an actor he is in this film. He's the perfect choice as Bourne a highly skilled former CIA assassin who's trying to discover the secret behind his mysterious past. The rest of the supporting cast including Julia Stiles, David Straithan, Edgar Ramirez, Albert Finney, and Joan Allen are all great in their roles. I can't think of one thing I didn't think about this film. The ending fits the film and is a worthy addition to add to the impressive spy trilogy. As long as Matt Damon is up to playing Bourne again I can't see why they couldn't make more. Because all three Bourne movies have been good and is one trilogy that didn't end up being a disappointment. I was very impressed with The Bourne Ultimatum and is now one of the favorite movies. If you haven't seen this film yet then go see it now. You won't regret it.",10,2,4,11 May 2009
Burn After Reading," Burn After Reading A Funny Comedy
","Burn After Reading is a funny comedy from the Coen brothers whose other directorial credits include No Country For Old Men, The Big Lewoski, and Fargo to name a few. I won't reveal any spoilers because it's better to see it without knowing too much about the movie. Burn After Reading may not be the funniest movie I've ever seen but it's definitely worth watching because of the terrific performances by the whole cast. George Clooney is funny as Harry a philandering State Department marshal whose cheating on his wife. Frances McDormand is equally impressive as Linda Litzke an employee at Harbodies a workout gym whose wants cosmetic surgery. John Malkovich is good as always as Osbourne Cox a CIA Agent who quits his job after being demoted. Tilda Swinton is effective as Osbourne's cold wife Katie a doctor who's having an affair with Harry. Richard Jenkins is good as Ted Treffon the manger of Hardbodies who has feelings for Linda and Brad Pitt is hilarious as Chad Feldheimer a total goof ball whose also an employee at the gym Hardbodies. Pitt may not get a whole lot of screen time but he does a great job at playing a complete idiot. J.K. Simmons also shows up in a brief cameo role and does a solid job with the small part he does have in the movie. Well done. The Coens continue to show with the movie their talent and skill as filmmakers. So if you're a fan of comedies than you can't go wrong this one because Burn After Reading is worth seeing for the laughs and the exceptional performances by the talented cast.",7,2,3,6 June 2009
Watchmen," Watchmen A Decent Movie Based On A Graphic Novel
","Let me first start off by saying I've never read any of the Watchmen comics but I thought it was a decent movie based on a graphic novel from director Zack Snyder the man behind films like 300 and the Dawn Of The Dead remake. Snyder does a good job with his attempt to bring this graphic novel to the big screen but a slow pace, the lack of some character development, and overlong running time hurt it the most. Watchmen wasn't the best film I've ever seen but it certainly wasn't the worst either Shutter and The Happening to name a few. The movie takes place in an alternate 1985 America where costumed superheroes are a part of everyday society and tensions with the Soviets maybe leading to a third world war or worse. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Malin Ackerman as Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre 2, Mathew Goode as Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, and Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl 2. The three stand outs in the cast are Jackie Earle Haley who turns in a great performance as Walter Kovacs/Rorschach as a determined psychotic masked vigilante whose on a quest for the truth. Billy Crudup is equally impressive as Jon Osterman a scientist who becomes the emotionally distant Dr Manhattan after a bizarre accident turns into a blue superhuman god with amazing powers and the same can go to Jefrrey Dean Morgan as Eddie Blake/The Comedian a twisted cigar smoking psychopathic vigilante whose death kicks off the movie. Morgan isn't in it that much but he's effective in the small role. The rest of the supporting cast including Carla Cugino as Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre 1, Matt Frewer Edgar Jacobi/Moloch, and Stephen Hattie as Hollis Mason/Nite Owil are okay in their extended appearances but none of them are developed enough like Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan, Dan Drieberg, or Laurie Jupiter. The actor who played Richard Nixon was all right but I think they went over the top with him especially with his nose. People expecting a lot of action maybe be disappointed because there is enough of it but this film seemed to be more about the story which isn't necessarily a bad thing I guess. The action/fight sequences the movie does have are well executed none the less but nothing we haven't really seen before. The eventual twist as to the identity of the one who killed the Comedian I sort of saw coming but you might not. The sex scene between Wilson and Ackerman is steamy but it felt kind of unnecessary and the music playing while they're doing it didn't match at all. But Ackerman still looked great in either a leather outfit or without it. The film had a slow pace and the running time 162 minutes made it feel long which are two things that weighed it down the most. The movie is still worth seeing at least once because of the exceptional performances by Jackie Earle Haley and Bill Crudup. Despite some flaws Watchmen isn't really that bad of a movie it just could've been better. Watchmen has action, fist fights, blood, bone crushing hits, and good performances by the cast who make this graphic novel turned into a movie worth watching at least once as long as you can get past the overlong running time first.",6,2,4,24 July 2009
The Bourne Identity," The Bourne Identity A Solid Spy Movie
","The Bourne Identity is a solid spy movie with exceptional performances by the cast especially Matt Damon as the lead Jason Bourne a former government trained assassin recovering from amnesia who tries to unlock the secrets behind his mysterious past. Director Doug Liman is admirable in making this giving audiences nearly everything they could except from one of the type of films. Matt Damon is terrific as Bourne and he proves himself to be a talented actor especially in the action/fight sequences. The rest of the cast including Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, and Clive Owen in a small role as one of the assassins after Bourne are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The action sequences are intense and somewhat realistic others not so much but that's okay. The chases between mostly Bourne and people are him are also well executed. There is some suspense and a little romance for the women which balances well between the action. Despite some flaws overall The Bourne Identity was much better than expected. This movie has just enough action, some suspense, chases, thrills, and great performances by the cast especially Damon who makes the Bourne Identity worth the time to watch.",8,2,2,19 June 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," The Matrix Revolutions A Big Disappointment
","The Matrix Revolutions at least to me was the worst of the trilogy. The first one was great and the best of the three films. The second one was okay but could've been better. Revolutions isn't that bad action wise but the movie leaves many questions unanswered and the ending isn't the greatest either. The Wachowski brothers have done an admirable job of bringing the Matrix movies to the big screen but the last two films aren't as nearly as good or exciting as the first film was at least in my opinion. It was a big disappointment like Spider-man 3 or Pirates 2 to name a few. For those of you who haven't seen it yet I won't give way any big spoilers but I will say that it's worth seeing once only for the action but after a while even that becomes a bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong the movie isn't that bad it just could have been so much better. Keanu Reeves turns in a good performance as Neo the so called One who must find a way find a way to end the war between the machines and save his people from annihilation. Laurence Fishburne continues to be the best Morpheus who finds himself with Niobe in a race to Zion in order to help their people wage off the attack by the machines. Carrie Anne Moss is effective as Trinity making her a tough and skilled freedom fighter willing to sacrifice herself for the greater good. Hugo Weaving is excellent as the rogue Agent Smith who can make copies of himself and is beginning to take over the Matrix. Jada Pinkett Smith is equally impressive as Niobe another tough freedom fighter who journeys with Morphues to Zion. But unfortunately all their characters get even less screen time than they did in the previous one because Revolutions seemed to focus more on on the battle at Zion between the rest of the human survivors and the machines that are bent on annihilating them . The battle at Zion is amazing and it does last for a while but the movies loses focus on the main characters who made these films entertaining by the actors playing them. The other action/fight sequences are also well choreographed but most of them including the final showdown between Smith and Neo can't help but feel like a letdown compared to ones in the first Matrix film. The lack of screen time not only given to Reeves, Fisburne, and Moss but mainly to Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith is what really hurt the movie for me. Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss aren't given much to do except for some action/fight sequences their characters unfortunately take a back seat in this one allowing state of the art special effects to take over. Weaving makes for an imposing villain and does a good job with the small role he does have in Revolutions. After watching all three films it seems like the most screen time he got as Agent Smith was in the first one. His role got smaller in Reloaded only showing up for some scenes here and there as the movies went on his longest one being his first fight with Neo. In Revolutions his role is even smaller since his character disappears for larger parts of the movie than he did in Reloaded which is unfortunate because Weaving is great in the role. Mary Alice who takes over for Gloria Foster as The Oracle does a good job with the all too brief role and the rest of the cast are for the most part okay but none of them stand out. Another problem with the movie was the final showdown between Smith and Neo which kind of felt anti-climatic and rushed because their fight doesn't last very long at all. It's not nearly as impressive as their confrontations were in the first film or Reloaded. The special effects to create the machines and the brief scene in which their city is shown are an amazing sight to see on screen but spectacle alone doesn't make a good movie. Overall The Matrix Revolutions is another third movie in a trilogy (like Spider-man 3, Pirates 3, or X-Men 3 to name a few) that start off okay but end up being a major letdown compared to the previous films. Despite the cool action/fight sequences and special effects I really wanted to enjoy the rest of The Matrix Revolutions but instead it left me feeling very disappointed.",4,1,3,5 June 2009
Armageddon," Armageddon A Good But Overlong Action Aventure
","Armageddon is a good but overlong action adventure from director Michael Bay who does show his talent with this movie but the running time of 150 minutes does weight it down a bit. Bay none the less proves to be a skilled filmmaker no matter how good or bad his movies turned out. The talented cast are admirable in their roles including Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Will Patton, and Steve Buscemi. Jason Isaacs, Keith David, Peter Storemare, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Owen Wilson in a brief appearance are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The special effects are state of the art even though you can tell it's CGI. The action sequences are intense but it's the scenes in between and the slow pace at times is what hurt the film the most at least to me. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen including the song by Aerosmith and it fit the tone of the film.There was some suspense build up as the giant asteroid in space gets closer and closer to Earth while the heroes desperately try to destroy it in time to save their planet. The ending was touching but I found it to be a little predictable but fortunately the good outweighs the bad in this one. Armageddon isn't a great movie but it's not too bad either if it had been shorter I probably would've enjoyed the film more than I did. Overall despite it's flaws, Armageddon is an overlong but for the most part an entertaining adventure with just enough action, some suspense, thrills, impressive special effects, humor, a little romance, and good performances by the cast who make it worth watching at least once.",6,2,4,15 June 2009
The Village," The Village A Period Drama Disguised As A Horror/Thriller
","The Village is a period drama disguised as a horror/thriller from writer/director M Night Shyamalan whose other films haven't been nearly as good as his first one The Sixth Sense. M. Night shows talent and skill with the Village but unfortunately the bad outweighs the good in this one. The Village really isn't that bad but it could've been much better. The trailer to the film makes it seem like a thriller but I found The Vilage to be more of a period drama with some thriller elements. The movie does have some secrets that were surprising others weren't so much but surprises like spectacle alone doesn't make an entertaining film. The cast for the most part are believable in their roles of a small community of people who live in fear of the 'creatures' that live in the woods surrounding their village. Joaquin Phoenix is admirable as Lucius the soft spoken man whose curious about the world outside of their village community. Phoenix however isn't in it that much considering his role gets cut rather short and for the remainder of the movie it focuses mainly on a female character played by newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard the daughter of famous director/actor Ron Howard. Bryce is quite good as Ivy a beautiful and determined blind young woman. She brings some life into the movie and without her I would've given it a lower rating that I did. Well done. Adrien Brody does an okay job as Noah the village idiot whose role like Phoenix is limited but he is convincing in the small part he plays in the film. The rest of the talented cast including William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleason, and Michael Pitt are very good in their roles but they (like Phoenix and Brody) also lack screen time. The few scares in the movie if you want to call them that are well executed but those scenes lack suspense and didn't frighten me at all. The creatures looked cool but like some of the characters in the film they aren't in it that much and don't pose as a real threat to the village people. The music by James Newton Howard is fitting for the tone of the film and the location they chose for the village was excellent. The ending was all right but it didn't make up for what already happened before in the movie. If M Night had improved on the scares making them more suspenseful and more frequent than The Village would've been a pretty good thriller. Overall the film is a flawed attempt at a thriller the lacked suspense but if you've enjoyed M. Night's other movies than you might like this as well.",4,2,4,5 June 2009
The Hills Have Eyes," The Hills Have Eyes An Effective Horror Remake
","The Hills Have Eyes is an effective horror remake that was better than expected. This film is definitely not for the squeamish but if you're a horror movie fan than you'll probably enjoy this one. Director Alexander Aja has done a decent enough job giving audiences a gruesome horror film with the perfect location that builds up suspense as the movie goes and things continue to get even more dangerous for the characters who find themselves in a desperate fight for survival. The cast are admirable in their roles including Aaron Standford, Kathleen McQuinlan, Vinessa Shaw, Emile de Ravin, Dany Byrd, and Ted Levine. Some of the actors aren't in it that much (except Standford, de Ravin, and Byrd who get the most screen time) but they do make the best of their limited screen time. The same can go for the relatively unknown actors playing the mutant cannibals. All of them are believable and they play their truly frightening characters to perfection. The make up used to create their characters are incredible because they look realistic as far as horror movies go not to mention many of them are absolutely terrifying and scary. This film may not have had me wetting my pants but The Hills Have Eyes has its share of suspense and scary moments that will make you jump in your seat. The brutal deaths committed by both the mutants and the main characters are well executed fitting the tone of the film. The music also adds to the suspense and syncs very well with the feel of the movie. Also worth mentioning is the location they chose because it definitely adds a lot to the film because the desert in which the characters find themselves is totally cut off from civilization. A place forgotten by humanity where a race of mutant cannibals have been lurking in the shadows snatching and dismembering victims who dare come into their territory. The dialogue for the film wasn't the greatest at times and there were a few predictable moments but the rest of the movie made up for it's couple of flaws. Overall The Hills Have Eyes is an above average remake with plenty of inventive gruesome deaths, just the right amount of suspense, and solid acting by the cast thats sure to please almost any fan of the horror genre.",8,1,2,11 June 2009
American Psycho," American Psycho A Twisted Well Made Thriller
","American Psycho is a twisted very well made thriller with a knock out performance by Christian Bale from Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Prestige, and most recently Terminator Salvation. The rest of the cast including William Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chloe Sevigny, Josh Lucas, Samantha Mathis, and Reese Witherspoon in a small role turn in good performances but it's Bale who stands out amongst them. I won't say anything about the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet except that American Psycho is a thriller with some touches of dark humor powered by a great performance by Christian Bale as a wealthy New York banking executive with a taste for homicidal activities. The movie is definitely weird and different but in a good way. Director Mary Harron does a good job of bringing this film to the big screen and doing justice to the book. Well done. The film does contain strong violence, some graphic sex scenes, drug use, and strong language so parents should be warned before watching this with their kids. Overall American Psycho was much better that expected and most of that is because of the fantastic performance by Christian Bale who continues to show Hollywood why he's one of Hollywoods best actors. If you're in the mood to watch a good movie that's entertaining, different, and with some dark humor you can't go wrong with American Psycho. It's one movie among many that will not disappoint.",8,2,4,5 June 2009
Knowing," Knowing A Decent Sci-Fi Apocalyptic Thriller With Flaws
","Knowing is a decent sci-fi apocalyptic thriller with flaws from director Alex Proyas whose admirable in making this movie giving audiences some suspense, cool special effects, and well paced intense realistic disaster sequences. A slow pace however, unanswered questions, the lack of character development, and the ending is what weighed it down the most. Nicolas Cage is okay as the main character John Koelster but this isn't his best performance. No offense. If you want to see a good Nic Cage movie I suggest you watch Con Air, Face Off, or Leaving Las Vegas. Rose Byrne does what she can with her small role but her character isn't really developed because most of the focus is on Cage. The rest of the relatively unknown are decent but none one stands out. The movie starts off good because it's weird, different, and there is some suspense but there could've been more. The mysterious men in black were effective in their very limited screen time but they could have been more developed. The disaster sequences are well executed and intense because they look at least for the most part very realistic. The same can go for the special effects which may not be spectacular but they're effective none the less. The film does leave many questions unanswered that I'm not even going to get into because it would take me forever and the ending does sort of reveal some secrets but the conclusion wasn't the greatest. I can see that there might be some message with the way it ends but if they had changed the ending and improved some of the other things that weighed the movie down I probably would have enjoyed it more than I did. Overall despite some flaws though Knowing is a so-so sci-fi apocalyptic thriller with intense disaster sequences, some suspense, a few surprises, and decent performances by the cast but it could have been better.",6,1,3,8 July 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Terminator 3 An Okay Sc-Fi Film But Flawed
","Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines is a disappointment compared to the sequel that came before it T2 Judgment Day. Terminator 3 is an okay sci-film but flawed in many ways. Director Jonathan Mostow (U571) does a decent job of bringing this movie to the big screen but it could've been a lot better. Some action scenes are cool including a chase sequence early on but the dialgoue at times isn't the greatest which made the movie kind of corny. It's basically the same plot of the first film about a time-traveling terminator whose been sent to protect John Connor from another advanced cyborg except this time it's a woman known as the terminatrix. Whose idea was it to make the villain a female terminator? No offense to Kristina Loken who played the villain because she did do a good job in the movie but I just couldn't buy Skynet creating a female terminator. No offense. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns for the third time as another T-800 sent from the future to protect the soon to be leader of the resistance John Connor. Swarzenegger was born to play The Terminator and does a great job with the role but even he can't help this movie from being a disappointment. His talent and mostly everyone else's is wasted in this third adventure of the Terminator series that's basically the same story of the first two films. It offers nothing really new and besides for some cool action sequences and special effects the movie just isn't that good compared to the other three films. Nick Stahl from Bully and In The Bedroom plays Connor this time taking over for Edward Furlong. Stahl gives a solid performance of an off the grid bum who's running from a destiny he can not escape. Claire Danes from The Mod Squad and Stardust plays Kate Brewster who will eventually become Connor's wife in the future and his second in command. Danes is believable as Kate whose world is turned upside down after she has a chance encounter with Connor. The rest of the cast are good in their roles but this one is the worst of the fourth films in the Terminator series. It's not really that bad as far as the action/fight sequences, special effects, and most of the acting goes it just could've been a lot better at least to me. If you're a fan of these type of films and you haven't seen any other the terminator films yet. I suggest you see either the first one, Judgement Day, or the one that came out most recently Terminator Salvation with Christian Bale and Sam Worthington. Now those three films are worth watching unfortunately I can't say the same for this one.",4,3,4,1 June 2009
The Shining," The Shining Is A Scary Horror Thriller
","The Shining is a scary horror thriller from the late acclaimed director Stanley Kurbick whose admirable in making this movie based on a book by Stephen King by giving audiences almost everything they could except from this kind of genre. Jack Nicholson turns in a great performance of Jack Torrence a writer who slowly begins to slip into insanity because he's being influenced by the dark evil spiritual forces that haunt an isolated hotel in the mountains of Colorado where he and his family are staying as caretakers during the winter. Nicholson is convincing as Jack playing a man whose losing his mind because of the evil spirits that haunt the hotel. Shelley Duvuall is okay as Jack's wife Wendy but nothing memorable. None offense. The rest of the cast including the young boy who played their son are good in their roles as well. The Shining has enough scares, suspense, creepy moments, and surprises. The music seemed to sync well with the tone of the film. It also added to the suspense and creep factor. The running time of over two and a half hours does make it feel a little long but the rest makes up for the movies few flaws. With it's few flaws aside The Shining is definitely one of the best horror films out there and I recommend this to any fan of the genre if you can get past the long running rime. Overall The Shining is an effective horror thriller with suspense, scares, anticipation, creepy moments, surprises, and good performances by the cast especially Nicholson who make this movie worth the time to watch.",9,6,10,22 June 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Terminator 2 One Of The Best Sci-Fi Movies Ever Made
","Terminator 2 Judgment Day is a big improvement over the original. Writer/Director James Cameron returns along with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton from the first one. The story picks up many years after the original that finds Sarah Connor (played with vulnerability and intensity by Linda Hamilton) in a mental institution and her now punk teen son John (played to a tee by Edward Furlong) who's living with foster parents. John's world comes crashing down however with the arrival of a terminator (played once again by Arnold Schwarzenegger who does a great job in the role) whose been sent from the future to protect the young soon to be leader of the resistance from a deadly time traveling cyborg known as the T-1000 (played to perfection by Robert Patrick) an advanced prototype which makes it that much more dangerous. Soon The Terminator is in a race against time to protect Sarah and John from a formidable foe it may not be able to defeat. The whole cast are exceptional in their roles especially Schwarzenegger who does a fantastic job as the Terminator, Linda Hamilton still proves to be a perfect Sarah Connor, and Robert Patrick makes for an effective villain. He may not have much dialogue but Patrick makes the best of his villain role in the movie. Well done. Director James Cameron continues the story from the original and gives us a worthy sequel that is much better than the first one. From the intense action which is pretty much non stop, to the acting, to the characters, the story, the suspense, thrills, and some small does of humor this sequel makes for an enjoyable movie to watch. The special effects are amazing especially considering they didn't have the technology we do today. Despite some flaws when dealing with the time-traveling plot and some over acting at times the good more than outweighs the bad. Overall Terminator 2 is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made with plenty of action, chases, explosions, fist fights, amazing special effects, solid performances, a compelling story, and some humor that sure to please any fan of the series or genre. Go see it. Terminator 2 does not disappoint.",10,7,10,1 June 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," Monsters Vs Aliens A Very Funny Animated Movie
","Monsters Vs Aliens is a very funny animated movie from Dreamworks. Now I'm not a big fan of these kiddie movies but I have to admit that I found this one to be very humorous with a good story and well developed characters for the most part. I actually enjoyed it a lot more than most recently Transformers Revenge of the Fallen or 2007's Spider-man 3 to name a few which ended up being big disappointments compared to this one and other films out there. Directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon are admirable in making this movie that plays homage to the 50's monster films. The talented voice cast including Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, and Kiefer Sutherland brought so much to their roles. They all do a really great job and were just perfectly chosen for their characters. The voices some of them came up with for the characters matched very well and the movie was fast paced making the 94 minute running time fly by fast. The rest of the voice cast including Stephen Colbert, Jeffrey Tambor, Paul Rudd, Amy Poehler, Julie White, and Rainn Wilson are very good as well despite most of their animated characters only having a few extended appearances throughout the movie. Renee Zellwegger and John Kranski even lend their voices for brief cameos in the film. There was a good balance between the humor, action, and character development which some films these days have greatly lacked. The special effects and the action sequences are impressive. They weren't anything spectacular or mind blowing but they were well executed none the less. Even the animated characters seemed to have genuine chemistry together which made their friendships believable on the screen. The commitment by the actors and everyone involved in making this movie made that happen. The music they chose matched perfectly with what was happening on the screen and it added a lot to the movie. The only few tiny flaws were that things moved a bit fast in the beginning and some characters lacked development but the good definitely more than outweighs the bad in this one. This movie seems to be telling us a lot of messages about being true to yourself and that it's not whats on the outside but the inside is what counts. Just like you should never judge a book by it's cover. Overall Monsters Vs Aliens was a lot better than I thought it would be and it was just as good as either Wall E, Shrek, or Kung Fu Panda to name a couple. Monsters Vs Aliens has plenty of humor, action, character development, and a talented cast who help bring these animated characters to life making you care about them. If you're a fan of these type of movies than chances are you'll enjoy Monsters Vs Aliens just as much. Go see it much better than expected.",9,2,6,4 October 2009
Face_Off," Face Off One Of The Best Action Films Ever Made
","Face Off is one of the best action films ever made from acclaimed Hong Kong director John Woo. He's also the man behind films like Broken Arrow, Paycheck, and Windtalkers. The movie stars John Travolta and Nicolas Cage who really get to show their acting chops playing arch enemies caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse. For those of you who haven't seen it I won't tell you anything else about the movie other than it was awesome. Its one of my favorite movies because of the story, the characters, the action, drama, suspense, and humor. John Travolta is fantastic as Sean Archer a determined FBI Agent and Nicolas Cage is equally impressive as his nemesis Castor Troy a psychopathic terrorist. The rest of the supporting cast including Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, Nick Cassavates, and Alessandro Nivola are excellent in their roles adding a lot to each of their characters in the movie. With plenty of action, drama, suspense, thrills, and powerhouse performances from both of it's lead actors (especially when their characters switch identities) you can't go wrong with a movie like Face Off. Even with a running time of 140 minutes the movie is never slow at least not to me. So what are you wait for? Go see see it. You won't regret it.",10,5,9,19 May 2009
Spider-Man," Spiderman A Good Comic Book Movie With Some Flaws
","Spider-man is a good comic book movie with some flaws. I prefer the sequel over this one but the original is still a solid comic book film brought to life by director Sam Raimi and the talented cast. Raimi does a decent enough job telling the origin story of nerdy high schooler Peter Parker into the web slinging superhero Spider-man. The cast includes Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-man, William Dafoe as Norman Osburne/The Green Goblin, Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, and James Franco as Harry Osbourne. Maguire is admirable in his role as both Peter Parker and Spider-man giving us character who is nerdy but is willing to put others before himself. He's a teenager with problems and I think thats why people can identify with him. He's also a man in love with his beautiful neighbor Mary Jane Watson. Dunst as Mary Jane is okay as Peters love but isn't really given much to do besides eventually being the damsel in distress later on in the film. William Dafoe is impressive as Norman Osbourne and his evil alter ego The Green Goblin. I like the fact they made the Goblin a split personality a side effect of the performance enhancers his character takes in the movie. His costume did look a little corny and it resembled something you'd see in an episode of Power Rangers or something but Dafoe makes for an imposing villain none the less. James Franco is good as Norman's son Harry but like Dunst he isn't given much to do either except to show up here and there throughout the movie. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and Cliff Robertson in a small role as Uncle Ben are effective supporting characters. They both have good chemistry with Maguire making them believable as his characters aunt and uncle. Bruce Campbell has a brief appearance as a wresting announcer and he makes the best of his small part in the film. The special effects are state of the art and the action/fight sequences are well executed but at times you can definitely tell is CG which is okay but not as good as when you see two worthy adversaries without costumes duking it out instead of something created in a computer. The pacing in between the action was a little slow and the dialogue wasn't the best at times. Overall though Spider-man is still an entertaining comic book with just the right amount of action, some suspense, humor, a little romance, and solid performances by the cast that make for an enjoyable movie to watch.",7,1,2,9 June 2009
Collateral," Collateral A Solid Action Thriller
","Collateral is a solid action crime thriller from director Michael Mann the man behind films like Last Of The Mohicans, Heat, and upcoming Public Enemies. It was much better than expected because of the great performances by Jamie Foxx and especially Tom Cruise. The rest of the cast are good in their roles including Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, and Bruce McGill. Peter Berg, Javier Bardem, and Jason Statham also have brief cameo roles in one of the few movies that impressed me because I really enjoyed this film. Tom Cruise is electrifying as Vincent a cool calculating contract killer on the top of his game. Jamie Foxx is equally impressive as Max a cab driver who finds himself driving for Vincent while he takes out five people who are going to help bring down a dangerous crime boss known as Felix (played by Bardem). The rest of the cast are solid in their roles but it's Cruise and Foxx who stand out amongst them. The action sequences are well executed and paced evenly throughout the film. Michael Mann continues to show his amazing talent as a filmmaker with Collateral. It's got everything you could ever want in one of these kid of movies. Collateral has an interesting story, characters who are well developed, great acting by the lead actors, with just the right amount of action, suspense, drama, and some humor that makes for an enjoyable movie to watch. Go see it. If you're a fan of action crime thrillers than chances are you'll enjoy this one as well.",9,1,1,6 June 2009
Aliens," Aliens A Solid Sci-Fi Horror Sequel
","Aliens is a solid sci-fi horror sequel from director James Cameron whose admirable in making this movie. Cameron has show in all his movies his talent as filmmaker and this one is no different. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley set fifty years after the original which finds her character once again battling the nightmarish creature that killed her whole crew except this time there's more than one a lot more. Weaver is effective in the role and continues to be the best Ripley. The talented supporting cast are admirable in their roles including Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, and Bill Paxton. Some of them may have limited screen time but they make the best of their small parts in the movie. The rest of the cast are good in their roles too. The special effects are equally impressive especially for that time and the alien monster's still look terrifying including the Queen. The creature action is well executed and intense there's definitely more of it in this one than the original which made it feel a little more faster paced. Director James Cameron delivered on nearly everything that fans come to except from a good sequel by amping up the action, suspense, alien monsters, and body count which does make it a worthy sequel to the first one. Despite some flaws with character development the rest of the movie makes up for it. Overall Aliens is an entertaining sci-fi horror sequel with enough monster action, suspense, thrills, great special effects, terrifying villains, and exceptional performances from the cast (epecially Weaver and Biehn) who make this movie worth watching. Well done.",8,1,2,15 June 2009
The Fast and the Furious," Fast And The Furious Decent But With Flaws
","The Fast and the Furious is decent but with flaws from director Rob Cohen whose admirable in making this movie about an undercover cop who infiltrates an underground subculture of street racers in Los Angeles. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Paul Walker, Vin Disiel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, and Ted Levine but some of them (Yune and Levine to name a few) lack screen time. Ja Rule even makes a brief extended appearance but his character like others aren't in it that much to leave an impression. The racing sequences are intense but there's some you can tell is obviously CG which is okay because thats the only way they could ever show the characters going so fast in the movie. The action sequences are well executed but some of them can over the top at times. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either and there were some predictable things that happened. For those of you who have seen it you might know I'm talking about. If you're a fan of these type of films than you might like this one better than I did. Despite it's flaws though overall The Fast And The Furious isn't that bad it does have intense action/race sequences, some suspense, and good performances by the cast but the movie as a whole could have been better.",6,2,6,21 June 2009
American History X," American History X A Powerful Film
","American History X is a powerful film with equally impressive performances by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong as the two leads. Director Tony Kaye is admirable in making this movie thats definitely hard to watch at times about a former brutal neo-nazi skinhead recently released from prison who tries to prevent his younger brother from going down the same wrong path he did. Edward Norton gives a great performance as Derek Vineyard the former neo-nazi released from prison who has changed forever and Edward Furlong is just as good as his trouble younger brother Danny. The rest of the cast including Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Stacey Keach, Fairuza Balk, and Elliot Guild are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The movie has brutal violence, pervasive strong language, a graphic sex scene early on and then a rape, and nudity so parents should be warned to watch this first before allowing their children to see it. American History x is a powerful film and as mentioned before it's hard to watch at times but this is one movie that shouldn't be missed. Despite some flaws with the pacing this film was better than expected. Overall American History X has character development, drama, some brutal violence, and powerful performances by it's lead actors who make this movie worth the time to watch.",7,1,5,28 June 2009
Ocean's Eleven," Oceans Eleven A Slick Caper Movie With A Great Cast
","Oceans Eleven is a slick caper movie with a great all star ensemble cast who turn in terrific performances including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts among many others. Director Steven Soderbergh is admirable in making this film which is definitely the better of the remakes that have been coming out lately. The rest of the talented cast including the late Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner, and Elliot Guild are just as impressive as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Ocean's Eleven is a film thats better to see without knowing too much about it because any kind of spoiler can ruin some of the surprises in store for those who watch it. Despite some flaws with the film juggling a bit too many characters and a slow pace at times, Ocean's Eleven is still a good movie. Overall I was very impressed with this one and if you give a chance I'm sure you'll enjoy it too. Ocean's Eleven has an intricate story with just enough humor, drama, excitement, surprises, and exceptional performances by the whole cast who definitely make this caper film worth the time to watch.",8,1,3,18 June 2009
Resident Evil," Resident Evil A Decent Movie Based On A Video Game
","Resident Evil is a decent movie based on a video game but not the greatest from director Paul W.S. Anderson who for the most part gives fans of the game what they come to except from these type of films. The cast are good in their roles including Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crews, and Colin Salmon in a brief extended appearance. The action which is pretty much non stop once they reach the Hive involving people mostly shooting at zombies and creatures created by the T-Virus are well executed. The special effects are impressive but at times you can definitely tell it's CG. The zombies and the Licker look terrifying like something out of your worst nightmares. Well done. The dialogue however wasn't the greatest at times, it was a little predictable, and some characters are written out too soon for you to care about whether they survive or not. Depite its flaws though overall Resident Evil is decent with enough action, gruesome deaths, impressive special effects, some suspense, and good performances by the cast who make it worth watching but this movie could've been better.",6,1,2,18 June 2009
Quantum of Solace," Quantum Of Solace Good But Flawed
",Quantum Of Solace is a good enough action film but some of the same flaws except for the running time that were in Royale are also in this one. I'll get back to that later. First off Quantum Of Solace isn't that bad of a movie it just isn't as good as Casino Royale. Daniel Craig proves once again as he did in Royale that he makes for a great Bond especially in the action/fight sequences. Craig's Bond is a man out for revenge against a shadowy international organization known as Quantum who are the ones responsible the death of his love Vesper from Casino Royale. The action sequences which can go over the top a lot are exhilarating and Craig shows he's more than capable of doing some of the stunts himself. Well done. Olga Kurylenko (from Max Payne and Hit-man) plays Bond's ally/love interest Camille and Mathieu Amalric steps into the role of the villain Dominic Green a corrupt world renowned developer. The rest of cast are solid in their small roles including Jeffrey Wright who returns as CIA Agent Felix Leiter and Judi Dench as M. They both may not be in it that much but Dench and Wright make the best of their roles. Sadly I can't say the same for Giancarlo Giannini who is a good actor but his role in this film seems to be entirely wasted. He reprises his role from Royale as fellow Agent Mathis who could've been an important character but unfortunately his screen time is cut way too short. The rest of the cast are good in their roles. One main problem in Solace that was a flaw in Royale was the presence of a real menacing villain. Amalric does what he can with the character of Dominic Green but his villain ended up being a disappointment like the one in Royale. No offense to either actors but if they do indeed make another sequel they should try creating a worthy adversary to Bond who would be a real challenge to him. Very much like The Joker was to Batman in last years blockbuster hit The Dark Knight. A true arch nemesis who isn't easily defeated and proves to be a formidable foe to the hero. Despite it's flaws with a bad ass villain and some of the action sequences. Director Marc Foster does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen. If you're a fan of the Bond movies than you'll probably like this one as well.,7,3,9,1 June 2009
Alien vs. Predator," Alien Versus Predator A Disappointing Sci-Fi Horror Movie
","Alien Versus Predator is a disappointing sci-fi movie but to be honest I wasn't expecting much from this either so I wasn't too surprised that I didn't end up liking it. The movie was okay but it wasn't the greatest and I found it to be rather predictable. Director Paul W. Anderson has done an all right job of making this movie but unfortunately the bad outweighs the good in this one. The cast for the most part good in their roles including Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Lance Henriksen, Ewen Bremner, and Colin Salmon but most of them (except for Lathan) lack development and screen time because their written out of the movie rather quickly for you to care about their struggle to survive when they find themselves in the middle of a war between the nightmarish alien beasts and the deadly predators. Luckily Anderson keeps Alien Versus Predator at 100 minutes so it's not one of those films that seems to drag on forever (A.I., There Will Be Blood, or Spider-man 3). The action/fight sequences are okay but nothing memorable. The showdowns between Alien and Predator are letdowns because none of them ever last very long. All of them are missing that WOW factor you get when watching movies like The Dark Knight, Iron Man, or Spider-man 2. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either. Overall Alien Versus Predator isn't the best sci-fi adventure with so-so action sequences, good special effects, a little suspense, and decent performances by the cast but this movie could've been a lot better.",4,3,6,15 June 2009
District 9," District A Good Sci-Fi Action Thriller
","District 9 is a good sci-fi action thriller unlike any other but in a good way. It has character development, action, suspense, drama, and some humor to light up the serious mood of the movie from time to time. I can see why many people liked this film after watching it. Writer/Director Neil Blomkamp is admirable in making this movie to the big screen with a compelling story and impressive special effects that help bring the film to life. Newcomer Sharlto Copley is effective as the lead bringing a lot of comic relief to his role. He's believable as his character who goes through a major transformation during the course of the movie. The rest of the unknown cast are good in their roles too. The aliens looked realistic like a cross between insects and cockroaches. The special effects are great especially for a small budget independent film including the hovering space craft and the alien weaponry. The bloody brutal violence is well executed which mostly happens toward the second half when the action kicks into high gear. Besides some flaws with the dialogue at times overall District 9 was much better then I thought it would be. I actually enjoyed it more than X-Men Origins Wolverine and Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen which were okay but had many flaws that weighed them down. So if you're looking for an entertaining sci-fi action thriller, District 9 is the movie for you. It has character development, action, drama, suspense, some humor, and a very convincing performance by Copley which makes this movie worth the time to watch.",8,3,6,18 January 2010
Batman Begins," Batman Begins A Great Reboot To The Series
","This is the Batman movie I've been waiting for. The popular series has been on hiatus after the terrible 1997's Batman and Robin that nearly ruined the franchise. Well Batman is back and better than ever. In Batman Begins acclaimed writer/director Christopher Nolan explores the mysterious origins of the legendary Dark Knight. With an all star cast including Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Wanatabe, and Morgan Freeman. You can go wrong with a cast like that. Christian Bale steps into the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman. He's phenomenal in the role playing three very distinct characters in one film pulling it off respectively. He plays the angry grown up Bruce who's full of rage and guilt, the arrogant billionaire playboy persona he shows to the public who spends his days dating beautiful super models and buying things that aren't for sale. Christian also plays Batman and he's the perfect choice to bring this popular character to life in ways that none of the other actors were able to no offense. Bale's fantastic in it and makes us care just as much about Bruce as we do Batman. The voice he came up with is fitting for the character and didn't bother me. Michael Caine is superb as Bruce's most trusted butler Alfred providing comic relief and acts as Bruce's conscious keeping him on the right track. Liam Neeson is solid as the mysterious Ducard who is Bruce's mentor. He offers him guidance and eventually becomes one of the films main villains later on in the movie. Liam is effective as both Bruce's mentor and a formidable foe to Batman. Well done. Katie Holmes is good as Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes a childhood friend to Bruce and potential love interest. Gary Oldman is excellent as Jim Gordon one of the only honest cops left in Gotham City. Gary is so good you forget that he's acting. He inhabits the role of Gordon and is perfect for it. Cillian Murphy is exceptionally creepy as Dr. Jonathan Crane better known to comic book fans as the twisted Scarecrow. He's a gifted actor and his character does sort of take a back seat to Ra's in the third act but he was still good as the deranged villain. Tom Wilkinson is terrific as the menacing crime boss Carmine Falcone. He's the first villain Bruce faces when he returns to Gotham as Batman and Tom Wilkinson's role in the film may not be large but he proves to be another effective villain (like Neeson, Murphy, and Wanatabe) in the great ensemble cast. Rutger Hauer is solid as the greedy Mr Earle whose trying to take control of Wayne's company in his limited screen time. Ken Wanatabe's impressive as Ra's Al Ghul the cult leader of the League of Shadows. His part is very brief and he doesn't have much dialogue either but he makes the best of the small role of someone you definitely wouldn't want to mess with. Lastly veteran actor Morgan Freeman is fantastic as scientific genius Lucius Fox who works alone in the forgotten Applied Science Divsison located in the basement of Wayne Enterprises where Bruce finds the tools he needs to become Batman. Lucius helps Bruce in his quest of ridding Gotham of crime and corruption. His character may even very well know Bruce is Batman but there's an unspoken understanding and respect between them that grows into an admiring friendship. I quite honestly can't think of one thing about this movie that I didn't like. From director Christopher Nolan daring vision of bringing Batman into a realistic world to the great all star cast who are good in their roles to the exhilarating action sequences that at least felt very realistic and not something that was made up in a computer and of course the re-imagining the Batmobile known as The Tumbler. This Batmobile is truly unlike any other vehicle you've ever seen and they really did build it so the Tumbler can actually do nearly everything it does in the movie. It gets just enough screen time that makes you wanting more of it but in a good way. Also worth mentioning is the music for the movie by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. It matches perfectly with whats happening on the screen and the tone of the film. Batman Begins is a spectacular adventure with plenty of action especially the second half. It's now one of my favorite movies and I can't wait to see what Christopher Nolan has in stored next for the sequel. Nolan has taken this Batman movie and done justice to the character. It has character development, drama, suspense, and humor (from mostly Caine, Freeman, and some from Bale) with just the right amount of action thats well executed including Bruce's fight with Ra's in the Himalayan monastery perched on a mountain, and an intense chase with Batman in the Tumbler on the streets and rooftops of Gotham. The action packed monorail chase sequence finale will have you on the edge of your seat too and if you're not than something's wrong with you. This film had a great balance of character development, action, drama, suspense, and some humor. Nolan is admirable in making this film crafting an intricate story that's a character driven action crime drama that makes you care about Bruce and Batman while he tries to save Gotham from sinister villains instead of just making it into a special effects extravaganza with zero character development, a poorly written plot, and so-so action sequences. Yeah I'm talking about you Spider-man 3 and Transformers 2. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining action adventure based on a comic book. Go see it. You won't be disappointed with Batman Begins.",10,3,4,2 October 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Prive Ryan One Of The Best War Movies Ever Made
","Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made period. From the intense harrowing opening battle sequence to it's explosive yet touching climax, Saving Private Ryan grabs hold of you and never lets go. Acclaimed director Steven Spielberg brings this movie to the big screen and he continues to prove that he's one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood today. With a great cast including Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Barry Pepper, and Vin Disiel a relatively unknown at the time (in a small role) all turn in terrific performances. For those of you who haven't seen it yet I won't say anything else about the film. It's one of those movies you should see without knowing too much about it because that only enhances the experience. The battle sequences are jaw dropping, hard to watch at times, and realistic giving audiences a look at what these courageous men went through back then. The running time of 170 minutes did make the movie feel a little slow at times but thats a minor flaw and the good more than outweighs the bad. If you're a fan of Spielberg, the cast, or war movies than you'll love Saving Private Ryan. It's one of those films that can be missed.",10,2,3,19 May 2009
Revolutionary Road," Revolutionary Road A Tragic Realistic Love Story
","Revolutionary Road is a tragic realistic love story powered by the believable performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet who reunite 12 years later after starring in 1997's Titanic together. They still have that great chemistry together as before and the story of the movie is not a happy one but its pretty realistic look of a marriage slowly deteriorating. Leonardo DiCaprio is good as always as Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet is just as impressive playing his wife April who seem to have to be the perfect family with the house, the kids, and a good paycheck living in a Connecticut suburb in the 1950's. But appearances aren't always what they appear to be in this film directed by Sam Mendes. The man behind films like Road To Perdition, American Beauty, and Jardhead. He's also the husband of Kate Winslet. Mendes does another admirable job of bringing this tragic love story of the Wheelers to the big screen. DiCaprio and Winslet are fantastic portraying two people who do love each other but can't seem to make their marriage work. Dicaprio and Winslet disappear into their roles becoming those characters making you care about them and hoping they succeed. They both continue to show their amazing talent in this film. Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as well but her character isn't it that much. She shows up for brief appearances here and there because the main focus is on Leo and Kate. Michael Shannon is the only one to standout in the rest of the supporting cast who do a good in their roles as well. Shannon plays John Givings a troubled man who says whats on his mind without thinking twice about it and is the only one who can see right through the Wheelers. Shannon may not get a lot of screen time but he does a great job in the small role he has in the movie. He's also the son of the character played by Bates. The scenes where DiCaprio and Winslet lash out at each other are done well you can feel the tension between them growing with each passing moment as their arguments escalate. The period setting fits with the tone of the film and everything in it looked realistic giving audiences a look at what things were like back then. There are two sex scenes both involving Winslet so parents should be warned but none of them are too explicit like Monster's Ball, Original Sin, or Little Children to name a few. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in Revolutionary Road. The movie doesn't have your typical Hollywood ending but thats one of things I liked it about because life doesn't always have a happy ending. Overall Revolutionary Road was better than expected it's a tragic love story brought to life because of the exceptional performances from both Dicaprio and Winslet who make the film worth the time to watch.",8,6,9,8 June 2009
28 Days Later...," 28 Days Later A Good Horror Thriller
","28 Days Later is a good horror thriller that is sure to please any fan of the genre. With a cast of relatively unknown actors at the time (except for Brendan Gleeson) director Danny Boyle effectively brings to life the horrific aftermath of a virus that decimates London turning the infected into smart and cunning zombie like creatures full of rage. For those of you who haven't seen it yet I wont tell you anything else other than that. 28 Days Later is much better than some other ones that have come out recently disguised as horror films. (One Missed Call, Shutter, and The Happening to name a few) The cast of unknowns including Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Christopher Eccelston and Megan Burns are good in their roles of characters struggling to survive the horror of a virus that has destroyed their home. Brendan Gleason is great in the small role he does have in the film. He provides some comic relief and his character eventually becomes a father figure to all of them. Gleason may not have a big part in it since (spoiler) his role is cut short abut half way through or so but he does a great job with it. Well done. The make up and effects for the infected were fantastic and it made them look absolutely terrifying up close. The music was also good adding suspense and it seemed to sync well with the tone of the movie. Overall 28 Days Later is an effective horror thriller that was much better than I thought it would be. If you're a fan of these kinds of films than chances are you'll enjoy this one too.",8,2,3,18 May 2009
2012," 2012 A Decent Disaster Movie With Some Flaws
","2012 is a decent disaster movie with flaws which I'll get into later from director Roland Emmerich whose been known for making films of this genre like The Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day to name a few. Emmerich is admirable in making this movie giving audiences state of the art special effects with good performances from the cast for the most part. John Cusuak is solid as the lead Jackson Curtis a struggling writer and limo driver who tries to save his estranged family from the global cataclysm that brings about the end of the world. It has to do something with the earths core heating up because of solar flares from the sun causing massive volcanic eruptions unlike anything you've ever seen, destructive earthquakes that level cities, and giant tsunamis that destroy everything in it's path. The rest of the supporting cast are decent in their roles including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton, and Oliver Platt. Danny Glover and Woody Harrelson make the best of their small roles in the film. Glover is convincing as the President whose faced with many difficult choices. I felt Harrelson went a little over the top with his character at times but he still turns in an humorous performance though. The serious mood of the film worked considering it's about the end of the world and there's some humor that could've been better but thats all right. There were many yeah right moments when Cusuak and his family were barely escaping one disaster after another within minutes of each other but I was willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of the movie. As I mentioned before the special effects are pretty amazing even if you can tell it's obviously CG. The movie is nearly two and half hours which made it a little long, the dialog wasn't the best occasionally, and there were some predictable moments, but overall 2012 isn't that bad. For the first half hour or so Emmerich introduces us to the main characters developing some of them with strange things happening which foreshadows that the worst has yet to come. The last two hours I'd say is pretty much non stop action with Earth getting relentlessly hammered by earthquakes that take out cities in minutes, volcanic eruptions that shoot clouds of smoke and ash into the sky with massive fire clouds miles high, and gigantic tsunamis which engulf everything in it's path. The global cataclysms caused by the solar flares end up killing billions of people around the world with only a fraction surviving which does make the movie sad at times because you know none of them stood a chance against mother natures destructive power. If this does indeed happen one day I hope I'm not around for it because none of us would probably survive catastrophes like the ones shown in 2012. If Emmerich had trimmed the running time a bit, cut out some of the humor that didn't really seem to work with the serious mood, then I might have enjoyed it more than I did. Overall though 2012 was a decent disaster film but I wouldn't call it a classic. This film however is sure to please almost any fan of the genre. The movie has amazing special effects, plenty of action, drama, and good performances by the cast (Cusuak and Ejiofor) who make 2012 worth watching at least once if you can get past the overlong running time first.",7,3,4,5 March 2010
Ghost Rider," Ghost Rider A Halfway Decent Comic Book Movie
","Ghost Rider is a halfway decent comic book movie brought to the big screen but it's not memorable like Spider-man 2, X-Men United, Batman Begins, or The Dark Knight. The movie isn't all that bad. Ghost Rider is no Elektra, Punisher War Zone, Daredevil, or Spider man 3 but it's not that much better either. Director Mark Steven Johnson does an okay job of bringing Ghost Rider to big screen but the bad outweighs the good in this one. I'll get back to that later. Nicolas Cage whose recent films (The Wicker Man and Bankok Dangerous to name a few) haven't been that great but fortunately in this one he's all right as Johnny Blaze who becomes a hell blazing vigilante with a skull thats covered in flames for a face. Eva Mendes is decent as Johnny's love Roxanne Simpson but she doesn't really get much to do. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Wes Bentley as the devil's son Blackheart, Sam Elliot as a mysterious cemetery caretaker, and Peter Fonda as Satan himself. Donal Logue makes a brief appearance as Johnny's friend Mack and he does a good job with the small part but he like many other characters in the film doesn't have much to do and lacks screen time. Some other flaws with this movie was that the dialogue wasn't the greatest at times, the CGI to create Ghost Rider and his bike looks cool but nothing we haven't seen before, the action/fight sequences are good but none of them stand out and the lack of a central villain. There are about three other villains for Ghost Rider to face besides Bentley and Fonda. The special effects used to create their powers were impressive but none of them are in it long enough to leave an impression. If you're a Nicolas Cage fan you might like this one better than I did because Ghost Rider isn't one of his best movies. No offense to Cage who is a good actor but Ghost Rider overall is a movie that could've been much better than it was.",5,7,10,7 June 2009
Hellboy," Hellboy A Decent Comic Book Movie
","Hellboy is a decent comic book movie from director Guillermo del Toro who shows some real talent and skill with this film. It may not be a masterpiece or a classic but Hellboy is much better than some of the other comic books that have been made into movies lately. The cast are solid in their roles including Ron Perlman whose nearly unrecognizable as the title character, Selma Blair, Karel Roden, Rupert Evans, Jeffrey Tambor, and John Hurt. The rest of the supporting cast are good in their small parts they have in the movie. The action/fight sequences are well executed and the special effects are impressive but nothing very memorable. The various creatures in it look cool but most of them only get brief cameo appearances and none of them really stand out. However with it's flaws aside Hellboy is still worth watching because of the story, the action, humor, and the exceptional performances by the cast especially Perlman who shows his talent in this movie. Well done. Hellboy may not be the greatest comic book movie ever made but it's certainly not the worst either.",7,1,1,7 June 2009
The Mist," The Mist An Effective Horror Thriller With Some Flaws
","The Mist is an effective horror thriller with some flaws from director Frank Darabont whose admirable in making this movie but unanswered questions, the dialogue at times, and the ending is what weighed the movie down. However The Mist is still not that bad it just could have been better. Darabont the man behind films like The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption continues to show his skill with this one as a filmmaker despite it's flaws. Thomas Jane is good as the lead David Drayton a movie poster artist who finds himself trapped in a grocery store with his son and many others when a freak storm unleashes nightmarish creatures that have a taste for human flesh. Jane may not win any awards with his performance but he's still convincing as David. The same can go for Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs Carmody in a rare villain role. Harden's character definitely has more than a few screws loose and can be as scary as the monsters outside lurking in the mist because she's clearly losing her mind. Harden is impressive in the role and she eventually gets whats coming to her. The rest of the cast including Laurie Holden, Toby Jones, William Sadler, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Andre Braugher in a brief extended appearance are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The movie does have some suspense, anticipation, a little humor, and the various creatures that come in all shapes and sizes are terrifying. Most of them are never clearly visible because they're in the mist so you only get glimpses which was okay but a clearer view of what they looked like would've been a little better considering several of the blood thirsty monsters are only given mere cameo appearances. All of them are still do their part but they could've been given more screen time. There is some suspense build up and anticipation which doesn't quite pay off but it's not entirely a failure either. A lot of questions are left unanswered except for one brief explanation as to where the creatures came from and how they got here. It was because of some kind of military experiment to create a window into another dimension which unleashed this whole other world with nightmarish beasts onto ours or something like that. A better explanation as to what happened would've also helped the film a little because it's better than no resolution at all. Some loose ends storyline wise aren't tied up by the end, the pacing was slow at times, the dialogue wasn't the greatest occasionally either, and some of the characters made stupid decisions which seems to be a trend horror movies have these days. The sequences involving a creature being shown in the mist or eating someone in a gruesome way are well executed but there could've been more of them. The special effects were so-so because at times you can definitely tell it's CG. The ending wasn't the best and if they had changed it the movie at least to me would've been much better. Despite it's flaws The Mist is still for the most part a good horror thriller better then most that are out there. Overall The Mist has gruesome deaths, some suspense, anticipation, scary villains, a little humor, and solid performances by the cast who make this horror film worth watching at least once.",7,1,3,22 June 2009
Stardust," Stardust A Pleasant Surprise
","Let me first start off by saying I'm not a big fan of these movies but this one surpassed my expectations and as a man I'm not embarrassed to say that. Without giving too much of the plot away for those of you who haven't seen it or read the book. Stardust is an action adventure fantasy fairy tale with a coming of age story, romance, and plenty of humor. The talented cast do a magnificent job including Claire Danes, Charlie Cox, Michelle Pfieffer, and Robert De Niro. Claire Danes was the perfect choice as Yvaine. Claire's strikingly beautiful, smart, and feisty completely believable as the fallen star who crashes to Earth. She's a remarkable actress one of the very best in Hollywood today. She's been excellent in all her films and continues to prove it in Stardust. Well done. Newcomer Charlie Cox also does a good job as Tristan the poor boy who becomes a man and later the hero. Claire Danes and Charlie Cox had great chemistry together that really showed on the screen. Michelle Pfieffer is a solid villain deliciously evil as the sexy witch Lamia and Robert De Niro is terrific as Captain Shakespare the fearsome pirate with a hilarious secret. In fact everything about this film was great. Stardust is fast paced even with a running time of over two hours and it leaves you entertained by the end. Not too many movies come along where you care for the characters and you feel part of the adventure. The director Matthew Vaughn did an admirable job doing that adapting the movie from a book by best selling author Neil Gaiman. He brought this fantastic imaginary world to life giving time for the characters and romance to develop with decent action sequences plus lots of hilarious moments that will make you crack up laughing at least I did. Stardust was a pleasant surprise from all the threequels that came out in 2007 some good - The Bourne Ultimatum and Shrek The Third - some okay but over-hyped and somewhat disappointing - Spider-Man 3 and Pirates 3 - and others that were just horrible - Rush Hour 3 to name one. Hollywood should really start making more films like Stardust with a compelling story, memorable characters who are well developed, action, adventure, romance, and humor instead of just trying to cash in on a quick buck. Overall Stardust was the perfect example of a great fairy tale done right. It's got something in it for just about everyone. Definitely one of the best movies that came out during the summer of 2007. As long as you enjoy watching movies and like to escape into a fantastic imaginary world for two hours then go see it. You won't be disappointed.",8,4,6,9 May 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Amazing Spider-man 2 A Mixed Bag
",The Amazing Spider-man 2 is a mixed bag there are some things I did like and others not so much which I will get into later. First off I'm not sure if Marc Webb is the right director for Spider-man. There was a lot of talking in this movie that didn't really go anywhere and not much action. Andrew Garfield really does embody Peter Parker/Spider-man. They got that aspect of the character down right. Emma Stone puts in a good performance as Gwen Stacy in her limited screen time. Jamie Foxx does what he can as Max Dillion who later becomes the villain Electro. Same goes for Dane DeHaan who pulls off a convincing performance as Harry Osborn. The rest of the cast including Sally Field and a brief appearance by Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn do the best they can with what little they were given. The action scenes are well staged when there is some but are very short and there isn't many of them. Maybe 5-6 action scenes tops throughout the film. Now onto the bad. Some of the dialogue isn't the greatest but this is coming from the writers of Transformers so don't expect anything like Nolans Batman trilogy. Electro was a cool villain visually development wise not so much. He did resemble Dr Manhattan from Watchmen I liked it nonetheless though. Unfortunately Electro spends most of the second half locked up after his first fight with Spider-man during the Times Square sequence. Foxx tried to elevate the material and gain sympathy from the audience but I blame the script and was given a couple cheesy lines. He did have godlike powers and they could have done so much more with the character. What was the point of having a powerful villain like that just to sideline him for the most of the movie till near the end. Just didn't make a lot of sense. DeHaan's Harry was actually well developed throughout the film but his Goblin is rushed and only gets at the most 3-5 minutes of screen time near the end. It's nothing more than a glorified cameo. He gets a brief fight with Spidey and then he's rather easily defeated like Electro. It's a shame because his look and laugh as Goblin was quite sinister. I didn't feel much of anything when Gwen met her fate because I just wasn't emotionally invested in the characters. They should've saved that for the next film and perhaps had Harry become the Goblin in a mid credits scene or something. I understand they're building up to the Sinister Six but it seemed like they were trying to hard to set things up for future sequels instead of just focusing on telling a coherent story. Paul Giamatti who I consider to be a good actor in other movies hammed it up way too much as the Rhino. He was just kinda stupid to me and his attempt at a Russian accent is dreadful. I couldn't understand almost a word he said luckily his character is limited to just 2 scenes. He wasn't pivotal to story besides providing the film with a few quick action scenes and to show the type of criminals Spider-man has been facing since the end of the first film. I really wanted to enjoy this movie but after it was over I was like that's it and just felt disappointed. Even though I had no expectations it was still a major letdown but that's just me.,5,2,6,25 May 2014
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Twilight New Moon Okay But Not The Greatest
","Let me first say that I have not read any of the books so I don't know how close it follows the source material. This film is certainly a chick flick but I got it for free from the library and I saw the first one so I figured how bad could it be right. After watching it I can see why many critics and audiences didn't like this sequel. I for one thought New Moon was okay but not the greatest from director Chris Weitz who does a decent job of making this movie but there are many flaws that weigh it down which I'll get into later. Kristen Stewart is okay as the lead Bella despite the films problems. This may not be her best performance but she's still somewhat believable as the character. I wish she could have shown more emotion of what Bella is supposed to be going through instead of just blank stares and blinking her eyes. Robert Pattinson is all right as Bella's brooding vampire love Edward in his very limited screen time. Pattinson fans will probably be disappointed because don't expect him in it that much. He shows up early on and then his character disappears for most of the movie only to reappear before the climax. Pattinson doesn't have much to do this time around but he does what his role requires I guess. Taylor Lautner is impressive as Jacob Black whose part is much larger in New Moon than the first one. Launter and Stewart felt more like the leads in this sequel than her and Pattinson in Twilight. Taylor does a convincing job as Jacob and makes the best of his larger role in the film. I did feel they had him take his shirt off a bit too much which felt unnecessary except to make teenage girls go crazy over his six-pack abs but Lautner improved on his performance from the previous one none the less. The rest of the cast including the Cullen family, Bella's father Charlie, and the werewolf shape shifters are okay despite only having a few minutes of screen time. Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning have what amounts to cameo appearances as dangerous vampires who feed on humans. Sheen and Fanning are decent in their villain roles but lack screen time and development considering they don't even show up until late into the third act. Sheen does make an appearance near the beginning of the movie but his character along with Dakota's Jane aren't in it long enough to leave an impression and don't have a lot to do either. The same can go for Edi Gathegi as the vampire Laurent who returns from the first one for a brief appearance before apparently biting the dust and Rachelle Lefevre as the revenge driven Victoria. Lafevre turns in an okay performance even with no dialog and only a few minutes of screen time. Pattinson and Stewart had nice chemistry together just as she did with Lautner. The special effects including the CGI werewolves were pretty good and the few action/fight sequences the film did have are well executed but aren't anything memorable. With the good things out of the way now I'll get into what I thought could've been better. The movie seemed to be juggling way too many characters with most of them (Sheen, Fanning, and the other members of the Volutri to name a few) getting the short end of the stick and the dialog was a bit cheesy at times. New Moon was a little slow at times making it drag which weighed the movie down a bit for me. Also Bella's 'reckless' attitude that put her in danger got a bit old at times because I mean how many times does she need to be rescued in one film. With it's flaws aside though, New Moon isn't that bad it just could've been better. It'll probably please almost any die hard fan of the book series. Overall Twilight New Moon has some action, a little suspense, and good performances from the cast for the most part but this wasn't the best movie I've seen. Granted I honestly didn't expect much since New Moon got mixed reviews but if director Chris Weitz improved the flaws somehow this sequel could've been much better.",5,2,4,21 March 2010
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Fantastic Four 2 Better Then First One But Still Flawed
","Fantastic Four Rise Of The Silver Surfer is better than the first one but it still has some flaws that are in the previous film. Director Tim Story does an okay job of bringing this movie based on a comic book to the big screen with more action and improved special effects but the camp factor hurts the movie as a whole. The cast are good in their roles including Ian Grufford as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Jessica Alba as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/ The Human Torch, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing, and Julian McMahon as their nemesis Victor Doom. Kerry Washington is all right as Ben's girlfriend Alicia but unfortunately she isn't given nearly enough screen time. Besides Evans as Johnny and Chilkis as Ben who stand out in the cast one of the best things about this sequel is the introduction of the Silver Surfer. In his first big screen appearance his character does leave an impression. He's played by Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne provides the voice for the character and they both do a solid job as the newest and more interesting foe/ally to the Fantastic Four. The rest of the cast are good in their small roles including Andre Braugher and Beau Garrett who at least try to bring life to their characters but unfortunately they lack screen time. As mentioned before the special effects and the action sequences are better then the first one but they're not as near as good as they could've been since none of them really even last that long. Some other problems I found with the film was that McMahon's character Doom didn't really need to be in it because they already fought him in the first one. McMahon makes for a good villain but his character takes a backseat to the Silver Surfer who at least to me is a much more worthy adversary with an interesting back story. A few other flaws were that it seemed Michael Chiklis lacked screen time too as The Thing and he wasn't involved in the action as much as he was in the previous one but he still turns in a good performance. The dialgoue wasn't the greatest at times either and the planet eating Galactus a popular character in the comics is given a brief cameo as this cloudy mist thing from outer space only showing up a couple times here and there before being easily defeated. With its problems aside however this sequel is still an entertaining comic book movie with good performances by most of the cast, just the right amount of action, some humor, cool special effects, and a little romance that keeps the film moving at a steady pace. If you're a fan of the first movie than you'll probably enjoy this one as well.",6,3,6,5 June 2009
Transformers," Transformers An Entertaining Action Adventure With Some Flaws
","When I first heard they were coming out with a live action Transformers movie I knew I had to go see it and I'm glad I did. It was well worth the price of admission brought to the screen by director Michael Bay who does a great job bringing this film to life. It does have some flaws but this movie was definitely better than expected and the good more than outweighed the bad. I preferred this first film over it's sequel Revenge of the Fallen which was disappointing compared to this one but hey thats me. The movie Transformers is about a young teen named Sam Witwicky (played perfectly by Shia LaBeuof) who finds himself caught in the middle of an epic war between two rival clans of alien robots, the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons after buying his first car an old beat-up Camaro (which turns out to the heroic Autobot Bumblebee). For those of you who haven't seen it yet I won't give anymore of the plot away then that. This film has dazzling special effects including the transformers themselves and just the right amount of intense action sequences that are well executed. There's also plenty of humor that balanced well between the drama, suspense, and action. Shia Labeouf is solid as the lead bringing a lot of comic relief to his role as Sam and he's believable as the character. LaBeouf does sort of sit it out in the beginning (action wise) but once the chase between the Autobots and Decepticons is on he's involved in the action a lot more. Megan Fox is all right as Sam's love interest Mikaela but she isn't given much to do except to be eye candy for the camera. Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duahmel are okay but their roles in the film seemed to get smaller as the film went on because most of the focus is on Sam but they both did a good job in their limited screen time. The movie could've done without some of the side characters played by Anthony Anderson and Rachel Taylor who are decent in the movie but that would've given more screen time to LaBeouf or any of the other characters. Jon Voight does his best as the Secretary of Defense Keller and John Turturro is very impressive as Simmons a wacky agent from Sector 7 a mysterious branch of the government with many secrets that are revealed. The rest of the supporting cast are good including the real military soldiers who are given extended appearances throughout the film. The special effects are state of the art some of the best I've seen in a long time including the transformers of course. The Autobots including Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, and Jazz all looked amazing especially when they transform because you felt as if they were really there. They may not show up for almost an hour into the movie except for Bumblebee but they're given at least some character development after they're introduced so you do come to care about them especially when the action kicked into high gear something the sequel lacked. The evil Decepticons looked cool but most of them weren't given enough screen time and have little to no dialogue. Megatron and Starscream aren't introduced until late into the movie before the climax in the city but they're effective as the villains. The only Decepticons to get any sort of development were Blackout, Barricade, and Frenzy but even they're MIA for large parts of the film only showing up for several extended appearances. The two characters I was a bit disappointed in were Bonercusher and Scorponok. Bonecrusher has a couple of scenes in the third act including a brief fierce fight with Optimus near the climax but he's rather easily defeated. Scorponok shows up for a few times in the beginning before disappearing for the rest of the film. The character has a 5 second cameo in the sequel near the end before being killed off that seemed pointless which made me wonder why they just didn't kill him off in this one. There's also a Decepticon tank thats credited as Devastator but it's real name is Brawl. The character didn't seem necessary like some of them except for one maybe two action/fight sequences. Devastator was later used for the sequel but unfortunately the character ended up being a disappointing villain like The Fallen. Barricade also disappears later on with no explanation and fans of the character don't expect him to make an appearance in the sequel either because he's still MIA but I guess like Scorponok, Brawl, and Bonecrusher they served their purpose despite only have a few minutes of screen time. The action packed finale between the robots and the military was intense but the shaky camera movements and the close ups made it hard to see what was actually happening at times but they worked for the film. Despite it's flaws Transformers is still an entertaining action adventure. Overall I very much enjoyed this movie and I thought it was just as good as The Bourne Ulimatum that came out that same year. It was better than Pirates 3 and Spider-man 3 which were disappointments compared to those two movies or most recently The Dark Knight which is still one my favorite films and probably won't be topped bu who knows. Even with a lengthy running time of 143 minutes Transformers is sure to please any die hard fan of the genre with plenty of action, suspense, humor, and good performances by the cast.",9,1,3,9 May 2009
Event Horizon," Event Horizon A Spooky Horror Thriller With Some Flaws
","Event Horizon is a spooky horror thriller with some flaws from director Paul W.S. Anderson whose admirable in making this movie about a rescue crew investigates a spaceship that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned with someone or something on board lurking in the shadows waiting for it's chance to strike. The movie is suspenseful, with some gruesome deaths, and solid performances by the cast. But there are some flaws that weigh the film down. I'll get back to that. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Laurence Fishburne as the hero, Sam Neill in a rare hero/villain role, Joely Richarson, and Kathleen Quinlan. Jason Isaacs, Richard T. Jones, Sean Pertwee, and Jack Noseworthy are effective as the supporting characters but some of them lack development because their roles are cut short. The special effects are impressive and the film does offer enough suspense but the ending wasn't the greatest. If they had changed the ending somehow it would've been a little better. There was some suspense but there could have been more and there weren't any real scares except for a couple of them. The movie does leave a lot of questions unanswered except for a few brief explanations from Neill's character about how the drive works and where it could have taken the other crew. I would have given it a higher rating if there was a clearer explanation to what exactly happened. The deaths however were well executed and brutal. The brief glimpses of people being tortured in grotesque ways were graphic and realistic. Neill's character was right when he says, 'hell is just a word the reality is much much worse.' Well his character was definitely right which doesn't mean good news for Laurence Fishburne and his rescue team who have responded to Event Horizon's distress beacon. Despite some flaws Event Horizon is still a decent horror thriller with enough gruesome deaths, suspense, and good performances by the cast that's sure to please most fans of the genre.",6,8,13,16 June 2009
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Resident Evil Apocalypse Action Packed But Flawed
","Resident Evil Apocalypse is action packed but flawed from director Alexander Witt whose admirable in making this sequel but the lack of character development, too many characters, real suspense, and a more central villain are what weighed it down. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Milla Jovovich, Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, Thomas Kretchman, Jared Harris, and Mike Epps. The rest of the cast are okay in their small roles of characters from the games who only make brief extended appearances before being written out out of the movie too soon for the audience to care about them. The action is pretty much non sop and impressive but after a while it gets to but a bit repetitive. The only one that really stands out is probably the one near the end which is well executed. The special effects and the make up artists have done a great job of creating the creatures including the zombies, dogs, Lickers, and the newest one introduced known as Nemesis who was actually Matt from the original. He mutated into Nemesis after being scratched by the Licker near the end of the first film. The Nemesis character is intimidating but he lacked screen time since there are other villains in this movie besides him. His showdown with Jovovich near the conclusion is a bit of a letdown like the third movie but it was fitting for that film. Despite some flaws with character development, suspense, and the movie juggling too many characters this sequel isn't that bad. Overall Resident Evil Apocalypse is a decent sci-fi thriller with plenty of action, amazing special effects, some suspense, humor, and good performances by the cast who make this second film in the series worth watching but it could've been better.",6,2,3,18 June 2009
Clash of the Titans," Clash Of The Titans Is Decent But With Flaws That Weigh It Down
","Class of the titans is decent but with flaws that weigh it down which I'll get into later. I thought it was all right but not the greatest. First off I didn't think it was very realistic that in a land full of bearded and long haired men Worthington's Perseus was clean shavin with a buzz cut. Worthington was okay as the lead but the role and performance seemed very familiar to Avatar and Terminator Salvation. Director Louis Letterier has shown in movies like Unleashed starring Jet Li and The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton his talent as a filmmaker. This on the other hand isn't the best movie he's directed at least not to me. I liked Unleashed and the new Hulk film more than this one. The rest of the cast is decent including Liam Nesson as Zeus, Ralph Fiennes as Hades, Gemma Atherton as Io, and Alexa Devalos as Andromeda with what little they were given because most of them don't have a whole lot to do (with the exception of maybe Fiennes and Atherton action wise anyway). Mads Mikkelsen was the stand out as Draco who gave the movie some much needed comic relief from time to time. Pete Posthewaite does what he can with his brief part. He's written out too quickly though for us to care about him. James Flemying is pretty good as Calibos/Acrisius despite a lack of development and screen time. Danny Huston makes a blink and you missed it cameo as Poseidon with one line of dialog before disappearing for the rest of the film. The dialog was weak occasionally and the movie itself as a whole felt rushed. The two most disappointing things were the Medusa creature and the Kraken mainly because they're hardly in the movie at all. The fight with Perseus and Hades at the end after The Kraken's dispatched was also a let down because it's over in the blink of an eye before you can enjoy the showdown between them. Some build up that doesn't have any real pay off. The Medusa action sequence was okay but the character gets 5 maybe 8 minutes of screen time tops before being killed off. The same can go for the Kraken that shows up near the climax to destroy a small portion of Argos and just when the terrifying beast's face is finally reveals it's easily defeated. It seemed like a total waste because it obviously took so much money to build this creature in a computer and to only show the Kraken for a few minutes was a big disappointment. This movie could've been a lot better. It has some character development (mainly Perseus), decent action sequences but none we haven't seen before, so-so acting from the cast and average special effects. The climatic final battle with the Kraken at the end however was a major let down. I actually thought Prince Of Persia was slightly better which had it's share of flaws but I found it to be more entertaining than this remake.",6,2,4,22 September 2010
Paranormal Activity," Paranormal Activity A Creepy Horror Thriller
","Paranormal Activity is a creepy horror thriller with just the right amount of suspense from writer/director Oren Peli whose admirable in making this movie that doesn't rely on cheap scares and CGI effects to entertain the audience. I actually preferred this one over the Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield because for the most part there weren't too many shaky camera movements. Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat are effective as the two leads giving believable performances as their characters. The suspense build up was good which doesn't quite pay off but isn't exactly a failure either. The sounds they came up with for the demon or ghost terrorizing the two leads were very effective and well paced throughout the film. It definitely helped add to the creep factor and the special effects are equally impressive for a 15,000 dollar budget. I think the demon or evil entity is seen only twice briefly as a sinister shadow proving that sometimes the things we can't really see can be far more effective than the ones we can. I enjoyed the fact that instead of relying on CGI and cheap thrills writer/director Oren Peli chose to use more practical effects like the sounds of footsteps, growls, a door closing shut, lights going on and off, and loud bangs to scare the audience. I wasn't very scared watching this but it definitely creeps you out. I suggest you go in not knowing too much about the movie otherwise any spoilers might ruin the experience for you. Overall Paranormal Activity was better than I thought it would be and it's worth watching. The ending is a little predictable but the good outweighs the bad. This film might not be up there with The Shining but its certainly no Shutter or The Grudge to name a few that weren't the greatest at least to me. So if you're in the mood for a suspenseful horror thriller than Paranormal Activity is the movie for you.",8,37,64,13 January 2010
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight One Of The Best Films Of 2008
","The Dark Knight is one of the best films that came out during the summer of 2008. It has a great ensemble cast, an intricate story, suspense, thrills, exhilarating action, and some humor. Director Christopher Nolan gives us a worthy follow up to his 2005 blockbuster hit Batman Begins. Christian Bale reprises the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman and he continues to be the perfect choice for the character. He portrays him with intensity as Batman and at times vulnerability as Bruce Wayne. The voice Bale came up with is fitting for the character and didn't bother me like it did for some other people. In The Dark Knight Batman finds himself in a battle for Gotham's soul against his arch nemesis a mysterious rising anarchist criminal mastermind known only as The Joker played with psychotic menace by the late Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is a mass murdering psychopathic clown with zero empathy and that's exactly how he portrays him. Ledger owns the role from his very first scene and gets some of the best lines in the movie. In fact the rest of the cast (Bale, Eckhart, Caine, etc.) also get some great lines like Ledger. This Joker isn't given an origin story and I think that was a wise move from Nolan. He's unpredictable a man with nothing to lose which makes him that much more dangerous. His character is an absolute a self prescribed 'agent of chaos.' Ledger gave this role his all and it shows in the movie. He definitely deserved that posthumous Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. Returning from Batman Begins are Michael Caine as Bruce's most trusted butler Alfred and Morgan Freeman as scientific genius Lucius Fox. Caine and Freeman aren't in it all that much but they make the best of the short screen time. They both provide some comic relief and the two veteran actors have great chemistry with Bale. Their characters are there for Bruce when he needs someone the most. Gary Oldman's also back as incorruptible Lieutenat Jim Gordon and is given more screen time. Oldman inhabits the role of Gordon and like Bale he continues to be the perfect choice for the character. Joining the cast are Aaron Eckhart as crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent. Eckhart is equally impressive as Dent the 'White Knight' of Gotham City and later the crazed psychotic revenge driven vigilante Two-Face. Eckhart gets the role of the character down and his transformation perfectly. The special effects used to create the burned part of his face are fantastic. Maggie Gyllenhall is good as Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes replacing Katie Holmes. She's a woman torn between two men and Gyllenhall makes the best of her limited screen time. The rest of the supporting cast also turn in good performances. Scarecrow fans however maybe a bit disappointed since Cillian Murphy's character only makes a very brief appearance in the beginning. I read some reviews complaining about Christian Bale's performance, his screen time, and that he played second fiddle making him feel more like a supporting character. I for one thought Bale was excellent as the character and he does get less screen time in this sequel than he did in Begins but he's still the main character. Bale turns in a solid performance and he gets a lot more screen time than some who make cameos while others show up for extended appearances through the film. Batman Begins was all about Bruce and his journey into Batman. The Dark Knight centers on four stories; Bruce Wayne longing for a normal life with Rachel while continuing his war to end crime in Gotham as Batman, The Joker's quest to bring chaos and anarchy to the city, the rise and fall of crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent, and Police Lieutenat Jim Gordons struggle to stay on the right side of the law who like many other characters finds his own morals tested. The Dark Knight more than lived up to the hype. There are many scenes worth mentioning that stood out including a daring bank heist that opens the movie with the Joker, Batman's introduction with the nefarious Scarecrow, The Joker's magic trick with the mob bosses, a snatch and grab with Batman taking on corrupt business men in a Hong Kong skyscraper, the interrogation between the Joker and Batman, the hospital scene with the Joker and Harvey 'Two Face' Dent, and an edge of your seat intense Tumbler/Batpod chase with Batman desperately trying to stop the Joker that results in the flipping of a semi. This film also has a great soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard who collaborated on Batman Begins too. It suits the movie and tone perfectly. Batman's new vehicle The Batpod is a perfect vehicle just like the Tumbler for Batman to get from one place to another. What I enjoyed most about this film was that after a few opening action sequences Nolan takes the time for the story and to develop the characters. The rousing action is well executed making it intense because it felt for the most part realistic and not something made up in a computer. Overall The Dark Knight is an exceptional sequel thats also a thrilling crime drama with plenty of action especially the second half which moves at a steady pace even with a 153 minute running time. If you're a big fan of Batman Begins or the character than chances are you'll enjoy the Dark Knight just as much. Go see it. You won't be disappointed this is one of those rare sequels not to be missed.",10,2,8,4 September 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Order Of The Phoenix Entertaining For The Most Part
","Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix is an entertaining film for the most part. It's a worthy addition to the franchise and director David Yates does an admirable job of turning this book into a movie which can go either way depending on how close they stay to the material. For the most part Order Of The Phoenix is enjoyable with some flaws. The talented cast are good in their roles including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, David Thewlis, Alan Rickman, and Gary Oldman are great in their supporting roles but most of them don't have much to do and lack screen time. The movie still seems to be juggling too many characters with some of them getting the short end of the stick. Despite its flaws the film still has some action maybe not as much as the previous one but they're well executed with great special effects, a little romance, and some humor that make it enjoyable. I do prefer the Goblet Of Fire over this one but Order Of The Phoenix isn't that bad of a movie. It just could've been a little better if the movie was faster paced with less supporting characters and more action.",7,1,2,7 June 2009
Blood Diamond," Blood Diamond An Excellent Film
","Blood Diamond is an excellent film with a compelling story, plenty of action, drama, suspense, and character development. The movie breezes by even with a running time of 143 minutes. Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific as Danny Archer a South African ex-soldier turned smuggler. DiCaprio has really established himself as one of the best actors in Hollywood today with films like The Avaitor, Gangs Of New York, Catch Me If You Can, Titanic, and The Departed to name a few and he continues to show that in Blood Diamond. Equally impressive are Jennifer Connelly as Maddie Bowen a dedicated journalist and possible love interest and Djimon Honsou as Solomon Vandy a Mende fisherman who finds a rare pink diamond that could help him get back his family. At first Archer uses Solomon in order to get the diamond so that he can payback his employer for a deal that went bad earlier on in the film but a bond eventually grows between the two men that becomes an admiring friendship. All the supporting actors are good in the small roles including Arnold Vosloo and Michael Sheen. The director Edward Zwick does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen which couldn't have been an easy task. If you're looking for an entertaining film to watch then Blood Diamond is the movie for you. It has it all action, drama, suspense, thrills, adventure, some humor and a little romance that make for an enjoyable film to watch.",10,1,2,9 May 2009
Taken," Taken Better Than Expected
","I saw Taken not expecting much just another routine action movie but it was better than expected. Liam Neeson does a great job as Bryan Mills a former 'preventer' spy who retired so he can be closer to his daughter and make up for time he lost with her. Mills quickly finds himself in a race against time to save his kidnapped daughter whose been sold into a sex slave trade in Paris. Neeson continues to show his skills as an actor especially in the action/fight sequences. With movies like Rob Roy, Schindliers List, Batman Begins, and Seraphim Falls, Neeson continues to show his talent as an actor in Taken. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Maggie Grace, Leland Orser, Xander Berkely, and Famke Janssen in a brief cameo appearance. The movie does have some intense action and fist fights that are well executed as Neeson's Mills wages a one man war against the men who have taken his daughter in order to save her from a terrible fate. Director Pierre Morel did a great job of making Taken more than just your routine action movie. At the heart of the film is a story about a father's love for his daughter and how far he'd be willing to go to save her. Morel keeps that story at the center while giving audiences some cool action sequences for guilty pleasure. If you're a fan of these type of movies. Then you'll also enjoy Taken. With just enough action, suspense, thrills, and some surprises Taken is sure to please anyone looking for a good movie to watch.",7,1,4,30 May 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Alice In Wonderland A Decent Re-Imagining Of A Classic Tale
","Alice In Wonderland is a decent re-imaging of a class tale from director Tim Burton who does a good job of making this movie that might have flaws but I still enjoyed it for what the film was. Johnny Depp of course is excellent as always giving audiences a much different Mad Hatter than we've seen before. He's nearly unrecognizable under all the make up and the voice Depp came up with is fitting for this interpretation of the Mad Hatter. Depp brings his usual charisma to the part and his character may not appear for the first 30 minutes but luckily he's in it a lot more after that. Depp continues to show audiences and critics his talent as an actor in this one. Anne Hathaway is all right in her short screen time as The White Queen despite not having a whole lot to do. Hathaway does provide a little comic relief and she brings what she can to her small role in the film. Helena Bonham Carter is effective as the villainous Red Queen who seems to enjoy saying 'Off with their head' when someone displeases her for any reason. Carter like Hathaway offers the film some humor and does what her roles requires. Crispin Glover is decent as The Red Queen's right hand man Stayne who likes big woman. He did seem to go a little over the top at times but Glover still turns in an okay performance. Newcomer Mia Wasikowska is impressive as 19 year old Alice who returns to the magical world from her childhood adventure. She holds her own against Depp, Hathaway, and Carter on screen in their scenes together. Wasikowski proves her talent as an actress with her performance as Alice who must find the strength within herself to put an end to the Red Queen's reign that has left a large portion of the imaginary world of Wonderland in ruins. The voice talents of Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Alan Rickman, Matt Lucas, and Timothy Spall are effective in their small roles that are more like cameos and extended appearances but they do what their roles require from them. Marton Csokas in a blink and you missed it cameo does what he can with his very brief part as Alice's father Charles. The rest of the relatively unknown cast are okay but no one stands out. The action which mostly happens in the second half and third act are well executed. The special effects are quite good even if you can tell most of it is obviously CGI. The world they created for the magical Wonderland however is just as impressive giving audiences a world where almost anything's possible. The pacing of the film was a little slow at times before the action started to kick into high gear, and some characters lacked development but there wasn't a whole lot I didn't enjoy about Alice In Wonderland. The second half set the stage for some action in the third act (the kind we've seen in Transformers, Iron Man, and X-Men 3 to name a few) which isn't necessarily a bad thing I guess because it's well executed. Overall Alice In Wonderland is a pretty good re-imaging of a famous tale that was better than expected. So if this sounds like a movie you'd enjoy, than chances are you'll have a good time watching it. Alice in Wonderland has a simple story, drama, action, some humor, a little suspense, and solid performances by the cast (especially Depp and Wasikowska) who make this movie worth the time to watch.",7,2,7,19 June 2010
Avatar," Avatar A Decent But Flawed Sci-Fi Action Adventure Epic
","Avatar is a decent but flawed sci-fi action adventure epic from writer/director Jameson Cameron who's admirable in giving audiences amazing state of the art special effects but some flaws which I'll get into later weighed it down for me. Sam Worthington turns in a solid performance as Jake Sully a paraplegic marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission who becomes torn between following orders and protecting the world he feels is his home. His CGI counter part is involved in most of the action but Worthington does what his role requires I guess. Zoe Saldana is very impressive as Netyiri a beautiful alien warrior instantly drawn to Jake who can certainly kicks some serious ass when she wants to. We never see Saldana only her CGI counter part but she brings life to her role and leaves an impression. Well done. Sigourney Weaver is good as always as Dr. Grace Augustine a scientist studying the planet of Pandora in her limited screen time. Michelle Rodriguez does what she can with her small role as Trudy a tough female pilot who eventually helps Jake in his quest to save Pandora from their own people. The rest of the cast are okay but none of them are really developed because most of the focus is on Worthington and Saldana. The special effects are fantastic including the planet of Pandora with breathtaking landscapes, floating mountains that defy gravity, and amazing creatures of all sizes but spectacle alone doesn't make a movie. Now that I've mentioned the good things about Avatar I'll touch on what I didn't like about it. I thought the story itself was very predictable right when Jake meets Neytiri I knew exactly what will happen next and how it was going to end. The dialog wasn't the greatest at times either. I felt Stephen Lang wasn't that great as the gung-ho Colonel Quaritch. I mean he gets attacked once by the the Na'Vi and all of a sudden he's hell bent on eliminating them off their own planet. I'm not sure if was really Lang's performance or the poor dialog he had to work with like 'Let's boogie', 'Shut your pie hole', and 'We fight terror with terror' to a name a few because to me he simply wasn't the best villain. However I was glad to see that his character finally gets whats coming to him. The same can go for Giovanni Ribisi who is a talented actor but this isn't his best performance. No offense. His role amounts to only a handful of extended appearances playing greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge whose after a precious material that goes for 20 million a kilo. Ribisi like Lang do what their roles require I guess playing stereotypical one dimensional characters but they were just jerks all the way through who felt no remorse for the crimes they were committing against the Na'vi. If their characters were developed more and had better lines they could've been memorable villains instead of making them feel like after thoughts. The pacing of the movie was slow at times making the 162 minutes drag and there wasn't as much action as I thought there would be because most of it is in the third act but it's well executed none the less. I was frankly a little disappointed with Avatar and it wasn't the classic many people are making it out to be. Don't get me wrong it's not the worst movie I've ever seen but I'm just not sure why a lot of people out there are hailing it as a masterpiece. Yeah the special effects makes it worth watching at least once but I thought it was going to be better. I read somewhere about Dark Knight fans and Avatar fans arguing which one they think is better. I for one enjoyed the Dark Knight a lot more and that one is 153 minutes but it moved at a much faster pace. No movie has been able to match it yet. Avatar isn't that bad of a film it just has some flaws that weigh it down. Overall Avatar has great special effects, action, a little humor, and good performances from the cast for the most part (especially from Saldana and Worthington) but it isn't the best movie I've ever seen. If you're a big fan of Cameron you may enjoy it more than I did after watching Avatar though I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.",Null,2,5,21 April 2010
Invictus," Invictus An Excellent Drama Based On A True Story
","Invictus is an excellent drama based on a true story with great performances by the two lead actors who really bring their A game to this movie. Director Clint Eastwood continues to show audiences and critics that he's one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood with this one. Morgan Freeman is superb as always as Nelson Mandela who after being released from prison soon goes on to become the President of South Africa. Believing he can bring his divided people together through the universal language of sport, Mandela enlists the help of South African rugby Captain Francois Pienaar to make a run for 1995 World Cup Championship Match. Freeman is so convincing as the newly elected president Mandela. He turns in another great performance among many proving his talent as a veteran actor. Matt Damon is equally impressive as Pienaar the rugby Captain who rallies his teammates to achieve what seems impossible. Damon may not be as tall as the real Pienaar but like Freeman he becomes the character and turns in a solid performance none the less. Damon and Freeman played off each other very well in their scenes together making the growing friendship between their characters believable. The rest of the relatively unknown cast are also very good as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. I can't think of too much I didn't enjoy about this film because Invictus was much better than expected. I mean I heard it was supposed to be good but Invictus still impressed me with how well Eastwood put it together which like many other films I'm sure wasn't easy. The pacing is fine except the 134 minute running time did seem a little slow at times and the satisfying ending I sort of suspected but those are two tiny flaws because the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. The real locations they used added a lot to the film making you feel for the characters and their situation. The movie in the beginning had a documentary type feel as well which worked in it's favor. So overall if you're looking for inspiring drama based on a true story, Invictus is the movie for you. I plan to see this again sometime because I believe it's worth seeing more than once. It's a film about how the power of hope and forgiveness can unite country. Invictus has a similar compelling story, drama, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (especially Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon) who make this movie worth the time to watch.",9,2,4,20 June 2010
The Last Samurai," The Last Samurai An Entertaining Action Adventure Drama
","The Last Samurai is an entertaining action adventure drama that was much better than expected. Writer/Director Edward Zwick is admirable in making this action adventure epic tale about Nathan Algren a disillusioned Civil War Captain who goes to Japan to fight the Samurai and instead ends up pledging himself to their cause. Tom Cruise stars as Algren and he turns in probably one of his best performances to date. In recent years he's been getting a lot of crap from the press because of his behavior but Tom Cruise proves to still be a talented actor none the less with this film. Cruise immerses himself into the character Algren who goes through a major transformation and he certainly shows his range as an actor. Well done. Ken Watanabe is equally impressive as Katsumoto, a Samurai leader facing a vanishing way of life, whose destiny becomes intertwined with that of the American Captain. Watanabe proves his talent as an actor giving audiences such a well rounded character in Katsumoto who eventually gains your sympathy because you know this man is willing to die in order to protect his people. Watanabe had nice chemistry with Cruise which really showed on the screen making their growing friendship and respect for each other very believable. Timothy Spall is convincing as Simon Graham a cynical Britich translator in his limited screen time who helps Algren in his quest. He provides a little comic relief from time to time that lightened up the serious mood of the film. Tony Goldwyn does a pretty good job as the villain Lieutenant Colonel Bagley whom Algren deeply hates despite not being given a whole lot to do in his short screen time. Goldwyn does what his role requires though. Billy Connolly does the best he can with his small part as Algren's old army colleague Zeb Grant whose written out rather quickly but like Goldwyn he does a decent job with his brief role in the film. The rest of the cast including the family Algren stays with while among the Samurai and the men who them played all turn in exceptional performances. The epic battle sequences are well executed/paced, intense, and realistic giving audiences a look at what warfare was probably like back then. For a film that's 154 minutes I was worried it would feel overlong like (Artifical Intelligence, There Will Be Blood, or Avatar to name a few) but the story kept my interest making the running time fly by at a steady pace. It's one of those rare two and half hours movies (with the exception of The Departed, The Dark Knight, and Blood Diamond which were about just as long but kept me entertained throughout it's running time) that I can watch easily without getting bored because the film pulls you in with a compelling story and interesting characters. In a way The Last Samurai shares similarities with most recently Avatar but I thought it was much better handled in this one than James Cameron's overlong sci-fi action adventure which was a letdown considering the hype built around it at least to me. The Last Samurai has some flaws the good however more than outweighs the bad with this one. A few characters (Connolly and Goldwyn particular) sort of get the short end of the stick development wise but I guess they're in a long enough so you know a little bit about them. Other than that though there wasn't too much I didn't enjoy about this film. Also worth mentioning is the music by Hans Zimmer which fit the tone of the film perfectly and was full of emotion. The location they chose for the setting was beautiful. It added so much with very little CG which they blended into the story seamlessly without going overboard on the effects (A mistake I feel Tranformers 2 made). Overall The Last Samurai is a well made action adventure drama epic that was much better than I anticipated. It's now one of the my all time favorite films along with The Dark Knight, The Departed, Batman Begins, and Blood Diamond to name a couple which were all epics in their own way. If you're looking for a good entertaining movie to watch than you can't go wrong with the Last Samurai. It has character development, just enough of intense action, drama, some suspense, a little humor, and impressive performances by the cast (especially Cruise and Watanabe) who make this film worth the time to watch. You won't be disappointed with this one.",9,2,3,9 May 2010
Titanic," Titanic A Long But Well Made Tragic Adventure Love Story
","Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.",8,3,5,13 June 2009
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry Potter Better Than Expected
","Let me say that this is the first Harry Potter movie I've seen and I thought I was going to hate it. But I found myself having a good time watching it. If I thought the first three installments were going to be just as impressive as this one. I would've watched them before seeing the Goblet of Fire. The whole cast including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are great in their roles. The rest of the talented supporting cast includes Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, and Brendan Gleeeson who also turn in admirable performances but they lack screen time only showing up for brief appearances here and there. The pacing was a little slow at times too but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Ralph Fiennes does a decent job with the brief cameo role he has near the end as the evil Lord Voldemort. He's nearly unrecognizable and Fiennes definitely makes for an imposing villain but he like other characters lacks screen time. Besides the pacing the film seems to be juggling too many characters a problem some other movies have had as well (Spider-man 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine to name a few). With it's flaws aside though this Harry Potter is a good film to watch. It has intense action, cool special effects, terrific acting for the most part, and some humor thats sure to please any fan of the genre or the book. If you've enjoyed the previous films so far than chances are you'll like this one as well.",8,1,2,7 June 2009
The Happening," The Happening Starts Off Good But Is A Major Disappointment
","The Happening is another thriller if you want to call it that from M Night Shymalan who rose to fame with The Sixth Sense. His career hasn't been doing so well with flops like The Village, Unbreakable, and Lady in The Water. Which at least to me weren't that bad but weren't the greatest either. The Happening continues that trend unfortunately but the first forty five minutes or so are promising but things go bad quickly after that. The movie was a big disappointment compared to The Dark Knight which was my favorite movie of 2008, Iron Man, Wall-E, The Incredible Hulk, and even Indiana Jones. The Happening starts off strong with people randomly killing themselves in horrific ways. The cast for the most part did what they could with their roles. Mark Whalberg, Zoeey Deschnael, and John Leguizamo in a brief cameo bring a lot to their characters but unfortunately the rest of the film isn't as good. M Night Shymalan is a gifted writer and director but this movie doesn't even come close to the Sixth Sense. The ending of the film wasn't that great either. It was predictable leaving me feeling sort of cheated. The music by James Newton Howard was fitting and seemed to sync very well with the mood of the movie. But the bad outweighs the good and this could've been a far better apocalyptic thriller than it was. M. Night had stated this was his scariest film yet but unfortunately it wasn't very scary to me. The only thing startling about it were the deaths by the people who were offing themselves in gruesome ways. If you're a fan of M. Nights films than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. If you're not then don't see it because you would've wasted 90 minutes of your life that you can't get back.",3,3,6,16 May 2009
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Reloaded A Good Sci-Fi Film With Flaws
","The Matrix Reloaded is a good sci-fi film with flaws from the Wachowski brothers who return to direct this sequel which may not be on part with first one but it still isn't that bad either action wise. The Wachowski brothers show some real talent and skill with Reloaded but more unanswered questions and the lack of screen time given to Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith including some other characters sort of weigh the film down. In this case though fortunately the good outweighs the bad. I'll start off with the good before going into what I think they could've improved to make Reloaded better. The cast are admirable in reprising their roles including Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving whose role in this one seems to be smaller than the original. Reeves still does a decent job as Neo the One who can now fly and begins to question his role to play as a battle between the machines and the rest of the humans in Zion the last city near the Earths core draws closer. Laurence Fishburne is still the perfect Morpheus who believes that Neo can save them from annihilation. I did feel as though he was more involved in the action in the first one than his character was in this sequel besides an occasional action/fight sequence, Fisburne still makes the best of his role in the movie. Carrie Anne Moss is believable enough as Trinity who's now in love with Neo and believes that he can save them from the machines. Moss like Fishburne gets several action/fight sequences that are impressive but her role doesn't seem as big as it was in the other one either. The same can go Hugo Weaving who definitely makes for an imposing villain as Smith the now renegade program who can make copies of himself. Weaving isn't it that much except for a couple fight sequences and most of his scenes are with well himself but none the less he still does a great job with his villain role. The rest of the supporting cast including Jada Pinkett Smith, Gloria Foster, Monica Belluci, and Lambert Wilson are admirable in their roles but none of them get much screen time. They show up for brief extended cameo appearances and thats about it. The same can go for some of the new supporting villains in this one who at the most make brief cameo appearances before being written out so none of them really leave an impression. Two of the new villains are known only as the Twins who besides one extended action/fight sequence aren't developed at all considering they show up very late into the movie only to written out rather quickly like the other new agents introduced. The two actors who played the Twins though still did a solid job with their brief roles in the film. The special effects are still amazing and state of the art. The action/fight sequences are equally impressive the ones standing out being the incredible highway chase and the fierce fight in which Neo takes on not one but around 100 Agent Smith's at once. The pacing was once again a little slow at times and the sex scene between Neo and Trinity didn't feel necessary. The movie also answered some questions but raises more that are never revealed which is sort of disappointing. The music once again is done very well by Don Davis and fits the tone of the film. The ending leaves off with a cliffhanger but it's not as surprising as it could have been. Overall though despite its flaws Reloaded is still an entertaining sequel that maybe flawed but there's plenty of action, great special effects, some suspense, and impressive performances by most of the cast that make it worth seeing at least once.",7,2,3,11 June 2009
Zombieland," Zombieland A Funny Horror Comedy
","Zombieland is a funny horror comedy which turned out to be much better than I expected. Director Ruben Fleischer is admirable in making this movie about four people trying to survive an apocalyptic world that has been taken over by zombies. The film has a nice balance between character development, the humor, and the action which mostly involves the zombies getting killed in gruesome but hilarious ways. The cast are very impressive in their roles including Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin who seem to be having a blast in this movie. Harrelson and Eisenberg have great comic chemistry with each other. They played off one another very well which made their growing friendship believable. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are just as good as two smart sisters who reluctantly join Harrelson and Eisenberg on a road trip across the country. The four actors also played off each other well during their scenes together. With that said, Zombieland ended up being much better than I thought it was going to be and the film left me feeling entertained. I can see why a lot people and critics for the most part enjoyed it. There's a surprise cameo by a well known actor halfway through who makes the best of his small part. I can't really think of anything I didn't like about this movie. Zombieland has it all character development, plenty of humor, drama, and a little suspense with just enough zombie action. I'd recommend you see this without knowing too much about it because it might ruin the experience for you. Zombieland is a very funny horror comedy with impressive performances by the cast especially Harrelson and Eisenberg who make it an entertaining film to watch. You won't be disappointed with this one.",8,1,2,14 February 2010
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Mr and Mrs Smith A Decent Action Film
","Mr and Mrs Smith is a decent action film from director Doug Liman the man behind films like The Bourne Identity, Jumper, and Go. The film is worth seeing because of the impressive performances by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as the title characters. The supporting cast are good in their roles including Adam Brody, Kerry Washington, Keith David, and Michelle Monaghan but they aren't given much to do and lack screen time. Vince Vaughn shows up for a small supporting role as Pitt's friend and fellow agent who does his usual thing playing a guy still living with his mother the only woman he trusts bringing some much needed comic relief to the movie. The action sequences are well executed with some going over the top but for the most part it's still an entertaining movie. The pacing may be a bit slow at times but overall Mr and Mrs Smith is a good enough action movie with solid performances by the lead actors that make it somewhat enjoyable.",6,6,12,8 June 2009
The Departed," The Departed A New American Crime Classic
","Martin Scorsese's The Departed is a new American crime classic brought to life by an all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farminga, and Alec Baldwin. The movie is about Billy Costigan (played perfectly with intensity and vulnerability by DiCaprio) a rookie cop who goes undercover to help his detective handlers (played by Sheen and Wahlberg in great supporting roles) bring down mob boss Frank Costello (played to a tee with menace by Nicholson). His character provides some of the comic relief which balances well between the drama, suspense, and action. Meanwhile, SIU officer Colin Sullivan (played effectively by Damon in a rare villain role) has everyone trusts who is actually Costello's mole. Vera Farminga also does a good job with the supporting role of Sullivan's girlfriend and Costigan's secret lover Madolyn and Ray Winstone is fantastic as Mr. French who is Costello's right hand man. From the great actors who all brought their A game, to the story, to the Boston setting, and Scorsese's direction of where he wanted to take this film is masterfully done. The film did feel a bit long at the end with a running time of 151 minutes but it's a minor flaw in what is a great crime film brought to the big screen. The film does have some strong brutal violence, strong language, and sexual content so adults may want to think about watching this movie with their children. Other then that The Departed is a terrific film with some twists, turns, and surprises that make for an enjoyable film to watch. So if you're a fan of crime films, Scorsese, or any of the actors in it then chances are you'll really like this film. Go see it. You won't be disappointed.",10,1,3,16 May 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen Decent But With Many Flaws
","Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen is decent but the film suffers from an overlong running time, a rushed finale, abrupt ending, and the lack of character development especially the Autobots and Decepticons. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times and some of the humor didn't work either. Director Michael Bay is an okay director but this isn't his best film because there's more of everything (robots, action, special effects and humor) in this one but it ended up hurting this sequel instead of making it better. Shia Labeouf reprises the role of Sam providing his usual comic relief and he's decent as the character. Megan Fox is all right as Mikaela but she isn't given much to do except to be eye candy. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are back too but even they seem to have less to do in this one. John Turturo is also back and he does a good job as Simmons . The special effects are top notch but it sort of becomes overkill after a while and the robot action/fight sequences are well executed for the most part. The only fight though that had any emotional to it was between Optimus and three Decepticons in a fierce forest showdown that leaves the Aubobots leader ready for the scrap yard because after that battle the action/fight sequences kind of become repetitive. This sequel definitely seemed to be more about the action and special effects than the story and characters. The biggest flaw this movie has is the treatment of not only the new autobots and decepticons but the returning ones as well because most of them with the exceptional of maybe Optimus, Bumblebee and Megatron don't get nearly enough screen time. Many of the new Decepticons introduced (like The Fallen, Devastator, Soundwave, Grindor, Sideways, and Demolisher among many others) only show up for a few minutes before either being killed or disappearing with no explanation. Except for Megatron, The Fallen, and Starscream the others have little to no dialogue who serve no real purpose besides one maybe two action/fight sequences. Some of the new Autbots including Arcee, Jolt, and Sideswipe aren't even given the proper treatment they deserve because none of them are in it long enough to leave an impression. Returning ones like Ironhide and Ratchet are MIA for the most of the movie. They both make a few appearances with little to no dialogue. They're not in it nearly as much as the first one. Even fan favorites like Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are MIA for large parts of the film but they're effective in their limited screen time. Megatron and Starscream get a little more to do than the first one by not by much. The two characters I was most disappointed in were The Fallen and Devastator. They both get at the most 5 to 8 minutes of screen time. The Fallen is an interesting character but he's killed off in his fight near the end by Optimus way too easily to be that much of a threat and he could've been a much more worthy adversary (His fight with Optimus lasts 8 to 10 seconds if that). The character Devastator had promise and looked like cool but the joke with the wrecking balls for his well you know I didn't find that funny. Devastator doesn't even show up until near the end and is easily defeated like The Fallen. Scorpnok makes a blink and you missed it cameo in the desert climax before being killed off five seconds later making the characters appearance rather pointless. There were simply too many robots on both sides. If they focused on the returning one mores and gave them more screen time while introducing some new robots it would've been better because some character development is better than none. The only two characters to get any sort of development were Jetfire and the Twins. I didn't find the Twins racist like some people did but the movie could've easily done without them giving more screen time to Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, or some of the other characters. Jetfire was another interesting character but I don't know why they had him speak with an accent. The abrupt ending left you wondering about what happened to many of the characters like Megatron and Starscream to name a few. There was also a part late into the film where Sam gets hurt and then a second later his hand is bandaged up so this seemed like an error from the screenwriters for not coming up with a better way to put Labeouf's real life injury into the story. For those of you who have seen it already you probably know what scene I'm talking about. The ending does leaves the door open for another possible sequel but I just hope if they do make a third film it's better than this one. The music also didn't really seem to sync well with the movie like it did with the first one and the raunchy humor was often funny while others no so much. The running time of 2 and half hours did make the movie feel a little long especially toward the end. Overall despite it's many flaws Trasformers Revenge Of The Fallen is a decent sci-fi adventure with plenty of robot action, some humor, and good performances by the cast but this sequel could've been a lot better.",6,3,8,22 July 2009
War of the Worlds," War Of The Worlds A Decent Sci-Fi Remake
","War Of The Worlds is a decent sci-fi remake from director Steven Spielberg who continues to show his skill as filmmaker with this one despite it's flaws. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, Justin Chatwin, and Tim Robbins. Miranda Otto makes a few brief appearances but like Robbins she doesn't get nearly enough screen time. Miranda Otto however is still effective with her cameo role in the movie. The rest of the cast are okay but no one stands out. The special effects are amazing especially the Tripods and the other aliens/machines that make brief appearances. The destruction left by the aliens is horrific showing audiences a war between humans and an advanced race of beings not from their world. The action is pretty intense and non-stop once the aliens make their presence known. The film may be a bit light on character development except for Cruise but the special effects and the action sequences make this remake worth seeing at least once. The pacing in between the action was a little slow at times and the film does leave a lot of questions unanswered which isn't really a bad thing I guess. Overall despite it's flaws though War Of The Worlds is a decent movie with intense action, great special effects, some suspense, and good performances by the cast who make this sci-fi remake worth the time to watch but it could have been a little better.",7,1,3,20 June 2009
30 Days of Night," 30 Days Of Night A Decent Horror Thriller
","30 Days Of Night is a decent horror thriller with an interesting premise. The whole cast do an admirable job in their roles including Josh Hartnett as Sheriff Eben Olsen, Melissa George as his wife Stella Olsen, Danny Huston as the ruthless vampire leader Marlow, and Ben Foster in a small role as a mysterious stranger. Hartnett and George do a good job as the leads of the film desperately trying to survive the onslaught unleashed by bloodthirsty vampires in an Alaskan town where there are thirty days of night. A perfect place for these kind of creatures if they could ever exist anyway. Huston makes for a menacing Marlow. His role couldn't been bigger considering Huston doesn't show up as Marlow for a while and he doesn't have that much dialogue either. But Huston makes the best of the role he does have as the sadistic vampire leader. The same can go for Foster whose especially creepy as The Stranger but unfortunately his part in the movie is cut short. From the action which is pretty much non-stop, to the suspense and horror, 30 Days Of Night is an above average vampire movie with just enough bite, blood, and suspense that does have some flaws but the movie over all is an entertaining horror thriller. If you're a fan of these sort of films then I'm sure you'll enjoy this one as well.",7,5,8,18 May 2009
Wedding Crashers," Wedding Crashers A Hilarious Comedy
","Wedding Crashers was a hilarious comedy mainly because of the great performances by Owen Wilson and especially Vince Vaughn. Director David Dobkin is admirable in making this movie about two best friends who enjoy to spend their time crash weddings and picking up chicks. Owen Wilson and Vincent Vaughn both made this movie worth seeing because of their great comic chemistry with each other. Their scenes together are worth seeing it alone. The film also stars a more restrained Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams, Isla Fisher, and Bradley Cooper who are equally impressive as the supporting characters. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles as well. A few of the supporting actors provide some comic relief to to movie but most of the laughs come from Wilson and Vaughn as their characters find themselves in one hilarious situation after another. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the film made up for it's few flaws. I was very impressed with Wedding Crashers because it's one of the best comedies I've seen in quite sometime. My parents even liked it which really surprised me. Overall Wedding Crashers has plenty of humor and exceptional performances by the cast (Wilson and especially Vaughn) making this comedy worth seeing because is sure to please almost any fan of the genre.",8,6,7,20 June 2009
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Blood An Overlong and Disappointing Movie
","There Will Be Blood was an overlong and disappointing movie from director Paul Thomas Andreson who does an okay job with making this but a really slow pace it what weighed it down the most. Daniel Day Lewis does give a great performance in this but even his talent can save the film from being a disappointment. The rest of the cast including Paul Dano, Cirian Hinds, and Kevin J. Oconnor are okay as the supporting characters but they lack screen time and development because most of the focus is on Day Lewis. The movie does have an interesting premise but the slow pace at least to me is what hurt it the most. If Anderson had made it shorter and faster paced somehow it would've been better. I was disappointed with movie because I hear so many good things about this one but I ended up hating it. Overall There Will Blood does have a compelling story with a knock out performance by Daniel Day Lewis but after watching this movie I felt disappointed because it could have been a lot better.",4,1,5,20 June 2009
Con Air," Con Air A Well Made Action Adventure With Solid Performances
","Con Air is a well made action adventure with solid performances by the cast including Nicolas Cage, John Cusuak, John Malcovich, Steve Buscemi, and Ving Rhames. Director Simon West does an admirable job of making Con Air giving audiences for the most part what they come to except from these type of movies. Nicolas Cage is excellent as Cameron Poe an ex-con and former ranger who finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control. John Cusuak is equally impressive as US Marshal Vince Larkin who joins Cameron in an attempt to stop the dangerous criminals who have taken over the plane. John Malcovich is great as the main villain Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom whose the leader of the criminals. Steve Buscemi is solid as Garlin Greene another psychopath who is brought into the plane in restraints when you first meet him before being set free. Ving Rhames is perfect for Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones one of the dangerous criminals working with Grissom. The rest of the cast including Monica Potter, Dave Chappelle, MC Gainey, Danny Trejo, Mykelti Williamson, Rachel Ticotin, Nick Chinlund, and Colm Meaney are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The action/fight sequences, the chases, and explosions are well executed. Despite some flaws with the film juggling too many characters, development, and a rushed finale. Con Air is still an entertaining film with plenty of intense action, some suspense, thrills, and exceptional performances by the cast who make it worth the time to watch.",8,4,5,15 June 2009
American Gangster," American Gangstter A Good But Overlong Action Crime Drama
","American Gangster is a good but overlong action crime drama with solid performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe as the two leads. They both continue to show their talent as actors in these movie despite it's flaws. Director Ridley Scott is admirable in making this film based on a true story about Frank Lucas a heroine drug kingpin from Manhattan and Richie Roberts a dedicated detective determined to bring him down. Washington and Crowe don't share a lot of the screen time together but when they do both actors make the best of it. Well done. The rest of the cast including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding Jr., Carla Gugino, Ted Levine, Joe Morton, Armand Assante, Common, and Idris Elba are effective as the supporting characters in their very limited screen time. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles as well. The film may be a little light on action except for some but it does have some character development, drama, some humor, and a little suspense but not much. What weighed down the film the most to me was the running time of 157 minutes. It had a slow pace at times making the movie feel long because dragged in some areas. Despite some flaws though American Gangter isn't that bad of a movie I've seen worse (The Spirit, Elektra, and The Wicker Man to name a few). Overall if you can get past the long running time first this film based on a true story is worth watching at least once mainly because of the exceptional performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.",7,2,3,27 June 2009
The Reader," The Reader A Decent Drama With Good Performances
","The Reader is a decent drama with good performances especially from Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, and newcomer David Kross. Director Stephen Daldry is admirable in making this movie about a brief affair between an older woman and a much younger man who years later now a law student re-encounters his former love as she defends herself in a war-crime trial. Kate Winslet turns in a great performance as Hannah and she more than deserved the Oscar she received for this one. Winslet continues to show audiences why she's one of Hollywoods most talented and bravest actresses today especially in the films steamy sex scenes. Ralph Fieness is equally impressive as the older Michael now a law student who still has feelings for his first love Hannah. Fiennes proves to be effective in the role as he does with most of the characters he's played in other films. Newcomer David Kross turns in a good performance as well. He shows some real talent and bravery especially in the nudity/love scenes his character has with Winslet. The rest of the cast are also solid in their limited screen time. The pacing of the movie was a little slow at times and some actors (like Winslet and Fiennes) weren't in it as much as I thought they would be but all of them are great in it none the less. Overall The Reader is a decent drama about love, consequences, secrets, and revelations with powerful performances by the cast (especially Winslet and Fiennes) who make it worth watching.",7,1,1,12 June 2009
Hancock," Hancock An Enjoyable Film With Flaws
","Hacock is an enjoyable film with flaws but it's still worth seeing because of the talented cast including Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman. Actor/Director Peter Berg does a good job of bringing this movie to the big screen with cool special effects, some intense action, and humor but the film overall could've been better. The special effects and the action sequences are well executed but unfortunately none of them stand out. I really wanted to like this movie which I did but there were something things that weren't the greatest. Some of the surprises I saw coming and the film lacked a villain who posed as a real threat to Will Smith's Hancock. There's one the movie but his character isn't that interesting just your average criminal who lacks screen time, development, and dialogue. Smith does a solid job in the title role playing a man with powers who doesn't want to be a superhero and is looking for answers to his mysterious past. Charlize Theron is good as always as Mary Embrey who looks at Hanock as if they've met before and has a big secret of her own. Jason Bateman is funny as Mary's husband Ray who is saved by Hancock and tries to help him change his image so that people will respect him. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but none of them have much to do. As mentioned before the special effects are cool but some of them aren't the greatest either because you know most of what you're seeing was done in a computer. Overall though Hanock is worth seeing because of the impressive performances by the cast who make it with your time. If you're a fan of Will Smith or you're just looking for a movie with some action and humor you can't go wrong with Hancock. If you can't get past it's flaws Hanock makes for a somewhat entertaining movie to watch.",7,3,5,7 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star Wars Episode 3 Much Better With Some Flaws
","Star Wars Episode 3 is the best of the prequel trilogy from writer/director George Lucas who has somewhat redeemed himself from the so-so previous films that came before this one. Lucas brings his two trilogies to a sad yet satisfying conclusion that reveals more unanswered questions and the ending helps bridge the events in this film to the ones that will happen in A New Hope. Ewan McGregor is much better this time around as Obi-Wan Kenobi and luckily has more to do. McGregor had an uncanny resemble to the older character played by Alec Guiness which made him that much more believable. Natalie Portman does what she can as Padme Amadala who is trying to keep her marriage to Anakin a secret. Her character also discovers she's pregnant with Anakin's child(ren)(Hint 'spolder' Luke and Lea). Portman gets less screen time than she did in the previous and less to do making her character feel like a supporting player who shows up here and there. Portman still does a decent job with her limited screen time. Hayden Christian reprises his part as Anakin Skywalker and he like McGregor seem much more comfortable in their roles this time. He also seemed more of a lead than Portman considering he gets more screen time since the movie does mainly focus on him and McGregor. Christensen's character goes through a major transformation in this one and he is convincing in the role. For those of you who have seen it I don't think I have to tell you who he eventually transforms into but I'll say it anyway. Christensen's Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader and his characters signature costume complete with that strange breathing sound are shown briefly revealing why he has to wear that suit. Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious is an effective villain who gets more to do including two light saber duels one of them is against Master Yoda near the end. Samuel L Jackson is back too as Jedi Knight Mace Windu but unfortunately his character's role is cut rather short. Jackson is good in his small role none the less. The same can go for Christopher Lee who also returns as Count Dooku from Episode 2 but his part like Jackson's is very small and he's written out of the movie quickly. The rest of the supporting cast including Yoda, C3PO, R2-D2, and brief appearance by Chewbacca are adequate in their small parts but don't get much to and none of them really leave an impression. Jar Jar Binks luckily makes a non-speaking brief blink and you missed it appearance before the conclusion. The special effects are amazing and the action/fight sequences are equally impressive. The ones standing out being the space battle that opens the film and the final climactic light saber duel between Ob-Wan and Anakin/Vader a very impressive fight sequence that was a bit long but very well executed none the less. The pacing was slow in between the action again at times and the dialogue wasn't the best occasionally either like the other ones but fortunately the good outweighs the bad. Lucas ends this film in a good way which could've been a little better but it was still a big improvement over the previous ones. Overall this film is much better than some of the other third movies in a trilogy that were disappointments like Spider-man 3, X-Men The Last Stand, and Pirates 3 to name a few. Despite it's few flaws Star Wars Episode 3 is still an entertaining sci-fi adventure with enough intense action, solid performances, and a fitting finale that makes this third film enjoyable to watch.",7,2,3,10 June 2009
Inception," Inception The Best and Most Original Film So Far This Year!
","Inception is the best and most original film so far this year. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has done it again given audiences everything they could ever want or expect from one of these movies. An intricate compelling story with plenty of spectacle, drama, and exceptional performances by the great ensemble cast. Nolan has proved with Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight his amazing talent as a filmmaker. This movie is no different. It's better to see Inception without knowing too much about the film. Leonard DiCaprio continues to show why he's one of Hollywood's best actors with his performance as Dom Cobb a dream thief or 'Extractor' who enters the dreams of others and steals ideas from their subconscious. DiCaprio handles the emotional scenes very well and I wanted to see his character succeed this difficult task of planting an idea into someones mind instead of usually stealing one. The story of him wanting to reunite with his children was very much the emotional center which comes through in between the thrilling action sequences that are truly one of a kind. Ken Watanabe is solid as the mysterious businessman Saito 'The Tourist' who offers Cobb the chance to get his life back by pulling off the difficult task of inception. Wanatabe's accent was a little strong at first but I could understand him better as the movie progressed you just have to listen carefully. Joseph Gordon Levitt is very impressive as Arthur 'The Point Man' who gathers all the information on their 'mark'. Gordon Levitt's zero gravity hallway fight may not last long but the scene is an amazing sight to see on screen while it lasts. And the fact that he did most of it himself shows his commitment as an actor. Well done. Marion Collitard turns in a haunting performance as the projection of Cobb's deceased wife Mal making her somewhat dangerous yet sympathetic at times. Collitard had nice chemistry with DiCaprio in their scenes together making the love between their characters that much more believable. Ellen Page is good as Adrianne 'The Architect' who helps the team create the dream world of their mark and navigate through that persons mind. She held her own against her co-stars and turned in a convincing performance. Tom Hardy is excellent as Eames 'The Forger' who can change his appearance in the dream world of someone close to the 'Mark.' I haven't seen Hardy in much except the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers but he's very effective as Eames who can kick some serious ass when he wants to. He also got some of the best lines in the movie which he delivers perfectly. 'I don't know. Not sure. See if he starts shooting at you. 'You must not be afraid to dream a little bigger darling.' Cillian Murphy shows he can play more than just villains as Robert Fischer 'The Mark' who tries to be like his father. Murphy proves to be another great addition to the ensemble cast Nolan assembled for this ambitious film. Tom Berenger does the best he can with the small role of Fischer's godfather Peter Browning. And Michael Caine is a bit underused as Cobb's father in law Miles who taught him about dreams because his role is more of a cameo (considering he only has two scenes one near the beginning and another at the very end) but Caine is still effective as Miles none the less. The same can go for Lucas Haas who makes a brief extended appearance as Cobb's former Architect Nash. He still does a good job with his small part in the movie though. I honestly can't think of one weak link in the entire ensemble cast. The special effects are quite impressive which is used to the films advantage because they felt realistic with cities folding onto top of each other and slow motion shots that pulled you into the imaginary dream worlds Nolan created for Inception. The action sequences are crisp and thrilling with fist fights, gun battles, and chases that are mostly in full view so you can see whats happening on screen. The last hour or so is pretty much non-stop action but in a good way with the characters entering dreams within dreams to pull off their most challenging task yet Inception. In a summer of remakes and sequels it was nice to see something original for a change. Overall I can't think of one thing I didn't like about Inception. It's definitely the film to see and one not to be missed. So overall if you enjoy movies like this you can't go wrong with Inception. The pacing was fine which made the 148 minute running time fly by fast. I didn't once wonder how much longer was left. It has an interesting story, some character development (at least for Cobb), and drama while still being packed with exhilarating action especially the second half. So go watch this intelligent sci action thriller. You won't be disappointed.",10,2,8,8 September 2010
Defiance," Defiance A Very Well Made Important World War 2 Movie
","Defiance is a very well made important World War 2 movie thats based on a true story. I wont say too much about it plot wise because Defiance is one of those movies thats better if you see it without knowing too much about what the film is about. Director Edward Zwick the man behind films like Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, and Courage Under Fire does a great job of bringing this true story to the big screen because it deserves to be told. The movie is about four Jewish brothers who escape into the Belarussian forest in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe where they and about 1,000 other Jewish people must work together as a community if they want to survive. Daniel Craig, Liev Shrieber, and Jamie Bell are very good in their roles as three of the four brothers. They speak with accents and are believable as these three Jewish men. The rest of the cast are solid in their roles portraying people who have lost everything and are now on the run from the Nazi's hunting them. Well done. The location for the forest where they build their village was a perfect choice and mostly everything in this film works. The action/battle sequences are well paced and very realistic. The pacing between the action was a little slow at times but the rest of the movie definitely made up for its one flaw. If you're a fan of war movies than you can't go wrong with Defiance. It's an excellent movie based on a true story with exceptional performances by it's three lead actors. Go see it. You can't go wrong with this film. It's entertaining and the movie tells an important story of survival against all odds that definitely deserves to be told.",8,2,5,6 June 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes An Entertaining Action Crime Adventure
","Sherlock Holmes is an entertaining action crime adventure from director Guy Ritchie whose admirable in making this movie. It has actually made me what to check out some of his other films like Snatch and Rock N Rolla to name a few. Sherlock Holmes has some tiny flaws that I'll get into later but the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as the character of the title. It's definitely a much different interpretation of the popular private sleuth detective than we've seen before. With Iron Man, Zodiac, The Soloist, and Tropic Thunder, Downey Jr. has made a great comeback proving to be one of Hollywoods most talented actors. He continues to solidify just that with his performance in this movie. Well done. Jude Law is equally impressive as Holmes partner and best friend Dr. John Watson. Downey Jr. and Law have genuine chemistry with each other perfecting an odd couple relationship between their characters. They make the best of the screen time together which provides the movie with a lot of humor. Rachel McAdams is good as Irene Adler the only woman to make as Watson puts it 'a proper idiot' out of Holmes 'twice.' Despite not being given a whole lot do, McAdams is convincing as the beautiful temptress Irene none the less. Mark Strong is solid as serial killer and mysterious occult 'sorcerer' Lord Blackwood in his limited screen time who proves to be an effective villain for Holmes. He doesn't share many scenes with Downey Jr. but the few they do have together are well written. The rest of the cast are nothing memorable but they do what their roles require and still turn in decent performances. The action sequences are well executed with just enough so it doesn't feel like overkill. There was a nice balance between the action, humor, and drama that made the 128 minute running time go by at a steady pace. The humor was very funny which always helps make a film better and we can thank most of it from the banter between Downey Jr. and Law. They both delivered their lines to perfection bringing much of the humor out of the script through their odd couple relationship. There were a few memorable quotes too that I found quite funny like 'Permission to enter the armory?', 'No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not', and 'So that's a no to the opera then?' to name a couple. Some of the action scenes were even humorous especially the one with Sherlock Holmes in a bare knuckles boxing match and another involving a huge French guy. I also liked how most of the films mysteries including Lord Blackwood's possible supernatural abilities were explained in a logical manner and it didn't leave you with many unanswered questions. The few minor flaws were that certain characters (Blackwood and Irene) weren't really developed considering most of the focus is on Downey and Law which isn't a bad thing. It just wouldn't be a little better if we knew more about Blackwood or Irene. The climatic fight between Holmes and Blackwood near the climax felt a bit rushed but hey that's okay because everything else made up for the films minor flaws. Overall I was still very impressed with Sherlock Holmes and I recommend this to anyone looking for a movie that sure to leave you feeling entertained by the end. Sherlock Holmes has a complex but not too complicated story with just enough action, humor, drama, and exceptional performances by the two leads (especially Downey Jr. and Law) who make this film worth the time to watch.",8,5,8,11 April 2010
WALL·E," Wall E A Much Better Than Expected Pixar Movie
","Wall E was a much better than expected pixar movie writer/director Andrew Stanton who has done a great job in making this movie about a lonely robot left on Earth to clean up the waste left by humans in the distant future. The cast of relatively unknowns proving their voices for the character except for Sigourney Weaver are excellent. At the heart of this film is a love story between Wall-E and a more advanced robot named Eve. The writers did a great job of fleshing out the character of Wall-E whose in it for the majority of the movie. You care about the lonely robot because all he wants more than anything is a friend. This movie has a little something in it for everyone humor, some action, drama, character development, and a touching love story. I was very impressed with this film and I can see why after seeing Wall-E why may critics and audiences mostly kids really liked this one. The film was a little slow in the beginning but the rest made up for it's one flaw. Overall Wall-E has humor, some action, great special effects, romance, and well developed characters you come to care about. So if you're looking for a good movie to watch with your kids. You can go wrong with this one. Much better than expected.",9,2,4,20 June 2009
The Blind Side," The Blind Side An Excellent Drama Based On A True Story
","The Blind Side is an excellent drama based on a true story with exceptional performances by the cast. This film is about Michael Oher a homeless teenager who went on to become a first round NFL draft pick of the Baltimore Ravens for left tackle in 2009. Writer/Director John Lee Hancock is admirable in bringing Michael's true story to the big screen that was much better than expected and it left me feeling entertained from beginning to end. It has a compelling coming of age story with a nice balance between drama and humor. Sandra Bullock turns in one of her best performances as Leigh Ann Tuohy and I for one believe she deserved the Oscar she won for the role. She's proved in every movie despite it's flaws her talent as an actress and this one is no different. Bullock plays Leigh Ann who through an act of kindness takes in a homeless teenage African-American, named Michael 'Big Mike' Oher played effectively by Quinton Aaron. I haven't seen him anything before but I thought Aaron was equally impressive as Michael a poor teenager looking for something he's never had before; a family. Bullock, Aaron, and the rest of the cast had nice chemistry with each other on screen making their growing friendships believable. Tim McGraw turned in a solid performance as Leigh's husband Sean who becomes a surrogate father to Michael. I haven't seen McGraw in too many movies either but he still gives a good performance none the less. The rest of the cast including Lily Collins as Leigh's daughter Collins, Ray McKinnon, and Kim Dickens are effective as the supporting characters. Jae Head as Leighs son S.J. was the stand out who like the rest of his family forms an unbreakable bond with Michael. Jae Head impressed me with his performance whether it was acting like a drill sergeant while training Michael or demanding full access to him while he's in college. He provides the film with some great comic relief and his dialog delivery makes it that much funnier. He also had genuine chemistry with Aaron (Bullock, McGraw, and Collins) in their scenes together. Well done. Kathy Bates shows up in a small role as Mike's tutor Miss Sue and she does what her brief part requires. I heard this film was good but it surpassed by expectations. Besides some characters who aren't really developed (Bates) and a few predictable moments. Overall the good more than outweighed the bad because I enjoyed The Blind Side. I became invested in the main characters and the story which made the 128 minutes running time move at a steady pace. The moments of humor are executed perfectly mostly from Jae Head's great comic timing. I'll admit I wasn't expecting much but after watching this I can see why many people including critics liked it. If you're in the mood for an inspirational true to life story with drama, humor, and solid performances by the cast (Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron, and especially Jae Head), you can't go wrong with the Blind Side. It has everything you could ever want and expect from one of this films. Give the Blind Side a chance. It was much better than anticipated.",9,1,3,26 May 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," The Shawshank Redemption Is An Excellent Film
","The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent film from director Frank Darabont whose admirable in making this story based on a book by Stephen King. Tim Robbins gives a great performance as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman is equally impressive as Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding two imprisoned men looking for redemption who bond after many years while dealing with not only the abusive corrupt prison guards but the violent fellow prisoners amongst them as well. Robbins and Freeman had good chemistry together which made their growing friendship that much more believable on the screen. The rest of the cast including Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The pacing was a little slow at times and the running time of 142 minutes made the film feel a bit long but the rest made up for it's few flaws. Overall despite it's flaws The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a must see a movie that can't be missed. It has a compelling story, character development, drama, some humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (especially Robbins and Freeman) who make this one of the best books by Stephen King that was made into a movie. Well done. Much better than expected.",9,2,3,22 June 2009
Scream," Scream A Thrilling Horror Film With A Few Flaws
","Scream is a thrilling horror film with a few flaws but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Filmmaker Wes Craven continues to show his skill with Scream giving audiences a horror film that delivers on what fans expect from the genre bloody deaths, a scary villain, and some suspense that doesn't quite pay off entirely but it's still worth seeing at least once. The cast of relative unknown actors at the time including Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and Skeet Ulrich are admirable in their roles. David Arquette (Courtney Cox's future husband), Matthew Lillard, and Rose McGowan turn in decent supporting performances but they aren't given much screen time. Drew Barry makes a brief appearance and then is written out of the movie rather quickly. The rest of the cast including Jamie Kennedy, W. Earl Brown, and Liev Shreiber in a brief cameo make the best of their small parts in the movie. There are surprises in the movie one I sort of saw coming and the other I didn't about the identity of the killer(s)were satisfying but once they're revealed there's no more real suspense. With it's flaws aside Scream is still an entertaining horror movie that has just the right amount of gruesome deaths, anticipation, and some suspense that makes it worth the time to watch.",8,1,2,8 June 2009
Iron Man," Iron Man An Entertaining Comic Book Movie
","When I went to see Iron Man I wasn't expecting much but this film surpassed my expectations thanks to a knock out the park performance by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. In tradition of 'Batman Begins' this movie tells the story of how billionaire industrialist and genius inventor Tony Stark becomes the high tech armored superhero Iron Man. Downey Jr. delivers a great performance and he owns the role from his very first scene just as Christian Bale did as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Begins and the late Heath Ledger did as Batman's arch nemesis the Joker in the sequel The Dark Knight. He's perfect for the role of Stark making you believe a man like him could really exist. The rest of the cast also turn in terrific performances including Terrence Howard as Tony's best friend Colonel James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane and later Iron's Man nemesis known as Iron Monger, and Gwenyth Paltrow as Tony's loyal assistant Pepper Potts. The film may be a bit light on action but what it does have is character development plus lots of humor, drama, some suspense, and thrills. The action sequences are well choreographed and most of them happen toward the second half of the film. The special effects are fantastic especially when Tony puts on the suit and becomes Iron Man. Jon Favreau the director and actor did a great job of bringing the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man to the big screen. The battle between Iron Man and Iron Monger at the end did feel a bit anti-climatic and a bit rushed but fortunately the good more than outweighs the films tiny flaws. Because other then that Iron Man was definitely much better than I thought it would be and now I'm looking forward to see what they have in stored for the sequel. If you haven't seen Iron Man yet then go see it. You'll be glad you did.",9,2,4,9 May 2009
Casino Royale," Casin Royale A Worthy Addition To The Series
","Casino Royale is a worthy addition to the series there are a few flaws but it's still an entertaining action adventure. The film tells the story of Bonds early years when he's promoted to 00 status. Daniel Craig has the difficult task of playing the iconic British spy James Bond coming in after Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and most recently Pierce Bronsan who have also played the character. Craig is great in the role and completely believable as Bond the British spy who is willing to kill in order to protect his country. The supporting cast overall turn in solid performances including Eva Green as Vesper Lynd a potential love interest for Bond, Mads Mikkelsen as the villain corrupt banker Le Chiffre, and Giancarlo Giannini as fellow agent Mathis. Jeffrey Wright as CIA Agent Felix Leiter and Judi Dench as M make the best of their small roles in the film who are Bond's allies in his quest to stop Le Chiffre. The rest of the cast also turn in good performances. The action which can get over the top sometimes is exhilarating and everything else in the film works. One of the movies flaws is the the running time of 144 minutes did make it feel sort of long and the pace was slow at times. Another one was the lack of a real bad ass villain (which some recent films also lacked). I mean Mikkelsen does what he can with Le Chiffree but his character isn't that menacing or scary (like most recently the late Heath Ledger's Joker or Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lecter to name a few). He seemed like an average villain and not much of a threat to Bond. But other than that it's still a good action movie with equally impressive performances by it's cast. Well done.",8,3,5,18 May 2009
X2: X-Men United," X-Men United A Much Better Sequel With Some Flaws
","I thought this one of those rare sequels that was actually much better improvement over the first one but there were some flaws. The film is no Dark Knight or Spider-man 2 but I'd say that it's just as good as either Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk. Bryan Singer does an admirable job with this sequel giving the audiences some more interesting characters (but it can feel a bit much at times) and just enough exhilarating sci-fi action. Singer improves on some of the flaws in the first one but some are still in the sequel but the good outweighs the bad. The cast are great in their roles including Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine, Ian McKellen as Eric Lesherr/Magento, Halle Berry as Ororo Munroe/Storm, Famke Janssen as Jean Grey (Phoenix), James Marsden as Scott Summers/Cyclops, Rebecca Romijin Stamos as Mystique, and Anna Paquin Marie D'Ancanto/Rogue. Joining the cast are Brian Cox as one of the villains Colonel William Striker, Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike, and Alan Cumming as Kurt Warner/Nightcrawler. The rest of the supporting cast are good in their roles but unfortunately they don't get a lot of screen time and aren't developed either. Magneto, Mystique, Striker, and Deathstrike prove to be effective villains. But how many villains can you have in one movie? Other than Deathstrike not being in it much and having almost no dialogue. The actors and actresses bring a lot to their roles no matter how big or small it may be. On the side of good Wolverine, Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler prove to be believable heroes in the imaginary world they inhabit where mutants and humans are trying to co-exist. Some of the flaws in the last film are in this one as well like the fact that they still seem to be juggling too many characters (Colossus, Jubilee, and Kitty Pride have nothing more than brief cameos). Patrick Stewarts Charles Xavier and James Marsden's Cyclops also seemed to have less screen time than they did in the first film as well. Cyclops disappears for a large parts of the movie (like Xavier) only to show up near the end. The other supporting characters including Iceman and Pyro have bigger roles that some of the others but they still lack screen time. Bruce Davison also returns for a brief blink and you missed it appearance as Senator Kelly from the first film (He's actually Mystique because his character died in the first X-Men). With it's flaws aside X-Men United is still definitely a much better improvement over it's predecessor and is an entertaining comic book brought to the big screen. From it's incredible opening sequence involving a teleporting Nightcrawler to it's emotional climax involving the possible death of a major character X-Men United has plenty action, suspense, thrills, drama, and some humor that make for an enjoyable film to watch.",8,1,2,19 May 2009
The Sixth Sense," The Sixth Sense An Effective Thriller With A Good Twist Ending
","The Sixth Sense is an effective thriller with a good twist ending from director M Night Shyamalan whose admirable in making this movie which was his first back in 1999. His other films that followed haven't even been on par with this one but thats okay. The cast are good in their roles including Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, and especially Haley Joel Osment as the boy who can see dead people. The rest of the cast are okay in their limited screen time. Its best to see this without knowing too much about the film because that will ruin some of the surprises including a revelation about one of the main characters. This film does have a little suspense and creepy moments but there could have been more of them. This film felt a bit like a drama with thriller and supernatural elements which wasn't a bad thing. The music by James Newton Howard seems to sync very well with the tone of the film and what was happening on the screen. The creepy moments usually involving a dead person being seen are well executed and paced. This is a movie you'll want to see twice so you can pick up on things you didn't notice before the first time around. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws. Overall The Sixth Sense is a solid thriller with some suspense, creepy moments, drama, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.",8,3,4,22 June 2009
Final Destination," Final Destination A Decent Creepy Thriller
","Final Destination is a decent horror thriller from writer/director James Wong. The cast of young stars are admirable in their roles including Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Sean William Scott, and Tony Todd in a brief cameo appearance as an exceptionally creepy mortician. The rest of the cast also turned in good performances. This is one of the few horror/thrillers that I was very impressed with. For those of you who haven't seen it I won't say anything about it except that it's an above average horror thriller with some flaws in dialogue and some unanswered questions but the good outweighs the bad. If you're a fan of these movies than you'll enjoy this one too. With just the right amount of intense inventive deaths, an interesting premise, solid acting for the most part, suspense, and some thrills Final Destination is an entertaining horror movie to watch.",7,1,1,6 June 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Nightmare On Elm Street Okay But Not Spectacular
","A Nightmare on elm street was okay but nothing spectacular. The movie is creepy with a little suspense but once you've seen one person get killed in a gruesome way you've seen them all. Writer/Director Wes Craven is admirable in making this horror movie about a dead child murderer who comes back for revenge by stalking people mostly teenagers in their dreams. Craven has shown his talent in all of his films and this is no different. Robert Englund is admirable as Freddy Kruger as the dead burned child murderer giving audiences a villain who is creepy and scary but the inevitable sequels that followed after just got old because it was the same plot all over again with his character stalking teenagers in their dreams. Englund is still effective as Freddy none the less. The rest of the cast are good including John Saxon, Ronee Blakley, Heather Langenkamp, and a young Johnny Depp in a small part but his role unfortunately gets cut short. The bloody deaths committed by Freddy are well executed but after a while they get kind of old. The lack of real scares, suspense build up which there was some but not a lot, and the dialogue at times is what weighed the movie down the much at least to me. Overall though A Nightmare On Elm Street is an okay horror thriller with some suspense and decent performances that make for a creepy but flawed film to watch.",6,4,7,14 June 2009
The Matrix," The Matrix An Excellent Sci-Fi Adventure With Great Action
","The Matrix is an excellent sci-fi adventure with great action from the Wachowski brothers who are admirable in making this movie about a computer hacker who discovers that the world and the life he's been living is an illusion. A computer generated dream world that was created a long time ago to keep the humans in a prison from which only a few can escape who are brave enough to fight the deadly machines that have taken over the real world. I preferred this one over the two disappointing sequels that followed. Reoladed was okay but could've been better and Revolutions was the worst of the trilogy mainly because the story lost focus on the main characters, the finale felt rushed, and the ending that does leave the door open for another possible sequel was a major letdown. The Matrix however is one of the best sci-fi films out there because of the compelling story, complex characters, a menacing villain, some humor, a little romance, and with just enough intense action. Keanu Reeves stars as Neo the computer hacker who discovers he has a greater destiny than he could have ever imagine. He is the chosen One a man gifted with amazing abilities who may be the only one powerful enough to stop the machines and free his people. Reeves makes for a solid hero who may not win any awards for his performance but he still does a good job in the role. The same can go for Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus a man who believes in The One and wants to free Neo in order to show him the truth about their world. Fishburne is convincing as Morpheus and his fight sequences are impressive especially his sparring match with Reeves. Carrie Anne Moss is believable as the tough freedom fighter Trinity who begins to grow feelings for Neo but she doesn't want to admit it. Moss also does a great job in her fight sequences portraying a woman you definitely wouldn't want to mess with. Hugo Weaving is an imposing villain as Agent Smith a sentinel program who makes it his mission to stop Neo from fulfilling his destiny. Weaving chews the scenery with menace and does a terrific job with his part in the movie. The rest of the supporting cast are admirable in their roles but none of them really stand out. The action/fight sequences are well executed the ones that left an impression being the first one that opens the movie, the sparring match with Reeves and Fishburne, the lobby shootout, and the fierce showdown between Neo and Agent Smith in a subway. The special effects to create the machines and the ruins of the real world where the machines have taken over which is shown a few times are magnificently done. Also worth mentioning is the music by Don Davis which seems to match perfect whats happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The pacing of the movie was a little slow but once the action kicks into high gear it moves at a steady pace from there. The movie does leave a lot of questions unanswered but other than those few flaws this is still an amazing sci-film that definitely impressed me when I first saw it. So overall The Matrix is a great experience with the state of the art special effects, a compelling story, intense action, suspense, some humor, a little romance, and impressive performances by the cast who make this an enjoyable sci-fi movie to watch.",9,1,2,11 June 2009
Godzilla," Godzilla is back and better than ever
","Godzilla is back and better than ever. Director Gareth Edwards does a great job of bring this movie to life despite some flaws which I'll get into later. The cast did a good job with what they were given. Aaron Taylor Johnson wasn't as bad as I think some critics made him out to be. His performance isn't Oscar worthy but he's alright as the main character Ford Brody. Ken Wanatabe, Elisabeth Olsen, David Straithan, Juliette Binoche, and Bryan Cranston were believable as their characters. Cranston and Binoche roles however are cut rather short. The special effects are incredible. Godzilla himself and the MUTO's felt very real for a film about giant prehistoric creatures that thrived during a time when the Earth was highly radioactive. I think Godzilla was in it just enough. I'd say he gets maybe 20-25 minutes of screen time mostly during the 2nd half and the climax. The build up to Godzilla's appearance was effective and his atomic fire breath is awesome. So was his roar. He makes his first appearance about 45-50 mins into it. I liked the glimpses we got of him before the full reveal at the Hawaii airport scene. Godzilla's look closely resembled his original one with some differences. The Kaiju fights between him and the MUTO's were cool although there could've been a little more of them. Their fierce final showdown at the end was worth the wait. Some of the characters weren't really developed but it's just a minor criticism. There's action scenes throughout to keep you on the edge and entertained. Overall I really enjoyed it a lot more than the Amazing Spider-man 2 so far this year. I recommend it to any looking for a good monster movie to watch that delivers.",8,2,4,25 May 2014
Heat," Heat An Entertaining Crime Action Thriller With Some Flaws
","Heat is an entertaining action crime thriller with some flaws by director Michael Mann the man behind films like Collateral, Miami Vice, and the upcoming Public Enemies who does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen. The star studded cast are terrific in their roles including Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, and Jon Voight. The rest of supporting cast are good in their small roles but aren't given much to do. The movie is a bit long with a running time of almost three hours and it could've been much shorter. The pacing was kind of slow at times too but everything else more than made up for it's few flaws. The opening heist sequence is well done and the same can go for the intense shoot out in the streets of Los Angeles. Pacino makes for an effective hero on the side of good and De Niro is equally impressive as the villain. They both prove to be worth adversaries but unfortunately they're not given much screen time together or confrontations for that matter. With it's flaws aide however Heat overall is still an enjoyable movie to watch because of the story, the action, suspense, and most of all the exceptional performances by it's lead actors.",8,1,3,7 June 2009
300," 300 A Decent Retelling of the Battle At Thermopylae
","This movie is a decent retelling of the battle at Thermopylae in 480 B.C. where King Leonidas and a force of 300 men fought a massive army of Persians in order to protect Greece. Director Zack Snyder for the most part gives audiences what they expect after seeing the trailer to this despite some flaws with character development and a somewhat slow beginning before the action kicks into high gear. 300 has just enough blood, brutal deaths, limps being chopped off like butter, and impressive special effects including legendary creatures and landscapes with a thunderous score by Tyler Bates which seems to fit the tone of the film. The cast are good in their roles including Gerard Butler who brings an intensity to his performance as King Leonidas, Leana Headey as his tough feisty wife Queen Gorgo, David Wenham as one of Leonidas' brave soldiers Dilios, and Dominic West as the devious corrupt traitor Theron. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles as well. The action which does really start to kick in until about 35-40 mins into the movie except for one or two brief action sequences in the beginning are well executed none the less. The special effects are definitely the highlight of the film and it helps bring to life this story about the 300 Spartans who sacrificed their lives for Greece. This movie seems to be told from the Spartans point of view because some of the creatures are a bit unrealistic but it worked adding some supernatural elements to the story that really did happen a long time ago. The slow-mo sex scene between Butler and Heady was steamy but it did feel a bit unnecessary but as a guy I'm not complaining that much. So overall despite some flaws 300 is a decent action adventure that delivers for the most part. If you're a fan of these type of movies than chances are you'll enjoy this one as well.",7,0,0,27 June 2009
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Four An Okay Comic Book Movie But Flawed
","Fantastic Four is another movie based on a comic book that's okay but it's not the greatest either. Director Tim Story does an all right job of bringing this film to the big screen but it's definitely no Batman Begins or Iron Man to name a few. Ian Grufford is good as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic but unfortunately he isn't given much to do and his powers aren't that great at least to me compared to Johnny's or even Dr. Dooms. Jessica Alba is admirable and does a solid job in her role as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Chris Evans stands out amongst them playing Sue's daredevil brother Johnny Storm/The Human Torch. The same can go for Michael Chiklis as Reed's best friend Ben Grimm/The Thing. I would have given this film a much lower rating if it wasn't for them but even they can't help this movie as a whole. Julian McMahon is equally impressive as Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom but his fight with the Fantastic Four at the end doesn't last long and it ends up being a major letdown. Kerry Washington does what she can in a very brief cameo appearance as Alicia a possible love interest for Ben but her role seems entirely wasted. No offense. The rest of the cast turn in average performances but none of them stood out besides Evans and Chiklis. The special effects to create their various powers were cool but it wasn't anything we haven't seen before and the movie didn't bring anything really new to the genre. The few action sequences in the movie are well executed but they failed to leave an impression even the showdown at the end between Doom and the Fantastic Four. The dialogue isn't the greatest at times either. Overall though Fantastic Four is a decent movie worth seeing once or twice with some action, character development, some humor, and a little romance that make for a somewhat enjoyable movie to watch if you can get past it's flaws first.",5,2,3,6 June 2009
Pineapple Express," Pineapple Express A Funny Stoner Comedy
","Pineapple Express is a funny stoner comedy with plenty of laughs thanks to the admirable performances of Seth Rogen (from Knocked Up and Superbad) and especially James Franco (from Spider-man and Flyboys). For those of you who haven't seen it yet I won't say anything else about the movie except that I was impressed with Pineapple Express. I thought I wasn't going to like it but I thought it was a well made stoner buddy action comedy. It may not be no masterpiece but the movie does offer plenty of laughs with some action and chases thrown in for guilty pleasure. The scenes with Rogen and Franco together provide much of the comic relief as their two characters find themselves in one hilarious situation after another while trying to avoid a dangerous drug dealer. No offense to Franco who I think is a good actor like Rogen. Some of his films may not have been that great but I never thought Franco could be some funny. Major props to him for playing Saul Silver who is one hilarious stoner/dealer. Well done. Rogen is funny too but Franco was a big surprise considering some of the movies he's been in like Spider-man, Flyboys, and the Great Raid to name few. The rest of the supporting cast turn in solid performances including Gary Cole, Danny McBride, Rosie Perez, Kevin Corrigan, and Amber Heard. The action in the movie can go over the top occasionally but is pretty well choreographed. The chase scene involving Rogen and Franco in a police car is hilarious. The strong language can be a bit much at times but overall Pineapple Express is a funny stoner comedy with some action thrown in that make for a good film to watch. If you're a fan of the genre or any of the actors then chances are you'll enjoy Pinapple Express. Better than expected.",8,4,9,1 June 2009
Sin City," Sin City A Solid Movie From A Graphic Novel
","Sin City is a solid movie from a graphic novel brought to the big screen by Robert Rodriguez. A great cast of talented actors help bring this movie to the big screen. Most of their screen time maybe limited but they make the best of their roles. The movie is set in a city overrun by corruption where the ladies are just as dangerous as the men. The cast is full of great talent for the most part. Jessica Alba is okay as Nancy a stripper but her character isn't memorable like some others. Devon Aoki does a good job in a role with no dialogue as one of the prostitutes of Olde Town. Alexis Bledel is decent as Becky another one girl from Olde Town who ends up being a backstabber. Rosario Dawson is convincing as Gail the leader of the Olde Town girls in her short screen time. Benicio Del Toro makes the best of his brief villain role as Jackie Boy a cop with penchant for violence but his part is cut short. The two actors to stand out are Clive Owen as Dwight a murderer with a new face who tries to stop Jackie Boy and Mickey Rourke as Marv a thug after the one responsible for killing his love Goldie. They both leave an impression even with their short screen time and are the best characters in the movie. Rourke's Marv provides some much needed dark comic relief to the film and Owen brings an intensity to his character Dwight. Well done. Bruce Willis shows up early on and then disappears for most of the movie only to show up near the end again but he makes the best of his smart part to play in the movie as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Jamie King, Josh Hartnett, Carla Gugino, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, and Elijah Wood in a non-speaking role as one of the villains do what they can in their brief cameos but aren't developed enough for you to care about them or understand the reasons behind their actions. The pacing was a little slow and the voice overs done by the characters was a bit much at times but the good outweighs the bad. Overall Sin City is an entertaining graphic novel turned into movie using state of the art special effects that is obviously CGI but it fits the tone of the film. What really makes this movie work is the talented all star cast who help bring these imaginary characters from the graphic novels by Frank Miller to life. Sin City is sure to please any fan of Miller, Rodriguez, or graphic novels whose looking for a good movie to watch with equally impressive performances by most of the cast.",8,2,4,8 June 2009
Gangs of New York," Gangs Of New York A Solid Action Crime Drama
","Gangs Of New York is a solid action crime drama from director Martin Scorcese who continues to show his skill as a filmmaker with this film. The cast are admirable in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day Lewis, and Cameron Diaz. DiCaprio is great as Amsterdam Vallon a man seeking revenge against the one who killed his father. DiCaprio may not have the flashier role like Day Lewis but he's still believable as the hero bringing that intensity he's been know for to the character. Daniel Day Lewis gives a knock out performance as Billy 'The Butcher' Cutting a psychotic gangland kingpin who killed Amsterdams father. Day Lewis is terrific in the role of a man whose willing to kill anyone without hesitation. The people are either with him or against him there is no middle ground. Cameron Diaz is good as Jenny Everdeane a woman willing to do almost anything to survive and a potential love interest for DiCaprio's Amsterdam. John C Reilly, Jim Broadbent, Bredan Gleason, Henry Thomas, and a brief appearance by Liam Neeson are effective as the supporting characters but most of them don't have much to do and aren't in it much either. All of them still turn in solid performances none the less in their limited screen time. Most of the movie takes place in New York during 1863 when one of the worst riots in American history took place. The fact that this really did happen gave the movie a realistic fool especially the location where they chose to have this film take place giving audiences a look at what it could've been like back then in New York. The action sequences which mostly involve people getting beat up in brutal ways are well executed especially the riots at the end. The showdown between Amsertdam and Bill was a bit of a letdown but it was fitting for the movie. The film was a bit long with a running time of 167 minutes. The pacing was a little slow at times but the performances by the cast make it worth watching anyway. Despite some flaws Gangs Of New York is still a well made crime drama with enough action, some suspense, a little humor and romance. So if you can get past the long running time Gangs Of New York is definitely worth watching and most of that besides what I already mentioned is because of the exceptional performances (especially Day Lewis and DiCaprio) by the lead actors and the amazing talent of Scorcese who continues to prove himself as a gifted filmmaker with this movie. Well done.",8,8,10,17 June 2009
Moon," Moon Is An Impressive Sci-Fi Drama
","Moon is an impressive sci-fi drama with thriller elements from writer/director Duncan Jones whose admirable in making this movie that has a compelling story and equally impressive special effects which help bring the film to life. Sam Rockwell is very effective as the lead. He's the only major character and Rockwell carries the movie well. Sam continues to show his talent as an actor with this one. Kevin Spacey provides his voice for Sam's loyal robot Gert. The rest of the cast including the actress who played Sam's wife are okay in their cameo roles. Moon impressed me with how good this movie was and how the special effects really helped make you feel the isolation of being alone on the moon. With a running time of 97 minutes the film moves at a steady pace so it doesn't drag on forever. The character Sam plays in the movie is well developed because you care about him and his struggle. There are a few twists one of them is revealed a little early but it worked none the less. Overall this film was better then I thought it would be and it's sure to please any die hard science fiction fan. Moon has character development, drama, a little humor, and an exceptional performance by Sam Rockwell who makes it worth the time to watch.",8,1,3,19 January 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," The Pursuit Of Happiness Much Better Than Expected
","The Pursuit Of Happiness was much better than expected mainly because of the great performance by Will Smith who continues to show his talent as an actor in this film. Director Gabriele Muccino has done an admirable job of making this movie based on an inspiring true story about a struggling salesman who tries to find a steady job so that he can support him and his son after losing nearly everything but finds a chance to get his life back on track with a stockbroker internship at Dean Witter. Will Smith is fantastic as Chris Gardner the struggling salesman giving one of his best performances in this film. Smith continues to show why he's one of Hollywoods best actors today in this one. Well done. Will's real life son Jaden steps into the role of his on screen son Chris Jr. and he is equally impressive. They both have great chemistry together and because they are rally father and son they didn't have to try hard to make that believable in the movie. The rest of the cast are good in their roles. Thandie Newton makes a brief extended appearance as Chris' wife who leaves him. Newton may lack screen time but she's still effective in the role. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but it does offer some humor, drama, and a touching story about the bond between a father and his son which makes up for it's one flaw. Overall The Pursuite Of Happiness was much better than I thought it would be. The movie has drama, some small doses of humor, characters we come to care about, and terrific performances by the cast especially Will Smith who makes this inspiring true story enjoyable to watch.",8,2,3,12 June 2009
The Bourne Supremacy," The Bourne Supremacy A Worthy Sequel
","The Bourne Supremacy is a worthy sequel from director Paul Greengrass whose admirable in making this giving audiences what they expect from one of these movies. Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne and he continues to be the perfect choice for the role. Frank Potente also reprises her role as Bournes love Marie from the first film but her part in this one unfortunately is cut really short. The rest of the cast including Brian Cox, Gabriel Mann, Karl Urban, Julia Stiles, and Joan Allen are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The rest of the cast are good in their roles as well. The action/fight sequences and chases are well executed even though some of them can be a bit of a stretch. The movie had a steady pace mainly because of the action and the ending was fitting. Despite some flaws with character development and the lack of a more central villain, The Bourne Supremacy is definitely one of the better sequels out there. Overall this movie had just enough intense action, fist fights, chases, suspense, thrills, and exceptional performances by the cast especially Damon who makes this sequel worth the time to watch.",8,3,4,19 June 2009
Cinderella Man," Cinderella Man An Excellent Movie Based On A True Story
","Cinderella Man is an excellent movie based on a true story with equally impressive performances by Russell Crowe, Renee Zellwegger, and Paul Giamatti. Director Ron Howard is admirable in making this movie continuing to show his talent as filmmaker despite it's flaws. Howard has shown again and again his skill as a director and this film is no different. Russell Crowe turns in a great as Jim Braddock a supposedly washed up boxer who came back to become a champion and an inspiration in the 1930s. Renee Zellwegger is just as good as his wife Mae but she isn't given much to do. Zellwegger is solid in the role none the less. Paul Giamatti is equally impressive as Braddock's manager and best friend Joe Gould. The rest of the cast including Craig Bierko, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill, and Rosemarie DeWitt are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The intense boxing sequences are well executed and you find yourself cheering for Crowe's character whenever he steps into that ring. The pacing was slow at times but the effort put in by the director and the lead actors make up for the films few flaws. If you're a big fan of Howard or any of the actors than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. Overall Cinderella Man was better than expected with an inspiring true story, characters we come to care about, drama, intense realistic boxing action, and exceptional performances by the cast (especially Crowe and Giamatti) who make this movie worth the time to watch.",8,1,1,28 June 2009
The Island," The Island A Decent Sc-Fi Film But Overlong
","The Island is a decent sci-film but overlong from director Michael Bay who seems to have a hate/love relationship with critics and audiences. I think he's a talented filmmaker some of his past films may not have been the greatest but he does show a lot skill in all of them none the less including this one. The cast for the most part are admirable in their roles including Ewan McGregor, Scarlet Johannson, Dijmin Honsou, and Sean Bean. McGregor and Johannson are effective as the leads bringing credibility to the characters and their situation. Honsou and Bean make for solid bad guys. They may lack development and screen time but both of them make the best of their roles as the villains. Steve Buscemi shows up for a brief role and does add some comic relief to the film but his part is cut rather short. The same can go for Michael Clarke Duncan makes a cameo appearance and then disappears for the rest of the film but he still does an okay job with his small part. The rest of the cast are good in their limited screen time but aren't really developed. The action sequences are well executed and intense most of them happening toward the second half but some aren't very realistic while others are missing that WOW factor that you get occasionally when watching these kind of films. Besides the cool special effects the movie does have plenty of humor that balances well between the action, drama, and suspense. The film was a little slow especially in the beginning before the action really starts to kick in and it felt a bit overlong but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Despite it's few problems The Island is still an entertaining sci-fi adventure that may be a bit long but it keeps your attention because of the intense action, suspense, and equally impressive performances by most of the cast who make the movie worth watching at least once.",7,3,5,11 June 2009
