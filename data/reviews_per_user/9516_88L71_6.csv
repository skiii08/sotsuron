Alien 3," What's wrong with it?
","***Warning: bit of spoiler, for 'Aliens' too***I think this movie is severely underrated, probably due to the delusion of some guys which expected a sequel for Aliens, with lotsa action and Michael Bienh in the part of the hero. First of all let me say the presence of an egg in the Sulaco was not so inexplicable, in Aliens Ripley bothered the Queen while she was spawning, don't you remember the forcible snatch of the tube when she started following Newt and Ripley? She could have left an egg in the ship before coming out and engaging Ripley. Now our fearless and cute Lieutenant is the only survivor, once again, that's a kind of malediction but not so unbelievable, her death is after all a matter of hours. Besides, I liked it cause it has something different with the first two, a new kind of suspense and interesting characters, an use of dull colors and cold lights (but only in the beginning) that is not so bad as someone says, and a more human and vulnerable Ripley that makes love and could be eliminated by the alien at their first meeting, when in the infirmary she's put on the corner but not killed cause of the queen she's carrying in her chest. Above all, i appreciated the bad end as symbolizing an over-tired Ripley giving up in front of her 2 worst nightmares: the aliens and the Company; i know it's just a personal point of view but i love tragic ends and this movie gives me the impression of being an 'end' in its entireness, the bitter end of the saga, told in a suitable way; you can dislike it but you can't say it doesn't fit with the first two. In my opinion it deserves a 7,5, that's not available, so i gave it 8, to compensate the current low average rating.",7,0,2,6 September 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Alien: Burial
","When i first heard a 4th was going to come out i was in the same state of mind of when in my car i encounter a long and slow column and i realize by the mess and the winking lights that a terrible accident happened, i know it won't be nice but i'm impatient to see it and when finally i pass i can't avoid to slow and take a look like everybody else, and more the scene is horrible more fascinated i am (better to say 'we are'). Well, 'Alien: resurrection' is indeed a terrible accident, what else to say? It's just a commercial move and Aliens saga fans must face it.This was predictable though, Alien3 was maybe weak and lame but got kinda syntony with the first two. J.P. Jeunet (or maybe J. Whedon) had the stimulant possibility of make those limy monsters finally land on earth but he probably thought it was too exacting and preferred the overworked story of infested ship... Anyway, he tried to invent something new in order to continue the tradition of renewal of the first 3 movies, Alien was a horror sci-fi, Aliens was an action sci-fi, Alien3 was a thriller sci-fi and now we have this comic-strip sci-fi that definitely cuts a bad figure compared to his predecessors... well, now i wonder what a 5th chapter could be and, unwillingly, i hope it won't be if these are the results...",3,0,0,28 August 2001
Armageddon," No, disconnecting brain is not enough
","* little a bit of a spoiler... but i'd wonder if you can't guess how this movie ends * Someone in here suggested just to send brain on vacation and enjoy the film... ok, this could be a good trick for most of the disaster and action movies out there, but IMO it just can't work for Armageddon. I mean, we can avoid to care about the macroscopic goofs of the plot... that asteroid, first of all, is not an asteroid but a planet, it's just weird to think we cannot see an object of such dimensions if not 18 days before it crashes on earth, and how the heck could you break it in two parts just putting a bomb 800 ft underground?? If it really has the dimensions of Texas it must have a diameter of several hundreds of Km, no matter how flat it is, the smaller diameter must be at least about 150 Km, what can a bomb do at 800 ft??? Just a crater, that is, and anyway a complicate mathematic calculus and precise estimations should establish the exact place where to drill and put the bomb, not just 'land somewhere where the ground is softer and do your work', and if the 'asteroid' takes a rotatory movement because of the moon gravity effect you can't just keep the old plan 'cause there's a precise moment in which to detonate the bomb, or one of the two fragments could keep running towards the earth... and so on... But as I said, who cares about that, the real problem here is that everything is too manifestly predictable... you just need to know what the movie is about and you'll know what will happen... ok, maybe you can't know exactly who'll die and who'll live, and who'll be the hero (but you can guess), but nothing, really NOTHING, can surprise you, even just a little, along this story. Deep Impact has something more to say, and without being a masterwork it is just a bit more interesting, at least it does not just focalize on the mission.",3,0,2,10 September 2002
Schindler's List," touching fairy tale
","This is a good movie indeed, one of those which make you think. The simple fact of being a Spielberg film warned me not to take it too seriously, after all he's always that dream embodier we all knew in his classics... touching little aliens, dire tough sharks, smart dinosaurs brought back to life and so on. Even here we have a stunning portrait of the evil (R.Fiennes really deserved the oscar he didn't get) but the real Amon Goeth had not a home on a hill as we can see, and he was arrested in September 44 by SS, then captured by americans and executed on Sept 46. All in this movie is clearly intended to make you feel dizzy and touched, this is of course not shifty, everyone knows this is a tear-jerker but what everyone seems to ignore is that you need some subterfuges when you aim to involve deeply someone in a story, and Spielberg knows how to do it, he knows it well, he is a master. So, here are the expected germans, shown as either monsters or homicidal robots; a bunch of events of which only the grotesque aspect is fully portrayed and most of all a movie that openly focalize only on jews, giving the impression (the same we get at school) that they are the greatest (or more important) victims of that period, think about people of the former USSR before answering 'well...isn't it?'. I said it makes you think, personally i had to think when i saw all the comments here in the IMDb about this film, seems people simply accept it without any reservation and with tears in their eyes... the power of being Steven Spielberg! And, most of all, the power of talking about Holocaust! I'm not a negationist, even though i don't accept blindly the classic version of history, and i'm definitely not a nazi-sympathizing, but i don't like hypocrisy and all forms of mass-conditioning, 'books say...' 'Spielberg says...' and everytime an hysterical and irrational commotion. That was a complicate period, you can't understand it reading a single book or watching a movie, anyway, everyone plays the wiseacre and gives his sentence. After all, i give a good 9/10 for film making, good acting, good directing, good soundtrack, good all; and 5/10 for pretentious politically correct intentions, a nice arithmetical 7/10 and life goes on.",7,1,3,10 September 2001
The Matrix," A sensible guy (Agent Smith) vs. a haughty and selfish one (Neo)... I let you guess who could win in this lame world...
","While watching this movie the audience is supposed to join the position of Neo, the freedom fighter, the elected, the one, the saviour of human kind blablabla and his nice company... but, I mean, how the heck can you disagree with Agent Smith when he says: -- ' [...] Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area, and you multiply, and multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague [...] ' --Ok, you can be the typical egoistic/egocentric/selfish type of guy who thinks that humans have the right of exploiting everything just 'cause they can do it, but still you must admit that the (supposedly) bad-guy of the movie is speaking the truth there.Then again he says: -- 'Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization.' --I found myself smiling at this, have you ever noticed the way some ppl without any apparent reason to be unhappy invent some problems they actually have not, create some paranoia or exaggerate little things just to waste their time in troubles? Ha!Ha! More than once I heard somebody saying the world would be a boredom if everything was right, no thrill, no revolutionary ideals to spread, no fights, no enemies to crush... I see Agent Smith is right once again, human beings find their way to progress by taking how more distance is possible from nature, and sophisticating their tastes and needs, that's why the best Matrix is just a copy of one of ours (supposedly) more evolved civilizations, with all its faults.I couldn't avoid to sympathize with Agent Smith, also because NEO is definitely an unpleasant character with all his self-complacency, haughtiness and conceit, urged and encouraged to this by his similarly unpleasant company. Are you thinking machines here are blameworthy for the way they use humans? At least they induce us in a realistic dream of a real life, we don't do the same with all the animals we grow jailed, we puff-up and then we slaughter for our pleasure. (PLEASURE, not survival, 'cause we don't need to eat meat to live, we just do it because we like it).So, IMO this movie has a pretty stimulating plot filled with annoying Hollywood-type exaggerate action... all in all I rate it a 6½ out of 10, 'cause it's entertaining and offers some cues for a reflection.",Null,1,2,24 September 2002
Evil Dead II," If you expect a horror, you're likely to be disappointed, and if you expect a comedy too... but...
","There are very mixed opinions about this movie I see, some trash it cos it's not a real horror, others say (well, 'write' actually) the jokes are pretty weak (and not even real jokes, after all) and so it does not even work as a comedy. Many others, on the contrary, are enthusiastic about it. Well, IMHO, the deal here is just to understand what this stuff really is, and if I had to describe it in one word I'd say it is 'grotesque'. Don't focus your attention on the horrific elements, not either on the funny elements, but rather on the total weirdness of the whole. Yes, this movie is a gem of weirdness, it's a caricature of a horror movie; it exaggerates the stereotypes of that genre, therefore ridiculizing them (but not necessarily presenting them as plain funny).The first one of the series I saw was... well, the last: 'Army of Darkness', and I really enjoyed it as a comedy, so I managed to see this one, thinking it was pretty similar and guess what? I was disappointed 'cause I considered it more of a horror flick than of a comedy. Then I read the comments here and realized that for many other guys happened the opposite thing: they saw the 1st Evil Dead, enjoyed it as a horror, and expected this sequel to be something similar, but they were disappointed 'cause to them this looked more like... a comedy. What's the moral of this rigmarole of mine then? Here is: if you're looking for a horror movie get rather the first Evil Dead, and if you're looking for a comedy get rather Army Of Darkness; ED2 falls in between but nevertheless it got its own appeal, with its odd moments and weird hysterical characters (Yeah, Ash rules, but what about the witch in the cellar?). If tragi-comic, absurd and grotesque situations charm you this is definitely worth a go.7/10",9,1,1,6 June 2003
