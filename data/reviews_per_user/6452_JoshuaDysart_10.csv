The Lobster," Formalizing, Institutionalizing, Stigmatizing, Legalizing and Illegalizing Love.
","Social satire on human relationships in modern Western culture. You could call it social science fiction if you like, but that's not really the point... what we're really talking about here is a comedy about formalizing, institutionalizing, stigmatizing, legalizing and illegalizing love. I found it to be one of the most brilliant comments on society's expectations and complications of human interdependence put on film in recent memory. If ever (cautious hyperbole). And the entire aesthetic principle of the movie, the minimalism, the repeated forms, the crack down the middle of its structure, the emotional distance from its subjects... keeps you constantly on your heels as a viewer. Perhaps it's a tad too long, and maybe not the genius of narrative reveal and experiential filmmaking as Dogtooth (Lanthimose's earlier masterpiece), but this is staggeringly good work.",9,1,3,18 June 2016
It," All the quality of a made for Netflix movie
","Personally, I thought all the CGI buried Skarsgard's performance, I have no idea if he is interesting in this role or not. The film is rife with overplayed, standard horror imagery right out of the modern playbook (if I see the stutter cut monster run one more time...) and it's all very, very tired. There is very little imagination in scares, they have no weight or meaning. The whole thing feels like a YA horror story made for Netflix. Sophia Lillis and Jeremy Ray Taylor are breakout stars though, they're fun to watch, but in a standout year for horror, IT wasn't it. Hopefully, you enjoy it more than I did. I certainly seem to be in the minority here.",5,12,22,11 September 2017
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Neuters the Novel
","From the director of the amazing LET THE RIGHT ONE IN comes a movie with the same economy of image, but certainly not of narrative. Cinematographer, and general genius, Hoyte Van Hoytema turns in a vision of an era that seems almost entirely reliant on muted colors and a constant interior asbestos haze, which feels a little lazy, though the use of a lot of long lenses does successfully give the viewer the sense that they're spying on the whole endeavor from afar. The art and set decoration is amazing, with London at the end of its post-war weariness coming off looking particularly nice. All the actors are excellent except for Gary Oldman who manages somehow to overact even when playing the contained and muted George Smiley. The reveal at the end has all the bite of an old toothless dog and is arrived at in such a by-the-numbers fashion that it seems like a chore that needs to be gotten out of the way. The thing is that Le Carr√©'s work may be this dense and even 'plodding', but it's never this cold or unengaging. In suppressing and condensing everything the film makers have done him a disservice. All and all I'm a huge fan of real world spy thrillers and a student of the Cold War, and this is, of course a fictional retelling of the Cambridge Five traitors incident, so there's a lot here for people like me to enjoy and I do recommend it for that reason. The quiet reality of the Cold War is so rarely depicted in film and I'm always excited when someone tries. But when it's all said and done, I prefer the BBC mini-series staring Alec Guinness by a long shot, it simply seems to have more life in its bones.",7,6,11,14 December 2011
MASH," The debate over the inherent cruelty in MASH
","You know what MASH is. It's a culture icon. One of the most important films of the 1970's, but if you haven't seen it recently you might forget just how cruel the film is. There are a lot of different points of view about the cruelty baked into the film, here's mine...Yes, the film has sexist, racist, cruel and homophobic characters. But I strongly believe that the film is NOT laughing along with them. Again and again, we see the repercussions of callous behavior in the faces of the taunted. Altman holds on Frank Burns' face (through fire, no less) as he's being driven away by the military police after being pushed to violence. The infamous shower scene with Hot Lips isn't played for laughs to me at all, it's a horrible scene, just because people are laughing in the scene, that doesn't make it less horrible. It's a long-held shot of her humiliation, and ultimately, when she goes to her CO only to find him drinking wine in bed with another nurse, her futility. When Hawkeye and Trapper John are making fun of Japanese people, the driver of their jeep is openly irritated by their buffoonery. He verbally blames the culture of the Army for their behavior, repeating the phrase 'Goddamned Army' again and again. I do believe that Altman is saying something here about what war does to people. How spending hours every day trying to save mangled human beings creates a surrealist hell and hardens those who live in it. Also, let's not forget that this film is set in the fifties. The attitudes towards women, minorities, people of other cultures and homosexuality are not out of step with the era that the characters are supposed to be existing in. In that regard, it's not just a comment on the state of war, but on 1950's moral values as well.Having said all of that, it is undeniable that women get a pretty bad rap in this film. Hot Lips is a completely inconsistent character. She seems to change to become whatever the script needs her to be to get a laugh. One could argue that she changes in an effort to 'join them' since she can't 'beat them', but even this reasoning shows little regard for her character. The only other female of note in the film, Dish, has sex with Painless the dentist because her lover asks her to (in an effort to save his life, which is ridiculous). It's one thing for the main characters to be sexist. I'm not opposed to that. I don't need my protagonists to be 'good' people. But it's another thing when the universe of the film itself is sexist. And sadly, I do feel that is the case in this film. Fortunately, we have a whole body of work from Altman where he counters this attitude about women, but it does keep this film from being one of his absolute greatest achievements for me.Apart from that, the film is a technical masterpiece. The level of narrative communicated through what seems to be total chaos on camera is amazing. Scenes don't transition from sequence to sequence, they spill all over one another. Altman took the messiness of life and captured it in a bottle. It's also an incredibly edited.",8,2,5,13 February 2014
La La Land," A Dissenting Opinion
","A fantastically fun opening number and a pathos fueled final montage just can't save a staid script, mostly uninspired musical numbers, and good acting but thin 'performing' from the leads. I was far more bored than charmed. All and all it's nicely photographed, but over-colored in some desperate need to be dreamy, artificial and plastic. Too many super hot reds gobble up visual information instead of actually lighting the leads and the sets. To its credit, it's ambitious as hell, well-intentioned, and a bit of a production triumph. I appreciate many of the hand-built sets. But as an experience, it mostly fell flat for me. I know I'm in the minority here, which is totally fine it's just a movie, (from the disgusting display of opinion bashing in the comments section you'd think this was politics or something) but personally, I would've rather rewatched 'Singing in the Rain'.",5,5,9,2 February 2017
Halloween," A pure, perpetual suspense machine.
","It's the slimness of it. The clean open shots, mostly done in wides. The fact that it has so very few locations. It's the silent, completely blank, entity that is THE SHAPE. There are a mere five kills, modest by today's standards, and very little gore.John Carpenter's 'Halloween', which he co-wrote, co-produced, directed, musically scored (legendarily so), and co-edited, is a tight thriller built on the back of a Canadian thriller from four years prior called 'Black Christmas', and it's the starting gun for the slasher genre.You can't get from 'Psycho' to 'Friday the 13th' without passing through 'Halloween'.It's the afore mentioned economy of narrative that maximizes its tone and amplifies its horror. The movie is incredibly suspenseful.I mentioned how influential 'Black Christmas' was on this film, and 'Christmas' is a great movie, but even there, the increased scope and scale of 'Black Christmas' demands more drama, it mutes the scares by not being singularly focused on them. Not so 'Halloween'. 'Halloween' is a pure, perpetual suspense machine.It has its flaws, of course. Some of the acting is rough (though never from Jamie Lee Curtis) and a lot of the dialog rings false. You'll probably feel the need to yell at the protagonist when she, TWICE, throws a knife away from her in disgust without making sure her attempted murderer is dead. You might find Donald Pleasance a bit of a scene muncher.But for a budget of about $300,000 John Carpenter changed genre cinema forever, and the genius of what he achieved here has never been matched, certainly not in a film that bears the name 'Halloween'.",9,1,2,29 October 2018
Wonder Woman," I didn't like it, but that's not what's important
","Wonder Woman is a sincere film. Its heart is in the right place. It's thematically bang on. It's important. I'm very glad it exists. I'm glad it's being universally praised. It has some fantastic costume work in it and some strong production design. It is, indeed, better than recent previous attempts at bringing DC characters to the big screen (but then the bar has been set pretty low). I see little girls dressing as the protagonist and it makes my heart sing. I see comic book stores hosting Wonder Woman Day, I see the world falling in love with a character that I've always adored. These are all wonderful things. I was very excited for this flick. When the reviews were coming in strong, I let my hopes get high. I admit that I actively ignored my Rotten Tomatoes rule of thumb (any movie with more than 90% RT rating has a huge probability of sucking).But the film is, subjectively, pretty bad.It is overwrought. It is written as if by algorithm, meaning that it is simply an amalgamation of standard scenes you've seen before in other movies, just reskinned for this world and this character, everyone acts out every scene in extremely predictable ways. Its third act fight scene is extremely problematic and boring. It is inconsistent, Wonder Woman's presence and powers fluctuate so wildly that she can fight and kill a god, but not a handful of German's with WW I era rifles on a beach? The CGI is criminally bad, the physics in the special effects shots are so off that it seems like I'm watching a last gen video game.Its dialogue has exactly three modes: exposition, clumsy attempts at humor, and stating out loud the thematic intent of the scene.Its fight scenes are more often excuses to pose the character than acts of complex, readable staging, particularly the awful final fight. The use of slow motion in the fight scenes is so reliable and consistent that it seems like a parody of Zach Snyder's already completely unengaged video game fight choreography.The villains mean nothing. They are uninspired, dreary, and underutilized. Apart from seeing the very well visualized Themyscira, and the handful of times we get to see Wonder Woman in action, there is very little fun to be had in this movie. There is almost nothing that feels inventive and most of the film is colored in that same drab, dreary way that all of the recent DC films are colored.The movie is looooong, with a running time that used to be reserved for movies like The Piano, The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now, films with sprawling cinematic, thematic, and emotive ambitions that this does not even begin to have.Lastly, I can't tell if Gadot is incapable of acting or if the script gave her so little of substance to work with that she did an amazing job just keeping it all together.I have to ask why? Why does the DC universe so actively avoid fun, immersive, well crafted, and inventive storytelling? Why do they double down on this faux-epic, dismal pap? Why are they so afraid of color? Of bold comic-book like choices? Personally, I wish I had watched a little bit of Wonder Woman on cable and then turned it off like I have every other recent DC movie, but maybe voting with my dollar at least helped change the backward ass notion that women can't open big budget movies.Oh, well. As I said, the most important thing is that this movie exists, that people like it and that the character is back in the spotlight. That's all that matters. My opinion certainly doesn't. This wasn't a soulless or intellectually bankrupt film like the other DC movies have been, it was just bad, but maybe bad is good enough.",5,7,18,3 June 2017
Win Win," Absolute Artifice From Frame One
","This film is exactly the thing I rail most against in cinema. More so than crappy low-budget films, or bad genre films or obviously tinny dialog... it's this kind of thing. Where obviously capable, talented people pretend to be artistically ambitious by tackling very real lives and very human situations, then turn around and create the most fake, trite, saturated approximation of life you can imagine. This is what I call the Sundance Factor. Movies that claim to be about life but are really less true in their minutia than a 'Lord of the Rings' movie. Every glance, every human interaction, every performance, every depiction of struggle, misunderstanding and realization, every character is acted up, tarted out, over cooked and absolutely full of crap. Which would be alright if it was funny. But it's not funny. Not at all, despite the terribly stereo-typical, shallow, cringe-inducing, comic-relief character played by Bobby Cannavale.If you as a filmmaker are going to have this much of a disregard for the way people really act, speak and think then for god's sake, have someone in your film pull a gun out so at least I won't be bored.Suck Suck.",4,15,31,10 April 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," An Abject Failure...
","A horrible, bloated, clumsy and often surprisingly amateurish mess that constantly reaches for profoundly unearned emotions and falsely pumped-up thrills. Ann Hathaway's Catwoman is, by miles, the best thing in this overcrowded, misguided concoction (of course she's never called Catwoman, because ultimately Nolan is embarrassed to be doing a super hero movie, as virtually every creative decision he makes here proves). But like anything else that might even be a little bit interesting in this movie, her character and storyline are steamrolled with the rest of the ingredients into a flat, boring cacophony.The music is relentlessly pounding, probably in the hopes that you wont notice how rickety and poorly crafted the story is. Christian Bale virtually phones in his performance. He plays Batman as a mouth-breather (he actually never closes his mouth when in the cowl, making Batman look like some poor kid at summer camp with severe allergies) and he's incapable of bringing the slightest touch of character to Bruce Wayne. Where is Batman the master martial artist? The World's Greatest Detective? The unstoppable force of nature? Not here. Not in this movie. And the amazing Tom Hardy? Completely wasted and mostly unintelligible. The script is a train wreck. There are more plot holes and leaps of logic in this film than in the Avengers, and that movie had a Norse God fighting alongside a monster of science against giant interdimensional worms. The Avengers, by the way, was twice as fun, which was expected, but shockingly, only half as stupid as this movie. Here, let me give you a rundown of terrible, terrible logic loops, sustained stupidity, and just flat out disregard the for audience's intelligence. SPOILERS! 1. A massive terrorist raid on the stock exchange to make a single trade that leaves Bruce Wayne Broke. Okay... what the f.u.c.k.? A. Hacking a computer system does not require proximal space violence. It's called hacking. B. You're telling me they didn't shut down the stock exchange in a crises situation? C. No one questioned a massive trade that rendered one of the wealthiest men in the world broke, when that trade was performed in the middle of a destructive high-speed chase that would have been news across the entire country, let alone the entire world?2. Batman and Bruce Wayne are the least interesting characters to the filmmakers. Batman's time on screen is incidental and his actions boring. It is a Batman film with no interest in Batman at all.3. The Harvey Dent tough-on-crime bill has ended crime? Have you ever seen, in your lifetime, a city go from total social meltdown to utopia where the cops have nothing to do, because of a single bill that was passed? Later, when Gordon knows Dent didn't die a hero, he doesn't tell anyone, because somehow this will make the law less effective? For all his desire to make a 'real world' superhero film, Nolan obviously has no idea about how the real world works. Toon Town in the Roger Rabbit movie had a more realistic governing set of laws.4. Bruce Wayne is in prison forever and we hear the same damn story told over and over and over again, and it's all gender neutral so they can have one last tedious reveal at the end. 5. 'Your spinal vertebrae is sticking out of your back, here let me just punch it in! GHA! There much better. Only a matter of time before you're batman again.'6. I once saw an episode of Vice Travel where some journalist bought a dirty bomb in Chechnya for a handful of cash. Yeah. But Bane doesn't like doing things the easy way. God forbid he just buy a bomb from a corrupt ex-soviet general. No, instead he elaborately fakes the death of a scientist (apparently the only nuclear physicist in the world, by the way), waits for Wayne to build a fusion generator beneath Gotham so he can then steal its core and use it as an atomic bomb to hold ALL OF GOTHAM hostage. Then kills the scientist.7. It takes five months for the US to send special ops into Gotham? Really? Let's say Gotham is New York, which it is in this ponderous piece of crap. Let's say a terrorist was holding New York Hostage... for five months. You're telling me that the citizens of New York, that the military of the United States, that the nuclear scientists of the world... are going to let that happen? That the people won't rise up immediately, that the military won't have drones flying around constantly looking for radiation signatures and have infiltrated the whole damn island with special ops, that the scientists won't figure out a way to drop EMP pulse grenades across the island to shut down the mechanical device that triggers the fission explosion? Five months of just sitting on their hands?8. An atomic explosion off the coast of Gotham, and everything's cool! No worries! Radiation fallout? Na. Poisoned ocean? Forget about it. No big deal.9. And the worst crime of all, the co-opting of the OCCUPY RHETORIC to disenfranchise the movement. Occupy Wall St. slogans are readily and repeatedly spoken by a monstrous, mad, deceiving, mass murdering terrorist. Do we ever see the plight of the average joe in DK Rises? Never. Which is shocking since there are about 300 characters, each with more screen time than Batman. What we get is a real life political movement used in the fictional service of Kangaroo Courts, martial law, and dictatorship. I don't care if Nolan meant for Bane to be using the language of Occupy for his own corrupt and selfish ends, it's irresponsible filmmaking.And that's just some of the eye-rolling stupidity packed into this thing. All and all, DK Rises is tedious, boring crap.",1,59,112,26 August 2012
The Social Network," Dishonest to the last frame.
","This film is so desperate to sex up the life of a code-nerd with Asperger syndrome and ram home its banal theme (the man who created Facebook has no friends) that the truth, complexity, and to my mind, fascinating aspects of the real story gets thrown under the onrushing bus of one dimensional fiction. It's a hit job on a pack of real human beings and their motivations. Tonally, thematically and factually dishonest to the last frame. Good music though, and Eisenberg deserves the praise he's getting.The very source of this film is suspect. The book it's taken from was solely the revenge creation of Eduardo Saverin who approached the author after Saverin felt he had been jilted by Zuckerberg. The book was a revenge hit that left out facts, defamed people and made no attempt to interview any other parties involved in the matter. It was considered a joke and was never taken seriously by either the tech-crowd or the press. Now the movie hits and has Saverin being the good guy and Sean Parker - who actually helped Facebook grow into what it is today and is still a behind the scenes consultant, not to mention one of the most influential coders of our time - as the bad guy. I don't think Sorkin or Fincher have any clue about the code-monkeys who have changed their world forever, and if they do... they certainly don't seem to care enough to make real, complicated, ambitious art about them.",6,1,4,25 October 2010
