Hereditary," Can't quite believe the high scores previously rated.
","The trailers on tv led me to actually go and see this film (tonight). Overall, what a disappointment. I've no comments good or bad re: acting abilities/performance; I simply wish to express my 'enjoyment' or rather the lack of... Sure, it's a slow burner that sucks you in, but the last 15-30 minutes left a lot to be desired. So much so, I was actually laughing. I felt the film could've created so much more with the general plot and made it all the more believable/plausible. Two points in the main - 1) there was no follow through at all post Charlie's death; no police, no family interaction (until way into the film over the dinner table) and 2) Annie's headless body floating up into the treehouse was tantamount to parody. Other folk that were there commented post viewing, that they couldn't believe the reviews they'd read about how scary etc the film was. Having read a few on this site, supports what they'd read. However, unilaterally, we were all left disappointed and wanting..... It just reminds me of the hype surrounding The Blair Witch Project... so very, very disappointing. I'm just glad I only spent Â£4.50 to see it.",4,1,5,5 July 2018
