Your Name.," Good made movie, not that great plot.
","This movie will please those people that have that teen romantic side. That side that says that your love is somewehere on the world, and you will be together by some sort of mystical or non-conventional way. If you don't have that teen side don't watch that movie. Don't get me wrong, It's well made. But the plot falls short, it misses the opportunity to talk about more interesting topics rather than one hour and a half about a teen mind-made romantic history. It can talk about want to be another person and what you are now, or the need to have a femenine and a masculine perspective for having much more empathy... Overall, I was very disappointed.",5,28,61,15 October 2016
