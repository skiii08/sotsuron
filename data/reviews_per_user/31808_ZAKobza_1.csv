The Blair Witch Project," The Way Horror Movies Should Be Made
","This movie is the perfect model of an independent film and of horror movies in general. According to IMDb, this movie had a budget somewhere around $60,000 and made $140,539,099 over its lifetime according to Box Office Mojo. So, if you judge the success of a movie based on the money it made, The Blair Witch Project is a definite winner, but is it actually a good movie? Well there must have been something bringing that 140 million dollars to the box office over its lifetime, and I believe that was its creativity and its realism. This movie is the inspiration Cloverfield and Chronicle, and all the other found footage style movies we have today. The acting and camera-work is so believable that, at the time of its release, many people believed it to be a true story! Honestly, the characters were relatable and often times said what I was thinking while watching it. When you watch this movie, be sure to keep the volume up in order to really get immersed and hear all the creepy and disturbing noises the characters are hearing. This movie does horror right! I personally believe that jump scares are a cheap way to 'scare' the audience and filling a movie with jump scares does not make it scary. In The Blair Witch Project, there are no jump scares, so be sure to keep the volume up and get wrapped up in the legitimately frightening story that it is.",8,0,3,5 December 2014
