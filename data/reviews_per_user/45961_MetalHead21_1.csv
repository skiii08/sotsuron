The Equalizer," An 'almost' good movie
","The advertisement showed Denzel Washington starring,and that was the main reason i wanted to watch the film,and i did. Denzel didn't disappoint,as expected. But the story did. At times,i felt he didn't really need to get involved in the story at all-it was very impersonal. The violence is good and stylish and deserves credit,but the action was without point-the hero seemed to be fighting without a cause,as if fighting for the benefit of the human kind for its own sake and because of that,the movie seemed to keep dragging on. I found myself checking the time and wishing for the end.It could have been and should have been done better. I rate it 6 out of 10,mainly because of Denzel and the stylized action.",6,7,12,10 February 2015
