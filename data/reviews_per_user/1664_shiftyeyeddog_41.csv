Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Worst. Movie. Ever.
","Borat has been hailed as the funniest comedy in years. It's getting critical and public acclaim, not to mention huge box office success. I was a doubter - it looked like complete crap to me. Still, I kept hearing only great things, so I had to see for myself.When I'm right, I'm right. Oh. My. God. Easily THE worst movie I have ever seen in my entire movie-going history. I didn't laugh even once. Not even a chuckle. I just sat and shook my head in complete disbelief. What are people seeing in this pile of crap? I've disagreed with public consensus on many occasions, but not nearly to this degree. What am I missing?!? I actually found myself feeling angry as I sat through this garbage. It wasn't moral objection or disapproval - it was that something so unfunny was receiving so much praise. What the hell?! It's like a bad SNL character/Yakov Smirnoff impression crossed with supposed Jackass-style dupings of unsuspecting victims. I say supposed because much of the film is obviously staged, and for the bits that (possibly) were not, if these people didn't know immediately that they were being put on and it was all a (horribly unfunny) joke, well then they are just complete morons and deserve to look like idiots.",1,4,9,5 July 2007
The Incredible Hulk," Marvel is on a roll
","The new Hulk is not quite as drastically different from the previous one as they'd have you believe in terms of being action-packed. The Hulk still shows up rather sparingly for the first 3/4 of the movie, then finally takes center stage for the extended climactic finale. Not that I think it should be any different - I just don't think this one piles on the action much more than the last, as has been said. That being said, this film is a huge improvement over the mess that was the last Hulk film. From the acting to the writing to the effects, this blows away Ang Lee's version. The CG is not bad, and I'm sure it's probably the best possible at this time, but still looks very artificial, especially faces and when interacting with real characters. But such is the nature of movies - suspension of disbelief. The movie is pretty enjoyable, though, and chalks up another success for Marvel. If only the film rights to other characters like X-Men and Spider-Man would revert back to them so they can do them properly. Regarding the cameos: I have no problem with other Marvel characters showing up in cameos in these films - why shouldn't they all exist in the same universe? But I'm getting a little tired of the rest of these wink-wink cameos - this time we get Stan Lee AGAIN (seriously, in one movie it was funny, after that it's just annoying) and TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno. Stunt casting like that really takes you out of the story, and you have to listen to everyone in the theater turn to their friend or kid and say 'hey! that's _______!'",7,4,7,13 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," A HUGE improvement over #2
","Not bad at all. After the John Woo craptastic crapfest that was MI2, Lost creator JJ Abrams takes over and makes a flick that is at least as good as the first one, possibly better in some respects. Some real surprises early in the flick start things off fast, and it keeps up the pace pretty well from there on. Sure, it's mostly same-old same-old, but it was fun and action-packed. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was fine as a villain, but was really not even in the movie that much. Tom Cruise was just Tom Cruise as usual, but for two hours I was able to forget about all his offscreen stupidity. You know what this really felt like? 24: The Movie. ...which they are apparently going to make. It should end up being much like MI3, and I think that'd be just fine.",7,40,53,5 July 2007
In Bruges," Much Better than I Expected
","Another case of failed marketing. The trailer for this film did nothing to interest me, but I finally saw it based on a glowing recommendation. I'm glad I did.The film is at times alternately laugh-out-loud funny and touchingly dramatic. Its success hinges greatly on the performance and chemistry of its two leads, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, and both do phenomenal jobs (especially Farrell) helped by a witty script by Martin McDonagh. It had a very 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead' feel to it. Colin Farrell's role is an excellent departure from his usual characters, this one odd, hilarious, and almost child-like. I would love to see him (and Brendan Gleeson) score Oscar nominations for their performances in this film... but they won't.",8,1,4,15 July 2008
Kung Fu Panda," On par with Pixar's best
","One of the best animated films I've seen in a long while. Dreamworks is finally showing it can overcome the mediocrity of movies like Shrek, Bee Movie, and Madagascar, and put out a film that is not only fun, but shows excellence in animation as well. The CG animation easily stands up next to Pixar's work, and even the 2-D animated opening was beautifully done. I would've loved to see them even do the whole film in that style.Plenty of laughs to be had for audiences of any age. A truly enjoyable movie and likely the best animated film we'll see this year. (Sorry, but Wall-E isn't doing anything for me so far)",9,4,7,13 June 2008
Dawn of the Dead," A refreshingly good horror movie
","I like the new direction of horror films. After the ensemble-cast 'whodunnit' trend started by Scream, then the return to haunted houses, then the return of the 'unstoppable killer' (Freddy, Jason, etc). Now, with this film and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, there's a good blend of classic horror stories done with a current film-making-style attitude. There are two things I really liked about this movie: 1) They don't try to explain anything. You never know why the zombies exist, where it started, etc... You don't need to, that's not the point. and 2) The running zombies. Purists HATE it. They want the old 'zombie shuffle.' What the hell is scary about that? How hard is it to outrun or drive away from shuffling zombies?!? This way, they're scary. More intense. They still can't work doors or machines or anything, but their base instincts of chasing their prey is all that drives them. The movie's just good horror fun.",7,0,0,5 July 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A great middle chapter
","First: the movie  It truly is just the first half of one long movie, so I hesitate to 'rank' it in comparison to the first one, as many have done, until I see the last half (part 3). Depp is as great as ever, Bloom and Knightley hold their own as well as last time, and the supporting cast is excellent. I loved Jack Davenport in this film, with a new take on Norrington, and Naomie Harris brings an intriguing new character to life in Tia Dalma. I found the late-movie 3-way swordfight to be probably my favorite part, mill wheel and all. If there was anything in this film I liked least, it was definitely Davy Jones and his whole gang. I think the whole 'absorbing' sea life and such is just pretty pointless and goofy, and made for some dumb looking characters and bad CGI (though most of the FX in the flick were seamless and amazing). I know Jones was kind of the main point of the film and the primary villain, but I would've liked him better if he were just a regular pirate, sans octopus head and crab claw. This didn't ruin the movie for me or anything, but was easily my least favorite part (on my third viewing, I even went and watched another movie for about a half hour when Jones' group showed up). I personally can't wait to see where the third one goes. There are more than a few comparisons to be made to the original Star Wars films and even Raiders of the Lost Ark, but those have been more than sufficiently documented elsewhere. I'll just say I have no problem with them, as this trilogy is shaping up to be plenty worthy of a place alongside those.I don't quite understand some of the criticism people have toward the film. The most frequent are the length and open ending. Lord of the Rings, anyone? Those films were decidedly longer than this one, and had just as open an ending, if not even more incomplete. And as far as running time, I don't think there's any magical maximum that films have to adhere to. If you can't sit still for a longer film, maybe you should wait for DVD where you can break it up. I have also heard people complain that the characters, especially Captain Jack, have become jerks, or as one friend put it 'They spent the entire movie turning everyone into giant a-holes.' I don't see that at all. There are plenty of conflicts even between the heroes, and alliances and loyalties are constantly shifting, but such is to be expected in a PIRATE movie. Everyone is out for their own agenda, and if those goals line up with someone else's, they'll cooperate for the moment.",8,0,2,5 July 2007
Troy," A stellar cast in a pretty good flick
","It could have been shorter. It could have had a bit more character development. It could have had a stronger plot to string together the battles. However, I really liked it. Maybe it was the subject matter, maybe it was the cast, maybe it was the look of it and the cool battles, but I liked it. It's really the one-on-one battles that are more enjoyable and impressive than the large army clashes. It was interesting that they chose to show both sides equally, with neither being necessarily the 'bad guys.' More interesting is the fact that I don't think Helen was all that. Rose Byrne, as Hector's cousin (and Achilles' woman) Briseis, was far prettier. As usual, I won't go into great plot detail or anything, as every other review out there can tell you that. I'll just say it's worth catching, if only for the spectacular cast assembled here: Pitt, Bana, Gleeson, Cox, Bloom, O'Toole, Burrows, Bean, Byrne...",6,1,2,5 July 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Bloated but Undeniably Fun
","EDIT: Upon second viewing, I found it even more enjoyable and determined my comments were a bit too harsh. I still stand by my criticisms, but most of them, especially the running time and pacing, didn't distract me nearly as much as the first time around.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Somebody asked me for a one-word review of Pirates 3. The problem is, I can't really do that. Because if I absolutely had to, that word would be 'bloated.' But accurate as it is, it's way too negative. I liked the movie - I really did; and I think I'll like it even more upon a second viewing, when I can better digest and follow everything. There are some amazing sequences in it, and a lot of very creative ideas and writing - not to mention the perfect ensemble cast continues to put in remarkable performances.But like so many sequels, including its predecessor Dead Man's Chest, the movie is a little full of itself. Whereas the first film was just a fun adventure flick which had no expectations, this one is far to aware of its epic status. Every scene is drawn out as if to say 'look at this amazing sequence we thought up' and ' check out the awesome special effects!' As a result, you have a great 2-hour movie, stretched out over 2 hours and 45 minutes. I don't mind long movies at all, as long as they need to be that long and are not just over-extending scenes unnecessarily.I also think their efforts at making this an epic story have taken a lot of the heart out of the series. With each movie, more and more of the simple fun disappeared. Yes, there are comedic moments, but overall it's just lost a little something. I really wish they would just make sequels as stand-alone films, a la Indiana Jones, Die Hard, James Bond, etc, instead of trying to create these multi-film stories like Pirates and Matrix. I just think stand-alone stories feel fresher, more fun, and more enjoyable.The only other flaw is actually just a case of taking a good idea too far. The filmmakers have talked about how in the world of pirates, allegiances are constantly in flux and in question, which leads to a lot of betrayal and suspicion. But here they have so many people changing sides so often and making and breaking deals left and right, to the point where it's just so confusing you stop even trying to follow it. Maybe that confusion is what they were going for, but it really got to be too much after a while.So, yes, I do feel 'bloated' is a good word to describe the film, but it's still an immensely enjoyable flick, and far better then 95% of the movies that wil come out this year.",8,2,4,5 July 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A Hell of a Disappointment
","The GOOD: Prince Nuada and Princess Nuala, the character of Hellboy himself, and a couple of the one-on-one fights. The BAD: Most of the supporting characters, the creature designs, and a lot of bad creature voice dubbing - especially in the dumb 'young Hellboy' prologue that served as nothing but blatant exposition.The UGLY: Selma Blair's acting, the drunk/singing scene, and the love stories (especially the LAUGHABLE Abe Sapien/Princess Nuala relationship) Overall, I just found Hellboy II to be a step down from the first, and left me disappointed.",5,15,32,12 July 2008
Knocked Up," A dream cast of the new generation of comedy
","Comedy has basically fallen into three categories these days. There's the family friendly light comedies such as any of the crap Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy have done in the past 10 years, there's the moronic comedies with people like Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider, and there's the gross-out comedies. That's why it's so refreshing when a comedy comes along that is geared for adults. 40 Year-Old Virgin was a great recent example, and now the same team has returned with another success, Knocked Up.Based on the subject matter, language, and content, it's definitely for adults, but it doesn't need to resort to gross-outs for cheap laughs. The film has some real laugh-out-loud moments and is consistently entertaining for all of its two-hour-plus running time. While the second hour doesn't quite live up to the first, as it started to remind me more of Nine Months than 40 year-Old Virgin - not just the subject, but its tone and plot as well - it was still thoroughly entertaining. It manages to be be funny in all the right (and wrong) ways, but still ends up being a sweet film with real heart.The one thing that really makes the film work is the cast. Heck, even Ryan Seacrest made me laugh in his one scene. The group assembled here is like a dream team of the new generation of comedy - all very new up-and-coming talents (with the exception of Paul Rudd, who is only recently getting the attention and acclaim he deserves): Seth Rogen, Rudd, Jason Segal, Jonah Hill, Alan Tudyk, Kristen Wiig & Bill Hader (the only actually talented members of SNL these days), and several others from director Apatow's Freaks & Geeks and Undeclared. As a matter of fact, you could pretty much play the 'One Degree of Judd Apatow' game with the whole cast. Practically everyone from the two fore-mentioned shows makes an appearance, as well as people from 40 Year-Old Virgin, and even the director's own wife and kids play substantial supporting roles in the film.I really hope this group continues to churn out more films, as they are far superior to the 'frat pack' that seems to be considered the top of comedy right now - Ben Stiller, the Wilson brothers, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn (though I like some of his stuff)... I know I'll be waiting to see whatever they choose to do next.",8,0,2,5 July 2007
Alien," Borderline Boring
","Alien is not a bad movie. In fact, it's a pretty good one. More of a thriller than the sci-fi/horror ones that its sequels were. But therein lies my only problem watching the Director's Cut when it was re-released in the theater. I was reminded what a slow, borderline boring movie it is for the vast majority of its running time. Still, it was the only one I hadn't seen on a big screen, so it was cool to see it. I'll still take Cameron's Aliens over this any day. For that matter, I'm one of the few who actually liked Fincher's Alien3. Resurrection, well, I liked a lot about it, but there was plenty not to like as well.",6,3,6,5 July 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," An exciting movie... that we've already seen twice
","If the Bourne Ultimatum was just a single film, it would rate higher. But as the third in the series, it loses a little something, because all three of these movies are essentially the same film just rehashed again and again. They just add a new main villain, plug in a different 'asset' for him to have his climactic one-on-one hand-to-hand combat with, and give it a new title.Is the movie exciting? Affirmative. Great performances from a stellar cast? Definitely. Is the story interesting? Yes. ...BUT... the three movies could easily have been condensed to one film. Each of the Bourne films is essentially a two-hour chase scene... which CAN work as a movie. Think of The Fugitive. GREAT film. But now think if you took The Fugitive and stretched it out over three (or more) movies. It would just be too much. A lot of filler and repetitiveness. Now you get my point.I also had to deduct a point based on the ending of the film. It seemed they were going to finally bring the story to a close and tie up all the loose ends. But no, they had to leave themselves one of the villains as a loophole should they decide to make yet ANOTHER Bourne flick. Ultimatum would have been far more satisfying had they properly wrapped up the whole story, especially considering any books after this one were just cash-ins done by someone else rather than Ludlum himself.",7,1,2,13 August 2007
The Matrix Revolutions," Still bloated but not without its merits
","This'll be kinda stream-of-consciousness. I'm just gonna get all my thoughts out without really organizing.... Definitely a step above Reloaded, but that ain't saying much, is it? This movie was nowhere near as disappointing as that one, but it still had plenty of flaws.The first hour is slow and needless (for that matter, the entire second movie was unnecessary in the grand scheme of things). There's a scene at a fetish club that has no reason to be in there except to try to recreate the lobby scene from the original, only far less interestingly. The entire role of the Merovingian - that entire plot line - what was the point of that? It was completely superfluous and didn't play any real part in the end. But in the second hour, the redeems your ticket price.Some reviews complain that the leads all but disappear for a good half hour while we watch the supporting players defending the Zion invasion, trying to return to Zion, etc. The fact of the matter is, this was the best part of the film. I cared more about these people than the main characters. When we got back to Neo and Trinity, I was actually disappointed. Much of this movie felt like a video game: big action scenarios linked together with slow, questionably-acted cut scenes of dialogue. The final battle with Agent Smith and Neo? Cool enough - a true superhero slugfest, but dragged out and repetitive, much like Reloaded's 'burly brawl.' And the end? well, I won't spoil that for anyone, except to say.... that's it? All this led up to THAT?!?",6,0,0,5 July 2007
Wanted," A fun actioner that suffers from being a Fight Club wanna-be
","Wanted WANTED to be Fight Club with guns. It WANTED to be The Matrix, without the actual Matrix. It WANTED to be Mr. & Mrs. Smith: The Single Years But try as it might, it's not quite on par with those films. It has cool action, and plenty of it. The story is interesting enough as well. But when it tries to have some sort of message, that's where it stumbles. From the very beginning, its Fight Club envy shows - the self-loathing of the humdrum, meaningless, comfortable life; the narration that is remarkably similar both in content and tone; the sudden appearance of a stranger who can break you free of this mediocrity and let you truly live through pain and violence... From there the story kicks into gear, and is quite enjoyable. It's just that first 10 minutes (and a snippet at the end) that are trying too hard to make the movie something it is not and be a social commentary. The director has a flare for staging some crazy action, and creates some amazing visuals. Unfortunately, the movie, entertaining as it may be, is much emptier than than the film I suspect he thought it was. It's a case of style over substance, though not to the extent of, say, 300 - another movie that was great fun and had extraordinary visuals, but was light on substance. What it is, is exactly what the trailers sold it as: a great over-the-top suspend-your-disbelief actioner in the spirit of things like Transporter and Crank. Leave your brain at the door and just enjoy it.",7,1,7,27 June 2008
Van Helsing," What a mess
","Wow... that was even worse than I expected. Many will say I went in already planning to hate it. Well, go waste your money yourself and then tell me what you think. I watched most of this movie with my head shaking in my hands. It was SO bad. I'm just gonna randomly rant: Each actor's accent is worse than the last. The brides are comical and annoying. Frankenstein, played by another Australian stage actor, sounds like a stage actor, practically singing all his lines and overacting. I thought I was watching a musical a couple times. The worst Dracula ever put on screen. The effects range from good to horrid. The music... okay, the music I liked. What were Kate and Hugh thinking? I like both of you! RUN from this crap! Do NOT do a sequel! Blatant plot exposition everywhere. Horrible dialogue. Why does every character (including Frankenstein) have ninja-like reflexes and agility? Every character was playing Spider-Man out there! WAY too much coincidence and predictability. Y'know what? I'm done. There's much more, but I won't waste any more time on it here.",2,1,2,5 July 2007
Tropic Thunder," Quite Disappointing... and Tom Cruise is HORRIBLE
","So much unrealized potential. It's a funny concept, and it has its moments, but is ultimately disappointing. A much-hyped gathering of an all-star list of actors, yet of the 3 major players, only Robert Downey Jr turns in a performance worth watching. Surprisingly, one of the strongest in the bunch was supporting player Jay Baruchel. Danny McBride manages to not be funny now for the second time this month after Pineapple Express. Why are they trying to make this guy a star?Then there's Tom. Tom Cruise's role here would not have even been amusing as a cameo, but they go even further and stretch it out into an entire supporting role, and in all his scenes, he fails to elicit even a single chuckle. To top it off, he is featured in a pointless scene at the very end and over the credits that was so annoying and unfunny it was almost enough to make me dock its rating another whole star.",5,5,14,14 August 2008
Quantum of Solace," Making a direct sequel was the biggest mistake.
","Making a direct sequel to Casino Royale was the biggest mistake. Bond has never had them, and Ian Fleming didn't write it. Why mess with a proved formula? But they did, and the result is one of the more mediocre Bond films in recent years, and one that feels short and somewhat unsatisfying.Quantum of Solace is a curious thing. All the pieces are there, but it simply never feels like James Bond. The villain is bland and unthreatening. The women are bland. And aside from one or two decent sequences, even much of the ACTION often feels hollow. ...and it doesn't help that Bond himself mopes his way through the entire film.Marc Forster, director of 'Monster's Ball', 'Finding Neverland', and the UNWATCHABLE 'Stay', just doesn't know how to handle action, and he tries to make up for it with chaos. But while some movies like the Bourne series use the so-called 'shaky-cam' style effectively, Forster's is closer to the 'what the hell is going on' version seen in films like Transformers. No, Forster is usually more at home with angsty, conflicted character pieces, but even the characters aren't particularly satisfying.I do love Daniel Craig as Bond, and he does his best here, but it's no Casino Royale. And while defenders say 'this is just like the second part of Royale', that doesn't excuse its deficiencies; it only supports the idea that they'd be better off sticking to stand-alone stories and getting back to the Bond we know and love.",6,1,3,14 November 2008
The Butterfly Effect," Ashton continues to surprise
","I can't figure out Ashton Kutcher. On That 70's Show I thought he had potential. He did Just Married, which I personally found quite amusing, and thought he was good in. Then he became tabloid fodder and was everywhere, being the annoying, obnoxious guy we all see him to be. I blame Punk'd. I admit, I find some of them very funny, but he just comes across as so completely immature and obnoxious. But then I see this film, and again I think he's got something. He played his role quite well, and never once resorted to his usual style of lowest-common-denominator humor.I'd probably closest compare this to Final Destination. It's something different, very well done, with its own tone and style, and not driven by star power. New Line Cinema continues to impress me as a force in the genre. While not anything groundbreaking or spectacular, this film is satisfying. Here's hoping Kutcher continues to make good project decisions.",6,2,2,5 July 2007
Mamma Mia!," Surprisingly Infectious Fun
","In my mind, this movie had a lot of negatives to overcome: Christine Baranski, Meryl Streep singing, a cast that didn't exactly scream 'hit', ...the music of ABBA, for pete's sake! But as difficult as it is to say, I'll say it.... I am a heterosexual male, and I enjoyed Mamma Mia! There's plenty to like - Amanda Seyfried's infectious joy (and beauty), the stunning Greek isle scenery, and yes, the music. It won me over practically from the start. The positives far outweighed the negatives - in fact, the negatives turned out not to be. Abba's music never did much for me as pop songs, but in the context of a musical, they work quite well. There are a couple numbers I think could have been left out, specifically Baranski's 'Does Your Mother Know' and Streep and Brosnan's 'Winner Takes It All', but even those weren't bad. The singing is good pretty much across the board. Even the weakest singer, Pierce Brosnan, did a surprisingly good job. His voice has a certain Peter Gabriel quality to it (with a dash of Randy Newman). For those friends of mine that refuse to see anything not considered a 'manly' movie (and you know who you are), skip it. But for everyone else, take a chance on Mamma Mia. You may find yourself tapping your toes and smiling along.",8,4,5,14 July 2008
28 Days Later...," Overrated and Underscary (is that a word?)
","Started off pretty good. Interesting, eerie, lots of potential. But by half way through, I knew disappointment was in the air. The 'infected' are barely involved, just showing up occasionally to keep our main characters moving on to the next place. And while the ads boast 'scary as hell,' I'd have to say it's anything but. Not one moment in this film was truly scary. As for the cast, they did okay. It's always good to see Brendan Gleeson in another role, and Christopher Eccleston, while his character was a bit lacking, did good with what he had to work with as well. The other newcomers weren't bad, but it won't be a breakthrough role for any of them. This seems to be the Blair Witch of this year. People want a good scary movie, and word-of-mouth is pushing this one, but it's mind-boggling to figure out who it is that thinks this is good. Was it a horrible movie? No. But it's nothing I'll ever care to see again. I'll take my clichéd American horror movies over this any day, thank you.As for the 'alternate ending'... What a joke. I mean, actually the alternate one (while not as upbeat, so mainstream America will hate it), is better, because the ending they used takes a giant leap and makes no sense at all. But this kind of gimmick is best left to DVD extras.",4,4,6,5 July 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Better Than Expected
","I went in expecting the worst. Brett Ratner has really done nothing to give me any faith in him, and the way this filmed was rushed, not to mention the fact that the writers and original director bolted to do Superman Returns instead, worried me greatly. But in the end, it didn't suck. I'd say it's as least as good as #1. I'm still waiting for them to make that great X-Men film I know can be made. Was this one great? No. The film definitely has its flaws, but it's mostly satisfying. Too many characters are crammed in, giving them all too little development or screen time. They make some MAJOR decisions that affect the ongoing story, but in the end they kinda chicken out and back off and leave lots of doors open. It's pretty much what I expected going in - an okay movie with some really good scenes. I loved seeing this at the midnight show with a crowd of real fans. They were excited, and got all the in-jokes, including one they threw in based on an internet spoof - the crowd went wild! I hope they continue to make more of these. They could easily rotate out entire casts if they get too pricey, as there is a DEEP roster of characters they still have to choose from, and the younger members in this movie were some of the better characters and actors. And get rid of Halle Berry - her hairstyles got better each movie, but her acting sure didn't.",6,0,1,5 July 2007
Stardust," Maybe Fantasy Just Isn't My Genre
","With the success of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, Hollywood went scrambling to grab up any literary fantasy properties they could get their hands on. Unfortunately, most of them don't seem to be translating to the screen very well, and they're apparently really scraping the bottom of the barrel to find new ones to turn into film series. The latest example: Stardust. Now, I haven't read the book, but I've heard a lot of good things about Neil Gaiman's works, so I have to think that in this case either the fault lies with the filmmakers, or maybe it's just a good book that doesn't make for a good movie. ...or maybe the book sucked too. I don't know.I really wanted to like it going in, but by about ten minutes in, I already knew I'd be disappointed. I was hearing comparisons to The Princess Bride in some reviews, but beyond the fairy-tale type aspect, there's no comparison. This film should not be mentioned in the same sentence. The direction was lacking, the story completely predictable and silly (and not in a good way), and the casting questionable. The biggest offender here is Robert Deniro in a dull, pointless turn as Captain Shakespeare, the man with a mean reputation who it turns out is very sensitive and effeminate. Look! It's Deniro acting gay! Isn't that hilarious?!? ummm... NO. (Though there plenty in my theater who were laughing like crazy. The same crowd, I would guess, that made the painfully unfunny Wild Hogs a smash hit.) I also have to wonder about the casting of Sarah Alexander (Coupling) as one of the witches. Here you have an attractive young blonde actress who you put in ugly, decaying, old witch makeup. I assumed that, like Michelle Pfeiffer, they cast her because you'd see her young again at some point. But we never did. So they could just as easily have put an actual old woman in the role. I don't get it. Maybe there were some scenes cut out or something.One other observation: the guy who did the score has SERIOUS Hans Zimmer envy. Practically every music cue sounded like it was lifted directly from Pirates of the Caribbean.The movie wasn't a complete disaster, but I can't recommend it to anyone, and I doubt I'll ever watch it again. Like I said, maybe fantasy just isn't my thing. I enjoyed the LOTR movies, but the rest of the series they're scraping up to cash in on the trend are just falling way short. Potter, Narnia, ...next up is The Golden Compass, from Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series. The cast looks good, and the trailer is somewhat interesting, but I'm going in with low expectations, based on my disappointment with the latest genre entries. Hopefully it will prove me wrong.",4,9,25,13 August 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A record-breaking Eyeroll Tally
","The first Fantastic Four was pretty bad. The writing bad, the casting horrible, the FX lacking but it was harmless enough. There have been crappy superhero movies before, and there will certainly be plenty more in the future. But a sequel?? Really?? What won't they make sequels to these days.They learned nothing from their mistakes on the first film. The Thing's costume is still terrible and looks like something out of a mid-80's flick, and his one-liners (mostly consisting of about 10 'sorry's' and 'my bad's') are just annoying. Julian Glover as Dr. Doom is horribly miscast. Reed's stretching effects just look laughable - it's one of those powers that just does not translate to the screen well. Jessica Alba again looks goofy with fake blond hair, but now they've added the creepiest fake blue eye contacts you've ever seen, and just can't stop staring at them whenever she's on screen. Stan Lee's cameos continue to be distracting and stupid.But they didn't stop there - this sequel has failed on more levels. First and foremost, the Eyeroll Tally was OFF THE CHARTS. From every cheesy line to every bad joke, every dumb plot point to every stupid sight gag or bad effects shot, you couldn't help rolling your eyes. The one big theme they beat us over the head with is teamwork. Johnny (Human Torch) is told he's a loner and needs to learn to work as a team. So how does he do this in the end? By taking on everyone else's powers and fighting the final battle by himself. Huh?!??! That's teamwork? This flick was every bit as bad as any of the direct-to-video or 80's Marvel movies. Now there's talk they want to do a spin-off Silver Surfer movie. HELL no! His character is boring, unimpressive, and uninteresting in his brief scenes here, much less an entire film. The torch/surfer chase was pretty cool, but it's too bad everyone had seen that in its entirety in the first trailer. When Surfer loses his silver 'luster' he looks hilarious as just some dude painted dark gray, and trying to cash in on Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus credibility by having him voice the Surfer was just lame. Fishburne adds nothing here.Like I said, I've seen worse flicks, and I know this was geared more for kids, but even kids deserve better. And with so many better flicks to choose from, I hope they find something else to spend their money on.",4,2,5,5 July 2007
Transformers," *sigh* It could have been SO cool...
","I actually went into this one with somewhat high expectations. I expected that even if it didn't succeed at being a good translation of Transformers, it would at least be a fun, exciting giant-robots-kicking-ass flick. It succeeded at neither.I tried to look at it both ways. As a guy who grew up with the cartoons and toys, I wanted it to capture that same fun and action. But Michael Bay, who went in knowing very little about it, and treating it with condescension, took everything he personally didn't get or like about it, and simply changed it. These changes make it hard to like for a real fan of the original. Some Decepticons are cars now? The Transformers can change what they change into? How convenient that all the parts match up no matter what they want to become. The whole design of the robots is horrendous. They should have kept them simple, but they've made them so complex, disjointed, and busy that they look like random globs of metal. There are many points in the film where you can't even tell which robot you're looking at. They've treated the robots not as full characters, but as FX toys. When they make feeble forced attempts to inject personality, it fails completely. They just come across as dumb or obnoxious. One of the main plots of the story is supposed to be the relationship between Sam and his car, Bumblebee, but you get absolutely no sense of any connection there. When they are separated, or when Bumblebee is being 'tortured,' you don't care at all because they haven't established that connection. If you want to see that kind of story done right, watch The Iron Giant. The movie also makes the mistake of focusing far too much on humans. A little human involvement is to be expected and necessary, but there are so many unnecessary characters and plot lines. The entire military and Pentagon angles could easily be cut, especially horrible pointless characters like Anthony Anderson and John Turturro's.So the faithful translation was out. So why not enjoy it as just a cool action/sci-fi flick? I tried. But there are just WAY too many horrible attempts at humor and childish sight gags. The first hour of the movie is especially painful to watch, with one bad one-liner after another, and the worst character of all, a small, supposedly funny robot named Frenzy. The action itself is more frustrating than anything. Giant robots fighting and transforming and causing destruction should be cool and exciting, right? Not here. I've always been a defender of Michael Bay's frenetic style and shaky-cams, but here it's just unwatchable. Coupled with the bad robot design, you can't even tell what the hell is going on half the time. The last half hour is a repetitive mess.If there's one thing I never thought I'd be in a flick like this, it's bored. But I was. Bored and annoyed. I probably checked my watch ten times by the time it was over. It wasn't a completely awful film. It was just a gigantic disappointment on all levels, because it COULD have been such a cool flick. A ten-year old kid would probably love this flick, but anyone else, if they were being honest, would have to admit that it could have been SO much better.One review I saw sums it up PERFECTLY: 'It's like spending a day at the state fair: a little bit of actual entertainment, a lot of embarrassingly cheesy attempts at entertainment, and the faint whiff of bull crap everywhere.'",4,3,8,7 July 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Should've cut 2 parts down to one 2-hour movie
","I would say this movie was the 'Matrix Reloaded' of this year, except that Reloaded WAS this year. Tarantino's suffered from all the same problems. Almost all scenes, fighting or dialogue, went on about twice as long as they needed to, several scenes just shattered the realm of even our most suspended disbelief, and finally this movie just thought it was way better and cooler than it really was. It had such potential, and did have some really good ideas and even some good scenes, but could have easily been only one hour long, so this whole 2-part BS could've been one film. Maybe with both parts together (and abbreviated) it could add up to one good film's worth.Worst of all: At least the Matrix decided to use the separate Animatrix DVD to tell superfluous unnecessary back stories and side plots. No, Kill Bill decides to give us the wholly pointless origin of one of its supporting characters, and does it with a 10-15 minute segment, which would be bad enough, ...but they also decided, for no reason, to do it in anime...and not very good anime at that. Last complaint: the music. Wow, was that annoying.",4,1,2,5 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Let's be honest - They should just call this movie 'The Joker'
","Let's get this out of the way right off the top: Heath Ledger is nothing short of amazing in this film. ** Heath Ledger's Joker makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like Cesar Romero's Joker. ** Less cartoony and far more menacing, this Joker actually feels dangerous. Every moment he's on screen your eyes are simply glued there, just soaking in this iconic performance. His look, his mannerisms, his voice... they all come together to make the perfect Joker, and probably the best villain ever seen on screen in a superhero movie... or any movie, for that matter. It's really quite a shame Ledger passed away, as I would love to have seen him portray that character again and again. Does the rest of the movie match this level of excellence? Well, not entirely... It's got plenty of action, just enough humor, and a good script for the most part, but there are a couple minor things that bothered me slightly: If they have to recast Rachel Dawes, fine, but Maggie Gyllenhal is a big step down; Bale's gruff 'Batman' voice still sounds a little over-the-top and almost humorous at times; and the movie takes a few unnecessary turns, especially towards the end. Much off this is due to the involvement of 'Two-Face.' This film didn't need a second villain. His time on screen does nothing but make the audience wish they'd hurry up and get back to the REAL villain. I've never cared for the character, and I suppose it's good they didn't wait to try to use him as the sole foe in a future film, but he simply didn't do anything for me. Aside from those aspects, however, it's difficult to find much to criticize in this movie. I struggled greatly with the rating for this one, as without The Joker, the rest would only have made for another above-average film like Batman Begins. But Ledger's Joker is undeniably the star of this show, and based on that performance alone, I spot it the higher rating. Forget The Dark Knight - they should just call this The Joker. Ledger simply OWNS this film.",8,9,18,18 July 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The Elusive Charlie Kaufman
","Charlie Kaufman scripts are tricky things. With all the right other elements in place, they can be great (Adaptation, for example). If not, however, they just don't quite work. Sometimes, a director who can handle his work right (e.g. Spike Jonze) is on board, but the film is miscast (Being John Malkovich - I really thought Diaz and Keener were wrong). Other times, the cast is right, but the director is all wrong (Human Nature). This film falls under the latter. It just felt like the movie never quite came together. We never got too involved with the characters, and the editing, pacing, and direction didn't let them develop at all. I thought it was a very interesting idea, and I thought the actors did fine jobs, but the movie wasn't what it could have been.",6,1,3,5 July 2007
Taken," Best (non-superhero) action flick of the year
","Liam Neeson: Bad-Ass?? Hell yeah he is. Believe it or not, Neeson stars in the best (non-superhero) action movie of the year. This movie was the out-of-nowhere surprise of the year I've been hoping for.As an ex-government agent out to find and rescue his kidnapped daughter, Neeson's character is like Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer combined, except that this guy could take either of those two down in a heartbeat. He's skilled, intense, and won't hesitate to take down anyone who stands between him and his daughter.This film opens in the U.S. in September, and it's a shame that it is getting virtually no promotion. Neeson isn't the biggest box office draw, much less as an action star, but I urge everyone out there to give this a chance. It's a thrilling action/drama that truly impressed me, and it's full of moments that make your jaw drop, make you cheer, and make you yell, 'Daaaaaaamn!'",9,4,9,27 July 2008
Grindhouse," Rivals 'Norbit' for WORST movie of the year
","Okay, so 'Planet Terror' was mildly amusing. It's far from the classic people want it to be, but it's watchable.'Death Proof' on the other hand, was one of the biggest wastes of time I've experienced in YEARS. Slow, boring, far too much pointless dialogue, and even the acting is atrocious. Even Kurt Russell, who is usually enjoyable even in bad flicks (and he's done plenty), acts so badly in this movie you wonder if he's trying to tank this piece of junk movie on purpose.Taratino is such an overrated director. He made one great film (Pulp) and Reservoir was alright, but since then it's been self-indulgent, pointless crap filled with bad music, annoying characters, and lame dialogue. This man needs to retire NOW.Don't bother renting it, don't bother watching it for free. It's not worth your time....but yes, in the end, Norbit still holds the title for worst of the year. This is just a very close second.",1,5,11,25 September 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A big step down from Azkaban
","After flirting briefly with passable film-making with the third movie in the series, they've taken a big step backwards this time. It's not nearly as bad as 1 or 2, mind you, but it sure ain't good.With three different directors having taken the reins, it would be easy to lay the blame on the director. But he certainly can't be the only one responsible here. No, it takes the combined effort of a whole lot of people to make so many things about a movie suck. First and foremost: the story. I've never been a Potter fan, that's no secret, even though I thought the third film was alright. The story here is just as lame and simplistic as the last few, and the horrible writing of both Rowling and the screenplay adapter create such an awful, pathetic plot that I found myself laughing AT the movie and shaking my head in amazement that so many people love this crap. What the hell were those choreograohed entrances of the different schools' students?!? The bath scene (with another badly acted and stupid character - that dead girl)? A Dance? Blatant exposition when Voldemort decided to explain what happened years ago? And again, as in the first films, the headmasters arbitrarily rewarding Harry with extra points or consideration just because he's our hero. And don't even get me started on the painfully horrible dialogue. The acting is just as melodramatic and bad, and the character designs are getting more laughable. 'Mad Eye Moody' (a complete waste of Brendan Gleeson's talent), has this eye that is the stupidest looking thing I've ever seen in my entire movie-going life. It looks like someone's bad homemade Halloween costume. Simply idiotic. Lastly, the special effects were really not done very well. much of it looks somewhat obviously fake, and even when it is well done, it's often not integrated very well with the live action elements and that makes it look lame.Of course, much of this would be completely forgivable and understandable if it was truly a film made for kids. Kids don't care about bad acting or bad effects or silly dialogue. But with a series like this, which tries to boast that it's a film for all ages, backed up by the PG-13 rating on this one, it sure comes off extremely juvenile to me. I just don't get it. It's just like the books - If the kids love it, fine. But the fact that adults praise these films and love them? I just don't understand. I guess I never will.",3,1,2,5 July 2007
The Happening," Unintentionally hilarious
","Here I thought M. Night Shyamalan had finally made a movie I would like. The movie even started out very well, setting up a mysterious and interesting premise. But once they start tossing theories around, and acting on those ideas, the film becomes an unintentional comedy. Outrun the wind! Nature only hates us in groups larger than five!The few moments of intended comedy are the least funny moments in the film, completely out of place and forced. Pointless subplots and relationship issues don't help the matter any. In the end, it's just a boring mess. As one critic stated, 'The Happening is a movie to walk out of, sleep through, or - best of all - not to bother with' Shyamalan's films have gotten progressively worse with each new one, and this is easily one of his worst, but I don't think I can call it worse than his Lady in the Water.",2,2,7,13 June 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," 90 minutes of good movie crammed into 148-minute running time
","First off, I didn't hate the movie. It was alright. The problems are 3-fold. * Every scene is about twice as long as it needs to be. Every fight scene, every chase scene, every dialogue scene. They just dragged on and on to the point where you're actually wishing a previously cool scene would just end already. Which probably has much to do with..* The filmmakers take themselves way too seriously. Everything was done for the sake of itself. Fight scenes because a fight scene would be cool here. A love story because they think they should have one. Philosophical babble because it'll make them sound deep. I think they bought into the rantings of the 'Philosophy of the Matrix' books and such that tried to read into it as more than just entertainment inspired by various influences (pop culture, religious, and otherwise). They're trying to be so deep, to create a mythology, but come off as just posturing and rambling. * The effects. Sure the fight scenes and all the FX in the movie are cool, but they were just given too much money this time. There was a seemingly endless, pointless scene of watching a ship come in and dock. I swear it had to be ten minutes. They also relied on CGI when the scenes were looking just fine with practical effects. It's jolting when you can notice the exact moment whenever it converts to a CG shot. Part of the dissatisfaction with the movie may be the lack of resolution. As the middle chapter of the story, it obviously has loose ends, right down to the quite generic cliffhanger-style ending (bum-bum-BUMMMMMMM!!!). But while I enjoyed parts of it, it will be a much better film when I can watch it with a fast-forward button.",5,1,2,4 July 2007
War of the Worlds," Possibly the most frustrating film EVER
","The most frustrating film I've seen in a long time. Why? Because it was actually pretty good, for the most part. It seemed like a great story following just a normal guy and his family trying to survive and escape the alien invasion. He wasn't the big hero. He didn't figure out how to kill the aliens. He wasn't the president or some military guy who led the attack. Just a normal guy. I think this makes a great companion piece to Independence Day (which I watched the next day), whereas that told the story of the heroes and those discovering how to bring the aliens down, this one told the story of the everyman trying to survive. Unfortunately, this movie drops the ball with the single least satisfying ending of all time. It just.... ends. So suddenly, so stupidly, so frustratingly, that it killed my whole opinion of the movie. Too bad...",6,1,3,5 July 2007
Love Actually," Too many story lines...
","There's a good movie in here somewhere. A few story lines, given more screen time and development, could have made for a very entertaining Christmastime romantic comedy. Unfortunately, the glut of story lines and overstuffed cast ultimately hurt the film. No story is given enough time to make us really care too much about any characters, and several feel like they were completely superfluous and unnecessary. The Brit who went to Wisconsin, the porn stand-in couple, Laura Linney and her co-worker, Colin Firth's story... these were all completely pointless. Keira Knightley's storyline probably had the least screen time of all, to the point where when they showed up on screen near the end, both Kathy and I looked at each other and said, 'I'd forgotten about this whole story!' While Keira's jaw and gritted-teeth smile annoy the hell out of me (and her stick-figure doesn't help), this is one of the stories that had potential, but failed to deliver due to it brevity.Several of the characters, therefore, were also unnecessary, especially the pointless cameos. Rowan Atkinson, featured on the poster but barely in the film, Shannon Elizabeth, Denise Richards, 24's Elisha Cuthbert... and I don't buy Billy Bob Thornton as the U.S. President for one second. The best actor of the movie was probably the kid who played Liam Neeson's son.So basically it's disappointment. A great cast list, but by trying to squeeze so many people in, they've actually hurt what the film could have been. It was amusing at times, but nothing more.",5,1,2,5 July 2007
Hancock," Great Concept, Flawed Execution
","Hancock is getting a lot of undeserved criticism. Is it a perfect film? No. But is it a mess, or even the massive disappointment it's been made out to be? Not at all.Hancock is a movie that tries to tell too much story, and ends up telling too little. I've heard it said that this film feels like all setup (similar to my comments about Jumper). But I believe differently in this case. I think if it was hoped this character would continue in subsequent films, they should have kept this first film just the introduction of the character, with his down-and-out reluctant-hero attitude, and his transformation to a more positive image and attitude (with a new subplot/villain to make a complete film). The second film could have delved more into his origins and history and his encounters with and relationships to others with his power. Then from there, they could go anywhere they wanted. As it is, though, I hope this remains a stand-alone film with no sequels. It's a great concept (both his early film personality and his origins), I loved the cast, and the film was entertaining; but it has left itself nowhere to go from here without just being the typical superhero movie.The film also feels very incomplete, like there was more to it - and from what I hear that's exactly the case. I'm very curious to see the inevitable (hopefully) director's cut of the film. Reportedly Peter Berg had to cut and alter quite a bit (it now runs barely 90 minutes) to get the desired PG-13 rating and the film the studio wanted - a safe family-friendly Will Smith summer flick. I think there's a good chance that in trying to increase the success of the film by mandating a PG13 film, they actually may have hurt its chances by neutering it.",7,2,5,5 July 2008
WALL·E," Charlie Chaplin, Pixar-style
","Animation, especially CG animation, has found its success largely through making things talk that normally don't - animals, toys, cars, etc. So it's ironic to find that one of Wall-E's greatest strengths is that is practically a silent movie.There are sound effects and (very) limited dialogue, of course, but this very well COULD have been a silent movie, and you wouldn't have missed a thing. Wall-E is like a Charlie Chaplin movie brought into the 21st... well, actually, 28th century. It has a definite Chaplin 'Little Tramp' feel to it.What sound it does have is extraordinary. The score is probably the best of the year, though I swear I heard music cues from all kinds of other films, from Indiana Jones to Star Wars to composer Thomas Newman's own American Beauty. Ben Burtt, Lucasfilm soundman extraordinaire, crafts the beautiful sounds that carry the film, so it's fitting that he also gets to provide the voice of Wall-E himself. It's easy to overlook the contribution and the pure beauty of the sound, as well as the outstanding animation. We've come to just expect greatness from Pixar, plus it's so perfect, you just don't even notice the technical stuff.At its heart, though, in spite of its technical achievements, this is THE love story of the year. Wall-E is simply a thing of beauty.",9,1,3,27 June 2008
Iron Man," A strong contender for best superhero flick of all time
","Iron Man. Who'd have thought?Quite simply one of the best superhero flicks ever made, and a strong contender for the top spot. I honestly don't know if I can pinpoint a single flaw in the film, except that I wish it was even LONGER. Not only does it succeed as a comic book adaptation, it succeeds as just a great MOVIE. Probably the most fun flick I've seen in a good two years or more.So how did this movie get it right when so many others get it all wrong? It certainly isn't just the character. Iron Man is a second-tier Marvel character that never really caught my eye much or gained the general public's love. I believe it was two factors: casting and respect for the material.First and foremost, I can't imagine anyone but Robert Downey Jr. playing this role. He owns it so completely and is such a perfect fit that I have to wonder how much of the script was completely re-written for him or was improvised. His brand of humor and wit, along with his great range as an actor allow him to convey the whole arc of Tony Stark's story, and to make it entertaining every step of the way. I am especially impressed at the studio's decision to *gasp* actually cast an appropriate actor over 40 years old, rather than cast young just to bring in the teen box office.While so many other comic book flicks treat their material (and audiences) condescendingly, or just as a silly story that can be used to show off cool effects or action scenes, Iron Man instead respects that it can be just as good or respectable as any other film. Nothing is over-the-top or forced. The story is much more grounded in reality than most superhero genre films - There are no 'superpowers', just technological genius and talent. It's taken to extreme degrees, for sure, but never feels far-fetched or silly. The film also shows you can include comedy without it being blatant comic relief, full of forced silliness and one-liners. No the laughter here is genuine, and lots of it. I laughed more in this film than I have in any actual comedy film in a long time.Recent superhero flicks like Batman Begins and Superman Returns were well-made, exciting, and dramatic, but lacked the fun factor. The overall tone of those films is so dour that repeated viewings are a bit of a chore. Then others like the Fantastic Four came out and went in the too far in the other direction, being cheesy and dumb. Iron Man got back to the tone of the first two Superman films and found the perfect balance of drama and comedy.I could go on about every aspect of the film - the supporting players, score, effects... but I'll just say it all clicked. The rest of the summer's flicks are going to have a lot to live up to. I suspect this is the movie people will go back and see again and again, as other summer fare fades away. Just plain fun.",10,4,8,4 May 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Worry not - Die Hard is BACK!
","A movie needs four things to really feel like a true Die Hard movie: Bruce Willis as John McClane, Michael Kamen's musical score, Jan DeBont's cinematography, and a memorable villain.Live Free or Die Hard has only one of those four things....yet despite that fact, I was surprised to find that it is not only a good flick, but probably the best Die Hard movie since the first. Bruce is back in full force as McClane. Marco Beltrami did a phenomenal job of imitating Kamen's scores, possibly even using some of the same themes and musical cues from previous films. This goes a long way toward creating the atmosphere of a Die Hard film. The cinematography seemed a little more modern and slick than previous installments, but they were very smart in avoiding a lot of the modern trends that would have really taken away from the film: Slo-mo is used very sparingly, and the more frenetic action scenes aren't all just quick-cut, shaky-cam, over-edited messes.This leaves us with the villain situation. Timothy Olyphant is a good actor who can really steal a scene in the right role. But here he is only given a couple of really meaty moments to shine, and comparing him to classic villainous actors like Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons is just unfair. So while he does a fine job, his character is not particularly memorable. The rest of the villains are filled out with the usual generic henchman, with the exception of a kung-fu right-hand woman and an overly-acrobatic top thug straight out of a Bond film.Justin Long has always been a fun, underrated actor in my opinion, but again I was worried he'd come across as a lame comic relief sidekick. Yes, he provides a lot of the laughs for the movie, but he is able to do it in a way that seems natural for his character, and it never seems forced. I still hope that his career continues to be successful, and he gets better and better roles. (and yes, his computer in the movie IS a Mac.) I was extremely worried going into this film and had kept my expectations down accordingly. The director and the unthinkable PG-13 rating made everyone go 'huh?' But you really don't even notice. If you didn't already know going in, you'd probably think it was an R. It's always nice to have high hopes for a film and have that film match your expectations, but to go in and be SO pleasantly surprised is a great feeling. I was grinning though half the movie just because I was so thrilled it was living up to the Die Hard name. The action is exciting and even if they went over-the-top in a couple sequences (the F-35 scene is quite far-fetched and feels like it belongs more in a True Lies movie), it never takes you out of the movie. It's just a great action flick.This probably ranks second in the franchise only to the original in my opinion, and has now taken the top spot as my favorite film of the year so far.",9,3,7,5 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Not Quite Perfect
","Do ya like 3-hour battle scenes? You'll love this flick. No, it's not really one battle, but it sure seems that way. Massive battle scene, ten minutes of landscape shots and dialogue. Massive battle scene, ten minutes of landscape shots and dialogue. Repeat. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just think that is what keeps it from being the perfect film that a lot of people are claiming it to be. I know I may get annihilated for actually saying anything less than praise about the Rings trilogy, but I do have a few observations in the negative column:* These films have more sweeping'ooh, look how pretty' landscape shots than a Travel Channel documentary. A good half-hour could be trimmed from each movie right there.* Speaking of trimming, Return of the King takes about half an hour to end... way too much epilogue. And this is after they apparently cut another whole sequence with Saruman at the shire. * More slo-mo than John Woo - which is saying a lot* Why is it orcs and other baddies will fall with one tap of the sword, but the films major characters can run through entire armies without getting the slightest injury?* There's an awful lot of killing of innocent animals here. Those oliphaunts and such are just enslaved! * A lot of people criticize the newer Star Wars films for being nothing but a collection of digital effects. Return of the King is just as guilty as any, with a lot of obvious blue/green screen scenes, and whole battles composed of CGI. I have no problem with that, just want the critics to realize their precious LOTR is just as guilty.* Suddenly raising up an army of the dead, with thousands of soldiers who can't be killed, is a total cop-out. You've suddenly negated all the fighting and deaths the mortals have done. Why didn't someone mention summoning these armies back in the first film!?* The Gollum/Frodo ending was a bit anti-climactic, in my humble opinion.Okay that's enough. Don't get me wrong, I really do like these films, and Return of the King was a good finale. The battles were cool, the acting great across the board, the effects, the music, etc for the most part amazing. As a whole it works pretty well. But I don't think there is a best film in the series. None of them work without the others. But again, that's not a bad thing. I didn't really intend for this review to sound negative. I liked it...really. But every other review in the world is all praise for all the great things about it, so I thought I'd bring up a couple from the 'con' side.",8,0,3,5 July 2007
Pineapple Express," The Weakest of the Apatow Gang Films
","Easily the weakest of the movies from the Apatow gang. Seth Rogen and James Franco both do fine jobs at portraying their characters, but this one just fails in the writing. The movie is actually quite dull, and all but the two main characters are fairly lame. The story is simply not engaging and individual scenes aren't even funny on their own. And what is the deal with Danny McBride?!? He's not the slightest bit funny, but suddenly he's getting all these featured roles. Let's hope he disappears as fast he appeared on the scene. Maybe it's funny if you watch it while high yourself. But for the rest of us, it's just humorless and boring.",4,12,23,14 August 2008
