It," About as bad as the original
","You'd think they could have come up with a marginally better movie if they were going to bother with the time and expense of remaking the original but no. Cartoonish fake looking special effects, so-so acting, the same actor from Stranger Things in a setting that might as well be an episode of stranger things, cheap jump-scares, and it went on so long that I fell asleep for a lot of the boring ending. Also the clown wasn't scary in the first movie but was somehow made even less scary in the second movie.",2,1,2,13 July 2018
