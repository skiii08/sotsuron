The New World," Horrible
","This is one the worst movies I've ever seen. The rating on this site for this movie in unbelievable. I watch this movie all the way through unfortunately. I waited for something to happen that would entertain just a little bit. Of course that never happened. If you read any other review and it has something good to say about this piece of garbage film, don't believe a word of it. I hate the fact that the lowest score I can give this movie is a 1. I would rate it a negative 10 if possible. This movie is not only lacking in entertain value it is just weird. The way it flashes around the director uses constantly changing camera angles makes a piece of poop even worse.",1,1,10,27 July 2007
