Ford v Ferrari," Ford vs. Ferrari
","Indeed a watch worth the wait. Nail-biting drama and an out-and-out edge-of-the-seat experience one could possibly want in a Christian Bale and Matt Damon starrer. And the sound effects!!!! Gosh!!! Truly exhilarating and fascinating work of art displayed by the sound design team. Perhaps watching it in IMAX just added to the experience tenfold. Bale was as stupendous as could be; possibly one of the best we've seen him in in quiet a while. Damon was no less astounding in his own right.
It won't be wrong to say that one of its greatest technical achievements lies in the fact that you don't necessarily have to be a 'car-guy' to be able to commend this marvel. Another commendable fact was that despite being based on a true story, it had us giving a slight feeling of unpredictability at points, which was, in fact, a sight to behold. Also, in spite of being a tad bit long, it never even seemed to lose grip of the plot.The monstrous sound of the roaring engines could be felt throughout the entirety of the theatre, so even if a 'non-car-guy' feels bored, these blaring sounds won't let him sleep. The final act was a bit of a let-down which was not what I expected to be the outcome.
All-in-all a feature rife with intensity, emotions, breakdowns (technical and emotional) and an over-the-top sound design which suffices for an individual to enable him to say that he is a member of such a cinephilic community that prides itself on being able to witness such level of filmmaking. Long live cinema!!!",8,2,3,2 December 2019
