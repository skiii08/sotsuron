Hereditary," The perfect horror film. If you like horror at all. Just watch it
",This is the best horror film I would say in past few years but I really enjoyed the ritual on Netflix and if you count a quiet place I loved that too. But this movie is really perfectly paced. Some may complain it's slow in the first half but if the first half didn't set the eerie tone and give the characters depth you would not feel the emotion for them as strongly. The mothers performance is Oscar worthy. I mean she's incredibly talented in this movie. Charlie is the perfect creepy kid. I hope this movie blows up and gets shared for everyone to see as me finding it was a freak accident. I had never even heard of it or seen previews. Don't even watch previews. Go in knowing nothing but it's a supernatural horror not unlike the witch or the ritual on Netflix. Don't think about it. Watch it.,10,13,25,23 August 2018
Logan," Why are people giving this one star????? Its rated R people, stop complaining of violence.
","This was a great movie in general, and was definitely the best xmen  movie yet.  This movie was the ONLY xmen movie that actually had deep emotion and  character development, and actually invoked emotion in me as a viewer.  It was what i always wanted from an xmen movie. To be done right, and  taken seriously.",9,6,15,15 May 2017
