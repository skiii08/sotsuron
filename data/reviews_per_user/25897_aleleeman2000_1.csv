The Legend of Bagger Vance," Great Movie!!!!!
","One of the best movies I've ever seen. You'll want to see this one with loved ones and then be sure and discuss it with friends - a great teaching tool, if held in the right hands. Try not to preach or moralize though, some people may just enjoy it for the 'feel good' qualities, of which there are many!! See it, enjoy it and spread the word. Your friends will appreciate it!! I find it truly amazing that good direction from good directors seems to elicit such stellar performances from the actors that are chosen. I think you'll find the role of Bagger Vance by Will Smith a big change of pace for him, and one that he carries off beautifully. The only complaint that I personally could find with this movie was the omission of Jack Lemmon in the credits. I believe this was his last role? (great news for trivia buffs if its right!)",10,0,1,15 April 2007
