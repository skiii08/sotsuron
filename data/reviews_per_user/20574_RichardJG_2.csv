Requiem for a Dream," Stunning cinematic experience
","A film that is both exceedingly dark but visually stunning, ultra stylish yet with an emotional undercurrent encapsulated in the marvelous Ellen Burstyn. Also a quite marvellous soundtrack featuring Clint Marshall / Kronos Quartet. One of the greatest films ever made. Go see.",10,0,0,6 June 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Badly scripted, plodding, boring
","And where did all the money go - two big cgi action scenes - where did the budget go?Minimal sets, unexplained plot points , endless meetings, cliched battle speeches, cliched dialogue, cliches cliches etc etcAlmost as bad as Attack of the Clones.Very underwhelming.",1,0,1,6 November 2003
