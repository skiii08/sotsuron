Insidious: Chapter 2," Just another amazing spine-tingling movie
","Just another amazing spine-tingling movie. The casting was awesome, the characters were truly awesome and the movie ended up with a great twist....Patrick Wilson as Josh Lambert acted marvelously in the film. After you watch the movie, you finally get to know that Josh was actually not 'JOSH LAMBERT' after his soul came back last time when he tried to bring back his son Dalton Lambert(Ty Simpkins) in the first part.And even you cannot forget Elise Rainier(Lin Shaye) who let the twist happen at the end.Tyler James Griffin as Young Parker Crane also acted brilliantly.Also cannot forget Tucker(Angus Sampson) and Specs(Leigh Whannell) for their excellent effort.Other Characters & Special Role:-Andrew Astor as Foster Lambert(Dalton's Brother) Rose Byrne as Renai Lambert(Dalton's & Fosters' Mother) Barbara Hershey as Lorraine Lambert(Josh's Mother)",10,1,2,12 March 2014
