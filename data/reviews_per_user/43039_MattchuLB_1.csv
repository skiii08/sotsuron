The Blair Witch Project," The Scariest Movie That I Have Ever Seen!!! (*May Contain Minor Spoiler*)
","This movie was extremely scary! After viewing this film, I just sat there and thought, Oh, My, God. I was scared out of my mind! Along with the other person that I watched it with.It just kept going through our minds, those poor kids. We lost a night of sleep over this darn movie!!!But it was still a great movie.But be prepared for some heavy cussing!I think that there is like, 130 F-words.Also beware of unsteady camera movements! But when you get caught up in the movie the cussing and wobbling of the camera don't really bother you that much.If you wish to get the daylight scared out of you, Then watch this film.Highly recommended! My rating 10 out of ten stars. Rated R For: Strong LanguageThank you for taking the time to read my comment and I hope that you enjoy the movie.",10,2,6,7 June 2006
