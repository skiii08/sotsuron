Howl's Moving Castle," Wow
","Note: Possible Spoilers I gave this movie a 10 out of 10, so I should warn you ahead of time that I loved this movie completely. My husband and I saw this movie last night on our 'date night' and just were blown away. I've read reviews where folks think that this movie is not as good as the other Studio Ghibli movies (we have almost all of them) and so we were wary. Frankly, this turned out to be such a great date movie! It was truly a love story, and I believe that this was the first of Studio Ghibli's true love stories. At least it seems to be the only one of it's kind in English.The best part of this movie happens when Howl introduces Sophie to a wildflower swept field, which is Howl's own personal space, and is a memory from his childhood. At that point, my husband and I were completely immersed in the world that Ghibli once again wonderfully and almost magically created. Believe me, when you reach that point in the movie, you will be 'spirited away.' Pun intended. We will purchase this movie when it is released on DVD, and cannot wait to watch this movie again and again. Our children love Miyazaki's movies, and as well they should...he never has disappointed us.",10,7,10,23 July 2005
Underworld," Loved it!
","I am honestly amazed at some of the comments made about thismovie on imdb.  I loved this movie.  We bought it sight unseen andwe've seen it nightly since.  It's a good movie, not too deep, simplyfun to watch.  And frankly Bekinsale is elegant in the way shemoves in the fight scenes.  Very graceful.  I saw/read where shehas a dancer's background, and it shows.  But in a good way.  Ijust watched the movie again today when my toddler napped.  AndI'll see it again probably by the close of this week.  It's a fun movie. And I don't agree that it's a rip off of Matrix.  The Matrix ripped offother movies in the second and third versions of it's franchise!  [sothere]  If you want to see a good sci-fi movie, then see this movie. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel of Underworld when itarrives in 2005.  Good luck in advance Kate Wiseman!  :))  Go kicksome butt.  Your new husband will guaranteed make you lookgreat while leaping tall buildings in a single bound...wait...wrongmovie.  :))",8,2,3,18 May 2004
Spider-Man 2," Spectacular
","My family and I were completely blown away by this movie.  I'veread where this movie is better than the original, and I absolutelyagree with this.  The only concern I have is for young children.  Wetook my 2 year old to this movie, and she was scared by somepoints, but not many at all.  My 8 year old loved it completely, so itwas fine for her.  This is a movie with heart, and excellent far above parcinematography.  I mean it, the filming is just streamless andbreathtaking at points.  The way the camera captures the actor'sexpressions, and then pans out as if impacted by the blow of theactor's emotions...wow!  Whoever did the editing and overallcinematography just did an outstanding job.  And Mary Jane andPeter Parker!  There were scenes where I literally cried.  I'dwatched Dunst in an interview where she called the filming'beautiful' and I for one agree with her.  Sam Raimi [with his friendBruce Campbell once again making a great appearance] reallyseemed to balance the ironic/funny interludes of life with the rawemotion of Parker's sacrifice of his life and hope and happinessand dreams...all because he has made a choice to save others.  Ilove the part where others literally support the character of SpiderMan.  And I love the ending where the statement is made about'who saves Peter Parker?'.Just some lovely moments in this film.  That's what lifted thismovie from the simple action/adventure hype of the Summerdraws.  This movie has those too, by the way.  But what the other action/adventure movies don't have is the heartand great character development that this film brings brilliantly tothe big screen.  I've always admired how Stan Lee intricately developed hischaracters, drawing us into their fictional lives and personalstories...along with the fights with the villains of course!  And SamRaimi continues this tradition wonderfully.  I gave this movie a 9 out of 10.  I would recommend it for anyone,with special consideration given to the very young [i.e., think twicebefore taking a toddler like we unwisely did].  The movie movedalong at a brisk pace, and was wonderfully written.  We cannot wait for Spider Man 3!",9,0,0,1 July 2004
Van Helsing," Not a good movie!
","My husband and I saw this movie, and people actually laughed when Anna's brother died. Then, when Anna and her family appeared in the clouds at the end of the picture, people laughed so hard, you could hardly hear the end of the movie. This movie was that cheesy. It was sad, as my husband and I were both so excited to see this movie. It was the first date movie we've seen in months. Very sad. I would not waste my time on this movie again. We won't be buying this movie, we won't see any sequels, and we wish we'd chosen to find where Hellboy was playing so we could have at least seen something that was ranked as good. We'd give this movie a 3 out of 10. Even the CGI was so fake, and so contrived, it just didn't bring the movie up in our esteem at all. And we love Hugh Jackman and just purchased Kate Beckingsale/Wiseman's movie 'Underworld' and love her in that. We'll see future Underworlds, and will probably even buy Hellboy sight unseen, but will never see this franchise again. Boo.",3,1,1,17 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," EH...ho hum
","My family saw this movie...my husband and two young children. There were scary parts of this movie that my toddler did not like atall, so first off be wary of taking very young children to this movie. My 8 year old loved the movie.  We've seen the first two moviesprobably 40 times each [no joke]...we are huge fans of the booksand movies.  This movie was really hyped by critics who didn't like the firstmovies.  Frankly, I was hyped myself to see the third installment,as I had hoped for an edgier film.  It is an edgier film.  But most ofthe camera angles left me feeling as if I'd just watched a homemovie...you know how you get that feeling of vertigo?  Sort ofmotion sickness?  That's what I came away with, and found outlater that my eldest child and husband came away that way too. So, be forewarned.  If you are a 'slave to the story' the way Rowling wrote it, you will bedisappointed.  There are scenes in it that are completely rewritingthe book.  Many things were cut out.  And I can respect that, due tothe sheer length of Rowling's recent HP books.  Understandableindeed.  However, it seems that a little too much trimming tookplace, and part of the joy of watching the characters interact waslost.  And I suppose in a sad way that's how it will continue giventhe length of the following HP books.  If they are to be adapted tothe screen, cutting will have to be done.  Also, did it strike anyone else as odd that the characters,especially 'Harry Potter' himself Daniel Radcliffe, grew so quickly? His physical growth was really representative of the othercharacters quick physical growth as well....many actors grewconsiderably from a physical standpoint.  And then it hit me...thiswhole series will be over so quickly...and then they will be nomore.  What will we ever do without Harry Potter and that wonderfulworld that Rowling created.  Frankly, she is a master at characterdevelopment, and I'll miss that when she writes her last on thisseries.  All the things you read/hear about this movie are true:  The movieis edgier, darker, more mature in nature, and downright scarier foryounger children.  Something wicked this way comes....and I wish it would havestayed around a little longer.  I gave it a 6 out of 10.  The filming left something to be desired.  Alittle too much liberty taken with the actual story.  Not enoughcharacter development where you actually cared for the charactersthis time around.  And the background renderings left you wantingto hurl at particular points.  Go and see it.  Just leave yourexpectations lower than before with the other two.  And let's praythat they don't fire the younger actors for looking too 'old.'",6,1,1,5 June 2004
Resident Evil," Yuck
","What I mean by 'yuck' in the subject line is the yuck of the film, notthe useless slugs/zombies.  Zombies...what makes them sospecial?  This movie played out like a video game, but a really badvideo game that you immediately regret buying or renting or seeingon the big screen.  We bought this DVD in a package deal withHellboy.  Hellboy was good, but this one is such a stinker, Iwouldn't give this to anybody as a 'gift.'  My husband refused tosee it, as he just thinks the whole premise is stupid.  I do too, butwas curious.  And I'm so sorry for that.  Don't waste your time.   Ithought the whole writing was terrible, and the acting!!!  Goodness! These people just didn't get it.  And the director?  Somebody justglue him to a chair and force him to watch this dang thingrepeatedly until he apologizes.  Yuck.",3,0,0,13 August 2004
Hellboy," Overall good action film
","My husband and I bought this DVD sight unseen.  We were verycurious about this one for ages, but never got a chance to see it onthe big screen.  We liked it.  This movie is not an amazing out ofthe park epic, but we would like to see this franchise in the future. Pearlman was really good in this film, and he really held his own. Overall, the writing was not what I had hoped for.  And it could haveended sooner.  At the end, it just kept going and going.  Which isfine.  But editing could have helped this film.  Del Torro, what tosay?  Frankly, I'm not a fan.  Blade 2 turned my stomach....toomuch needless gore and such blood, it just went overboard.  Atthat point I swore that I'd never see another Del Torro film.  Blade 2just made me ill...and I adored the first film totally.  So, for me tobuy Hellboy...well, it was a leap of faith.  And I'm glad I took it.  Ibought it in a two pack of DVD's...and the other?  Resident Evil? Well...that's another review.  In summary, buy Hellboy, or rent it.  It'spretty good.  Not great.  But pretty good.",7,0,1,13 August 2004
Shrek 2," Bit of a disappointment
","I have two young children, and have probably seen the originalShrek 40-50 times.  We were very excited about seeing this movie. This movie was really hyped by other critics/reviewers, and so Ijust gleefully entered the movie theater, with high hopes.  Maybethat was the issue.  But this movie really did not live up to theoriginal.  It was almost too stuffed with funny anecdotes.  It wasmanic in pace, and when a coffee-holic makes a comment likethat...well...let's just say I usually am very alert.  The pace was alittle too much for me.  I wasn't as thrilled with the second movie asthe first.  But overall, it was a good movie.  I still gave it a 6 out of10.  The writing was great, but not excellent like the first movie. The story line was great, but not excellent like the first movie.  Thescenery was excellent, and it was really better than the first movie. The landscapes were really lush.  One of the things I was lookingforward to was the clever music, and with the exception of the fairygodmother's song, it was a let down.  Overall, please do go andsee the movie.  I would recommend it.  It's great, but not asexcellent as...well...yep...you guessed it...the first movie.  So, aslong as we're clear on that, then I've done my job.  God bless useveryone.",6,0,0,22 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Excellent Start
","I have an 8 year old daughter and niece, and they both love theHarry Potter books and films.  I've watched this movie probably 50times [not kidding] and it's just a good film.  When I watch thesecond movie, I love going back to the first movie to see how thechildren have grown so quickly!  We all cannot wait for the thirdfilm, and will be taking our 2 year old daughter to the theater aswell.  We all love the films here.  The DVD has some interestinggames on them, and my eldest daughter loves to play them.  I justthink that JK Rowling did a fine job creating and molding thesecharacters and allowing them to grow with each book.  I've read allof them.  I'm 35, and cannot wait for the next book!  Or movie!",8,0,1,24 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Very Good
","I first saw this movie in a movie theater, and then bought it on DVD. My husband and I were the first of our family to see this movie, to preview it for our children (ages 10 and 4). I'm a huge fan of the books, and highly recommend them to anyone who loves to watch a character grow through a series of novels. I have to write, first of all, that I miss Columbus as the director. His vision of Harry's world was beautiful. And that's probably the main issue with why Warner Brothers went with another director for these 'darker' movies further on in the Harry Potter series. I also understand that Rowling really enjoyed how the director Newell crafted this movie, and agreed with what he had to cut out.The primary scene I was looking forward to being adapted from the book was the quidditch match for the world cup. Overall, it was a short and sweet adaptation. But from that point on, you really just need to hold onto your seat/couch, as this movie takes off at super sonic pace. Again, where is the lovely banter between the characters? Where is the character development? Because of that same pace, that concern to pack into the movie as much of the story as possible, the director seems to have missed that central element of the Harry Potter franchise: the characters and their relationships to one another.How will Harry and Dumbledore ever get together in terms of having their pivotal scenes in the latest book (Half Blood Prince)? How can anyone buy into these two characters growing with each other? We know Harry cares for Dumbledore and is loyal to him, but beyond that, do we even sense from the movies that Dumbledore cares more for him than any other student? This relationship is something that we know about from the books, and feel their bond so well due to Rowling and her craftsmanship. However, as far as the latest movies are concerned, we don't get that sense at all. And how about the 3 main relationships between Ron, Hermione and Harry? We rarely get to see that at all.Another note: I have never shown the Voldemort scene (the one of his rebirth) to our children. Neither child is at the point where she could watch this scene and not come away from it with nightmares. I agree that it needed to be in the movie, but be forewarned. Children do not need to see this scene. Probably one scene I would have cut from the movie was the scene where Moody teaches his first class and manipulates a spider. It's gruesome and unnecessary. Especially if you view it repeatedly on DVD...which we have done, and we usually skip that scene as well, at the request of our children. As Harry and this franchise ages, parents please be prepared. Some scenes will not be viewable by children, and parents should always preview these movies prior to letting their children view them. MPAA has rated this movie as PG-13 for a reason. And I'm sure each HP movie from this point on will have the same rating. As the fake Moody says, 'Constant Vigilance!'And from what I understand, Oldman will not be back for Order of the Pheonix. So, once again, how will moviegoers actually get to see Harry and his 'father figure' Black interact with each other? Again, this is a pivotal relationship for Harry.Overall, this movie is good. But it could have been far better with better editing. This movie wasn't seamless in the least.",8,3,5,4 July 2006
Dodgeball," Eh...
","First of all, if you have any feelings of political correctness aboutyou, then you will not like this movie.  If you are open minded andlike screwball comedy, then this movie is for you.  If you have sometwinges of PC and still like screwball comedies, then you'd be likeI am...feeling a bit ambivalent about this movie.  A word to the wise:  stay until after the last credits roll to seeanother scene of the movie with Ben Stiller.  I covered my eyes andonly peeked through a couple of times...it was raunchy.  Myhusband?  Well, he laughed so hard I thought he'd have to gorunning to the bathroom.One couple in front of us [the PC types???] left after the first fiveminutes.  And I guarantee you they asked for their money back. 
The rest of the sparse crew in the theater stayed for the full monty,and mostly laughed.  Some jokes fell quite flat.  This movie has a ton of jokes in them, one right after the other, andyou really don't get a chance to breathe much less laugh at themall.  The basic premise of the movie is how an underdog can chooseto rule the day, if they push themselves hard enough andovercome their own personal demons.  I loved that basic story line,and I think that's why I'd ultimately recommend it.  Not highlyrecommend it, mind you.  I'd recommend either tossing the bucksaway to see it once at the theater, or buying it when it comes out onDVD if you like screwball comedies.  I gave it a 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,2 July 2004
