Deja Vu," What if you had to tell someone the most important thing in the world, but you knew they'd never believe you?
","Deja Vu is a very interesting take on the time travel spectrum directors, writers, and producers alike are all interested in. Tony Scott (Man on Fire, Enemy of the State) once again goes with Denzel Washington to boost his movie. If it weren't for Denzel's superb acting, I'd give the movie a 7. Putting aside the silly time-travel lingo tossed around throughout, the movie itself has strong performances and good action/suspense...that's all if you're able to set aside the time travel idea. It IS a pretty far-fetched way to do the whole time travel thing. I didn't find the techno jargon too difficult to grasp/understand from an intuitive aspect, but I have watched this with my family and I had to give a run-down on what they were talking about. I understand, some explaining is needed, but Tony may have extended the details a tad bit too far. I like how he makes Denzel just as confused as viewers are, and realistically Denzel doesn't grasp the science stuff easily. That was a good touch. Denzel actually probably wasn't even acting too much during that part, because he sounded genuinely confused. Denzel is a question man in this movie, and boy he was great in this movie. I love a good Denzel role (which I'm sure most of you do too), and his character is basically the reason this movie did well at the box office, and the reason I (along with many others) bought the DVD. So, the whole time, Denzel and co. are trying to figure out (via intelligent global survey satellite) who really blew up the New Orleans ferry boat packed full of Navy officers and civilians alike (which is shown at the beginning of the movie). In the process, gorgeous new comer Paula Patton is tossed in the mix of the whole bomb act, and thus Denzel forms an attachment to her, and is determined to protect her from what she doesn't know awaits her.The movie is really a romantic action thriller. The sci-fi aspect is overshadowed by a very strong performance by Mr. Washington. I think as viewers, you'll really enjoy this movie a lot by putting aside the sci-fi aspect and watching it for its suspense and thrills. I think Tony should stray away from trying to do far-fetched sci-fi from here on out and just stick to his high-octane action thrillers...and use Denzel because as far as Im concerned, he's one of the strongest actors in Hollywood as of now. Pretty good plot, decent sci-fi aspect, great thrills, and awesome performances make up this movie. I'm Will Black and that's my review of Deja Vu 8/10",8,0,1,30 April 2007
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," A review from the eyes of the loyal boyfriend
","Being the loyal boyfriend that I am, I gladly accompanied my lady to see the latest Twilight movie. That is, of course, after I got to spend money on dugout seats at the Braves game and got her to go see A-Team with me. Twice. So, before I saw Eclipse, I decided it was a good idea to watch the other two. Well, I had seen the second one with her last year but re-watched it as well as watched the first one for the first time. I was prepared; stocked full of Twilight trivia and know-how. The first two movies were OK. The thing I enjoyed most about them was how I could easily relate to being heartbroken at that age, and the amazing location in Washington state near Seattle. Seattle is my favorite city. New Moon was a bit too melodramatic for my tastes, but nonetheless offered a decent narrative on teen angst. I've been there, haven't we all?So, with Eclipse I expected improvement. And what did I get?Lots of improvement! It was actually an enjoyable movie. Being one of (I counted) four males in the audience, I had to cover my ears (at least it felt like it) every time werewolf boy Jake showed up with his shirt off...which was literally about 90% of the time he was in a scene. I had never read the books, so I was upset at how many girls are 'team Jacob' or whatever. I am an old-fashioned fellow myself and believe in loyalty and all that good stuff. So, the whole 'I love Eddie boy, but I also love Jake...just not as much as Edward' stuff that Bella kept pulling kinda annoyed me. You could tell that the younger girls were all for Jacob...the macho, buff hott guy while the older women were for Edward...the loyal, quiet, old-fashioned guy. Anyway...the fight scene! Yes the fight scene...it was pretty cool. Especially the fight between Victoria and Edward. It got pretty intense. I won't spoil all those goodies though. The surprise star of the movie was definitely Jackson Rathbone. You got a nice little backstory on the fella that seemed pretty hidden in the first two films. His southern accent came out of nowhere though. I mean, that was a little forced. He was in the Confederate Army in Texas during the civil war when he became a blood-sucker...and when he was telling the story to Bella his accent started coming out of nowhere. But, he really did get some good air time which was solid. He took his 15 minutes and put them to good use. Bravo, chap. Overall, this movie was an enjoyable more realistic (er...you know what I mean here) movie than the other two. Bella isn't as awkward, and Edward is actually IN the movie this time. Taylor Lautner did a lot better acting this time. Everyone's acting was a lot better. I don't know really much about what happens in the next installment, but from someone who doesn't read the books and went to be a good boyfriend...it was good fun. So, if you're a guy dreading going with your girl...don't be scared. It's actually pretty good.",7,2,9,8 July 2010
