Skyfall," Can it fall any lower?
","I'm not one to give single star ratings just to lower an IMDb average, but I was really tempted in this case. I have never seen so many plot holes and idiotic, contrived twists in such an expensive production before. With so many brilliant screenwriters in Hollywood, one just has to wonder how they could screw this up so badly. The premise was cool, the execution terrible. Suspending disbelief is one thing, being asked to ignore your brain completely is another. Great job guys, the way this is going, the next Bond film will only be watchable by school children. Even the action scenes were boring, but that wouldn't matter, if the film wasn't riddled with so many 'Come on now, why?' moments. To top everything off, you have the least desirable Bond girl of all time and a Mannipeni you couldn't care less for.",4,12,24,20 June 2013
Inglourious Basterds," The first IMDb disappointment ever
","I don't usually trust reviews and ratings, but IMDb had never failed me, until now. I used to think that enough intelligent people vote over time, to get the rating about right. I've changed my mind.I don't care one bit about the brilliant performance of the SS officer, the colors, the pace, or the jokes. The message is so disturbingly wrong, that it trumps any of the positive aspects of this piece of trash. If over 90% of the people who watched the film can not see anything wrong with it, then this world is certainly doomed.I have enjoyed many of Tarantino's films, regardless of the violence. Up until now, the violence was due to personal and largely justified revenge, or part of the character of very sick individuals. Putting Vermacht foot soldiers in the same basket with SS and Gestapo officers is just plain wrong. I wonder how this film would be rated if it were about a Palestinian squad scalping Jews or marking their foreheads with the star of David. These issues are not to be trifled with. Not all Germans were Nazis deserving the wrath of Jehovah. Any attempt at generalizations about a large group of people should be condemned, first of all by the Jewish people, who know what discrimination and persecution is. Hateful films like this would barely make it as war-time propaganda and you hail it as one of the best films of all time? I would like to tell you what I think of you, but I bet my review would not make it through the editors, so I will simply suggest you watch it again after you've grown up.",1,41,79,11 March 2010
