Marie Antoinette," Beautiful..
","This is such a wonderful artistic film. Sofia Coppola nails it down and succeeds. This is a great film that shows you Marie Antoinette from her own view. Not from the people in Versaille. From the start you can feel her pain and her longing to escape and just be a regular girl. Being a Queen isn't a walk in the park as portrayed many times. She was young and too young to reign... and as said in the film ' God guide us and protect us, we are too young to reign' and this is said by Jason Shwartzman. The acting is phenomenal! Kirsten Dunst was perfect for the role and Jason Shwartzman was great also. I loved the movie but I gave this a 8 out of 10 because, even though i love Sofia's view and direction, the story has elements where it's confusing and at times you don't know why something is happening. I know this movie just directs on Marie Antoinette but at times i'd liked to know what was going on. But overall I enjoyed it immensely!! Go and see it!!!!",8,2,5,22 October 2006
Hostel," Physiological Scares
","Recently I picked up Hostel at my local movie store and decided to give it a try. I finished watching it and had very mixed feelings. First off, this film is not nearly as gory and disgusting as advertised. It is although, very graphic, and NOT for the squeamish, I just expected more out of it. The pop-up scares aren't effective and the first half of the movie is all soft-core porn. So what makes this movie a decent horror movie? The physiological scares. That is what got to me. The overwhelming feeling of being tied and up and tortured to death. Having no escape. For that was very effective and stomach curdling. The sex and nudity was all not needed, but for people looking for that kind of stuff, it's all here. The acting was pretty good. No bad performances. Hostel is a kind of movie where you'll either love it or hate it. But overall, an OK horror film. Not my favorite, but not terrible.",6,41,63,15 October 2007
Lost in Translation," I Can't Get Enough Of This Movie!
","I love Lost In Translation! There is so much emotion and beauty, and it's so unique and original. There has never been another movie that's made me feel a certain way, each and every time I view it. The themes of friendship and finding yourself are all apparent in everyone's lives at one point, and you can really relate to it. The more serious tones of the movie and the beautiful cinematography are gorgeous and really leave a mark after the movie is over. It is ranked up there as my favorite movie next to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind! The acting is truly amazing. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are perfect for their roles and could not have done a better job! Bill plays the depressed actor pitch perfect with his usual quirky humor along the way. Scarlett is incredible as the young woman questioning her marriage and trying to find herself along the way. She really brings a sophisticated kind of sexiness to the role. The music is probably one of my favorites. It conveys the movie's themes beautifully. If you ever get a chance, go out and see this movie. The originality, acting, directing, musical score, photography, and themes all shine during the movie and even after the movie is over! 10/10",10,3,6,18 June 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," Very Good Remake!
","Here it is, usually remakes are horrible. Usually nothing is as great as the original. I wasn't expecting a full throttle horror freak out but I wasn't expecting a cheap piece of trash. Lets just say that The Hills Have Eyes totally changed my perspective on remakes! This movie was insane! Great scares, good gore, sweat breaking suspense, and a terrifying storyline. The brilliant thing about The Hills Have Eyes is that you care for the characters and through every scene your cheering them on to kill those creatures. You can feel their pain through every scene and that just makes the movie even better. This is not for the weak stomach, there is definitely some disturbing content. But if your in to these kind of movies and you can handle gore and some big entertainment, scares, thrills, and suspense. Then you will definitely enjoy The Hills Have Eyes.",8,1,2,2 February 2007
Disturbia," I Loved it!!
","Disturbia was very suspenseful and intense, but also added great comedic moments, which I think was a great mix. In Disturbia, you never know whats going to happen and all the cast were amazing. Not one bad performance. Disturbia is unique because compared to some recent PG-13 horror flicks, this one is very suspenseful and has an excellent story. All the characters have their own personality and are likable, so you do care about them and their fate. There are some jumpy scenes, but the tension mostly comes from suspense and not knowing whats gonna happen next. Is Disturbia going to be called one of the most scariest films ever? No. But will it entertain you and give you a good time? Yes. When I say, entertaining and a good time, I don't mean a terrible movie but with good gore, and cheesy popcorn scenes that are only mean't to be viewed with a group of friends. When I say entertaining and a good time, I mean that Disturbia has great suspense, is very intense, likable characters, and a bone chilling plot. Disturbia does not need to be a bad movie, to be a good movie. Disturbia may be similar to Rear Window but do not ruin your experience by comparing them and calling this a rip off. You will like this movie if you go and expect a movie of its own. Like I said, Disturbia is a great movie. Go and see it and have a good time.",8,2,9,14 April 2007
Spirited Away," A Wonderful Film.
","Spirited Away is a very strange yet wonderful film, with elements extremely bizarre. But there's something about it that makes it so magical. The characters are beyond hard to figure out and the storyline goes everywhere. You never know what's going to happen. Whenever I watch this, afterward, the movie sticks with me, and I think about it for a while, trying to establish a certain connection. But the connection was always there, its just putting it together. All the characters are very diverse and interesting. Spirited Away is a very good movie with an extreme amount of growth with all the characters, and maybe even the viewer themselves. Not my favorite movie of all time, but it deserves a standing ovation, and even more. 10/10",10,1,3,16 October 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," My Favorite Movie! The Most Beautiful! Dreamy! and Wonderful Movie Of The Year!
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was by far, in my opinion, the best movie of 2004. It makes you feel grateful for who you have in your life. There were also so many different genres that it's impossible to place it in just one. Comedy, mystery, and drama, all wonderful elements of the movie. When you're finished watching this, the utmost joy, love, wonder, and thankfulness is completely drowned upon you. The story is absolutely magical and the acting was phenomenal! All of this deserved many Academey Awards! Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are very gifted actors, and Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson all did incredible as well! Out of any movie I recommend this, because it makes you feel so many different emotions in only a short amount of time. Eternal Sunshine is a very poignant, dreamy, and mysterious movie of love and memories.",10,1,4,15 October 2007
Grindhouse," Brilliant Entertainment at the Movies!!
","Planet Terror and Death Proof are todays back to back grind house motion pictures. Grindhouse is a cinema which played back to back movies which were generally a shocker. The movies would be pushed past the limit to guarantee entertainment and usually involve explicit violence, sex, language, and other extreme material. The movies weren't much but they'd be sure to entertain you! Planet Terror was directed by Robert Rodriguez. It's amazing! I've never been so entertained with the explosive action or the experiencing of the shocking jaw dropping sensation from the frequent shocker. Planet Terror is sure to please. Action, humor, and gore are in millions! Rodriguez does a great job keeping you very entertained. Planet Terror does what a grind house motion picture is supposed to do and more! 9/10The in between trailers were hysterical and made a great addition to the movies! The best trailer for me would be either, Thanksgiving or Machete. Both of these are eye catchers, especially Thanksgiving =] They both were shocking and fun. 8.5/10 Death Proof is the second film directed by Quentin Tarantino. I love Tarantino's works, Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, etc. Kurt Russel is incredible and is perfect for the villain. He catches your eye and is generally creepy as well. The story for Death Proof is very creative and the action scenes were really intense and suspenseful. I love how the film builds up, like all Tarantino films do, but when you reach the climax you get one hell of an adrenaline fueled, heart racing, scream your lungs out terror. Total kick ass. Death Proof definitely tops as one of Tarantino's best, and also does what Grindhouse is supposed to do. It's genius! 9/10In conclusion, I recommend seeing Grindhouse, it's INCREDIBLE! If you are in to this kind of stuff, you will have a blast! Grindhouse brings something totally new to today's cinema thats sure to bring audiences screaming for more. Only at THE GRINDHOUSE. 9/10",9,0,1,12 June 2007
The Descent," Terrifying!
","The Descent truly scared the hell out of me. I'm a huge horror fanatic and I don't usually get scared when it comes to scary movies now a days, but I have to admit that The Descent actually brought heart pounding fear as I sat there in the theater. To prove that point, this was the first horror movie that I watched in the theater that actually made me scream. I love that The Descent isn't just about the creatures but the relationships between the characters, as well as the claustrophobic, tightened up feeling you get when they're inside the cave. Sure the creatures freaked me out, but The Descent didn't stop there and that's what I like about it. The Descent is the BEST and SCARIEST horror film of the twentieth century. It's that good. 10/10",9,2,5,20 August 2006
Halloween," One Of The Best Horror Movies Of All Time!
","Halloween is definitely one of the best and scariest horror film ever in my opinion. It is extremely creepy and bone chilling. Watching this in pitch black in the middle of the night will guarantee difficulty getting to sleep. If your looking for perfect horror, this is for you. Now, there are some people who may not like it. Gorehounds and other fans looking for 'gnarly and insane' horror. Or in other word, recent hard R scary movies, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (still a good movie), The Hills Have Eyes, Hostel, and other gory flicks. No, if your only looking for movies like those, this won't work for you. But if your looking for genuine horror, keep reading. This movie isn't superbly intense or bloody, but it is very creepy and suspenseful creating the overall scare level to the max. I enjoyed it very much and according to the IMDb rating, so did a lot of people. Who can blame them? This movie deserves the rating, as well as the occasional nightmares to come with. As a die-hard horror fan, Halloween is placed on the shelves of horror's glory. Go watch it, see for yourself. It's perfect.",10,3,5,29 October 2007
