Requiem for a Dream," A swingeing blow in the midriff
","From the very moment you sink into your chair and switch on 'Requiem For A Dream', you become a passenger on of the most intense and frightful rides into the living hell of drugs. With his second movie, Darren Aronofsky hits you in the stomach so it hurts with a drama so real depicted, it works as much more than just a wake-up call to how the satisfactory inebriation of drugs can degenerate to inhuman and depraving fates. The actors, the performance of Ellen Burstyn in particular, are more or less convincing to the max. 'Requiem' means originally 'mass for a departed soul' (hence: everything). The cinematography, dialogue, settings and lighting... everything is excellent for its purpose; to make you feel sick. Towards the end, Aronofsky  dazzles the viewer with well composed back and forth sequences, ready to slay the entire audience one by one... with this evil drug nightmare.  The cinematic experience itself, cannot be put to words. You would have to see it for yourself. Recommended to everyone. A true and healthy movie of the reality.whiplash-",Null,0,0,20 July 2001
American Pie," A minimum flop.
","This movie has to be called a total blunder. Although enjoyed by an inconceivably large amount of teenagers, American Pie has an immensely great lack of filmmaking and talent. It combines wretched humor, a contemptuous plot, and superficial characters without common sense. What's the point? American Pie is a rather embarrassing affair with its pathetic humor and minimum 'comedic' tone. I find it hard to believe its huge boxoffice success. The movie, however, had one bright gleam; Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs as father and son, whose performances were delightful.My conclusion is, after having suffered through the full duration, don't EVER waste your precious time on this film. It's crap. The only reason I ever saw it, was to be able to declare about it.",Null,0,1,25 April 2001
True Romance," Plain and simple a marvellous movie!
","This is just a fantastic movie. It's constantly amusing, and combines beautiful, compact violence with an incredible love story, which engages the viewer to the max. True Romance evolves quickly thoroughly the whole movie. In a matter of minutes, Clarence Worley and Alabama are married. The turning points are made with excellent precision. The music, the cast, and the atmosphere that True Romance delivers, is just a breakthrough for any modern love story committed to the screen today. Patricia Arquette, Christian Slater, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini and Dennis Hopper are all highly worth seeing.Recommended to anyone with a taste for a wicked, wild, entertaining love story. 8/10",Null,0,2,28 April 2001
