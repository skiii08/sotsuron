The Blair Witch Project," Shocking like a piece of cake
","The mysterious Blair Witch Project...I had no idea of this film when i went to the movies to watch it, i hadn´t noticed the hype around this film and I only wanted to watch it because some friends of mine had told me that it was great so I was quite anxious...and I left the movie theater totally disappointed! This movie isn´t shocking at all! The night scenes are ridiculous and I can´t understand people that are afraid of anything after that movie. I only saw the German dubbed version of the BWP, and concerning me I could have killed the girl. She and her continuous screaming and crying almost drove me crazy, but it didn´t scare me. And it also didn´t create a tense and mysterious or even shocking atmosphere! For me, this is the worst film of the year!!!",1,1,3,8 January 2000
