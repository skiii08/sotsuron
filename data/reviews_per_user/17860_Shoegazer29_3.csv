Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A TAD DISAPPOINTING...
","Well I just got back from the multiplex, and let me tell you, KILL BILL VOL. 2 IS NOT WHAT MOST VIEWERS ARE GOING TO EXPECT. The only review of Vol. 2 I had read before watching the movie myself was Rolling Stone's Peter Travers's take on things. I have to say that Mr. Travers was more than a little misleading, but that is besides the point (He gave it a 4 out of a 4).The movie begins well enough, with Uma Therman speaking directly to the camera courtesy of cheesy '40s fare. Then The Bride provides backstory on her wedding, her training, and a little on her relationship with Bill. Keep in mind all of this is intercut with the encounters between The Bride and Budd, and The Bride and Elle Driver (We even find out how she lost that eye). The switching up of present and past maintains the fast pace of Vol. 1, while providing indepth insight into The Bride, something new in Vol. 2. ALTOGETHER THE FIRST HOUR IS SOME GREAT FILMMAKING.Unfortunately, it is this newfound appreciation for emotional insight that ends up being the film's worst flaw; THE SECOND HOUR OF THE FILM IS DOMINATED BY TALKING. Not that talking is bad or unnecessary for movies, but the energy of the Vol. 1 is all but lost during some of the particularly grating scenes. Granted there is the final showdown between Bill and Uma, but this is preceded by possibly the most degrading showing from Tarantino yet. And what I mean by that is this (And don't infer that I don't respect Quentin Tarantino, because I do), conversation after conversation, MORE AND MORE IS SPELLED OUT for us. Not in a symbolic or metaphorical sense, but in an actual question and answer session between the film's two key players. I found this to be insulting to my intelligence, and anyone else's for that matter. If you payed any attention to Vol. 1 the whole scene is EXTREMELY PREDICTABLE and LABORIOUS TO WATCH.-i have to pause for a second-After reading what I've written I see that I'M PAINTING AN OVERLY NEGATIVE PICTURE of Kill Bill Vol. 2. I suppose I'm still frustrated that I already bought Vol. 1 on DVD, expecting Vol. 2 to surpass the first and tie everything together. And IF VOL. 2 REALLY TRIES TO DO ONE THING, THAT WOULD BE COMPLETING THE PICTURE. But I must reiterate that that is exactly my problem with this movie, IT STOPS MOVING FORWARD TO PICK UP WHAT IT LEFT BEHIND, AND TAKES ITS TIME DOING SO (And even still one important question is never answered. Why does Hatori Hanzo not like Bill? What drives him to make the sword?).
I say: Kill Bill Vol. 1 - 9/10 Kill Bill Vol. 2 - 7/10 Kill Bill (Whole)- 8/10A two-part to remember, possibly more for its stylistic prowess than anything else, but nothing to live by. A combined release with intermission might have helped. I do realize that isn't very practicle (Look how the Lord of the Rings movies did though, despite length).",9,1,2,16 April 2004
Hotel Rwanda," very, very disappointing
","do not see 'Hotel Rwanda' ever. and by ever i mean never ever. not in theaters and certainly not when it comes out on DVD. do not rent it. do not watch it at a friend's house. if it is ever screened on television...change the channel. now you might be wandering what is so bad about this movie, and to be perfectly honest it wasn't the worst movie i've ever seen (cough-'Armageddon'-cough), but it was without a doubt one of the most disappointing releases in years. what works me up so much about this particular film's suckage is the buzz surrounding it; three Oscar nominations - THREE!! don cheadle was fine, but that was about it. i don't give kudos to performances that beg for them, and this would be such a case. the story that the film explores, the rwandan genocide of 1994, is in itself a captivating subject. however the way in which this conflict is presented in this film plumbs all the depths of my bathroom sink. but the cardinal sin of this clunker is doubtlessly the writing. i might only feel this way because i personally have an interest in screen writing, and because it is my belief that you can only make a good film if you start with a good screenplay, but in any case, the dialogue and pacing in 'Hotel Rwanda' just plain blows. i can't count how many times i rolled my eyes during one of cheadle's characters monologues. i could go on forever but i...i just need to stop. i suppose i'll finish by telling you, the reader, that i really hate this movie because it did have promise. there were moments where i almost felt a twinge of compassion for the characters and events on screen, and that is why this is the most frustrating release in a long time. +_+_+_+_3/10_+_+_+_+",3,7,68,6 February 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Not as bad as people are saying.
","I don't see why this movie is taking the beating it so unjustly deserves. It's not a bad film by any means, neither is it Lawrence of Arabia, but that shouldn't have been suspected. What especially disturbs me is the comments people make implying that this movie, 'doesn't live up to the first film.' Maybe I'm alone when I say this but...well, the first movie wasn't that great. Don't get me wrong, it's originality was astounding, but the script, and acting, left a little more than a little to be desired. So for the sequel my expectations were greatly lowered.Maybe that is why I enjoyed the sequel much more than the original.  No, one reason I liked the second movie better (and the most shallow reason) is the noticeably better budget, and therefore better special effects. There was one problem with the pyrotechnics, there was a little too much of them. After about the tenth fight scene you just don't care, but I'm more of a plot person anyway.Secondly I enjoyed this movie more because the script was SO MUCH BETTER! In the first film half wit one-liners almost ruined any fun to be had, but thankfully, almost all of that has changed, almost.Finally, some bad news. With the exceptions of Keanu Reeves (Who has gotten better by not acting if you know what I mean) and the Oracle lady, everyone has taken a step backward in portraying their character. Either that, or they were given nothing to play (As in Carrie Ann-Moss's Trinity). But all in all...well, I was not impressed. Sorry to end on a sour note but it had to be said.8/10",7,0,0,28 May 2003
