Ghost," Simply Marvelous
","What a wonderful film.  I do not have many romantic movies in my collection, but this is definitely one that I have. Whoopi Goldberg is in a good movie for once and actually delivers. My friend Joe hasn't seen the whole movie, but the parts he saw he did not like. I guarantee he will be a raving fan by the time I make him watch it.",8,3,4,8 December 2000
Ghostbusters," who ya gonna call?
","I think this is a classic. Every movie fan should have this one on their shelves. Who can honestly say they didn't like this movie? Bill Murray is hilarious, and teamed up with Sigourney Weaver and the other Ghostbusters, this turned out to be a wonderfully animated film.",8,0,0,8 December 2000
Gladiator," Biggest Disappointment EVER
","I ordered this movie in a hotel room for 10 dollars in hopes that I would be watching a possible Best Picture nominee. Instead, I watched a confusing, poorly executed excuse for a movie. The first war scene's camera angles and overall layout had me wondering who was who. I hope other people did not have to pay 10 dollars to watch such a disappointment.",4,1,2,8 December 2000
Beetlejuice," Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice
","Michael Keaton and Alec Baldwin deliver oscar-winning performances. It's a shame they didn't win any. I think this was possibly the movie that launched Wyona Rider's career, and was also a strong point for Geena Davis. This was also the platform for the now famous director Tim Burton. Overall, a great starting movie for many actors/actresses/directors.",7,1,2,13 December 2000
