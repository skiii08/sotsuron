Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Transcending the Genre
","In many ways, Kill Bill:Vol.2 is to the Kung Fu genre what Shrek 2 is to fairy tales. Although these are very different films, both spoof all previous movies of their type and are loaded with insider allusions (just look at the length of the IMDb trivia sections for each!). Both use latest technology to create a hyper-real quality which goes beyond their forerunners to create a feel that the viewer is seeing something that has not been seen before. But each also stays true to their genres' conventions of character and plot that, though seemingly worn out, we still love. As a result these movies satisfy, meeting some deep rooted needs but in novel and refreshing ways.2004 may signal a trend in this kind of treatment of well treaded genres, with Westerns and Film Noir as other potential future candidates.",8,0,1,4 December 2004
American History X," The Physics of Hatred
","This film, more than any other, is a treatise on hatred; its' laws, dynamics and consequences. What's insidious is that hatred often begins with some rational arguments, which are masterfully presented in the movie. But those arguments are not so much intended to persuade, as to tap into deep human instincts of self preservation. Those fears trigger anger, and rational thought becomes distorted.A powerful metaphor for the entire film occurs in the brief scene where Daniel begins his 'American History X' essay. He types in the line 'Analyze and interpret'. As the line repeats down the page it mutates and becomes increasingly incoherent, then abruptly rematerializes in a reconstituted form that looks similar to the starting point, but is in fact vulgar. This progression foreshadows the rest of the movie, on several levels.The movie demonstrates that any group based on hatred, whether neo-Nazis, gangs or terrorists, leads only to the ultimate ruin of its' members.",7,0,1,10 November 2004
Schindler's List," Transformed by the white light
","What makes this film truly remarkable is the personal transformation which Oskar Schindler under goes just past the mid-point of the movie in a series of incredibly subtle scenes. Early on, Schindler is driven only by selfish desire for money, women and influence. Others may benefit from his actions, but it is purely a by-product. Never does he help someone to his own detriment. He narrowly rescues Itzhak Stern from a train to a death camp and then scolds him, saying 'If I had been five minutes later, then where would I be?'. But by the end of the movie, Schindler willingly loses all his personal wealth and repeatedly risks his life in order to save others. The inflection point takes place at a meeting between Schindler and Stern at the Plaszow work camp. It's night and Oskar leaves a Nazi party to see his accountant. At the end of a brief conversation Stern says ' Don't let things fall apart. I worked too hard for this'. He is pleading with Schindler to take personal responsibility. As Stern walks away a search beacon shines over his shoulder and fills the screen with a blinding white light. The camera cuts to Oskar. He is engulfed by the light. He smiles of deep satisfaction. This sets off an amazing sequence of scenes: - Schindler comes to the aid of a metal presser. - He gives protection in his factory to a traumatised boy, despite the fact that he has no skills. He gives up his own silver lighter and cigarette case to make these two events happen. - He comforts Amon Goeth's abused maid. They sit beneath a cone of white light. At a point where he could easily take advantage of her, instead he helps her renew her will to survive. - In a discussion with Goeth after a party, he explains that true power comes not from control or the ability to kill, but the ability to forgive. This could be further interpreted as 'Success in life comes not from pursuing personal gain, but from rising above it'. Goeth is amused and intrigued by this but in the subsequent tragic 'bath tub stain' scene, we see that he is pathetically incapable of internalizing anything that was said. - In perhaps the most powerful scene of the film, a women comes to Schindler and begs that he take her skilless, aged parents into his factory to save their lives. He appears from on high at the top of a long stair case. She tells him ' No one ever dies here. It is a haven. They say that you are good'. One can easily substitute the word 'heaven' for 'haven' and 'God' for 'good'. In rage, Schindler throws her out. But then he goes to see Stern. He tells Stern that there is good in all people but that war brings out the worst in them. He uses this to rationalize and forgive the behavior of Goeth. We fully expect that he will now use this to rationalize his own selfish behavior. Instead he takes the watch from his own wrist and gives it to Stern to use to buy the lives of the two elderly parents. The irony is that war has borough out good in Schindler that might never have emerged otherwise. From here on out Schindler performs a continuous series of selfless acts. Moreover,despite the huge personal risks he takes, we feel good about the choices he makes and therefor we are transformed a little bit, along with him.",10,30,51,15 March 2004
Hero," Haunting beauty and provocative message
","Hero is noteworthy on at least two counts.First, there are scenes of haunting beauty('Duel in the yellow forest' and 'Turquoise autumn' to site a couple) that, like the best of impressionist paintings, are so affecting that you will forever see the world in a slightly different way having once beheld them.Secondly, the overall message of the film is a provocative one. The claim is that a degree of human casualties and suffering may be the optimal path to a better world, especially when the alternative is equally brutal chaos. This is not a popular theme. It has become much more fashionable to be anti-war in all cases. And understandably so, since variations of this logic have often been used in the past to justify atrocities. But the film provides a crisp litmus test for avoiding delusion: action must be taken with a heart void of malice and an unwavering commitment to the broadest possible ultimate outcome of good for all. Can anyone live up to this standard? Several characters in the movie do, each in their own way. If the standard could be met, would the world be a better place? These are questions worth reflecting on that have not been dealt with, to this depth, in any film I'm aware of.",10,249,301,2 January 2005

Grindhouse," Tarantino is the Stravinsky of Movies
","Tarantino's critics do not seem to fully understand what he is up to. More than 'making movies' he 'makes movies about movies', in this case the B-movie genre.This is what Igor Stravinsky did with music. He would take some genre(baroque, 12 tonal or even jazz music), break it down into the essence of its component parts and then put them back together in different ways. What you got was no longer baroque, 12 tonal or jazz. It made you stop to wonder what those styles really were and why they appealed or didn't appeal to you.In a way, Tarantino is doing the same thing. He's making us question why we go to these movies and what the process of watching a film is all about. As a result it is not fair to criticize him because 'the girls should have just stopped the car'. In B-movies the girls just don't stop the car! It's like criticizing a serious drama for not having enough good jokes. He has really captured something about why these movies get audiences and are such intense fun to watch.Now that Tarantino has dabbled with films about B-movies, kung-fu movies,action movies,revenge movies, etc. it will be interesting to see if he can extend into other genres. Will we ever see a Tarantino musical, serious drama, love story or western?",8,24,46,11 October 2007
