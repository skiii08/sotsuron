Antz," Excellent for ALL ages
","Something is wrong with the USA! I just returned from ANTZ with my 9 year old. A brilliant movie (I admit to being an Allen fan and this is Annie Hall with a sting). Why would you not let any kid see it, I have seen much worse on TV at 7pm (Friends etc) much more sex and violence (Sienfeld the contest!). No it is not Disney (thank you) and it is excellent animation and it does have a happy end. And the words CRAP and DAMN have become part of the vocabulary. Teaching children means teaching them when these are appropriate not hoping to shield them from the words. If you won't take your kids, throw out your TV sets... The movie is well crafted with a great plot and yes, more targeted to adults but plenty there for kids,,,I suffered through an abominable stream of kids movies, including George of the Jungle and Pet detective 2 this was a joy!!!",Null,0,0,24 October 1998
