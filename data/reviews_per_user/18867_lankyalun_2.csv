First Man," Hollow space movie
","Im a huge fan of Damien Chazelle's first two features so I was very excited to see First Man. Unfortunately I came out a bit disappointed. The story of Neil Armstrong landing on the moon I imagined would be a long hard journey with a roller coasters of emotions. The film makes it all seem very pedestrian, with very little drama. Very hollow film devoid of interesting characters.",5,4,8,22 October 2018
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Have never come so close to walking out of a film half way through!
","I have never considered walking out of a film before but for most of the film I was contemplating doing just that! The film had so much potential, hence why after reading the films premise I was excited to see the film. The trailer made the film look good but all of the funniest parts were in the trailer, so my advice is to watch the trailer and not bother with this boring comedy. George Clooney is great at playing cool characters but his role in this film requires him to be a buffoon which he is neither funny or enjoyable to watch- It actually makes him look like a crap actor. Ewan McGregor is his normal overacting self, living in the shadow of his only good performance as Renton in 'Trainspotting.' I really wonder why he is still cast in big roles! A great cast with a poor script that should have been so much better. However I can see how this film might have looked good on paper but a lack of development, it seems, left the film with too many flaws.My advice- Watch the trailer and burn any copies you see lying around at friends houses (only joking) but don't watch this film, it is a big old mess!",3,6,11,15 October 2010
