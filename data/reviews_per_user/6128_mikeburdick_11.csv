Hereditary," So close to being a classic
","There is so much to love about 'Hereditary.' The acting, particularly Toni Collette and Alex Wolff, is raw and real. The glacial pacing adds to the skin-crawling creepiness. The soundtrack drags you into the depths of dread. And the subtle visual effects are probably the highlight, teasing and toying with the viewer's sense of reality, offering real frights, not just momentary shocks.That said, without giving anything away, where 'Hereditary' misses the mark for me is by explaining too much. The best psychological horror films, in my opinion, succeed by carefully treading that line between what's real and what's a figment of the imagination-and to be fair, 'Hereditary' does succeed in treading this line for a good part of the film-however, when it comes to wrapping it up, the ambiguity is either left open, as in 'The Haunting,' 'Cache,' or 'The Babadook,' or answered with a plausible truth, as in 'Les Diaboliques,' 'The Innocents,' 'Psycho,' or 'The Wicker Man.' Personally, I felt the ending was neither here nor there. There's a Netflix show called 'Requiem' that plays with similar themes, with a more satisfying conclusion.Still, I think this film is entertaining and will satisfy most horror film fans. I'd be extremely suspect of the 1-star reviews, as this is a solidly crafted film with excellent production values, superb acting and insightful writing. As I said, so close...",7,2,5,21 October 2018
The Babadook," Much more than a horror film
","While 'The Babadook' may display some of the hallmarks of the traditional horror film, there's a lot more going on here than meets the eye. Far from the typical Hollywood bloodfest so brilliantly satired in 'Cabin in the Woods,' this film's characters are layered, its plot is mercurial, its actions are metaphorical, and its conclusions are ambiguous. All this is likely to disappoint those filmgoers who need to be spoonfed a formula. But if you're a film lover, Do. Not. Miss. This.Director Jennifer Kent understands what most horror filmmakers fail to grasp: that our biggest fear isn't of crazy killers or monsters or ghosts, but of ourselves—what lives inside us, the emotions we have to live with, the illusory veil of self-control. The plot revolves around a mum, her troubled son and the book he pulls off the shelf one night. But you already know too much. This is one film where knowing less going into it will really pay dividends. Really, don't even watch the trailer.Just know that the storytelling and craft are flawless. Essie Davis delivers one of the most challenging performances put to screen with total commitment and credibility. Kent's storytelling is utterly absorbing and she so delicately treads the line between what's real and what's not that you can never be sure of yourself. What you make of 'The Babadook' will depend on who you are. You might take it at face value, as a creepy monster flick with all the constant threat and looming dread and shocking moments. You might take it as an attempt to capture the authentic experience of mental illness. You might take it as a symbolic story using a metaphor for grief and loss. The best films make you feel something and allow you the room to make sense of it yourself.Personally, I thought about this film for days after seeing it, both because of its ambiguity and because of the themes it explores, namely mental illness and domestic violence. Yes, it's scary. But it's also touching and heartbreaking. While 'The Babadook' belongs alongside other great psychological horror films, like 'The Innocents' and 'The Haunting' (1963), to classify it purely as 'horror' really belittles its accomplishment as a film that challenges us to examine and discuss issues we are very uncomfortable tackling in reality.",9,124,173,29 August 2015
Knives Out," A mystery without a clue
","As a lover of the old 'whodunnit' genre, I really had high hopes for 'Knives Out.' It does, after all, have many of the essential ingredients: an all-star cast, a big house, a slew of self-interested characters, an unexplained murder. However, the biggest mystery in 'Knives Out' is how it murdered itself.There are several suspects. Was it the casting director, placing such a well-known English actor into the role of a Southerner with a drawl? I mean, Daniel Craig isn't just British, he's James Bond.Was it the cinematographer, designing grandiose camera moves into every scene, including simple dialogue scenes?Was it the actors who-outside of Toni Collette-didn't seem to understand this was meant to be a comedy?Was it the producers, who couldn't decide what this movie should be, a comedy, a thriller, a satire, an homage?In the end, I suspect it was the writer-director who did it, on the page, with a fountain pen. Only he decided that each character needed to explain their story to the viewer, rather than leaving us guessing. Only he failed to add the humorous touches that could have made it entertaining-and extract some truly lame jokes. Only he was responsible for hiring actors who couldn't deliver the right quirk or humour.It's a shame, because I really loved certain elements-the homage to 'Sleuth,' the not-so-subtle political message, some of the twists. But I couldn't help feeling I wished it was a bit more like 'Hot Fuzz,' with its humour, memorable characters and witty dialogue. And a bit more like 'And Then There Were None' in terms of its suspense and mystery.Normally, I'd recommend a mildly entertaining film, especially one with a good message, but this one is way too much of a mess.",5,9,16,25 December 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," More than a great Marvel
","I'd pretty much given up on the Spider-Man franchise, after the first two reboots, which I felt were predictable and hokey, with lame effects. Thankfully, 'Homecoming' really delivers where the others missed the mark. This is a fun film, and feels like it fits right in with the new Avengers universe.Somewhere along the way ('Ant Man' or 'Deadpool'?) it dawned Marvel that humour was key to buttressing the somewhat shallow superhero-villain formula. And this script is full of witty dialogue and deftly timed comedic moments.It also helps that Tom Holland has the perfect blend of cocky naïveté and charm to make him real and relatable. Neither Toby Maguire nor Andrew Garfield felt believable in the role, although to be fair, they didn't have a script this good and effects have come a long way. It's also good to see quality actors like Michael Keaton, Marisa Tomei and Donald Glover bringing an authenticity and complexity to roles that are normally one-dimensional.The aspect of the film that impressed me the most was the storytelling. Often in Marvel films, the action and effects overwhelm the story, leaving you lost at certain points. In 'Homecoming,' you follow everything that's happening every step of the way. Kudos to the director and editor for a well-told story with well-drawn characters and well-timed gags.The best indication of the film's success may be the fact that it is a long film, but it never felt that way. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, perhaps even moreso than 'Spiderverse,' which was wildly creative and certainly one of the most interesting Marvels. Certainly feels like they've breathed new life into the Spider-Man.",9,2,2,30 December 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," An immaculate cake with a hollow centre
","Wes Anderson's films are immaculately planned and executed, particularly when it comes to art direction, set design and costumes. If you can relinquish yourself to the intricate worlds he creates and ask only to be entertained, you're unlikely to walk away unsatisfied. Which probably explains why I always feel slightly cheated walking out of his incredibly imaginative, flawlessly executed gems—they seem slightly hollow. To me, 'Bottle Rocket,' despite its flaws, captured a reality and a complexity that I don't believe Wes has delivered since. Don't get me wrong, I love the unique style and quirky cast of characters that he's generated since 'Rushmore.' I honestly just wish that I could care more, that I connected more with the characters. As a point of comparison, I highly recommend Aki Kaurismaki, who also creates stylised worlds with interesting characters, but with more humanity. He never fails to make you laugh or cry, but most of all, leaves you thinking about the film after it's over.",7,2,4,25 April 2014
The Favourite," Bound to be a classic
","'The Favourite' is a near-perfect film that solidifies Yorgos Lanthimos amongst the rarified club of master filmmakers. Its script crackles with caustic dialogue that rivals 'The Sweet Smell of Success,' its dark humour rivals 'Dr. Strangelove,' and its costumes rival 'Barry Lyndon.' The top-shelf actors are at the top of their game. And what a beautiful film, with stunning photography that elegantly captures the massive scale of the palace, often utilising a fish-eye lens to lend an off-kilter feeling, reminiscent of the Czech New Wave. As a lover of film, there are a lot of suspect reviews here. I'm never surprised that there are a few people who are turned off by something or other-period pieces, sardonic humour-but to give a low rating to a film as well-acted and well-crafted as this film-clearly one of the year's best-is completely disingenuous. Catch it on the big screen, it's deserving.",9,6,15,30 December 2018
Drive," A Porsche of a cast, driven into a brick wall
","These days, it's pretty easy to put lipstick on a pig in Hollywood. Get a great DoP, which Newton Thomas Sigel is, and it'll look fantastic. Assemble a bunch of great actors, which this film has, and they'll make you feel some emotion. But at the end of the day, this is a squealing pig of a film, and the fault lies almost entirely with the script.I'm not going to mince words: this is a terrible script. One can't help feel that it was written by a 15-year-old kid who'd seen a few movies and thought, 'Hey, I can do that!' And this was his first go.Without giving anything away, Gosling's character is a tough-guy stunt driver who moonlights as a tough-guy heist driver who—by some 'unexpected' twist of fate— gets himself mixed up with the wrong guys and has to drive his way out of it. He's a man of few words, largely because the writer of the script couldn't come up with an interesting piece of dialogue if his life depended on it. And we're meant, I suppose, to care about his fate.Now, a bad script coming out of Hollywood wouldn't mean much were there not such a stellar cast involved. There's not a bad actor in the bunch, and a couple of them are amongst the best around (Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan). What a terrible waste, the banal lines coming out of these talented mouths. Of course, it's Hollywood and so long as there's a lot of violence and a love interest, it checks the boxes, right? Not exactly. First of all, you have to care about the characters —not because they're cute and appear to be attracted to each other or because there's a gun pointed at them, but because they are real and honest human beings. There is simply zero honesty here. On top of all this, the soundtrack is inane. The style was seemingly chosen because the director either really liked '80s movies like 'Beverly Hills Cop' or believed a music director who told him 'the '80s are coming back' and using '80s-style music would be hip. It was certainly a conscious choice, since the type matches the '80s theme. But why? Was the movie set in the '80s? No. Was there a character who was obsessed with the '80s? No. And that sort of sums up 'Drive.' Why? Why does it exist? Even were you to say, 'Don't look so deep, it's a pure piece of catharsis,' before you can experience catharsis, you still need to develop characters you give a damn about. And frankly, I feel a bit cheated.",4,1,3,10 July 2016
Pulp Fiction," Clever but derivative and hollow
","Admittedly, 'Pulp Fiction' was incredibly seductive when I first saw it in the theatre (as was 'Reservoir Dogs'). It was so un-Hollywood in many ways. It mashed together French New Wave with schlocky exploitation with Hong Kong action with gangster films, etc. Maybe that's enough to make it a notable film. Certainly, to any casual American film-goer, Tarantino is very interesting and entertaining. However, after a couple of decades of exploring world cinema, 'Pulp Fiction' drops a couple of pegs. All the clever dialogue, quirky music choices and obscure film references can't conceal the fact that there's very little story and you really don't care much about the characters.This is not to say the actors aren't terrific, because they are (other than Tarantino himself, who is dreadful). Samuel L. Jackson is particularly intense. But it's a bit too much style over substance. Great to have authentic, human dialogue, but better if you get to know the characters and care to follow their journey. Sure, there's suspense, in that you wonder who might get done next, but hard to care whether they do or what that might mean to the other characters.I also feel 'Pulp Fiction' borrows far too much from other films. Some will perhaps say, 'it's Tarantino's thing,' 'it's not lifting, it's homage' or 'it adds a layer of depth for film fans.' But come on, that's really a copout. You can be influenced and even wear your influences on your sleeve, but there are scenes and ideas that are straight lifted from Godard, Woo, Aldrich, Boorman, Besson and Kubrick, to name a few. In the end, after you're through stripping away the 'homage,' the casual violence, and the suspenseful threats of violence, you've got some colourful dialogue skits delivered by some fine actors. But it leaves you wondering, what was the point of it all?",6,1,2,28 August 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Finally, a deserving Best Picture
","Once in a blue moon, a Hollywood film comes along that you wouldn't expect from Hollywood. Rarer still does a film that feels un-Hollywood also win Best Picture. So good on the Academy for choosing 'Birdman.'While the script is unexpected and decidedly off-beat, there are some mildly implausible relationships, requisite violence and 'push the envelope' sex scenes that lead me to believe 'Birdman' could have become yet another quirky indie film, like 'American Splendor' or 'Living in Oblivion.' But it's Iñárritu's incomparable direction that pushes it into the realm of classic. Firstly, the choice of Michael Keaton to play a Hollywood actor much like himself in real life was genius (although Robert Downey Jr. might have worked as well). The fact that he took the role, which pokes fun of himself, elevates Keaton to legend status alone, forget that he owns the role and is entirely convincing. Secondly, the choice to capture entire scenes in a single shot and even segue from scene to scene (seemingly) without cutting makes it feel as if we're seeing an entire three days uncut. This simulates the nervousness and sleeplessness of Riggin, increasing the viewer's unease throughout.Thirdly, the jazz music score perfectly reflects both the shambolic life of Riggin and the camera-work, which makes the viewer feel as if we're continuously falling, uncontrollably from one scene to the next. But most of all, the magical realism—whether in the script or added by Iñárritu—that creates a poetry not often seen in American films, more reminiscent of films like Emir Kusturica's 'Time of the Gypsies' or Gregory Nava's 'El Norte.' While Hollywood is quite consistent in spelling everything out for viewers, world cinema is not afraid of creating impressions and leaving loose ends untied. It's encouraging that a film like 'Birdman' has been awarded with the highest honour. Perhaps we'll start to see more films from Hollywood that, rather than entertaining us for 90 minutes with superficial two-dimensional story lines, are allowed to explore the universes within ourselves and let us answer questions for ourselves.",8,1,4,5 October 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," A satire about our dark ritual
","Most seem to peg 'The Cabin in the Woods' as either a traditional horror film with a neat twist or a predictable horror film that becomes increasingly ridiculous. However, a literal viewing the story totally misses the point.It's quite clear that this film is a satire, not so much a parody of the genre as a vehicle for the filmmakers to poke fun at you, the audience, 'the Ancients,' whose unquenchable thirst for blood must be appeased. The NASA-like technical team that 'produces' the 'sacrifice'—with precision and professionalism, totally detached from any moral culpability, ensuring every single moment 'sticks to the script'—these might just represent filmmakers, or more generally, the Hollywood system.I think this is what makes this film quite ingenious. It's sort of like a mainstream version of Haneke's 'Funny Games.' The filmmaker is trying to jolt you out of your somnambulistic film-watching routine and make you think about what you're doing and perhaps ask yourself some interesting and uncomfortable questions. Why do we watch these films? Are we as sick as the people manning the controls? Is this really entertainment? Why must a film always live within the boundaries of the formula? And if it break the rules, will it really be the 'end of the world'?",7,0,2,1 May 2014
The Bourne Supremacy," A sequel worth watching
","I'm not a big fan of Hollywood films, particularly sequels, which is probably why I've held off on this series for so long, but continue to be pleasantly surprised by both the intelligence and execution of the 'Bourne' films. This is less of a sequel and more part two of a complete story. Matt Damon plays a vulnerable Bourne with humanity and empathy, which all lends to the believability of the character. The story is well thought through, leaving none of the gaping holes that are the hallmark of most action films. The dialogue is considered and realistic. It's also refreshing to see women treated as fully drawn characters, rather than pretty props. Worth watching just for the car chase, easily one of the best in film history.",7,0,1,5 April 2014
