Vertigo," The pull of Hitchcock against the tide of time
","Alfred Hitchcock was such a consummate director that approving his work is like investing in a blue chip stock: our taste is unlikely to be berated or otherwise devalued. In Vertigo, we find the usual Hitchcock hallmarks: slow, deliberate development, Hitchcock at the wheel - we must submit to his pace as the Master spins his tale -, backdropped by clean and balanced sets that are pleasing to the eye. Most of you must have encountered the kind of storyteller who can take sparse material and keep us spellbound with it over a period of time that far exceeds what we might have thought possible. This is the essence of Hitchcock's mastery of suspense, and he has deservedly become a benchmark in it.The contrast between the long buildups of tension in Hitchcock's movies and the instant gratification in many of today's offerings is striking. Most conspicuous today is an over-reliance on loud blasts from the score and over-reactions from the actors to compensate shortcomings in building suspense. At the same time, however, the audience has mutated in reaction to this, and Hitchcock will seem, at times, too slow and timid for our present-day sensibilities. This seems preposterous to those who have embraced him.There is, however, a pitfall in becoming a benchmark: it validates itself 100%, even if the teeming masses drift away from it somewhat. Having myself experienced that drift, I have a few problems with Vertigo.SPOILERSThe implausibility - of the premise, of the characters and their reactions, of the master plan that had too many ways to go wrong and too many loose ends as to why it worked as far as it did - is the biggest problem that I suspect is forgiven as being acceptable for its time. The schoolboy crush is simply not credible. A cop being duped by the double who isn't a double is a real stretch. The woman being led up the bell tower by an obviously unstable man is hard to take and what provokes her falling from it (in the end) is just not credible. Those are quite a few allowances that we are asked to make on behalf of a master, sort of like giving charity to the rich.The acting is competent by today's standards, but no better. I didn't like Novak's performance, but others at IMDb did, and I'll concede it as a matter of personal taste.Consequently, Vertigo is, for me, an average movie, albeit a superbly crafted one.END OF SPOILERSDoes this mean that I resent this 'benchmark' status I attribute to Hitchcock? No, not in the least. As I said, I drifted from it somewhat, but am closer to it than I am to the excesses of today. And if Hitchcock's oeuvre as a benchmark somehow exerts a pull against these excesses, it is for the better.",Null,4,8,6 December 2004
The Others," My skin crawled with goose bumps, my hair stood on end.
","I strongly recommend it. The person behind me screamed several times. My skin was crawling with goose pimples ('ow you Américains say... gouss boomps?). Maybe not for all of you, as per a minority of the reviews on this site, but as I see it, the objections don't hold water. One thing I do like in a movie is rigor, and this one has it. Nicole Kidman, like the rest of the cast, is terrific. In fact, she was a revelation.",Null,0,1,12 August 2001
Cold Mountain," Catharsis and Natural Law
","There's an old Aesop's fable where a known imitator gets more applause imitating a pig than a farmer pretending to imitate one while actually making a real pig squeal. Plus ça change...When I'm more conscious of the actors in a movie than the characters they play, I'm disappointed. Unfortunately, Kidman and especially Zellweger had that very effect on me. Zellweger overacted, but may win an Oscar anyway. Both did a good job, but aren't there competent actors who don't have to affect NC accents? Well, then it wouldn't be such an acting performance, would it? I don't doubt for a minute that a strong director can draw excellent performances from little-known actors. However, we all know that a big budget movie needs big names.Slight spoilersThe movie was very good. We often think of the backdrops subtending the story, yet this time I often thought of the beauty of the landscapes and their constancy, giving form to the ephemeral void in which the characters, now all long dead, turned their tragic pirouettes. It's a movie that slowly pulls a long blade out of a wound only to use it again in a merciless blow as the price of catharsis. We are treated to little foretastes of this catharsis, one of which even explains the Natural Law that makes it necessary.",Null,0,0,1 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A near perfect adaptation of LOTR
","As one who has always wanted a top-quality movie adaptation of LOTR, I must say that Peter Jackson et al did a near perfect job.Spoilers, ya hear? SPOILERS!!!!!!The scenes were done with consumate artistry, the acting is terrific, the special effects are damned convincing and the score is excellent, though I'd have recommended atonal music for the bad guys. The battle with the Balrog vies with the first movie's outstanding beginning. The giant elephants, the trolls opening the gate (I thought trolls turned to stone in sunshine. Maybe they're given sunblock...) and of course the Ents are fantastic achievements. It's obvious that Gollum is drawn, but what a character! My brother, who isn't familiar with the books, found him to be among the most fascinating characters he's ever seen.Gandalf's wink was priceless, Aragorn and Legolas are perfectly cast, Gimli's buffoonery might offend purists but is well within the director's acceptable licence, Frodo (Wood) is proving to be a fine actor. Much of the dialogue, which could so easily fall flat, is pulled off extremely well. Elrond's (who up till then tended towards overacting) talk with his daughter, blended with the images of an aging Elessar (Aragorn), is memorable, on the level of a similar monologue by Al Pacino in 'Devil's Advocate'. Of the other hobbits, Pippin's Pythonesque absurdity (credit to Mr. Beare) is more irritating than endearing, but you can't like them all. And who doesn't like the great Christopher Lee - wotta villain!!! There's even Aragorn's romantic interest, pitting elf against human, that is vicariously titillating a number of nerds I know.The wheels could easily have fallen off this movie with all its disparate and outlandish elements. They didn't.My only problems are with Tolkien's affectations. A couple days' flight by a giant eagle dropping the ring in the fire would be less risky, would have saved time and thousands of lives - but then there wouldn't be a story, would there? Sparing Wormtongue allowed him to give counsel that resulted in hundreds (only??) of deaths (though also resulting in the routing of a vast army). The horses running through those spears was a stretch. Airlifting Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas into the middle of the 10,000 strong army (though a statistical pixel-analysis reveals the number to be approximately 47,350, but this can be attributed to over-zealous rogue computer agency) as it was leaving Isengard would have allowed those three, under divine (read: Tolkien) protection, to decimate the bad guys. At a kill rate of about 300 per hour, the entire army would have been wiped out in a day and a half. When any of these three are out in the open, enemy arrows mysteriously cease to exist. In the first instalment, a single Uruk-Hai was almost too much for Aragorn; now an *injured* Aragorn among Uruk-Hai is like a Tasmanian Devil with razor blades among paper dolls. Oh well, after all it's mythology. I still think the books and the movies are high points in their respective artforms. Looking forward to ROTK.",Null,0,0,27 December 2002
School of Rock," Better than Gandhi...
","...not! Nearly 40% of voters give this thing a 10/10, putting this movie among the 150 best movies of all time. I get suspicious when looking at this and some other movies' ratings forming a consistent curve which is broken by an incongruous multiplicity of 10s. This is a feel-good movie whose 'loser earns redemption' theme is the oldest whore in the house. It handles itself decently, though, and rates a respectable inflation-adjusted 6.2.Nowadays, there's some concern with lying in society, be it Enron, White House interns or WMD. Hollywood merits special consideration, because Hollywood is make-believe. The 10-year-old drummer is played by a 15-year-old actor and the 10-year-old guitarist with 3 years' experience is played by a 12-year-old actor with 9 years' experience, and the kids in the class are not a fortuitous assemblage of kids in some random class, but are selected by Hollywood to show what heartfelt rebellious pep-talking can do to actualize young children. Jack Black's pep talks are a little too frantic and wouldn't dupe most sub-10-year-olds I know. However, to appreciate the good side of this enjoyable story, one must accept these lies as artistic licence. I believe most movie-goers embed this 'caveat emptor' into their appreciation of movies and now sometimes even into their ratings.",Null,0,0,8 October 2003
Speed," 60 Watts
","No, this isn't an address, it's the wattage of the average cop in this movie.Spoilers Were the wattage 100, Officer Traven would have shown his badge BEFORE the bus reached 50 mph and there would have been no movie. Okay, mistake number 1 (though not for box office). Then there are the cops, with guns out, going into the bomber's house. Now, I kinda had the feeling then and there that the weapon of choice for a bomber is a bomb, but the cops went in and mistake number 2: Boom! A few Darwin awards there. Then Annie Porter, for no good reason, goes to the last scene, revealing herself, and now the bomber knows that they somehow made it off the bus. Mistake number 3, mayhem ensues. This is all too much, but I guess to take our mind off this, they make the bus fly, ET-style. 'Don't worry', the producers think, 'the idiots will love this.' 4/10",4,4,9,24 January 2005
