Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Even Better Than The First
","I first saw this one on its opening day, April 16, 2004, just as I had seen Volume One on its opening day, six months earlier. The night before I saw it I refreshed my memory by viewing the first film and I was glad that I did. Both movies really should be viewed as one single film because of how much you miss if you see just one of them. However, I will say that each movie can also stand on its own as a great film. I'll begin by saying that I enjoyed this one just a little bit more than the first. I think that has a lot to do with David Carradine. Quentin Tarantino has a knack for bringing fading stars back from obscurity and he did it again with this great actor. Carradine plays the title character and brings Bill to life so much so that you kind of find yourself a little worried about the fact that our protagonist might actually end up killing him as the title suggests.Speaking of our hero, Uma Thurman delivers yet another powerful performance as 'The Bride,' a former assassin hell bent on getting revenge for what her former 'co-workers' did to her on her wedding day. This chapter in the two volume series continues with The Bride's journey and leads up to a fantastic climax that only Tarantino, the best director of today's generation, could bring you.That's not all! There's even a cat fight that may go down in history as the best one ever captured on film. As one of the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad on The Bride's hit list, Daryl Hannah squares off against Uma Thurman in one of the tiniest spaces to hold a fight scene, a trailer home.Even Michael Madsen gets in on the action! As Bill's brother, Budd, Madsen plays one of the more sympathetic roles of his career, even though he's a cold blooded bastard. His character becomes very developed and we see what we saw only a glimmer of during the Vivica A. Fox sequence in the first: someone like us. We all know that Madsen is just another bad guy, but he shows us that those 'bad guys' are just regular people trying to live in a world that doesn't want them.Of course, we can't forget about Pai Mei. The most fearsome martial arts expert is played superbly in this film by Gordon Liu. Although he speaks only Mandarin in the film, his intimidating looks and fiery delivery give us another great supporting performance in a movie that I'll stay with any time I happen to catch it on television. I'm sure that you would do the same. Yes, this film is a bloody good conclusion to the Kill Bill saga and, if you've seen the first, you definitely need to see this one to find out what happens and how it goes down. I recommend this to anyone and everyone because it's one of the best films of this decade.",10,1,2,21 March 2007
Casablanca," 'Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By.''
","The film takes place in Casablanca during World War II. Humphrey Bogart is an American who runs the most popular cafe in town. But Bogart comes across two letters of transit. These letters are very valuable and the Nazis are after them. When a Nazi officer played by Conrad Veidt comes to the cafe, Claude Rains tries to please him. He uses an underground Czech leader played by Paul Henreid to do that. But Bogart's old lover has come back with Henreid. And she's played by Ingrid Bergman.Bogart is very surprised and it brings back many old memories. He wants to have her back, but he knows that she belongs with Henreid because those transit letters are for them. But will he let her get away again? That's the decision he must make at the end. And it's a very powerful ending. The story for this film is incredible. And it wasn't finished until the end of production. So know one knew the end of the movie. That makes it all more realistic. And gives Michael Curtiz, who directed the film, another reason to get that oscar.
Ingrid Bergman gives the best performance of her career and one of the greatest performances ever. Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains were nominated for oscars and shine in their roles to make this film one of the greatest ever made.It was nominated for Actor, Supporting Actor, Cinematography, Editing, and Score. It won Picture, Director, and Screenplay.",10,1,2,11 July 2004
Citizen Kane," Rosebud, Even!
","Citizen Kane is the story of Charles Foster Kane, a man very similar to that of William Randolph Hearst. Kane has it all, a multi-million dollar business, a mansion named Xanadu, and a celebrity that rivals the President of the United States. Even with all of this success, he dies alone and old uttering the mysterious word: 'Rosebud.' What does the word 'Rosebud' mean, you ask? Well, that's where the movies begins. In flashbacks, we hear all about the life and times of this very rich man called Kane. It's up to the reporters and you to figure out what it all means.A very interesting plot, but that's not the best part. You see, a movie like Citizen Kane has to have a lot more to be called the greatest movie of all time. Believe me, it has everything. I was lucky enough to see this film in the theater at a classic movie screening. The great thing is that it was my first viewing of this masterpiece. I'd heard a lot about it and over the years it got its massive reputation, but I didn't think it could be this good.One cannot describe in words how a movie could be so great. A film directed by a 25-year-old doesn't sound like a classic, but Orson Welles was able to change all that. His script is one of the greatest of all time. He had so much creativity that it all oozed out of him and onto the film. His portrayal of Kane is so realistic that you forget you're only watching a 25-year-old. The make-up artists can also take credit for this. All of the technical achievements are a marvel. This is the first movie to actually use a ceiling, so you know it has to be good. Another unforgettable use of scenery involves a dining room table. Kane and his wife have been growing farther and farther apart. To show this, Welles has a montage of dinners with the table getting longer and making Kane and his wife physically get farther and farther apart. That's just one example of the genius that this film is.It's too bad that 1941 audiences weren't able to really see this movie. The character of Kane was so close to Hearst that the famous newspaperman caused the film to fail at the box office. Hearst didn't want this movie to be seen. Luckily for us, we now have this film forever and can view it when ever we want. I highly recommend this milestone in film-making history.",10,1,4,18 July 2006
X-Men," My Favorite 'Superhero Movie'
","Everyone these days talks about how great Spider-Man, Batman Begins, or Superman Returns is, but they forget about the one film that made superhero movies popular again. Back when X-Men came out, I was blown away. I'd never seen a comic book movie have so much substance. The action was fantastic and this brand new talent named Hugh Jackman was destined to be a star.The story revolves around a school for gifted youngsters. The general population refers to them as mutants, but they're really just like everyone else. Some of these 'mutants' use the special power they've been given for good. They learn to harness their abilities and let them come out only when it is necessary. These extraordinary people are led by Charles Xavier, played by Patrick Stewart.Of course, there's another side to all of this. There are those who are using their unique traits for evil. Because of all of the hatred toward the mutants, the villains want to make everyone in the world a mutant. Their leader is Erik Lensherr, played by Ian McKellan, who is the perfect foil to Stewart's good natured character.Our main characters are that of a wide eyed girl, Anna Paquin, and a battle hardened soldier, Hugh Jackman. Both come to the school for gifted youngsters looking for answers or possibly a new life. Like the audience, they're new to this world of mutants and aren't sure of what to make of their 'super' powers.Through the course of the film, we run into many other mutants, both good and evil. Each one has a purpose and there's a reason for their inclusion in the movie. It's easy to have a favorite character and I'm sure you'll have one by the end of the movie. The fun and adventure is pretty infectious.One thing I've noticed about X-Men is that it seems to have been overshadowed and tossed aside because of all the other great movies of this genre that have come out since. Many people think that the sequel to this was even better, but true fans know otherwise. Each character, while we may not see much of them, has their own little scene. You'll remember them for something they do, even if they have just a few minutes of screen time.X-Men is the perfect superhero movie. It has everything you want in that category and more. The fact that it ends up being an allegory for something in today's society only adds to the greatness of this story. You don't have to love these kinds of movies to love X-Men and that's one of the reasons why I loved it so much. I just wish they could make them like this all of the time.",8,0,0,14 June 2007
The Best Years of Our Lives," The Best Film of 1946
","The story is about three men who return home from World War II. But the life they once knew has changed. One of the men has lost his hands in the war. He's become distant from his family and has to struggle to get over his problem.Another man returns to his loving family to find out that they've grown up and he's missed out on most of their childhoods. The last man has a lousy job and a loveless marriage. He finds himself in love with the family man's daughter.These three men must come to terms with the life their living in now. Or the war will become 'The Best Years of Our Lives.' Harold Russell plays the man who's lost his arms. He performs this role perfectly. He makes all of us feel sorry for him and frustrated at the same time. Fredric March plays the family man who brings the movie up so we have some happiness in this time. He does this very well, and has great chemistry with Myrna Loy, who plays his wife. And Dana Andrews plays the man who's falling in love with Teresa Wright. Both of them do a great job with showing their love on screen.The film won seven oscars including Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Screenplay, Editing, and Score. It only lost the award for Best Sound. Proving that this film is one of the greatest of all time.",10,2,3,19 July 2004
Barry Lyndon," Second Best of '75
","Second only to Jaws, Barry Lyndon is the story of an Irish rogue who's determined to get to the top of the social ladder any way he can. He'll lie, cheat, steal, and kill, but he always has time for women. A movie like this seems like it would be for anyone, but the 18th century setting and the three hour running time seem to put everyone off.Well, I'm here to tell you that it's not the movie you think it would be. The poster, which is one of my all time favorites, sums the film up brilliantly. Fighting and loving is what a man does best and that's what life seems to always end up being.Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's greatest film. The Art-Direction and Costumes are spectacular and they both deservedly won Oscars. The director captures that era brilliantly and does it with what seems like such ease. The battlefields are perfect and the everything is done for a reason. Kubrick even waited until the clouds in the sky were just how he wanted them before he started shooting a scene.And it never gets slow at all. Despite the long running time, it will always interest you to find out what Barry will try to do next. Which means that Kubrick has directed it in such a way that it's not like most other long films.The acting by Ryan O'Neal is the best of that year. It's a shame that he wasn't recognized by the Academy for a nomination. He truly deserved one, and not without the help of Kubrick.Stanley Kubrick deserved his long overdue Best Director award that year for the time and effort he put in to creating this masterpiece. It also won Oscars for Cinematography and Adaptation Score. It's one of the best films of the '70s and one of the best films of all time. It's also definitely the best thing Kubrick has ever done.",10,3,6,20 June 2004
Full Metal Jacket," Paint It Black
","Stanley Kubrick takes us on a voyage into darkness with this humanity tale of the horrors of the Vietnam war and how it affects the human beings who went through it. This is a story of people, real people and what they must do to survive in the harsh world of military boot camp and, ultimately, in the depths of hell.We see this world of terror through the wide eyes of Matthew Modine. During his stay at Parris Island, he meets his extremely tough sergeant, R. Lee Ermey, and he learns that all of the other recruits are just like he is. Many people believe that boot camp is the highlight of the film and I can see why. I can't think of another movie that makes the viewer feel worried for their own sake when someone is yelling at another character.The first half really sets us up for what's to come. We get to understand our protagonist and end up feeling just like he does. Modine is an everyman type that you can't help but feel for. You know what's going though his head in the bathroom scene because you're thinking the same thing.After boot camp, we're thrust right into the Vietnam scene. Not with combat, but with the way it really was. Prostitutes walking down streets and giving venereal diseases to the soldiers who bring them back home are some of the things you think about when you see the city landscape of where we are.If you've seen and love war movies like I do, you know that after the first combat scene, the feeling of having bullets flying by you just isn't the same. It's different with Full Metal Jacket. The tension in those scenes is drawn out so much that you're hooked into the moment so that even your heart is racing. I believe that these scenes are the best part of the film because there are very few war films that can do that. What makes Full Metal Jacket different from others of its genre is that we know all of the characters. We've met people or are very close friends with characters like Animal, Cowboy, Hartmann, and even Pyle. Very few films do that anymore and to have a war movie do it is something you can't take for granted.The finale sums up everything about the 1950s and '60s. It was the end of an era. When you see the scene, you realize the innocence that was taken away from this country so violently. An entire generation was lost because of this conflict and the world was changed forever.",10,1,2,5 May 2007
Forrest Gump," The Best Picture Winner of the Great Year That Was 1994
","Forrest Gump is about a man with the name of the title who is played by Tom Hanks. Forrest's only problem is the fact that his I.Q. isn't up to par with most of America. But that doesn't stop him from taking part in some of the greatest moments of the USA. He just might not know that he's doing it.We begin the story with a great musical score. It really sets the mood for what we're about to experience. We then see Forrest sitting on a bench. He begins to talk to the people that sit down next to him. The audience hears the story and begins to realize that, even with a low level of intelligence, this is an extraordinary man who has a lot of important things to say.He even goes into detail about the love of his life, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn). Forrest explains to the other bench sitters that he never got the chance to really understand his relationship with her until later in his life.With a character like Forrest Gump, who needs the other ones in the film. But the actors who do play those other roles are so good, that we even get to sympathize for them as well. That's what makes this film so good and that's the reason why it has become so popular. We care for the characters and we can really relate to them. This film is a great example of what life was like for the baby boomer era, but without the low I.Q.The film ended up winning six Academy Awards, including Picture, Director, Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, and Visual Effects. It was nominated for seven other Oscars, including Supporting Actor (Gary Sinise in an incredible role), Art-Direction, Cinematography, Sound Effects Editing, Make-up, Original Score, and Sound.",8,1,4,4 March 2005
Predator," Schwarzenegger's Best Film
","I truly believe that this is Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film to date. I know that's saying a lot, but I did like it better than The Terminator, which is a close second.Predator follows a group of commandos who are hired by the CIA to go on a rescue mission and take out terrorists on the way. But they encounter a problem after all the bad guys have been taken down. It seems that the people they were going to save have been slaughtered by something unknown.One by one each member of the team becomes the prey for this thing that no one can see and no one can kill. All we know is that it can bleed, which means there must be a way to stop it.The film keeps you on the edge of your seat from the moment the commandos arrive to the end when we finally get a good look at the Predator.I highly recommend this to any action or sci-fi movie fan. Fans of Schwarzenegger already know how great it is, so I'm sure they're wondering when he'll make another film as good as this.",10,2,3,23 August 2005
Gone with the Wind," One of the Greatest Epics Ever Made
","The movie is about a woman who must deal with the Civil War. She's a beautiful woman but the man she loves is going to marry her cousin.
She decides that at a party she will try to make the man she loves marry her instead of her cousin. But she doesn't know that another man is in the same room that she is in. That man ends up being the one she marries. They have a fun life together. But the woman is too selfish to admit her true feelings for the man.
The ending is very amazing. From the beginning with the romances, to the intermission with the fantastic speech, to the final words at the end, Gone with the Wind is not to be missed. It's an excellent film and it's one of my favorites. It has many great performances. Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, the woman. Clark Gable plays Rhett Butler, the man she marries. Leslie Howard plays Ashley Wilkes, the man she loved. Olivia de Havilland plays her cousin. And Hattie McDaniel plays the wonderful maid, who gives Scarlett advice from time to time. The film won a total of eight Academy Awards and two special awards. It was a record at the time. The awards were for Picture, Director, Actress, Supporting Actress, Screenplay, Art-Direction, Cinematography, and Editing. It was also nominated for Actor, Supporting Actress, Score, Sound, and Special Effects.",10,6,10,10 July 2004
Lawrence of Arabia," A Magnificent Motion Picture
","This excellent epic is the biography of T.E. Lawrence. A newcomer named Peter O'Toole plays the title role. O'Toole gets a job as an observer with Alec Guinness. Guinness plays the leader of an Arab tribal army.O'Toole helps Guinness and his actions are recorded by a journalist played by Arthur Kennedy. The rest of his life is a legendary one. And you'll have to see it to get the greatness that the film is.It really is a grand spectacle that you have to see to believe. Every scene is like a painting by the best of artists. The film again shows what David Lean can do as a filmmaker. The film won seven Oscars including Picture, Director, Art-Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Score, and Sound. It lost the awards for Actor, Supporting Actor (Omar Sharif), and Adapted Screenplay.",10,1,4,28 July 2004
Patton," A Realistic Look At Patton's Life
","This movie is another biography. This time it's about General George S. Patton, who was a famous tank commander during World War II. The film begins with Patton (George C. Scott) in North Africa. It continues with the invasion of Germany and the fall of the Third Reich. There are touches of Patton losing his temper towards insubordination. The faults that he makes eventually lead to Patton being relieved as an Occupation Commander of Germany.George C. Scott is marvelous in his best film. He finally won his Oscar for this performance, but he didn't want to accept it. In my opinion, Karl Malden is a little better as Patton's trusting friend, General Omar Bradley.Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay and Franklin J. Schaffner directed it, but they couldn't get the film made because Patton's wife wouldn't allow it. Once she died, they were able to make it. Schaffner made some great films, but this is definitely his best.The film won seven Oscars including Picture, Director, Actor, Original Screenplay, Art-Direction, Editing, and Sound. It was nominated for Cinematography, Visual Effects, and Score.",9,1,4,29 July 2004
Rocky," Passion and Inspiration
","Rocky is the story of a down and out boxer who's actually really good. People don't recognize this, but finally a trainer takes him under his wing. Apollo Creed, the world champion boxer, decides to get an unknown to fight with him in the ring and chooses Rocky. Now Rocky has his chance at the top and he'll work harder than ever to be the champion.The great thing about this movie is the fact that it works on so many levels. On the outside, it's a sports movie that will inspire even a king to become greater than he his. On the inside, it's a love story. Rocky and Adrian are one of the most memorable couples in film history and their love seems to be real. It's not just your average sports movie or love story though. This is the finest you'll ever see, even if you don't like boxing or romances.The soundtrack probably has the most uplifting song you'll ever hear. 'Gonna Fly Now' was exactly the kind of song that a movie like this needed. Today, everyone knows it and will hum the tune and even run up steps if they can find any. That's when you know you have a classic on your hands. It will stand the test of time perfectly and will live on as one of the greatest movies ever made. With all of those combinations, audiences were amazed with the tale of Rocky Balboa's dream of becoming a champion and his friends who helped him along the way. There's something else that makes this movie work more than anything else before or after it. It was released around the same time when the United States was celebrating its 200th birthday. This is the kind of movie that helped promote the American Dream and showed that our country was still the best. It was quite a way to show patriotism and unity when we needed it.Nowadays, it seems like Rocky is branded as another Stallone movie with so many sequels. Those sequels kind of ruined the reputation that Rocky should have, and we all learned how important a good rep is when we listened to Rocky's speech. So the next time you see this and think its just another excuse to make money, just take the film by itself and then you'll see how well made and well acted this film really is.",10,1,1,18 June 2006
Some Like It Hot," Pretty Perfect
","The St. Valentine's Day Massacre! No one would dare make a comedy set against the backdrop of this brutal gangland event of the 1920s, right? Well, if that were true we wouldn't have one of the funniest movies ever made. Who else but Billy Wilder could take a serious subject like that and turn it into the hysterical comedy romp that is Some Like It Hot? I was never a big fan of Marilyn Monroe as a leading lady, but this movie is my exception. She's actually quite good, but surprisingly, she's shown up by the other two leading 'ladies.' For some reason, men dressing in drag has always been extremely funny to American audiences. As an American, I can't disagree.Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis know exactly how to deliver that great Wilder & Diamond dialogue. But I can't understand how only Lemmon got the Oscar recognition. I can't really choose which actor did a better job with their role and I suppose that's where Monroe comes in.I don't want to leave out the amazing supporting cast that Some Like It Hot has to offer. You have the always intimidating George Raft as the villain, the always dependable Pat O'Brien as the detective, and the always hilarious Joe E. Brown as Jack Lemmon's love interest. You'll have to see the movie to believe that last part.With all my rambling on about how funny this movie is, you're probably wondering what it has to do with the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and why the male leads are in women's clothing. Well, Lemmon and Curtis witness the killing and have to escape the clutches the men who carry it out. Along the way, they run into Marilyn Monroe and some of the funniest lines in film.If you're in the moody for zany hijinks that only to notch comedy talent can provide, then search no further. Some Like It Hot will most definitely satisfy your funny bone.",10,1,2,23 July 2007
Pulp Fiction," 'This IS A Tasty Burger!'
","Pulp Fiction is a movie with many interweaving stories about corruption, redemption, and honor. It is set in Los Angeles and gives us a different look at the world of crime. In Quentin Tarantino's world, the bad guys are fast talkers with a stylized vocabulary. There's really only one hero in the film, but that doesn't stop you from liking most of the characters, especially the always excellent Samuel L. Jackson. There's nothing this guy can act poorly in. He's great in everything.As for everyone else, well John Travolta sky rocketed back into the public eye thanks to Tarantino. He was never better as the devoted hit-man to Jackson's one who has second thoughts about the profession. Uma Thurman can also thank Quentin for making her a household name, twice. She plays Mia Wallace, a very intriguing and different character that we don't get to see in many movies. Bruce Willis is the tough guy who's on the run from Mr. Wallace (Ving Rhames) after he doesn't do what he's told. As I said before, there's really only one hero in the picture and Willis pretty much fits that bill.All of the other members of the supporting cast do very well with the few scenes they have. Each one is equally memorable and even our director, Quentin Tarantino, gets bitten by the acting bug. It's Samuel L. Jackson who steals the show and that's what I remember most about this excellent movie. Of course, there is gratuitous violence and graphic language, but nothing that we don't say in everyday life. As long as you have a pleasure for dark humor, you'll enjoy this movie. It really is more of a comedy than any other genre.All in all Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece of originality. Some say Tarantino rips off from those low budget movies of the '70s, but he's really just putting all of what he learned from his childhood and creating something that comes off as nothing we've seen before. And that's all I need to enjoy a movie: something that I haven't seen before and that comes off as entirely original and creative. It's one of the best movies of the '90s.",10,0,1,14 May 2006
The Godfather: Part III," The Most Underrated Film of All Time
","The final chapter in The Godfather Saga is regarded by many people today as something that pales in comparison to the first two Godfather films. This is probably because of the acting of Sofia Coppola. But the first time I saw the film, I noticed nothing wrong with her. Even with further viewings, she seemed to be a fine actress. Now she's not the best in the film, but she's not bad at all.With that out of the way, I can get into the plot of this film. Michael Corleone (Pacino) wants to get out of his business in crime. He even goes as far as to confess to a priest about what he did at the end of the second film. This doesn't work as well as he planned. The young Vincent (Andy Garcia) now wants to follow in his Uncle Michael's footsteps. But he can only do this if Michael is there to guide him.Another reason why he can't get out is the fact that a younger mafia man, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), wants to destroy the order of the old mafia. To stop this, Michael must reluctantly give in to his nephew and also deal with the rest of his family in the process.Every character in the film, like the first two, has its purpose. And everyone provides something that the film needs to become the great movie that it is. With this, Francis Ford Coppola gives us his final, excellent part in the masterpiece that is The Godfather Saga. Without this one, there's no real closure. That's why it was necessary to make this brilliant film.",10,0,1,21 February 2005
All Quiet on the Western Front," A Frightening Look at World War I.
","The film shows the horrors of World War I through a group of young recruits. One of them is Lew Ayres who declares 'We live in the trenches and we fight. We try not to be killed - that's all.'The interesting thing about this film was that it showed what our enemies were thinking and how it affected them. Something I hadn't seen too much of when I first saw the film. It has many memorable scenes including infantrymen being mowed down by machine guns, the pacifist speech that Ayres' makes, and that haunting final scene with the butterfly. But the most memorable scene for me was when a soldier is blinded by an explosion and runs out into the crossfire. You'll have to witness this scene to get the full effect. The film won two Academy Awards (Picture and Director) and was nominated for Writing and Cinematography. It is a very powerful look at the trenches and the opposite side.",10,3,5,7 July 2004
To Kill a Mockingbird," An Excellent Coming of Age Story
","If there was ever a film about the innocence of children and the things they had to go through while growing up, this is that film. It is the quintessential coming of age story and it will never be forgotten.Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, the father of Jem and Scout. His wife passed when the children were very young and Scout doesn't remember much about her. Atticus must serve as father and mother to both of them while still trying to maintain dignity and respect as he defends a black man in 1930s Alabama.The film is based on Harper Lee's book of the same name. There are many differences between the film and novel, but the main points are kept in tact. The book had many lessons for everyone including racism and equality. The film takes those two main points and marvelously tells a tale of the prejudices inside us all.Not only is racism a factor, but also just how we look at the social classes and even people who are just different in mannerisms. To Kill a Mockingbird is many lessons wrapped into a two hour movie, but those two hours pack so much of a wallop that you'll be shaken and engrossed at many parts of the film.Each character is developed exactly the way Lee intended. Robert Mulligan's direction is nearly flawless and Gregory Peck's performance as our hero is one of the greatest in all of cinematic history. It's definitely the best film of 1962 and one of the five best of the '60s. If you have any compassion for your childhood, I urge you to see this excellent film.",10,0,2,21 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best of the New Trilogy
","Revenge of the Sith is the long awaited conclusion the Star Wars saga that began all those years ago. Of course, it doesn't seem like it was that long ago that the first Star Wars film was made and yet here we are almost thirty years later. Many things have changed, some things for the better and some not, but we still have that same heart that Lucas put into the original when we look at this film.Now nothing can compare to the amazing and beautiful films of the original Star Wars trilogy in terms of special effects, music, lines, and basically any technical aspect of the three movies. Because of that, many people that were just casual fans of those originals weren't too taken with the first prequel and some even with the second. They had their reasons and they told us what flaws the two films had and we let them beat it into our heads that there was pretty much no reason for these films to even be called Star Wars movies.Even with all of this, I stayed true to my beloved universe of Wookiees and Ewoks knowing that The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones were only different because of the over the top special effects and that they were good movies in their own way. I also knew that no matter how much those casual fans wanted to hate this last film, they wouldn't be able to do it. It may have been because they wanted a good Star Wars film again so bad that they just told themselves that it was great or maybe they truly believe that this is one of the best of the saga and that Lucas has redeemed himself. Since I could relate to the new prequels enough to love them, I knew that the latter was going to be true for me.It seems that it was true for those other fans too, because this new film is being called by some critics as the best of the series. We all know that that's impossible, even though they brought back Peter Mayhew and James Earl Jones, the real magic and warmth of the originals could never be reached. That doesn't stop this film from being the excellent story of betrayal and true love that it is.Revenge of the Sith is the perfect title for a film like this because it doesn't fool anyone into thinking it has two meanings or anything like that. It's straightforward, just like the film, and the title proves the inevitable fate that the Jedi will succumb to at some point during the Sith's rise to power. We all knew that only two Jedi were to survive the dreadful Clone Wars, and yet when the scenes of those Jedi that we didn't know too much about but loved in a mysterious way came along, we were sucked into a black hole of deep sadness for them as if we had no idea that it was coming.To me, that shows great storytelling and even if George Lucas needs some dialogue classes, the way he can shape a story and make it fit into each other like a jigsaw puzzle is astounding. The craftsmanship for the three prequels is amazing and it especially shows for this final segment as we know that if the piece doesn't fit into the puzzle, it wouldn't be right. Well that piece does fit and it makes the film the best of the new trilogy and one of the best films of the year.",7,1,4,14 November 2005
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The Best Animated Film of All Time
","This is a simple story of friendship and courage brought beautifully to life by the master of animation, Walt Disney. It follows the story of a young girl who doesn't know that she's the fairest one of all. But the evil Queen does know this and will stop at nothing to rid the world of her beauty. Even if it means losing the Queen's own beauty.The Queen sends someone to kill Snow White, but the man who has to fulfill the dirty deed cannot go through with it and sets Snow White free into the forest. She stumbles upon a vacant cottage in the heart of the wilderness. She naps there and is awakened by what she describes as little men.These men learn to love Snow White as a friend and they live together in peace until the Queen learns that the beautiful girl is still alive and must destroy Snow White herself.Even today that storyline is a little complex for most children. Yet everyone who sees it seems to love it and cherish it in their heart. It was the first of its kind and who knew that it would also end up being the best? This put Disney on the map as a major studio and also paved the way for the animated feature film.It's definitely something you can't pass up and something you must show to your own children while they are young. I know they'll enjoy it as much as we all did when we were younger and I know they'll keep a special place in their heart for it because it's not only the best animated film, but also one of the best movies of all time.",10,3,5,3 October 2005
Halloween," The Best of the Teenage Horror Films
","Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He takes out his problems on his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. This is just the start of things to come from Michael Myers.Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who's been studying Myers for years. He knows that something is different about him, something mysteriously evil. This evil will not be contained, and it cannot be stopped.After an escape from an institution, Myers tracks down his younger sister. If he kills her, there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy. But he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way. He manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs.There have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer. But this one started it all, sort of. If you think about it, most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chasing around half naked girls. Well, if it wasn't for Halloween, those characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were children.Halloween's director, John Carpenter, got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s. This films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.This film may seem cliché today, but back then there wasn't much out there like this. It's been copied from and ripped off of, but Halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie. It still gives you chills listening to Carpenter's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy Michael Myers.",10,49,74,8 May 2005
Ben-Hur," A Grand Epic
","Charlton Heston plays a rich Jewish prince who lives in Jerusalem at the beginning of the first century. He's good friends with Stephen Boyd, who becomes the new governor and commander of the Roman Legion.But when a brick falls off of Heston's house, it lands very close to Boyd. He knows it wasn't meant to happen. But he decides to send Heston to the galleys and his mother (Martha Scott) and his his sister (Cathy O'Donnell) to prison. But Heston swears to come back and seek his revenge.The movie seems to be remembered only for the chariot race. But it has so much more than just that one scene. A few of the scenes that I remember include the encounter between Heston and his mother and sister as he finds out they have become lepers, the scene where Jesus gives Heston water as he falls, and the scene where Heston gives Jesus water when he falls.It's one of William Wyler's greatest achievements. And it will go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever made.The eleven Oscars that it won secured it's place. It holds the record for the most Oscars, only to be tied in the last ten years. It won the awards for Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), Art-Direction, Cinematography, Costume Design, Special Effects, Editing, Score, and Sound. It only lost the award for Best Adapted Screenplay.",10,0,2,26 July 2004
The Deer Hunter," A Tearjerker For Men
","I saw The Deer Hunter at a young age, knowing that it had won all of those Oscars and that it had earned its place among the elite films of the 1970s. Going into it, you can tell that I thought it had a lot to live up to. Its reputation had become pretty big and I think that if it were any other film, it wouldn't have worked. That's right, I loved this movie.It opens beautifully and simply with a wedding. We see and get to know each character through their conversations with the others and their reactions to everything that's going on. That environment brings out the true emotions of these people and the movie really couldn't have done it in a better way. It was a brilliant decision to start the film with something that would show us exactly what we're getting into and what the filmmakers are setting us up for.We are then led to the everyday lives of the characters. They're steelworkers, hunters, husbands, and friends. They're your friends. They're the people YOU know, the people YOU love. The film goes so far in depth that it seems as if YOU are a character as well. You feel what they feel and you believe what they believe. You're taken in by these average Americans and you live their lives.Having just made so many friends while in Pennsylvania, you realize what the movie is about to do to you. You're about to be taken on a journey into the 'heart of darkness.' With other war movies, you learn about each character as the battle rages on. That's where this one is different. You already know who you're fighting with and that you're not alone.That's what makes this film so powerful. It builds everything up to the point that you know and love each character. you actually CARE about each character so that when something tragic happens, it's the end of the world. No other movie has ever done that to me, whether it was before I saw this or after. No film had ever made me cry, literally bring tears to the eyes of a man. You know you're dealing with something special when that happens.I won't go any further with this for fear that I might give too much away to those of you who haven't seen it already. If you are one of those people, then I urge you to check this movie out. You might not be as moved as I was, but I'm sure the film will stay with you for a while. Even if you're not a fan of war movies, this still works as its more of a human drama. The fact that only about one third of it is actually war may make you want to see it and please do. It's movie-making at its best.",10,1,2,28 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," 'May The Force Be With You' - And Also With You
","Originally, this was my favorite film. It has since been overtaken, but it remains at the number two spot. Originally, this had the greatest special effects money could buy. Of course, we now see what it has spawned and we wonder if it was such a good thing. Originally, this was just a story of good and evil, of youth learning, and of science fiction's maturity. Now, we see that the story of a boy following in the footsteps of his father had five other films to go with it.I stress the word 'originally' because of the fact that this film has been tweaked countless times in the past thirty years and it doesn't seem like the original film exists. It's really the only one that should because that's the version that became the phenomenon. That's the version that won all of those Oscars and that's the version that I, like so many others, first saw.Why is it so important for this film to be seen the way it was first shown, you ask? Just look at what it has done to society and what this small film has accomplished in its short life. You won't have to look far to see that Star Wars has influenced almost, if not everything, to come after it. The 'Citizen Kane' of the 1970s was one of the original blockbusters and the first science fiction film in over twenty years to be taken seriously.You know what it has become, so what was it originally? Star Wars was the story of a boy who longs for adventure. He wants a life away from the farm. He yearns to discover new worlds, new cultures, and experience what it's like to grow up. At its heart, this the all-American story of chance and opportunity. On the outside, however, it doesn't look so simple. We see battles being fought, royalty being rescued, wizards performing their magic, and good triumphing over evil.Yes, Star Wars has it all. Science Fiction may be its classification, but don't judge too soon. For those wondering whether to go ahead and finally watch the film for the first time, I urge you to follow through. You're journey will truly be one to remember as you see what everyone else has been talking about. I do impress upon you the fact that seeing the original is of the utmost importance. If you've seen and used the technology today, it may seem like you're playing Atari, but when you look back after thinking about what it had to offer and the feelings it gave you, you'll realize how awesome this movie is.",10,0,1,23 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," 'Do Or Do Not. There Is No Try.'
","The best science fiction film of all time has its story continued in this just as excellent sequel. By now, I'm sure most people have either seen this or have at least seen scenes from it and you probably all know the story and that it was a huge success. For those of you that have not had the pleasure to view this film, I shall do my best to persuade you to seek this one out. Of course, if you haven't seen the first film, and by that I mean the original 1977 entry, then get that under your belt first so you aren't completely lost.The last part of that last statement may not actually happen because of the way the film is made. Even though it pretty much picks up where first one left off, you can put this film by itself and still be highly entertained and greatly impressed.There are a lot of things to love about The Empire Strikes Back. The villain, Darth Vader, is better than ever. His dialogue may be some of the best ever written. Lines like 'You have failed me for the last time' and 'Don't make me destroy you,' when taken into context, really blow you away as far as meaning and even enunciation. James Earl Jones is definitely a candidate for our greatest voice of all time.Vader's not the only one spouting out great lines. A new character, in the form of a Muppet, might just steal the show. The fact that you are watching a puppet teach Luke Skywalker the ways of the force and you totally buy it really goes to show you how creative this movie is. The mannerisms of Yoda are so spot on that you think you're actually watching a person.A movie with the greatest villain of all time and the best use of a puppet can't have any more to offer, right? You tell me that again once you've seen the Battle of Hoth through the eyes of the soldiers staring down those AT-ATs. As soon as you've seen that, you may claim that you've seen everything. Why more movies don't use miniatures and stop-motion animation is beyond me. After this film set the bar as high as it did, you'd think people would want to have their epic films at least look realistic like this one.If those amazing feats aren't enough for you, try dodging asteroids while being chased by TIE Fighters, searching through the murky swamps of Dagobah in search of the greatest of all Jedi masters, or fighting the Dark Lord of the Sith atop Cloud City. Yes, The Empire Strikes Back has enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat for the duration.For those of you who like a little more substance with your style, look no further. As I said before the dialogue is crisp and really makes you think. The romance between Han and Leia may have as much tension as that climactic lightsaber fight. Even the comedy is well played and timed. The movie also has one of the best, if not the best, ending ever shot on film.The Empire Strikes Back is one for the ages. A film so jam-packed with literal awesomeness that you may need to pick up your jaw when the end credits start rolling. Crank up the sound, sit back, relax, and then prepare to get blown away by the second, or possibly fifth, chapter in the Star Wars saga.",10,0,1,25 January 2007
Back to the Future," 'Oh Hi, Marty!'
","Back to the Future is probably the best and quintessential time traveling movie ever made. You can't go far without someone spouting out its memorable dialogue and imitating its wonderful characters. Now that it's over twenty years old, Back to the Future is entertaining a whole new generation.It has a simple enough story that involves a teenager who longs for a better life and the crazy scientist friend who builds a time machine. When the scientist's unveiling of a time machine made out of a DeLorean goes awry, the teenager ends up accidentally going back in time thirty years. While he's there he sees all of the people he knows from 1985, except they're now thirty years younger.A genius story like that creates an excellent movie and a star making performance by Michael J. Fox as the teenager. The highlight of this movie comes from the scientist played by Christopher Lloyd. His whacky antics were perfect for the role and made the character of Doc Brown immediately come to life.Some viewers today may think that an '80s movie that ends up becoming a '50s movie won't be for them. Those people are sorely mistaken, because if you're looking for a wild ride that will keep you entertained and in stitches, look no further. Back to the Future has everything you crave.",10,1,2,16 August 2006
