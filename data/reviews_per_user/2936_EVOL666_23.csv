The Devil's Advocate," I HATE KEENU, BUT I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE
","**possible spoiler**i have to say that although i hate Keanu Reeves, this movie is suprisingly good.this movie touches on a lot of subjects, from greed, to religion, to human depravity, and does so with a light-hearted touch (thanks to the always 'over-acting' style of Pacino) that keeps this movie fast-paced and enjoyable. this is another film that can sometimes cross the line between good- hearted, fun horror and truly disturbing subject matter. not many films can pull this off, but i feel this one does it masterfully.the only gripe i have is that i feel the movie should have ended when Keanu's character shot himself. I feel this would have been a much more shocking and poignant ending then the whole 'redemption' theme that was touched on with the ending that you see in the film.all-in-all good, fun, somewhat psychological horror.  8/10",Null,1,2,27 September 2003
The Blair Witch Project," Don't Go See This One Drunk...
","I tend to like to sneak some liquor in when I go to the theater - makes me feel more like I'm watching it at home but on a bigger screen and usually makes the screening process more enjoyable...not so with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. This film had more shakes then a Tijuana hooker. I literally felt sea-sick from all the shaky camera-work (the cheap bourbon may have played a part too - but I doubt it...). I know this was a micro-budget film and that the 'real' feel is supposed to be what makes this films so 'great' - it just made my stomach hurt.This one is about a group of kids who venture into the woods of Frederick County, Maryland (where I just so happen to reside...) in search of some mythical witch. There's also some side-story about a crazy old guy that abducts kids, but honestly, it's been so long since I've seen this one that I don't even remember what that whole thing was about. In fact, I've lived here for quite a while and have never heard anything about any Blair Witch in the first place, but that's another story. The kids go into the woods and they disappear, and the premise of the film is that what the audience sees is the 'found footage' (much like the basic storyline of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST)...The same reason that I give this film credit is the very same reason that I hate it - MARKETING. This film had the most ingenious marketing techniques and 'hyping' that I've ever personally witnessed for a theatrical release. The endless bombardment of commercials, the 'true' documentaries - everything about how this film was marketed was absolutely brilliant. Which brings me to my major gripe with the film...It didn't live up to the hype. The first two-thirds of the film is boring footage of the three adventurers getting ready for their trip, and then walking in circles in the woods - all shot through a hand held camera that looks as though the person holding it has Parkinson's disease. The very end of the film is relatively 'creepy', but I couldn't figure out how it tied in to the rest, and honestly don't care to bother trying to piece it together.I give the filmmakers credit for pulling off such a hugely successful film with no budget, and I like the idea of an independent film being shown theatrically - but THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT just wasn't scary, and in my opinion is THE MOST over-hyped film I've ever seen. 3/10",3,1,4,9 February 2006
Come and See," One Of THE Most Powerful Films I've Ever Seen...
","First off - I will readily admit my 'ignorance' to the actual historical facts of the state-of-affairs in Europe and Russia during the time-frame in which COME AND SEE is set. I do know 'some' of what was going on during WWII (as I'm not a completely illiterate moron...) but I won't even begin to try to come off as erudite as some reviewers who obviously know FAR more about world-history than I do. Instead - I will approach this review strictly from the viewpoint of a film-fan. That said - COME AND SEE is definitely one of the most harrowing films that I've ever come across. Being mainly an 'underground' horror fan - I've made it my life's work to seek out the most sickening, disturbing, twisted, nihilistic films that could possibly be laid to film - and honestly - the few films that have actually 'touched a nerve' with me, typically are not by definition 'horror' films at all - but then again - if these types of films can't be considered in the realm of 'horror' - then what truly can??? COME AND SEE revolves around Flor - a young boy living in Beylorussia during WWII. We learn early on that Flor is eager to 'fight the good fight' of his countrymen against the pending onslaught of German invading soldiers, but unfortunately for Flor - he is unexpectedly thrust into situations that he could not have possibly been ready for - as I'm sure is the case in reality for anyone who experiences war first-hand. To avoid spoiling any of the truly memorable scenes - I will just say that the rest of the film is spent following Flor as he single-handedly escapes his own death numerous times until the conclusion, where he meets back up with his comrades...I don't even know where to begin with all the good points about COME AND SEE. The acting is INCREDIBLE by everyone involved - more-so than I would have ever thought possible from such young actors (particularly) portraying such complicated and devastating roles and situations. The cinematography is incredibly bleak and perfectly captures the hopeless and helpless environs of war-torn Russia (at least I guess they do - as I wasn't there...) - there is not one second in the film where you question the authenticity of the surroundings. There is really no 'gore' to speak of - but the more 'horrifying' scenes are captured so perfectly, that no amount of 'blood-n-guts' could have really made the film better (and this coming from a certifiable gore/sleaze-head). If I had to pick ANY negative issues with the film - I would say that there are scenes in the beginning that are SO haunting, that towards the middle the film loses a bit of momentum, causing even some of the stronger end-scenes to not have as much 'power'. I also feel that the very last sequence (shooting the Hitler picture mixed with actual Holocaust footage) was a bit of propaganda-overkill that was unnecessary as I felt that I had already CLEARLY gotten the message. Those two aspects alone drop COME AND SEE a half point in my book. But regardless - this is an ABSOLUTELY incredible film that I can't recommend enough - just understand that you will most likely come away from it emotionally drained - which to me is one of the highest achievements that cinema can provide...9.5/10",9,23,33,16 July 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Absolutely Brutal And Honest (and Brilliant...) 'Cautionary Tale'
","I don't know why I'm just now getting around to reviewing this film - it truly is a modern masterpiece and one of the most powerful films I've ever seen - and I watch a lot of this kind of thing. Anyone who has gone through addiction or personally has a friend or family member that has should be able fully relate to this film - and those that haven't should look at REQUIEM FOR A DREAM as a realistic portrayal of the devastating effects of drug abuse. I will keep my synopsis brief, as no words I could come up with could possibly describe the sheer 'rawness' and honesty of this film...Harry, Marion, and Tyrone are kids who are recreational drug users - a little pot here, a little blow there, a taste of H once in a while...no big deal at first. Then the friends decide to deal heroin to make some cash and begin 'sampling the goods' a little too often. Soon the group is spiraling into the descent of lies, denial, and sheer madness that is hardcore drug addiction. Meanwhile, Sara (Harry's mother), is fighting her own addiction to diet pills and is swiftly losing the battle. Everyone involved is on a one-way path of self-destruction until the shocking and harrowing conclusion.REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is honestly one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. Being able to identify with this film - I can attest to the realism of some of the things portrayed and feel that it is one of the best 'cautionary tale' pictures ever made. As graphic and unrelenting as some of the scenes are - I feel that this film should be mandatory viewing for high-school aged kids as a big 'WHAT-NOT-TO-DO-WITH-YOUR-LIFE' piece of education. I can't recommend REQUIEM highly enough - 10/10",10,0,1,13 March 2006
The Ring," one of THE BEST horror movie of the past 10 years
","I F**KING LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! i can't think of a single movie (especially in the horror genre) that had me as totally enthralled as THE RING. i'm seriously into horror movies, from extreme imported splatter/gore films to 60's exploitation flicks, but this is an incredibly inventive, scary movie. i think one of the things that works so well is the fact that the more investigating Rachel (the main character) does, the more the story changes and unfolds. impossible to guess ahead because of all the twists in plot, and the ending is absolute genius. some may find this tedious and possibly even boring-you really have to pay attention to follow along with the story, and more than likely will take MANY future viewings to really understand the story line. but that again is one of the things that i found fascinating about this movie. the more you watch, the more things will become clear. I could go on for days about this film but will leave it at this... Great movie, can't think of a single flaw 10/10 - Perfect...",6,0,1,27 September 2003
Shaun of the Dead," Not Bad...
","SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a decent movie with some comedy and horror elements, but personally I feel that this film is pretty over-rated. The story is about Shaun, a likable loser who's girlfriend just dumped him. Ed is his slovenly 'partner-in-crime', and when the town becomes over-run by zombies, Shaun scoops up his girlfriend Liz, and they all head to the bar (!) to 'hole-up' and defend themselves.Definitely some good humorous scenes, but very lacking in the gore department. After all the hype this film received I have to honestly say I was kinda disappointed. A pretty fun and funny horror/comedy, but I'll stick with Peter Jackson's far superior BRAINDEAD. Anyone who has seen SHAUN but not BRAINDEAD should definitely check the latter out. Far more hilarious and tons more gore. A generous 7/10 for SHAUN",7,1,3,12 October 2005
Hostel," Solid Second Film For Eli Roth
","OK...forget all the hype...I'll give you the real deal about HOSTEL. Now of course I am one of the seemingly few who actually also liked CABIN FEVER, so I guess you'll have to take that with a grain-of-salt as well, but I think HOSTEL was a good second film for a director who definitely shows some serious potential...HOSTEL starts off with 2 friends back-packing through Europe. During their 'adventures', they meet a European 'drifter' kinda guy and they all decide to pal around and check out the sights. They do the types of things that any young, single guys would do (namely - smoke dope and check out the hookers...) and while in Amsterdam they hear of this great place in Slovakia that houses all the hot poonanny. Sho' nuff they get to the joint and it's drippin' with hot European ass. The guys are all having a great time, until after a night of heavy partying with a couple of Euro-ho's - their drifter buddy disappears. This kinda worries the two Yankee cats as Euro-boy didn't bother to say any good-byes...but they chalk it up to the drifter mentality and try to put it out of their minds. Well, another hard night of partying goes on, and one of the American dudes disappears, too. This leaves the other American guy with no idea what's going on and he's obviously more than a little concerned about his homey's well being. The remaining American guy starts nosin' around as things seem pretty fishy, and one of the Euro-ho's tells the Yank that his boy is at an art exhibit. She takes him to some abandoned looking sh!t-hole place (keep an eye out at this point for a brief cameo by Japanese uber-director, Takashi Miike...) and tells him to go and find his boy. Obviously, the place is no art museum, and as our hero goes in search of his supposedly art-loving friend, HOSTEL really starts to take off...Honestly, I really liked HOSTEL. It definitely is a little slow paced in the beginning, but I think that this was intentional (if not completely effective...) on the behalf of Roth. He said that he was going for an 'AUDITION' (hence the cameo by Miike...)type of feel to his film, and anyone that's seen AUDITION knows full-well that that film is slow as dirt until the last 15 minutes or so. Personally, I would have preferred a quicker build up or perhaps a little more 'teaser' footage in the beginning of the film. Even so, the last 30 or so minutes of HOSTEL really makes up for any lag preceding the 'climax' of the film. And even the relatively slow beginning DOES have enough hot tits-and-ass to keep the average male (or female if you roll that way...) viewer interested. When the gore DOES come, it flys pretty heavy, especially for a U.S. theatrical release film. It's nothing compared to some of the more rough 'underground' films out there, but still plenty of red-stuff for a mainstream film. Also, many people gripe about Roth's use of 'frat-boy' style humor in his films. I personally think he does a good job of handling the funny moments and does a good job of knowing when to turn them on or off depending on the vibe of the scene. Not many directors can handle balancing comedic timing and horror in the same film, but Roth does it admirably well. Overall, HOSTEL is one of the better horror films of 2005 and is definitely worth a peep for any horror fan. It appears to already be another 'love-it-or-hate-it' film (much like CABIN FEVER...) so I'm sure the debate on this one will go on for a while, but I give HOSTEL a very solid 8.5/10...",8,1,2,16 January 2006
Oldboy," Stylish Tale Of Revenge...
","I've heard a lot of mixed things about OLDBOY - Some consider it a modern violent masterpiece, others say it's MTV-generation garbage. I personally enjoyed this one, but wouldn't rank it up there as a modern 'classic'...OLDBOY tells the story of Oh-Daesu, a man who is kidnapped and kept confined for 15 years. He's given no explanation during his imprisonment, but is given food and a television to watch. After 15 years, he's released, and his captor gives him clues as to his identity and why he chose to kidnap him - and gives him 5 days to find the answers. Of course our 'hero' is pretty irate, and begins his hunt for revenge. Along the way Oh-Daesu meets a young lady who accompanies and assists him on his quest. To say anymore about the plot or characters involved would give away some of the better 'twists' of the film...OLDBOY is a stylishly filmed take on an old subject - revenge. There are several (sometimes ludicrous) turns-of-plot that make this one a little more 'unique' than your average revenge film. A lot of suspending of reality is going to be necessary to enjoy OLDBOY - but taken for what it is, it's an enjoyable film. The reason behind Oh-Daesu's imprisonment, and his subsequent handling of the information is strange and alarming. His relationship with his young female companion and how the situation is explained and eventually 'resolved' also opens up some questions about Oh-Daesu's status as either a 'hero' or very sick individual - but the end is ambiguous enough to interpret however you choose. OLDBOY is not as violent as many have made out (which was a disappointment in my book...) - with most of the more 'rough' scenes being implied as opposed to actually shown. Anyone familiar with films like ICHI THE KILLER, BATTLE ROYALE, etc...won't see anything in this film that they haven't seen before. Definitely worth a look - 8/10",8,8,84,24 February 2006
Silent Hill," I Hate Everyone Who Recommended This Film To Me...
","I didn't have very much interest in this film to begin with - until several of my friends saw it in the theater and said how good it was. Well - they were all wrong. Other than a few well-executed scenes - SILENT HILL was boring, hard to follow, laden with ineffective CGI and horrible performances by the actors involved. I typically don't watch a lot of U.S. theatrically-released horror films, preferring more 'underground' material and older exploitation type films - but every once in a while I'm impressed with something that hits the 'mainstream'...this is not one of those cases...A little girl has strange dreams about a place called SILENT HILL, and when her mother notices strange behavior, including sleepwalking and drawing 'creepy' pictures, she decides to take her daughter to the supposedly haunted town in search for answers. When she gets there, the town is deserted (or so it seems...) and her daughter disappears after they run off the road. The remainder of the film is about the mother's search for her daughter and the truth behind her daughter's dreams, and the town in general...Honestly - the above synopsis is about all I could make of the film. The story is convoluted and confusing and ultimately centers around witch-hunting and other played-out themes. I remember playing the video-game several years ago and liking it quite a bit - but 95% of the events that took place in the film, I have no recollection of from the game. The acting is some of the worst I've seen from a big-budget film - almost EVERY line coming out of EVERY actor's mouth seeming so wooden and cliché as to be actually infuriating. The CGI is FAR over-done and many scenes would have been more effective had they been a bit more understated. The good points - a few decent scenes and set-pieces that were suitably 'creepy' and kept true to the atmosphere of the game, but seriously - that's it - and unfortunately, that doesn't carry a film for me. I've definitely seen FAR worse films, but I really enjoyed pretty much nothing about SILENT HILL. I understand that it has a lot of supporters, though I can't possibly understand why - personally, I'd say to skip it unless pretty much everything else is out at the video store or play the game instead...3/10",3,2,7,1 September 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Well-Made And Violent Re-Imagining Of Craven's 'Classic'
","NOTE: This review is based on the 'uncut' DVD version...So I finally got around to seeing this after everyone told me how good it was. I have to say that it's one of the stronger theatrically-released horror films that I've seen and was a decent mix of good story, decent acting, and strong violence. I haven't seen the original in years and don't remember much about it, so I'm not going to bother trying to compare the two...A family is on vacation traveling to San Diego and get stuck in the New Mexico desert. Turns out the 'accident' that caused their break-down wasn't an accident at all, and the family is being stalked by a band of nuclear-mutated cannibalistic freaks...There's really not much that I didn't like about this film. There's a good bit of relatively graphic violence, some tense moments and once it gets going, stays pretty 'intense'. The mutant make-up FX are good for the most part, though a few of the mutants were kinda goofy looking. I typically prefer more 'underground' horror films, but THE HILLS HAVE EYES ('06) is definitely a solid film and worth a look. Seems to me that after the success of both HIGH TENSION and now this film, Aja may be one of the new 'mainstream' horror directors to keep an eye on...8.5/10",8,0,2,29 June 2006
The Exorcist," A HORROR MASTERPIECE
","because i love this movie so much, i will keep my feelings of this film to a bare minimum...this is one of only a very small handful of movies that i deem truly scary. superb casting, acting, camerawork and effects make for a movie way beyond it's 1973 time stamp.  this movie still stands the test of time and is THE standard by which all other psychological horror movies will be judged.
if you like the performances in this film, watch 'Requiem For A Dream' which co-stars Ellen Burstyn.  not a horror film but absolutely disturbing in it's depiction of the horrors of drug addiction 11/10 for The Exorcist- an all-time great...",Null,2,3,27 September 2003
Saw III," Suitably Gory - Weak Storyline...
","This third entry in the SAW series amps up the gore over the other two entries, and dumbs down the plot a bit. Seems like this series is having a bit of an internal conflict with itself, as it can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a thriller, or a balls-out gore-fest. I like the way that the deaths are getting more graphic, but it's definitely at the expense of a solid storyline.This one has 'Jigsaw' on his death-bed, and he and his apprentice kidnap a surgeon to sustain Jigsaw's life until his final guinea-pig either succeeds or fails in his trap-challenge. The 'competitor' is a father whose son was killed by a driver who got off after only six months of jail-time, and Jigsaw's 'game' is to promise vengeance for the father - if he makes it through a series of obstacles...SAW III started off great - two rough scenes in the first 15 minutes or so, then it starts to slow down a bit. The story about Jeff (the father), while providing some decent gore-gags, didn't do much for me story-wise. I honestly felt no kind of connection to him, his plight, and really didn't care whether he lived or died. I think if it weren't for the elaborate death set-ups, I probably wouldn't have cared for this one at all. Luckily, the kills and traps are inventive enough to be entertaining, and there are some tense moments as you wait to find out the fate of each person who comes into the picture. The ending was a bit uninspired and I found it a bit confusing and implausible. Of the three - I enjoyed this the original the least (two slow, not enough pay-off), the second the best (good mix of decent storyline and cool traps), and this third one is in the middle. I really dug the gore, but the story-line just didn't work for me. Either way, I'd recommend it for gore fans, or fans of the series. The uncut version of SAW III shows that there may be hope for gory, Hollywood-made horror afterall...7.5/10",7,0,1,30 January 2007
28 Days Later...," Solid 'Zombie' Entry
","28 DAYS LATER is not a 'zombie' film per se, it is actually about people who become infected with a virus that makes them act zombie-like. The story centers around a small group of people who have managed to dodge the virus and look for safety in a city that is quickly becoming over-run with these 'things'. When the group finds that there is really no safe place in the city, they decide to make a mad dash for supplies and then to run for the country-side, hoping that there will be less of a virus-riddled population there. They then come upon a military installation who vow to protect them, but being that one of the group is the only female to be found, things quickly turn sour.Very little to complain about in 28 DAYS LATER. The one big problem I had is how the 'action' sequences were filmed. Whenever any violence was shown on film, the camera would shake uncontrollably, and you could see no details of what was happening. This tends to annoy the sh!t out of me, because I like to see the graphic action up-close without the 'cut-aways' or shaky camera tricks. I realize that it seems to be the trend nowdays to do weird camera tricks, but I still hate it. Not enough to ruin the film, but knocked it down a point in my book. Pretty original story, great performances - an all-around winner. Check this one out...8/10",8,2,4,17 October 2005
The Evil Dead," A Masterpiece Of Low-Budget Horror Film-Making
","Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD is one of the best examples ever made of what can be done on a small budget. Acting is great, FX are great, story is great, and even the cinematography and style are great. The story is pretty simple: some friends go to a cabin in the woods and find a strange book and some tapes in the basement. Turns out the book is the fabled NECRONOMICON, a tome that was created for the purposes of black magic and summoning demons. When the campers start fooling around with the book and tapes, they unknowingly unleash the demonic hordes! THE EVIL DEAD is truly a horror classic. Bruce Campbell is excellent as ASH (a role he reprised for EVIL DEAD 2, and ARMY OF DARKNESS). The gore and other FX still hold up to this day, and is still a blast to watch. If you haven't seen this one, you know nothing about horror! 9/10",9,2,5,17 October 2005
Saw II," More Fun And Games From JIGSAW...
","Honestly, I wasn't a big fan of SAW. I liked the twist-ending, but felt it took too long to get there and didn't really hold my interest that well. The acting also seemed kind of wooden and unrealistic - but I will admit that I did enjoy SAW 2 quite a bit. This is the film that I was expecting the first one to be and was disappointed, the sequel did what it needed to to amp up the whole SAW concept and add some more dimensions...Same basic idea as the first film: JIGSAW puts people in life-or-death situations that ultimately those playing the 'game' have control over - if they are willing to go all the way to 'win'. The main difference is that this one has several 'players' as opposed to just 2 from the first film. This keeps the action more dynamic and fast-paced, and offers the audience a look at a wider variety of inventive 'traps'...I feel that everything about SAW 2 was superior to the first. The action was better, the 'traps' were better, the ending was suitably twisted, and the acting was all-around more believable. I don't know where the franchise will go from here - but obviously by the way the end was handled, it's apparent that a part 3 is in the works. I guess we'll see if they can keep the ball rolling in a believable and interesting manner - but if the next one is nearly as good or better than part 2, then it should prove to be a damn good horror film...8.5/10",8,1,2,17 March 2006
Paranormal Activity," Moral Of The Story: Don't Date Broads That Have Demons Following 'Em...
","After hearing all the 'hype'-both positive and negative regarding PARANORMAL ACTIVITY-I finally felt the need to subject myself to the 'experience' of this film...A young couple who have been together for a few years moves into a new home. The female of the couple claims to have had some sort of demonic/ghostly experiences throughout her life. The boyfriend is more than skeptical, until weird things start to happen...I guess this sort of thing is scary if you're susceptible to such things. I'm not bagging on anyone's views on this sort of thing-but I'm not a believer. I currently live in a house that is supposedly 'haunted', where several others who lived here before me have apparently had 'experiences'...and I have yet to 'experience' sh!t. But regardless of whether or not I believe in such things-I don't discount the possibility. Anyway-back to the film. There's a whole lot of nothing that happens-and then some 'freaky' things happen-and it takes a long-ass time to get there.  This film will probably freak out the teenage horror-crowd, or those that firmly believe in this sort of phenomena, but I've seen pretty much every perversion known to man either in real-life or on film...so this one didn't move me in the slightest. 'Scary' if watching seemingly endless footage of a guy and his girlfriend arguing (been there-and that's horrific enough-don't really need to re-live those portions of my life on film...)-otherwise, a total snoozer in my book. Another over-hyped BLAIR WITCH Hollywood propaganda-machine retread that will appeal to that crowd. I can't believe films like this get wide releases while thousands of other (far more worthy) films fall by the Hollywood way-side...3/10",3,0,1,25 February 2010
A Clockwork Orange," AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE!!!
","i'm not sure why this movie is listed under horror, but i feel compelled to write about it anyway.as anyone in their right mind will tell you, this is one of the most incredible movies ever made. the story line is  insanely inventive, the movie itself is very well acted; this is one of the few movies that truly creates an entirely different and believable reality and draws you in from beginning to end.built on the 'negative-utopia' platform (such as 1984 and Brave New World) it explores topics invoving juvenile delinquency, human depravity, and the flaws of the 'justice system'.Although some will find that outwardly it appears dated due to obvious '70's references and style, it is an incredible work of art that is shocking/humorous/and a cautionary tale all in one.this movie will have you reeling from beginning to end and the ending is a twisted 'Twilight-zone' style conclusion that will have you thinking for days, if not years to come.Kubrick is a master of artful storytelling, and if this film does not touch you on some level, than there really is no hope for you as a movie-goer.11/10 - untouchable",Null,1,3,26 September 2003
The Fly," Excellent Remake - Better Than The Original
","THE FLY (1986) is a great film on all counts. Cronenberg was in top form as director of this film, and his style is all over it. The story concerns Seth Brundle, played by Jeff Goldblum (who to be honest, I usually HATE, but was actually very good in this film...)who is a scientist working on a teleportation machine. He has various degrees of success and is finally ready to test his project on a human subject, and decides to use himself as the first human test subject. Everything seems OK til Seth realizes that there was fly in the transporter with him, and that they were 'combined' during the teleportation process...THE FLY hits the mark on every level. The acting, even from Goldblum (did I mention, I normally hate that guy?...) and Geena Davis (another actress that I normally HATE...) who plays Brundle's love interest, are dead on. At first it's fascinating, even fun to watch Brundle's transformation from man to 'fly-thing' (the extra strength and agility, etc...) until the process becomes accelerated and Brundle starts losing body parts in various gory ways...and there is a good bit of 'gross' stuff in this one. I remember this film being considered pretty shocking for a theatrical release when it first came out and with good reason. Cronenberg, who never really shied away from showing disturbing images, really went all the way with this one. An excellent film all-around - if you like this one, check out THE BROOD, my personal favorite Cronenberg film. Definitely recommended 8.5/10 for THE FLY",8,1,2,18 October 2005
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Do Not Believe The Hype Surrounding This Film!
","This has got to be one of, if not THE most over-hyped film ever. Many horror and extreme film lovers seek this film out because of all the references to the 'horrible' and 'disgusting' depictions of violence and deviant sex that are in Salo. Unfortunately, it's almost all bull****! This film is laughable at best- the only thing 'extreme' about this film is the extreme disappointment I felt after having sat through this garbage. If you find people eating s**t and getting p**sed on extreme - than i guess you may want to check this out for yourself. The violence is extremely understated, and the only 'graphic' violence is at the very end, and that is viewed through a pair of backwards binoculars so that i had to use the zoom mode on my t.v. to even see what the hell was going on.... I understand that this film may have been considered really racy in 1976, and I can see how your average, everyday theater goer would be shocked by the content in this film, but be honest...anyone viewing this film nowdays is only doing so because they've done the research and wants to see what all the fuss is about. This is not a film you just 'come across' at the local video store. But in my opinion - anyone who has seen any Cat III Asian films,or any of the more notorious Euro Horror/Exploit, or some of the more recent underground independent horror films from the States and abroad, will find nothing that outrageous in Salo. The only redeeming quality about this film is when the old hookers are talking about getting p**sed and s**t on- those scenes are absolutely hilarious and steal the whole show. Salo has no quality as any sort of social commentary - it's about a bunch of old f**ks that like to molest kids and eat s**t. As far as I'm concerned, Salo just doesn't have anything going for it other than the colorful dialogue of the old prostitutes, and that in and of itself does not save this film. If you are still desperate to see this over-hyped garbage, DO NOT be one of the fools that is paying as much as $1000 for a criterion copy of this film. There are plenty of dealers on-line and at the horror conventions that sell non-criterion copies for around $30 - or better yet find a $5 bootleg and at least you won't be too irritated that you wasted your money on this crap. 3/10 - but only for the s**t eating hookers!!!",3,7,17,7 September 2005
The Descent," Highly Enjoyable British Horror Entry
","From the Director of DOG SOLDIERS comes a very well made 'mainstream' horror film. I have, for the most part, given up on current theatrical horror films (with a few notable exceptions...) but THE DESCENT gives me hope that horror audiences are still interested in seeing some good ol' 'blood n' guts' with their horror films, and that these films can still be intelligent and well-done. Although this film has not yet been released theatrically in the U.S., I hear it's coming (although I'm sure it will be chopped to death...) and this is one that I would recommend to any real horror fan.Sarah and her friends are extreme sports enthusiasts who enjoy activities like rafting and caving. When Sarah's husband is the victim of a brutal accident and killed (in a scene that 'jump-starts' the film right in the first few minutes...), she has a hard time coping with the loss. Cut to 1 year later and Sarah's friends determine that it's time to help get Sarah back on her feet and into some of her old activities. They plan an 'all-girls' trip to explore a cave system in the Appalachian mountains. Little do any of the other girls know, that Juno, the organizer of the expedition, has planned a trip into a previously uncharted cave system in the hopes of claiming a little fame and recognition. This obviously isn't such a smart idea for a group of novice spelunkers, and things start to go downhill pretty quickly. Along with such setbacks as injuries, cave-ins, and the mental stress that the girls undergo when they realize that they may be in a life-or-death struggle just to get out of the caves - we then become aware that the group of explorers are not the only ones currently inhabiting the caves - and this is where the film REALLY takes off...THE DESCENT is nearly perfect in almost every way. The tension and claustrophobia of being trapped in an unknown cave system is palpable. The gore comes pretty hot and heavy in the second half of the film, and the ending of the film is appropriately surprising and bleak, without being corny. Another big plus in my book is that the 'creature' FX aren't over-the-top and don't rely on much, if any CGI. When I first heard that THE DESCENT was a 'creature' film, I was kinda worried because I feel that those types of films have gone severely down-hill with the advent of the over-use of CGI...but THE DESCENT doesn't fall into that category. Some of the acting isn't the greatest but it doesn't really detract from the film overall, and some seem to think that the first half of the film is slow. Personally, I think that the early sequences in the caves are a great 'tension-builder' as things go from bad-to-worse, and right when you think it can't go any lower, the audience is clued in to the existence of the other 'inhabitants' of the caves and and all hell breaks loose. THE DESCENT is an excellent film that shouldn't be ignored. Highly recommended - 9/10",9,27,45,2 January 2006

True Romance," One Of My ALL-TIME Favorite Films...
","Sorry kids...it don't get much better than this. TRUE ROMANCE is one of the coolest films ever made. The cast, acting, plot, cinematography - everything, is just dead-on...Clarence and Alabama are a couple o' newly-wed's who accidentally walked with a suitcase full of Alabama's ex-pimp's blow. Well, it actually wasn't his either, it actually belonged to some mob cats and now they want their sh!t back...Clarence and Alabama set of to L.A. to try to get rid of the coke, all the while unknowingly being tailed by the mob boys. Things get hairy when the cops get involved and it all just sorta 'hits the fan' from there...I can't praise TRUE ROMANCE enough. It really is one of my all-time favorite films and should definitely be considered a MUST SEE by anyone who likes a good action/comedy/drama. Since it's written by Tarantino, expect the prerequisite violence and obsessive cursing...but this is by far my favorite film that he's had anything to do with. The cast alone is a who's who: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Tom Sizemore, Michael Rappaport, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Balki from Perfect Strangers, Brad Pitt, and of course the legends themselves - Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper - who share a scene that I swear to God is one of the best in film history. If you haven't seen this film yet, you should feel hollow and empty inside...GO GRAB THIS ONE IMMEDIATELY!!! My HIGHEST recommendations for TRUE ROMANCE ---10/10 (and I don't give these out much...)",10,2,4,5 January 2006
V for Vendetta," Ballsy Stuff For A Big-Budget U.S. Film...
","I had absolutely no interest in this film. Several friends said it was good, so I gave it a look. They were right. There's some pretty inflammatory material in this film that I actually have to applaud Hollywood for backing.V FOR VENDETTA centers around a masked vigilante who employs terrorist-like techniques to try to bring down the corrupt government of futuristic England. A young girl is accidentally caught up in the mix and becomes his unwitting accomplice in his actions...There's a whole lot more to V FOR VENDETTA's plot than the above, but it's probably better to watch it knowing as little as possible. A good mix of action, social-commentary, and cautionary tale - this film is far more than the typical comic-book action-fest that is so much more common from mainstream films. All the performances are top-notch, the action sequences are well done, and the plot is well-written. Definitely worth checking out...8.5/10",8,0,1,3 September 2006
