Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The magic is back....
","I was six again.The movie is phenomenal.  The pacing seems a little slow, but that is because you cannot take the tempo of a movie, crank it to the maximum and then leave the setting there!  You have to pitch it up and down, have really slow moments and then really fast moments so that you don't get burned out a-la MTV/Armageddon crap-ola movies.The film is great, and the lightsaber duel at the end is absolutely amazing. It alone is worth the prize of admission.For those that will hate Jar-Jar, just remember almost every Disney film has the 'cute/cuddly talking/singing monkey/fish/cup/carpet/tree' that is directly aimed at younger audience members.  Besides, I though he was appropriately funny and lets not forget the fact that HE WASN'T REAL!!!!!",10,0,0,20 May 1999
