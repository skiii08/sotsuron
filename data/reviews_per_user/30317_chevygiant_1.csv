Hereditary," Visual waterboarding
","Firstly, I am easily entertained and usually find something decent about every movie I see. That was until I saw this cinematic bowl movement. I would much rather eat $40 of old Taco Bell, crap my pants on a hot day and then try to wipe my ass with a rusty cheese grater than see that movie again. I seriously can't even come up with words to describe how truly awful it was. It was worse than any 'made for cable' movie you see around Halloween every year. My mind feels violated and I am embarrassed to review this diaper filling brain rape. If my honest assessment saves just one person from this visual waterboarding, then my soul will be preserved. The writing is horrible, the casting was atrocious, the plot was insultingly ignorant. Complete waste of time and money. Please save yourself from the worst two hours of your life. If you really want to be scared, you are much better off rolling around in a puddle of thumb tacks and then submerging yourself in a construction site port-a- potty.",1,6,13,20 June 2018
