Source Code," Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen...
","This review may contain spoilers... this film is TERRIBLE!!I can't be bothered going into detail, I just wanted to record here that this film is utterly, utterly awful. Quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Just a couple of things that irked me, if Jake Gyllenhaal's character is already dead and hooked up to the machine, why did they have to set him up in that weird wrecked ship? Why did the air con in that place fail? What was the point of the stupid garbage about the cards and the opera cloak? If the source code is based on the memories of the bomb victims, how could details change so dramatically (in one version the red-head psych student got off at the stop with a bike FFS!!!)? It really is a disgrace that studio execs in Hollywood take a film that is rightly popular (Inception) and then chuck millions into any old garbage that looks vaguely enough like it to sell some product placement. Jake Gyllenhaal should be ashamed of himself for lending the credibility to this film his name brings.",1,8,18,5 August 2011
