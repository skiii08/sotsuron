Resident Evil: Afterlife," Disappointment
","For me it was a total failure... watched the entire series- all others make sense- this one do not have a logical course, the girl loses her powers but she can still take hits no human being can, she still defies the laws of physics in fights even though she is supposed to be a simple human now- erase the beginning and you won't even notice she is actually an ordinary human being. For me at least left the impression of a movie made extremely fast and without a minimum attention to details- just for commercial reasons, unlike it's predecessors which I really enjoyed. It has a ranking of 1 star from me as a punishment for not at least trying to keep the standards imposed by the first movies in the series.",1,6,15,24 September 2010
Sherlock Holmes," No originality!
","This is just my opinion, no intention to offend anyone who enjoyed the movie...***Kept spoilers to a minimum possible***Developed two hypothesis regarding this movie:1. Sherlock Holmes is a futuristic cyborg which came from the future to solve a sort-of mystical case which could change the course of history. Here's his special skills:-Incorporated matrix-like computer with less than 2 Nano-seconds response time (the fight scenes)-Fire proof skin/fire resistance aura which protects him and his friends for the devastating explosions...(the survival at the butchery)-Hyper-developed sensors which catch even the most subtle smells, also at least 8x optical zoom incorporated in his eyes (his travel to the occult organization leader, the way he sees the leader's iris from like 5-6 meters away and deduces he's related with someone...won't tell who, and others)-Titanium skeleton - no matter how beat up he is , he keeps getting back on his feet again-Huge encyclopedia stored in his brain2. He is a genetically improved human, created on the same purpose as the first hypothesis. Not only he is improved, but also have a guardian angel which protects him and his close ones by harm.He looks more like an eccentric action hero out of his time, worthy more of a comic book than a film that pretends to be serious. Seriously, is he meant to be an intelligent detective of the dark ages, or Neo from Matrix? Everything is exaggerated in this movie until the point when it gets ridiculous and ..grose.About the 'mystic' part of the movie, been there done that, virgin sacrifice, hermetic drawings all seen over and over in so many other movies.I think it's just a wannabe, a mixture of some other movies, GOOD movies. I can clearly see the resemblance with Prestige, Matrix (fighting scene), Letter from Hell (there sure are others that don't come in my mind right now)- all the three wonderful movies with a strong storyline perfectly fit within the spirit of the times it happens and even innovative ideas in my opinion- and some typical Hollywood-like themes. if you pull out the parts inspired from other movies, nothing really remains - no originality whatsoever, no idea which makes you thinking after you leave the cinema, a pretty childish copy of some more profound movies fitting in this genre.Gave it a 2 even though I would give it a 4/10 stars normally, but I think now it's too overrated.Guy Richie should stay within the genre which made him famous on merit, this is a big downside for him. He entered an unfamiliar territory, a ground on which others before him built much much more!",2,4,9,19 January 2010
