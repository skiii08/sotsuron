Sucker Punch," Very hard to digest...
","First review i've ever made on IMDb bear with me :-) I saw this movie yesterday after work, I went in thinking that visually this movie would look nice but story wise it would just be bad. My impressions were right It felt like torture watching this movie. The acting to me was just awful I didn't feel for any of the characters within the movie because their problems, how they were handled and how they came to be just either happened too quickly to make it believable or enjoyable or just was very dis-interesting.I read one of the reviews here person stating that this is a Zack Snyder movie so don't expect it to be nothing more than good as 300 or the watchmen. I do not agree with that 300 was done very well overall the story was great the action was great, and the watchmen which is based off the graphic novel so no rewrite was needed really was executed as well as it could be for what it was. But this movie is just a girl power type of movie with bad acting cheesy girl power on a mind trip music and lack of continuity. it's like 300 meets inception meets epic movie. visually it looks great like 300. to a certain extent it tries to be like inception with it's reality, sub reality and sub sub realities... But, to a certain extent executes a lot of things poorly like epic movie.Overall i give it 5 out of 10 visually it's great story wise it could've been so much better.",5,4,10,27 March 2011
