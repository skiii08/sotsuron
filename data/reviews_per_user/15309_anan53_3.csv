The King's Speech," Good
","I have experienced the same stammer problem long back due to a minor bike accident when I was 50 years old.Believe it or not i just came out of this problem within a year because of the best treatment given by my Doctor at Chennai.When my son recommended to watch this movie,i couldn't understand the reason for his telling. While watching the movie, i became the character it self and many a time i started murmuring myself(repeated) the words pronounced by the king.I got frightened myself as i may perhaps get in to the problem again.I regained my strength after the appearance of the character (speech therapist) named LionelLogue.I simply felt the happiness,pain ,joy,sufferings of the king all along the movie myself.It is just a feeling one has to feel on their own.For your information i am now totally out of this problem & i speak quite normal like everybody without the traces of stammer.I give full marks to the actor Colin Firth( KING) ,Geoffery Rush ( Speech Therapist) and the Director.Art director,camera and Music gives added beauty to the Movie.The Director plays his role ,When the king struggle to pronounce the word- people-the therapist add a simple word -a- and make it a people and make the king comfortable when delivering public speech.",10,0,1,9 March 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A Good Movie- but something is missing !
","I have been watching the development of Planet of the Apes from 70's.Other productions like Gorillas in the Mist,Project X are some of the finest creations stuck in my mind as ever green memories.I will not say this movie is bad, but still i have a feeling some thing is missing which i am not able to find out.May be the Ape looking artificial or graphical in nature .One thing i am sure is that don't miss the movie as there are lots of messages to the human race how cruel we are.The movie is really interesting from the very first frame like James Bond movies and the tempo has been maintained till the end.Eye expression of the Hero-Ape tells how sad is he/she due to the separation from their home forest & parents.Movie is filled with entertainment ,sentiments and messages .",Null,0,2,1 September 2011
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," Jodi no 1
","I happened to see this movie after 2years of release.The Story is well known to Indian audience and next scene is easily predictable as we are used to it.The Hero and Heroine are really talented but due to week story their efforts are in vain.We have seen in TV comedy serials that the Hero(comedian) used to play duel role just by replacing a sticker as mole in his cheek,for laughter. But i am surprised that how the director was bold enough to venture in to such idea of creating 2 characters using mustache as a tool just like Golmaal. kind of Movie should have been released in 80's.Hero and Heroine are dominating through out the movie.Other characters are not given any chance to play.",2,10,22,25 May 2011
