Vertigo," Chef-d'oeuvre? Why?
","I've reviewed my attitude to Vertigo, and now I'm in doubt that this is a chef-d'oeuvre.Jimmy Stewart was, of course, at his best in this movie. He even had to do nothing - only walk hither and tither and watch with his 'eyes of stone' - a famous innovation of Hitchocock. But Hitch himself, IMHO, was NOT at his best in Vertigo. I'll explain why.First of all, an experienced detective would have noticed that the girl who fell into the San- Francisco bay (what a romantic way to commit suicide! is to fell into the San-Francisco bay!.. pardon me) - that this girl has flatten her hands and doesn't sink - because she didn't want to! This was her performance. Such a detective is not as clever as he should be.Secondly, a terrible way of editing. In the scene discussed above, John takes Madeleine out of the water... now the view from the shore... he carries her in his arms... AND ANOTHER CUT! He continues to carry the girl to her car! What is the purpose of this cut? Jimmy Stewart was not strong enough to carry Kim Novak all the way from the water down to the car FOR A ONE TAKE? This is a terrible mistake that's funny to see from mr. Hitchcock. I don't know what the Master was thinking about, but this scene is unlikely, even an anecdotic one.There's one more editing mistake towards the end of the movie, where Johny and his girl returns to the hotel... a bus runs down the street... and the next cut is a view of the hotel's corridor. The wall is at the left side of the screen, and it seems that the bus runs to the wall. This is inexcusably for Hitchcock.And, of course, a scene in the tower, in which Gavin Elster's wife flyes upside down from the tower. Why Johny who claims to be the experienced detective cannot keep up with Madeleine? A huge mistake, mr. Hitchcock, very unlikely one!Whence, I can give only 5/10.",5,3,11,10 October 2012
