The Lobster," A 'Dogtooth' fan's review of 'The Lobster'
","The Lobster is a love story as revealing and disturbing to an adult as 'Romeo and Juliet' is to a child.One should absolutely get past the silliness of the situation (which is there for a reason), and he will be rewarded with a 'scientific' description of love.The Lobster script is thoroughly developed and describes all the subtle shadings of emotions that border love.As father would say:There are two distinct groups of emotions that border love (if it exists). The first group of emotions that border love (if it exists), are in random order:Group A 1.hatred 2.revenge 3.guilt 4.jealousy 5.pity and 6.fear The second group of emotions that border love (if it exists) are in random order:Group B 1.companionship 2.sexual attraction 3.friendship 4.acceptance and 5.belonging 6. survivalThe average of both groups A and B are of equal distance to love L (AL=AB). Please calculate the distance between love L and each individual emotion and provide examples from the movie 'The Lobster'...Father aside, The Lobster deconstructs both the 'forced' love of the hotel as well as the ideal of the 'Romeo and Juliet' love and deliberately avoids taking sides. If only, through it's factual approach, it promotes tolerance or at least respect for the personal pain people go through to achieve what they think is their ideal... The brilliance of the movie is that it avoids being clinical which is strange. It is completely emotionally engaging and touching in a very deep way. It manages to be so, avoiding any clich√©s in actor's performances, script or direction. It does so instead through subtlety and omission..., which I find striking. As you probably guessed by now, I'm totally thrilled about this movie and I totally sympathize with the decision of the distribution company to market it to a modern mainstream audience as a science fiction romantic comedy...The only science fiction I can see is in the demands it makes on it's viewers and it can only be a comedy in the minds of it's emotionally crippled audience.All of the above is of-course my personal opinion. This movie is more than anything else, a test of yourself. I could go on forever about 'The Lobster' but I have to get back to my fathers' car trunk.Cheers Nikitas",10,1,5,31 July 2016
