Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," this movie is soo bad i started to write a review.
","honestly, i don't know where to start, im currently watching this movie now on my split screen while im typing this, thats how much i am bored.1.The acting is soo bad & dull it looks like an acting project made by a university student, considering its a multi million project i'd say its totally a waste of money. Its really a shocking considering natalie portman the gal who has been considered a really good actor in Leon the professional delivered an awful performance.2. The plot is soo boring it makes me think i can do it better. end of story.3. This is my first star wars movie, i haven't watch episode 4, 5, and 6 and i heard its really good. but so far in episode 1 i still cant see the hype.",3,0,4,18 April 2015
