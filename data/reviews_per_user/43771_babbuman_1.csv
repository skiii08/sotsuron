First Man," Amazingly
","Boring..! How on earth do you manage to make a feature film less engaging than a documentary? No one expects Ryan Gosling to spring out of his range of 1.5 emotions, but thru the film it seems they focus too much on getting details right and totally forgot they were making a film that needs to be watchable. At least someone should ve told the director to cut out an hour or so to regain some pace. Watch it for good recreations of flight in space shuttles and moon landing.",6,0,0,7 January 2020
