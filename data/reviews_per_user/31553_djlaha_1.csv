","The film is based on the real-life conflict and bloodshed that took place twenty five years back in Kuwait, and the way it is done—with a sense of urgency and immediacy, bringing alive a city over-run and under siege—sends out a crucial message to star-driven-yet-drivel- producing Bollywood. That given the backing of an A-list star, anything is possible: well done, Akshay Kumar, for donning the producer-with- conviction hat to create a crackling film. Airlift proves that quality of Indian cinema is getting raised day by day. Akki delivered a fantabulous performance again after baby and special 26. The vandemataram anthem will surely create Goosebumps and will make you stand in the theatre. Raja Krishna menon as a debutant made a landmark. Nimrat Kaur as female lead was more than okay. Comic nuisance created by Prakash belawadi was very good. All over it can be said that the movie of the year is this. Although it will not have any award. Just go and watch the movie. I'm more than satisfied.",10,8,12,22 January 2016
