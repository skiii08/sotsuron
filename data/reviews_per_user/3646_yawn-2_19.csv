The Sound of Music," The Hills Are Alive...RUN!!!
","At age 45, I just sat through this for the first time (plus a solid HOUR of commercials) on ABC last night. After reading a few dozen IMDB reviews, I have to say that just about ALL the comments, good and bad, are fairly accurate. My personal favorite is indy-39's theory that Christopher Plummer's character has 'caused more women to enter into dysfunctional relationships and lead lonely lives in search of an unattainable male (gay?) than any other character in film history.' At last, a plausible explanation for the wasteland of my single years.I have nothing as profound to say, but here is what I can offer:1) I am devoted to Miss Andrews' 'Mary Poppins' 2) I am devoted to Mr. Wise' 'West Side Story' 3) I will see both of those films again and again before I kick off 4) I will not see 'The Sound of Music' againCapiece?",Null,2,9,28 December 2003
Ocean's Twelve," A little less conversation, a little more action please
","Since he claims he's the only guy who had no fun while making 'Ocean's 11,' Steve Soderbergh must have done this sequel either:A) For the money. Lots of money. B) Because his actor buddies begged him to. C) Because the first one was so successful he'd be allowed to do anything he wanted with a sequel.I'm voting for 'C'. He must have said under his breath: 'Well, I'm doing a sequel but I'm damn sure not making the same movie over again.'And you've got to respect that, even if it means a not-as-great final product. This one is a lot of fun but totally forgettable, where the first one was a lot of fun and you couldn't stop thinking about it (probably because it was about one possible scam instead of half a dozen impossible ones). Either flick is worth the price of a ticket - you'll never know whether or not you'll like 'em by reading other people's comments. Even though they are 'conventional movies,' they don't lend themselves to conventional analysis. They're like those awful 'star-studded' TV movies from the 70's - except extremely well executed by seriously talented filmmakers. This movie is not about master thieves; it's about cool and in-jokes and about watching really really famous, really really rich and attractive people having a great time together. The only person who actually gives a performance in 'Ocean's 12' is Catherine Zeta-Jones and all I could think was: 'Cathy! I know that's Steve over there but this is not 'Traffic'! Get yourself a cocktail before the next take and get with the program!'",Null,1,2,12 December 2004
Elf," The first truly great Christmas film since 'A Christmas Story'
","Of course, 'A Christmas Story' is in a class by itself, as it's one of the best films ever made about growing up in America - not just a holiday flick. 'Elf' is a more typical Christmas movie, just an unbelievably good one. I pity any other Christmas movies coming out this year; they will suck almost by default after this.The secret, I think, are director Jon Favreau's smart choices. He keeps Will Farrell and James Caan in character 101% of the time - he never allows them to comment on their characters in any way. Both play it absolutely straight and it works like a charm. Favreau also deserves some Golden Genius Award for casting Ed Asner as Santa and Bob Newhart - one of our national treasures - as Farrell's adopted Papa Elf. Both are priceless and will be long remembered for this movie.Favreau's other smart choice is to keep the length of most scenes very short; he gets in, gets the laugh and gets out. It's very easy for this type of movie to become embarrassing or even cruel for the 'special' character at the center. Favreau knows this and never lets a scene drag on long enough for our amusement to turn to pity.As a film in general, 'Elf' isn't important enough to rate more than a 7 or 8, but as a Christmas movie, it's a 10+.",8,0,0,8 November 2003
Lost in Translation," Sad we've raised a generation that can't appreciate this
","Some of the negative comments on this just make my skin crawl. I suppose you people would prefer a cinema world in which all movies are made by the Stevens Spielberg and Soderbergh? I suspect both of those gentlemen will very much admire this film, and perhaps wonder why they can't quite match it.Trust me: this is not the most overrated film of the year. It is, in fact, a lovely, dreamlike parable about the nature of love. Too bad there isn't much call for dreamlike parables these days.",Null,0,0,25 October 2003
Forrest Gump," Vastly overrated, but still a very good movie...but please see 'Being There'
","Way, way too many people think this is the greatest movie ever made. They clearly haven't seen enough movies and their idea of a great book must be something like 'Tuesdays with Morrie.' Americans do tend to be a sentimental lot, fond of oversimplification and easy answers. Still, my China-born wife, daughter of a party member who didn't know ANY of the cultural or historical references when she first saw it, thinks it's the best American movie she's seen. So there is something universal and powerfully emotional here.More than anything else, this is a work of superior craftsmanship that seems to inspire many people to read far too much into it. This is not a profound film, but it is a very well-made, highly entertaining one.So many others have mentioned 'Being There' as the smarter, meaner version of 'Gump' that I'd like to add my voice to that chorus. It is a travesty that 'Being There' is now largely forgotten. If you admire the structure of 'Gump' make sure you get around to renting it. Hell, if you hate 'Gump' get around to renting it.",8,2,5,6 July 2005
The Aviator," Just a very, very good movie
","Because Scorsese is among our most acclaimed and studied directors, his work always causes people to think too much. Just relax - this is a truly good biographical film in a world of terrible biographical films. Anyone who finds it dull is a compulsive channel surfer who's probably just a few steps away from saving their urine in bottles. The picture crackles with energy and doesn't seem anywhere near as long as it is.And you pilots and airplane geeks out there are going to totally bliss out when you see this. The five flying sequences are among the greatest ever conceived...only the most committed and experienced wingnuts among you will be able to detect any seams between the real and the digital airplanes. The aviation content is better than 95% accurate, which probably makes this a definitive airplane film, considering how wretchedly ignorant Hollywood is about anything involving technology. Oh, they've pretty much figured out the broadsword by now, but you can count on them to get anything with moving parts wrong pretty much all the time.",9,0,3,9 January 2005
The Bourne Identity," Wow...this absolutely sucks compared to its own sequel!
","My definition of a cinematic idiot is anyone who found 'The Matrix' confusing. If you are NOT one of those people, I strongly suggest you see 'The Bourne Supremacy' WITHOUT SEEING THIS FIRST. I did and I'm really, really happy about it. 'Identity' is extremely mediocre stuff, whereas the sequel is an instant classic. If you are a sharp moviegoer you'll get all the background information you need from the skillful and very clever use of flashbacks in 'Supremacy.' It has a better story, better acting, better music, better locations and MUCH better action. 'Supremacy' also has a fresh, unique and genuinely thrilling visual style, while this is exactly like a hundred (maybe a thousand) other films and TV shows. 'The Bourne Supremacy' is essential. This movie is completely unnecessary.",4,1,2,19 March 2005
The Italian Job," Start your engines - Summer is here!
","This ain't no 'Ocean's Eleven' because it doesn't have megaton starpower and it relies on murderous violence for a lot of the plot motivation, but I suspect the average moviegoer will like it even more. Very tight, with a terrific mid-flick twist that I didn't see coming. Everyone is at least OK, even Marky Mark, though somebody like Brad Pitt would have been oh so much better. I am devoted to the original 'Italian Job' - hopefully this flick will get a lot more people to check out the original, which is still a fine, wry comedy in the classical British style.",Null,0,0,1 June 2003
Collateral," What are movies for, anyway?
","When I was younger, I had a fairly intellectual approach to the movies. French new wave, the human condition reflected through the auteur, total rejection of virtually all Hollywood films, etc. Now...well, if the two hours goes by without my attention slipping back to whatever dumb problem my life is centered on at the moment, I have to call it a good movie. This is now the bottom line, whether it's something deep or something trivial: if the writer and director can convince my brain to focus on his entirely artificial space/time for the length of the film, he's done me a HUGE favor.By that standard, 'Collateral' is a 10/10 movie.Now...if my younger self were to see this, he'd probably point out a LOT of problems. Some reviewers actually called this 'realistic' - clearly these are people whose concept of 'reality' comes from seeing too many movies. The only 'realism' in this comes from Michael Mann's obsessive interest in firearms; he is the only director I know of that always gets guns and gunplay absolutely dead on perfect, and I say this as someone who taught cops to shoot for a living.But the people and circumstances that lead to all those rounds being expended live in a total movie fantasy world, where logic is absent and lethal pressure turns ordinary guys into heroes, instead of crushing them into dust, as most often happens in the real world. This is pure escapism, stylish and gritty but in no way connected to anything that might actually happen anywhere at any time.But really - isn't that the whole point?",8,0,0,26 January 2005
The Transporter," At least it's short!
","My wife like to watch movies a lot more than I do...this was on PPV, so we gave it a shot. This is a PERFECT example of a $1.98 script and a $35M budget. Everyone tries as hard as they can, but it's just as stupid as you can possibly imagine. That doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. Just check your mind at the door, so to speak. The best thing about it (which surprised me) was the lack of a phony ending before the real one. I can't stand that, and it's become the action movie standard, unfortunately. Overall, this is less a waste of time than 'The Matrix Reloaded,' which is like having a root canal compared to something as light and pointless as this.",Null,0,0,31 May 2003
X-Men: The Last Stand," Lame, as expected without Singer...or an idea for a story
","After reading so many reviews of this obviously written by kids who just haven't had time to develop any real critical faculties yet, I feel very sad. So much enthusiasm for this disorganized mess depresses me, because it means the Brett Ratners of the cinema world are winning the war. It's criminal that this talentless hack was allowed to destroy what was a pretty elegant series of films.Listen, adults: this movie isn't competent to lick the boots of either of the previous X-Men films. There is more of everything you go to movies for in the first five minutes of X2 that in the entirety of this inept pile of missed opportunities.That said, this is not the worst movie I've seen this year, but it's certainly the most disappointing. There is so little substance to the script that even Sir Ian, probably the finest, most mesmerizing actor alive today - a man who can damn near stop time with a single glance - can't hold his character together. Imagine what a pickle the lesser mortals are in here.Considering the remarkable quality of the first two X-Men films, this big, loud Bruckheimer-esq movie is a crying shame, but hardly an unexpected one. One hopes Bryan Singer's new Superman film is good enough that we will be compelled to forgive him for abandoning what was looking like the best series of the current comic book/superhero era.I started glancing at my watch after only 15 minutes. Don't bother with this.",2,2,3,29 May 2006
La La Land," Something new, not really comparable to the classic American musicals
","Aside from being one of the most genuinely enjoyable movies I've seen in years, La La Land is a very interesting film without any direct peers (although I suppose, in a way, it is 'Whiplash After Anger Management'; it will be interesting to see if Damien Chazelle has another story in him). As others have pointed out, it's more like Jacques Demy's musicals than anything else, but it's really not much like those either and nobody under around 50 (aside from dedicated musical freaks and faithful attendees at repertory movie houses) has seen Demy anyway. You can't compare La La Land to any previous American musical romance, not directly (the few people I've talked to who say they didn't enjoy the film insist on doing exactly that). What Chazelle has done is tweak just about every element of the classic formula for the modern audience, then integrate those elements into a very modern, very emotional storytelling form. In doing this, he's actually created something entirely new. It doesn't matter at all that his leads aren't particularly great singers or dancers and it doesn't matter at all that the score is a little thin; it's the total package that has made this movie such a stunning success with audiences. It's modern cinematic alchemy which draws on the past glories of the American musical without actually copying them. As a film it completely avoids nostalgia, even as its lead characters drown in it at times. That's quite a trick to pull off, just as it's a real achievement to employ magical elements like 'dancing in the stars' with a modern audience and not get laughs where you don't want them. By current standards, virtually all classic American movie musicals are defined by their episodic structure. About a month before I saw La La Land, I saw the TCM revival of Singin' in the Rain, which is probably the consensus choice as the most enjoyable musical of the classic era. It's also one of the very best written, but it's still a collection of outstanding production numbers linked by a plot that is almost incidental. That's perfectly fine and it's what we expect from the classic musicals; it's part of what makes them so much fun. La La Land is a different kind of fun. It's all about its own structure; it has a story-driven flow to it and is far more dependent on strong acting than the old musicals ever were. It's not just a matter of removing mid-century corn from the script; it's built around a very modern form of storytelling that was just starting to emerge around the time musicals went out of fashion. It is much more emotional than it is technical (in its music and dance as much as in its words) and it wouldn't work at all without top-flight acting, something you definitely can't say about even the greatest classic musicals. Since it's unlikely we are on the cusp of a glorious new age of musicals, La La Land will likely stand as a singular achievement: maybe the most emotionally realistic musical ever, while still a total escapist fantasy. I find that very often the best films are the ones that had the least chance of getting made; it's a perfect example of one.",9,3,11,13 March 2017
National Treasure," Disney's Finest Crap for the Kiddies - I hope Harvey picked up a nice check, at least
","Wake up! This is a kid's movie made with an adult budget and at least four A-list actors. On that level it's fine; my 10 year old daughter has seen it twice and loves it, but then she's at an age when something like this seems complex and clever, like Nancy Drew on steroids. Grownups should look elsewhere...but apparently many of them like it just fine here. That just flat out amazes me.Why, why, why so many raves on IMDb for this overlong, incredibly derivative and mind-numbingly mediocre movie? I especially like all the comments by people who say 'I'm not a Nicholas Cage fan but I really liked him in this.' Well, I AM a Nicholas Cage fan and he isn't even trying here (which means he's still better than most living actors). See him in 'Matchstick Men' to get an idea of what he's capable of, circa 2004. Similarly amusing are all the 'Best since Raiders of the Lost Ark' notes. Believe me, this doesn't belong on the same planet with that classic. The Brendan Frasier 'The Mummy' is vastly better than this and great fun for Indy fans, while somehow not ripping him off, at least not egregiously. Too scary for most kiddies, though.Maybe it's just fun to watch top flight actors like Harvey K. and Jon V. go slumming like this. Maybe that's it. But I was ready for some fresh air after the first 40 minutes - and there were another 91 to go. Yawn.Oh yeah: Diane Kruger is very, very pretty and can act to boot. Generally I tend to side with Marianne Faithful, one of the world's famous blonds herself, who once said that 'All blonds are the same.' Diane is a powerful exception; it would be nice to see her in something worth my time. If not my car.",3,2,4,8 May 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Wait for the DVD
","OK...so eventually you've got to see this, if only for the catty scenes with Monica Bellucci and Lambert Wilson. But it's got to be one of the biggest disappointments in years, right up there with The Phantom Menace.  I send out about one movie recommendation a year to a large group of friends (the last was to recommend 'Punch Drunk Love'); this is the first time I've been moved to actually warn people. This is only too fitting because the first film gave us all so much hope that maybe these Wachowskis (who made Bound, for god's sake) were something really new and different for big-time Hollywood: relatively young people who could take ideas derived from absolutely everything they saw while growing up and yet turn them into something unique and utterly cool. Which they did. Once.It's really painful to watch a story so promising turn into bad Star Trek. It kills me how apologistic critics keep referring to the 'humanity' of the film - trust me, any humanity it contains comes from a particularly bad episode of Deep Space Nine. Even the action sequences go on way too long and what's worse, do not contribute much of anything to the narrative. They are there because it's what everyone expects, not because they make any sense or have any relevance. I defy anyone to explain why the celebrated battle against 100 Agent Smiths is about: they can't kill him, he can't kill them, so it just ends. Huh? You can get that kind of brilliance in Tom & Jerry cartoons.$175 million in people and tech can't make up for a $1.98 script. Rent as cheaply as possible.",Null,0,0,19 May 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Bad. Really, really bad.
","The producers of this are the luckiest people in Hollywood at the moment. Thanks to the celebrity-snogging factor, they've been saved from the box office drubbing they so richly deserved. How sad. People really are sheep.The first hour is (barely) passable; the second is just dreary. Things explode and lots and lots of people are killed; this is just as much a video game as either of Jolie's awful Lara Croft pictures. The extended action sequence in which the married cold-blooded killers (oh...they are 'professionals,' so we're not supposed to notice that they are the scum of the earth) destroy their house while trying to kill each other and then play violent make-up games is utterly predictable and utterly revolting. This movie has the moral core of a New York pimp. It also has no ending, but you can say that about 2 out of 3 Hollywood movies these days.If this were truly played for laughs it might have been a kick, like the original version of 'The In-Laws' with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin. But it's not funny, not by a long shot. I guess the one consolation is that, based on appearances at least, Pitt and Jolie will probably use some of their take from this pile to do something good out in the real world.Somebody give Doug Liman a script, please. I think he may aspire to being a movie director, not just a wholesale consumer of firearms and ammunition.",2,9,17,10 July 2005
Hitch," Another really fun movie wrecked by a rotten third act
","Why? Why can't Hollywood scriptwriters come up with good endings? What IS the problem? On the way out of this, my wife asked me how I thought it compared to 'Runaway Bride.' I almost burst out laughing, because both movies have EXACTLY the same problem: a pretty good or great first hour, followed by a whole string of false, cheap-jack scenes building to a highly predictable ending.Go see this. See if you don't have a great time right up to the moment Eva Mendez visits Will Smith's apartment. See how the whole movie just falls apart from that moment on.I'm so tired of this.",Null,1,2,13 February 2005
The Deer Hunter," It was 1978 and everyone in the audience was about to wet their pants
","No, this is not the best film about the Vietnam War; it's hardly about Vietnam at all. The vets who don't like it have it wrong, as do the Vietnamese who found it racist. It could be any war, with any combatants. But because the (primary) victims here are recognizable American archetypes, Americans will feel this in their gut more than any other war film I know of. This is one of the very few post-war Hollywood films that shows a sincere reverence for the lives of small town Americans.After seeing it in a very high quality theater on its initial release, I walked out thinking it was easily one of the best movies I had ever seen - and that I never wanted to see it again. But I looked at it today on cable and found that not much had changed about it, or me. I don't want to see it again...but I want you to see it.Even now, the Russian Roulette scene (in context, people: watch all that comes before it first) is the single most intense sequence I've seen; it makes the end of 'Reservoir Dogs' seem like a cartoon. Best Walken performance, period. Meryl Streep glows, DeNiro has seldom been more affecting. A unique classic...it is not surprising that Cimino didn't have another movie in him after something this wrenching.",10,334,433,6 April 2006
Heat," Enthralling...and extremely overrated
","OK...I like this movie. I like Michael Mann in general. But the idea that 'Heat' is some kind of definitive crime movie is pretty silly.It does get lots of points for being a very long movie that never really drags at all. But it would still have been much better with a half-hour (or more) cut out of it. The film school touches intended to produce an 'epic' nearly all misfire; the VERY strong supporting cast somehow keeps several of them from turning into major LOL moments.The performances of the leads are wildly overrated by IMDb members. Pacino mugs his way through this, as he does most of his films since 'Scarface.' DeNiro is much better but nowhere near the top of his game. People always praise Val Kilmer for 'keeping up' with these icon guys, but the reality is they aren't running all that hard to begin with. That said, Kilmer is good here, as is the entire supporting cast.Crime movies don't have to be realistic to be great (see 'Sin City') but it's incredible how many people think Michael Mann makes 'realistic' action films. Yeah, he's obsessed with technical details and gets them right more often than most directors. But there's just about nothing realistic about 'Heat' or 'Collateral'; they both exist in a make-believe LA populated by make-believe good guys and bad guys. Frankly, if you think Mann's crime films are true-to-life, then everything you know comes from movies and TV and headline news.Don't get me wrong here; I highly recommend you see 'Heat' and 'Collateral' - they are both extremely well-made and pretty damn riveting. But if seeing either one is some kind of life high point for you, I'd respectfully suggest you need to get a new life.",7,1,6,28 July 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Exceptional - the best we'll get unless somebody picks up Adam Hall's 'Quiller' novels
","Most spy/action movies suck hard - this is probably the best one since 'Marathon Man.' Super sharp, super smart with absolutely breathless action, THE best car chase of all time and a pitch-perfect supporting cast; are there any working actors better than Joan Allen and Brian Cox? I haven't seen 'The Bourne Identity' but I feel as if I have, due to the extremely skillful use of flashbacks in this film. Greengrass' 'put you right in the center of the explosion' approach is perfect for this material. Fabulous score, too. This is absolutely how the spy/action genre film should be done; what are the DePalma apologists who still think 'Mission: Impossible' was a good movie going to do after seeing this? I'm surprised the movie did good business, considering the general collapse of moviegoer intelligence over the past 30 years; you must pay attention or you will be left behind. It's worth expending a few brain cells on something this accomplished.Extracting a movie this good from the labored, uninspired writing of Robert Ludlum is quite a feat. The same team of filmmakers could create a series of superthrillers, each one more intense than the last, by grabbing the 'Quiller' series by the late Adam Hall (who also wrote 'The Flight of the Phoenix' under another name). The Quiller books may be the most heart-pounding espionage novels ever written.",9,12,22,28 February 2005
