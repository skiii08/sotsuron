The Blair Witch Project," 'I never gave Mike any fart allowance.' I'm in two minds over this one.
","The Blair Witch Project starts with the revelation that three student filmmakers disappeared in October 1994 & that the footage they shot has been discovered & is presented here for our viewing pleasure... Two young student filmmakers Heather Donahue & Joshua Leonard pick their friend Mike Williams up & set off for Burkitsville, Maryland to investigate & film a documentary on a local legend known as the 'Blair Witch'. To get their documentary going they interview various residents of Burkitsville who tell the tale of the Blair Witch, with the interview footage in the can the three set off into the nearby woods to carry on their documentary & try to delve a little deeper into the legend. Unfortunately they soon become lost, tensions begin to boil as Heather has the map but doesn't seem able to read it properly & when they try to sleep at night they are awoke & attacked by something from within the woods. Their plight becomes desperate as they run low on food, morale, patience & are continually harassed by someone or something, someone or something evil...Edited, written & directed by Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez The Blair Witch Project was apparently shot in a mere 8 days, was made for about $22,000 & made back $240,500,000 which is a ratio of $10,931 made for every $1 spent which ain't too bad, is it? Persoanlly I like certain aspects of it but dislike others. The script tries to keep it as real as possible with natural dialogue (I'm not sure who counted but apparently The Blair Witch Project contains 133 'F*cks') & most of the film looks improvised which I think it was. Everything is kept to a minimum & nothing is really explained which gives it a genuine creepiness at times, in this case less is more. We know what the characters know, which is pretty much nothing when I think about it. It can drag a bit, has only three character's & it does go round in circles while the lack of any sort of explanation for anything did annoy me & then there is the bizarre ending which will either please or disappoint you. The main area where The Blair Witch Project stands out is the way it is filmed just like a documentary & the film could indeed be made up of scraps of footage haphazardly spliced together as it alternates between colour & black and white & the cinematography has a real amateur hand held jerkiness about it to add to the supposed authenticity & we get lots of pointless (but psychologically important for the whole documentary effect) shots of people's backs, the ground & the sky, the entire film is shot first-person with a hand held camera usually operated by Heather & frankly this approach can become tedious & annoying at times. For those looking for sleek cinematography, cool camera angles & fancy special effects The Blair Witch Project is not for you, for those looking for something a little bit different & original then you could do a lot worse although it's hard to tell what any one person's reaction will be to a film such as this. There is no blood or gore or sex, just lots of bad language so don't expect anything like that. I must admit there is a certain eerie atmosphere & creepiness about The Blair Witch Project especially the scenes where the three students are attacked in the dead of night & are unable to see anything. The acting is pretty good throughout by a young & unknown (at the time) cast. The Blair Witch Project is certainly different although I'm not quite sure why it turned out to be such the huge commercial success that it was, I can still remember when it came out over here it was everywhere & everyone I knew wanted to see it but most were ultimately disappointed when they did. Definitely worth a watch especially for horror fans & considering it probably turns up on TV all the time it shouldn't be too hard to get the opportunity to see it & you should give it a go if you have a spare 85 odd minutes.",6,1,5,1 November 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not as good as Vol. 1...
","Kill Bill: Vol. 2 starts as vengeful assassin Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) head towards El Passo & Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen) to continue her roaring rampage of revenge. Things don't go her way though & she ends up buried alive, can she escape & finally get her long awaited revenge on her ex-boss Bill (David Carradine) who left her & her baby for dead?Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino I'll say it straight away, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is nowhere near as good as Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) in my opinion. There, I said it & I firmly believe it to be the truth. In Kill Bill: Vol. 1 there was a definite energy, a zip, a breakneck pace that lead from one over-the-top set-piece to another. It had buckets of violence & blood while still maintaining that cool Tarantino vibe that was present in both Reservoir Dogs (1992) & Pulp Fiction (1994) which made them both iconic hits of the 90's. Here in Kill Bill: Vol. 2 the pace is sedate, the self consciously cool small talk dialogue just isn't as effective here with noting particularly exciting happening around it. Kill Bill: Vol. 2 just ends up feeling like a hollow mess with lots of irreverent dialogue which tries to be cool, I'm sorry but for me it didn't work & I frankly missed the violence, the gore & the character's of Kill Bill: Vol. 1 which I think I'm going to watch again to get the memory of Kill Bill: Vol. 2 out of my mind. There are still some nice scenes here & some mildly amusing dialogue along the way but as a whole I don't think it has what made Kill Bill: Vol. 1 so special, above average but below the standard I expected & hoped for.Director Tarantino knows how to turn in a stylish action flick, it's just a shame the action doesn't really start until an hour in. Since Tarantino is a bit of a fan-boy when it comes to martial arts & cult flicks in general there are loads of references to other films which you may or may no notice although I thought it was nice that the film mentions Shogun Assassin (1980) by name as the similarities are obvious & for those of you who don't know Shogun Assassin is a real film & it's an absolutely terrific film at that. Rumour has it Tarantino has a thing for feet & you can tell here because there are a lot of scenes involving people's feet including another scene of Thurman stepping on & crushing someones plucked out eyeball, foot fetishists will enjoy this. I didn't think all of the visual tricks worked in this & preferred the comic book feel of the original. The violence here is much tamer than Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Vol 1 had over forty on screen death's while Vol. 2 has a paltry three of which Thurman only kills one, Elle (Daryl Hannah) kills Budd & Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu) with Thurman killing Bill at the end. I know violence & action don't necessarily make a great film they sure as hell help!With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is very well made with top notch production values, it definitely has that expensive Hollywood look to it, excellent cinematography & choreography. The acting is pretty good, Thurman makes for a sexy anti-hero & Carradine is a cool bad guy. Samuel L. Jackson gets about 30 seconds of screen time.Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is a definite disappointment after the excellent violent & bloody excess of Kill Bill: Vol. 1, at over two hours it's too long & is a drawn out way to round the story off. Did this really get a 5 minute standing ovation from the audience it was premiered too? If it did why? If you have seen both Kill Bill films & want to watch one again watch the original.",6,1,4,2 July 2007
Alien 3," 'I think it's fair to say that our smoothly running facility has suddenly developed a few problems.' Good, but not as good as the first two...
","Alien 3 starts on the 'US Sulaco' as an electrical fire enables an automated cryo unit jettison procedure & Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Hicks (Michael Biehn who apparently was paid more for the use of his image in Alien 3 than he did for his entire role in Aliens (1986), nice work if you can get it), the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) & Newt (Danielle Edmond) spiral towards 'Fiorina 'Fury' 161 Outer-Veil Mineral Ore Refinery Double Y Chromosome-Work Correctional Facility', basically an old lead works turned prison planet for hardened criminals. Upon crash landing Hicks & Newt are killed & Bishop is damaged beyond repair but Ripley survives & is rescued by the convicts who now inhabit Fiorina, as they help Ripley a dog belonging to one of the prisoners sees something crawling in the shadows... Ripley is taken to the prisons Doctor, Clemens (Charles Dance) where she is given the OK but straight away Ripley's thoughts turn to the alien & whether once again it has followed her. The dog is now in pain & convulsing as eventually an alien bursts out of it's stomach & when it kills an inmate named Murphy (Christopher Fairbank) Ripley tries to convince Warden Andrews (Brian Glover) that the ultimate alien killing machine is loose somewhere in the complex...Directed by David Fincher who has disowned the film due to constant studio interference I thought Alien 3 was a fine film, considering it had a hell of a lot to live up to in it's illustrious predecessors Alien (1979) & Aliens it didn't turn out so bad. Alien 3 was also plagued by production problems, a spiralling budget (I bet Fox liked that), $7 million in built sets for a script that was never used, various directors dropping out or being fired & filming being halted by Fox because of the troubles so it's a surprise that it ended up as good as it did. The script by David Giler, Walter Hill & Larry Ferguson is a little slow & virtually relegates the alien to a bit part as Weaver's Ripley takes centre stage. Ripley's character is explored more here than the previous two films, in fact Alien 3 revolves around her more than the alien which pops up occasionally to kill a prisoner until the final 20 or so minutes when it actually has some significance to the on screen action. I thought the ending rounded things off nicely, that was until Alien: Resurrection (1997) was made anyway. I also thought that Alien 3 tries to blend some of the best elements from the first two, the dark haunted house in space feel of the original & the action & chases of the second. Technically I think Alien 3 is marvellous, I love the way Fincher films shots with an almost candlelit pale yellow hue throughout, lots of great angles, cool shots & well composed framing of images. The production design is also fantastic with a realistic looking gritty lead works setting, while the first two Alien films are futuristic in look Alien 3 has the feel of being set in a Victorian factory with it's pipes dripping water, brickwork walls, darkly lit corridors, industrial machinery & chains all over the place, the sets have a huge amount of detail & a lot of time, effort & work obviously went into the look & feel of Alien 3. Unfortunately the alien itself doesn't get much screen time & while the puppet effects are good with plenty of slime the CGI effects look pretty poor these days. There is some violence here but not too much, mostly blood splats on walls although there is a quick shot when the alien bites into someones head. The acting is good from all involved with Yorkshire man Glover being quite likable. It must have been tough making a sequel to two of the greatest Sc-Fi horror films ever made but everything considered I think Alien 3 doesn't embarrass itself at all. Despite being a bit slow in places & making the alien seem like an afterthought on occasion I found an entertaining & watchable film which I enjoyed. Definitely worth a watch for both Sci-Fi & horror fans.",7,8,13,16 August 2005
Gremlins," 'I rarely use it myself sir, it promotes rust.' Entertaining family orientated fantasy horror.
","Gremlins starts with an inventor named Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) being lead into a shop by a young Chinese boy (John Louie) & introduces Randall to his Grandfather (Keye Luke). Randall is looking for a Christmas present for his son Billy (Zach Galligan) & finds a cage in the corner of the shop with a cute little creature inside called a Mogwai & buys it, however there are three rules which must never be broken, don't get him wet, expose him to sunlight & most importantly never feed him after midnight. Back home in the small American town of Kingston Falls & Randall gives Billy the Mogwai who he calls Gizmo, unfortunately one of Billy's friends Pete (Cory Feldman) spills water on Gizmo which make him reproduce as little Mogwai's pop out of his back. These ones are different to Gizmo, they are mischievous & trick Billy into feeding them after midnight. The next morning & Billy's room is full of slimy green cocoons which eventually hatch & let loose green scaly monsters with big ears & sharp teeth. It's not long before one of them has jumped into the local swimming pool for reproduction purposes & before anyone knows it the entire town is overrun with Gremlins intent on death & destruction. It's up to Billy & his girlfriend Kate (Phoebe Cates) to try & save the day as the local authorities have a hard time believing their story...Directed by Joe Dante Gremlins is a big budget family orientated horror fantasy film with a strong comedy element & for what it is it isn't too bad at all. The script by Chris Columbus takes a little while to get going as there isn't a green slimy Gremlin until past the 45 minute mark which is a bit long really. When they do show up most of what they get up to is of moral questionalbility with beer drinking, smoking cigarette's, attacking people, causing crashes & playing poker rather than all out blood & gore, in fact not that many people actually die in Gremlins. In a way I'm not sure quite what Gremlins set out to be, a scary horror film with monsters on the rampage or a more family fantasy type film with the sentimental Father Son stuff, the lovable inventor whose inventions never quite work, the highly intelligent family dog who can seemingly understand English, the way the Mogwai's are so cute & in the end Gremlins is half & half with neither element particularly dominating. The gore & violence is relatively restrained & mostly aimed at the Gremlins themselves with a one being sliced up in a meat mincer, one explodes in a microwave, one is decapitated & it's head lands on a fire & there is a cool melting Gremlin at the end. The character's are likable even if their a little overblown & overly comical. With a budget of about $11,000,000 Gremlins is technically very good with that Hollywood polish to it. The special effects are generally very good although don't forget that Gremlins was made way before the advent of CGI so expect lots of puppets & animatronics rather than flashy computer effects. The cinematography, music & production values are great & it is well made throughout. The acting is OK but nothing spectacular. Gremlins is one of those somewhat predictable 'feel good' films made by big studios & at what it sets out to be Gremlins succeeds & is a very good film in it's own right. The slightly slow first half & it's indecision on what it wants to be stops it from obtaining classic status in my eyes but Gremlins is still a fine film & well worth a watch.",7,0,3,2 November 2005
The Expendables 2," Enjoyable old school action flick.
","The Expendables 2 starts as ace sniper Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) tells his boss Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) that he wants to leave the Expendables, a team of tough mercenaries who are for hire & take on dangerous jobs that need lots of firepower. Ross accepts his decision, however later that night the sinister CIA man Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) orders Ross & his team of expendables to carry out one last job for him, since Church can have them all jailed for life or killed Ross has little alternative but to agree. A plane has crashed with some extremely important cargo locked in a safe on-board, it's up to Ross & the expendables to find, retrieve & deliver the cargo back to him before it falls into the wrong hands. The mission at first seems easy & all goes well but after finding the cargo Ross & the expendables are ambushed by the sadistic Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) & his men who steal the precious cargo & kill Billy the Kid leaving Ross & the rest of the expendables swearing vengeance...Directed by Simon West who I guess was a decent enough choice after turning in enjoyable enough big budget fare like Lare Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) & the excellent Con Air (1997) which still remains one of my personal favourite OTT action films (Nicolas Cage should be in The Expendables 3... while we're at it how about Wesley Snipes & Kurt Russell too) this is a direct sequel to the highly enjoyable old school action film The Expendables (2010) & while I didn't think it was quite as good The Expendables 2 is still a lot of fun & thankfully doesn't abandon it's violent action film roots. The first twenty odd minutes & the last twenty odd minutes are brilliant, action packed, funny & highly entertaining & it's a slight shame that the intervening hour is a little dull & empty. The major problem with The Expendables 2 is the lack of a substantial story, there's very little here & what is here is merely there to hang the action set-pieces off. It's hard to think about the character's as individuals rather than the actor's that play them which is also maybe doesn't help, that's the one great negative though & the killing of Billy the Kid & the revenge mission that ensues takes a backseat to the action, the egos & the one-liners so be prepared for that. The script is nicely nostalgic, it gives the main cast plenty of opportunity to throw in several gags & references to their earlier films & well known one-liners in an amusing & playful way but never in a derogatory mocking sense. At about 100 minutes long The Expendables 2 doesn't outstay it's welcome & your never far from the fight, shoot-out, one-liner or explosion.The likes of Bruce Willis & Arnold Schwarzenegger get much bigger roles this time around although Jet Li is only there for the opening fifteen minutes, I suppose we should be grateful a compromise was struck & he came back at all as he has said he wants to quit Hollywood. New action film star additions to the cast include the legendary Chuck Norris who seems very game to live up to his reputation (the Cobra gag is hilarious) while Jean-Claude Van Damme is still in very good shape unlike a few of the other's as age catches up with them but to be fair the fact they are all in such good shape at their age says a lot. Jason Statham is great values as always, his sole fight scene in a Chapel is fantastic as are all the action scenes, West manages to bring scale & excitement to things while never confusing matters with shaky hand-held camcorder crap & quick editing. This is the way action scenes should be shot, loud, violent & great fun, the hilarious scene with Schwarzenegger & Willis in the little car is worth watching the film for on it's own. 80's & 90's action fans starved of that type of film over recent years should definitely get a kick out of it.With a supposed budget of about $100,000,000 The Expendables 2 has great action scenes & plenty of star power, during the 80's & 90's who would have thought all the top action film stars of the day would team up? Filmed in China & the US but mainly in Bulgaria. I liked the performances here, everyone seems to be having fun although I wasn't impressed with new female team member Nan Yu who has little to do & gets lost amongst the egos.The Expendables 2 is a great old school action film, full of violence, gun fights, explosions & senseless death & destruction. What more do you want? Apart from a story that is. 80's & 90's action fans should lap it up, I did. Apparently The Expendables 3 is already in production.",6,2,2,10 November 2012
The Ring," 'Hey! My horse!' Really rather good remake.
","The Ring starts with a teenage girl named Rebecca Kotler (Rachael Bella) telling her friend Katie Embry (Amber Tamblyn) about a cursed videotape that if watched the viewer will get a phone call & die in exactly 7 days, of course it's all just a stupid urban legend until a very worried Kate confesses she has seen the tape & by a complete coincidence exactly 7 day ago & before the night is finished the inevitable happens... Katie's Mother Ruth (Lindsay Frost) ask's reporter & friend of the family Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) to do what she does best & investigate the mysterious circumstance's surrounding her daughter's death from apparent heart failure, Rachel agrees & soon learns of the videotape story. She retraces Katie's steps back to a motel & finds the tape which she watches & receives the phone call, as she investigates the tape & the image's on it Katie believes the story to be true & that she has a few days left before she dies unless she can figure out a way to put an end to the curse...This American Japanese co-production was directed by Gore Verbinski & is a fine remake of the original popular Japanese horror film Ringu (1998). The script by Ehren Kruger based on the Ringu novel by Koji Suzuki I think actually improves upon the Japanese original which I have seen & liked but I liked this one more, the films start off fairly similar with the news reporter becoming involved & watching the tape herself but about half way through The Ring '02 actually tries to put a proper story to the tape & at this point it goes in it's own direction & sets about telling a decent little ghost story which in the end is quite effective. The film moves along at a good pace although not much actually happens in it so don't expect lots of gore or action as The Ring is that type of horror film which actually tries to rely on a good strong story as opposed to in-your-face special effects & loud music. The character's are good as is the dialogue, there are some genuinely creepy moments & the basic concept of watching a videotape that will kill you in 7 days is quite sinister & freaky. Everything unfolds in a satisfying fashion although not everything works perfectly, for example the ending almost seemed like the filmmakers didn't know where to go with the story & they just wanted to finish the film. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by The Ring '02 as I wasn't expecting a lot but I found myself really enjoying it & it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Verbinski makes this film what it is, the film has a terrific atmosphere of bleakness & gloom. He shoots everything in a grayish dull tone that gives the film an air of depression & hopelessness & it works extremely well. The cinematography is kept simple yet it is highly effective I mean I'd never have thought a single tree could have been so effective & striking, thankfully there's no annoying quick fire edits here. There are some great scenes in The Ring & some pretty creepy ones too especially the sight of a ghostly girl emerging from a TV set, forget about any violence or gore as it's not that type of film.With a supposed budget of about $45,000,000 The Ring has that Hollywood polish about it & has excellent production values as one would expect. Apparently a fair amount of footage was cut from the final version including a sub-plot about a child killer & Samara's death was far more explicit, it would be nice to see this stuff but I doubt there will ever be a director's cut. Turned down by Jennifer Connelly, Gwyneth Paltrow & Kate Beckinsale before Watts accepted she does a good job as the lead who desperately searches for answers & the rest of the largely unknown cast does well.The Ring is a remake which betters the original as quite a few do including The Blob (1988), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2004) that's controversial I know but it's just my opinion & The Hills Have Eyes (2006) so all this remake fever in Hollywood has actually produced it's fair share of good films & I definitely count The Ring as one of them, well worth a watch especially if you like ghost stories.",7,4,7,30 January 2007
Minority Report," Good sci-fi action thriller.
","Minority Report is set in 2054 nine years after the PreCrime program was implemented in Washington D.C., a pilot program in which mutant psychics known as PreCogs foresee murders & PreCrime officers arrest the future murderer on grounds of intent. There hasn't been a murder in Washington state for over six years & the program has a 100% success record. Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) runs the PreCrime unit but is shocked when the PreCogs predict he will kill a man named Leon Crow in less than a day, a man Anderton has never even met. The PreCogs have never been wrong so Anderton goes on the run in an attempt to discover who set him up, why, how & change his future...Directed by Steven Spielberg & based on a short story by sci-fi author Philip K. Dick this dark & gritty big budget sci-fi action film can be considered amongst Spielberg's best, definitely not Spielberg's very best but not too far off it. The script by Jon Cohen & Scott Frank isn't typical Spielberg, there is a real edge to it with the leading hero a drug addict, a subplot involving child abduction & a vision of the not too distant future where murder can be predicted & those deemed responsible are put away for life without actually doing anything. The film makes the point that the future isn't set, that we choose our own destiny's & there's a strong anti technology message too. The film warns that technology is only as good & as reliable as those operating &/or controlling it, that there will always be human error or those who use the technology for their own advantage & that everything has at least one flaw. Minority Report is an intelligent sci-fi film with plenty of thoughtful themes, concepts, ideas & interesting parallels to the way our own society is going. The character's are good although Colin Farrell's FBI agent is almost totally wasted in a minor role. The mystery elements are good, the twists work well & make sense & there's a clever ending in which it is revealed how someone can commit a murder with the PreCrime system about. The future world in Minority Report seems very plausible, the story & plot are very good & the script has intelligence but if I was to criticise the film I would say that at well over two hours in length it's just too long.The film looks wonderful throughout & the picture it paints of a future world is pretty convincing, from the constant bombardment of adverts which specifically target an individual to eye transplants to the way computers, cars & furniture looks. I would say a lot of time, effort & money was spent on the look of Minority Report & it show's, unfortunately while the sets, futuristic production design & props are superb Spielberg films everything in very muted sterile bland colours, everything has a pale blue, grey, white or black tone to it & I must admit it started to get on my nerves after a while. As I have already said Minority Report has a strong story but Spielberg also gives the audience some spectacular set-pieces including Anderton jumping from speeding car to speeding car, an exciting fight on a car assembly production line, a chase involving Anderton & some flying PreCrime cops to the visually stylish scene set in an apartment building where tiny mechanical spider go from room to room scanning the occupants eyes where Spielberg places his camera above the rooms & in one continuous shot pans across them looking down. The violence is fairly low, there are some fights & shoot-outs plus a couple of surgically removed eyeballs in a plastic bag.With a budget exceeding $100,000,000 Minority Report looks fabulous as one would hope & expect, Spielberg know's how to turn in a great film & it show's here in an almost perfectly judged sci-fi action thriller that actually makes you think. The CGI computer effects are superb & some of the best out there, they actually add to the story as well as the look & the feel of the film. The acting is good, Cruise puts in a good performance (although I am not sure he was worth his reported $25,000,000+ salary) as does veteran actor Max von Sydow.Minority Report is an excellent sci-fi thriller with plenty of spectacular action & a very absorbing & fairly intelligent script, add all that to a little Steven Spielberg magic & you have a great film. My only real problem with it is the length & once you have seen it & know the twists I am not sure how much replay value it has, I doubt I will want to see it again anytime soon.",7,0,1,5 June 2008
Se7en," Brilliantly gripping thriller.
","Se7en starts as rookie homicide detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) is paired up with veteran detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who is set to retire in seven days time. The first case they are called to is that of an obese man who has been forced to eat himself to death, then a lawyer is found dead with the word Greed written in his own blood by his body & upon checking the obese man's apartment the word 'Gluttony' is found written in fat & grease. The connection is made & Somerset believes that a serial killer is at large who has some higher motive & is using the seven deadly sins as a moral reasoning behind his brutal crimes. Somerset is sure that he will strike again & he does, as more mutilated & tortured bodies turn up it emerges that the killer is playing a macabre game that will see him & his crimes remembered forever...Directed by David Fincher this is quite simply a marvellously gripping serial killer thriller that is as good as The Silence of the Lambs (1991) & is considered a classic, as I write this comment Se7en is placed at number 26 in the IMDb's all time top 250 films as voted for by the ordinary person who uses the site (not stuck up critics) & who am I to disagree? The whole production blends together seamlessly to create a truly gripping & absorbing thriller, from the gloomy production design to the terrific acting to the wonderful script & it's character's. It's easy to be drawn into the world of the two leads as they search for a serial killer, Freeman's fantastic performance as Somerset in particular is great to watch, he is thoughtful, precise, likable & smart in an ordinary bloke sort of way while Pitt as Mills is his opposite who is naive & immature. Together they make a perfect contrast of character's & they feel like real people. The script has some great twists & turns but the big one at the end is a real show stopper, it's a great twist ending that just works on so many levels & is brilliantly executed. Se7en has it's seedy, sleazy & gloomy moments but it tries to paint a world where sin is accepted all to freely, there are some great speeches here especially by Somerset that indicate all is not lost but it's easy to see that the real world is full of the sin that is punished here & that we also just accept to readily so it even has a strong relevant social message that does have meaning but at the same time but the script still manages to make a terrific dark thriller out of the ideas here. Lasting for two hours & not being the most action packed film ever patience is definitely needed but I do think the twists & plot do hold ones attention very well, for me the two hours flew by & it didn't feel that long which is always a great sign & one that the film didn't bore me & maintained my interest throughout right until it's killer twist ending.The film looks great with dark & gloomy production design that suits the downbeat seedy world created in the script. There are some gruesome murder scenes & shots of dead bodies although little in the way of actual on screen violence (the killer is never seen killing or hurting anyone on screen for instance), the special effects as expected are top notch (just look at the obese man's corpse on the autopsy table). People make mention of the fact it's always raining in the city scenes but apparently this had nothing to do with thematics or style or the makers vision but because during the first two days of Brad Pitt filming it was raining so to avoid any continuity issues the makers decides to make it rain during all Pitt's outdoor scenes. Apparently the brilliant Canadian director David Cronenberg was offered the chance to direct but he turned it down, imagine how good this might have been if he had accepted? Denzel Washington was offered the part of David Mills that went to Brad Pitt while R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe was considered for the role of the killer.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this was New Line Cinemas first big budget 'A' film & it made a load at the box-office, filmed in Los Angeles in California the name of the city where Se7en takes place is never actually mentioned on screen. The acting is superb all round, Freeman is excellent as is Kevin Spacey & R. Lee Ermey while it was nice to see Shaft himself Richard Roundtree.Se7en is a terrific serial killer thriller that has a great script, a great twist, super acting, good effects, striking production design & a fair bit of depth. There aren't many films I would call classics but maybe Se7en would be one of them.",8,0,5,2 April 2010
Unbreakable," '172,000 comics are sold in the US everyday.' I liked it.
","Unbreakable starts as the Eastrail Train #177 from New York to Philadelphia derails with the loss of 131 lives, the only survivor is security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who has walked away from the crash without a single scratch on him. Shortly after the crash he receives a letter from Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) the owner of an an art gallery specialising in comic books & related artwork, Elijah suffers from a rare disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta which means he has very brittle bones which are easily broken. Elijah tells David that he feels there are people on the opposite side of the scale to him, people with very strong bones & great strength & him walking away from that train crash is proof that he is one of them. Elijah tries to convince David that he is a real life comic book superhero & that his unique powers should be used for good...Written, co-produced & directed by M. Night Shyamalan Unbreakable was his follow up to the huge commercial success that was The Sixth Sense (1999) & both films have much in common, both are set in Philedelphia, both star Bruce Willis who again has a strong involvement with a young boy (no, not in that way...) & both have a genuinely effective & unexpected twist ending. I'll start straight away by saying that I think both The Sixth Sense & Unbreakable are really good films which I like & I find it hard to call one better than the other, if I'm honest I'd probably say The Sixth Sense is slightly better but it's a close run thing. The script which takes itself very seriously has an intriguing & fascinating premise, forget your overblown superhero flicks like Batman (1988), X-Men (2000), Spider-Man (2002) & Fantastic Four (2005) as this is very low key & tries to portray an ordinary man suddenly discovering that he has superhuman powers. Again though it's low key as he can't shoot lasers from his eyes or fly, in fact the whole film is very quiet & very ordinary which was obviously a deliberate thing on the filmmakers part. It's all here with his weakness, his arch enemy & using his powers for good but in a very subtle sort of way that I just liked. The dialogue is very sparse & not much is said, the character's are good & there are lots of little things they do or say that you may not pick up on the first time you watch it but suddenly fall into place as the story progresses. My only real problem is that it's a bit slow & the ending while having a nice twist feels unfinished & rushed.Director Shyamalan does alright although the film is a bit dreary to watch as all the colours are muted, it's as if the film takes place in a world where there isn't a sun & it's overcast all the time. There are no big action scenes or anything like that so don't expect any as the film relies on strong storytelling & an interesting premise. At least Unbreakable is something just that bit different & for that alone it's worth a watch. I wouldn't say it's ever scary like The Sixth Sense but it has a certain atmosphere to it.With a supposed budget of about $75,000,000 one has to ask where all the money went although the reported $20,000,000 Willis was paid accounts for a fair chunk of it. It's well made but not particularly stylish or memorable, I don't know it's just a bit drab looking if I'm honest although I'm sure that was intentional. The acting is pretty good although why does everyone whisper so often? I personally like Willis as an actor & Samuel L. Jackson so I don't have a problem with the cast except for the kid who is annoying but isn't in it enough to totally spoil it. According to the IMDb the usually terrible Julianne Moore was offered the part of Willis' wife & I'm throughly glad she turned it down/didn't get it.Unbreakable is a strange & different sort of fantasy film, it's not for everyone that's for sure but I have to say I really liked it a lot & recommend it. Shyamalan went on to make the alien invasion flick Signs (2002) next with Mel Gibson which I also really liked.",7,2,3,7 August 2007
Underworld," Good but not great, I much prefer the sequel.
","Underworld tells the tale of a race of Werewolves known as the Lychans & a race of Vampires know as, well Vampires & the war that has raged between the two for centuries. The Vampire race has vowed to track down every Werewolf & wipe them out, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is what's know as a deathdealer, one such Vampire who goes around killing Werewolves, it's a living I suppose. However she is suspicious that something big is going down in the Werewolf world, they seem to be after a human named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who happens to have special blood because of someone who he is a descendant of, or something like that. The Werewolf leader Lucien (Michael Sheen) wants Michael's blood to genetically create a Vampire Werewolf cross which will be stronger than either a Vampire or Werewolf for reasons I can't be bothered to go into. It's up to the PVC clad Selene to save the day...This American, German, English & Hungarian co-production was directed by Len Wiseman & I thought it was a decent film although I got the impression that I'd seen it all before & it never quite got me going. I should say at this point that there appears to be two versions of Underworld in distribution, the original theatrical cut & a director's cut & to be honest I don't know which one I saw but it felt way too long either way. The script by Danny McBride is far too drawn out & takes all sorts of ideas & themes from other (much better) films like Blade (1998) & The Matrix (1999) in particular. One big problem I have with Underworld is it's length, at just over 2 hours for the theatrical version & significantly over 2 hours for the director's cut I found myself drifting away & losing interest at various stages as I don't think there's enough going on to sustain one's interest for a couple of hours plus. The basic story is thin to say the least as it mixes the usual traditional Vampire/Werewolf film-lore together with ultra modern up-to-date elements like genetics, hi-tech weaponry & fast cars. It's a fairly good mix to be honest & the film is a good watch but just too long. The plot tries to throw in a couple of twists & turns but I found it all pretty straight forward & a tad predictable. The character's are OK but nothing special & I found the constant comic book type dialogue annoying & repetitive after a while, overall I'd say Underworld is a good film for sure but nothing spectacular.Director Wiseman does a neat job on Underworld although one felt he was more interested on the visual side of it rather than the storyline, he bleaches almost all the colour out of the picture & there were a few moments where it looked liked he shot it in black and white. There's plenty of The Matrix style fights with people performing impossible leaps, lots of people firing cool looking guns in slow-motion & the like, to be honest none of the action scenes are particularly memorable & I found scenes of people firing guns at each other in slow-motion started to become dull well before the end. The film looks great being set within a cool comic book style industrial, Gothic, dark rain soaked world where everyone dresses in fetishistic rubber, PVC, leather & lace. The violence & gore was disappointing, apart from someone having their head sliced in half & some blood splatter there is actually very little of the red stuff present.With a modest sounding $22,000,000 budget Underworld looks more expensive than that, it's a stylish & well made film for sure but again it's nothing we haven't seen before. The special effects are pretty good, both physical & CGI. A special mention for Mrs Beckinsale who looks really hot in her PVC outfit, to be honest I reckon she's worth the price of admission on her own as she kicks & shoots her way through the film, hey I'm easily pleased...Underworld is a good film & one well worth watching if only for Beckinsale in PVC, however I felt it was too long, when you pick the bones from it there's not really much to it & it should have been more violent. Followed by the even better & totally brilliant Underworld: Evolution (2006) which I much prefer to this & the IMDb lists Untitled Underworld Prequel (2009) which I presume hasn't even started shooting yet.",6,0,3,26 November 2006
Kickboxer," Average, somewhat dull early Van Damme flick.
","Kickboxer starts as Eric 'The Eliminator' Sloane (Dennis Alexio) is crowned the World kick-boxing champion, he decides he needs a new challenge & sets of for Thailand where kick-boxing is very popular. Eric & his brother Kurt (Jean-Claude Van Damme) head for Bangkok where he intends to prove himself to be the best by fighting hard as nails 'Tiger' Tong Po (Michel Qissi), Eric gets his wish but soon realises they play dirty in Thailand & Tong beats the crap out of him & just to rub salt into the wound breaks Eric's back which leaves him permanently paralysed & wheelchair bound. Eric's brother Kurt isn't happy about the situation & convinces an old Muay expert Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) to teach him the art of kick-boxing so he can gain revenge on Tong for his brother...Kickboxer is one of those rare films which is credited has having three director's, producer Mark DiSalle (who also is listed in the credits as playing a 'U.S. Reporter') & David Worth with a very young looking JCVD credited as 'fight scenes director' as well, I personally have never seen a film where three separate director's are credited during the opening credits, never. It's then perhaps a surprise that Kickboxer turned out as coherent as it did, I'm not saying it's a great film because it's far from a great film & it isn't even particularly good by JCVD standards but it ain't too bad & passes the time harmlessly enough. The by-the-numbers script by Glen Bruce is just so clichéd & predictable, a man sets out to avenge a family member/friend who has had some sort of injustice inflicted upon them & in that respect Kickboxer is nothing new. Also it's far too predictable, I mean is there really anyone out there who doesn't think that JCVD will defeat Tong Po & avenge his brother? I didn't think so. So what Kickboxer is all about are the fight scenes of which there are not enough, JCVD only fights on four occasions although I admit they are pretty good sequences. The rest of the time is mostly spent watching him get trained by some crazy old Chinese dude in scenes that reminded me of similar ones in The Karate Kid (1984)! It moves along at a reasonable pace & it passes the time but the character's are thin, it's predictable & it's nothing new.Director's DiSalle & Worth do OK with the talky bits while I have to admit JCVD does really well with the fight scenes, the choreography is actually rather impressive with brutal looking fights & kick-boxing scenes. The punches & kicks seem to have impact thanks to them being well staged & clever camera placement & I suppose JCVD's knowledge of martial arts & film-making comes in handy in this respect. Some of the Thai scenery looks quite nice & the early montage of Thai prostitutes & sex shops sets the tone for this lads flick. The violence isn't too strong, it's not overly sadistic or graphic. I was disappointed they didn't make use of the ropes wrapped around their hands with shards of broken glass stuck to them in a scene that is openly parodied in Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), I mean one punch from those & it would have ripped your opponents skin to shreds.With a modest sounding budget of about $1,500,000 Kickboxer looks alright, the locations look nice enough I suppose & it's competently made. Apparently JCVD got paid $70,000 for this, it certainly wasn't for his acting ability though.Kickboxer is an OK time waster if you like martial arts type films or are a huge JCVD fan, if any still exist. I didn't think it was one of his best but nowhere near his worst, it's just very average predictable middle of the road stuff. Successful enough to spawn four sequels none of which featured JCVD, Kickboxer 2: The Road Back (1991), Kickboxer 3: The Art of War (1992), Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor (1994) & Kickboxer 5 (1995) although they seem to have stopped making them now.",5,2,4,10 October 2007
Dawn of the Dead," In my opinion not as good as the '78 original, nowhere near.
","Dawn of the Dead starts just like any other ordinary day for nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) as she goes home after another long shift, she & her husband Luis (Justin Louis) go to bed & have a good nights sleep. The next morning Luis is woken by Vivian (Hannah Lochner), their next door neighbours young girl, who proceeds to bite Luis on the neck. Ana manages to push Vivian out of the room & locks the door, Luis dies in front of her but suddenly comes back to life & attacks Ana in the same frenzied way Vivian attacked him. Ana climbs out of the bathroom window & sees complete pandemonium outside as the dead are returning to life & attacking the living, Ana gets into her car & speeds off but ends up crashing. She is found by a cop named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) who in turn find a guy named Michael (Jake Weber) along with Andre (Mekhi Phifer) & his pregnant wife Luda (Inna Korobkina) who all decide to head to the local shopping mall to find safety. They break in & watch in horror as the streets outside become overrun by flesh eating zombies while the TV news broadcasts offer little hope, if any...Directed by first timer Zack Snyder Dawn of the Dead was apparently described as a 'reimagining' of George A. Romero's utterly brilliant Dawn of the Dead (1978) which itself was a sequel to his groundbreaking Night of the Living Dead (1968) which already has already been remade so I guess Dawn of the Dead was next in line & I personally think the result is less than inspiring. There are two versions available, the theatrical cut & a longer director's cut, unfortunately I watched the shorter theatrical version because that's the one they showed on TV even though I have the director's cut on DVD but just hadn't got round to watching it before it aired on TV, I wish I had because I don't really feel like watching it again despite the promise of some extra gore but I suppose that's irrelevant... The script by James Gunn is actually quite different from the original except the title & the fact that some of it is set in a shopping mall, I think that almost everything that made the '78 original so brilliant is lost or diluted here. The start of the film is completely different & in my opinion the best part of this 'reimagining' as it's rather effective & well built up, once the film gets to the mall not that much actually happens to be honest as straight away it's empty with only two zombies inside, there's no running around shooting zombies, there's no hiding out, there's no locking or blocking the doors off, there's no raid by the bikers & it all seems rather stale, static & predictable. Then there's the character's, there's just too many of them & there's no real connection between them unlike the original which had a tight group of four close friends this time around they are a bunch of unlikeable underdeveloped clichés like the self serving yuppie, the 'strong' female, the big cop, the middle class hero & the antagonistic redneck. I was also disappointed with the lack of social satire, unlike Romero's original which had meaning this is a shallow film where the mall is used as a place to hide & nothing more. When Dawn of the Dead '04 does do something different like the zombie baby or the fact the zombies actually run it goes nowhere & they seem like afterthoughts just for the hell of it. Having said that Dawn of the Dead '04 is far from a bad film, it moves along at nice pace, it has some decent if unspectacular set-pieces & action scenes, I must admit I really liked the ending with the video taped footage during the closing credits, it's very sleek & it certainly passes 100 odd minutes entertainingly enough but it had an almost impossible task to better the original which it most definitely doesn't in any way.Director Snyder does OK & there's plenty of homages to the original including cameo's from Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger & the ever watchable Tom Savini along with the BP trucks from the original turning up as does the WGON traffic helicopter also from the original. Gore wise I thought Dawn of the Dead '04 was very disappointing, there's no big gore scenes unlike the original, there's nothing in here to rival the screwdriver in the ear or the zombie having the top of his head sliced off by helicopter blades or zombies having machetes shoved into their faces or the gruesome cannibalistic scenes at the end. All this new version has to offer are better looking zombies, some gunshot wounds to the head, a spike through a zombies head, a poker through a zombies eye & after that I'm actually struggling, there's nothing here that memorable that will have people talking unlike Dawn of the Dead '78.With a supposed budget of about $28,000,000 Dawn of the Dead '04 obviously is better made than the original with that big budget Hollywood polish about it, it's well made & has good special effects. Apparently the budget for Dawn of the Dead '04 was 'significantly slashed' by Universal after the critical & commercial failure of House of the Dead (2003). The acting is forgettable, I must admit I disliked most of the character's in this.Dawn of the Dead is a perfectly watchable & entertaining horror film that is certainly worth a watch but I think it pales into insignificance when compared to Dawn of the Dead '78, it seems to have a good reputation but it just didn't for much for me. However if you like shallow story lines, poor character's & no stand out set-pieces then you too might like it. Good but not brilliant & overall pretty disappointing.",6,29,50,29 January 2007
Alien: Resurrection," 'Attention... non human presence detected.' I liked it.
","Alien: Resurrection starts by informing us, the viewer that is, we are on a huge spaceship the 'USM Auriga Medical Research Vessel United Systems Military' where on-board there are 'Standing Crew: 42 Enlisted, 7 Science Officers'. The sinister & misguided Dr. Mason Wren (J.E. Freeman) & his team have recreated Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) by cloning her using blood samples, some 200 plus years after she originally died. They want the unborn queen alien inside of her & surgically remove it. Wren has military backing & General Perez (Dan Hedaya) pulls the strings & gets him what he wants. Enter 'The Betty Commercial Freighter Standing Crew: 6 Unregistered', it's crew of criminals & general scum have a delivery for Perez. A delivery of bodies in suspended animation which Wren uses to create more aliens. As you could probably guess it's not long before the aliens have escaped their rather inadequate cages & are rampaging all over the place killing everyone in sight. Ripley, aided by the alien DNA inside her, must once again do battle with the alien & prevent them from reaching planet Earth...Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet I liked Alien: Resurrection, I would probably rate it as third in a very good series of horror Sci-Fi films behind Alien (1979) & Aliens (1986) but ahead of Alien 3 (1992). The script by Joss Whedon isn't a massive departure from the previous instalments, a group of people trapped in an isolated location in a race against time to survive &, of course, plenty of dark corridors. Alien: Resurrection tries to take the best elements from the first two, the spaceship setting from the original & the action from the second, & it does a pretty good job at entertaining for an hour and fifty odd minutes. The strong paternal themes are here again & run throughout the film, the character's are a bit clichéd like the obligatory tough guy, the token black character, the young female & the disposable character's who get no screen time at all except for when they are killed but Ripley is very different this time around which makes for an interesting new angle if nothing else. It moves along a nice pace & is never boring or uneventful. I must admit though I didn't like where Alien: Resurrection went with that stupid looking alien human hybrid at the end.French director Pierre Jeunet (who apparently spoke very little English & had a translator on set at all times) lights the majority of the film in dark browns & oranges which gives it a slightly drab & dull look. He films the action scenes quite stylishly with some nice shots although that ricocheting bullet is the height of stupidity, I would like to see anybody actually try it! Overall the film has a nice style to it & is pleasing on the eyes. Thankfully he doesn't forget about the gore & Alien: Resurrection has to the goriest entry in the series, people have the tops of their heads bitten off, heads squashed, someone is frozen & breaks apart, aliens stick their tongues into & through people, a room full of dead bodies with their chests burst open & a cool bit where an alien burrows through someones head & pops out of their forehead plus there is a room full of gross genetic experiments gone (very) wrong.With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 Alien: Resurrection is undoubtedly a fine looking film with that big budget Hollywood polish to it. Slick cinematography good production values & sets while the aliens themselves have never looked better, apart from one or two poor, by todays standards anyway, CGI shots. I love all that thick slime the aliens drool as well, of which there is plenty. Unfortunately I think the alien hybrid thing at the end looks absolutely awful & like someone wearing a rubber skull mask brought from a joke shop. The acting is OK but they aren't given much to work with.Personally I think Alien: Resurrection is a pretty good action/Sci-Fi/horror film that delivers on all counts, although it's nothing we haven't seen before. Still, definitely worth a watch.",7,3,8,17 December 2005
Shaun of the Dead," A good horror/comedy but somewhat overrated.
","Shaun of the Dead is set in London where Shaun (co-writer Simon Pegg) has problems, his fat mate Ed (Nick Frost) is holding him back, his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumps him & then there's the small matter of hordes of flesh eating zombies that risen from the dead to feast on the living. However, Shaun has a plan to save himself, his mate, his ex-girlfriend & his mum & step-dad which involves barricading themselves into his local pub...This British French co-production was co-written & directed by Edgar Wright & I have to say I was left a little disappointed by it & I can't quite see where all the glowing praise for it comes from. The script by star Pegg & Wright is obviously a nice homage to George A. Romero's 'Dead' films although to be honest I'd sooner watch Romero's splatter/gore films than this odd mixture of comedy, romance & horror. Shaun of the Dead is all very British & maybe the novelty of it wins people over especially those who don't live here in Britian, unfortunately I do live here & it just doesn't have quite the same affect on me. Apparently both Pegg & Wright were involved in the British comedy series 'Spaced' which to be honest I've never heard of & maybe that's where a lot of it's fans come from. Anyway, it's a moderately successful film & certainly a watchable one, it's amusing, it's pretty clever & well written, it has plenty of fun references to other films, it's a fairly fun film but I found it to be too spoofy, it goes to far into the direction of silliness & some of the things that happen just annoyed me. I'm in two minds really, I will openly admit it's a fun watch but I didn't think it was as brilliant as many seem to think, I doubt I'd watch it again anytime soon & I didn't have as much fun with it as I'd hoped, overall I'd say I was a little disappointed.Director Wright does a good job, it's shot like a TV soap opera at times although he manages to juggle the comedy, romance & horror quite well. It's not scary & I didn't find it laugh out loud funny either but I'm sure many of you out there do/will. I like the laddish approach that the modern British male would barricade themselves in a pub & wait for it to blow over rather than head for the plush & sensible surroundings of a supermarket as seen in Dawn of the Dead (1978). There's some gore, someone is torn apart at the end, there are someone gunshot wounds to the head but little else worth mentioning.With a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 Shaun of the Dead is well made although there isn't a great deal of style or flair to it. The acting is good & the cast make their character's pretty likable.Shaun of the Dead is a decent fun homage to Romero's zombie films, to be brutally honest I'd rather see one of those again than this though. Worth a watch for sure but not as good as I'd hoped & I feel it's slightly overrated.",6,53,97,3 January 2007
Hostel," Top quality gore film, I liked it & bugger all the politically correct out there...
","Hostel starts in Amsterdam where three friends, two Americans named Paxton (Jay Hernandez) & Josh (Derek Richardson) plus an Icelandic guy named Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson), are backpacking looking to travel across Europe getting laid by pretty girls, to party & to smoke some drugs. At the hostel where they are staying they meet Alex (Lubomir Bukovy) who tells them of a youth hostel in Bratislava in Slovakia where there are plenty of young beautiful girls who love Americans, the next day & the three friends travel there by train. They meet two girls, Natayla (Barbara Nedelijakova) & Svetlana (Jana Kaderabkova), who show them all a good time at a disco. The next morning & Oli has disappeared without leaving a message, then soon after Josh disappears leaving just Paxton to figure things out. He eventually discovers the gruesome truth...Written, co-produced & directed by Eli Roth I wasn't sure what to expect going into Hostel, I mean I hated his previous film the horror comedy Cabin Fever (2002) & it seems to get a lot of criticism from people saying it's a pointless film filled with nudity & gore. But never let it be said I don't give a film a chance & I went into Hostel with an open mind, in the end I'm glad I spent the time watching Hostel because I have to say I really rather liked it. The script by Roth takes it's time to get going, in fact the first hour is almost total exposition with Roth setting the situation up & fleshing out the character's which makes the final 30 blood soaked minutes of carnage even more satisfying & actually have some meaning. The final third of Hostel is really intense & gory film-making with bags of tension that the films critics seem to overlook, in fact I think the PC brigade dislike & attack Hostel so much because it is so effective & is a downright decent, if admittedly brutal & gory, horror film. Some of the twists & turns are a little hard to swallow but that only serves to reinforce the fact that Hostel is pure fantasy which is also something the idiotic PC brigade conveniently seem to forget. I liked it & I'm not ashamed to admit it, I liked all the nudity & sex, I liked the drug taking, I liked the brutality, I loved the gore & all those frigid members of the PC brigade can stick that in their pipe & smoke it! Interestingly no-one is actually shown being killed on screen in the slaughterhouse torture scenes yet whenever Paxton is shown to kill someone it is seen.Director Roth was apparently heavily influenced by executive producer Quentin Tarantino & that's no bad thing, there are some truly horrific scenes in Hostel. I loved the atmosphere as well, the scene when Josh wakes up in the room almost naked tied to a chair & he can only make out a light & two tables full of scissors, scalpels, medical equipment & knifes is very chilling & unsettling. Imagine being in Josh's position? There is some heavy duty gore but surprisingly not that much actual on screen violence, someone tries to walk with the backs of their ankles cut open, someone gets a drill poked into their body, fingers are graphically severed, legs are sliced off with chainsaws, someone commits suicide by jumping in front of a train (a really juicy sound effect as well), there are shots of someone with their chest cut open, there's loads of blood with over 150 gallons of the stuff being used to make the film, severed heads & limbs strewn about the place, someone is shot through the head, there's a couple of slashed throats & my favourite scene when a girl is seen with her eyeball hanging out of it's socket by some veins & Paxton cuts it off with a pair of scissors. The special make-up effects by KNB are top notch, very gory & very impressive.With a supposed budget of about $4,500,000 & making over 20 million on it's opening weekend Hostel is well made with great special effects & great production values. Although not set there Hostel was filmed mostly in the Czech Republic. Apparently Hostel was written, made & released theatrically all within 12 months which is very quick. The acting is alright from an unknown cast, extreme Japanese director Takashi Miike has a small cameo as a Japanese businessman who Paxton ask's what it's like inside.Hostel is a great film in my opinion, I liked it a lot, I liked it excessiveness & gore & gratuitous nudity. Despite a slow first half when it gets going this is a great horror flick that is pretty intense at times. It's also nice to see a horror film cause some debate, controversy & extreme opinion again. Followed by Hostel: Part II (2007).",7,4,10,22 November 2007
Oldboy," Didn't do anything for me.
","Oldboy is set in Korea & starts as a drunken Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted, Dae-su wakes up & finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years. Dae-su is fed & looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, Dae-su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick. However before Dae-su finishes he is gassed & rendered unconscious, when he wakes up Dae-su finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed & all moneyed up. Dae-su instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the pretty Mido (Hye-jeong Kang) the two fall in love & together with her help Dae-su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price...This South Korean production was co-written & directed by Chan-wook Park & has gotten any number of glowing reviews (the sort that distributors can pick quotes out & plaster them on the video box) & even won the Grand Prize of the Jury at Cannes while it was also nominated for the Golden Palm so surely Oldboy is a true classic? Well not for me it isn't since as I can't understand why it's so liked & I would go as far as to say I pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments. For a start I couldn't get into the story at all, I just didn't like it as I thought it was slow & boring & while many out there would have you believe Oldboy has the bestest most shocking twist ever I thought it was rather plain & not very well executed either. The ending in which Dae-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending. At almost two hours I almost fell asleep I was so bored, the violence is tame & it's the thought of what's happening that I would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown. In fact Oldboy has a very low body count of about seven & one mild sex scene, it's really not that graphic or memorable. I didn't warm to any of the character's & while I accept Oldboy has an alright concept & premise it fails to deliver & it's one film that I will never understand why so many people seem to like.Based on a Japanese Manga of the same name Oldboy the film looks alright, there's one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about the hallway fight that takes place in one continuous shot I was pretty unimpressed & thought the fight choreography was quite dull. The actual on-screen gore violence amounts to very little, Dae-su eats a live Octopus which is apparently quite normal in Korea anyway, there are some fight scenes, a severed hand, someones teeth are pulled out & there's a bit of blood at the end.The budget was supposedly around the $4,000,000 mark which is actually a fair bit, filmed in South Korea & New Zealand. The acting looks alright but it's hard to tell when actors are speaking a different language.Oldboy is a film that I found an absolute chore to sit through, I don't mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as I followed the thing perfectly but I just didn't like any of it & it's as simple & straightforward as that. Apparently the second in director Choi-wook Park's revenge trilogy which also includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) & Lady Vengeance (2005).",3,40,75,30 October 2009
Spider-Man 2," Better than the first.
","Spider-Man 2 is set about two years after the events of the original where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) now lives in New York City & is having all sorts of problems, he has no money, the fact he is Spider-Man is destroying his relationship with both his childhood love Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) & his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) & his schoolwork is suffering. Parker decides to leave Spider-Man behind & just live his life, while researching a college project about scientist Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) Parker is invited to a demonstration of Octavius' new fusion based energy source but the demonstration goes wrong. The four mechanical arms attached to Octavious designed to help him work malfunction & take control of his mind turning him into a crazed madman intent on finishing his dangerous experiments even if means the destruction of New York, that is unless Spider-Man can stop him...Directed by Sam Raimi this was the sequel to the blockbusting live action Spider-Man (2002) that went into production before the original even opened to such impressive box-office numbers, on a personal level I actually slightly prefer Spider-Man 2 to the original. The script by Alvin Sargent based on the popular Marvel comic book character is a continuation of many plot lines from the original, Peter's relationship with Mary Jane & Harry, his feelings of guilt over his uncle's death, his superpowers ruining his normal life & his coming to terms with his powers. In fact almost the entire first hour & a half feels like a soap opera with the film firmly focused on Peter Parker's various problems & dramas, the character of Doc Ock is relegated to a minor role for the majority of the film which is my biggest gripe with Spider-Man 2 really. I mean I don't want to watch a film such as Spider-Man 2 & find myself looking at a bland soap opera, I want special effects, I want spectacular action set-pieces & I want cool imaginative villains. Like many recent films there are at least a couple of different versions available, the original theatrical & DVD cut, the Spider-Man 2.1 extended cut & maybe even another different TV version, I really hate this practise of putting multiple versions out by big studios. The standard theatrical cut runs for a little over two hours & despite some truly outstanding action sequences I felt overall it was rather uneventful & I just ended up sitting there during the soap opera type moments waiting for Doc Ock to show up again.Director Raimi does a fine job here & there are some amazing set-piece action scenes, the fight Spider-Man & Doc Ock have on the speeding train in particular is spectacular. Apparently the CGI computer effects budget was $54 million & most of the CGI is outstanding & as good as anything out there, from dizzy shots of Spider-Man swinging through the streets of New York to Doc Ock's tentacles who all have individual personalities & another amazing scene when Spider-Man & Doc Ock have a fight on the side of a building. I have to say Doc Ock is maybe my favourite Spider-Man villain, I used to watch the old 60's cartoon series, & I'm a bit disappointed with him here. I not disappointed in how he looks, with a combination of CGI & puppet effects the character looks amazing with some great shots of him walking & climbing using his tentacles but he just wasn't evil enough for me, his whole plan was to carry on with his fusion energy source machine & nothing else. He didn't want to take over the world, he didn't want any money, he didn't even want to hurt anyone & his motives just seemed weak & uninteresting. Also, if the tentacles took over his mind & were partly controlling him what did they want? What difference to them would it have made if he had finished his fusion machine? One more thing, I understand that the tentacles were strong but surely Doctor Octavius was still a normal human being, while the tentacles could have survived falling 1000's of feet from a skyscraper onto a moving train why did Doctor Octavius as a normal human being survive? As I said I thought he was still human, there was nothing in the film to indicate he suddenly became invincible, was there? I know it's a comic book superhero film but it still needs to be based in some sort of reality for it to work.With a supposed budget of about $200,000,000 this was the most expensive film ever made at the time along with Titanic (1997), this definitely has that big budget Hollywood look & feel & has exceptional special effects & is very well made. The original score by Danny Elfman was replaced by one from Christopher Young at the last minute who composed the music for Hellraiser (1987), if you listen the first time Doctor Octavius walks towards the fusion device during the demonstration & while he is working on it the music is exactly the same as in Hellraiser! Set in New York but filmed in both New York & Los Angeles. The acting is fine, J.K. Simmons as Parker's boss J. Johna Jameson puts in another funny performance while Molina is pretty good as Doc Ock & Willem Defoe makes a small cameo at the end.Spider-Man 2, or the 2.1 extended cut, is a good solid comic book superhero film that wastes a great villain in Doc Ock & only has some spectacular action set-piece sequences going for it. The dull drama about Peter Parker's personal life drags it down to slightly above average, good but not great. Followed by Spider-Man 3 (2007) & Spider-Man 4 (2009).",6,0,1,14 December 2007
The Fifth Element," Spectacular sci-fi action comedy.
","The Fifth Element is set in the year 2263 where Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) works as a taxi driver in New York City. Deep in outer space a large moon like fiery planet has appeared from nowhere, not knowing what it is several Earth spaceships fire rockets into it but it only gets bigger & destroys the ships. Father Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm) tries to tell the president (Tommy 'Tiny' Lister) of an ancient legend where a force of pure evil will destroy all life in the universe & that he believes it has finally come & that a bunch of friendly aliens known as the Mondoshawan hold the key to defeating it with the four elements -wind, Earth, fire, water- & a mysterious fifth element. As they try to land on Earth the Mondoshawan spaceship is shot down by a race of aliens called Mangalore's hired by evil billionaire Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman), however a hand is found in the wreckage & using it's DNA scientists create a body for it & it turns out to be a beautiful woman (Milla Jovovich) who escapes & ends up in the back of Korben's taxi who then becomes involved in finding the four elements & the mysterious fifth...This French production was written & directed by Luc Besson & I thought The Fifth Element was a wonderfully over-the-top sci-fi action flick that probably won't be to all tastes but it was certainly to mine. Besson apparently wrote the script while he was in high school which means absolutely nothing & is a lot of fun, it's action packed, it moves along like a rocket, there are some nice ideas here & it shows some imagination rather than just being a rehash. I liked all the character's in this, from Willis' special ops taxi driver to Jovovich's fragile yet interesting alien Leeloo to Chris Tucker's over-the-top gay DJ who you'll either love or hate to Holm's dotty priest to Gary Oldman's sinister villain. Having said that neither the hero Bruce Willis or the villain Gary Oldman ever meet on screen which sounds odd but is true. There are some colourful character's in here & some suitably odd looking aliens. The Fifth Element has a fantastic blend of substance & style, the story is good & eminently watchable while the film simply oozes with style & class. I thought some of the sci-fi elements were cool with a great comic book like interpretation of the future with flying cars & ultra compact apartments where things fold away into the walls to save space, the comedy & light heartiness worked well too with some nice one-liners & a fair amount of quotable dialogue & it's action scenes were similarly impressive with various gunfights, explosions, bombs & martial arts scenes, I mean it's all here what more do you want?Director Besson shines here as The Fifth Element is a stylish masterpiece, I've always though film was a visual medium & I love it when filmmakers just let loose & try to make something visually stunning & in The Fifth Element I think they've succeeded with panache. From the bright colour schemes to the constant use of shapes & angles to the imaginative & still pretty impressive special effects which were probably a mixture of traditional model work & CGI computer effects to the cinematography The Fifth Element has to be one of the best looking sci-fi films ever & it's a film I could watch purely on an aesthetic level regardless of the story. I love the look of the film, the design of the spaceships & the outlandish costumes designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier in which Bruce Willis goes from his trademark white vest from Die Hard (1988) to a bright orange one here which I thought was a nice little touch & maybe a nod to his earlier success. The aliens look good too & as a whole this is a joy to watch.With a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 The Fifth Element at the time it was made was the biggest budget none Hollywood film & one has to say the money show's on screen with plenty of special effects & a convincingly realised futuristic world, it was largely shot in England & has high production values. The cinematography is great but please, please, please make sure you watch it in widescreen. The acting is pretty good, I've always liked Bruce Willis & I like him in this, Chris Tucker is sort of annoying but not enough to totally spoil it.The Fifth Element is a fantastic sci-fi action film that's as good to look at as anything out there, the style together with an entertaining story & Bruce Willis pretty much means The Fifth Element is a personal favourite of mine, what can I say? Watch it as soon as you can.",8,11,19,10 August 2007
The Mummy," Good big budget fantasy/adventure/horror film.
","The Mummy is set during 1926 & tells the tale of wannabe Egyptian archaeologist Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) & her brother Jonathan (John Hannah) who steals a rare Egyptian artifact from soon-to-be hanged American soldier Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) that Evelyn believes came from the lost city of Hamunaptra, dubbed the city of the dead. In a bid to discover the whereabouts of Hamunaptra Evelyn & Jonathan manage to save Rick who promises to take them to Hamunaptra & indeed does. Once there they find the ominous sounding book of the dead & after Evelyn foolishly reads some of the ancient incantations the mummifies remains of an evil high priest named Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) come to life. Imhotep then sets about resurrecting his ancient love Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez) & spreading his evil throughout the world...Written & directed by Stephen Sommers this is a big budget remake of the black and white version of The Mummy (1932) & I actually much prefer this film over the original. The script is very different to the original & in reality only the central Imhotep character & the title remain, while the original was pretty slow going horror this is a big fast & furious overblown action adventure that's as comparable to an Indiana Jones film as it is to any horror film. There's plenty of action, fights, shoot-outs, CGI special effects & huge set pieces. It's a very enjoyable ride & the film provides good entertainment, I though it was perhaps a little slow at times as it's almost an hour before Imhotep is resurrected & that side of the film kicks in. The film never takes itself seriously which is fine I suppose but I thought there was maybe a bit too much family orientated comedy relief. If your looking for big budget action & CGI effects then you could do a lot worse than The Mummy.Director Sommers does a decent enough job, there's plenty of flashy special effects & camera trickery. The action scenes are well shot as are the horror elements although it was clearly aimed at a fairly young audience.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 The Mummy is as well made as you would expect & has that Hollywood polish to it. According to the IMDb the Nile scenes were shot in Surrey in England! Not that you'd ever know it unless you were told... The acting was OK although I thought Kevin J. O'Conor as Benni became very annoying.The Mummy is a good big budget action adventure that will entertain most. A bit shallow & maybe there's not a whole lot to it but it's good fun, definitely worth a watch & I can't really see anyone not enjoying it to some extent. Followed by the even better The Mummy Returns (2001).",7,0,2,11 October 2006
The Others," Good but not quite as good as many make out.
","The Others is set on 'Jersey, The Channel Islands 1945' where Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives in a large mansion with her two young children Anne (Alakina Mann) & Nicholas (James Bentley) who suffer from an incredibly rare disease in which exposure to bright light could kill them. Three friends, the elderly Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) & a young mute girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) turn up at Grace's home looking for work as servants & luckily for them the previous servants left a week ago. Grace gives them all jobs & tells them their duties. Grace warns them that her daughter Anne is prone to telling lies & making stories up & it's not long before she is telling Bertha about other people in the house although at first there is no evidence that there are, however as children's crying is heard, strange noises emanate from empty rooms & doors open & close by themselves it appears that Anne may be telling the truth...This Spanish, American & French co-production was written & directed by Chilean-born, Spanish based Alejandro Amenabar who also composed the music & I liked it, I didn't think it was amazing & I have one or two reservations about it but overall I thought it was an effective little ghost film. The script is pretty slow going even at the best of times & tries to return to the days where horror relied on good storytelling instead of relying on special effects, violence & bad language. It moves along at a sedate pace but the character's are decent & it's sort of involving, it manages to draw the viewer in quite well & all the careful build up helps the effective twist ending. A lot has been said about the twist & I for one think it works extremely well although there simply is no denying that it's more or less exactly the same as The Sixth Sense (1999) which was made at least two years prior to The Others. I'm in two minds over The Others, I liked it for what it was but it was slow going & sometimes I found it hard to maintain my interest in it & the effectiveness of the entire film depends upon it's ending which is great if you haven't seen The Sixth Sense but if you have I'd imagine you'd feel a little de ja vu & not be too impressed. There are a few holes in the plot & logic but nothing too detrimental.Director Amenabar does a fantastic job of giving the film a creepy look & atmosphere, the colours & the the use of light & shadow are excellent. There are some nice shots & some eerie scenes although on the negative side it's a bit lifeless & bland at times. The 40's period setting suits the film perfectly & it's superbly realised throughout. There's no gore or violence & I can't remember any rubbish CGI computer effects (yeah!).With a supposed budget of about $17,000,000 The Others is well made & has nice period production design, it shows that a lot of time went into the look of the film. While watching The Others I realised that because of the types of films that I like (horror, exploitation, low budget, sci-fi, etc.) I haven't actually seen a Nicole Kidman film before now. I was impressed & I thought she was great, she's very pretty & very good in this. Her ex Tom Cruise was an executive producer on The Others, presumably before they split. Everyone else does a fine job including ex Doctor Who (2005) Christopher Eccleston.The Others is a good solid ghost story that I found watchable & effective, unfortunately it's a bit on the slow side & the ending really isn't as original or groundbreaking as it could have been although it's still highly effective. Well worth a watch but I doubt many would want to see it more than once so perhaps wait for it to turn up on TV or cable.",7,1,3,13 August 2006
Orphan," A nicely twisted & memorable horror film.
","Orphan starts as Kate (Vera Farmiga) & John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) decide to adopt a child after Kate suffers a miscarriage, Kate & John visit Saint Mariana's Home for Girls where they meet & are charmed by a seemingly angelic nine year old Russian girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) who they quickly decide to adopt. Taking Esther home she seems perfect & both Kate & John are overjoyed, even if their son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) isn't. Esther seems different, she dresses strangely & whenever something bad happens she always seem to be around. A girl at school breaks her leg while playing with Esther, Esther swears & starts to cause tension in the house between Kate & John. Kate investigates Esther's past & discovers some shocking secrets that ester will literally kill to keep secret...This American, Canadian, German & French co-production was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra & is a great twisted psycho horror thriller that I really didn't expect to be so good or so disturbed. I am sure there are many out there who will consider the idea of an orphaned child being a sick deformed killer who threatens other children & is generally very nasty to be reprehensible, well I say screw then since Orphan is a terrific piece of exploitation entertainment that had more depth than I expected too. At about two hours Orphan takes a while to get going but I never found myself getting bored & all the build-up & scene setting is essential for the insidious events that follow, I just love the idea behind Orphan & a deranged deformed killer passing herself off as a sweet little girl is just a really sick concept, it makes me feel good inside there are still filmmakers out there who are making good exploitative trash. The character's are well fleshed out, the whole family comes across well & the things Esther does & says are just great. While some may find it a little slow going at times I though all the build-up was justified & actually has a decent pay-off at the end. The films main twist could have been explained a little better with a bit more background but it still has impact & is memorable.I brought Orphan on Blu-ray yesterday & there are some deleted scenes which add nothing & a short alternative ending in which Esther lives. There aren't that many special effects here, I think there's a bit of CGI fire which looks OK & some blood splatter but it's not the goriest film you will ever see & it relies on it's twisted concept to keep one creeped out. Shot in snow covered locations Orphan looks pretty nice, the Blue-ray suggests that the colours were muted in post but otherwise it looks nice enough. The loud noise style jump scares are here aplenty & are reasonably well pulled off.Filmed in Ontario in Canada although set in the US the production values are nice. The acting is alright, Peter Sarsgaard looks a little bored although Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther is fantastic & strikes a great balance between sweetness & evil.Orphan is a film that I enjoyed far more than I thought I would, the story is deeper than i thought & the film as a whole held my interest much more than I expected. A real exploitative treat with a twisted story that is it's biggest asset.",7,3,10,20 August 2010
The Day After Tomorrow," Some nice CGI special effect sequences but not much else.
","The Day After Tomorrow starts in New Delhi at a United Nations global warming conference where palaeoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) tries to tell US Vice President Becker (Kenneth Welsh) that the world is headed for another ice age if they don't sign up to the Kyoto Accords & cut greenhouse gasses immediately. With the Vice President more interested in the US economy Hall's pleas fall on deaf ears. Then shortly after British scientist Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) contacts Hall to tell him his equipment has detected a sudden & drastic lowering of temperatures around Greenland caused by huge icecaps melting & breaking off into the Ocean. A climate imbalance causes massive storms across the Northern Hemisphere & minus 170 degree temperatures which freeze & kill anyone caught in it on contact, as America begins to freeze solutions are sought but it might be too late already...Co-written, co-produced & directed by Roland Emmerich this action blockbuster warning about the perils of global warming was a huge hit when originally released although I have to say I didn't think it was any better than average. The script by Emmerich & Jeffrey Nachmanoff is basically a modern updating of all those natural disaster flicks from the 70's like Earthquake (1974), The Towering Inferno (1974), Avalanche (1978) & Meteor (1979) in which nature strikes & causes havoc & danger only The Day After Tomorrow gets the mega budget Hollywood treatment & revolves around the currently very topical issue of global warming & our changing climate. The first thing to say about The Day After Tomorrow is that it is not scientifically accurate & doesn't really try to be, the events in the film which take place over several weeks in reality would takes decades if not centuries. I thought it went on for too long, at two hours in length I found myself becoming increasingly bored with it & I just don't think there's enough story here to maintain ones interest. Then there's the horrible attempts at soap opera style emotion & sentimentality with the final twenty odd minutes set what sounded like violins as it rounded up all the 'human nature' stories & subplots as Jack found his son (if Jack was aware that the storm would kill anyone out in it why did he travel to New York when realistically speaking he would know he would have been killed too?), the cringe worthy speech at the end by the President thanking other countries for their assistance & the perils of ignoring global warming & taking our planet for granted, the scenes of people having survived in New York on the rooftops, the scene of the boy in Hospital being saved & the final shot of a clear unpolluted Earth from space are just ever so slightly embarrassing. The character's are pretty thin, I didn't really care about anyone, all the coincidences are just daft although there are some seriously impressive CGI effects & some memorable imagery such as the scenes of destruction in New York.The one thing that does save The Day After Tomorrow are some terrific set-piece action sequences & some impressive CGI computer effects. From the devastating affects of tornado's sweeping through Los Angeles to huge waves crashing through New York to the image of a huge tanker ship sailing though the streets & between the skyscrapers of Manhattan. The film was promoted with the claim that it was the first Hollywood film to be 'carbon neutral' & environmentally friendly I suppose. While the special effects are impressive & there are some good set-piece scenes I still found the film rather slow going, a bit heavy handed especially when it came to the emotion & sentiment at the end & just too long.With a supposed budget of about $125,000,000 The Day After Tomorrow had an opening US box-office weekend take of $85,000,000 which is huge, to be honest although all the impressive CGI effects make for a great looking trailer I still don't think the actual film is much better than average. The acting is alright but nothing great, Quaid is OK as the hero while Ian Holm is wasted in small cameo role.The Day After Tomorrow is a OK if unspectacular environmental disaster flick that I found hard to remain interested in, sure the CGI is great but the story & character's are fairly weak. Not bad but not great.",5,5,10,16 July 2008
X-Men," Not my favourite comic book superhero flick.
","X-Men is set in the near future where evolution has gone haywire, strange genetic mutations have begun to reveal themselves & 'normal' people including politicians are scared of them, their powers & what their existence means. Treated like freaks & outcasts mutants are shunned by normal society & Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) is trying to get a law passed in which every mutant has to be registered & therefore controlled. Not everyone likes his idea & evil mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen) who can control metal objects with his powerful psychic abilities wants to wage a war against normal human beings as he believes mutants are the future. However Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) runs a private school in New York for young mutants & also leads a team of mutants known as X-Men who use their unique abilities for good & are determined to stop Magneto & his evil plans to wipe out the human race...Directed by Bryan Singer this along with Spider-Man (2002) really kicked off the whole Marvel comic book superhero trend that has continued with the likes of Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Punisher: War Zone (2008) from the Marvel stable & Hancock (2008), Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008) & of course the mega hit The Dark Knight (2008) this year alone. To be honest I am not a huge fan of the comic book superhero genre & I personally just don't think character's designed to be drawn in 2-D make the transition to live action film that well. With the possible exception of the Blade trilogy of films & the Spider-Man franchise I just can't get that excited by them. Here in X-Men the film concentrates on only some of the character's, the actual comic books contained more X-Men & evil mutant bad guys for them to fight with the main focus of the story being Wolverine who goes from shunned outcast into a superhero. The script is alright but I really can't raise any more enthusiasm for it, the plot about Magneto bombarding politicians & world leaders with radiation to turn them into mutants is rather basic actually, X-Men is more of a character driven film but as I said I just don't think character's like the X-Men translate to film that well. There are obvious allegories & references to racism, intolerance & acceptance too just to try & add some dramatic weight & give the audience a moral message to think about. The X-Men, mutants & their powers can often look silly, some of the CGI computer effects don't do them any favours & it's hard to relate to them in any way as 'people'. At only just over 100 odd minutes at least it's a lot shorter than the average two hour plus superhero film, it moves along at a decent pace & it tells a reasonable story but I must say I couldn't get into it, I couldn't get into the world of the X-Men & what they were about & I did lose interest in the film & it's plot quite quickly although I did manage to watch it all without becoming bored.The special effects are generally very good as one would expect, there's plenty of CGI ranging from the impressive to the substandard Playstation game graphics. I was also a bit disappointed in the villains, Sabretooth doesn't do much, Mystique is very blue while Toad just looks daft & if I was him I would be very upset if I saw the immense & useful power mutants like Magneto & Wolverine had & I had to be happy with pale green skin & a long tongue! The final climatic battle is set on the Statue of Liberty & is quite good as are all the set-pieces but I couldn't honestly say they were much better than quite good. I only saw it last night & the only scenes I remember are the ones at the train station & the final fight. Apparently 20th century Fox originally approached Tim Burton to direct by turned it down, imagine how that X-Men Tim Burton style might have turned out!With a supposed budget of $75,000,000 X-Men was fairly low budget for a summer blockbuster which usually have $100,000,000 plus budgets. Although set entirely in the US the film was shot almost entirely in Canada. The acting is OK, Patrick Stewart & Sir Ian McKellen add the distinguished weight while Hollywood starts of the day Halle Berry & Hugh Jackman get plum roles as X-Men.X-Men is a film that I can't say I loved & yet I can't say I hated, I just found it watchable & not much else, nothing more or nothing less. There are worse films out there to be sure but if your not a comic book superhero fan than you can live without seeing X-Men. Followed by X2 (2003) & X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) while two money grabbing spin-offs X-Men Origins: Magneto (2009) & X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) are due out next year.",5,2,4,1 August 2008
Spider-Man 3," I really didn't like this one at all.
","Spider-Man 3 starts as Spider-Man's alter-ego Peter parker (Tobey Maguire) is set to propose to his long time childhood girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), however Pater's best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) still blames him for the death of his father & is intent on killing Spider-Man. Meanwhile an escaped convicted murdered named Flint Marco (Thomas Haden Church) wander into a restricted proton testing range & is zapped with the result of his body being molecularly combined with sand, as the almost invincible shape-shifting Sandman he sets out to steal enough money to pay for an operation to save his daughters life as Spider-Mantries to stop him. At the same time humiliated newspaper photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is consumed by some parasitic black alien slime that makes Eddie evil & intent on killing Peter Parker & Spider-Man, both the Sandman & Brock team up together to kill Spider-Man their common enemy...Cowritten & directed by Sam Raimi this was the third of the hugely successful live action Spider-Man films that have broken box-office records all over the world, personally I am not a huge comic book fan & I have no real liking for Spider-Man himself but I did enjoy the first two Spider-Man films although I thought Spider-Man 3 was absolutely terrible & a massive bore from start to finish. To be honest my main complaint about Spider-Man 3 is that it just felt like a rehash of the the previous two films ideas & themes without ever being as good as either of them, the strained relationship between Parker & Mary Jane, the tensions between Parker & his best friend Harry, some super villain or other terrorising New York, his landlord asking for the rent, dealing with the death of his Uncle & the problems of being a teenager are all recycled here to dull effect. At almost two & a half hours long Spider-Man 3 felt like it went on forever to me, I was really bored by the time this thing had finished. The film has themes like people's dark sides (here the script deals with hero's that have a dark side & villains that have a sympathetic side) & such but the idea that Paker just needed to pull his hair down a bit & do funny walks down New York would get all the girls to throw themselves at him come across as ridiculous. Cranky newspaper editor Johna Jameson livens things up with some very funny scenes but other than that Spider-Man 3 just felt lifeless & bland. Even the villains aren't that great, Venom only appears during the last twenty minutes while the Sandman is given a back-story about his daughter & the fact he killed Peter's Uncle which were not in the comic books & just feels a bit pointless other than to carry on the themes from the first two films.I brought this really cheap on a second hand Blu-Ray & I have to say I want my money back, an unimpressive film & a flat looking Blue-Ray means the hi-def CGI computer effects look pretty average at times. The action set-pieces this time around feel laboured & daft, the fight between Peter & Harry on a glider feels like a video game while I personally thought the crane smashing into the skyscraper was the best moment although the giant Sandman at the end is quite cool but doesn't really do much. Personally I don't think any sequence here comes anywhere near as close to the two sequences in Spider-Man 2 where Spider-Man & Doctor Ock battle it out climbing up skyscrapers or the cool out of control train fight scene. The CGI varies, some of it is excellent while at other times it's rather fake looking. The IMDb's Trivia section lists all sorts of facts & figures that I assume are meant to impress but only disappoint more as the amount of time, money & effort spent on Spider-Man 3 was enormous & the end product just so bad. It's no surprise to learn that there were re-shoots that went on for eight months apparently.With a reported budget of around $250,000,000 plus addition re-shoots, evolving CGI computer effect technology insiders say this might have cost as much as $350,000,000 in the end. The acting is OK but I just didn't warm to anyone particularly & Maguire's bad boy sequence is just laughable.Spider-Man 3 is a film that I really disliked, I was literally sat there wanting it to finish so I could watch something else I was that bored by it. The first two Spider-Man films are much better than this huge disappointment & waste of huge potential.",3,2,10,1 April 2010
The Terminator," 'You've been targeted for termination.' A genuine 100% classic.
","The Terminator starts in the future post apocalyptic year of 2029 where the machine has taken complete control & are engaging in a war intent on wiping mankind out, after realising they have lost the war against mankind the machines send a T-800 cybernetic terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to 1984 Los Angeles where it is programmed to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) the mother of the leader of the resistance who in the future will defeat the machines. At the same time the resistance is able to send back a protector for Sarah, a soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) in an attempt to prevent her termination by the killer cyborg. The streets of Los Angeles become the fighting ground for the very future of humanity as Sarah must survive or all hope for mankind will be lost...This English American co-production was co-written & directed by James Cameron & has gone on to become widely acknowledged as just about the best sci-fi action film of the 80's & maybe even to this point it hasn't been bettered, it's an iconic film with many moments that have become part of pop culture & the amount of killer robot flicks that have followed is also a testament to it's popularity & influence. The script by Cameron & producer Gale Ann Hurd is a terrific action packed thoughtful & intelligent sci-fi thriller, it has a great pace about it with plenty of car chases, shoot-outs, fights & futuristic battle scenes to satisfy most action junkies & plenty of robots, an extremely well thought out time travel story that makes perfect sense & an underlying message about putting too much faith in machines & computers in an era when the modern PC hadn't even been invented & I guess Cameron just saw the way things were going. There's so much to enjoy here & so little to not not like, from exciting action set-pieces set both in the present & the future, some great special effects that hold up pretty well even today, a really good solid sci-fi story which is well thought out & easy to pick up & understand while still managing to be gripping & a really fast pace which simply doesn't allow the viewer to become bored although there's still enough meaningful character development when needed for you to care for them & what happens to them. An almost perfect film & an absolute classic of the genre or indeed any genre, one of the best films ever made. Period.Director Cameron has since gone on to become one of the biggest director's in Hollywood with a string of huge films like Aliens (1986), The Abyss (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), True Lies (1994) the the most successful film ever made to date Titanic (1997) while The Terminator was his second full length feature film after the OK horror sequel Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981) & he does a great job of making his small budget go far. From the action scenes to the special effects The Terminator is an impressive film even today, OK some of the stop motion terminator effects aren't the best they still at least look alright. The film is very violent with lots of gun-play, there's also some gore as the terminator has to get rid of his damaged eye by inserting a scalpel into it & plucking it out, he also has to slice his arm open to repair some mechanics.With a supposed budget of about $6,400,000 this didn't have a particularly big budget but the film doesn't suffer as there's still more car chases, shoot-outs, special effects & fights than a lot of much higher budgeted Hollywood stuff from the time. The music is great, the effects are good, it's well made & the production values are high. The acting is very good all round, apparently only paid $75,000 Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role & he gets to say his trademark 'Ill be back' for the first time on screen.The Terminator is a solid gold 100% classic & it's as simple & straight forward as that. There quite simply isn't anything that I don't like about this film, definitely recommended. Followed by the equally as brilliant Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the not so brilliant but still enjoyable Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2008) while a third sequel Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins (2009) is apparently in production.",9,2,6,19 December 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Looks great but is a bit shallow.
","Hellboy II: The Golden Army starts at an auction in New York where the evil Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) steals a piece of the Crown of Bethmora which was to be sold, the son of Balor (Roy Dotrice), the king of the Elves, the Prince wants to break a centuries old truce between the Elves & mankind & reawaken the fearsome Golden Army of giant mechanical robotic soldiers. Prince Nuada needs two more pieces of the Crown, one of which his father Balor has & the other is with his sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton). After killing his father & reclaiming the second piece of the Crown his sister Nuala flees into the Troll market to try & protect herself & the third piece of the Crown. Meanwhile Hellboy (Ron Pearlman) the Bereau for Paranormal Research & Defense investigate the auction theft & the killing of everyone there, they follow the leads to the Troll market & Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) finds Princess Nuala who then joins forces with the Bereau to prevent Nuada getting hold of the third piece of the Crown...This American & German co-production was written & directed by Guillermo del Toro & is the follow-up to his original Hellboy (2004) which I thought was a very good comic book action adventure film & while I felt Hellboy II: The Golden Army isn't quite as good it's still a fine film full of fantasy & action. Based on character's in the Mike Mignola comic book Hellboy II: The Golden Army follows a similar path to many superhero comic book films with an eccentric hero, a few sidekicks, a super villain of some sort with an absurd plan to destroy/rule the world & lots of action set-pieces in which bad guy's try to kill good guy's. The most disappointing aspect of Hellboy II: The Golden Army is how linear the story is, just how predictable & routine it feels as everything feels old & without any significant twist's Hellboy II: The Golden Army is nothing more than a straight forward build-up to the final showdown between the hero & villain. Sure there's a bit of friction between Hellboy & Liz, Abe falls in love & a new member joins the team but director del Toro was obviously far more interested in the visuals & fantasy elements than the story & character's here, that's not to say Hellboy II: The Golden Army is terrible as even at two hours long it moves along at a fast pace, it never becomes boring, there's plenty of imaginative touches to keep you watching, there's the odd bit of humour that works & some that don't while it all adds up to a good time as long as you don't look past the flashy visuals for too long.As already mentioned the one area where Hellboy II: The Golden Army excels is in it's visual effects & creature design, from the guy with a wooden head carved like a cathedral to the giant clockwork army to the stone giant that rises from the ground to the guy who pushes himself along on carts since he has no legs, then there's Angel of Death with huge wings covered in blinking eye's, the Kitten eating Troll, the nasty Tooth Fairies & a huge plant like monster that rampages through New York. The CGI computer effects are excellent, the live action puppet effects are as well & it's clear a lot of time, effort & money went into the visual aspect of Hellboy II: The Golden Army. The look of the film is also superb with a fantastic opening flashback using wooden style animated puppets & an impressive climax set in a huge room full of moving cogs & wheels.With a supposed budget of about $72,000,000 this had triple the budget of the original Hellboy & it show's with much more elaborate action set-pieces & bigger effects. In mixing the superhero & fairy tale fantasy aspects Hellboy II: The Golden Army really does look terrific with a nice mix between practical & CGI computer effects work. Rupert Evans was unavailable for this sequel so was written out while the main villain Luke Goss was also the main villain in del Toror's Blade II (2002) in which he also plays the disgruntled son of a King out for revenge on mankind.Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a visual feast of fantasy, strange creatures & lush settings but as a film it's a bit empty, I definitely liked Hellboy II: The Golden Army & enjoyed it a lot but I would maybe stop just short of saying I loved it. Certainly better than many films out there & well worth watching.",6,1,2,8 July 2012
Cloverfield," Bettr than I expected.
","Cloverfield is set in New York City as a farewell party for Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) who has got a new job in Japan & is leaving soon, all his friends are there but after a row with his girlfriend Beth (Odette Yustman) she takes off. Then suddenly the ground shakes, looking outside the guests see huge explosions & building's collapsing. Soon it becomes apparent that a huge monster is making it's way through Manhattan destroying everything in it's path, Rob phone's Beth & learns that she is hurt, together with his best friend Hud (T.J. Miller) & a couple of girls from the party Rob decides to rescue Beth who is trapped inside her apartment but with a huge monster on the loose & the US military trying to kill it there's plenty of obstacles in their way...Directed by Matt Reeves I have to say that I enjoyed Cloverfield for what it was even though I didn't expect to, in fact I usually rant on about how I hate the modern hand-held jerky camera movement that to me just looks awful but here in Cloverfield it's used to good effect. The best way to describe Cloverfield would be a giant monster film like Godzilla (1998) but told from the perspective of a bunch of normal people caught up in the situation unaware of what is happening & acting on instinct. The idea that you would want to save your friends & family is perfectly natural to me although if you would go up against a huge monster to do so is another issue I suppose, I really liked the average person perspective actually & the character's here do feel quite natural & ordinary. Portable video devices are everywhere these days so recording the events isn't a stretch either although that camera does seem quite robust considering what it goes through. While watching some of the spectacular sequences in Cloverfield I couldn't help but think if this was meant to be a 9/11 thing with terrified people on the ground running from falling buildings & the utter confusion, fear & panic that would inevitably happen. At only 80 odd minutes this moves along like a rocket & after the first fifteen minutes never lets up, I thought it was pretty gripping & intense & I liked the downbeat ending as well, far too many Hollywood films take the easy happy option. Having said that Cloverfield isn't perfect, there is no explanation about the monsters origin or it's fate & I am not sure it would stand up to multiple viewings.The whole realistic shaky hand-held camera really does give the impression that your watching events unfold from some guy's point of view but it is a little too dark at times & a little too jerky although I am sure these were intentional by the makers. There's no real gore or violence, just a splash of blood really, Some of the CGI effects are very impressive, the monster itself, building's falling down, explosions & the Statue of Liberty's head getting dumped in the middle of New York. When you think about it though the makers of Cloverfield went to great lengths & probably spent a fair bit of money trying to make it look as low tech & low budget as they could, does anyone else see any sort of irony in that? Apart from during the end credits Cloverfield has no musical score & again that gives it a realistic feel.Filmed in just 34 days in Los Angeles & New York on a $25,000,000 budget Cloverfield looks cheap & inept but that was a very deliberate look & some of the CGI effects are very impressive. The acting by total unknown's is pretty good to be fair.Cloverfield is a monster film that tries to tell it's story from the viewpoint of the ordinary person, the person who is terrified & doesn't know what it going on & only instinct is make sure his family & friends are safe. It's also a 9/11 film, the imagery & it's implication is too blatant to be merely coincidence.",6,2,5,8 June 2010
Sleepy Hollow," I love this film.
","Sleepy Hollow starts in the year 1799 in the small community of Sleepy Hollow itself where fear is in the air, Peter Van Garrett (Martin Landau, uncredited) feels it & he has every right too as he & his son Dirk (Robert Sella) become the latest victims of a local legend the Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken) who likes to chop people's heads off... Cut to New York City where Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) has been given the task of travelling to Sleepy Hollow & discovering the identity of the killer, determined to prove that the killer is flesh & blood & not a ghost Crane sets about his task. Once there he is invited to stay with Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon) who fills him in, the community is steeped in superstition & fear as the locals are convinced that the Headless Horseman has come back from the grave to claim victims. As heads continue to roll Ichabod investigates the case which leads him to a sinister plot involving greed, mistrust, murder, dark secrets & revenge...This American German co-production was directed by Tim Burton & is quite simply one of my favourite horror films from the past few years. The script by Andrew Kevin Walker is based on the novel 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' by Washington Irving, which I have not read so I cannot compare them, is fantastic. Everything about it works brilliantly, I love the mystery elements that develop, the character's are great especially Ichabod, there's plenty of horror & a bit of romance, it moves along like a rocket, there's some good action scenes & I just found it a pleasure to watch. Everything is balanced really well, it's obviously a fantasy film but things never get too silly. Put quite simply Sleepy Hollow is a most excellent dark Gothic fairytale horror film, it's as simple & straight forward as that. I really can't think of anything negative to say, I liked that much.Director Burton does a brilliant job as one would expect, the attention to detail is flawless, the period costumes, sets, background details & locations all combine to create a fabulous atmosphere. Sleepy Hollow feels like the kind of film Hammer would have made if they had the money. The special effects are top-notch, from the Headless Horseman himself to the various gory decapitations of which there is a plentiful supply & they must be some of the best, most realistic & gory decapitations ever put on screen, good work. There is plenty of visual flair & style plus there are lots of references to other films including a really cool homage to the original Frankenstein (1931).With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 Sleep Hollow looks it, it's brilliantly made from the special effects to the action scenes to the overall production values. It was mostly shot in England using a strong British cast who all put in a decent shift. There's Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Richard Griffiths, Iain McDairmid, Michael Gough & Christopher Lee. I thought Depp was great & endearing as Ichabod.Sleepy Hollow, in my opinion, is a brilliant film & to be honest I can't quite put my finger on any one specific reason. I guess that everything works so well, the mystery, the horror, the immaculate period production design, the way it's shot, the character's & the cast who bring them to life, the gore, the action & even Danny Elfman's overblown score isn't as annoying as it usually is. This is an absolute must see so what are you waiting for?",9,2,4,5 October 2006
Snatch," 'Well, where'd you lose him? He ain't a set of f*cking car keys, is he? And it ain't as if he's incon-f*cking-spicuous now, is it?' One of my all time favourite films.
","Snatch starts in Antwerp where four guy's dressed as Jewish Rabai's gain entry & steal an 86 carat diamond from a building, one of the gang Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) smuggles it into London where he plans to sell it to crooked jewellery dealer Doug 'The Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid), however his Russian mates double cross him & informs shady Russian gangster Boris 'The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija) who hires two petty criminals Vincent (Robbie Gee) & Sol (Lennie James). Meanwhile boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) & his mate Tommy (Stephen Graham) are in big trouble as they have let down a vicious crime boss named Brick Top (Alan Ford), throw in some Irish pikey's, unlicensed boxing matches, dead bodies, betting shop hold ups & add hard as nails Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) hired to sort everything out as everyone's problems become connected...This British American co-production was written & directed by Madonna's other half Guy Ritchie & I'll say it straight away, Snatch is one of my favourite films of all time, period. I must admit after watching it again last night I wasn't looking forward to looking it up on the IMDb for fear of a horribly low score & lots of complaints from people about not understanding or getting it, particularly Americans, so imagine my surprise & delight when I discovered that Snatch is in fact in the IMDb's Top 250 films list (currently #183 but this will change sooner or later) & it certainly isn't a film which I thought would come into most people's heads when talking about the best 200 odd films ever made so I guess it's a testament to just how good Snatch is in that after 7 years from it's original release it still holds a place in the IMDb's Top 250 films of all time. A place, I might add, that I think it fully deserves. 'Who took the jam outta your doughnut?', 'You took the f*cking jam outta my doughnut!'. The script by Ritchie is quite simply the funniest thing ever put to film, I have seen Snatch several times & I still p*ss myself laughing at some of the one-liners, sarcastic jokes, humour, twists, character's & events. Snatch has more quotable lines of dialogue in it than any other film I've seen, I myself have used the 'how did you lose it, it's hardly a set of f*cking car keys' line so many times & never miss an opportunity to use it! The whole film maybe gets a little bit too silly at the end but who cares when it's this clever, this fun, this hilarious & this entertaining? 'What's in the car?', 'Seats and a steering wheel'. I'm sorry, I just love the one-liners in this & can just quote them all day long & not get bored. I love Snatch, I thinks it is absolutely brilliant in every single way from the character's to the clever plot which keeps you on your toes to the hilariously funny dialogue. Snatch is one of the few films about which I simply can't find anything negative to say at all, the absolutely perfect film to watch with some mates on DVD.Director Ritchie pulls out all the stop with an incredibly stylish & fast moving comedy crime thriller, the editing, the camera moves & the dull colour schemes which sum up the British weather perfectly just work like a dream in every respect. There's not much graphic violence although there's loads of profanity & bad language. There's plenty of clever visual gags as well as the funny one-liners & Snatch is just great to both listen to & watch. 'There are two types of balls. There are big brave balls & there are little mincey faggot balls.'With a modest sounding budget of about $10,000,000, well by Hollywood standards it's modest, Snatch has a perfect gloomy British look to it & there's some nice location shooting in & around London. The acting is brilliant from a great cast, everyone plays their roles straight & it's just so funny.Snatch is just about the perfect film, still being in the IMDb Top 250 films is by no means a guarantee of quality but it proves it has legs across a broad range of people most of who I'm pleased to discover get it & love it as much as I do. Guy Ritchie will never make another film as good as Snatch (just look at his next full feature film Swept Away (2002) staring his wife Madonna) & you will never see as good a comedy crime thriller as Snatch, that I promise you.",9,8,13,11 October 2007
The Expendables," Part old school, part modern noisy action blockbuster.
","The Expendables starts as Barney Ross (co-writer & director Sylvester Stallone), the leader & brains behind a gang of mercenaries, is hired by a Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) to overthrow General Garza (David Zayas) the vicious drug growing & trafficking dictator of the Island of Vilena in South America. Ross assembles his team, from weapons to explosive to martial arts experts who are highly trained. On a scouting mission to Vilena Ross meets local island girl Sandra (Giselle Itié) who puts her own life at risk to help Ross escape, moved by the act of bravery the mission becomes personal for Ross as he wants to help Sandra & the locals who live in fear of General Garza & his men but it seems the real enemy lies closer to home as General Gaza is controlled & used by an ex-CIA agent named James Munroe (Eric Roberts) for his own ends...Co-written & directed by Sylvester Stallone who also starred in the thing I'm guessing that The Expendables is meant as some sort of homage to the over the top action films of the 80' & 90's that many of the cast appeared in including Stallone & while not entirely successful anyone who holds that type of film in high regard & long for the days of the likes of Die Hard (1988), Cliffhanger (1993) & True Lies (1994) to name but three then The Expendables will satisfy your need for violence, big guns, cool weapons & huge explosions. The script is typical 80' action fare with almost superhuman action heroes taking on entire armies & winning while blowing lots of things up the process, maybe I'm easily pleased but I really don't see anything wrong with that all! The actual story & character's are less impressive, with so many recognisable faces in the cast it was going to be impossible to give everyone sizable roles & only really Stallone & Statham get any sort of character development. The plot is a little weak, again US Government agencies turn out to be the real villains but not much time is devoted to the plot. At a little under one hour & forty minutes long the pace is good even though there are one or two moments that it does drag but the final third is none stop shoot-outs, fights, explosions & death defying action set-pieces so all is not lost & there's plenty to look forward to as you sit through one or two of the slower moments.There hasn't been a film like The Expendables for ages & it's great to see an action film that uses proper stunt-men, proper explosions rather than CGI computer effects although there still is CGI here. From a cool plane with front mounted guns that Statham sticks his head out of to aim to huge knives to massive guns that literally blow people apart The expendables is quite macho & any guy looking for senseless action & violence is onto a winner. There's also a great car chase with a really cool looking black truck & numerous fights. While Stallone & Statham get sizable roles Jet Li is disappointingly left behind somewhat & he never really gets to show off his martial arts skills which surely is a waste of a great athlete & talent. Dolph Lundgren gives an odd performance as a junkie & it's great to see him & Li fight it out with contrasting styles. A word of warning though, The Expendables is very violence with a lot of knife play including slashed throats, chopped off hands & one straight through a bad guy's neck in gory detail while the bad guy's are also literally blown to bits with some serious fire power but in my book that's a definite plus.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 no expense has been spared with the action set-pieces from exploding palaces that collapse to armies of bad guy's shot down to some great locations in Rio de Janeiro. The cast is brilliant, from Stallone & Statham & Li (The Expendables is the third film that Statham & Li have starred in together after The One (2001) & War (2007)) to Lundgren & Eric Roberts to Steve Austin & Gary Daniels to Terry Crewes & Mickey Rourke to the cameos from Bruce Willis & Arnold Schwarzenegger. If only that had managed to get Chuck Norris, Steven Seagal & Jean-Claude Van Damme the entire 80's & 90's action star roster would have been here. I can dream I suppose.The Expendables is a throwback to the old school action flicks of the 80's & 90's while some modern filmmaking annoyances creep in occasionally like CGI, quick cut editing & shaky hand-held camcorder photography they are few & far between. I liked it for what it is & I loved the cast & the huge explosions & weapons on show, so sue me.",7,3,9,29 August 2010
Scary Movie 2," 'I'm fine... I broke my fall.' Absolutely hilarious to those with a slightly twisted sense of humour, like me...
","Scary Movie 2 starts at 'Hell House' as Father Mceely (James Woods) & Father Harris (Andy Ritcher) perform an exorcism on the possessed Megan Voorhees (Natasha Lyonne)... Jump 'One Year Later' where professor Oldman (Tim Curry) & his wheelchair bound assistant Dwight Hartman (David Cross) select various students to accompany them to Hell House to experience & measure paranormal activity. Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Buddy (Chris Masterson), Brenda (Regina Hall) & Shorty Meeks (co-writer Marlon Wayans), Ray Wilkins (co-writer Shawn Wayans), Theo (Kathleen Robertson) & Alex Monday (Tori Spelling) are all told by professor Oldman that they have been selected to stay at Hell House for a weekend to study various sleep disorders for a school project. Once there they discover the freakish servant Hanson (Chris Elliott) who quickly becomes the least of their worries are they encounter the evil ghost of the previous owner Hugh Kane (Richard Moll) & a whole host of other spooky goings on...Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans Scary Movie 2 was the first sequel to the horror spoof Scary Movie (2000), the series is now up to Scary Movie 4 (2006), & I personally thought it was better than the original & quite simply I found it totally hilarious. The script by Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Alyson Fouse, Greg Grabianski, Dave Polsky, Michael Anthony Snowden & Craig Wayans spoofs just about every well known horror film there is from The Legend of Hell House (1973), The Exorcist (1973), Poltergeist (1982), The Shining (1980), Hollow Man (2000) to Hannibal (2001) & it spoofs all other sorts of film from various genres like Charlies Angels (2000), Harry Potter, Mission: Impossible II (2000), Rocky (1976) & Dirty Harry (1971) to name but a few. I must admit I had a great time trying to spot them all & I'm sure any film buff would, although I doubt many film buffs would agree with the way Scary Movie 2 treats these classic films. There are also some swipes at a few topical issues that were prevalent back then like the Bill Clinton 'affair'. At only 85 odd minutes long Scary Movie 2 moves along like a rocket with a constant stream of bad taste & gross out gags that I just found really funny, I haven't laughed so much during a film for ages, I don't really know what that says about me & frankly I don't care either.Director Wayans keeps the humour coming thick & fast, he seems to want cater for the lowest common denominator with a succession of gross bad taste gags from toilet humour, poo, fart, puke, spunk, sex, masturbation, drugs, paedophile priests, racism, sexism, gay jokes, a ghost helping himself to a blow-job in a pretty female students mouth, plenty of foul language including a funny Budgie & even the disabled aren't safe as Scary Movie 2 is one of the most politically incorrect films I've ever seen. There are plenty of jokes in Scary Movie 2 that I would imagine many would find offencive which is fine I suppose but I will openly say right now that I found the disabled jokes funny, the racist humour amusing & all the bad taste gags hilarious & frankly I have no problem saying that although I would imagine many would. It doesn't make me a racist or look down on those with disability, I think the whole world's gone political correctness mad anyway.With a supposed budget of $45,000,000 Scary Movie 2 very well made with great special effects & loving recreation of various classic scenes from films. The acting was good & everyone played their parts really well whether they were serious or campy & that Anna Faris is really rather hot.I loved Scary Movie 2, I found it hilarious, it's as simple & straight forward as that. In a world that's gone mad with political correctness Scary Movie 2 isn't afraid to poke fun at just about anything & seems to have no boundaries, I really can't remember laughing so much during a film, I really can't. If your prudish or easily offended then avoid Scary Movie 2 like the plague but if you like crude juvenile gross out humour then it's an absolute must see!",9,2,7,9 April 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Didn't do much for me at all.
","El Laberinto del Fauno is set in Spain in 1944 during the Civil War, a widow named Carmen (Ariadna Gil) marries Captain Vidal (Sergi López) the sadistic ruler of a group of Nationalist soldiers. Carmen & her 11 year old daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) move out to an old Mill in the countryside where Captain Vidal & his men are stationed trying to crush local rebel resistance. There Ofelia is lured into an ancient stone labyrinth by a fairy & down some steps into a magical fantasy realm, there she meets a creature called a Faun (Doug Jones) who says she was once the Princess of the magical realm & gives her three task's so she can reclaim her rightful place once again...This American, Spanish & Mexican co-production was written, produced & directed by Guillermo del Toro & after winning innumerable awards, accolades & critical acclaim I was expecting something a bit special which unfortunately wasn't forthcoming. Known more commonly under the title of Pan's Labyrinth in English speaking territories all the hype & advance publicity surrounding El Laberinto del Fauno stated that it was one of the best fantasy films of all time & like a fool I brought into it. The script by Toro is much, much more of a war time drama as it spends the vast majority of it's duration on the frankly depressing real life conflict between Spanish soldiers & rebels. In fact El Laberinto del Fauno is more of a drama than anything else, the quaint & sometimes charming fantasy elements are few & far between with only three or four notable sequences. When it focuses on Ofelia's fantasy world then it's often spellbinding but when it switches to the war time dramas it's horrible. When I watch a film I want to be entertained, nothing more nothing less. Watching El Laberinto del Fauno I was throughly depressed, it's hardly an uplifting tale & one that left me rather down. That's not what I want to feel like when watching a film, I'm sorry buts that the way it is. Some moments are genuinely unsettling & even upsetting to the extent that I sometimes found it quite hard to watch. The script leaves a lot of things open to the viewers interpretation but I thought it was pretty clear, the fantasy elements never really gel with the grim war time dramatics & the two make for uneasy bedfellows.Director Toro does a great job although I must admit I don't quite get what he was trying to do here. It's a tale of a girls imagination & hope but in the end he seems to want to crush any hope of any uplifting message in favour of some truly horrible moments of real life brutality, violence, torture & death. Some of the scenes in El Laberinto del Fauno are very disturbing, from people beaten to death, tortured, sliced open mouths & lots of bad things happening to good people. Presented entirely in Spanish with English subtitles I don't know about anyone else but while I'm reading the subtitles I can't get a good look at what's happening on screen, it's impossible, very frustrating & annoying. The special effects are pretty good, some of the CGI effects are a little below par I suppose but the make-up effects & creature design is very good. I wouldn't say El Laberinto del Fauno is scary but some of the character's do some really horrific things.Technically the film is very good, actually shot in Spain the production values are great & it's well made. The acting is excellent which makes it all the more powerful, whether that's a good thing I am not sure.El Laberinto del Fauno is a film lots of people seem to like for reasons which escape me, I thought it was a throughly depressing & disheartening experience that I have no desire to revisit. It has it's moments on occasion & it's often quite powerful stuff but that doesn't mean it makes good entertainment which I happen to think it isn't.",5,15,30,14 April 2008
Final Destination 2," Great sequel.
","Final Destination 2 starts as Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) & three of her friends set off for Denver, while on the highway Kimberly foresees an accident in which she, her friends & several other people die. Kimberly is shook up by the vision & refuses to carry on, as she is spoken to by officer Thomas Burke (Michael Landes) on the side of the road the huge accident she foresaw happens. She is saved although her friends still get killed while several other people who were supposed to die in the accident are also prevented from death by being held up behind Kimberly's car. Everyone just assumes that they were extremely lucky & that's that, but later that day Evan Lewis (David Paetkau) who was supposed to die in the highway pile-up is killed in a freak accident. Kimberly starts to have more visions as she foresees the death's of the people she saved, the people who were supposed to die & the people who seemingly cheated death. But death won't be cheated & if your time is up, your time is up...Directed by David R. Ellis I thought Final Destination 2 was a throughly entertaining film & a worthy sequel. The script by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress does what every good sequel should, it takes the original premise, elaborates on it, makes everything more spectacular & cranks things up a notch while being a fine film in it's own right. The basic Final Destination (2000) story is here, in fact in some ways you could call it as much a remake as a sequel as the two films are virtually the same but I found it great to watch as things get off to a spectacular start with a terrific highway pile-up & then the rest of the film as death catches up with the protagonists, I liked the way the accidents happen & the intricate build-ups to them with all manner of coincidences that lead to the unfortunate victims demise. Having said that things do turn a little silly at the end as it becomes too supernatural with things moving on their own, doors being jammed & these scenes felt too deliberate & not down to random chance or coincidence. There are some clever references to the original, the character's are good & pretty likable & as a whole I thought it was a throughly entertaining & watchable film that moves along at a great pace.Director Ellis does a great job & he builds the tension up in the run up to the kills very effectively. There are plenty of other fun film references including some of he character's being named after various horror directors. The kills are cool & quite graphic, the pile-up has someone lose their head via a huge log, someone is squashed to a bloody pulp, there's a decapitation, someone gets a spike through their head, someone is sliced up by barb wire, someone gets a ladder impaled in their eye & there's a pleasing amount of blood. The special effects are very good with the initial pile-up being particularly impressive.With a supposed budget of about $26,000,000 Final Destination 2 is extremely well made & has that Hollywood polish about it. The acting is OK & a special mention goes to Keegan Connor Tracy as Kat whom I rather fancied...Final Destination 2 is a top film that I enjoyed immensely & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Definitely recommend, another sequel Final Destination 3 (2006) has been made.",8,3,4,20 January 2007
Blade II," Top comic book sequel to a top film.
","Blade II starts as the half Vampire half human Vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes) continues his 2 year long quest to find his friend Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) whom the Vampire race have held captive for that time after the events in the original Blade (1998), Blade finally has tracked him down & frees him. One night back at his base a group of highly trained Vampires known as the 'Bloodpack' infiltrate it & they deliver a message to Blade that the Vampire king Eli Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) wants a truce between the two warring sides, Blade agrees & the Bloodpack takes him to their headquarters to speak with Damaskinos personally who wants Blade to help him & his race exterminate a new breed of Vampire known as a Reaper. This new type of Vampire needs to feed on fresh blood every few hours & preferably Vampire blood but once they have wiped the Vampie race out they will turn their attention to the human race, they are immune to silver & garlic & infect their prey with a virus that turns them into Reapers, in a matter of months the whole planet could be overrun with the things. It' up to Blade & the Bloodpack to destroy the source of the virus, the original carrier named Jared Nomak (Luke Goss) before it's too late...This American German co-production was directed by Guillermo del Toro & is the second outing for the popular comic book character Blade, personally I think the original Blade is complete class & I was slightly worried by this sequel as I thought that it would be a huge disappointment but I'm happy to report that Blade II is almost as good as the original which was more than a little bit surprising. Anyway, David S. Goyer returns to pen the sequel & he does a fine job again as this time around he has more scope & money to play with as he makes everything that little bit bigger, louder & more ambitious. The film moves along like a rocket yet still manages to have a good story which has more to it than you may expect, the character's are good & the uneasy truce between Blade & the Vampires is well used & is always there as an undercurrent, there are a few twists & turns as people aren't quite what they first seem & things aren't quite as straight forward as they seem, there are also some neat ideas here particularly the Reapers themselves whose jaws split apart to reveal snake like tongues. I liked the ending which isn't the usual Hollywood 'happily ever after' type thing & the script also does a good job of making the main villain Jared quite a sympathetic character who in essence is just a victim of his circumstances although deliciously evil at the same time. Overall I was very impressed with Blade II.Director Toro does a great job & while I can say this has a decent script with better character's & narrative than your average Hollywood no-brainer Blade II just wouldn't be any good if it were not for it's gore, violence, fights, chases, monsters, glamorous sleek chrome plated weaponry of various descriptions & it's cool attitude. Blade II has a fantastic look about it with great production design, it seems to alternate between dark run down decrepit sewers & back alleys to ultra sleek, modern & shiny scientific labs & complexes & it's a perfect mix & Toro manages to get the blend just about perfect, visually Blade II is top-notch. The weapons are suitably over-the-top & used to good violent effect throughout with the fights & action scenes extremely well choreographed & actually pretty exciting, the costumes are cool too with Leanor Varela standing out in her skin tight leather outfit at the end. There's plenty of blood & gore here, there's loads of the red stuff splashed around, there's plenty of disintegrating Vampires, people sliced in half, someone has the top of their head cut off, someone is blown up & there's a yucky autopsy scene. The body count in this must be pretty damned high.With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Blade II looks the absolute business & has that sleek ultra well made Hollywood polish to it with great cinematography, top special effects, the usual catchy techno music to accompany the numerous set-pieces & excellent production values. The acting is decent enough, Snipes as Blade is suitably emotionless & delivers the one-liners with the appropriate enthusiasm. Kristofferson puts in a good shift while Ron Perlman equally so, ex-boy band singer Luke Goss is an unexpected choice for but rather impressive bad guy, Varela makes for a nice looking love interest & Norman Reedus is good & pretty likable as Scud.Blade II is an absolute top action horror hybrid big budget popcorn film that's a very worthy sequel, it's as simple & straight forward as that. Make sure you watch it as soon as you can, followed by Blade: Trinity (2004) & Blade: The Series (2006) stars someone called Sticky Fingaz...",8,0,1,29 January 2007
Alien," The Sci-Fi horror film that set the standard all others have to match.
","Alien starts with the seven crew-members of the huge commercial spaceship the Nostromo being awoken from their sleep. It quickly turns out that the ship's computer named Mother has received a 'transmission of unknown origin' & has woken everyone to investigate. The crew set off in a smaller craft to the planet where the transmission is being sent from, once there Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Kane (John Hurt) & Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) don their spacesuits & go to track the source of the transmission down. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) & the chief science officer Ash (Ian Holm) stay behind & co-ordinate things. Dallas, Kane & Lambert discover an alien ship & inside Kane is lowered into a huge chamber full of eggs one of which opens & a creature attachés itself to his face. Back on board the Nostromo Kane is given medical treatment but the creature cannot be removed & it has acid for blood. Eventually the creature seems to come off by itself & Kane regains consciousness & appears fine. However while eating dinner Kane has a fit as an alien creature bursts out of his chest. The crew decide they must arm themselves & the two engineers Parker (Yaphet Kotto) & Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) manage to come up with some basic weapons, they all quickly discover this alien has grown to an enormous size & is very hostile...Directed by Ridley Scott Alien really is just about the best of it's type, period. The script by Dan O'Bannon is a little slow to get going by todays standards but I felt this build up is essential as Scott piles on the tension, isolation & mistrust among the crew before they are systematically hunted down by a seemingly invincible killing machine that is the alien. You feel for the characters of which there are only seven during the whole film which makes what happens even more effective. While the pace may be measured Alien is never boring & it provides terrific scary entertainment, even after all this time I think it still manages to be creepy, frightening & very effective at what it sets out to do. Technically Alien is top-notch, a lot of the special effects hold up very well even today next to all the flashy soulless CGI that fill films up. Obviously a few are a little unconvincing but I can easily forgive this, I mean it was made over 25 years ago wasn't it? The production design is great as well, Alien doesn't depict it's spacecraft as sterile white & perfectly clean but as something far more realistic, all the dirt, grime & grated floors that look like a mining ship would. Having said that some of the computer equipment looks a little dated even now which along with the slightly slow pace is my only real complaint. The alien itself was designed by H.R. Giger & looks very impressive, very organic & menacing even though it isn't seen that much it's definitely one of the most memorable of all on screen aliens. Director Scott also manages to use sound & music to good effect, I found Alien quite a quiet film which works well. There isn't much in the way of blood or gore, just that alien bursting out of Hurt's chest. The acting is great from all involved & director Scott manages to retain an air of mystery about who will survive as he gives no obvious indication of a hero type character. Alien is a true classic, the chest-burster scene will live on forever & it's a film everyone should see at least once. Watch it as soon as you can.",9,4,10,31 July 2005
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Entertaining adaptation of the musical.
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street starts as wrongly convicted escaped penal colony prisoner Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) arrives back home in London 15 years after he was imprisoned at the behest of the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) leaving behind a beautiful wife & a young daughter named Johanna for the lecherous old Judge to prey on. Barker heads back to where he used to live & finds Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) running a meat pie shop, she claims his wife committed suicide & the Judge now keeps Johanna (Jayne Wisener) imprisoned in his house. Changing his name from Barker to Sweeney Todd to hide his real identity he sets up a barber's above the meat pie shop where he plots his gruesome revenge...This British American co-production was directed by Tim Burton & is a gory Gothic & darkly morbid film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical as opposed to a straight adaptation of the infamous story which has been around since the 19th Century, apparently. The musical adaptation was by Christopher Bond while the films screenplay is credited to John Logan, I will admit right here & now that I haven't seen Sondheim's musical this is based on so I have no idea if it's faithful but by all accounts there are several songs missing from this & it goes without saying that this film version has far more flexibility in what it shows than a live stage musical ever could. I liked the story, I liked the setting, I liked the character's & for the most part I liked the songs too but I did think the first half was a little slow at times. It's fair to say right now a few weeks after Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street opened it has reached #189 in the IMDb's 'Top 250' films list although I doubt very much that it will stay there especially when it comes out on home video. This is a hard film to call & recommend, apart from some isolated sequences with dialogue the entire film is sang & that in itself may put many off, it can look a bit strange at times & I must admit that I did start & get a little bored with it as the entire first half of the film is song after song with very little incident. Once the killings & gore start the films picks up immeasurably but that's probably down to the fact that I love horror films & gory horror films at that so one could argue that my liking for such things carried me through. If you don't like musicals where everyone bursts into song every few seconds & you don't like blood drenched darkly Gothic horror films then Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is your worst nightmare come true. This really is down to personal taste, if you have no interest in musicals or gore then give it a miss since I think it's a very acquired taste.Director Burton knows how to turn in a visually interesting & stylish film with Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street no exception, there's some wonderful camera shots & plenty of little visual gags & clever touches. It's certainly a great & often ghoulish film to sit down & watch. The sets are superb, they really give you a feel of the run down rat infested back streets of Victorian (modern?!) London & are totally convincing. Large parts of the film are gore free but once the blood flows there's plenty on show with some of the coolest slit throats out there, huge spurts of crimson red blood look great as do the various minced up bodies & mutilated human remains seen at the end of the film. Talking of the end it's all rather morbid & downbeat, personally I thought it was an appropriate & fitting way to round the film off but just don't expect a Grease (1978) style happy ending! Over here in the UK the trailers that have run on TV have all been dialogue based & make no indication that Sweeney Todd: The Barber of Fleet Street is 95% musical, I could certainly see people mislead by the trailers into thinking they were going to see a Tim Burton Gothic horror gore-fest rather than a sprightly musical which I think is rather naughty...With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is superbly made with exquisite production values, the sets look gorgeous although Burton tends to bleach a lot of the colour out of the shot & at times it's not far from being black and white. Actually shot here in the UK this certainly looks very nice. The acting is alright, the singing is alright & I have no major problems with either although I doubt anyone will be singing any of the songs on show here to themselves on the way home & the heavy cockney accents might put some off.Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is an acquired taste for sure, I'm positive it won't stay in the IMDb Top 250 for very long & I don't really think it deserves to be there now. This one really is down to personal tastes, bear in mind that it's a musical & that it's quite bloody & if it still appeals to you then your more than likely going to enjoy it.",7,0,3,5 February 2008
Underworld Awakening," Stylish & cool but empty & soulless.
","Underworld: Awakening starts as the existence of Vampires & Lycans living amongst humanity has been exposed, the authorities respond by carrying out a mass purge in order to wipe out both the Vampire & Lycan species. Vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) & her hybrid lover Michael Corvin attempt to escape the mass execution & meet at a dock but both are shot & fall into the water, Selene wakes up twelve years later in the labs of a company called Antigen after being placed in cryogenic suspension. Selene manages to escape Antigen & meets another Vampire named David (Theo James) & a young hybrid girl named Eve (India Eisley) who are all attacked by Lycans but manage to reach the relative safety of a secret community of Vampires hiding on the outskirts of the city, Selene quickly realises that Eve is her daughter & that she is crucial to genetic Lycan experiments that will give them invulnerability & will stop at nothing to get her back. Selene must fight the Lycan threat, save Eve, herself & humanity from the vicious Lycans...Directed by the Sweedish duo of Måns Mårlind & Björn Stein this is the fourth film in the franchise that started with Underworld (2003) & was followed by the direct sequel Underworld: Evolution (2006) which happens to be my favourite Underworld film (hey, I have it on Blu-ray...) after which came Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009) which was a prequel & didn't feature Kate Beckinsale as Selene. For Underworld: Awakening the script jumps back to contemporary times in a modern almost futuristic city & Kate Beckinsale returns as the sexy rubber clad Vampire Selene, I must admit to liking the Underworld series as each film is visually good with some good action & gore set-pieces & although the mythology isn't exactly deep a world of Vampires & Werewolf monsters fighting each other provides ample opportunity for various cool action scenes, huge monsters, plenty of violence & gore &, of course, Kate Beckinsale in tight black PVC & rubber kicking ass. Hey, what can I say? I am easily pleased. The major disappointment about Underworld: Awakening is the lack of any substantial story on which to hang the set-pieces & action, the script is really simplistic with none of the character's standing out or being developed beyond broad clichés (character's who want to fight, character's who want don't, an evil scientist) & the plot feels a little bit choppy with the beginning in particular feeling like it could have been expanded & explained a little better. The plot about genetic experiments & Selene having to save her daughter is standard fantasy film stuff & even the concept of the Vampire & Lycan war exposed to humanity is nothing special or that original although I suppose it will take the series in a different direction if any further sequels materialize. Underwolrd: Awakenings is also very short, if you ignore the closing credits (which last for ten minutes!) then the films runs for a mere 75 minutes, I think the film could have used an extra five or ten minutes worth of character & plot development to flesh things out a little actually so it doesn't quite feels as soulless as it does & we then might have actually cared about the people here & what was going on a bit more. The twist at the end & the revelation of what the evil Lycans are trying to do is strictly routine & raises minimal interest & things are predictably left open ended to facilitate a further sequel.Filmed & released in 3-D which is a trend doing the rounds in Hollywood at the moment I cannot comment on this version, I have eye problems that prevent me from seeing films in 3-D so I don't know how it looks but even I could see several scenes shot in a way with 3-D in mind. Visually I love the way Underworld: Awakening looks, it's dark grey & blue colours & it's modern yet Gothic looking sets that are impressive to look at & add lots of character to the film. The fight scenes are good, there's plenty of slow motion, shoot-outs, fights, all sorts of flips & somersault's while the CGI computer effects are also generally very good. There's a really good scene in which Selene, David & Eve are trying to escape some Lycans while driving a van & the Lycans chase them through the city traffic. There's lots of violence & gore on show, from slit throats to broken arms to ripped-out throats to exploding Werewolves to slashed wrists & chopped off heads. If your looking for blood then Underworld: Awakening delivers.With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 this was filmed in British Columbia in Canada, the production values are great & the film is visually impressive even if it does feel empty in terms of it's story. The acting is alright, British names such as Stephen Rea & Charles Dance provide decent support although it's the sexy Beckinsale in tight black rubber that steals the show.Underworld: Awakening carries on the visual look of the series & sees the return of Selene but it feels empty with the minimum of story to hold the action & gore together. I liked it enough & I would watch it again for the visuals, the action & the gore but it has no depth.",5,6,8,4 March 2012
Corpse Bride," Wonderful dark stop-motion animated fairy tale.
","Corpse Bride is set in a 19th Century European village where Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) the son of local fishmongers is to be married off to Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) the daughter of the penniless Maudeline (Joanna Lumley) & Finis (Albert Finney), as an arranged marriage for the benefit of the parents neither Victor or Victoria have even met each other before but when they do they fall in love for real. During a wedding rehearsal Victor keeps messing his lines up & takes a walk in nearby woods to practice his lines when he accidentally marries himself to the corpse of Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) who comes to life & insists that she & Victor are now married & takes him to the underworld where the dead hang out. Victor wants to get back to the land of the living & marry Victoria but his new Corpse Bride won't let him get away so easily...This American British co-production was directed by Tim Burton & Mike Johnson & is a simply wonderful fantasy with gorgeous visuals & beautiful stop-motion animation, having brought it on Blu-Ray & watched it yesterday Corpse Bride is easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Corpse Bride is an enchanting dark fairy tale about a twisted love triangle as Victor has two women fighting over him, one dead & one alive. It's amazing how much the character's come across, how much personality & how charming they are. Corpse Bride is also surprisingly moving with a rather bitter sweet ending that is genuinely sad & emotional. At only 77 minutes the pace is great, the film is full of memorable moments like the funny part when the skeleton's jaw drops off at the end or the touching scene between Victoria & Victor together playing a piano, there's three fun song & dance numbers although the majority of the film is spoken dialogue. With a simple yet clear & engaging plot full of great moments Corpse Bride is a unique work of art as well as a fantastic film that I thought was excellent in every way & can't recommend it enough.Obviously a labour of love for many Corpse Bride looks fabulous, with it's beautifully designed sets & puppets this is a visual treat. The character's are all thin Insect stick like or fat, squat & barrel shaped & the whole film is simply gorgeous to look at. The sets are great too, from the dull & grey land of the living to the colourful land of the dead which is much more vibrant as the dead no longer have to conform to the rigid constraints of the living. The detail is also amazing with the smallest thing given utmost attention, Corpse Bride is the sort of film you watch several times & notice new things each time. The Blu-Ray I brought has several brief featurettes which are not in depth enough with none of them lasting more than nine minutes but you do get the idea behind the amount of effort that was put into Corpse Bride, from the sets to the puppets themselves which have clockwork gears inside them to control facial features & stance. Apparently Corpse Bride was shot with a digital still camera rather than a proper film camera & the individual frames were edited together. With a 55 week shooting schedule just to film the animation & not including pre or post production Corpse Bride was over a year in the making & it show's.With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 a lot of time, effort & money was spent on Corpse Bride & the finished product was worth it, I also recently saw another similar film Coraline (2009) which is also beautifully animated & it's shame both films underperformed at the box-office. There's some great voice actors here, Depp, Watson, Carter, Christopher Lee, Richard E. Grant & Michael Gough all have parts.Corpse Bride is a fantastic film that I loved & has now become a personal favourite of mine, from the beautiful animation & character's to the enchanting story of twisted love, I liked it & can't think of anything negative to say about it.",8,2,2,24 April 2010
"Monsters, Inc."," 'Today is bring an obscure relative to work day.' Just about flawless animated comedy fantasy.
","Monsters, Inc. starts like any other day in Monstropolis for monster friends & work colleagues Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) & James 'Sulley' Sullivan (John Goodman), together they work or Monstrs Inc. the company who supply all the power for Monstroplolis by bottling children's screams. Sulley is a top scarer who enters kids rooms through their closets & scares them so they will scream & Mike is his faithful assistant, however there is a power shortage & kids these days just don't scare easily. Late one night while sorting some paperwork out Sulley comes across a young child on the shop-floor, a shocking sight as great care is taken to make sure the kids never enter Monstropolis as the slightest of touches from just one child may be enough to kill a monster. Sulley has to hide the child from the authorities & find a way to get her back to her own room, however he discovers a sinister plot to kidnap lots of children from their bedrooms in an attempt to solve the energy crisis...Directed by Pete Docter, David Silverman & Lee Unkrich I personally think Monsters, Inc. is the greatest computer animated film I've ever seen & a film that I have great fondness for. The script by Andrew Stanton & Dan Gerson moves along seamlessly & has the perfect mix of humour, action & sentimentality. I loved the relationship between Sulley & little Boo as you can see him warming to her, surely this has to be one of the cutest & most likable on screen pairings ever, I think you would have to have a very cold heart not to feel a little bit of sadness at the end when Sulley has to say goodbye to Boo for the last time. They are also surrounded by some truly wonderful character's & friends, from the extremely funny Mike to his girlfriend Celia, from the slimy bad guy Randall & the adorable Abominable Snowman. I'm not a child, I'm not a teenager & by all counts the people around me keep saying I'm an adult but does that mean I can't enjoy a wonderful film such as this? Why do kids have all the fun? Quite frankly there is nothing that I don't like about this film, Monsters, Inc. is pure lovable brilliance from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that.The director's do a great job, they fill just about every inch of the screen with fantastic detail & visual delights. There is so much going on in both the foreground, background & corners of the frame, for instance I loved the scene when the blob creature slid over the grate & accidentally oozed down into it plus Celia's individual snake hairdo whom all have personalities of their own & loads more besides. The character designs are the perfect blend between cuteness & sliminess, this being a Disney film everyone is big & cuddly but they have a weird gooey multiple eyes & tentacles everywhere look to them as well. It's obvious that a lot of time & effort went into the production of Monsters, Inc. including the fact that it normally took 11 to 12 hours to render a single fame of Sulley because they animated each of his 2.3 million hair strands individually! You know that literally boggles my mind just thinking about it.I can't quite believe that Monsters, Inc. had a budget of about $115,000,000, I love the film to bits but all that money?! Every frame is beautifully rendered & animated but why so much? Anyway, the film is an absolute delight to watch & for that sort of cash it should be. Nominated for & won lots of awards including winning an Oscar for Best Music & it lost out to Shrek (2001) on the Best Animated Feature which I am not having at all, Monsters, Inc. beats Shrek hands down as far as I'm concerned, there is no justice. The voice actors add so much to the film, Crystal & Goodman are perfect as are Steve Buscemi & the imposing sounding James Coburn as the villains, Jennifer Tilly makes for a squeaky & cute sounding love interest.Monsters, Inc. is just about faultless as far as I'm concerned & hopefully it will appeal to the child in most adults while I'm positive any child will enjoy it immensely. It's totally brilliant in every way, there's nothing else to say. More than deserves it's place on the IMDb Top 250 films list. Watch it as soon as you can, that's an order not a request.",9,0,1,25 December 2006
Predator," 'Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here, this stuff 'll make you a god damn sexual Tyranosaurus. Just like me!' Arnie, aliens and big explosions, what more do you want?
","Predator opens to a shot of space. An alien craft shoots past Earth and jettisons something which enters our atmosphere. Major 'Dutch' Schaeffer (Arnold Swarzenegger) and his team of five men, Mac (Bill Duke), Blain (Jesse Ventura), Billy (Sonny Landham), Poncho (Richard Chaves) and Hawkins (Shane Black) arrive near a Central American jungle and are briefed by General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) and one of Dutch's old friends George Dillon (Carl Weathers). Dutch is told that two important cabinet ministers were taken hostage deep in the jungle when their helicopter was shot down by rebels and it's up to Dutch and his men to bring them back. Dillon says he will be going along as well. Once in the jungle they discover the helicopter which looks like it was shot down using heat seeking missiles. Soon after they also find another American soldier, Jim Harper hanging upside down from a branch and totally skinned, ouch. The men find the rebels camp. Dutch witnesses one of the hostages (Steve Boyum) being executed. The unit storm the camp, kill all the enemy soldiers and blow lots of things up. They find the other hostage dead too. They also come across Anna (Elpidia Carrllo) who Dillon insists he wants to take back and interrogate. Dutch finds out that Dillon lied and it was never meant to be a rescue mission but an assassination which causes hostilities between the two. They radio in and ask for an air lift but are told that they can't send a chopper that far into the jungle as the area is still too hot for a pick-up. They must track across miles of jungle to a safe rendezvous point. While making their way to the pick-up point Anna tries to escape and runs into the jungle, Hawkins is sent after her and he is killed by something which seems able to camouflage itself against the trees. Soon after Blain is killed by whatever it is. Dutch quickly comes to the conclusion that this isn't mere human enemy soldiers but something else, something much more deadly and brutal, something that maybe doesn't even belong on Earth and something with a primal and basic motive for hunting them, sport! But will Dutch be able to turn the tables on the ultimate predator (Kevin Peter Hall is the man in the monster suit) and lead his surviving men to safety? Directed by John McTiernan I thought this was a cracking piece of big-budget Hollywood entertainment. The script by Jim and John Thomas moves like a rocket and it never becomes boring or dull. It mixes action, horror and sci-fi very well. It is a little silly at times and some of the macho stuff is a bit corny. The one-liners are there too, the infamous 'knock knock' after Arnie kicks a door in and blows an enemy through a wall and 'stick around' after Arnie impales someone with his machete are stand outs. Only occasionally did I remember that I was watching a Hollywood product, the 'happy' Arnie gets the girl ending especially. There is only one big action scene and that's where Dutch and his team wipe out an entire enemy camp, it's a fun sequence with lots of gunfire and big explosions. And that mini-gun Jesse Ventura carries around blowing people away with is the coolest, meanest and sexiest looking gun in film history! (it was so cool Arnie had to have one of his own a few years later when he made Terminator 2) There are, rather surprisingly it has to be said, some very gory moments, skinned corpses, someone has their brains splattered over the camera lens, someones chest is blown open, a severed arm on the ground still firing it's weapon, a pile of guts on the ground and the predator rips someones spinal column and skull out. The special make-up effects generally speaking are excellent, as are the predator effects by Stan Winston. It's obviously a man in a monster suit, but hey what a cool monster suit it is! One thing that did annoy me is when the film switched to a point-of-view shot from the predator itself, it's sight is based on thermal imaging and the effect really got on my nerves after a while, don't know why really it just did. It's well made with nice production values and a special mention goes to the music by Alan Silvestri which I thought was appropriate and excellent. The acting is OK, but the cast is great with Arnie, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and Carl Weathers making it fun to watch. I really liked this and throughly recommend it, along with Terminator 1 (1984) & 2 (1991) this is easily Arnies best film. This is probably on T.V. all the time and is widely available on a special edition DVD so there is no excuse for letting this cracker of an action/horror film pass you by. Watch it now!",8,3,8,4 February 2005
28 Weeks Later," Disappointing sequel, I preferred the original to be honest.
","28 Weeks Later... is set in a decimated London & starts as all the infected created by the rage virus have died of starvation, a US led Nato group has set up an area in London to start the re-population of England. Don (Robert Carlyle) survived the virus & is reunited with his two children Tammy (Imogen Poots) & Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) whom he tells the bad news about their mother Alice (Catherine McCormack) being killed by one of the infected. Tammy & Andy break out of the quarantined living area & into a deserted London where they hope to go to their old house which they do, once there they find their supposedly dead mum hiding in a bedroom. They are all taken back & Alice is examined by a military scientist named Scarlet (Rose Byrne) who makes the shocking discovery that Alice is infected with the virus but somehow has an immunity to it, unfortunately since the virus is present in her blood Alice is also a carrier of the virus & it's not long before there's another outbreak...This British production was co-written & directed Juan Carlos Fresnadillo & is a disappointing follow up to the original 28 Days Later... (2002) in my opinion. The script by Fresnadillo, Rowan Joffe, Jesus Olmo & E.L. Lavigne starts off a bit too slowly for my liking, in fact the first 30 odd minutes of 28 Weeks Later... is nothing more than exposition about the aftermath of the outbreak & bringing the viewer up speed on the situation as it stands at present, this actually feels almost semi-documentary & news report like. Then, eventually, the action kicks in & it's pretty uninspired stuff to be honest. There's the usual small group of survivors who have to combat an evil menace, in this case the infected & it all seems rather routine & a tad dull. 28 Weeks Later... reminds heavily of Aliens (1986), there's the initial threat which has supposedly been eradicated, there's the gung-ho American military, there's the annoying brat of a kid & a complete stranger who sudden thinks they're the most important thing in the world & all sorts of unlikely coincidences & a fair helping of bad luck & stupidity which sets a chain of unfortunate events going including rounding the entire public population in a single room & only locking one door & not guarding them so when the infected arrive they can just walk right on in & have plenty of victims to choose from... Then there's the awful character's, the only likable one gets cooked while the kids really are annoying & since they were the ones who pretty much caused the entire situation in the first place I had absolutely no sympathy with them & I actually wanted them to die, horribly. The ironic ending where the good hearted scientist & soldier sacrifice their lives to get Andy & Tammy to safety even though they too carry the infection but show no symptom's like their mum which then spreads the virus even further is probably the most effective thing about the entire film. Having said that it's watchable on a certain level, the second half of the film does pick up & it moves along at a reasonable pace, if your undemanding then you may enjoy it but I personally didn't think it was anything special at all.Director Fresnadillo ruins the whole thing by filming it on grainy hand-held camcorders which shake about all over the place especially during the action scenes so it's sometimes difficult to see what's happening & that quickly becomes both annoying & frustrating. Then there's the quick fire 'blink and you'll miss it' editing which also makes it difficult to see what's happening, both the shaky camera & quick editing techniques have been used a fair bit recently in horror films & I personally hate both. Why can't people just make a proper film? The whole gritty, realistic documentary look irritates me & I don't know one single other person who likes this style. Forget about much gore, there's a fair amount of blood splatter, there's an eye gouging, some gory gunshot wounds & the films showstopper moment when a group of the infected are mowed down by helicopter blades but overall there's not much here if your looking for gore.Techncially the film is fine, there are some impressive expansive aerial shots of London & some of it's landmarks. It was nice to see the new Wembley make an appearance at the end, ironically when the first film 28 days Later... was made it hadn't been built yet! The acting was alright, no one going to win any awards & that young kid with the long girly hair just got on my nerves throughout. The always dependable Robert Carlyle is as watchable as ever though.28 Weeks Later... is an OK time waster although I expected & had hoped for more than that, overall I was disappointed by a largely dull, forgettable & ordinary film.",5,12,38,11 May 2007

Night Shyamalan this was his fourth major film after the success he had with The Sixth Sense (1999), Unbreakable (2000) & Signs (2002) all of which I rather like for their horror mystery aspects & killer twist endings which has sort of become his trademark, The Village is probably the last really good film he has made & while it will undoubtedly divide audiences I did like it overall. The film is fairly slow going at times but it does build up really well with a certain sense of dread & anticipation on the part of the viewer, the twist ending is good & it's one of those ones where everything sort of falls into place nicely & everything that has gone before makes sense in context. The character's are alright if a little cold at times, the dialogue is sparse but meaningful & I felt like I was rewarded for sticking with it & following it properly. The lack of any sort of action might put some off & disappoint other's but I think if you give it a chance it's a satisfying experience. The film tries to be quite deep with the likes of fate & sticking with what you believe touched upon. However The Village is not perfect & the biggest problem I had with it was that while the ending depicts a community set-up to shun modern society & it's horrors for a more simpler & wholesome life surely creating the village's entire existence on horrible killer monsters lurking in the woods around it who may kill anyone at any point doesn't seem that great of an existence either as surely everyone would be living in constant fear?The film looks great with impressive period detail & the cold naturalistic colour scheme suits the oppressive nature of the film, there's a lack of close-ups with plenty of shots where the camera is fixed & character's are quite far away with rams home the feel of isolation even more. There's some well crafted scenes like the fist attack on the village by the monsters & the scene where Lucius is stabbed as the scene starts out to innocuously but suddenly shifts into something much darker. There's very little horror here, there's no real gore or violence either. Originally called The Woods but there was another horror film called The Woods (2006) the same year so the title of this was changed to the Village.With a supposed budget of about $70 odd million this is very well made with big budget Hollywood production values, filmed mainly in Pennsylvania in a couple of large fields where an entire town was built & then taken down again after filming had finished. The acting is very good too from a decent cast none of whom really stand out but are believable including Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt & Brendan Gleeseon while Kirsten Dunst was replaced by Bryca Dallas Howard after she dropped out to make Elizabeth town (2005).The Village is a film that may not appeal to everyone & it being advertised as a straight horror doesn't help but if you are prepared to stick with it & follow it through then it is pretty rewarding with a twist that I liked & thought worked well.",6,1,5,28 November 2009
Pitch Black," Good sci-fi/horror film.
","Pitch Black starts sometime in the future somewhere deep in outer space where 40 commercial passengers are in cryo-sleep aboard a spacecraft waiting their destination. Unfortunately the spaceship is caught in a meteor storm which breaches the hull, after a bumpy ride Officer Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) manages to land what's left of the ship on the nearest planet. The only survivors are Fry herself, bounty hunter William Johns (Cole Hauser) & his bounty Riddick (Vin Diesel) along with religious Islamic nut Abu al-Walid (Keith David), intergalactic antiques dealer Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), Sharon Montgomery (Claudia Black), a guy called Zeke (John Moore) & some young boys including Jack (Rhianna Griffith). Together they must work to survive the chances of which improve dramatically when they discover an old abandoned settlement complete with spaceship, unfortunately it seems that the planet is infested with flesh eating creatures that can only survive in complete dark which is OK considering the planet has three suns. However by some amazing coincidence the day they happen to crash on this particular planet the first eclipse in 22 years that plunges the entire planet into total darkness occurs, now that's unlucky...This Australian American co-production was co-written & directed by David Twohy & I have to admit I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. The script by Twohy along with Ken & Jim Wheat is surprisingly good & intelligent, at it's heart Pitch Black is an Alien (1979) clone but it's certainly one of the best. The character's make this film what it is, they are very well written, there aren't any real clichés among them, they all have an edge to them & unbelievably I actually cared for these people. Because there are no major a-list actors in Pitch Black it make the who's going to die & who isn't question a lot harder to call. The film starts off a little slowly but once it reaches the 40 odd minute mark & the flying creatures are let loose it never lets up, although having said that the first 40 odd minutes are used well to set both the character's & situation up so when the creature do start to attack it actually means something. I'm sure many other's have questioned this but why would an animal such as the one in Pitch Black evolve which can be hurt by light when the planet it's living on has three suns & has an eclipse every 22 years? Also what would these things feed on since the planet is pretty much dead? Don't give me that cannibalism rubbish either, I mean eventually they would all eat each other & there would theoretically only be one left who would eventually die of starvation anyway.Director Twohy does a good job, there are no massive CGI effect scenes & he instead keeps things quite low-key & understated. The special effects that are here though are excellent & the scenes of the suns going behind the large ringed planet are cool. I'm not sure about the bleached colour in a lot of shots but at least it creates a pretty good alien environment & atmosphere. The film is lacking in gore, there is a rotten skeleton, a severed foot, someone injects a needle into their eye & someone has there head bitten off but that's about as nasty as it gets.Apparently shot in 60 days on a budget of about $23,000,000 Pitch Black is well made with that Hollywood polish to it. The acting was pretty good from a mostly unknown cast although Vin Diesel has gone on to be a major Hollywood star & I have to say I thought he was great in this & played his part brilliantly with great menace.Pitch Black is a great sci-fi/horror film & better than I had expected. In 20 odd years time I don't think anyone will look back on Pitch Black with the same regard as we do with Aien now but it's good solid entertainment that gets the job done. Well worth a watch. Followed by The Chronicles of Riddick (2004) & the straight-to-video animated film The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury (2004).",7,1,3,31 October 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Excellent horror film remake, much better than the original.
","The Hills Have Eyes tells the tale of Big Bob Carter (Ted Levine) & his wife Ethel (Kathleen Quinlan) who are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary by driving from Cleveland to San Diego with their family, including their son Bobby (Dan Byrd) along with their two daughters Brenda (Emilie de Ravin) & Lynn (Vinessa Shaw) plus her husband Doug (Aaron Stanford) & their baby daughter Catherine (Maisie Camilleri Preziosi) all couped up together in one 4x4 & a trailer in the 100 plus degree heat of the New Mexico desert miles from civilisation. They stop off at a gas station where they fill up & are given bogus directions by the attendant (Tom Bower) which leads them even further from civilisation, however that's not all they have to contend with as deliberately set spikes on the road puncture the tyres on their car which causes them to crash. At first everyone is annoyed as they are miles from anywhere & nobody can get a mobile signal but Bob says he can walk back to the gas station & get help so it's no major problem, that is until a gang of mutant cannibals turn up looking for their next meal...Co-written & directed by Alexandre Aja I thought this remake was absolutely top class & enjoyed it infinitely more than the dull & drab original Hills Have Eyes (1977). I think I am right in saying that there are two versions of The Hills Have Eyes readily available, the cut 'R' rated one & an 'Unrated' one, I will be basing my comment on the uncut edit (the only one available here in the UK anyway). The script by Aja & Gregory Levasseur is slow going for the first half but still manages to retain ones interest with decent character's & a good opening massacre along with the suspicion that it will explode into life at any moment & boy does it. Once it gets going there's no stopping it, there's loads of gory violence, some nasty exploitation including pointing a magnum at a baby & an unpleasant rape scene you don't usually expect from Hollywood, some nice ideas that distances itself from the original but not greatly & it makes for a terrific blood-soaked, mutant filled, special effect leaden twisted quality piece of film-making! The first half plays almost the same as the original as it introduces exactly the same character's from the original while it takes a few twists & turns later on with the introduction of a town & the mutants origins but it doesn't muck around with the basic story of survival at all costs that the original was all about. A top notch horror film & one well worth watching.Director Aja does a great job, the desert locations are magnificent with some really striking jagged rock formations & some just plain cool landscape shots. The feel of isolation is definitely there & Aja keeps on reminding us of it, it has a great atmosphere, it has some great action & gory set-pieces & it has a underlying tension to it. Now onto the violence & gore, while it's not packed with the stuff what's here is cool, there are pick axes in eyes, axes in heads, severed body parts galore, burnt corpses, someone commits suicide by literally blowing their head off with a shotgun, fingers are severed, people have their brains shot out, there's gutted dogs, someone has their throat torn out, impalings, spikes through throats, the family's pet bird has it's head bitten off & there's even a bit of cannibalism in there all of which comes accompanied with plenty of he red stuff splattered all over the place. The special effects on the kills & the mutant killer's are excellent.With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 The Hills Have Eyes is technically brilliant, the production design, the special effects, the locations, the fights, the stunts, camera-work & music are all as good as one would hope. It was actually shot in the stunning deserts of Morocco. The acting is fine from everyone with the actors playing the mutants doing a particularly good job under all that latex, foam, rubber & fake blood. Even Billy Drago makes an appearance & he gets to eat a human heart...The Hills Have Eyes is a top remake that easily surpasses the original in my opinion. There's not a lot of love around for the majority of classic horror remakes but this along with the equally brilliant The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) remake means many may have to start & think again. I was throughly impressed, definitely recommend & worth watching (even on Christmas Eve!).",8,2,14,24 December 2006
American Psycho," 'I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.' Didn't do much for me.
","American Psycho is set in New York where Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) the Vice President of a Wall Street banking firm enjoys a hugely successful life with a beautiful apartment, loads of money, the best clothes, the finest food & all the luxuries anyone could ever want. However under the calm & calculating exterior Patrick has psychological problems as he has a violent blood-lust which he satisfies by killing people he has contempt for & he also likes perverted sex sessions with prostitutes (then again who wouldn't?). His latest victim Paul Allen (Jared Leto) is missed & his fiancÃ© hires private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) to find him, will Patrick be exposed as the homicidal maniac that he is or can he get away with it...This American Canadian co-production was co-written & directed by Mary Harron & I have to say that I didn't think that much of it despite it's reputation. The social satire laden script by Harron & Guinevere Turner who played Elisabeth the high class prostitute in the film was based on the controversial novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis & I just don't 'get' it's appeal or why anyone would particularly want to sit down & watch it, overall I think it's quite a dull & repetitive film with some nice dialogue & a few decent scenes which save it from total banality. Some of Bateman's monologues along with the amusing yet pointless speeches about the merits of 80's pop groups & the style of people's business cards are pretty funny at times if trivial & if your looking for some sex & nudity then American Psycho might do it for you. I was expecting more in the horror department if I'm honest, there's barely a drop of blood in it & certainly nothing graphic, pretty much all of the character's are very unlikeable & one dimensional with Willem Dafoe's cop getting about three scenes before he is completely dropped & I also thought it was boring with pretty much the same thing happening scene after scene. I wasn't impressed by the ambiguous ending either which tries to be clever but I just found it frustrating as it never clarifies if it was all in Bateman's imagination. Personally I didn't think it was anything to write home about but there does seem to be a lot of people out there who like it, so maybe I just went into it with the wrong expectations & quite simply it's just not for me.Director Harron does OK, there's a nice elegance to the way this is shot with nice camera slick moves. The film nails the whole 80's yuppie thing very well as these unlikeable people spend money like water, care for nothing or no one but themselves & have beautiful apartments for which I'm very jealous. I found myself becoming bored with all the yuppie satire going on & again it just felt very repetitive. I wouldn't say there's anything scary here or even particularly that violent although there are a couple of fairly strong sex scenes.With a supposed budget of about $8,000,000 this looks nice enough with sleek & stylish cinematography but what does that matter when the film did so little for me? Set in New York it was actually mostly filmed in Ontario in Canada. The acting is OK, I don't really know if I liked Christian Bale's performance or not. Willem Dafoe is utterly wasted in a nothing part.American Psycho is trying to be a complex dark thriller which wants to say something about 80's upper class society in New York, I'm sorry but weren't the 80's like 20 years ago? I'm sure there are many out there who like or even love this film & I'm proud to say right here & now that I'm not one of them, average at best & an irrelevant bore at worst. Followed by the straight-to-video American Psycho 2: All American Girl (2002) which has no connection to this at all apart from a vague Patrick Bateman reference.",5,9,19,17 June 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Nowhere near as good as the first two but still watchable enough in it's own right.
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines starts in Beverley Hills as a morphing killing machine named the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is transported back from the future, meanwhile in a desert not fat away another killer android named the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) also arrives from the future. They are both in search of future resistance leader & the saviour of mankind John Connor (Nick Stahl), the T-X has orders to kill him while the T-800 has orders to protect him. John himself breaks into a vet's clinic to steal drugs & is found by Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the two become the center of a battle between the Terminator's as one wants them dead & the other not. Then John learns that the threat of Skynet has not been stopped, merely postponed & with the new Judgement Day fast approaching he decides to try & prevent it, again.This American, German & British co-production was directed by Jonathan Mostow (apparently with the likes of Ang Lee, Ridley Scott & James Cameron being asked but turning it down) & is obviously the second sequel to James Cameron's superb sci-fi action hit The Terminator (1984), Cameron himself also wrote & directed the sequel Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) which is quite simply one of the greatest films ever, period. So with two such illustrious predecessors that quite rightly consider solid gold classics how does Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines hold up? Well the script takes the basic concept from Terminator 2: Judgement Day & goes with that, two Terminators sent back from the future, one to protect Connor the other to kill him, Connor trying to destroy Skynet & prevent Judgement Day from ever happening & a parade of big budget set-piece action scenes. Compared to the first two terminator film Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't as good but I still found it enjoyable in it's own right & competing against two of the best films of all time is pretty difficult to do anyway. The makers seem to have changed the character of John Connor & what he was about, from a rebellious & resourceful youngster to a bit of a bland loser, the two Terminator's aren't played as emotionless androids either with both spouting various one-liners & making faces which is alright but doesn't seem right & while the story is fine it's nothing more than a rehash of ideas from the first two & doesn't take the franchise forward at all & by comparison to Cameron's films this is a little soulless. Having said that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines entertained me no end, I loved the new female Terminator (even though she feels like a gimmick), it moves along like a rocket & there are some terrific action set-pieces including an amazing car chase involving a huge crane. There are loads of explosions, fights, shoot-outs, car chases, pure wanton destruction & cool effects to keep me happy anyway. Sure Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't the greatest film ever plot wise but there's enough going on elsewhere to enjoy to make this well worth a watch in my opinion.The CGI computer effects are good & there are some terrific action sequences which is where Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines excels. The crane chase is a real stand-out moment & one of my all time favourite car chases featuring lots of explosions, outrageous stunts & general vehicular mayhem on a grand scale. Despite an 'R' rating in the US this got away with a '12' here in the UK & it does feel a little bit family friendly with the absolute minimum of violence shown which may not be a problem to most but I am a bit of a violence junkie & I missed it since we got violence in spades in the first two. While not as menacing as either Scwarzenegger from the first or Robert Partick from the second film Kristanna Locken is hot & looks totally gorgeous in her red leather catsuit, OK so I'm a shallow male what can I say? I loved any scene she was in & she has a real sexy & dangerous femininity about her although her special powers aren't that much of a step forward from those seen in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. There are nods & gags to the original two films that seem a little forced but are quite fun from Arnie's sunglasses to an amusing cameo by Earl Bohen reprising his role as Dr. Silberman.With a supposed budget of $170,000,000 you can see where the money went with virtual non stop action & flashy CGI effects, you certainly get your money's worth here. The film is well made but doesn't have Cameron's cold & stylish look & I really missed Brad Fiedel's stirring music that has been replaced by a much more forgettable & generic sounding soundtrack. The acting is alright, Schwarzenegger is OK, Stahl is bland, Danes is alright after having replaced Sophia Bush at short notice after a few days filming while Kristanna Locken was cast for her looks & excels in that department at least.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was never going to exceed it's predecessors which in my (& many other's) humble opinion are two of the greatest films ever made but for what it is I really enjoyed it. So sue me. The telly series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008 - 2009) totally ignores the events of this while a fourth film Terminator Salvation (2009) has just opened.",7,7,13,1 June 2009
The Shining," 'I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel over the years & not all of them good.' A great horror film.
","The Shining starts with Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) driving to an isolated hotel named the 'Overlook' situated high in the Colorado mountains for an interview with it's manager Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson) about becoming the Winter caretaker. Ullman tells Jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh Winter sets in. Together with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) & young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) Jack moves into the hotel & at first everything seems fine, it's a beautiful hotel, absolutely huge & whatever they need is at their disposal. However the Overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide & Danny has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see & hear things 'ordinary' people can't. As the days, weeks & months begin to pass Jack become more & more insane, Danny keeps 'seeing' things & people while Wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family, as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped Jack finally loses it...This English production was co-written, co-produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick & is a fine horror film. It appears that The Shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions & the one I will be commenting on is the shorter European cut that runs just under 2 hours in length. The script by Kubrick & Diane Johnson, is based on the novel by Stephen King which I have not read so I can't compare them, goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film. There are very few character's in The Shining with Jack, Wendy & Danny the only ones that really matter, since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them, become involved with them & what they go through. The pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout. On the negative side I don't think the reasoning behind Jack going crazy & wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me, the fact that Jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me & I don't know if I missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever, I'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about! There is very little in the way of violence or gore, a couple of rotten zombie ghosts & someone is killed with an axe but The Shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood & special effects as it has a gripping story. With a budget of about $19,000,000 The Shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as Kubrick, the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free-flowing & smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the maze of corridors, the sets look absolutely real & instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark corners, basements & cobwebs Kubrick brings things right up-to-date with brightly lit corridors, massive open expansive spaces & a modern decor (well 80's modern, just check that red toilet out!). The acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying & Nicholson seems crazy from the very start. The Shining is an absorbing film that I enjoyed watching although I'm not sure I'd watch it again anytime soon. For those looking for explosions & fancy special effects you will be disappointed, for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story I definitely think The Shining is for you, well worth a watch in my humble opinion.",8,11,18,11 November 2005
"I, Robot"," Enjoyable Sci-Fi action thriller blockbuster.
","I, Robot is set in Chicago, 2035 where the headquarters of US Robotics is located. US Robotics is the largest manufacturer of robots in the world & the use of Robot servants by humans is common, the Robots are governed by three laws which prevent them from harming a human but homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is suspicious of them. Spooner then gets a holographic message from US Robotics founder & Robot creator Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) who has recently committed suicide. Del suspects that Lanning discovered something about his Robots & that they killed him but no-one believes him. Together with Robot psychologist Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) detective Spooner investigates Lannings suicide & becomes convinced it was murder & that the Robots which are everywhere & in almost every home in the world are planning something...This American German co-production was originally developed under the title Hardwired & was directed by Alex Proyas, I must admit I actually really rather liked this big budget CGI laden Sci-Fi action blockbuster. Apparently taking the works of Isaac Asimov (the Robotic three laws in particular) as inspiration the script by Jeff Vintar & Akiva Goldsman starts off in intriguing murder mystery fashion, an old school detective thriller set in the future as it were but then with about thirty odd minutes to go it turns into the predicted overblown noisy Hollywood action vehicle which is fine since I suppose that's all anyone really expected it to be anyway. The neat murder mystery elements are a good bonus while they last & I liked I, Robot more when it was dealing with the murder & various conspiracies than when it decides to go down the huge action set-piece route. The character's are a bit thin on the ground & it takes Will Smith to really carry the film which he does. Love him or loathe him one has to say he sure has made some great films & his acting is getting better, I must admit I thought he was great in I, Robot & he turns Spooner into a really charismatic likable hero with plenty of amusing one-liners & quips. I loved the exchange he has with Dr. Calvin where she ask's if he has 'Ever had a normal day?' to which he replies 'Yeah, once. It was a Thursday'. Well it made me laugh anyway. The film has a good pace, it moves along in a logical & interesting way which keeps you watching & overall it's an effective & enjoyable futuristic thriller.The vision of the future that I, Robot paints is actually very hard to believe if you think about it, upright walking Robotics is more or less dead & has no practical use. Even now there's no great desire or need for Robots like the ones in the film & they wouldn't work in reality as in the film anyway. I, Robot is packed with CGI computer effects, in fact I would bet there aren't too many scenes which don't feature some sort of optical effect. While they look nice enough & are animated with great detail you just know that what your looking at is a CGI computer graphic. Not once during I, Robot did I actually think I was looking at a real Robot. There are some good set-pieces including a house being demolished while Will Smith is still inside it, there's some nice motorbike stunts, an expensive looking CGI sequence set in a tunnel where Will Smith in his car is attacked by dozens of Robots & a dizzying final sequence set inside a huge computer core control room.With a supposed budget of about $120,000,000 I, Robot had the budget of a small country at it's disposable (although Will Smith apparently got paid $28,000,000) so as one would expect it looks great with expensive looking CGI, big set-pieces, immaculate production design & a really clean futuristic look. Apparently Denzel Washington was offered the role of Del Spooner, luckily he either didn't accept it or he was replaced & I doubt I, Robot would be as much fun without Will Smith. The rest of the acting is alright although no-one is given much to do.I, Robot is a fun big budget blockbuster that I must admit I really liked, at the end of the day it's nothing more than good fun but what else do you want? Thanks to a charismatic performance from Will Smith & plenty of action I say this one is well worth a watch. According to the IMDb I, Robot 2 (2010) is currently in development.",7,0,0,5 July 2008
Wanted," I thought it was alright but not much more than that.
","Wanted is set in Chicago where Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) works in an office as an accounts manager, he is bored with his life & feels that it's pointless. While in a supermarket Wesley is saved by a woman (Angelina Jolie) who he has never met before after an assassin named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) tries to kill him, the woman who turns out to be called Fox takes Wesley back to an old textile mill which is a front for a secret organisation of assassins known as The Faculty which was founded a thousand years ago to kill people that fate decides in order to keep the balance between good & evil in the world. Wesley meets Sloan (Morgan Freeman) who runs the show & is told that Cross used to be a member of The Factulty but left & is killing other members of one-by-one & that Cross has already killed Wesley's father. The Factulty train Wesley to be a top assassin in order to go after & kill Cross but all is not as it seems as Wesley discovers he has been lied to...This American & German co-production was directed by Timur Bekmambetov & is generally considered one of the better big budgeted Hollywood action films of recent years & while it's entertaining enough & I have no major problem with it I have to say I don't consider Wanted the classic that many seem to, I will stop short of calling it a bad film because it's not but I can't bring myself to call it a great one either. Wanted is loosely based on a graphic novel comic book miniseries by Scottish artist Mark Millar published between 2003 & 2004, apparently the main difference is that The Faculty in the comic book was run by super villains who killed all the superheroes or something like that as I have never even heard of the comic books before watching the film so I really don't know anything about them. While a lot of the people who rate th film Wanted enjoy the totally unrealistic & psychically impossible action scenes like cars flipping over & doing barrel rolls mid air to the way certain character's can bend bullets round corners or make them fly in perfect circles I found these cartoon style scenes off putting & took me right out of the film & just stopped it dead as I was left shaking my head, sure some of the best action films around are far fetched & stretch credibility but the things that happen in Wanted are just too silly & left me cold & detached from the plot twists & story which aren't that great anyway. Everything about Wanted is a stretch really, from the plot twists to the fact that within a few weeks Wesley has turned into some super assassin who takes out the entire Faculty without them even getting a shot off at him. Wanted probably works best during it's first half as we are introduced to Wesley & his boring nine to five life as he is used & abused by everyone around him, his narration is quite funny & there are some amusing scenes like when he tells his fat boss what he thinks of her & going to the cash machine & seeing messages that mock his life but as has been said before it feels a lot like Fight Club (1999) during these scenes, they have a certain dry, ironic relevance & a lot of what Wesley says seems to make sense & might be all too familiar for a lot of us I suppose.At just over 100 minutes long Wanted zips along at a nice pace, to be fair to it Wanted never lets up & there's overblown action scene after overblown action scene that seem to have been written, designed & shot purely to look cool & not much else. From cars flipping over each other to acrobatics on high speed trains to a derailment to crashing cars, car chases, shoot-outs, explosions, fights & a very attention grabbing opening in which a guy leaps hundreds of feet between skyscrapers while firing & taking out a team of assassins as he flies through the air. Wanted is pretty violent as well, there';s a fair bit of blood & a few scenes of bullets travelling in slow motions as they go through people's heads & burst out the front splattering blood everywhere.With a supposed budget of about $75,000,000 a lot of money was spent on Wanted & it show's with no expense spared action scenes & CGI computer effects which are pretty good. Filmed in Illinois, New York & Prague in the Czech Republic. The acting is alright, Morgan Freeman seems bored, James McAvoy seems a bit boyish & slight to be a tough action hero while Angelina Jolie is as awful as always & again Wanted proves you should not hire rappers like Common to try & act.Wanted is a decent enough action film as long as you can suspend every ounce of disbelief you have, I mean every ounce of it. Wanted works best when it's trying to be humorous & has some amusing dark satire that feels all to familiar, look I thought Wanted was a good film & I'd recommend it & watch it again but I didn't think it was as great as many seem to. Apparently a sequel is currently in development.",5,0,2,18 June 2012
Disturbia," Terrible, tame teen Rear Window remake.
","Disturbia starts as teenager Kale (Shia LaBeouf) & his father are driving home & are involved in a car accident in which Kale's father is killed. One year later & Kale is provoked in Spanish class by his teacher (Rene Rivera) & punches him, a Judge sentences Kale to three month house arrest. While at home Kale becomes bored & starts spying on his neighbours, he sees one named Robert Turner (David Morse) act suspiciously & after hearing about missing local girls on the news Kale becomes convinced that his neighbour is a serial killer as Turner owns the exact same type of classic car seen driving away from one crime scene. Kale & his friends continue to spy on Turner but he soon realises that he is being watched & isn't happy about it at all...Directed by D.J. Caruso I have to say right away that I thought this was total crap & a huge disappointment, Disturbia could have been great & used our obsession with knowing other's business to great effect but all the potential is wasted in a crap film of little merit. The script is an obvious rip-off of Hitchcock's classic Rear Window (1954) & the owners of the original short story that inspired Raer Window sued Universal & SKG for copyright infringement, the basic plot are exactly the same in both as a house bound character who starts spying on his neighbours thinks he has found a murderer. In Disturbia (a combination of the words disturbing & suburbia which is as clever as the film ever gets) the themes & ideas are updated a bit, instead of someone recovering from a broken leg here it's a teen under house arrest & he starts spying on his good looking blonde neighbour & the use of mobile phones, camcorders & computers plants the story in modern times although it is still the same story. There are no surprises at all, the final half an hour makes no sense & I can't believe how predictable it is, where was the suspense & ambiguity? Why is everything so straight forward & why does it all play out exactly as we expect it too? Why not even an attempt at a twist in the story? The films attempts to convey paranoia, suspicion & voyeurism are pathetic, for a thriller there are zero thrills & it doesn't really work as a horror film either as it's pretty tame & simply not dark enough until the final twenty minutes although there's plenty of boring soap opera style teen angst dramatics that I found rather embarrassing to watch with romance, trust, grief & friendship all getting the clichéd American teen treatment. At over 100 minutes it's slow, the assumptions that Kale makes to decide that Turner is a serial killer are ridiculous, why doesn't Turner just close the curtains? Why is he so open about what he does, it's surprising he hasn't been caught before. Once Turner know's he's being spied on why doesn't he get rid of the evidence or just get the hell out of there?I also really dislike the look & feel of Disturbia, once again very wealthy upper class Americans who never seem to have to work or have any money worries as the big houses & expensive car & possessions are way beyond the average person & it's hard to relate to these people at times. This is not the real world & doesn't come close to depicting it. Disturbia is just full of wealthy Americans who never seem to care about anything meaningful. With a family friendly PG rating there's no real nudity or violence here & it's very tame. Apparently Disturbia was shot in two different cities, although Kale & Turner's homes are meant to be on the same street next door to each other in real life they were actually located in two different cities miles apart. There's a considerable lack of tension as the film is so slow & once Turner is exposed as a killer all logic goes out of the window.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 I can't really see where all that money went really, filmed in California it looks nice enough but forgettable with a total lack of style or imagination. The acting is OK at best, I didn't like anyone here to be honest or their performance.Disturbia is a film that I hated, I thought it was a boring, predictable & tame Rear Window copy that failed to deliver on it's premise of paranoia & voyeurism in any meaningful way. A slow boring mess of a script with a lack of logic or sense doesn't help either, a not very thrilling thriller.",2,4,6,4 May 2010
Edward Scissorhands," A touching fantasy fairytale from Tim Burton.
","Edward Scissorhands starts as Avon representative Peggy Boggs (Dianne Wiest) drives up to the spooky old castle that sits on-top of a hill overlooking her average suburban town, hoping to sell some cosmetics Peggy discovers a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp) who has large shears for hands. Alone & unfamiliar with normal life Peggy insists that Edward come back home & live with her & her family. Having no contact with the outside world before Edward finds things hard & unusual at first, his scissorhands don't help him either. Edwards meets Peggy's teenage daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) & falls in lover with her but at first finds him a bit of a freak & Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) takes a real dislike to Edward. Using Edward to break into his parents house Jim leaves Edward to take the blame when the police turn up, the whole neighbourhood turns against Edward who seeks comfort in his castle but people just won't leave him alone...Produced & directed by Tim Burton this dark modern fairytale is so Burton in style & substance & remains one of his best films, it's a tender & heartfelt piece of fantasy filmmaking that might just make you smile & cry in equal measure. Edward Scissorhands feels like a deeply personal film from Burton & has all his usual trademarks, the main hero is an eccentric outcast of society & Edward Scissorhands feels like Burton's take on the Frankenstein story as he tries to show Edward as a tragic figure, a victim of circumstance & the script (which was apparently written at first as a musical) manages to impart great sympathy on Edward & his plight. Edward as a character has a unique, naive, lonely man with a child like innocence. Edward is a great creation, if you can accept his scissorhands & the fantasy behind him his journey through the film is heartwarming & touchingly told with some amazingly written moments even though he only says 169 words during the entire duration. From his introduction to normal society to his falling in love & the eventual turning against him as he naivety & innocence is used for sinister purposes. A charming fairytale with strong fantasy aspects that is heartwarming & got me quite emotional on a few occasions. There's a certain deadpan satirical humour to it as well that plays brilliantly against the fantasy fairytale story. At an hour & forty minutes the time flew by for me & watching Edward come full circle in the film is a joy to witness.Like most Burton films there's a dark Gothic style to Edward Scissorhands along with it's colourful suburban town setting & again the contrast works perfectly. There are many great moments in Edward Scissorhands, the moment when Edward sits on the curb unhappy & then cuts that dogs fringe is cute, the nice image of Winona Ryder dancing in flakes of snow as Edward craves a huge ice sculpture or the funny dinnertime scenes where Edward is used to carve the roast! The production values are top notch & Edward Scissorhands looks great throughout, from the brightly painted suburban houses to the dark Gothic castle a lot of time was obviously spent on the look of this.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 you can see where the money went, apparently filmed in Florida. Tom Cruise, Jim Carrey & Robert Downey Jr. were all considered for the role of Edward Scissorhands but Johnny Depp is great in the part anyway. Vincent Price makes his last screen appearance in a nice little cameo role.Edward Scissorhands is a touching fairytale that I enjoyed a lot, you really have to accept the character's & the events but if you can than this is a great film.",7,0,2,26 December 2010
Van Helsing," Top quality big budget monster bashing action packed entertainment.
","Van Helsing starts in 'Transylvania 1887' where Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West) succeeds in bring his creation (Shuler Hensley) to life, however the evil Count Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) wants it & the secret of Frankenstein's experiments to help him give life to his young... Jump forward 'One Year Later' to 'Vatican City Rome' where Cardinal Jinette (Alun Armstrong) orders monster killer Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) to Transylvania to destroy Count Dracula, Van Helsing has little choice. Once there Van Helsing meets up with Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) who is also trying to kill Count Dracula, they team up together to achieve this goal but they quickly discover it's not as easy as they had hoped...This American Czech Republic co-production was written, co-produced & directed by Stephen Sommers & I have to say I have now seen Van Helsing twice & enjoyed it immensely both times. The script is set in a fictional Victorian world which lots of familiar monsters & character's inhabit & it has them all meet up, in this sense it's very similar to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) although I think Van Helsing is a better film. Anyway, the film moves along like an absolute rocket, you can't take your eyes off it for a second or you'll miss a fight, a monster, a great set, a ridiculously extravagant set-piece or just Kate Beckinsale in that super sexy outfit complete with ultra tight corset & thigh boots. The entire film is littered with references to other classic horror/action films, in fact I'd say maybe it relies too much on paying homage & not quite enough time on being original but when a films this much fun I'll cut it some slack. The character's are not that well developed but since most will already be familiar with them who cares? On a negative side perhaps the pace is too fast, no-one ever seems to stop to catch a breathe & as a result as I've mentioned the character's & plot are given little to develop & suffer plus there is some truly awful dialogue that at times is quite embarrassing & then there's the fact it lasts for over 2 hours, on a personal level I dislike films which are too long & I'd have preferred Van Helsing to be a bit shorter although I can't think of anything I'd like to see less of. Overall though I thought it was a cracker & provides terrific non-stop entertainment as long as your not after something serious or deep, which I'm not because for me films are ALL about entertainment, it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Sommers does OK, having said that he seems intent on bombarding us with non stop CGI special effects, fights, action set-pieces & monsters, while for the most part they're spectacular it does get a bit repetitive after a solid two hours of the stuff. To be honest in a weird way I feel like I'm criticising a Lottery win because I won too much money, strange eh? With so much overblown CGI on show there's no subtlety in Van Helsing at all, forget about much suspense or any of the scares which the original films Van Helsing was based on were all about. To keep the rating down the violence in Van Helsing isn't explicit & forget about any blood as it's not that sort of horror film.With a mind boggling supposed budget of about $160,000,000 (!) Van Helsing looks brilliant, everything is so extravagant, the special effects are top-notch, the set-pieces are as big as they come & the whole thing looks fabulous with some cool sets from the Transylvanian village to the interior (& exterior for that matter) of Count Dracula's Gothic castle to Dr. Frankenstein's lab & I love the story in the IMDb's 'Trivia' section for Van Helsing which claims that the lab was equipped with antique medical equipment purchased on eBay! The acting isn't up to much but then did you expect it to be? You know I really do think it was a great decision to cast Beckinsale who is a real hot looking bird & have her kicking the hell out of people in that outfit, good work all round I reckon. Roxburgh complete with earrings makes for a slightly campy but still quite cool Dracula.Van Helsing isn't for everyone that's for sure, the purists & those looking for something a little quieter & a bit more serious should avoid it. Those looking for top big budget mindless entertainment to pass a couple of hours, don't mind the odd lapse in logic & like hot women in tight corsets & thigh boots then Van Helsing could very well be the film for you. I loved pretty much every overblown, over-the-top second of it & if you have a problem with that sue me...",8,0,7,25 December 2006
Face_Off," Not as good as I remember back in the day.
","Face/Off starts in Los Angeles where international terrorist & all round bad guy Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) has just planted a huge bomb at an exhibition center that will has the potential to kill thousands, however special ops agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) & his team have been tracking Troy for years & after a lead comes good they discover that Troy is about to take off in a private jet. Archer & his team get there in time & stop Troy from leaving Los Angeles but Troy is badly injured in a shoot-out & ends up in a coma. On a computer disk found on Troy there are plans for the bomb & Archer know's that Troy has planted it somewhere. The only other person who would know where the bomb is happens to be Troy's brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) but he obviously won't talk to Archer or the authorities so in an elaborate plan to fool Pollux into revealing the location of the bomb cutting edge medical procedures are used to surgically attach Troy's face onto Archer but the plan goes awry when Troy wakes up from his coma & has Archer's face surgically attached & takes over his life as the real Archer is trapped in prison as everyone thinks he's the real Castor Troy...Directed by John Woo this was originally released back in 1997 & I saw it around that time when it came out on DVD & since then I hadn't seen it again until last night & I have to confess that I was rather disappointed with Face/Off & it's one of those films that is nowhere near as good as I remember it. I guess when we are younger we are more easily pleased & the two impressive action scenes which bookend the film are most people's overriding memory of Face/Off which conceals the fact that the hour & a half between those two sequences in my opinion is rather dry & boring. The script features the usual Woo trademarks of honour, revenge, trust, loss & flying doves but I must admit I found it all a bit pedestrian. The initial shoot-out at the airport & the switching of faces is neat & pacey but after that the films slows right down as the drama kicks in & in a film with a fairly silly premise serious drama just doesn't quite work. The basic idea of having the hero & villain swap identities to the extent where they assume each other's lives & what effect that has on them is amusing for a short time but it wears thin pretty quickly as you count down the minutes the inevitable showdown between the two. Having said that the film is perfectly entertaining & has a few excellent stand-out action set-pieces that really stay in the memory.The film has some very impressive action scenes & they are stylishly shot with an actual steadicam you we can actually see what's going on! The violence is moderate consisting of mostly shoot-outs but they are choreographed with flair & panache. The science involved in the face transplant scenes is total nonsense & didn't sit well with me, what about Castor's teeth? Did they take all of Archer's own teeth out & replace them? You really do have to suspend your disbelief & just about everything you know about medical science to believe the procedures on show here & that's a big problem, since you don't believe it the film never quite recovers or works as it is intended. Apparently Face/Off was going to be set in the future but it was changed to the present & I definitely think the story as a whole would have been a lot more plausible set at some point in the near future.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 this actually turned a profit which slightly surprises me, to be honest eighty big ones sounds like a lot of money to me & apart from the opening & closing action scenes I am not quite sure where it all went although Travolta was paid apparently paid a cool $15,000,000 while Cage got a more modest yet still not bad $6,000,000 so that's over twenty million of the budget gone already. The acting is alright, Travolta puts in a good performance while Cage less so.Face/Off is a film you will remember for several excellent action set-pieces that stay in the memory much longer than the sub standard soap opera drama that passes for much of the middle ninety minutes. Not too bad overall but not as good as I remember from the first time around.",6,2,3,22 December 2008
Spider-Man," It's a good job Peter Paker isn't afraid of heights... Almost great but not quite.
","Spider-Man is set in New York where nerdy high school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lives with his aunt May (Rosemary Harris) & uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), while on a school field trip to the research laboratories at Columbia University he is bitten by a genetically engineered spider. Over the next few days Peter undergoes an amazing transformation, he gets stronger, develops the ability to climb sheer walls & shoot thick webbing from his wrists. Peter has turned into a spider-man, the physical appearance of a man but with the strength, agility & web shooting powers of an ordinary spider. However tragedy strikes & uncle Ben is killed by a thief, from that moment on Peter decides to use his amazing spider like powers to fight crime in New York. Calling himself Spider-Man Peter's first big test comes in the form of the evil Green Goblin...Directed by Sam Raimi this was the first time the hugely popular Spider-Man superhero comic book character appeared in a film despite having featured in various cartoon & live action TV show's, a huge box-office hit when originally released back in May 2002 in US theatres I actually remember going to see it when it was released here in the UK a month later in June & I specifically remember not liking it that much. Having watched it again last night for the first time in over 5 years I actually enjoyed it a lot more but I still didn't think it was the 100% solid gold classic many make it out to be. The script by David Koepp tries to have it's cake & eat it, it tries to present a very serious world where Peter Parker has all the usual teenage trouble with girls, bullies & family in some really rather dull & dour drama yet at any given moment it can shift into over-the-top fantasy comic book mode with Spider-Man swinging between New York skyscrapers & the Green Goblin flying around on his glider. I personally thought the transition between the two at times is quite jarring & badly handled & I just often thought the serious drama & the fantasy comic book action didn't sit that well together. At a good 2 hours in length I also felt there wasn't really enough story here & it could have used a bit of editing to quicken the pace up. Then there's the Green Goblin, was anyone else throughly disappointed by him? In the comic books & cartoon series the Green Goblin is just that, a green creature rather than a guy in a green outfit & silly mask. Also what was the Green Goblin's ultimate plan? I mean I know he killed the board members so Norman could take complete control of the company but what was his purpose after that? Did he have any more plans? I don't think so, he just seemed 'there' for Spider-Man to fight but why? To me the Green Goblin after he had killed the board members seemed like a totally pointless & motiveless character.Director Raimi has fun, there are some truly outstanding CGI computer effects & action scenes. The end in particular is impressive as is the fight between the Green Goblin & Spider-Man in a burning building, the shots of Spider-Man swinging through the streets of New York are majestic & look most impressive. However there is one goof that I noticed the first time I saw it, it's a shot present in the trailer & it really annoyed me last night as well, there's a scene when Spider-Man rescues Mary Jane from the collapsing balcony & she is holding onto him while he swings across the street. Well, if you look at the shot they are swinging from left to right but her hair is blowing to the right when it should be blowing to the left, it's like standing in front of a wind machine & your hair blowing in the direction the wind is coming from. The Spider-Man costume looks really good actually, several were made & they apparently cost $100,000 each. The film has some stylish moments & is fun to look at during the fantasy action sequences but not so much during the drama scenes.With a budget of about $100,000,000 with another $30,000,000 on top of that for advertising Spider-Man was a well funded film & it comes as no surprise the production design, sets & special effects are superb. Although set in New York it was largely filmed in Los Angeles. The acting is OK but no-one stood out as being great, even Maguire wasn't anything special although Willem Dafoe puts in quite a good performance. Nominated for two Oscars, Best Sound & Best Visual Effects, it ended up winning neither.Spider-Man is almost a great film, not many comic strips make good films but Spider-Man nearly pulls it off, a slightly slow pace, a disappointing villain & some slushy sentimental drama stop it from achieving greatness. Definitely a god film worth a watch but it's not the flawless piece of film-making many make it out to be. To date this has been followed by a further three sequels, Spider-Man 2 (2004), Spider-Man 3 (2007) & Spider-Man 4 (2009) which is currently in production.",6,0,1,19 November 2007
Dark City," A fine sci-fi, but maybe a little too clever & complex for it's own good.
","Dark City tells the puzzling tale of John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), one fateful night he wakes up in unfamiliar surroundings, a bathtub in a sleazy motel room & has no memory of how he got there. John investigates the room & finds a dead prostitute on the floor (never a good thing in any situation!) & a suitcase in which a postcard of a place called 'Shell Beach' seems to have some significance to him but John can't remember why. John then receives a phone call from Dr. Daniel P. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) who says that people are coming to get him & he should leave straight away, advice which John wisely takes. The motel manager (Ritchie Singer) discovers the dead prostitute & the police are brought in, Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) is on the case & John his his number 1 suspect. Meanwhile John has an encounter with several alien controlled men dressed in black but he manages to escape. Eventually John meets Dr. Schreber face to face who informs John that an almost extinct race of aliens known as 'Strangers' put the entire city to sleep every night during which time they change people's memory's & the psychical layout of the city with a special power they have. Dr. Schreber goes on to explain to John that he also has this power & must use it in the fight against the Strangers in a bid to put an end to their sinister plans & liberate the dark city...This Australian American co-production was co-written, co-produced & directed by Alex Proyas & is a thoughtful sci-fi film that has an intriguing central idea if nothing else. The script by Proyas, David S. Goyer & Lem Dobbs is audacious in it's ambitions while the scale & scope of the story is a bit overwhelming at times. Dark City hooks you from the word go, although maybe the prologue reveals a little too much, & it certainly has it's fair share of twists, turns & the story takes various imaginative directions. However, I became a bit lost towards the end, it's not that I didn't know what was happening but I just felt too much was happening, the film wanted to do so much so quickly that I started to lose interest. I also didn't like the fact that it was so far removed from reality (in every possible way) that I had a hard time caring or relating to anyone or anything. As a whole Dark City is a unique piece of film-making, it shows intelligence, imagination & it mostly entertains although I also think that dark City is a film that you shouldn't think about too hard & just accept what's going on as I'm not sure it would hold up to close scrutiny.Director Proyas lets his imagination run wild & Dark City has absolutely stunning production design, the sets, the buildings, the clothes, the cars, the architecture & just about everything in Dark City looks fabulous, it has a really atmospheric Gothic crossed with art-deco crossed with film-noir look & feel to it. Dark City is one of those films which is a pleasure to watch & it seems as if every single shot had huge amounts of time & effort put into it.With a supposed budget of around $27,000,000 it appears as if almost every penny ended up on screen rather than some A-list star's pocket. Dark City looks sumptuous throughout & has that big budget Hollywood feel to it. Some of the CGI effects look a bit dated now but their still more than acceptable. Apparently Dark City has one of the shortest average shot lengths of any modern film at just 1.8 seconds, basically there is a cut around every 2 seconds, that's incredible isn't it? The acting is good by all, Richard O'Brien is the stand out who steals every scene he's in.Dark City is an engaging sci-fi film that tries to do something different & it succeeds. I must admit I have a few misgivings about it especially the way I was getting bored towards the end & I thought that maybe it was a bit too bizarre & 'out there' for my liking. Overall I'd still say that I think it's well worth a watch for those who want something a bit different.",7,1,3,7 March 2006
The Fast and the Furious," 'If you want time buy the magazine.' Entertaining enough but rather shallow.
","The Fast and the Furious is set in Los Angeles & starts as undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) enters an illegal street race between racers with high performance sports cars, he bets his $80,000 car that he'll win but instead loses. Suddenly the cops show up & he manages to save Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) from being arrested, Brian gains Dominic's trust in an attempt to use his knowledge & contacts to identify & take down a gang of street racers who are hijacking huge container trucks & stealing millions of dollars of electrical goods...This American German co-production was directed by Rob Cohen who has a small cameo as the pizza delivery guy & is an entertaining action flick without ever reaching the heights of greatness. The script by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist & David Ayer moves along at a reasonable pace & has decent amounts of action but it never quite satisfied me totally in any area. The plot is predictable & pretty standard fare, the twists have little dramatic impact like the revelation that Brian is a cop or that Dominic is behind the hijackings. A lot more could have been done with them. I usually don't take the moral high ground but in the case of The Fast and the Furious I feel I have to considering the age group this will appeal too, I mean it turns the criminal element into hero's which didn't sit well with me especially at the end when the cop is more concerned about the scumbag hijackers than the poor innocent truck driver! This isn't as action packed as you might like either, sure there's a good opening street race through LA & some good stunts during the final hijack but otherwise it's all show & no substance, just like the cars featured in fact. There are plenty of scenes with high powered cars reeving their engines, plenty of scenes of nicely painted sports cars driving around & plenty of scenes of them breaking the speed limit but it doesn't really amount to much apart from the opening race & the final twenty minutes. The character's are OK if a bit clichéd (I mean Brian actually starts to respect Dominic after being around him for a while...), it keeps one interest & it certainly passes the time harmlessly enough without ever being outstanding.Director Cohen does OK & turns in a suitably glossy looking film that will probably appeal to the boy racers out there as it glamorises the notion of street racing, winning at any costs & show's these souped up sports cars in as good a light as just about any film out there. The cars themselves look nice enough for sure & they are a pleasant distraction whenever on screen I suppose, at least they divert attention away from the acting. The film has some style about it for sure, the opening street race for instance when they reach top speeds the lights outside the windows blur into one long bright line & there are other tricks used as well to make a cool sequence. The violence is minimal so there's no need to worry about that.With a supposed budget of about $38,000,000 I wouldn't call The Fast and the Furious exactly low budget but it's not up there with the 100 million plus Hollywood blockbusters, making $40,000,000 on it's opening weekend in theatres it did really well & I think it was a bit of a surprise to everyone involved with it. It's well made with some decent CGI computer effects as well as some good old fashion stunt work. I must admit I didn't like the loud electronic dance type music though. The acting is not great, Vin Diesel was paid a cool $2,000,000 apparently & he's pretty poor, just check out his speech to Brian about his father! Jordana Brewster & Michelle Rodriguez provide the good looks & do a fine job.The Fast and the Furious is a good solid action thriller, it's not that great in storytelling terms but I think it provides enough cool action, macho moments & fast cars to keep most quiet for 100 odd minutes. Followed by two sequels, 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) & The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) while a third sequel is currently in production.",6,2,6,25 December 2007
The Exorcist," A genre classic?
","The Exorcist is set in Georgetown in Washington DC where famed actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) & her twelve year old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) live in a large house. Having recently moved there after separating from her husband Chris becomes increasingly worried by her daughter's odd behaviour, Regan spouts obscenities, masturbates with a crucifix & acts very violently towards people. After various tests Doctor's are at a loss to explain medically what is wrong with Regan & suggest Chris contacts a psychiatrist or even stage a exorcism. Things continue to get worse as is turns out Regan is responsible for the murder of film director Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran), desperate Chris turns to Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller) for help who after his own investigation is convinced Regan is possessed by a demon & recommends to the Church that an exorcism be performed...Directed by William Friedkin one probably has to say that The Exorcist is one of the most famous & widely regarded horror films ever made with reports of audience members vomiting, fainting & mass walk-outs in theatres the film has a definite controversy & legacy surrounding it. Originally released on Boxing Day 1973 in the US at around the two hour mark The Exorcist was re-released in 2000 with about twelve minutes of restored footage & some subtle CGI work under the title The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen & it is this longer cut that I will be basing my comments on. The script by William Peter Blatty which was based on his novel stands up pretty well when viewed today, there's real building of momentum as the film starts off with a very normal mother & daughter only for the film to show Regan get worse & worse & the effect it has on the people around her & as it all snowballs. At first Regan's mother tries to cure her daughter with modern medical science but when that fails more unorthodox methods are used. The film has lots of religious overtones which probably didn't go down to well at the time of it's release with some really foul language, scenes of defiled statues in Church, Regan masturbating with a crucifix & the eventual exorcism which the film ultimately builds up to. The character's are very good, the film certainly held my interest throughout even though I generally dislike long films & there are one or two iconic & memorable set-pieces like the head twisting scene & of course the green vomit the possessed Regan spews over Karras. My only real problem is that The Exorcist goes on for a bit too long, while I didn't get bored I did start to look at the clock, it's never explained what the mysterious noises in the attic were & I wasn't keen on the new ending with Kinderman & Dyer walking off to the 'this could be the start of a beautiful relationship' line.With a filming schedule that was originally planned for 85 days yet went on for 224 the film has a certain intensity & a cold matter of fact style about it, the camera remains quite static & the shots are very long unlike films today where it looks like the cameraman is having a fit & the editing is so quick you can barely tell whats happening. There are some great moments & I especially love the unexpected jump scare in the attic when the candle bursts into flame, it's such a cheap scare effect yet so effective. The Exorcist isn't the goriest or most violent film ever made, there's only two dead bodies in it, some blood in a medical scene & that's about it, it's probably the disturbing nature of the things that happen that are so effective & memorable rather than because they are graphic. The special make-up effects by Oscar winner Dick Smith are superb as you would expect. Watching the extended version last night I was very aware of how little music there is in the film, in fact apart from the opening & closing credits I can't actually remember any during the film itself at all. There's a definite sense of unease & dread as the film builds up to it's climax & this is where I personally think the film fails to deliver, after such an excellent sustained build up the ending is nothing more than two guy's standing around a bed chanting silly sounding religious lines of dialogue.With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 The Exorcist is very well made & certainly looks good if a little basic by todays standards. The special effects are good & the new extended cut doesn't go overboard on the CGI. Filmed throughout New York, the Warner Bros. studios in California, Washington & Iraq in which an all British film crew were hired since the US had no diplomatic relations with Iraq back then, not that they do now of course either! The acting is very good from a strong cast, although Linda Blair played the possessed Regan & was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for the role she was actually dubbed throughout.The Exorcist is regarded as some sort of landmark classic in the horror genre which I suppose it is & while it's an undeniably great film all round I don't hold it in such high regard since it's just not that much fun to watch. Followed by the entertainingly awful Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977), the average Exorcist III (1990) & the rather excellent prequel Exorcist: The Beginning (2004) which itself was re-cut & altered & re-released as Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist (2005).",7,3,8,18 July 2008

Meanwhile Jigsaw has set up yet another complex game involving a guy named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) whose son was killed in a road accident, Jeff is given the choice to save those he blames for his sons death from Jigsaw's killer traps & in turn save his own life...Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman I have to say I really rather liked Saw III even though I didn't like the original that much, I admit right here & now that I haven't seen Saw II (2005) but I don't think it particularly matters as I don't think Saw III directly follows on from it. First of all Saw III is another one of those films where there are a couple of versions floating around, a theatrical 'R' rated cut & the obligatory Unrated version which is the one I will be basing my comments on & is apparently a good 5 or 6 minutes longer. The script by Leigh Whannell who plays Adam in the film takes itself very seriously but moves along at a nice enough pace, there are a few neat twits & turns in there with the ending being particularly effective in my humble opinion & thankfully it doesn't shortchange us in the exploitation department either with some serious gore & torture scenes which some may find disturbing or sick although from a personal point of view I can't get enough of this stuff & the gorier & more sadistic the better. There are only a few character's in the film & their pretty well fleshed out, the dialogue is OK & as a whole the story is very satisfying with some memorable scenes like the part where Judge Halden is buried alive under a river of minced up rotten pigs intestine's & flesh, I don't know how similar this is to Saw II if at all because I haven't seen it but it's different enough from the original Saw (2004) to not feel that familiar & while overall it may not be a better film I thought it was more entertaining.Returning from Saw II director Bousman does a fine job, this has some nice colour schemes & has it's fair share of stylish moments although some of them are a little MTV-ish for my liking. This has some nice horror scenes in it with good tension, there's a nice dark atmosphere running throughout the film & of course there's some top gore in the Unrated version. People have their heads shot off, their rib cages pulled apart, people's limbs are twisted & broken complete with fractured bones bursting out of the skin, someone has huge hooks driven into their skin so they resemble something out of Hellraiser (1987), feet are bashed in & torn off, there is plenty of blood splashed around the place, there's one of the best slit throats I can remember seeing as someone uses a band-saw to slice someone's throat open, someone is shot in the neck with much spurting of blood as a result & my favourite part when Lynn graphically performs DIY brain surgery on Jigsaw using a power drill & a band-saw in a scene pretty much as explicit as they come. Most of the special effects seemed like actual on-set physical make-up effects rather than CGI which is another reason it looks so good. Saw III definitely satisfies in the gore department & for that I salute it! Just make sure you see the Unrated version although I think that's the version most commonly available pretty much everywhere.With a supposed budget of a modest sounding $10,000,000 Saw III wasn't going to able to compete with the mega budget Hollywood stuff but the filmmakers obviously used what they had well, it's well made throughout with impressive gore effects, sets & high production values. The acting is alright from a largely unknown cast (unknown to me anyway).Saw III is an excellent film in my opinion, it has some great gore scenes, it has some nice twists & turns & as a whole it's pretty interesting & entertaining. One of the better horror films of recent times I'd say & definitely well worth a watch for those with the stomach. Again directed by Bousman Saw IV (2007) will apparently be released latter this year around Halloween time...",8,1,6,13 June 2007
Duck You Sucker," I didn't like it at all & it felt like it went on forever.
","Giù la Testa is set in Mexico where Irish IRA explosives expert John Mallory (James Coburn) is on the run from one revolution & fight but soon finds himself in the thick of another when he teams up with Mexican bandit Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) & his gang, Juan forces John to help him & his gang rob the gold from a bank in the city of Mesa Verde using explosives but soon both are considered hero's for their antics. Drawn into the revolution Juan & John become important figures & commit themselves to the cause against oppression & their capitalist leaders...More commonly known amongst English speaking audiences under titles such as A Fistful of Dynamite & Duck, You Sucker (worst title for a film ever) this Italian production was co-written & directed by Sergio Leone & despite the whole world & it's brother seemingly liking it I personally hated Giù la Testa & it's as simple & straight forward as that. When originally released in the US Giù la Testa was heavily edited to a little over two hours & I thought it was that shorter version I was going to watch last night but due to a mistake the version I saw was the life sapping two & a half hour plus cut which bored me to tears, hell I was sat there watching this & for the last hour all I could think to myself was how much more of this crap do I have to sit through. I know Giù la Testa has a good reputation but I really saw nothing here to enjoy or recommend, I thought the tone was very uneven, I thought the plot was weak & could be more accurately described as a collection of loosely connected incidents, I thought the themes about revolution, war, redemption, running, honour, family & betrayal had little dramatic impact & it bored me stupid. I can't stress enough how bored I was watching Giù la Testa & the worst sin a film can commit in my eyes is to be boring.The film has a few sporadic moments of action, there's a few explosions, some shoot-outs & a crashing train but they are few & far between. Despite what anyone says the violence is tame, there's no blood or gore for instance. I will give Giù la Testa some credit for it's nice production design & cinematography, the film certainly looks nice if nothing else but that's not really enough. I mean if something bores you to tears it doesn't really matter how good it looks, does it? I don't quite understand where all the love for Giù la Testa comes from, I honestly didn't enjoy it at all & after a fairly striking opening thirty odd minutes I found myself losing all interest in it & becoming increasingly bored. It's never a good sign when you sit there & just keep saying to yourself that you wish something would just finish!Although set entirely in Mexico Giù la Testa was filmed almost entirely in Spain apart from some studio work in Italy. As I have said the film is visually nice with some nice cinematography but it's just so dull & boring. Rod Steiger & James Coburn make for decent leads.Giù la Testa is a film with a good reputation that I hoped I would enjoy but at over two & a half hours it bored me half to death, nope I am sorry but I don't have any love for Giù la Testa at all. I am sure there is an audience out there for a film such as Giù la Testa but it's not for me.",3,12,22,30 July 2008
Die Hard 2," 'I went to LA once... hated it.' Great sequel but not as good as the original.
","Die Hard 2 starts on Christmas Eve & is set at Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C. where Los Angeles cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) is waiting for the plane his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is on to land so they can spend Christmas together with her parents. However all is not well as Colonel Stuart (William Adler) & a highly trained team of mercenaries have taken complete control of the airport & all of it's functions, they turn the runway lights off so the planes above can't land & also disable the communication between the control tower & the plane's. A plane carrying a drug warlord named General Esperanza (Franco Nero) is due to land so he can stand trial, Colonel Stuart wants to free him but as several plane's above start to run out of fuel can McClane save the day & figure out a way to land them safely?Directed by Renny Harlin this is a fine action packed sequel to the original Die Hard (1988) although one has to say it's clearly not as good although with such a brilliant film to better it was never likely to. The script by Steven E. de Souza & Doug Richardson was based on the novel '58 Minutes' by Walter Wager & again sees LA cop John McClane fighting bad guy's at Christmas, for what it is Die Hard 2 is a great big budget Hollywood action packed blockbuster that's well worth a watch if your a 90's action fan. The character's are good although I still don't like McClane's wife Holly or that stupid reporter Richard Thornburg, particularly memorable are Dennis Franz's foul mouthed highly strung airport security chief Carmine & the no nonsense Major Grant. I also really liked the twist towards the end of the film as well & I must admit I didn't see it coming, other than that the plot is pretty straight forward, maybe a bit predictable yet easy to follow. The film is slow going at times & feels quite long but I'd never say it was boring with the constant race against time scenario McClane finds himself in, there's enough shoot-outs, violence, fights, chases & explosions to satisfy most & overall it's a great film. The chances of McClane finding himself in another situation like the original Die Hard does stretch the credibility somewhat but what the hell, it's only a film right?Director Harlin does alright, the action scenes are good but maybe not as good or as exciting as the original or some other big budget action films of the period. I doubt a film like Dir Hard 2 would be made today, almost certainly not by a major Hollywood studio with plane's full of passengers being deliberately crashed, terrorists hijacking an entire airport & holding all the plane's with passengers on them to ransom. Apparently barely completed before it was released Die Hard 2 had a huge budget which it went over by a considerable amount, rumour has it at one point Die Hard 2 was costing 20th Century Fox an extra $20,000 every minute of every day it was being shot. There are some good set-pieces here, the scene when McClane escapes the plane that gets blown up by hand-grenades is maybe the most memorable. There's plenty of violence too with icicles stuck in people's eyes, there's plenty of bloody gunshot wounds along with a nasty & very gory slashed throat.With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 this had a mega budget, it's well made for sure with great production values & you would never guess that the snow is fake. A couple of airports were used for filming locations including Los Angeles International & Stapleton Airport in Denver in Colorado, was originally set to be filmed in Minnesota but there was no snow that year so it was changed. Despite being paid a nice $7,500,000 Bruce Willis has said in a few interviews that he doesn't think too much of Die Hard 2 which is odd because he's been in lots worse films that's for sure, the acting is alright but that bloody Bonnie Bedelia just irritates me for some reason whenever she's on screen.Die Hard 2 is a great sequel to a even greater original that can stand on it's own as a top action packed thriller, at least it isn't a total turkey like a lot of sequels turn out to be. I definitely liked it & would certainly recommend it. Followed by Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) & the more recent Live Free or Die Hard (2007) both of which are well worth watching as well.",8,0,3,20 December 2007
Resident Evil," Playing the game is more fun than watching the film, having said that it ain't too bad.
","We start with some opening narration (by Jason Isaacs) that goes something like this, 'Confidential Report. Subject: the events leading up to the incident at Racoon City'. The narration continues, 'At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Umbrella corporation had become the largest commercial entity in the United States. 9 out of every 10 homes contain it's products. It's political and financial influence is felt everywhere. In public it is the worlds leading supplier of computer technology, medical products, health-care. Unknown even to it's own employees it's massive profits are generated by military technology, genetic experimentation, viral weaponry'. The film then cuts to a seemingly normal research facility. An unknown person or persons steal a futuristic looking case of vials containing some sort of top secret green and blue substance. Before leaving they smash one of the blue vials and the substance inside is spread throughout the rest of the building through the ventilation system with horrifying results! A beautiful woman (Milla Jovovich, her characters name is never mentioned but it happens to be Alice so that's what I will call her for the rest of my review) wakes up, lying naked in a shower inside a very posh looking bathroom. Alice has no idea who she is or what she is doing there as she has total memory loss. Alice explores her surroundings, she leaves the bathroom and discovers she is in a large, and seemingly deserted mansion. She sees a note that says 'Today all your dreams come true'. Alice finds some rather fetching clothes, a long sexy red dress and a pair of knee high leather boots. A heavily armed elite squad of soldiers, Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), Chad Kaplan (Martin Crewes), J.D Salinas (Pasquale Aleardi) plus two more whose names are never mentioned (Torsten Jerabek and Marc Logan-Black) burst in through the windows, hey what was wrong with the doors guys? The one in command (Colin Salmon, like Milla his characters name is never mentioned during the film) seems to know Alice. Along with a mysterious man who claims to be a cop called Matt Addison (Eric Mabius) they all get on-board a train and find yet another survivor named Spence Parks (James Purefoy) who also has memory loss like Alice. They all travel on the train deep underground to the 'Hive'. The soldiers explain that the 'Hive' is located under Racoon City being half a mile underground at it's deepest point. It is a top secret research facility owned and operated by the Umbrella Corp. and houses over 500 scientists, technicians and support staff. The 'Hive' is controlled by 'Red Queen', state of the art artificial intelligence that takes on the holographic appearance of the lead programmers daughter (Michaela Dicker). They say they are there on a search and rescue mission as 'Red Queen' went homicidal and killed everyone inside the 'Hive', to try and find out what happened and to destroy 'Red Queen' if necessary. Things don't go according to plan however. There may be a traitor in the group, and a horde of flesh eating zombie office workers created by the Umbrella Corp. developed 'T-Virus' which is what all the fuss is about doesn't help their cause. Nor does the fact that in an hour the 'Hive' will be sealed, permanently with them still inside to stop any potential outside contamination! Will they all make it out in time? Can they put an end to the Umbrella Corp. research and deadly 'T-Virus' it has created and contain it so not to let it spread outside and infect millions of people? Written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson I think playing the game is ultimately more fun and rewarding. All the best ideas in this are taken from the game, the rest come from Aliens (1986) which this film resembles strongly. The script, to it's credit, moves along like a rocket and tries to add some twists here and there but for the most part they are fairly easy to see coming and not surprising. At least it's never dull or boring. I found the horror elements extremely disappointing, the zombies don't turn up until over half way through the film and there is virtually no blood or gore in it at all, apart from a CGI decapitation with no blood. I did like the skinless dogs, but they were taken directly from the game though. As was the big monster at the end which was also quite cool, if a little fake looking. A decent amount of gore would have helped this film no end, the potential was there with zombies Vs heavily armed soldiers but no, just a few bullet hits and that's it. The zombies don't eat anyone either. The action elements are also average at best, a few CGI enhanced fights and a couple of sequences that try to be exciting but generally aren't. I would have preferred the filmmakers to have more of it set in the Gothic cool looking mansion rather than the high-tech labs and offices as it would have given the whole film a much creepier atmosphere. Acting is OK for this type of thing but no-one is going to win an Oscar, and Milla Jovovich is a real babe in that dress and those boots as she kicks but. Everyone else involved has to deal with standard horror stereotypes and clichés. It's not a bad film I suppose as it's well made moves along a nice pace and entertains to an extent but it could have been so much more in the hands of someone with talent and imagination. Resident Evil plays like a cross between the game and Aliens, if the sound of that appeals to you you may like it otherwise you probably won't. Average, but worth a watch none the less.",5,1,4,18 January 2005
The Butterfly Effect," Better than you may expect.
","The Butterfly Effect starts as seven year old Evan (Logan Lerman) suffers from strange black-outs just like his institutionalised father Jason (Callum Keith Rennie), his friend Kayleigh's (Sarah Widdows) father forces the two to engage in a paedophile video & he abuses both Kayleigh & her brother Tommy. Six years later & the three decide to play a prank on a woman by making Lenny put some dynamite in a mail box, unfortunately the prank goes terribly wrong & a woman & her baby daughter dies in the explosion. Things go from bad to worse as guilt tears the four friends apart, eventually Evan & his mom leave the area. Seven years later & Evan (Ashton Kutcher) goes to college & is studying human memory & uses his own experiences to aid him, while reading from one of his childhood journals Evan travels back in time to relive the point during which he had a black-out & discovers that he is able to change the future. However while trying to create the perfect future for himself & his friends he only succeeds in making things worse...Written & directed by Eric Bress & J. Mackye Gruber this is an odd little film that sort of defies explanation or any attempt to pigeon hole it as it's unlike any other film I have seen or heard about. Originally released as a 110 minute film a 'Director's Cut' was subsequently released on home video which is longer & most notably changes the ending, while I will be basing my comment on the theatrical version I have actually seen the alternate ending & although slightly darker in tone & not as 'happy' I don't think it makes a massive difference & could come across as a bit silly too with an unborn foetus committing suicide a bit much. Anyway, the film is a surprising mix of sci-fi, drama, romance & thriller with heavy emphasis on the drama. You could say that The Butterfly Effect is a darker variation on the romantic time travel/alternate time-line comedy Sliding Doors (1998) but with a much more gritty & downbeat tone as every successive attempt Evan makes to try & change the future for the better makes thing worse for himself &/or his friends. The film is a little slow going at places & the changing time-line plot gets a bit old by the fourth or fifth time it's used, in the end though I suppose the point that The Butterfly Effect is trying to make & the one which Evan finally realises is that once you change something you can never go back to the way things were before & in a nutshell that's what the film is about. The ending is also quite poignant as Evan realise the problem isn't anyone or anything else, it's himself & the only way to rectify things is to distance himself from everyone he has ever cared for & it's these dramatic revelations that the film with either sink or swim for you, if you find the plot compelling & the character's engaging then there's a fair chance you will enjoy this.Not much, if any, explanation is given to the actual time travel process here which may be an issue for some but the plot & character's are both strong enough in my opinion to sustain ones attention. The butterfly effect itself obviously is a reference to the chaos theory & that the flap of a butterfly's wings on one side of the world can cause a hurricane on the other. More of a drama with sci-fi elements there no real effects scenes or anything that violent. The film playing at the cinema is Se7en (1995) & the odd clip is seen.With a supposed budget of about $13,000,000 this was shot in Canada this was one of the most read unproduced scripts doing the rounds in Hollywood & it took the presence of Kutcher to get the thing made. The acting is alright but nothing special & this is the type of film where it needs to be great & not just alright.The Butterfly Effect requires you to put some effort in watching it & while it can come across as a somewhat dull drama at times there's enough going on to warrant a watch. Followed by The Butterfly Effect 2 (2006) & The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations (2009).",6,4,7,30 December 2009
Alien vs. Predator," Urgh, how to kill not one but two franchise's at the same time...
","AVP: Alien vs. Predator is set in the year 2004 as one of rich industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland's (Lance Henriksen) orbiting satellites picks up a heat bloom under the surface of Antartica where further satellite imaging reveals an ancient pyramid structure buried deep under the ice. Before you can say 'how did it get there' Weyland has assembled a crack team of experts, has sailed out to the location & made their way into the mysterious pyramid. Inside the pyramid it seems to come alive & starts to rearrange itself at regular intervals, meanwhile a bunch of Predators have also entered the pyramid for a bit of sport, no not Weyland & his team but the the newly released alien creatures that provide much more of a challenge...This American, Canadian, British, German & Czech co-production was written & directed Paul W.S. Anderson I have to say I have little love for AVP: Alien vs. Predator & think it's a pretty crappy film that has potentially destroyed two strong sci-fi/horror franchises all by it's own. The stupid & predictable script is terrible on many, many levels. For a start the human character's are awful, they die far too quickly & the only one who survives has to be the single worst character from a film made during 2004. I wouldn't have minded any other character surviving but her, the very fact she survived meant I didn't like this. Then there's the main reason why I wanted to see this film, the Predators & Aliens themselves. I have to say I was very disappointed again, if the basic story wasn't bad enough the filmmakers have turned the Predators into some sort of good guy while the Aliens are considered the evil ones although the Aliens themselves only do what comes naturally & what it takes for them to survive as a species, I mean they didn't invade the Earth did they? They were put there by the Predators to hunt so in fact I'd say the Predators should have been seen as the bad guy's because they are technologically advanced, free thinking & can make a conscience decision not to randomly kill & potentially wipe out an entire planet by infesting it with Aliens. The way the Predator & that awful woman teamed up at the end to defeat the Aleins was toe curlingly embarrassingly bad & the single worst plot device in any previous Alien or Predator film. To be fair to it the film moves along at a fair pace, it's not too boring & it provides a certain amount of stupid, moronic badly written entertainment but I just thought it was a really lousy film saved only by the presence of the Aliens & Predators themselves.Director Anderson does alright but I didn't think the film was scary or exciting, it plods along at a decent pace but it's utterly predictable & some of the bits in it are really bad & just lessen both franchises. The first fight between an Alien & predator has great effects but it looks like some sort of horrible wrestling match as the Predator swings the Alien around & slams it into walls, I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing. I hated the ending, I hated the lone surviving human cast member (how was she able to stand in the middle of a literally freezing Antartica at the end wearing just a sweatshirt & not even get the shivers?) & I hated that the Aliens (my personal favourite monster between an Alien & Predator) were treated as something that had to be exterminated just because they existed. The special effects are very good & I loved the opening shot which resembled a silhouette of the Queen alien from Aliens (1986) but in fact turns out to be a satellite, there are other little homages to both sets of films throughout. The gore levels are none existent, this is PG rated kiddie fodder all the way.With a modest sounding $45,000,000 (by Hollywood blockbuster standards anyway) this is well with good production values & great special effects. Apparently shot in just two & a half months in Prague in the Czech Republic. The whole film is a little too dark for my liking & is a bit dull to watch. The acting was awful especially Sanaa Lathan the female hero who I just thought was terrible in every way.AVP: Alien vs. Predator is alright if your after some fast moving sci-fi/horror entertainment & don't care about little things like story or character's, those who demand a bit more from their films (even lowbrow sci-fi horror junk) then I suggest you give this turkey a miss. Remember the good times & watch Aliens & the original Predator (1987) again instead. Followed by Alien vs. Predator: Requiem (2007) which judging by it's plot outline sounds even worse than this if that's at all possible.",4,0,4,4 September 2007
District 9," Surprisingly quite good.
","District 9 is set in Johannesburg in South Africa where a huge alien mother ship hovers above the city, after entering the ship which seems unable to leave a million alien creatures are discovered & brought down to Earth & kept in a slum like area known as District 9. Human feeling against the aliens which become nicknamed Prawns grow in the city & the Government hire an outside security company named MNU, or the Multi National United, to evict the alien Prawns & move them outside the city limits away from the human population into another slum like camp. The sheepish Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Coley) is put in charge of the operation, while trying to move some Prawns from their shack Wikus is sprayed in the face by some black fluid hidden by the Prawns & soon begins to undergo a change, his arm starts to turn into an alien claw & his whole DNA structure begins to change. The men in power want Wikus because he can operate the alien weaponry which relies on alien DNA to activate it but the aliens want the fluid back so they can go back home while all Wikus wants to be be human again...This American, New Zealand, Canadian & South African co-production was co-written & directed by Neill Blomkamp & was a big success when it was released, a somewhat surprise success too since District 9 as has already been said is the complete opposite of what Hollywood suits appear to think what is required to be successful. The fact that it has no big names, it has no-one attached with any proved track record, it has a first time director, a leading actor who has never been in a full length film before, it is set completely outside the US with all the actor's speaking in foreign accents & it deals with moral issues in a thoughtful yet still entertaining way. The simple fact that District 9 is a good film probably had a lot to do with it though, & to be fair I think it is although it's maybe not the classic that some make it out to be. From the big budget sci-fi action blockbuster angle there's plenty of aliens, explosions, fights & action to satisfy that section of the audience although it's not perfect like if that alien could operate the mother ship at the end why couldn't it at the start before they were all placed in District 9? How could it have kept that spaceship concealed under his shack? Where did all the alien weapons come from? The alien don't seem particularly intelligent enough to have created all that technology so where did it come from? However District 9 has obvious parallels to real world events, in fact writer & director Blomkamp has said that District 9 was inspired by his time in South Africa during apartheid & you can easily replace the alien Prawns with many ethnic minorities now that face persecution in certain parts of the world & the script does a good job of making the situation & events as they unfold seem fairly believable & credible. At just under two hours long the film flew by & I was quite emerged in the story.Filmed in large parts like a documentary complete with interviews & such District 9 has a sort of new report feel to it, luckily Blomkamp decides to keep the shaky hand-held camcorder crap to a minimum & you can always tells what's going on. Add that to security camera style footage & additional Hollywood set-pieces & District 9 has a unique yet natural feel to ti that works surprisingly well & is never too distracting. The CGI computer effects are very good actually, from the aliens themselves to the huge mother ship constantly hovering above the city to the robotic suit that Wikus wear at the end. A full length feature film remake of the Niell Blomkamp short Alive in Joburg (2006).With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this had decent money spent on it & I though it was a lower budgeted independent film rather than a big studio one. Actually film in Johannesburg in South Africa. Although District 9 was nominated for four Oscars back in 2010 it didn't win any of them. The acting is very good from all involved.District 9 is a great sci-fi action thriller with obvious real life political & social parallels & while it's not perfect it's a good way to pass a couple of hours. Better than I had expected for sure.",6,5,7,5 June 2012
The Princess Bride," Charming little fantasy adventure.
","The Princess Bride starts as a Grandfather (Peter Falk) visits his ill Grandson (Fred Savage) & decides to read him a classic fairytale, he opens the book & begins to read the story... In the kingdom of Florin a farm-boy named Westley (Cary Elwes) & his boss Buttercup (Robin Wright) fall deeply in love with each other, Westley leaves & Buttercup receives word that he has been killed by the dread pirate Roberts. Five years later & Buttercup is engaged to be married to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) even though she has no love for him, shortly before the marriage Buttercup is kidnapped by a man named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) who then sets sail for the kingdom of Guilder where he plans to kill Buttercup in order to start a war between Guilder & Florin but Buttercup is saved by whom she thinks is the dread pirate Roberts with Prince Humperdinck & his army close behind...Produced & directed by Rob Reiner this was written by William Goldman based on his 1973 novel of the same name, while not drastically different I haven't read the book so cannot compare the two but I really enjoyed the film on many levels for it's action, it's adventure, it cuteness & sense of humour. There's a neat wraparound story in which peter Falk tells the story of The Princess Bride to his young grandson & there are several amusing moments in which we cut back to the pair who make several comments, the sort of comments that a young boy might make while listening to an old fashioned fairytale but it's also nice to see him become engrossed & caught up in the story like anyone watching The Princess Bride will, the point that mere words on a page can captivate as much as a computer game is well made. I would call The Princess Bride itself more of a swashbuckling adventure adventure yarn rather than a straight fairytale, for some reason the fantasy elements are downplayed quite a lot with only giant Rats & Westley being brought back to life (if he was dead anyway which is never made totally clear) the only fantasy aspects. The Princess Bride seems more interested in amusing one-liners, sharp, witty dialogue & sword fight action which is fine as it all adds up to a throughly enjoyable light hearted fantasy romance. In fact the main aspect that The Princess Bride lifts from the average fairytale is the idea of true love conquers all, it's a strong & constant theme throughout thankfully without ever getting to mushy or sentimental. The Princess Bride manages almost perfectly to balance seriousness & parody with an assortment of wonderfully drawn character's all of whom have great personality & some great moments. At just over an hour & a half the film never lacks pace & keeps moving all the time, it's easy to see why the young Fred Savage gets so engrossed in The Princess Bride & I am sure most viewers will feel exactly the same way.As I mentioned earlier I am a bit disappointed at the lack of overt fantasy elements, even the settings & locations from woods & ancient Castles look a little drab. The ROUS (Rodents of Unusual Size) are dwarf actor's in Rat suits which look a little tatty but at least they have fluid movement & still look better than a modern CGI computer effect probably would. There are some great fencing & sword fighting scenes, some of the best you will ever see to be fair as th makers don't seem to go for historic accuracy or realism & just go to town with various stunts & improbable gymnastics.With a supposed budget of about $16,000,000 the production values are good & it looks nice enough having been mostly filmed on location here in England. The acting is good, Cary Elwes as the smooth, handsome & likable Westley shines although Robin Wright is a little flat in comparison. Billy Crystal, Mel Smith & Peter Cook all have comedic roles.The Princess Bride is a highly entertaining & witty play on the old fairytale clichés that is a cracking action adventure film in it's own right. What's not like? I thought it was clever & humorous & heartfelt & exciting. Definitely recommended.",7,2,3,5 February 2011
The Transporter," Enjoyable action film.
","The Transporter is set in Marseille in France where ex-military man Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is known to the criminal underworld as a 'Transporter', a man who who can act as a getaway driver or deliver an illegal cargo from one place to another. Frank accepts a job to transport a bag across France, on the way to his destination Frank gets a flat tyre & has to get the spare from the boot & notices that the bag is moving. Curious Frank takes a look inside the bag & sees a Chinese woman named Lai (Qi Shu), Frank delivers the cargo to the destination & gangster Wall Street (Matt Schulze) gives Frank a suitcase to take back with him but it turns out it's packed with explosive & blows Frank's car up while he is inside a roadside café. Wall Street wants Frank dead & sets out to kill him while Frank reluctantly rescues Lai who tells him of an operation to smuggle hundreds of Chinese through Marseille...This French American co-production was directed by Louis Leterrier & Cory Yuen & is a fun & energetic light hearted action film that could be described as a sort of cross between James Bond & Die Hard which has already been said about The Transporter franchise as a whole before, I must admit I did actually quite enjoy The Transporter for what it was. The script isn't the best with several poorly thought out moments like when one moment we see the kidnapped Lai is tied to a chair & then the next she's in the back of a car that Frank steals still tied to a chair. I mean how did she open the car door? How did she get in the car tied to a chair? How does a chair even fit inside the back of a car? How did she close the door once she was inside? How did Frank not notice a fully grown woman tied to a chair in the back of a car he just got in? Why did they kidnap Lai anyway? Why did they hire Frank to take her to that Château? Why is she free to do anything she wants at the end? What happened to the second truck full of Chinese at the end? How did Lai's father get to the truck Frank was driving so quickly? How did Lai get the gun off the Chinese gangster when we clearly hear her scream? Some sloppy writing & plotting hurts the film (alos, tellingly only four character's in the entire film are given names) but on the positive side The Transporter is quite likable, the main character played by Statham is likable & although his forced relationship with Lai seems clunky they make a nice couple & have a certain on screen spark, the bad guy's are alright if a little faceless & generic while the good natured cop has his moments. At a shade under 90 minutes at least it's short & moves along at breakneck pace, your never too far from something blowing up, a gun being fired or a fight scene which is definitely a good thing.To be honest where The Transporter excels are it's action scenes which are great, from car chases to exploding houses to shoot-outs to imaginative fight scenes that have an air of Jackie Chan about them as Statham pulls out all the moves & uses various random objects to help him like his jumper or barrels of oil. Thankfully there's none of that horrible quick editing, everything here is well photographed & it's clear to see what's going on, who everyone is & where they are in fight scenes. The car chases are cool too although I wish they had used the huge trucks at the end a bit more. The ending itself is a bit of a let down with a brief stand-off & a rushed final few minutes that would have benefited from better send-offs for the villains. A word also goes for the French locations which are really nice, shot mainly in bright daylight the locations look really nice.Filmed in France the production values are good, there's a lack of CGI computer effects & to my eye most of the stunts were real time stunts performed on set which helps the look of the film enormously. The acting is fine, Jason Statham was made for roles like this where he plays a likable action hero & he's pretty good here while Qi Shu is attractive as the love interest.The Transporter is a fun & enjoyable action comedy with energetic fight scenes & some cool explosions & car chases, Statham is likable as the hero & despite some poor writing I liked it for what it was. Not a masterpiece by any means but an enjoyable way to spend 88 minutes. Followed by Transporter 2 (2005) & Transporter 3 (2008) both of which drop the 'The' from the title.",6,1,3,1 May 2010
28 Days Later...," Dull horror.
","28 Days Later... starts as three animal activists break into 'Cambridge Primate Research Center' & deliberately set loose some caged monkeys, unfortunately unknown to them these monkeys are infected with a highly contagious 'rage' virus which turns the carrier into a ravenous crazy red-eyed zombies... Jump forward '28 Days Later' & Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital bed from a coma, he discovers the hospital & central London completely deserted. Jim is attacked by some of the infected & is saved by Mark (Noah Huntley) & Selena (Naomie Harris) who inform Jim that the entire country has been overrun by infected people who do nothing but kill & spread the virus. Survival is hard & Mark is killed when he becomes infected, with just Jim & Selena left they meet a man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) & his young daughter Hannah (Megan Burns) who are also having trouble surviving in London. While trying to listen to the radio they hear a message from a group of soldiers just outside Manchester, the four decide to try & find them & seek help & shelter...This English French co-production was directed by Danny Boyle & I thought it was OK at best & excruciatingly dull at worst. The script by Alex Garland takes itself 100% seriously & is slow, isn't properly fleshed out & dull. The film felt like it was hours long & it took me three attempts to get through it over two days as it just wasn't holding my interest at all. I hated all the character's, I hated way it was shot, I hated the story & I hated the fact it rips off so many better horror films right down to individual scenes from the likes of The Day of the Trffids (1962) where Jim wakes up in hospital facing a post apocalyptic world, Dawn of the Dead (1978) with the shopping center bit & the zombie kid & Day of the Dead (1985) with the chained up zombie, there are loads more besides. Not enough information about the virus or zombie sis given, in fact we learn virtually nothing about either. The film failed to excite me on any level, I simply didn't care what happened which is why I wasn't bothered about seeing it in one go. For most of the film Jim is passive & rather static until the end when he suddenly turns into a bare chested superhero & takes out an entire army platoon on his own & avoids all the infected zombies running around everywhere, it's far too clichéd & is just a totally unconvincing change in his character. The happy 'Hollywood' ending is also hard to swallow, where exactly did that plane come from? It's only Britian that is infected? It states early in the film that the virus had spread to Paris & New York, if the rest of the world was still 'OK' I cannot believe for the life of me that a highly trained platoon of soldiers wouldn't have radio equipment to contact the outside world, I mean if my cheap mobile can call the opposite side of the world surely they had the equipment to radio for help or at least know that other countries were infection free. After the end credits had finished on the version I saw it said 'What If...' which turns out to be an alternative ending in which Selena & Hannah try to save Jim's life in a hospital but fail & just walk off, this is a slightly more realistic downbeat ending that some may prefer while other's may not. Having said that it's well made & it's watchable on a basic level but it could have been so much better.Director Boyle does his best to ruin the thing, it was shot on a digital camera so it looks grubby & cheap while he totally messes up the horror scenes, why do directors use really fast cuts? You know the sort of thing, scenes which are just annoying hand-held jerky camera movements, a jumble of jump cuts & individual shots that last for less then a second which confuses, frustrates & doesn't allow the audience to see anything. A lot of films are guilty of it & I really don't know why, I don't know a single person who says they like this particular editing technique, not one so why filmmakers continue to use it in abundance I'll never know. Forget about any effective gore as it's blink & you'll miss it stuff because of the fast editing, the most you can make out is some spurting blood. The early scenes set in a deserted London have a certain effective eeriness to them but that's as good as 28 days Later... gets.With a supposed budget of about $8,000,000 28 Days Later... is well made for what it is but it's not that stylish. The acting from a largely unknown cast is OK but I absolutely hated all the character's in the thing which made it impossible to like the film or care about them.28 Days Later... was hugely disappointing, I was expecting a lot but I felt let down in every area. I will still give it a decent score as it's OK but there are just too many things about it I didn't like. Worth a watch but just don't expect a masterpiece.",6,5,14,16 May 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," 'Let's get this movable feast underway.' Decent enough sequel.
","The Lost World: Jurassic Park starts as Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) visits eccentric billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) for the first time in four years since the events of the original Jurassic Park (1993) which were covered up, John tells Ian that besides the island in the original there was a 'site B' where the Dinosaurs were born. He is organising an expedition to the island to document the Dinosaurs there & to try to save them from his money grabbing nephew who now controls the company InGen. At first Ian refuses but once he learns his girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is involved he's in, along with photographer Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) & filmmaker Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) they all travel to the island. However they are soon joined by Hammond's nephew, a big game hunter named Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite) & a load of heavily armed men who are there to collect some Dinosaurs in an attempt to resurrect the idea of a Dinosaur zoo this time in San Diego...Directed by Steven Spielberg The Lost World: Jurassic Park is the follow up to Spielberg's phenomenal monster box-office hit Jurassic Park & isn't as good as the original but is still a decent & perfectly entertaining effort. The script by David Koepp & was based on the novel 'The Lost World' by Michael Crichton which I haven't read but the two apparently share little in the way of similarity. The thing that hurts The Lost World: Jurassic Park in my opinion is that the script is so loose, it has little focus & relies on nothing more than another group of scientists & people who want to exploit the Dinosaurs having lots of coincidence's conspire against them which leaves them all trapped on an island with loads of killer Dinosaurs for company. It feels very similar to the original but somehow even less, there's nothing of any substance, there's nothing that drives the story forward & Spielberg gives us yet another highly annoying kid, the scene where she kills the Raptor was easily the worst part of the film for me. I hate annoying kids! The character's are OK but Postlethwaite's hunter character is all tough to start with but by the time the film finishes he's repented! He should have been the main villain, instead they turned him into a bleeding heart liberal who gets dumped from the film totally about 20 minutes before the end never to be seen again. I sill thought it was decent, it moves along at a nice pace & the climax where the T-Rex stomps it's way through San Diego is cool even though it feels like it's been edited in from a completely different film.Director Spielberg does a good job, the special effects are top-drawer as one would expect & there's some great moments. Whenever the T-Rex's are on screen the films pretty cool, the climax in San Diego is a great sequence as is the part where the truck gets pushed over the cliff & everyone is left dangling inside. There's a few effective scare moments & the set-pieces are very good. There's a touch of gore with people being eaten, there's a severed hand, someone is bitten in two & a couple more scenes which may not be suitable for the youngest of viewers.With a supposed budget of about $73,000,000 & it made nearly $93,000,000 on it's opening weekend, technically it's top-notch & is as well made as anything out there with plenty of big budget Hollywood polish. The acting was OK with Goldblum standing out, I won't mention the annoying kid. Oh sorry, I just did.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a decent sequel, I liked it & think it makes for good entertainment. It's well worth a watch but maybe it's not the film it could have been.",7,2,5,28 December 2006
Ghost Rider," Enjoyable comic book adaptation.
","Ghost Rider starts as the teenage daredevil motorbike stunt rider Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) discovers that his father Barton Blaze (Brett Cullen) is suffering from incurable cancer, a complete stranger named Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) offers Johnny a deal that will cure his father of cancer. In return for his father's health Mephistopheles who is in fact the devil wants Johnny's soul, Johnny agrees & signs a contract. The very next day & Johnny's father is cured but dies in a motorbike accident later that morning, devastated Johnny dumps his girlfriend Roxanne (Raquel Alessi) & goes it alone. Years later & the adult Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) is now a motorbike daredevil superstar & travels the country risking life & limb in ever increasingly dangerous stunts. Meanwhile Mephistopheles son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) wants to rule the world & goes in search of the Contract of San Venganza which contains the soul's of the hundred most evil people that ever lived which will give him the power to do so but Mephistopheles calls in on the deal he made with Jonny & turns him into the Ghost Rider, a powerful supernatural bounty hunter with flaming skull...This American & Australian co-production was written & directed by Mark Steven Johnson who previously made the lacklustre Marvel comic book superhero film Daredevil (2003), here Johnson turns in a much more enjoyable comic book film that has quite a bit going for it. Available in both it's original theatrical version & an extended cut which adds about fifteen minutes of character development (notably Johnny Blaze's father & Sam Elliott's character) which probably fleshes things out a bit more, while I saw the theatrical cut when it was originally released many years ago I will be basing my comments on the extended version which I saw last night. While there is nothing outstanding about Ghost Rider as far as silly comic book films go I did actually quite enjoy it, there's just enough story to keep you interested & there are plenty of cool moments that are fun. Johnny Blaze's first transformation in the Ghost Rider takes nearly forty minutes but it's worth it as the Ghost Rider is a cool character, maybe a little silly looking at times but cool none the less. I loved the shots of him speeding along on his motorbike with it's front & back wheels on fire leaving a huge trail of flame in it's wake for instance. The plot is alright, the script seems to try & incorporate parts of the Ghost Rider mythology & I am sure fans will be fairly happy with the continuity here. The character's are OK, the supernatural plot about demons from hell taking over the world is standard stuff & not that original but it's a decent enough excuse to have Ghost Rider ride around looking cool. OK, so I enjoyed Ghost Rider more of a visual spectacle than as a coherent engaging film with a deep story but sometimes it's good to just sit back, relax & have a bit of fun watching a silly film such as Ghost Rider.Although many may not agree I actually enjoyed Ghost Rider as much as any of the other recent spate of big budget comic book films such as X-Men (2000), Spider-Man (2002), Hulk (2003), Elektra (2005), Fantastic Four (2005) & Iron Man (2008) as well as numerous associated sequels. I think Ghost Rider with his exposed flaming skull looks cool & the scenes as he rides his bike are very cool, from riding on water to sitting on top of a bridge to the spectacular scene as he rides up on side of a skyscraper & down the other while finding time to stop & fight a helicopter & kill a fallen angel between! The CGI computer effects are quite good here, some of the morph effects look a bit cheap & trying to make a man with a burning skull for a head look realistic was always going to be difficult but generally there are no really bad effects here.With a supposed budget of about $110,000,000 no expense was spared, Ghost Rider is a great looking film & has the glossy Hollywood production values you would expect. Filmed in Australia with some re-shoots in Canada. The acting is alright, Nicolas Cage is alright but he's not the greatest actor while Eva Mendes looks nice but does little else. Veterans Peter Fonda & Sam Elliott provide good support.Ghost Rider is a comic book superhero film that I liked more than I thought I would (& remember the theatrical version being), sure it's not high art or going to change the world but as a daft superhero who has a flaming skull for a head this is maybe about as enjoyable as it could have been. There's just enough plot, there's just enough action & plenty of cool visuals to make Ghsot Rider far less painful to watch than it could have been & what I was expecting it to be. A sequel, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012) is currently in production.",5,0,2,23 February 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," Reasonable big budget comic book superhero Hollywood blockbuster.
","X-Men: The Last Stand starts as it is revealed that a company called Worthington Labs have developed a cure for the mutant gene that almost instantly turns a mutant into just another 'normal' person. The cure is seen by the majority of the mutant community as an attempt to eradicate them from the planet, in particular Magneto (Ian McKellan) forms a mutant army to seize control of the cure & destroy it. Meanwhile the distraught Cyclops (James Marsden) visits the lake where Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) died & is amazed to see her resurrection from the watery depths, unfortunately she kills him by accident. Unsure of who she has become Jean hides away but Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) finds her & tries to talk with her, she kills him too. Seeing her almost limitless power Magneto convinces Jean to side with him in the war against us humans & the cure, it's up to Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry) & the other minor X-Men to save the day... again...This American English co-production is also known simply as X3 & was the third film in the X-Men franchise, one of the most successful of all the Marvel comic book to screen adaptations with the original X-Men (2000) film helped kick-off the trend by Hollywood studios to plunder comic books & turn them into live-action CGI packed big budget summer blockbusters that have generally proved very popular at the box-office with paying audiences. Directed by Brett Ratner I watched X-Men: The Last Stand yesterday & while I didn't think it was brilliant I thought it was entertaining enough for what it is, having said that I generally don't like films adapted from comic books since by their very nature these sorts of character's with these sorts of special powers & silly costumes work far better in 2D on a page rather than in 3D on a cinema screen. Still, at least it's fairly short, the pace is decent, there's a few good action scenes with some impressive CGI computer effects & I would think most X-Men fans would be happy with it although I admit I have never read an X-Men comic book before so I can't really say how faithful this is to the character's origins. As a film it's alright although the first half is mostly concerned with small sub-plots like the cure, the politicians son being cured, like Jean Grey coming back to life, like Magneto finding some new henchmen & there's even a couple of minor love triangles as well. At some points it's like the makers were trying to turn the X-Men into some sort of soap opera but it does come together for the final forty odd minutes & a big budget action scene as mutant fight mutant & the X-Men inevitably save the day. Certainly worth a watch if your a fan of the X-Men character's, the franchise so far or comic book adaptations in general.The film looks nice enough, there are some very impressive special effects sequences with the bending & moving of the Golden Gate Bridge by Magneto probably the stand-out moment. There all all sorts of mutants & X-Men character's from the comic books here but not being a fan I don't really know if they are faithful representations or not. Originally to be directed by Bryan Singer, then Matthew Vaughn who both quit for various reasons Ratner took over & the whole production was apparently quite rushed. The story for X-Men: The Last Stand is apparently a combination of two X-Men graphic novels, Gifted by Joss Whedon & The Dark Phoenix Saga by Chris Claremont & John Byrne.With a supposed budget of about $210,000,000 surely this has to be one of the most expensive films ever made, amazingly it was a success & made over $122,000,000 on it's opening memorial day weekend. Filmed largely in Vancouver in Canada. The cast do alright although many will be familiar with the character's as they return from the previous films while Vinnie Jones makes an appearance as Juggernaunt & an almost unrecognisable Kelsey Grammar makes his debut as Beast.X-Men: The Last Stand is a decent enough big budget comic book superhero film that entertains & passes 100 odd minutes harmlessly enough, I can't say I loved it but I didn't hate it either. Certainly worth a watch especially if your a fan of the character's or the genre.",5,3,3,26 January 2009
Hellboy," Very enjoyable comic book hero adaptation thing.
","Hellboy starts in 1944 off the coast of Scotland where some evil Nazi's are conducting experiments in the black arts to try & tip the war in the favour of Hitler, with the help of Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden) who tries to open a portal way to hell in order to unleash demons from another dimension. However Professor Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm (John Hurt) & allied forces manage to stop them but not before a small red boy like creature enters our world through the portal, this small red creature grows up to become Hellboy (Ron Pearlman) who now works for the US Government in a secret organisation called the Bureau for Paranormal Research & Defense who monitor & combat supernatural & demonic threats to the Earth. Upon investigating a monster at a museum the team find out that Grigori is back & intends to destroy the world by reopening the portal & finishing what he started in 1944...Written & directed by Guillermo del Toro one has to say I think Hellboy is easily one of the, if not the best comic book adaptation of the recent CGI computer effects stuffed years. First of all Hellboy is one of those frustrating films which is available in it's original theatrical version & a 'director's cut', now I know Hellboy wasn't the first & won't be the last but I am sick of Hollywood studios treating us film fans like idiots & trying to milk as much money out of us as possible. Why two different versions? The director's cut only adds 10 minutes to a film which lasts over two hours anyway so the differences aren't likely to be significant, it just annoys me that studios are so cynical in knowing that the fans want the best version & will probably end up buying both & the studio ends up making more money from us, true film fans. Anyway, rant over. The character of Hellboy originally appeared in a series of Dark Horse graphic novel books & was created by Mike Mingola, with the success of other comic book adaptations like Spider-Man (2002) in particular the powers that be decided to make a Hellboy film & a fine film it is too. Even though it lasts for two hours it didn't feel that long, it moves along at a really good pace & your never too far away from a monster, a fight, an explosion or some other action set-piece. Also another factor which makes Hellboy work so well is that it's fun, it doesn't take itself too seriously & it just wants to entertain you which as far as I'm concerned it did in style. The character's are surprisingly good, Hellboy himself is pretty likable although one has to say beyond all the flashy effects, the action & the unique central character there's not that much else here, there certainly isn't much of a story to get involved in. Keep watching after the end credits start, once the big orange ones finish we discover that the makers hadn't forget Manning after all, it doesn't really say what happens to him but at least he gets a mention.Director del Toro made Hellboy straight after another comic book flick Balde II (2002) which is actually a better film than Hellboy because it's darker & has more of a story. Here del Toro was obviously under instruction to turn in a PG rated family film & therefore it's relatively restrained in the violence department. I will say that the film looks gorgeous though, the wonderful high tech sets of the bureau to the dark & dirty New York sewer system to the wonderful looking Gothic castles when the film switches to Russia to the costumes & in particular the Nazi assassin Kroenen with his sleek black metal mask & blades which shoot out of his sleeves. Hellboy looks fabulous in more ways than one because Hellboy the film looks great as does Hellboy the character brought to life by Rick Baker & his team as they applied the make-up to Pearlman which took fours hours everyday. The CGI computer effects also look brilliant, when done poorly CGI effects look awful but when done properly they are simply amazing & Hellboy is a good case in point, from monsters with swaying tentacles to explosions the CGI is top notch.With a supposed budget of about $66,000,000 Hellboy's budget was probably kept down due to the fact there weren't any really big stars in it demanding a $10,000,000 plus pay-cheque, I'd imagine most of that money actually ended up on screen & it shows because Hellboy does look the business. Surprisingly shot in Prague in the Czech Republic although actually set in America, Russia & Scotland. The acting is good but most of the human cast are given little to do, Pearlman steals the show here.Hellboy is a really fun, action & CGI computer effects packed comic book hero adaptation which in my humble opinion is maybe the best of the recent superhero films & better than Spider-Man at any rate. A must for fantasy film fans & fans of the graphic novels, very enjoyable on a big dumb loud noisy fun type of level. Look out for the forthcoming sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008).",7,2,3,29 November 2007
I Am Legend," Not too bad at all.
","I Am Legend is set in the near future where Lieutenant Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the last man alive in New York City, some years previous a cure for cancer designed by scientist Dr. Krippen (an uncredited Emma Thompson) mutated into a deadly airborne virus that has wiped most of humanity out. The only people left are either those few who are immune like Neville or those who have been transformed into zombie like creatures who feed on flesh & blood, seemingly alone in the world Neville scrapes out an existence as he tries to find an antidote for the virus & save humanity from being wiped out completely...Directed by Francis Lawrence this was the big Hollywood blockbuster for Christmas 2007, I must admit I liked it more than I thought I was going to but the ending spoiled it for me after an impressive opening two thirds. The script by Mark Protosevich & producer Akvia Goldsman was based on the 1954 novel of the same name by Richard Matheson & is the third time the book has been adapted into a feature film along with The Last Man on Earth (1964) & The Omega Man (1971) neither of which I have seen, anyway back to I Am Legend & there are significant changes to the original source material including the ending which I will get to in good time. I have to say that I enjoyed I Am Legend more than I though I would & it isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination but after a wonderfully atmospheric opening two thirds where Will Smith spends his day wasting time & having fun in a deserted New York & dodging zombies at night. In that respect it felt like a much bigger scale Dawn of the Dead (1978) which is no bad thing at all but then the woman & her kid show's up at which point it goes downhill, ignores the original book by Matheson & ends in a overly sentimental happy ending, the woman & kid are used to further the plot rather than enhance it in my opinion. Most of the story unfolds via Neville's personal blog & a few flashbacks, it gives little bits of information at a time which keeps the plot going. At less than 100 minutes (does anyone actually sit through all the end credits?) it moves along at a nice pace, it's never what you would call boring & it tells a reasonable story well enough. I Am Legend is pretty much a one character film & it lives or dies by the fact if you like Neville or not, luckily Will Smith does a good job of giving him personality & the writing is solid too.Director Lawrence does a fine job here, some of the shot's of a deserted overgrown New York look spectacular. There's a real sense of atmosphere, isolation & helplessness as Will Smith searches for a cure. The zombies look like those from 28 Days/Weeks Later as they run around like they are on steroids screaming their heads off, the main problem I have with them is that they are all entirely CGI computer effects generated & some of the CGI is really poor. I don't understand why they didn't use real actor's made up as zombies I really don't, it would have looked much better & scarier. Most of the horror film clichés are present & correct, you know like people &/or animals jumping out of shadows from the edge of the screen & that sort of thing. The gore & violence is minimal so don't worry about that.Technically the film is very well made expect for some really poor CGI computer effects. Shot on location in New York the filmmakers apparently shut down whole streets & sections at a time which probably p*ssed all the native New Yorkers off big time. The acting is good but since there's only really two people in it this is one aspect that should be.I Am Legend is a good solid sci-fi, horror, thriller, action type big budget Hollywood blockbuster film that was better than I expected, I don't know whether to give it a 6 or a 7 out of 10. I think I'll go for a 6 since I'm not keen on the ending at all & spoils much of what happened previously.",6,1,4,1 January 2008
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Average comic book superhero film.
","4: Rise of the Silver Surfer starts as scientists Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) & Susand Storm (Jessica Alba) prepare to marry, however Reed is contacted by General Hager (Andre Braugher) of the US military for help in tracking a strange meteorite that has caused several large scale environmental phenomena. Reed builds a sensor to track the strange meteor which in fact turns out to be a silver humanoid alien riding a powerful surfboard, this 'silver surfer' has been sent by a huge alien space cloud named Galactus that devours entire worlds & leaves them lifeless before moving on the the next & Earth is it's next target. The Fantastic Four seem powerless to stop Galactus but the alien silver surfer may hold the key to defeating Galactus & saving Earth but trying to convince him to help isn't going to be easy...This American, German, English & Canadian co-production was directed by Tim Story & while not the worst Marvel comic books superhero film out there it's not the best either & is a distinctly average entry that I found watchable enough I suppose but nothing amazing. While I have seen the original Fantastic Four (2005) I can't really remember it which says it all & in a week or two I doubt I will remember much, if anything, about 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Here the Fantastic Four return while the Silver Surfer turns up for the first time & Victor Von Doom also makes a reappearance from the original in a rather small & pointless role, the focus of the film is definitely the Silver Surfer & the evil Galactus who wants to eat the Earth. The Silver Surfer who is used by Galactus is touched by our humanity & decides to save Earth after the Fantastic Four at first try to stop him which leads to your CGI effects heavy set-pieces which are alright but not that exciting to be honest. The comics gave the Silver Surfer & Galactus much more background & while here there's not much mention of why the Silver Surfer helps Galactus it was probably deliberate, the problem with that it is it doesn't really satisfy anyone does it? The comic book fans are disappointed since the Silver Surfer is presented as rather shallow & non comic book fans will be just confused & unsure of whats going on. At a little over 90 minutes at least it's short & it moves along at a fast pace but Reed & Susan feel like an old married couple already, the Thing comes off like a comedy relief brick-house & the Human Torch is just annoying with his attitude while Dr. Doom is wasted in a nothing role. There are a few broadly painted sentiments here like just accepting who you are, believing in humanity, self sacrifice, making the right choice & trusting each other but they aren't exactly life changing & the sub-plot about the Fantastic Four swapping powers feels like a gimmick rather than anything else.One of the reasons I am not a huge fan of the whole superhero film is that comic book character's were designed to look good as a 2-D drawing on a blank piece of paper rather than in a live action film & again here some of the set-pieces & powers displayed are just silly. The part when Reed dances with two girls using his long twisting arms is daft & some of the CGI effects aren't that good either. The action scenes are alright, there are crashing helicopters, exploding planets, flying rockets, an alien silver surfer, explosions & in a scene set in London the London Eye comes crashing down. Keep watching as the end credits roll since there's an extra minute or so that hints that the Silver Surfer is not dead & why would he be when there's money to be made by film studios?With a supposed budget of about $130,000,000 this had a lot spent on it & it looks good, sure of the CGI looks like CGI but overall this has a slick Hollywood look about it. Filmed in various locations such as Shanghai, Canada, New York, England, Russia, Japan, Egypt & Germany. The acting is alright but no-one seems that interested, Alba is poor as a scientist while the Silver Surfer is voiced by Laurence Fishburne.4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a watchable family orientated Marvel comic book superhero film that doesn't have the dark edge that many do & isn't anything that memorable even though there's plenty of CGI action scenes in it.

Men in Black II," 'Your attracted, she's not even my species & I'm attracted.' Fun if somewhat familiar sequel.
","Men in Black II starts one dark New York City night, an intergalactic spacecraft crashes in Central Park, an alien life-form named Serleena emerges & takes the form of a underwear model (Lara Flynn Boyle), Serleena is looking for the powerful Light of Zarthar & heads straight for two-headed alien Charlie (Johnny Knoxville) who tipped her off about the Light being on Earth. Eventually the trail leads to an alien named Ben (Jack Kehler) who runs a pizza place who Serleena kills as witnessed by shop assistant Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson) who then comes into contact with the Men in Black as Agent Kay (Will Smith) & Agent Tee (Patrick Warburton) are sent to investigate. When it becomes clear that Serleena is after the Light of Zarthar the MIB boss Zed (Rip Torn) says only one person knows about the Light, Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) who has been neutralised. Agent Jay must convince Agent Kay to come out of retirement, help regain his memory, stop Serleena & save the planet Earth!Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld who also has a small cameo role, I thought Men in Black II was pretty good if undemanding fun & personally that's all I really think it sets out to achieve. The script by Robert Gordon & Barry Fanaro based on the comic book by Lowell Cunningham moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring with some huge special effects sequence not too far away. From flying cars & spacecraft chasing each other over Times Square & a spacecraft travelling through space destroying every planet as it goes to huge alien worms half eating a New York subway train & a variety of bizarre aliens. The humour is still here but somehow doesn't seem as funny this time around as Men in Black II as a whole is very similar to the original Men in Black (1997), I often smiled but I never flat out laughed. The character's are still very likable but basically the same as the original with Laura becoming Agent Jay's love interest & the sexy Serleena the obligatory villain dressed in black leather, hey it works for me! One thing that Men in Black II lacks is a decent interesting story for it's character's, everything that happens in the film seems to be there purely to show off an effect, in fact Men in Black II could be described as one overblown & silly special effect after another with very little regard to what takes place between. While on the subject of the special effects I must admit that I wasn't that impressed with some of them, Will Smith riding Jeff the huge alien worm at the start look fake as does Creepy (Michael Baily Smith) the O-Zone stealing large headed flying saucer riding trio of duplicate aliens, the two headed alien played by Johnny Knoxville is both highly irritating, has probably the poorest effects & strangely just disappears two thirds through the film never to be seen again! Considering Men in Black II wasn't made that long ago I'd say the special effects are actually quite poor. With a massive estimated budget of $140,000,000 & at less than 90 minutes long it's difficult to see where all that money went, unless it was on Smith's salary. It definitely has that big budget Hollywood look & polish about it although nothing really impressed or stood out that much. The acting is OK & both Smith & Jones work well together as mismatched MIB partners. Dawson as Laura is hardly in it while the same can be said for both Knoxville & Flynn Boyle as the villains which is a shame as Boyle makes for a good baddie, in leather. I have given Men in Black II seven stars out of ten as I was entertained, had fun watching it & as a mindless way to pass 90 odd minutes it's great but as a proper emotive, thought provoking film with a moral or a message then it falls well short of the mark. I think it's well worth a watch as long as your expectations aren't too high & are just able to have fun with it.",7,3,7,12 September 2005
Event Horizon," Decent enough Sci-Fi Chiller that's a fairly entertaining watch.
","Some explanatory on screen text informs the viewer that the Event Horizon was a one-of-a-kind spacecraft designed for faster than light travel that disappeared in the year 2040 somewhere near the planet Neptune. We are then told that it's '2047...now'. Seven years after it disappeared without trace a source of transmission from the Event Horizon has been detected & traced to the orbit of Neptune. The Event Horizon's creator Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) is sent to investigate in a search & rescue ship called the Lewis and Clarke along with it's crew. The Lewis and Clarke is Captained by Joe Miller (Laurence Fishburne), his crew consists of second in command Lieutenant Starck (Joely Richardson), two engineers Smith (Sean Pertwee) & Justin (Jack Noseworthy), two medics D.J. (Jason Isaacs) & Peters (Kathleen Quinlan) plus a rescue technician named Cooper (Richard T. Jones). 56 days after leaving Earth they reach Neptune & locate the Event Horizon. They dock & Captain Miller, Peters & Justin enter the seemingly deserted spaceship. Captain Miller finds a dead mutilated body floating around & lots of blood stains on the bridge. Meanwhile Justin explores the engineering section of the Event Horizon where the core is situated, a piece of machinery which causes a sort of black hole to appear by which the Event Horizon is able to travel from any point to any other point almost instantly. Justin is sucked into the core & thrown back out again shortly after. In the ensuing panic & commotion the Lewis and Clarke is damaged, Captain Miller orders everyone on-board the Event Horizon to discuss the situation. It appears that the Event Horizon only has enough air left for 20 hours, Justin is alive but in a very bad condition & eventually tries to commit suicide by throwing himself out of an airlock. Captain Miller orders everyone to pull together, repair the Lewis and Clarke in time & make it back home safely. As the hours pass the team on-board the Event Horizon start to see visions, disturbing visions that are personally related to them. Searching through the Event Horizon's Captain John Kilpack's (Peter Marinker) video log they discover some terrifying & chilling footage that makes everyone in a big hurry to leave. Except, that is, Dr. Weir who appears to start & become possessed by his creation & isn't so keen on leaving her behind...Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson I thought Event Horizon was a decent enough Sci-Fi horror that wasn't brilliant but wasn't bad either. The biggest problem with Event Horizon is the script by Philip Eisner which is a bit of a mess. Nothing is explained satisfactorily in my opinion, it's all very vague & underdeveloped. After I finished watching Event Horizon I had more questions than answers like where did the Event Horizon go for seven years exactly? What has it brought back? What is this evils motivation for doing what it does? When these strange things start to happen & they start to realise that the Event Horizon is responsible why don't they just all stay in the Lewis and Clarke until the repairs are complete? I just didn't get Dr. Weir's motivations, he barely does anything or has any meaningful involvement apart from talking about technical mumbo-jumbo for most of the film & then just suddenly loses his marbles or becomes possessed & until this point we know very little about him so for him to suddenly turn into the bad guy felt empty almost. I didn't like the threat the team encounters, it was very unfocused & not scary or real like say the Alien from Alien (1979). There are other points throughout that I wasn't too happy about either but I won't bother going into them here. And why did the script have to include a typical annoying comedy relief character who swears & comes out with various childish one-liners which are at odds with the rest of the dialogue & characters in the film. Event Horizon also reminds me strongly of Aliens (1986) in it's set up, plot devices & all round feel. Unfortunately Event Horizon doesn't have the tension or excitement. One thing that Event Horizon's script does have going for it is the fact that it moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring, something is always happening. The production design credited to Joseph Bennett is generally very good throughout Event Horizon with it's Gothic looking spaceship sets, I especially loved the design for the core itself & the room it's housed in. Acting is OK from all involved except that annoying idiot who plays Cooper, the comedy relief. The special effects are good, but there are one or two that don't hold up so well these days. There isn't much gore or violence in it, someone with their eyes poked out, someone sliced open and hanging on hooks & someone being exposed to an open airlock where their veins start to bulge & pop. There's a bit of female nudity as well. Event Horizon is well made & has a definite slickness about it, just a shame about that script really. Overall I liked it for sure, but I didn't love it as there were to many vague points that didn't work for me. I just didn't like the evil force, give me a guy in a rubber monster suit anytime over this wishy-washy pseudo hell nonsense. Definitely worth watching but there are better out there, having said that there are a lot worse as well & you couldn't really go wrong if you can find it going cheap or are able to catch it on T.V.",5,9,17,23 April 2005
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Terrific animated fantasy film.
","The Nightmare Before Christmas starts on Halloween night in Halloween town where Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon & Danny Elfman) & the various other inhabitants of Halloween town are celebrating another highly successful night, however the celebration is tinged with sadness for Jack as he has become bored with Halloween. While out walking in the woods Jack comes across a doorway which leads to Christmas town where the inhabitants are busy preparing for Christmas day in less than two months time. Jack is enthralled & captivated by what he sees & is determined to add his own ghoulish touch to the festive celebrations, Jack manages to convince his fellow Halloween town inhabitants to help him in his audacious plan including the kidnapping of Santa Claus & the making of lots of twisted Christmas presents that he intends to deliver himself on Christmas Eve...Directed by Henry Selick The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those magical children films that should be enjoyed by kids of all ages, well possibly... The script by Caroline Thompson was based on a story by fantasy filmmaker Tim Burton & at only 75 odd minutes in length the youngster's won't get bored. The Nightmare Before Christmas is hard to categorise, it's certainly a children's film but it has a twisted dark edge to it although not a sinister or nasty one, is it a film for Christmas or a film for Halloween? I'd say it's smack bang somewhere between the two, I'd also say it's a throughly entertaining, charming & delightful film that really should appeal to the kid in all of us. Most of the film revolve around it's cool songs which show plenty of imagination, are pretty catchy & they actually help drive the story forward. I did feel it was a little compromised at times as it tried to walk the line between family entertainment & it's dark twisted side & it's not that mainstream so unfortunately maybe not quite everyone will appreciate it. The character's are both imaginative & decent enough & there are some fab musical numbers in it.Director Selnick does a good job but maybe it's the actual animator's which deserve more of the credit. The first thing to say is that The Nightmare Before Christmas is an almost completely stop-motion animated film where model puppets are shot one frame at a time together with some CGI & each character is brilliantly brought to life, from the main star Jack to even the lesser character's like the Vampires everyone is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail, tremendous care & great personality. The sets are also fantastic, from the spooky Halloween town to the bright Christmas town The Nightmare Before Christmas looks beautiful throughout & is a technical marvel. Brilliant stuff all the way & there are some truly fantastic scenes & set-pieces in here.With a supposed budget of about $18,000,000 I must admit that sounded a lot of money to me although I don't really have much of an idea of how much something like this would have cost, technically it's faultless & it's as simple & straight forward as that. It was nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects but lost out to Jurassic Park (1993) which is fair enough I suppose... The songs are well delivered & are very well written. The voice acting is good & each character really does have their own personality, you'll love each & every one of them.The Nightmare Before Christmas is a top quality film & as far as I'm concerned there's no doubt about that but I'm not sure it has great replay potential & it's with a slightly heavy heart that I also think it's not a film for everyone, definitely recommended all the same though. Re-released in 2006 in a computerised 3D version into digital 3D theatres, whatever they are...",7,1,3,23 December 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," This could have been brilliant...
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse starts as the Umbrella corporation opens up the secret bio-weapons research facility the Hive to try & discover what happened, all they succeed in doing is releasing the T-Virus & a horde of flesh eating zombies into Raccoon city... A few hours later & Raccoon city is overrun with zombies & genetically created mutations trapped there by a huge wall around the perimeter of the city, cops Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), her partner Peyton Wells (Razaaq Adoti) & a TV reporter Teri Morales (Sandrine Holt) are trapped in Raccoon city when Umbrella decide to close off the only exit out of the city & have to fight for survival with limited ammo. They team up with genetically enhanced babe Alice (Milla Jovovich) & strike a deal with Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) on the outside who says if they find his young daughter Angie (Sophie Vavasseur) who is trapped somewhere in Raccoon city he will tell them a way out...This German, French, English & Canadian production was the directorial debut of Alexander Witt & is a decent action horror film but it could have been so much better. Based on the computer game series of the same name the script by producer Paul W.S. Anderson moves along like an absolute rocket, this film is literally none stop which is just how I like them but it lacks depth as the character's are very shallow & have nothing to them apart from their names & jobs, I also don't understand how Umbrella could erect a large wall around an entire city within hours as it seems impossible, the script wisely decides not to tackle this issue though. The basic plot is pretty good & I love the basic notion of a small group of human survivors having to fight off hordes of flesh eating zombies using their wits & whatever else they can find as it reminds heavily of George A. Romero's Dead trilogy & the fact that it's based on a popular computer game where the whole idea is to kill zombies & survive means there's a lot of potential here for a cracking horror action film. Unfortunately while I love it's pace, energy & style I hated the fact that it was so tame in the gore & violence department. I would say Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the least gory zombie film I've ever seen, the potential for an out-and-out blood fest is here, there could have been countless shots of zombies having their heads blown off as well as human victims being torn to pieces & eaten but strangely it's as if the makers wanted as little blood & gore as possible. Then there's the fact that about halfway through the zombies are almost completely forgotten about & don't really feature again, very disappointing. I hated the ending as well, it doesn't make any sense & it seems to set up an entire story which obviously comes to nothing because it finishes!Director Witt does a good job, he keeps things moving along that's for sure & there are some cool action set-pieces here like motorbikes blowing up, Jovovich running down a building, fights with huge mutated monsters, explosions, shoot-outs & even a zombie dog attack but the lack of blood or any decent violence is just so distracting & disappointing. If this actually had balls & had lots of memorable gore scenes as well as the action & explosions Resident Evil: Apocalypse could have been brilliant as it is it's an average horror action film that's fairly forgettable. Looking at the rating for this film it's 'R' which really surprises me as there are a few bloodless bullet wounds, some martial arts fights, a few bloodless bites & a couple of severed hands & that's it. Why oh why didn't they just pile on the blood & gore? There's a nice feel to the film with suitably dark locations, there are some effective moments here & there as well like the school full of zombie children. I also have to mention Jill Valentine's kick ass outfit, even though it looks similar to Lara Croft's in Tomb Raider it's utterly cool & as a general rule I think more cops should wear outfits like it.With a supposed budget of about $43,000,000 this is well made with good production values, shot mostly in Ontario in Canada which was where the Dawn of the Dead (2004) remake was shot so if you notice they look very similar you know why. Oh, & for what it's worth Romero's Land of the Dead (2005) was also shot in Ontario in Canada, what is it with Ontario & zombies? The special effects are good & the big Nemesis creature looks pretty mean & nasty. The acting is alright considering the material at least the cast are easy on the eye.Resident Evil: Apocalypse could have brilliant if it had gone flat out & been a gore-fest, as it is it's a mild horror action film that doesn't really stick in the memory that much apart from Jill Valentine's outfit. I will never understand the decision to make this film so kiddie friendly, it just doesn't make sense to me. Good but not great. A sequel to Resident Evil (2002) & followed by Resident Evil: Extinction (2007).",6,1,2,2 August 2007
The Evil Dead," Fabulous, visually impressive low budget horror film.
","Five friends, Ashly 'Ash' Williams (Bruce Campbell) his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), Scott (Hal Delrich), Shelly (Theresa Tilly as Sarah York) and Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) have rented a cabin in some woods in the middle of nowhere. They drive up to the cabin, through the woods. That night, as they eat dinner, the cellar door slams open. At first everyone assumes it to be an animal, but to make sure Scott goes down into the dark cellar to check. When he doesn't come back and doesn't answer when the four remaining friends call him, Ash also enters the cellar. Along with Scott he looks around and finds a shotgun, a tape player, a dagger with a carved handle of skulls and the Necronomicon, the book of the dead, a grotesque looking book that's bound in human skin and written in blood. Back up top they play the tape, it's a spoken translation of the text contained within the book of the dead. Once played the evil dead are resurrected and awoke from their ancient slumber. Later on that night Cheryl thinks she hears someone outside her window, having gone out to investigate she is attacked and raped by possessed tree branches. She manages to make it back to the cabin, no one believes her but Ash offers to take her back to town. However it soon becomes apparent that they can't leave as the only bridge has been destroyed. Back at the cabin Cheryl becomes totally possessed by the evil dead and she stabs Linda in the ankle with a pencil. Soon more of the friends are possessed until only one remains, will anyone survive? Can the friends be saved? Can a way back to town be found? Will that chainsaw in the work shed be used for bodily mutilation, or is it just for show? Watch it and find out, now!Written and directed over the course of four years by Sam Raimi, who's now hot property in Hollywood following the success of Spider-Man (2002) and it's sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004), Raimi makes a cameo appearance in this as one of the hitchhiking fisherman near the start of the film. I love this film, it's so energetic, features loads of over-the-top gore and is just great to watch on a pure fun entertainment level, and it's no surprise Raimi has gone on to enjoy the success he has. The direction from first timer Raimi is full of imagination, style, vigour and as many clever camera tricks he can get away with and his budget would allow for. I love the 'dead cam', we get a P.O.V. shot from the evil dead as they twist and turn their way through the woods, with trees falling down in front of them as they pass over them. A cool looking shot where Ash buries Linda in the woods, the camera is placed in Linda's grave looking up at Ash as he shovels dirt into it, Ash chucks the dirt onto the camera lens, bit by bit the screen goes black until finally only Ash's face is visible through a little section that hasn't been covered, god knows how this was achieved but it works really well and looks like a lot of effort and thought went into a short scene. A great throwaway shot where the camera is positioned under Ash looking up at him as the soles of his shoes are visible on each side of the screen. Or a shot which follows Ash across the room from above his head, the camera speeds along to keep up with him and the beams in the roof coming into shot as he walks under them, and they make a whooshing noise as they quickly enter and leave the shot. And a shot where Ash walks on screen, but the image is upside down and the camera moves towards the back of his head and over it and turning 90 degrees it comes to rest on a shot of his face the right way up. Or the way Raimi can make someone walking up a wooden staircase to the cellar interesting, he puts his camera behind and underneath the slats of wood that make up the staircase and follows Ash as he walks up them from this cool angle, the film is visually excellent and a joy to watch, throughout. The acting is just OK, except Campbell who is as likable as always. The script by Raimi is also great entertainment and manages to pack the screen with a feast of blood soaked set-pieces. Although variable in quality the effects include, zombies, dismemberment, stabbings, decapitations, eye gouging, staking, shotgun blast wounds, burnings, beatings, bitten off hands and a pencil stuck in someones ankle, the blood flows freely in this one! There is also some slightly unconvincing stop motion animation at the end, but like all the special effects in this film, I've seen a lot worse and they really aren't all that bad, just not comparable to todays multi million costing soulless CGI. There a couple of shots here and there when it's obvious that a double was used probably because the original actor or actress was no longer available, in particular the fight Ash has with the possessed Linda after she emerges from the grave he buried her in, her hair style is totally different between certain shots! The only nudity is when Cheryl is raped by the possessed trees, another cool sequence. I love this film, get past a slightly slow first 20 minutes and your in for a highly entertaining and action packed gore fest, watch it as soon as you can! Highly recommended.",8,5,11,3 December 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 'Leave the limbs you've lost... they belong to me now.' Cool super violent action flick.
","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 starts as the pregnant Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) is shot & left for dead in a wedding chapel, however she is not dead & after spending four years in a coma she awakens. She was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad code named Black Mamba, she had decided to leave & her boss Bill (David Carradine) wasn't happy about it so he sent in the other members, Vernita Green AKA Copperhead (Vicica A. Fox), Budd AKA Sidewinder (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver AKA California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah) to kill her. Now she is hell bent on getting revenge for herself & her dead daughter, her first target is O-Ren Ishii AKA Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu) who since become lord of the Tokyo underground...Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a tremendous film for martial arts & action junkies & is much better then Kill Bill: Vol 2 (2004) in my opinion. The homage heavy ultra violent script moves along like a rocket here unlike it's sequel & contains in abundance everything that lacked. It's excessively violent, it's packed with some fantastic martial arts set-pieces, it has a good story about cold blooded revenge & is just utterly cool in virtually every regard. The character's are good with some over-the-top bad guys, the dialogue is alright & Tarantino has thankfully cut back on the profanity a bit. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 doesn't have any great meaning, it has no message, isn't realistic in the slightest & isn't interested in 'saying' anything as it's main aim is to excite, entertain, show Thurman running around killing lots of people in spectacular ways & pay homage to a variety of genre films. In fact there are more homages & nods to other films in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 than maybe any other film I've seen, you'll never get them all though. How can you not like a film where the entire last twenty minutes is nothing more than a blood filled massacre? That's right, you can't. A top film that is proud to be what it is, mindless violence filled martial arts fun & nothing else.Director Tarantino turns on the style here big time & again it's so much better than Kill Bill: Vol. 2 in that respect. There's a little animated segment which is in the style of Japanese Anime which looks great, Uma Thurman in her yellow tracksuit with samurai sword will surely become an iconic image, there's loads of poetic wonderfully choreographed sword fights & violence with huge amounts of blood spurting & spraying everywhere in Shogun Assassin (1980) style! There's decapitations, peoples legs are sliced off, wood with nails stuck in it is used to kill, arms are graphically sliced off with with the victims rolling around in agony, people are impaled on swords, sliced up by swords, someone has their eyeball plucked out, axes are thrown & hit people in the chest & forehead, someone is cut in half vertically (Shogun Assassin again), someone has the top of their head sliced off, a mans head is bashed with a door, someones lip is ripped off, there are over-the-top amounts of spurting blood that resemble fountains, lots of sword & knife fights & the body count has to be somewhere approaching the 100 mark. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 delivers the goods but I don't like it when it switches to black and white, I just found it annoying & unnecessary & why didn't they release the full colour version throughout the rest of the world since it was just the American censors that had a problem?With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 Kill Bill: Vol. 1 looks great with slick cinematography, great effects, fantastic set-pieces & high production values. The music is very good as well & Tarantino uses it to great effect. The acting is OK but then this isn't really about acting, David Carradine is never seen during this film which I thought was odd.Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a classic & there's no doubt about it, I love it for it's excessive violence & bloodshed along with it's style & cool revenge plot. It's not very deep or meaningful but who cares? If you don't like violence then stay well away but for anyone else this is a must.",8,1,5,4 July 2007
Saw II," Better than the original in my opinion.
","Saw II starts as detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is called out to a grisly homicide scene by his ex-partner Kerry (Dina Meyer) who is now working full time on finding the notorious serial killer Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), at the crime scene detective Matthews sees that Jigsaw has left him a message. After managing to track Jigsaw down to a warehouse the cops think that his reign of terror is over but Jigsaw still has one last sadistic game to play as he has placed eight total strangers in a secured house that is slowly filling with poisonous gas which will kill them all within two hours, that is unless they can work together to solve Jigsaw's often fatal & always very painful puzzles & clues which will lead to both their freedom & the antidote for the poison. Things turn personal for the cops & detective Matthews in particular when Jigsaw reveals his teenage son Daniel (Erik Knudsen) is one of the eight...The first sequel to the surprise horror thriller hit Saw (2004) which was apparently rushed into production to capitalise on the original films huge success Saw II was co-written & directed by Darren Lynn Bousman based on a script he had written which was originally called 'The Deperate' which went unmade for years until enterprising producers though of turning it into the next Saw film with the writer of the original Saw Leigh Whannell brought on board to turn it into a 'proper' Saw film. Like most good sequels Saw II takes what made the original work & expand on it making it more of a spectacle & more elaborate on a grander scale, to be honest I actually didn't like the original Saw as much as some did & I have to say in my opinion I think Saw II is a significant improvement on it. The first Saw had just two people trapped in a solitary room while true to expectation Saw II sees eight people trapped in an entire house littered with deadly booby traps, the first Saw kept Jigsaw hidden & mysterious but since that won't work here he is given a major role in the film & his background & motivations are fleshed out a bit & while the original Saw had a fairly amusing if flawed novelty twist ending I have to say I think the twist ending to Saw II is fabulous, very clever, very well thought out which dovetails the ending of Saw rather nicely & I certainly didn't see it coming at all & I doubt anyone else will either. With a larger cast of character's this is one aspect of the film which is fairly poor with some really poorly fleshed out character's that are there either for exposition purposes or simply to be killed off to bump the body count up.One aspect of Saw II that I am not a big fan of is how it's shot in a very raw documentary style with a very shaky hand-held camera feel & some annoyingly quick editing although having said that it's not as bad as some films & at least I could always make out what was happening. The main attraction of a film like Saw II for most viewers are undoubtedly the gore set-pieces & torture scenes. The opening Venus fly-trap kill where a spike embossed two piece helmet snaps shut around some poor guy's head is a great way to kick the film off, besides that we get someone tossed into a pit full of needles, a gory slashed throat, some cut off skin, a baseball bat with nails hammered through the end is stuck in some guy's head, someone is shot through the eye & the back of their head is blown off & someone is burnt alive in a furnace. Apparently the whole film was shot in one building in a mere 25 days.According to the IMDb Saw II had a budget of about $4,000,000 which is no money at all for a major film & it opened 30th October 2005 with over $31,500,000 which was almost the same amount Saw V (2008) opened to this weekend just gone. Filmed in Toronto in Canada to keep the budget down even more. The cast do a decent enough job but some of the lesser character's feel a little faceless as the actor's are given little material to work with.Saw II is a fine sequel to a surprising smash hit horror film that I actually think is better than the original in just about every way, I liked it a lot & put together a terrific twist ending & some cool gore & torture sequences what's not to like? Followed by the equally as good Saw III (2006) & Saw IV (2007).",7,2,5,27 October 2008
From Dusk Till Dawn," Very entertaining action packed horror film.
","From Dusk Till Dawn starts with two wanted criminals on the run, brothers Seth (George Clooney) & Richard Gecko (Quentin Taratino) are wanted for murder & robbery. They hatch a plan to cross the border into Mexico & kidnap a preacher named Jacob (Hervey Keitel) & his two kids Kate (Juliette Lewis) & Scott (Ernest Liu) to help them, hiding in the back of Jacob's large motor-home they manage to get across the border to the relative safety of Mexico. Seth has arranged a meeting with Mexican crime-boss to pay him off to let them stay at criminal hideaway El Rey, the meeting is set to take place at the Titty Twister bar which is actually frequented by blood sucking Vampires...Edited, co-produced & directed by Robert Rodriguez this action come Vampire flick is a bit of a gem that I have seen several times since it first came out & enjoy it each & every time. The script was by star Quentine Taratino who had just had bags of commercial & critical success (hell, he even won an Oscar for the screenplay) with Pulp Fiction (1994) & he followed that up with From Dusk Till Dawn which is a terrific Vampire horror film with a touch of heist flick about it. As has already been mentioned by the whole world & it's brother From Dusk Till Dawn can be split straight down the middle, the first half being a crime film with the Gecko brothers on the run from the law & during this half there is absolutely no indication that the second half of the film will explode into a full blown exploitation Vampire horror flick. Personally I think the sudden shift in tone, structure & even genre is a masterstroke & keeps the film unpredictable & it just feels totally & utterly right. There's plenty of action & gore, there's plenty of one-liners & amusing dialogue & it moves along like a rocket so it's never boring. Most of the character's are very good although I don't like how Tarantino made the Gecko brothers so unlikable, as the stars I would have thought they should be likable & not setting fire to innocent connivance store clerks which is the first meaningful thing we see them do.Director Rodriguez does a good job here with plenty of action & gore. It's clear both Rodriguez & Tarantino are exploitation fans & From Dusk Till Dawn is stuffed full of homages & nods to a style of film-making long gone. In fact the name of the film itself is taken from the signs found on drive-ins which showed this type of film. These signs indicate the length of the shows, which ran 'from dusk till dawn'. There's a fair amount of violence & gore although nothing too graphic since it needed to get an 'R' rating, there's slit throats, decapitated heads, ripped out hearts, blood spurting, lots of severed limbs, exploding & melting Vampires, chucks bitten out of flesh, holes in hands & other assorted bodily mutilations. The film has a nice style & looks very nice as well. The special effects are generally good although the CGI computer effects look a bit dated now, having said that most of the effects are of the on set rubber & fake blood variety.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 this is very well made with high production values. As well as being stuffed with exploitation homages in the script there are several cast members who will be recognizable to any horror film fan including Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, Harvey Keitel, John Saxon in a disappointingly little cameo, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo & Salma Hayek also gets a small role. The acting is pretty good & the best thing thing Clooney has ever done.From Dusk Till Dawn is a really fun action horror film that has a large plot twist about halfway through which I thought worked great. Followed by two straight-to-video sequels From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money (1999) & From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter (2000) which were both poor & killed a potential franchise before it even started.",8,1,3,25 March 2008
Men in Black," Fun sci-fi action film.
","Men in Black starts as NYPD cop James Edwards (Will Smith) has an encounter with an alien disguised as a human, he is contacted by the mysterious Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) who tells him about a secret organisation that monitor & control alien activity on Earth & if he wants a job he's in. Meanwhile a huge cockroach like alien has landed nearby & is in search of an Arquillian disguised as an antiques dealer (Mike Nussbaum) who has something he needs, a Galaxy in a marble. Edwards accepts the job & he becomes Agent J, he soon finds himself in the thick of the action as an Arquillian battle cruiser threatens to blow up Earth unless the Galaxy is returned to them...Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld who replaced Les Mayfield shortly before production began this is a pretty fun sci-fi with some neat special effects but when all said & done doesn't add up to much. Producer Steven Spielberg hired David Koepp to do a rewrite on the script by Ed Solomon which in all fairness ended up pretty good, it doesn't take itself too seriously & was based on character's from a comic book that only ran for 6 issues in 1990 & it's no co-incidence that the film feels like a comic book itself, it's very over-the-top, it's quite funny at times & it's even occasionally witty as well. There's a touch of satire here as the whole alien cover up issue is played for laughs as it's a commonly accepted theory. The cheeky & jokey Will Smith plays nicely of the deadpan Tommy Lee Jones, there are some funny one-liners, some neat aliens & it moves along at a nice pace. There are some good set-pieces as well although overall the story is average fair & while it's undoubtedly fun to watch there's not much substance beyond flashy CGI computer effects & once the whole Men in Black idea has worn off by the 30 minute mark it doesn't really have anywhere else to go & becomes a bit repetitive.Director Sonnenfeld does a fine job, the special effects scenes are impressive & the film has visual flair & style. The alien creatures are very imaginative like the little guy in a mans face controlling him or the baby squid like alien or the worm guy's & all the other's that are dotted throughout the film. The special effects & CGI computer effects are superb as one would expect from a film with this sort of mega budget. That totally out of the blue ending that comes from nowhere is a bit odd though, don't you think? The violence is tame although there are maybe a few scary scenes that might not be suitable for younger children & there is a fair amount of bad language. Apparently Quentin Tarantino was offered the chance to direct Men in Black but turned it down, wow just imagine how the film might of turned out if he had accepted!With a budget of about $90,000,000 Men in Black is well made with excellent production values as one would expect, it has that big budget Hollywood look & feel. Danny Elfman provides his usual recycled score that sounds the same as his other's. The acting is OK, the two leads play off each other well & are an amusing contrast at times, rumour has it after reading the script Will Smith didn't want to do the film but his wife convinced him otherwise. Apparently Clint Eastwood was offered the role of K but turned it down while Chris O'Donnell & David Schwimmer were both offered the part of J but foolishly, considering their's & Will Smith's subsequent careers, said no.Men in Black is a good light hearted sci-fi film that can be witty, funny, clever & exciting but maybe not quite on a consistent level. It's still a very good film though & definitely one worth checking out if you haven't already. Followed by a sequel Men in Black II (2002) a cartoon series Men in Black: The Series (1997 - 2001).",7,4,6,31 July 2007
Taken," Decent action thriller.
","Taken starts in Los Angeles where former hardened spy Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) attends his daughter Kim's (Maggie Grace) seventeenth birthday party, separated from Kim's mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) he tries to stay close to Kim & involved in her life. Kim ask's her father to sign documents that will allow her to travel alone with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) to Paris & throughout Europe, at first Bryan is hesitant to sign the papers but finally agrees. Once in Paris the two girls are kidnapped by Albanian gangsters who specialise in prostitution & the slave trade, Bryan manages to fly to Paris & uses his contacts to obtain the information he needs & sets about finding his daughter Kim & saving from a life of drugged up prostitution & dishing out a little revenge on the way...This American, English & French co-production was directed Pierre Morel & is a very gritty action thriller that is almost great but not quite, while it has some good action scenes & a solid plot I thought it lacked a little something & I ended up wanting a bit more. The script takes itself very seriously & the overall film has a gritty feel, there's no one-liners or messing around here when Bryan goes in he goes in hard & fast with no messing. The central concept is ever so slightly racist as the idea that Europe is dangerous & your liable to get kidnapped & sold into prostitution is a little overplayed, the other central theme of the unity of the family & that nothing else matters is rather broad. The bad guy's keep changing, from a guy at an airport to Alabanian pimps to mega rich oil sheiks, Bryan brings them all down in the end though. At about 90 minutes in length Taken moves along at a decent pace & there's enough shoot-outs, fights & action to keep one entertained but I didn't find any of it particularly memorable. The character's are alright but I found the coldness of Bryan played by Liam Neeson distracting & I didn't like it at all, even the other character's are a little thin.Available in an Uncut Internationa version & an edited US theatrical edition there's a couple of minutes of difference between the two but nothing that noticeable. The action scenes are good, they are swift & fairly brutal without any prolonged fights or shoot-outs, if Bryan wants to kill someone he just kills them. There's a decent car chase through a building site too.With a supposed budget of about $25,000,000 this ended up being a big box-office just about everywhere it was released, filmed in Paris & Los Angeles. The acting is OK, as I said I didn't like Neeson's cold performance at all though. Australian pop singer Holly Valance turns up as a pop singer.Taken is a solid action thriller with a tough gritty edge, I can't say it's particularly original but is good for what it is. Action fans should like it & definitely worth a watch.",5,1,2,7 March 2011
The Mummy Returns," 'You know, a couple of years ago, this would have seemed really strange to me.' Highly enjoyable big budget action.
","The Mummy Returns begins in 'Egypt 1933' where the now married Rick (Brendan Fraser) & Evelyn O'Connell (Rachel Weisz) are on the trail of an ancient artifact called The Bracelet of Anubis, a bracelet that belonged to the evil Mathayus the Scorpion King (The Rock) centuries ago. Meanwhile at Hamunaptra the city of the dead the evil Baltus Hafez (Alun Armstrong) & Meela Nais (Patricia Velasquez) the reincarnation of Egyptian princess Anck Su Namun have discovered the remains of the high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who they intend to bring back to life to fight & defeat the reincarnated Scorpion King & take control of his army that will enable them to conquer the earth. However Baltus needs the Bracelt of Anubis to reveal the location of the Scorpion King's pyramid & they will go to any lengths to gain possession of the bracelet which currently Rick & Evelyn have although unknown to them their young son Alex (Freddie Boath) has it on his wrist. Baltus & his gang kidnap Alex & use him to show them the way to the Scorpion King, although Rick, Evelyn, Jonathan (John Hannah) & Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) are hot on their tails to save Alex & the world...Written & directed by Stephen Sommers The Mummy Returns was the sequel to the smash hit remake of The Mummy (1999) & in my opinion is a slightly better film. The script is all about being bigger, louder & better than the original with one extravagant overblown set-piece after another. The film moves along like a rocket, in fact The Mummy Retrurns has to be one of the fastest paced films I've ever seen, there's barely a scene that goes by where there isn't a special effect, shoot-out, chase, explosion or some sort of action. As a result the character's are pretty shallow & I honestly don't know why Jonathan is back as he does nothing, I think in some ways they're as much of a passenger as we, the viewer, are. The story introduces all sorts of mythical Egyptian cities, legends & monsters & feels very much like an Indiana Jones globe-trotting action packed adventure with a hint of archaeology & horror thrown in there! Although The Mummy Returns is about as far removed from reality as any film can be so don't expect to learn anything, if you know what I mean. The Mummy Returns is big budget over-the-top entertainment that I thought was great fun & had had many enjoyable sequences although it's a little silly & a bit overlong at over two hours.Director Sommers does a good job, there's plenty of flashy CGI effects & some great action sequences. Everything looks great, the production design is top-notch as are the costumes, locations & period sets. The fights are well choreographed & I rather liked the the Scorpion King monster at the end even if the close-up special effects aren't the best. Not that it matters but if you look at Rachel Weisz's boots she wears throughout the film you'll notice how the heel changes between shots, sometimes she has high heels, then medium & then totally flat soles depending on what she has to do, however I'll cut her some slack as I don't think you could do back-flips in high heels without breaking your ankles...With a supposed budget of about $98,000,000 The Mummy Returns is well made & has that big budget Hollywood polish to it. The acting is almost incidental, it's not particularly good from anyone but it'll do. Is it just me or does anyone else think Rachel Weisz looks really hot in this?The Mummy Returns in my opinion is a great film, it moves along like a rocket & it has some terrific action scenes & special effects. There's plenty of bang for your money here, definitely worth a watch & I reckon it's a highly entertaining film. After proving popular here The Rock got his own spin-off film The Scorpion King (2002) while on the back of The Mummy Returns the animated TV series The Mummy: The Animated Series (2001) was made.",8,0,2,28 October 2006
Drag Me to Hell," I wanted to like it & I did but I just wanted more.
","Drag Me to Hell starts as bank loan arranger Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is begged by an old gypsy woman Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) who is in arrears with her mortgage repayments to extend her loan again, with a vacant assistant manager's position up for grabs Christine does the the thing that will earn the bank money & refuses. Later that night Allison is attacked by the old woman & a curse is placed upon her in which after three days of supernatural torment a demon called Lamia will literally drag the cursed person to hell where they shall remain for all eternity. Allison suffers from horrible visions & nightmares as Lamia torments her in preparation for the third day when Allison will be dragged to hell. Can psychic Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) help to rid Allison of the ancient curse or will Lamia claim yet another victim...Co-written, produced & directed by Sam Raimi this was supposed to be his big return to the horror genre after his mega hit Spider-Man films he wrote the script after he made Army of Darkness (1992) but didn't get to make it until some sixteen years later, a return to his roots where he began with The Evil Dead trilogy & while I did like Drag Me to Hell I was somewhat disappointed with it as well. The script tries to mimic & mix the crazy anything goes horror & outrageousness of The Evil Dead with the toned down respectability of a Hollywood teen friendly PG effort that feels a little neutered. There's some crazy set-pieces that have a certain bizarreness about them, in particular the fight between the old woman & Allison where the old woman's false teeth get knocked out & her eye is stapled shut which I assume is meant to be funny but just isn't. There's some good horror moments too like a nice jump scare moment when the old lady is in bed next to Allison & vomits a load of maggots & bugs over her face & then there's scenes which try to mix comedy & horror like when Allison drops an anvil on the old ladies head & her eyeballs shoot out in a surreal moment (why is an anvil hanging up bu a length of rope in your shed?). The curse aspect of the story is quite thin & there's not much to it, we never really see Lamia in it's true form & there's very little background given to the curse itself. The character's are OK with Allison a likable lead & the film does entertain although I just think it lacks a little cohesion & there aren't enough 'moments' in it plus it's too tame.I could definitely see how Drag Me to Hell could split an audience, it may not appeal to all but I think most would enjoy it on some level. There's some light comedic stuff, some proper horror & one or two jumpy moments & a little outlandishness thrown in there too, I mean there's even a talking goat here at one point. The gore level is very disappointing here, I saw the 'Extended Edition' on Blu-ray & there's really not much to speak of besides a bloody nose bleed, a little blood splatter, some flying eyeballs & a few dead bodies. The film has a good pace but it really kicks in when the curse is laid & Lamia haunts & torments Allison for a few days before running out of steam a bit at the end. There's one very silly moment in which a possessed handkerchief attacks Allison & she fights with it, to say it looks ridiculous is not needed & handkerchief's are not scary or threatening either.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this wasn't mega budget but it wasn't exactly low budget either, it got a lukewarm reception at the box-office although I am sure it did make a small profit. Filmed in Los Angeles in California. The acting is alright with likable leads although no big stars.Drag Me to Hell is a fun enough return to the horror genre for Raimi but I was expecting a little bit more, a bit more gore & a bit more genuine black humour. I liked it but I didn't love it, having said that it's still one of the better recent Hollywood horror flicks.",6,0,7,1 December 2009
Saw," Awful, I hated it.
","I went to see 'saw' (oh dear!) the day it opened here in the UK, three days ago, last Friday in fact. The film opens with a guy in a bath of water, he wakes up and manages to save himself from drowning. He is chained to a pipe in a room somewhere and its pitch black. As it happens another guy is chained to a pipe on the opposite side of what turns out to be a large bathroom of some sort. He finds a light and turns it on. They have never met each other before, or so they tell each other and there's also a dead body in the middle of the room. They both find audio tapes in their pockets which they play. Turns out some psycho has locked them in there and one has to kill the other or they will both be locked in the room and left to die. The films also jumps to the outside world periodically to focus on the bad guy and the police trying to track him down, hes done this sort of thing before you see. I hated this film, it tries to be clever but ends up being the most stupid piece of rubbish I've seen in a long time. The 'plot' has so many holes in it its unbelievable, you need to throw all logic out of the window if you want to convince yourself this is at all feasible or possible.*WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS* How did the guy in the bath not drown? He was totally submerged in water. Yet when he woke the Doctor on the other side of the bathroom was up and walking around. How did the killer put him in the bath and set the scene up within two or three minutes before he would have drowned? And surely the Doctor would have heard what was going on and therefore his plan and that ridiculous twist ending couldn't have possibly worked in reality. Which ever way you look at it it just doesn't make any sense, and to me is totally laughable. Why do they spend so much time talking about whos doing this to them? I'd have thought at that point in time it was totally irrelevant, they were on a tight time limit, I'd have thought trying to escape would be far more important. It would be to me. When Danny Glover finds some hard evidence as to who the killer is why does he just take one cop and not tell anyone else? And why couldn't they just arrest him? Shoot him in the leg anything but to just let him run away when they were both armed? The one cop runs after him and fires his shotgun into his back. The killer falls over but there is no wound or damage to his clothes. What happened to the gunshot that was fired straight at him? Even if the killer was wearing protection surely his outer clothing would have been ripped by the shotgun blast. The killer was supposedly ill yet he managed to overpower a young man with a baseball bat quite easily it seemed. Why was Danny Glover paying the photographer to take pictures of the Doctor? How did the killer know this? When you think about it it simply doesn't make any sense. And other thing about that awful twist ending, what if the third man involved in the game didn't turn up or something happened to him, how would the killer escape? There was no way to open the door from the inside, or so it seemed. Why did the Doctor not see that there was no empty shells in the gun when he picked it up and opened the chamber? The dead man couldn't have committed suicide, he was calm enough to take aim and shoot the photographer in the shoulder only wounding him. So it wasn't like he had gone insane or mad, he was still sane and alert. And the reason they were both chosen was a let down. One because he was having an affair and the other because he took photographs of people, wow very exciting, not. I could write about the stupid plots holes in the film all day if I wanted but I'll stop now.*END OF SPOILERS*The best part of the film is the beginning when everything is a mystery, as the film develops the stupid plot twists take over and pretty much ruin the whole film. Very poor, stupid, tedious and boring. And don't be fooled by the graphic posters, there is no gore whatsoever, a few after the event dead bodies, a hand full of guts that stay on screen for about three seconds and a couple of gunshots, thats it. Very tame. I've heard this film compared to David Finchers Seven, its not even in the same league.",Null,4,13,4 October 2004
A Clockwork Orange," I didn't thin it was the masterpiece it's made to be but I still thought it was a very good film.
","A Clockwork Orange is set in England in the near future where the teenage thug Alex (Malcolm McDowell) & his gang of Drrogs roams the streets beating up, killing & raping anyone they like. After murdering a woman (Miriam Karlin) with a giant penis Alex is caught by the police, convicted of murder & sentenced to fourteen years in prison. After spending two years in prison Alex agrees to take part in revolutionary Ludovico Treatment which psychologically conditions violent & sexual urges, after a two week treatment course Alex is released completely cured. However Alex finds himself in a harsh world unable to make any moral choice, unable to fight back or protect himself Alex is beaten up & left for dead. Seeking help Alex finds himself at the house of writer Frank Alexander (Patrick Magee) whom was left crippled by Alex & his Droogs several years earlier, Frank decides to try & make Alex commit suicide & both gain revenge & bring the Government down in a blaze of bad publicity...This American & English co-production was written & directed by Stanley Kubrick based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, one of the more controversial films released by a major studio A Clockwork Orange has quite a reputation & while in terms of violence & sex it can't really hope to compare with more recent offerings this is a fine film that has meaning, intelligence & makes a statement that is still relevant even now over forty years after it was originally made. Now that's visions, right? The social political story about rampant youth crime, overcrowded prisons, victims rights, rehabilitation, probation, psychiatric cures, the breakdown of the family unit & law & order feels totally contemporary & you can see that the Kubrick's vision of a future Britian really isn't that far off from the way things are now with all the issues & themes raised in A Clockwork Orange still relevant today, if not even more so than back in 1971. From inmates using the bible to fuel their sexual & violent fantasies to the corruption & underhand use of the system, from Alex starting out as a thug & then being cured only for a public media outcry which claim Alex's human rights have been violated while ignoring his victims so he is simply to be at the end to carry on as a thug free as a bird. I found the issues & themes very timely & the film as a whole fascinating to watch but at two & a quarter hours long it goes on forever, I doubt I would want to sit through it again & Alex goes from monster to hero & back again so your never quite sure what to feel for him but I suspect this was intentional on Kubrick's part & is admittedly done in a clever & manipulative way. Although always watchable & engaging some may find A Clockwork Orange a little slow at times & the strange language which is apparently a mix of English, Russian & slang may be off-putting for some although I always new what was being spoken about & thought the abstract dialogue was rather entertaining & very amusing in places.While the issues & themes in A Clockwork Orange haven't dated at all what about the visual look of the film? Well, apart from some bad 70's colours & technology this still looks great & hasn't dated badly at all. There are some great scenes, some poetic violence set to classical music like when two rival gangs of thugs fight each other to Rossini's Thieving Magpie & Alex's liking for Ludwig Van Beethoven's ninth means it's used throughout. The Ludovico treatment scene has Alex strapped into a chair with metal hooks holding his eyes open in what must have been an incredibly painful & uncomfortable scene to film.With a supposed budget of about $2,200,000 A Clockwork Orange turned out to be one of the biggest money makers of 1971, nominated for four Oscar's & seven BAFTA's it actually won none of either. Filmed here in England almost entirely on location, Woolwich Barracks prison was used for the interior prison scenes while the exterior was actually Wandsworth prison. The acting is very good, I am sure McDowell suffered for the part both physically & mentally. Having said that everyone seems to shout a lot & everyone plays it over the top with some funny facial expressions.A Clockwork Orange is a really good film, I would maybe stop just short of calling it a classic or even a great film as it's a bit too long & the artsy mix of culture & violence & sex may put some off. The themes & issues are bang on & it's a clever film by a visionary filmmaker but as I said, I don't think I would want to see it again.",6,3,6,26 February 2011
The Fly," Brilliant horror film from David Cronenberg.
","Eccentric, brilliant and extremely likable scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) manages to convince a journalist named Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) working for 'Particle Magazine' to accompany him back to his apartment so he can show her his invention that will, according to him, change the world. Eventually Veronica agrees. Seth shows her his 'Telepods'. Devices that reintegrate objects placed in one pod and reintegrates them in another. Veronica is suitably impressed and takes the story to her ex-boyfriend and editor Stathis Borans (John Getz) who doesn't believe her and says that Seth is trying to con her. Seth contacts Veronica again and asks her to cover the remaining development of the telepods. Veronica sensing a massive story that she will have exclusive rights to, agrees. After some teething troubles Seth feels he is ready to test the pods out on himself. Unfortunately a fly is trapped in Seths pod as he is teleported. The computer which controls the teleportation decides to splice Seth's and the Fly's genes together. Veronica notices drastic changes in Seth's appearance and personality as he undergoes an horrific transformation into the Fly!Co-written and directed by David Cronenberg I thought this was quite simply an excellent horror film. The script by Cronenberg and Charles Edward Pogue is gripping and really works on an emotional level unlike so many horror films, I actually felt sorry for Seth by the end and the rest of the characters are fleshed out very well so that we care for them. The pacing is excellent, starting off at a sedate pace but never becoming boring and then building up to the gory climax. The acting from both Goldblum and Davis is superb, if they have ever turned in a better performance than I have yet to see it. There are actually very few characters in the film, Seth, Veronica and Stathis is about it. The special effects look pretty good. There isn't much blood or gore, a bone sticking out of an arm and a melted hand is about it. But there are lots of disgusting gooey effects as Goldblum changes into a Fly. It's very well made and looks good. I've nothing really bad to say about it. It was an absolute pleasure to spend and hour and a half of my time watching this. Highly recommended, especially for those who value a well written story with good characters. Don't miss it.",9,11,19,26 January 2005
From Hell," 'England doesn't have any whores, just a great mass of very unlucky women.' Overlong inaccurate account of Jack the Ripper.
","From Hell is set in the filth of a Victorian London during 1888 in the Whitechapel District where it seems there are prostitutes & knife wielding maniac's on every corner, a bit like it is now then really! It starts by introducing a group of six friends, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), Ann Crook (Joanna Page), Liz Stride (Susan Lynch), Annie Chapman (Katrin Cartlidge), Polly Nichols (Annabelle Apsion) & Kate Eddowes (Lesley Sharp) who all happen to be prostitutes & supposedly look out for each other. One member of the group, Ann Crook is now the Mother of a young baby, has recently married into money & promises the girls that she will give them four quid to pay a Victorian pimp named McQueen (David Schofield) & his men. Shortly after the girls then witness Ann, her husband Albert (Mark Dexter) & their baby being dragged screaming from a flat by Ben Kidney (Terence Harvey) & his men who all work for Scotland Yard special branch, later on that night Mary is warned not to mention to anyone what she saw. Also that night Polly is brutally murdered, she has her throat cut from ear to ear & her body is horribly mutilated. The drug addicted Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp), Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) & Scotland Yard's finest are on the case. Annie Chapman is next to be brutally slain by the killer who has become known as 'Jack the Ripper', getting absolutely nowhere with his investigations Inspector Abberline seeks the advice of Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) & his protégé Dr. Ferral (Paul Rhys). Together they agree that the 'Ripper' is probably an educated man & very knowledgeable about human anatomy & the use of surgical instruments indicating that he may be a Doctor. As Abberline gets closer to unveiling 'Jack the Rippers' identity he faces resistance from his superiors, special branch, falls in love with Mary & uncovers dark secrets & conspiracy's that go to the very highest levels of Royalty & Government...Executive produced & directed by Albert & Allen Hughes as The Hughes Brothers I thought From Hell was an OK mystery thriller but nothing to get too excited about. The script by Terry Hayes & Rafael Yglesias based on the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore & Eddie Campbell is far too long & becomes dull to watch as it neither works as a factual reconstruction of the 'Ripper' events or as a fictional horror/thriller, this feels like a teen slasher based around a few of the more well-known Ripper elements. There are massive inaccuracies between what takes place in From Hell & what happened in reality, the prostitutes never knew each other & if this is the case then the entire explanation that From Hell gives must be wrong & therefore most of From Hell is pure fiction straight away & this alone destroys any sort of credibility that it tries to achieve. Inspector Abberline was nothing like Johnny Depp & he lived until 1929 & had a distinguished career, & I'm not too sure if the real Inspector Abberline would have had psychic visions of the murders before they happened! I'm positive that there are loads more too. From Hell falls also flat as a fictional tale because it is just far to intricate, there are too many characters who do very little, not enough screen time is given to the 'Ripper' or his motives & far too much time is given to the group of moaning filthy prostitutes. I also thought the semi-happy ending & Jack's eventual motive were well off the pace. But the thing that really sinks From Hell in my humble opinion is that it is just so slow, dull & uneventful. In fact I actually fell asleep about 20 or so minutes before the end & had to rewind the tape so I could catch the end, I shouldn't have bothered really. On a positive note From Hell has exceptional production design, the filth, squaller & nastiness of the back streets of Victorian London are wonderfully recreated in great detail. From Hell is also a visually strong film with some flashy camera techniques like when the Ripper stabs a girl in a pitch black archway where at first the only thing we see is the silver blade of his knife as it catches the light but the blade starts to turn more red each time it re-catches the light after disappearing for a second, editing tricks & nice use of CGI to enhance certain imagery & some of the cityscapes of Victorian London with a shot of Big Ben in complete shadow at night & a gorgeous looking red sky behind it particularly springing to mind. The violence & gore was mostly implied & mostly consisted of graphic shots of dead bodies although there is one of the best on screen slit throats it's been my pleasure to view... Technically From Hell is top-notch throughout, but then that's the least I expect from a film with an estimated budget of $35,000,000, the acting is very good from all involved & a special mention goes to the fantastic Robbie Coltrane who is just brilliant & makes his character very likable. Overall I thought From Hell was an OK way to pass a couple of hours & I can't in all honesty call it a bad film but it could have been done with being 15 or 20 odd minute's shorter which would have increased the pace & helped maintain my interest. As it stands I don't think I'll be in any hurry to watch it again anytime soon. Worth watching if you can find a copy going cheap or catch it on TV for free.",6,4,8,27 June 2005
Reservoir Dogs," A solid crime thriller but overrated in my opinion & not one of the best 250 films ever made.
","Reservoir Dogs is set in Los Angeles as seven hardened criminals have been hired by big time mobster Joe Cabot (producer Lawrence Tierney) & his son Nice Guy Eddie Cabot (Chris Penn) to carry out an armed robbery at a diamond store, the seven men are given an alias to do with colours & told never to reveal their real names to each other. The robbery goes horribly wrong, Mr. White (co-producer Hervey Keitel) helps a badly wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) to the arranged rendezvous point, an old abandoned warehouse where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) turns up shortly after. The arguments & accusations fly over what happened & whether someone set them all up, then gun happy psycho Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) show's up with kidnapped cop officer Marvin Nash (Kirk Baltz) in the trunk of his car. Tensions rise & emotions run high, no-one know's who to trust as they each become convinced one of the other's is an undercover cop...Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino who also has a small role in the film as Mr. Brown of the lesser seen thieves this has to be a brilliant film since, at the time I write this comment, it sits proudly at number 64 in the IMDb's user voted Top 250 films of all time. Right? Well no, not in my opinion anyway & I am positive there other's out there on planet Earth who consider Reservoir Dogs a fine film in it's own right but also feel it's a somewhat overrated film. I suppose it was quite a fresh take on filmmaking in general at time, Tarantino's now famous & often copied style of lazy, laid back dialogue between character's that verges on being about nothing in particular that we as an ordinary person in the audience can relate to like the early scene set in the diner where the informal discussion ranges from Madonna to th ethics of whether to leave a tip for a waitress to attention grabbing dialogue we can't relate to but would like to. Well written, catchy & full of profanity it appears people either love Tarantino's ear for dialogue or hate it & whether you consider Reservoir Dogs the classic so many think it is will depend on your opinion of it. At 100 minutes long this is a heist film where you never actually see the heist, just little flashes of the aftermath & the consequences of it. There's one big twist as to who the undercover cop is but I didn't find it much of a surprise to be honest. There are one or moments that didn't sit well with me either, if the cops knew what was going on all along why did they wait so long at the end to raid the warehouse & let their own man bleed to death? Why did Mr. White say he was close to killing Mr. Blone in the store yet when Mr. Blonde show's up Mr. White says Mr. Pink was close to killing him? Why did Joe go to the warehouse if he thought Mr. Orange was a cop?Almost entirely dialogue driven with very little on screen action or violence I will give Tarantino credit for making a film where not much happens yet still manages to hook the audience & have an impact. The notorious ear slicing scene is very tame in reality, literally nothing of the cutting is seen & while there's some bloody gunshot wounds not much else. There are no female speaking parts in Reservoir Dogs at all which is unusual for a film. Mr. Blue is never seen beyond the opening sequence & his fate was meant to have been filmed but the budget didn't stretch that far & it was never shot in the end.With a low budget of about $1,500,000 it's said most of the actor's wore their own clothes, well shot with some nice cinematography the production values are good. Tarantino wanted James Woods to play a role, Christopher Walken turned down the part of Mr. Blonde while David Duchovny, George Clooney & Samuel L. Jackson apparently auditioned for roles. The acting is very good from a good cast anyway though.Reservoir Dogs is a very good film for sure but it's not one of the best 250 ever, in fact i can name 100 right now of the top of my head that better including the Tarantino directed Pulp Fiction (1994) & Kill Bill (2003). A good film I am sure most will enjoy but somewhat overrated in my opinion.",6,1,4,24 July 2010
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," A film with something to offend most tastes!
","'1944-45 Northern Italy, during the Nazi-Fascist occupation ANTE INFERNO' no I don't know what it means either but that's what appears on screen at the very start to Salo O Le 120 Giornate Di Sodoma after the opening credits. Four people are sitting around a table, The Duke (Paolo Bonacelli), The Bishop (Giorgio Cataldi), The Magistrate or his Excellence (Umberto Paolo Quintavalle) and the President (Aldo Valletti) and each sign a book of their made up 'laws'. They send soldiers out to capture 18 teenagers, 9 boys and 9 girls. One boy tries to escape and is shot dead. They are taken to a large house where they are told the 'laws'. Thereafter this film is a boring bombardment of filth, degradation, humiliation and perverted sexual activity. The film is loosely split into three sections, the first being called 'Circle of Manias' where a woman named Signora Vaccari (Helene Surgere) tells extremely unerotic stories of how she was abused by a paedophile Priest when she was seven and her first experience as a prostitute when she was nine as the men in charge eagerly listen on and masturbate or get someone to for them, boy or girl as it doesn't matter to them. One of the teenage girls commits suicide. We also get the 'pleasure' of seeing various other types of torture and humiliation as people are raped, lead around on dog leads and made to eat food with razors hidden inside. Next it's 'Cirle of Sh*t'. It does exactly what it says on the tin, Signora Maggi (Elsa De Giorgi) tells a story about how a client of hers ate her excrement and so the powers that be decide to give it a try. They make everyone eat certain things and collect their waste and present it all at dinner for everyone to eat, it's as disgusting as it sounds and it's filmed in such a emotionless way like it's normal. We are also 'treated' to a who's bum is best contest, the four men in charge walk around and inspect their prisoners bottoms and have to decide who's is best. Some funny dialogue here as they discuss things like weight and elasticity! Oh, there's also a golden shower scene where a guy makes a teenage girl urinate on his face and in his mouth, nice. After the men in charge find out that a lot of their prisoners are breaking the laws the film goes into the 'Circle of Blood'. This is the part where they torture and kill various boys and girls for their crimes. A scalping, burning nipples and genitals, gouging eyes out and hanging are some of the methods used as the men in charge partake, watch and/or masturbate. Then the film just sort of ends suddenly. Co-written and directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini this is one messed up film. There are plenty of reviews of this film around that try and uncover lots of different meanings and try to justify what appears on screen with intellectual reasoning but I can't really see all that arty stuff in a film. I see what is presented in front of me, simple as that. What this film is is really dull and boring for starters, it goes on for too long and is actually quite slow. None of the characters were developed to the extent I would like and most are there just to be used and abused by freaks. It's notorious controversial moments are there for sure and still retain the power to shock even after 30 odd years. Some of this has to be seen and heard to be believed. I can appreciate it as a thought provoking film that has definite power but if you want entertainment look elsewhere, and for me that's what's watching films is all about. The photography is quite flat and static but the production design was nice. There is virtually no music during the film either. I won't be in any hurry to watch it again anytime soon but I'm sure large parts of this film will stay in my memory for a long time. Shocking, controversial, offencive, repellent and distressing describe Salo well, as does dull, boring and ultimately pointless. I would never recommend this film to anyone I know, avoid unless your completely sure you want to see it.",5,3,7,12 February 2005
Total Recall," 'If I'm not me then who the hell am I?' As already mentioned, definitely one of Arnie's best.
","Total Recall is set in the future where interplanetary space travel is a reality, on Earth lowly construction worker Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has strange dreams involving Mars & decides to go to a company called Rekall who implant virtual memories of holidays in peoples minds. Doug ask's for a complete set of memories for a trip to Mars, the implant goes wrong & Doug has a violent reaction. The guy's at Rekall put him in a cab & send him away, then Doug's day goes from bad to worse when his friend from work tries to kill him, his wife (Sharon Stone) tries to kill him too & he learns that the evil ruler of Mars Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) has wiped his memory & dumped him on Earth. As Doug struggles to discover his own identity he is thrown into a war between Cohaagen & rebel terrorists on Mars as people try to kill him left, right & center, but which side is he working for & why...Directed by Paul Verhoeven I'll get straight to the point & say that I think Total Recall is a brilliant sci-fi actioner & easily one of Schwarzenegger's best films. The script by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon & Gary Goldman was based on the short story 'We Can Remember it For You Wholesale' by famed sci-fi writer Philip K.Dick is a surprisingly intelligent & thoughtful sci-fi story with all the bangs, shoot-outs & violence associated with director Verhoeven & star Schwarzenegger which complement each other better than one might expect. The film moves along at a nice pace, it's never boring & the story is intricate & complex enough to keep you alert & concentrating, this is far from the by-the-numbers one man army action flick that Schwarzenegger is known for. The film manages to keep you guessing, it's well written enough to have several potential outcomes & it manages to make yourself doubt whether what's happening is real or just a complete dream. Of course this being an action flick there's plenty of it & Total Recall is also a very violent film, this is the type of 90's flick where it is necessary to use excessive force & gory violence at all times. The character's are interesting, the dialogue is good with some typical Schwarzenegger one liners like saying 'consider that a divorce' after shooting his wife in the head! I don't know what else to say really, Total Recall is just a great film with loads of violence, nudity, fights, memorable villains & a surprisingly good sci-fi plot that you need to see for yourself.Apparently David Cronenberg was originally set to direct but eventual director Verhoeven does a fine job here, he is his usual uncompromising self as Total Recall is packed full of gore, mutant freak hookers, midget hookers, nudity & general excess. He doesn't know the meaning of the word subtle & that's just another reason why I love Total Recall so much. The special effects are very impressive, from expansive shots of the Martian landscape to huge reactors under the surface of Mars this looks good even now. The Jonnycab scenes are hilarious, the futuristic vision created here seems plausible & as such the film hasn't dated at all although if I was being picky why weren't the glass used for domes on Mars bullet proof & where were the security services as Quaid & Victor shoot at each other in the subway? What happened to the guy's behind the desk watching the X-ray machine? They had guns, where did they go? In the mid 80's the story which Total Recall was based upon was brought by Italian hack producer Dino de Laurentiis, he tried to make the film starring Patrick Swayze & directed by Bruce Beresford & sets were actually built in Australia but the shoot was cancelled when de Laurentiis' company went bankrupt & that's when Schwarzenegger stepped in & convinced the brass at Carolco to buy the script & let him star.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 Total Recall looks the business, it's sets, special effects, production design, rousing music by Jerry Goldsmith are all top notch although Rob Bottin's special make-up effects are strangely average & don't bear close scrutiny. Shot in Mexico all of the cast & crew went down with food poisoning expect Schwarzenegger who had his food specially flown in from the US... The acting is pretty good, Schwarzenegger is OK, Sharon Stone looks nice while Ronny Cox & Michael Ironside play their bad guy roles with relish.Total Recall is just a totally fantastic film, it's more than just an Arnie shoot-em-up, it has neat sci-fi ideas behind it, plenty of excess violence & is just a great film. Definitely recommended. Followed by the TV series Total Recall 2070 (1999) which ran for 22 episodes.",8,4,8,21 September 2007
The Descent," 'Chicks with picks.' Better than I expected but it ain't perfect...
","The Descent opens with three friends, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) & Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) white water rafting down some very British looking river. Sarah while on her way home with her husband Paul (Oliver Milburn) & young daughter Jessica (Molly Kayll) is involved in a road accident in which she is the only survivor. It's now 'One Year Later' & the girls are planning another adventure outing & meet up together in the heart of an American mountain range. They are joined by three more women, the annoying Holly (Nora-Jane No one), Beth (Alex Reid) & Sam (MyAnna Buring) who all set off for some underground caverns. Once they arrive they enter via a large hole in the ground, the only way out is to negotiate the passageways & tunnels. In traditional horror film style they quickly become lost & after a cave-in stuck, Juno admits she has brought them to the wrong cave system & one that is unexplored, furthermore she doesn't have a clue how to get out. As they venture deeper & further into the caverns panic & arguing sets in amongst the group, to make matters even worse they are not the only living creatures down there as they have to contend with flesh eating human like monsters...Written & directed by Neil Marshall this UK production has me in two minds. On the one hand I thought certain aspects were better than I expected, while at other times I was disappointed. The script by Marshall, who made another British horror film called Dog Soldiers (2002) which I much prefer, takes what seemed like an eternity to get going & introduce the 'Crawlers'. I couldn't check my watch because I saw it in a cinema but it felt like well over 40 minutes before they showed up, to be fair when they do & The Descent kicks into straight horror then it's top-notch for the rest of it's running time. Until this point The Descent has virtually no horror elements at all, in fact it plays like a disaster film as they become trapped & try to figure a way out, I just can't get over how slow & uneventful this opening 30 plus minutes are. There was always a foreboding atmosphere that this was all building up to something but I went from excited expectation to desperate hope that something, anything that even resembles horror would pop up soon. I hated how Sarah's character suddenly became the female Arnold Schwarzenegger & kicked, punched, outrun, out-thought, stabbed, killed & poked eyes out as these 'Crawlers' couldn't even scratch her! Having said that the end slightly redeems itself. Also prepare to sit through a dark film, very dark. I mean dark as sometimes the screen is almost completely black & it's virtually impossible to see what's happening & bear in mind I saw it on a huge cinema screen. One cramped cave tunnel looks much like any-other so it is sometimes difficult to grasp just where everyone is in relation to everyone else & the location offers little variety. On the positive side, which there are many, Marshall creates some wonderfully atmospheric sequences in particular a scene when Sarah is stuck in a small tunnel which has to be one of the most tension filled & unnerving scenes in a horror film in the past few years. The caverns provide a real feeling of isolation which Marshall uses to his advantage. There are some real genuine scares here as well, I saw it with an audience in a cinema & there were some strong reactions to certain bits. I think we all liked the scene when Marshall first introduces a 'Crawler' via the infra red on a camcorder, you'll know when you see it. There are reasonable amounts of gore but they don't really kick in until the 'Crawlers' show up & they consist mainly of blood spurting & bites although there is a scene where someone's bone is sticking out through their skin, someone has a pick axe stuck through their throat & a cave full of bloody body parts & bones. The special effect are very good & thankfully it doesn't rely on awful CGI for which The Descent deserves another star at least. The 'Crawlers' themselves look a bit cheap at times & just like thin humans really & look almost exactly like Gollum from the Lord of the Ring (2001 - 2003) films. The acting is strong throughout & it was an interesting decision to have an entirely female cast & not a single male except Paul who dies within the first few minutes. Technically The Descent is fine but as I've mentioned the cinematography is somewhat dark & the cave setting became a little dull after a while. Overall I liked The Descent & I think most of the audience I watched it with did too, but unfortunately I just can't stop thinking about that painfully slow opening 30-40 minutes & I don't think I would be in any hurry to watch it again any time soon because of this. Oh, & the aerial shots of the U.S.A. mountain range don't match the ground shots which were filmed in Scotland I believe as the trees are completely different. I think The Descent is a very good horror film but not a brilliant one, but when all said & done I definitely think it's well worth watching so what are you waiting for?",7,6,12,10 July 2005
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Very funny, very witty & very excellent British crime caper.
","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is set in London where four close friends Eddie (Nick Moran), Bacon (Jason Statham), Tom (Jason Flemying) & Soap (Dezter Fletcher) all chip in £25,000 to make up the £100,000 entrance fee to a big high stakes poker game held by hard as nails villain & crime boss 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty). Eddie is an expert poker player & figures he can make each of them a clear £100,00 profit, if they play their cards right (ha!). Unfortunately 'Hatchet' Harry doesn't like losing & cheats, Eddie not only loses the £100,000 but actually ends up owing 'Hatchet' Harry £500,000 after borrowing it from him to continue in the game. 'Hatchet' Harry is not the sort of person you owe money to, Eddie & his friends must find a way to raise a half a million pounds in the next four days or start losing their fingers...This English production was written & directed by Guy Ritchie & has already deservedly reached pretty much classic status, in fact it still resides in the IMDb's top 250 films list over ten years since it was originally released & for me it throughly deserves to be there. It's just a wonderfully entertaining, witty, funny, clever British crime caper with bags of personality & at the time it was made originality although in the ten years since it was released many a British film has ripped it off trying to recreate it's success. There are a few things which make Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels so brilliant. First it's just so funny, I have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels several times now & I laugh my head off every time, the really funny dialogue, the spot on performances, the hilarious one liners, the use of funny cockney rhyming slang & the things which happen along with the often bizarre situations the character's find themselves in means there isn't a scene that goes by where something funny doesn't happen or there isn't some instantly quotable insult or one liner. Secondly the character's are great, they have real depth & the good guy's are very likable so you root for them while the bad guy's are real nasty pieces of work so as a consequence you don't root for them, just the way it should be. Then there's the plot which at the time was fresh, new, original, clever, witty, full of great twists & turns & there's certainly plenty going on which rather improbably all come together at the end in a somewhat far fetched way but when a film is as entertaining, clever & downright funny as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you just tend to go with it. A brilliantly funny British comedy crime caper, one of my favourite films ever & it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Ritchie really injects some style, pace & energy into the film with various tricks which never become gimmicky or intrusive & only help tell a brilliantly story with style, originality & panache. Not only did Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels revolutionise the British crime caper genre with it's story telling but it has also influenced plenty of films since with it's slick editing & visual techniques. There's a fantastic soundtrack too, I really can't think of one bad thing to say about Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels which is pretty high praise in itself as I am not easily pleased. There's a fair amount of violence but nothing overly graphic & a lot of it is played for laughs as is the bad language & profanity of which there is a lot. In fact I don't there is a single scene which doesn't involve the use of strong language at some point.According to the IMDb Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels had a budget of about £960,000 which is simply amazing, a film this good & this stylish for less than a million? Shot on location in & around London Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels were the film debuts of both ex footballer Vinnie Jones & Jason Statham who have both done very well off the back of it. During the final credits the film is dedicated to ex bare knuckle fighter Lenny McClean who played Barry the Baptist & who died of cancer shortly before the film premiered. The acting is great from all involved, there's boyish charm to downright menacing criminal unpleasantness.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a brilliantly funny, witty, clever & entertaining British crime caper that is a true genre great & one of my own personal favourite films ever. Ritchie followed Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels up with the equally brilliant British crime caper Snatch (2000) a couple of years later.",9,14,18,5 March 2008
The Happening," I kind of liked it in spite of it's bad reputation.
","The Happening starts early one morning in Central Park in New York City where people suddenly start committing suicide for no apparent reason, this strange outbreak of suicides continues to spread throughout the city, the state & the Eastern seaboard. High school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg), his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) along with his best friend Julian (John Leguizamo) & his young daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) flee nearby Philadelphia but become stranded when the train service is discontinued. As the speculation grows over what is causing the mass outbreak of suicide it's seem the only thing known for sure is that it is caused by an airborne toxin, as the friends try to stay ahead of the toxin & survive it becomes increasingly difficult...Apparently having the working titles Green Planet & The Green Effect this American Indian co-production was written, produced & directed by M. Night Shyamalan & seems to polarize opinion with some incredibly scathing & unforgiving reviews amidst some kinder ones. While The Happening isn't perfect & it can sometimes be a very frustrating viewing experience I did actually quite like it for it's outlandish story the likes of which I have never seen before, surely the originality that The Happening offers is to be applauded & encouraged rather than ridiculed otherwise why are filmmakers &/or studios going to make any other type of horror film than teen slashers? For a start I really liked the central concept behind The Happening, the idea of some toxin that causes people to commit suicide is just great & it's a shame Shyamalan didn't have the balls to build on a terrific & memorable opening sequence showing people plunging hair pins into their necks & the startling scene of construction workers jumping off high scaffolding like lemmings. The film ditches the big city mayhem & fun for endless scenes of Wahlberg & family walking around the countryside far too early & the film suffers as a result. Just not enough happens really & I also wish it had been a bit gorier with some real bite to the suicide scenes. The film never really confirms anything & the main message that The Happening is trying to convey is that science doesn't have all the answers, there are things we simply don't & will never understand although I do like the idea of the environment fighting back against us humans who are destroying it. The script suggests terrorism, pollution, secret government experiments gone out of control & even nuclear power plants but I like the nature fighting back scenario the best although it is left open for interpretation. The character of Elliot is also a refreshing change as he's not some all action American hero but actually feels like a normal guy most of the time. On the downside it is slow going at times & the none event of an ending is very frustrating & there's no trademark Shyamalan twist in sight.I picked this up on second hand Blu-ray & it said it contained scenes too shocking for cinemas or something which is odd since it's a fairly tame film, a woman plunges her hairpin into her neck, there are some dead bodies seen, a guy has both his arms ripped off by lions, a couple of people get shot & a cool scene in which a guy lays on the ground & lets a huge lawnmower run over him. There should have been more scene like these. The film does have a somewhat eerie atmosphere to it & there's a great scene which an avenue of trees is seen with people hanging from each one in a creepy moment, there's a cool car crash & an amusing part where Wahlberg talks to a plastic plant.Apparently taking just 44 days to shoot The Happening is said to have been shot in sequence & it has nice glossy production values although the colour looks slightly bleached on my Blu-ray, the sky is white rather than blue for instance. The acting is alright, Wahlberg is OK while the interestingly named Zooey Deschanel is very pretty to look at & John Leguizamo has nothing more than a glorified cameo.The Happening has a bad reputation but I liked it, I liked it themes & ideas & central concept although the execution wasn't always the best which does hurt it. This should have been gorier, had more of a satisfying ending & less time spent with Wahlberg walking around fields. I seemed to like it more than most though & would recommend it to those looking for something different.",6,6,12,5 August 2009
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A wasted opportunity.
","Mr. & Mrs. Smith is set in New York where married couple John (Brad Pitt) & Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) live out an unhappy existence together, what they don't know however is that they are both top secret highly trained assassins who work for different shadowy organisations. Unfortunately their respective employers discover they are married & send them both on the same mission in an attempt to have them both kill each other, the plan fails & Mr. & Mrs. Smith team up to take on their employers who want them dead at all costs...Directed by Doug Liman this has to be one of the very worst big budget overblown Hollywood action adventure films ever made, I personally hated it. The script by Simon Kinberg apparently went through over fifty drafts with at least nine writers working on it during it's production & one has to say it's sort of noticeable since it's a mess. I found it impossible to relate to anyone or anything in Mr. & Mrs. Smith, the fact they two leads are ruthless assassins who seem to make a sh*t load of money & somehow are oblivious to what the other does (for five or six years) is so far fetched & fanciful they might as well have been aliens from Mars for all the reality on show here. Then there's the fact I just didn't like either character at all, the secondary character's are given absolutely nothing to do & various character's were actually cut from the film completely including the final showdown with Mr. & Mrs. Smith's bosses. I also found it lacking in decent action scenes, there's a few explosions & some really dull shoot-outs where the predictably invincible Mr. & Mrs. Smith shoot & kill all the bad guy's without getting so much as a scratch on themselves despite having rocket launchers fired at them, explosions going off around them & being significantly out numbered. Also, when they do get shot repeatedly it's revealed they both have bullet proof vests on which is fine but why didn't the otherwise heavily armed bad guy's wear bullet proof vests as well? This is just a lame, boring, silly, dull, stupid & utterly predictable waste of $110,000,000. As an action film it doesn't satisfy, as a comedy film it's not funny, as a romance it fails & as a drama it's so far removed from reality they might as well have cast two Teletubbies in the leading roles!Director Liman had a huge budget at his disposable so how he managed to turn in such an unexciting film as this is beyond me. Seriously everything was here for a cracking action adventure, the huge budget, the A-list Hollywood stars, the backing of a major studio & a potentially fun story but nothing works in my opinion. There's a mildly entertaining car chase which dwells more on a domestic argument between Mr. & Mrs. Smith than actual vehicular mayhem & an OK CGI computer effect of the Smith's house blowing up (yes, despite being only a few feet away they get up & walk away without so much as a bruise) but surprisingly very little else to get the blood pumping. Maybe I'm expecting too much but a pointlessly one sided shoot-out in a superstore at the end just isn't enough to get me excited. A mixture of real stunts & CGI computer effects you can tell the difference & the scene when the women slide across New York skyscrapers on wires is just ridiculous. Probably the most memorable part of Mr. & Mrs. Smith is Angelina Jolie as a dominatrix which is shown in all the trailers, unfortunately the scene in question in reality lasts for all of 30 seconds. In fact I'd say Mr. & Mrs. Smith is one of those films which makes for a brilliant trailer, the sort of film which give publicists wet dreams as there are lots of great looking moments to edit into a three minute trailer but when you watch the finished film those are the only good bits in it!With an obscene budget of about $110,000,000 I can't really see where the money went although Jolie & Pitt didn't exactly come cheap, the action really isn't that good & there's not that much of it either. Nicole Kidman was originally cast as Mrs. Smith but dropped out while Gwen Stefani, Catherine Zeta-Jones & Cate Blanchett were also considered before the terrible Jolie got the part & was reportedly paid an absolutely criminal $20,000,000 for a truly awful performance. Meanwhile Johnny Depp was cast as Mr. Smith but later turned it down & Will Smith was also considered before Pitt got the part & was also paid an extortionate $20,000,000 for turning in a terrible performance. Nice work if you can get it I suppose. The rest of the cast barely figure & have nothing to do at all.Mr. & Mrs. Smith could have been brilliant, in the hands of a decent action director I'm sure the $110,000,000 could have been put to good use to make an exciting & fun James Bond type action adventure, as it is were left with this boring family friendly crap mixture of action, romance & comedy. So much potential yet so much disappointment.",3,6,13,12 November 2007
Psycho," Classic Hitchcock. Maybe won't impress the MTV generation though.
","Psycho starts in the town Tuscon in Phoenix where secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is given $40,000 to deposit by her boss George Lowery (Vaughn Taylor) but she decides to steal it, Marion drives off across California where she stops at the Bates Motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) & rents a room although it would turn out to be the last thing she ever did...Produced & directed by Alfred Hitchcock Psycho has become one of the most well known films ever & it's iconic & often imitated shower sequence one of the most recognisable few minutes in cinematic history, does this automatically make it the classic the whole world & it's brother claim though? I liked Psycho for sure but I think it was a film of it's time, it was a groundbreaking film by all accounts but I wasn't even born when this was originally released & I would imagine Psycho would have more impact back then than it does now. The shocking plot twists, the way the star of the film is suddenly killed, the psychology behind Norman's motives & it's realistic approach to violence & murder probably made Psycho a groundbreaking cinematic event when it came out in 1960 but viewing it for the first time in 2007 it's undeniably a good film but one I didn't cream my pants over, unlike some it seems. I think it's a very good film, a film which I would call a thriller more than a horror & I thought it was entertaining but not outstanding. Because the shower scene is so well know it's not going to shock anyone the way it did back in 1960 & the other aspects of the story are so well known the same thing applies. Don't get me wrong as that isn't Psycho's fault in itself but, well I just knew what was going to happen & that can't be good.Director Hitchcock does a great job here, he keeps the camera right in people's faces which gives it a claustrophobic feel. This is pretty stylish & is very atmospheric which the black and white photography really helps. He keeps things moving along, the character's & dialogue are good & it passes the time harmlessly enough. The violence is tame by todays standards.According to the IMDb Psycho had an estimated budget of $806,947 which seems like a very specific number for an 'estimate' don't you think? It's well made with good production values throughout. The acting is also very good from all involved.Psycho is a great film & I'm not saying it isn't but I didn't think it was the absolute classic many say it is & to an extent it's become a victim of it's own success as everyone knows the story already, definitely worth a watch all the same. Followed by Psycho II (1983), Psycho III (1986), the made-for-TV Bates Motel (1987) & Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) & it was remade virtually shot-for-shot in colour as Psycho (1998).",7,2,9,17 July 2007
Rosemary's Baby," 'He has his Father's eyes.' Entertaining psychological horror.
","Rosemary's Baby starts as a young seemingly very in love couple named Rosemary (Mia Farrow) & Guy Woodhouse (John Casavetes) decide to take an apartment in a Manhattan complex, despite it's rather notorious history. Rosemary meets another young woman named Terry Gionoffrio (Victoria Vetri as Angela Dorian) who that night is found dead on the street below her apartment, presumably having committed suicide. Rosemary & Guy both meet the old people Terry was staying with during the aftermath, Minnie (Ruth Gordon who won an Oscar for her performance) & Roman Castevet (Sidney Blackmer) who start to show a great interest in the young couple. Suddenly Guy's acting career takes off in unfortunate circumstances when a fellow actor goes blind overnight & Guy is given the role. One night Rosemary has a nightmare about being raped by a creature of some sort while her neighbour's & Guy look on, but she wakes up the next morning in good health apart from some scratches which don't really bother her. Shortly after this Rosemary is informed that she is pregnant, both her & Guy are over joyed. But the Castevet's still show an unhealthy interest in Rosemary & her baby, they persuade Guy to make Rosemary see a different Doctor, Dr. Abraham Sapirstein (Ralph Bellamy), make Rosemary drink all sorts of strange stuff & control her entire life. A friend of Rosemary's, Edward 'Hutch' Hutchinson (Maurice Evans) suspects that the Castevet's may not be as harmless as they seem but mysteriously lapses into a coma & dies. Rosemary has no-one as she believes Guy is in on the conspiracy which threatens both Rosemary & her unborn baby...Written & directed by Roman Polanski I thought Rosemary's Baby was a solid piece of psychological horror but is perhaps a little slow for todays generation. The script by Polanski based on the novel by Ira Levin of the same name is a little slow & I found my patience wearing a bit thin at times but I must admit Rosemary's Baby is quite gripping & involving, it's a film which rewards patience & the effort it takes to watch it properly. Rosemary's Baby is a complex film that requires thought on the part of the viewer to fully appreciate it, otherwise it will just come across a boring overlong film with no explosions, swearing or special effects. The detailed & intricate screenplay builds the characters up nicely which is essential because we, the viewer that is, need to have some sort of emotional attachment to them for the films climax to be successful in the way Polanski intended. While the pace of Rosemary's Baby is undoubtedly slow it never lapses into boredom as we witness & experience Rosemary's paranoia grow as the film progresses, it is consistently interesting & provides good solid thoughtful entertainment. There is no gore in Rosemary's Baby except a bloody head but it's a film which doesn't need cheap gore effects to hold it's audience, it uses good storytelling instead. There is some nudity too, but not much. Technically Rosemary's Baby is very good, it has dated a bit but nowhere near as much as you might expect a film from 1968 to have. The cinematography by William A. Fraker is solid & does a good job of capturing the streets of New York & the creepy apartment block, Polanski's direction is tight, effective & accomplished throughout. The acting is very strong by all of the cast with Farrow being a particular stand-out as she suffer's a spiral descent into her own personal hell. Overall I liked Rosemary's Baby as a one time watch, it was interesting & provided one of the most famous ending in horror film history which doesn't disappoint as it hits all the right notes. Having said that at well over the two hour mark I won't be in any hurry to watch it again, ever probably as it's a little too slow for my tastes & especially since I know what's going to happen. A good film if your prepared to put the time & effort in but maybe not quite the classic many make out. Definitely worth watching particularly since it probably turns up on TV a lot & can be brought dirt cheap on DVD these days.",7,3,9,11 July 2005
War of the Worlds," Better than I expected but still a bit hollow.
","War of the Worlds starts in New York where the ex-wife of docks worker Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) drops his two kids Robbie (Justin Chatwin) & Rachel (Dakota Fanning) off for the weekend, shortly after a strange storm happens & lighting hits the ground in the same spot several times & afterwards nothing electrical works. Unsure of what's happening Ray goes outside & witnesses a huge alien tripod machine rise from the ground & start destroying everything in it's path, Ray manages to get back home & drive off with Robbie & Rachel as New York is systematically destroyed. News of alien tripods emerging from the ground all over the world reaches Ray & it becomes a desperate bid for survival against the alien invaders as he tries to protect his children & find their mother as the world literally crumbles around them as the invaders obliterate everything in their path...Directed by Steven Spielberg this big budget adaptation of the classic 1889 sci-fi novel by H.G. Wells (it's an adaptation of an original novel & not a remake of an original film in my opinion) that had already been turned into a successful film by producer George Pal as The War of the Worlds (1953) & I have to say it was better than I had expected it to be. Despite being called a classic the original 1953 The War of the Worlds isn't that faithful to H.G. Wells novel whereas this one is, from the invaders using tripods (something technically beyond the makers back in 1953 & merely chopped the legs off & turned them into flying saucers) to the harvesting of humans to the red weed like growth to the attack on a boat to a dark scene in which the hero has to kill another person to save himself & his daughter. At it's central core the original The War of the Worlds had an old fashioned romance between the two leads where here it's all about a desperate man trying to save his kids & as such we have a small cute little girl for sympathy value so the main focus of the films are different & the social climate of the time is also different so here Spielberg draws parallels between the alien invaders knocking down buildings & indiscriminately killing millions of people & terrorism & a few dialogue scenes directly refer to it. There's a fair amount of ambiguity here too, the word alien is never used & while H.G. Wells called them Martians it's hinted here they come from far further afield than that. It's never really explained what the red weeds are for or why they harvest humans but I didn't mind that too much, the idea that the alien tripods have been buried underground for maybe hundreds of thousands of years is mentioned but never elaborated upon for some reason. At almost two hours it feels shorter & after a deceptively normal & sedate opening once it gets going it never lets up with the alien menace an ever present one & it all comes to a rather sudden conclusion that feels a little abrupt & disappointing Spielberg has a family friendly happy ending cop-out although having said that the sombre lack of any heroic patriotic triumphantlism is refreshing.The special effects & CGI is amazingly good & there are some outstanding set-pieces from the initial destruction of New York to the attack on a ferry to a cool moment when a speeding train on a track is seen to be totally engulfed by fire to the appearance of the aliens themselves. The alien design is alright, I could have done without the big bug eyed cute face but they look alright & the effects are great. There's some good suspense in the basement scene, the action scenes are exciting & there's good tension as well but it does feel a little bit empty overall as the entire film is told from the perspective of Ray. The alien tripods look great & are certainly memorable. Apparently with a seventy two day schedule filming started only seven months prior to release.With a supposed budget of about $132,000,000 this was mega budget & it show's with amazing effects & production design. The acting is pretty good, Tom Cruise is fine, Morgan Freeman narrates the opening & closing scenes while the stars of the original The War of the Worlds Gene Barry & Ann Robinson have small cameos.War of the Worlds was better than I expected & a great big budget CGI filled sci-fi epic that I enjoyed but somehow did feel a little empty overall. Zero budget specialists The Asylum made the awful War of the Worlds (2005) with C. Thomas Howell & a sequel War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave (2008) which is also crap.",6,6,12,13 March 2010
30 Days of Night," Throughly entertaining horror film with Vampires.
","30 Days of Night is set in the (very) small town of Barrow in Alaska which has the distinction of being the northern most town in the U.S., it is isolated in 80 miles of road-less wilderness which is cut off & plunged into total darkness all day every winter for thirty days straight. During this time the population of Barrow drops from 563 to 152 as most of the townspeople head to somewhere more hospitable for the winter, the few that do stay this particular winter are in for a rough time as a group of blood drinking Vampire like creatures descend on the town in order to kill everyone & drink their blood. A small group of assorted survivors lead by Sheriff Eben Olesen (Josh Hartnett) & his wife Stella (Melissa George) must try to hide & make it through the 30 days of night until helps arrives in the form of the sun...This New Zealand & American co-production was directed by David Slade & this horror film did pretty good box-office back in 2007 & I have to say I rather liked it, I didn't think it was any sort of classic but I definitely liked it. The script by Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie & Brian Nelson was based on the Dark Horse graphic novel of the same name by Niles & is a pretty grim 'base under siege' type horror thriller that is best described as a cross between The Thing (1982) & John Carpenter's Vampires (1998) (coincidently both of which were directed by John Carpenter which means absolutely nothing, come to think of it it's not to dissimilar to Ghosts of Mars (2001) also directed by Carpenter...) as it's set in a freezing snow covered isolated location & features hordes of blood drinking vampires, it certainly takes itself very seriously & there isn't a light hearted moment in it but it is quite often very intense & I did like it's conviction. The character's are slightly better than what one would expect, both Sheriff Oleson & his wife have personality which makes the downbeat ending a bit of a bummer. I mean after watching a fairly grim & intense Vampire flick for 100 odd minutes featuring plenty of death & destruction I would have liked a bit more cheerful ending but that's just me. There's enough action & gore to satisfy hardened horror addicts although not all aspects of the story are as good as I would have liked. For instance who were the Vampires? Where did they come from? If it was blood they were after why did they kill people in such a way all their blood was splattered over the wall or floor? Why did that main Vampire at the end fight Sheriff Oleson? Why did all the other Vampires just stand there & watch as their leader was killed? Why didn't they then kill Oleson?Director Slade does a very good job here & films with style in full 2:35:1 widescreen, some of the opening shots of the Alaskan horizon as the sun sets over the snow covered landscape looks great & he thankfully keeps his camera nice & steady so we can actually see the carnage. I loved the aerial shot from above the town as the camera moved over the main street as the vampires attack, there are huge red splodges of blood everywhere, fires burning & Vampires attacking people all viewed in one continuous cool looking shot from the sky! The special effects are impressive, both the CGI computer variety & the more traditional prosthetic make-up effects sort. The Vampire creatures look very good & quite intimidating, I love how they walk around with old blood stains from their victims on their faces & clothes & don't bother to wash it off. There's some good gore here as well, there is plenty of blood splatter with chopped off heads, decapitations, slashed & bitten out throats, gunshot wounds including Vampires having their heads literally shot off, blood drinking & a real crowd pleasing moment when a huge trench is used to carve up several Vampires as well as a cool scene at the end when a Vampire falls into a masher & is suitably mashed. The film has a good atmosphere & a real sense of isolation, there's some nice jump out of your seat moments too.With a supposed budget of about $32,000,000 30 Days of Night is well made with high production values. Although set entirely within the snow covered confines of Alaska in the U.S. 30 Days of Night was in fact filmed entirely in New Zealand. The acting is good from all involved, in case any football fans from the UK are wondering the main Vampire played by Ben Foster is not the same Ben Foster who is currently one of Manchester United's goalkeepers! Credit where credit is due Melissa George is nice & easy on the eye too.30 Days of Night is a really good horror thriller that I enjoyed a lot, the story isn't quite as tight as I would have liked (how did that kid who popped up at the end survive for so long?) but it makes for good late night entertainment which might even give you a few scares. Followed by the made-for-TV mini-series 30 Days of Night: Blood Trails (2007).",7,15,25,22 January 2008
Man on Fire," Reasonable thriller but far, far, far, far, far, far, far too long.
","Man on Fire starts as troubled ex-special forces agent John Creasey (Denzel Washington) is hired by Lisa (Radha Mitchell) & Samuel (Marc Anthony) as a bodyguard to protect their young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico city. While out with Pita an armed team of gangsters kidnap Pita & seriously injure Creasey, while in hospital recovering from his life threatening wounds the ransom drop goes horribly wrong & a corrupt police official steals the $10 million ransom & the kidnappers nephew is shot dead in the process. Everyone is unhappy & the kidnappers kill Pita in retribution, Lisa & Samuel are distraught while Creasey when he finds out swears revenge on those who arranged the kidnapping or profited from it. Creasey tools himself up with some serious firepower & sets his sights on the kidnappers, people will die...This American British co-production was produced & directed by Tony Scott with both Michael Bay & Antoine Fuqua turning it down, as straight ahead action revenge thriller Man on Fire is alright but there are one or two glaring problems that prevent it from an unreserved recommendation. The biggest problem for me is the just shy of two & a half hour running time, to be honest it's a fairly simple story & somehow the makers have stretched to breaking point. If you examine the film not that much happens, man meets girl, girl is all cute & stops him from committing suicide & binge drinking, girl gets kidnapped, man loses it & wants revenge, there are one or two minor twists about double crosses but basically that's it & it takes up to the fiftieth minute before Pita is kidnapped. Now while the build-up is alright & obviously a lot of time is spent on the ever growing relationship between Creasey & Pita it does get a little tiring & at times they seem like an old married couple with the young Pita coming across like a seasoned psychologist at times, to me the friendship was getting a little weird at times. Man on Fire is slow, very slow. I also hated the ending, the twist that Pita is still alive sort of dilutes everything that has gone before, all the emotion & blood spilt is sort of tainted with the revelation & in an otherwise gritty & uncompromising film seems like an attempt at some sort of happy ending where the cute little kid survived. It felt wrong. Having said that it's a solid enough thriller, the whole revenge plot is a solid base, the character's are good & the running time means they are fleshed out to sometimes unnecessary lengths & there are one or two fairly brutal moments.I hated the way man on Fire was shot, the quick editing, the bleached mess out with colours, the shaky hand held look, the twitchy camera & generally the style of Man on Fire is everything that I hate about modern action films all rolled into one. This is an eyesore as far as I am concerned & it becomes frustrating to watch. Although not that graphic there's a fair bit of violence including shoot-outs & a couple of torture scenes. There's a couple of exploding cars, a crashed car & an exploding nightclub but little in the way of spectacular set-pieces as it goes for a more low key gritty more realistic if you will feel. This is actually a remake of the Italian French co-produced film Man on Fire (1987) with both film being based on the novel by A.J. Quinnell.With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 this has good production values the Mexican locations are used quite nicely but the look of the film is just horrible but that's down to editing & film-making techniques. The acting is good, Denzel is good as usual in a role originally offered to the likes of Robert De Niro, Will Smith, Tom Cruise & Bruce Willis who all turned it down. Marlon Brando was the original choice to play Rayburn but Christopher Walken is always a safe bet although he is rather wasted in a bit part role.Man on Fire is a decent enough action thriller that simply goes on for too long & a cop out ending where the kid lives doesn't help either. Overall if you have two & a half hours to waste then Man on Fire is violent enough & is alright but it does have flaws.",5,0,3,22 May 2010
Army of Darkness," Disappointing third Evil Dead film.
","Army of Darkness starts where Evil Dead II (1987) finishes with Ash (Bruce Campbell) finding himself stranded in the thirteenth century after he was transported back in time, there he is mistaken for an enemy warrior by Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) & his men & taken prisoner. Back at Lord Arthur's castle Ash learns that unspeakable evils are terrorising Lord Arthur's people, in order to get back to the twentieth century & to rid the land of the evil Deadites Ash must undertake a quest to find the Necronomicon, or the Book of the Dead as Ash know's it. Ash has to go it alone as he faces trouble from the evil dead & the book itself along the way as he tries to get back home...Co-edited, co-written & directed by Sam Raimi this is the third film in his Evil Dead franchise, also known under the title Army of Darkness: The Medieval Dead & shot under the working title of Evil Dead 3 the actual Evil Dead title apparently wasn't eventually able to be used due to copyright & legal problems caused by the collapse of the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group who financed Evil Dead II & co-produced this while it was still in business. To be honest with a distinct change in title there's a distinct change in tone as well since Army of Darkness simply didn't feel like an Evil Dead film to me or at least what I felt an Evild Dead film should feel like. While the first two Evil Dead films were classic black comedy horror films with with lots of gore Army of Darkness tones the gore & horror down to virtually nothing & instead ups the slapstick comedy & visual gags to an almost unbearable level & as such Army of Darkness feels more like a Three Stooges (writer & director Raimi has often stated The Three Stooges were a major influence on him) outing featuring a few monsters. To be fair the film is quite likable & there are a few moments which might make some laugh but for me there were far more misses than hits in the joke & gags department & I really miss the horror & gore of the previous Evil Dead films. The films plot is also very poor when analyzed, Ash's quest doesn't seem that difficult & why didn't either Lord Arthur & his men or the Deadites retrieve the Necronomicon already? If they knew where the book was & how to safely get why didn't they? Why did they need to send Ash? Why didn't the bad guy's grab it already? The romance between Ash & Sheila feels pointless & why did they change the start & make it different to the end of Evil Dead II where Ash shoots that flying monster?Confusingly Army of Darkness surely must be a contender for the film with the most alternate versions, there are theatrical cuts, TV versions, director's cuts all containing/missing/adding/removing unique material & to add to the confusion there's two different endings which seem to get used almost at random depending where you live. To be honest the differences are purely cosmetic, there's no change of story between most of the different version apart from the ending which is substantially altered. Most of the deleted/added scenes are just extension's of existing sequences or minor added scenes that don't affect the story too much. While I didn't find Army of darkness funny or particularly clever I was also disappointed with it's very overblown jovial atmosphere as opposed to the intense horror & gore of the previous Evil Dead films, to be honest there's no horror or gore here to speak of & this would surely rate as a 'PG' these days. Made at a time before CGI computer effects most of the ambitious effects sequences are achieved through matte paintings, composites & stop-motion animation. The stop-motion animated skeletons remind heavily of Ray Harryhausen's brilliant sequence from Jason and the Argonauts (1963) also featuring skeletons. The film has a fun visual style with Raimi using all sorts of camera tricks & editing techniques.With a supposed $11,000,000 budget Army of darkness was by far the biggest budgeted Evil Dead film to date & Raimi uses the money to create an all out war film set in a medieval fantasy setting culminating in an epic battle between good & evil. The film bombed at the box-office & it's not difficult to see why to be honest. The acting is alright, Bruce Campbell has screen presence & is likable in this as he delivers the one-liners with aplomb while Bridget Fonda has a small role at the start.Army of Darkness is occasionally fun & it certainly moves along like a rocket with barely a dull moment but somehow it just didn't do it for me, I didn't find it that funny & I really missed the intense horror, monsters, slime & gore of the previous films. Wathable but very silly & not entirely satisfying. According to the IMDb another sequel titled Evil Dead IV (2011) is currently in development.",4,7,15,14 February 2009
Scream 2," 'I ain't payin' 7.50 to see no Sandra Bullock S*it.' Entertaining sequel.
","Scream 2 starts with the premiere of the horror film 'Stab'. Stab is a film based upon the events of the first Scream (1996), a young couple named Maureen Evans (Jada Pinkett Smith as Jada Pinkett) & Phil Stevens (Omar Epps) attend the showing where both are brutally murdered by an unknown masked assailant. The murders are widely reported & it's not long before Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) becomes aware of the fatalities. Chief Lewis Hartly (Lewis Arquette) tries to calm the press who include Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) complete with new cameraman Joel Jones (Duane Martin) once again back trying to break a huge story & thus find fame & fortune. Dwight 'Dewey' Riley (David Arquette) also shows up out of concern for Sidney, Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) who survived the events of the original Scream is still around & to make things even more like old times Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) turns up who just happens to have spent the last year of his life in jail after he was wrongly accused by Sidney. Sidney's roommate Hallie McDaniel (Elise Neal) tries to cheer her up by taking Sidney to a party that very night, unfortunately Cici Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has to stay behind on her own & becomes the next victim. As the bodies pile up so do the suspects & once again Sidney must unmask the killer or pay the ultimate price...Directed by Wes Craven like the original who also has a small blink & you'll miss him cameo I thought Scream 2 was good solid entertaining fun & a worthy sequel. The script again by Kevin Williamson who also has a small cameo doesn't stray too far from the original's roots in terms of tone & feel, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Everything you expect is here, the self parody, the witty one liners, making fun of the slasher clichés & genre all done with a nice affection & considerable humour, there is a nice running gag about film sequels, their rules & the fact that their always inferior. Scream 2 moves along at a nice pace even if it could have done with a couple more murders & a few scenes maybe should have been cut or shortened because at 2 hours my interest started to wain towards the end. On the negative side it's not a big departure from the original & the ending which felt very familiar if you know what I mean was a bit of a let down, an anti-climax as it were. But then we all know that it wasn't the end was it? Yet another sequel & the last to date Scream 3 (2000) made an appearance 3 years later. Having said that I doubt you will guess the killers identity. The kills are surprising not very graphic apart from one slit throat which was a bit of a disappointment as one character rightly points out the death scenes in sequels should be bigger & bloodier, Wes Craven I hope your listening! The characters are all very likable & the cast, many of whom return from the original, do a good job. Any film with Courtney Cox, Neve Campbel & Sarah Michelle Gellar can't be all bad can it, eh lads? Technically scream 2 is very polished & well made with nice production values but with a budget of $24,000,000 that's the least I expect. One curious thing about Scream 2 was the fact that I found it a very bright film, a lot of it takes place during the day & in brightly lit rooms for which Scream 2 probably loses some atmosphere. Overall I liked Scream 2 a lot, it's great entertainment, it's not too gory & it's funny especially if your a horror fan because you'll understand & appreciate the jokes & swipes at the genre. Definitely worth a watch.",7,0,5,25 July 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Excellent telling of Bram Stoker's novel.
","Dracula starts in Transylvania during 1462 where Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) goes to battle, hearing of Dracula's death his bride Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) commits suicide. However Dracula wasn't dead & upon hearing of Elisabeta's suicide he renounces God... Jump forward to 'London 1897, Four Centuries Later' where Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) is instructed to travel to Transylvania to conclude the sale of Carfax Abbey in London to Count Dracula who is now a member of the blood drinking undead, Harker has to leave behind his fiancé Mina Murry (Winona Ryder again) but does so & sets off. Once there Dracula imprisons Harker in his castle under the control of his Vampire Brides (Monica Bellucci, Michaela Bercu & Florina Kendrick) & travels himself to London where he meets Harker's fiancé Mina whom he believes is the reincarnation of his bride Elisabeta. Dracula drinks he blood of Mina's friend Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost) & her doctor Jack Seward (Richard E. Grant) calls in professor Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) who quickly realises that they are dealing with a Vampire & that they are in great danger...Co-produced & directed by Francis Ford Coppola this is maybe the greatest adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel ever committed to celluloid, in my opinion anyway. The script by James V. Hart probably sticks to original source material more closely than any other screen version of Dracula I've seen, apparently this is the first time the Texan character of Quincey Morris (Bill Campbell) appears in any screen version & the climactic chase through the Carpathian mountains where Van Helsing uses the psychic Mina to track Dracula. It also changes a few things as one would expect since film & literature are two very different mediums & to keep Dracula himself at the forefront of the story he makes Mina the reincarnation of his dead wife & turns the story into a sensuous romantic tale which works very well. I think all the character's are great, I liked then dialogue, I liked the story & the way it moves along & I liked the back-story given to Dracula although I have to say at over two hours in length it's a touch long even though I can't really think of anything I'd like to see less of.Director Coppola does a magnificent job here, I recently saw John Badham's 1979 Dracula & really liked that with it's immaculate & precise period production design which seems very historically accurate. An approach Coppola's Dracula ignores in favour of a wonderful Gothic comic book look & feel, it's very extravagant & wild as the filmmakers lets their imagination's run riot & as a result it's a joy to watch. A lot of time & effort went into the look of this film with fantastic production values, the sets, the costumes, the decor & the cinematography is all style & visual flair plus there's a great dark sexuality running through the film as well. I was impressed. There's not much in the way of gore, there are a few decapitations, a cool close up on a slashed throat & a bit of blood but little else.With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 Dracula is technically brilliant apart from some truly terrible model shots, it's got a tremendous style to it & it is very well made. The acting varies, Ryder lets the cast down with a timid & forgettable performance, Oldman makes for a decent Dracula, Reeves is miscast as Harker while Hopkins overacts somewhat as Van Helsing & Grant as Dr. Seward is somewhat underused.Dracula is probably the best version of the tale I've seen on the screen, I don't think there's anything I didn't like about it other than it was a bit long. It stays close to the original novel, it looks terrific, it has a good cast & it makes for good entertainment. Definitely recommended.",8,1,3,17 December 2006
Die Hard with a Vengeance," I love this film, maybe the most entertaining Die Hard of them all.
","Die Hard: With a Vengeance is set in New York City where cop Lieutenant John McClane (Bruce Willis) gets caught up in a deadly game of cat & mouse with mad terrorist bomber Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), holding the city & police department to ransom with the threat of large bombs going off in very public places John is forced to go along with whatever Simon says, also along for the ride is Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) who inadvertently helped McClane escape from one of Simon's traps & becomes part of his game. As McClane & Zues race around the city doing everything Simon says the police are busy searching schools for a huge bomb planted in one Simon's attention turns to the Federal Gold Reserve which has been left totally unguarded...Co-produced & directed by John McTiernan I will say straight away that Die Hard: With a Vengeance is my favourite Die Hard film, I will maybe accept that the original Die Hard (1988) is perhaps the slightly better film but as far as I'm concerned I think Die Hard: With a Vengeance is my overall favourite & I'd sooner sit down & watch this again than sit down & watch the original again. The script by Jonathan Hensleigh is the single most action packed film I've ever seen, from the opening couple of minutes which we gets some cool views of New York City which is suddenly & unexpectedly interrupted by a huge bomb going off to an action packed climax featuring an exploding helicopter & McClane uttering his iconic line 'yippie-kay-yay mother f-cker' Die Hard: With a Vengeance never, & I mean never lets up for a second. Beside being the most action packed film I've seen Die Hard: With a Vengeance wisely tries to do something different with the whole Die Hard scenario, after Die Hard 2 (1990) which was very similar to the original film Die Hard: With a Vengeance feels much fresher, the whole Christmas thing is absent, McClane's annoying wife is nowhere to be seen neither is that reporter Dick Thornberg & the film isn't tied down to a single location as the action takes place all over New York state. I also think it was a great move to give McClane a sidekick to work against, the fact Zeus is black & there's a certain racial tension between them is used to very funny effect & the whole mismatched partner thing has been done to death but rarely as good as it is here. I just love this film & I cannot think of one single bad thing to say about it, it moves like a rocket, there's enough action to fill a dozen lesser Hollywood blockbusters, it also has a nice edge to it as there's some funny dialogue & plenty of bad language as well as plenty of hard bloody violence which the latest in the series Live Free or Die Hard (2007) was sorely lacking.Director McTiernan is back on-board after directing the original Die Hard & he turns in a breathless roller-coaster ride of an action flick, has it ever been bettered in terms of pure adrenaline pumping action scenes? The only time it became really silly was when McClane & Zeus seemingly fall 100's of feet onto a metal cargo ship container which in reality would have broken every bone in their bodies but hey, it's just a film right? Almost every type of action sequence you can think of is here, car chases, shoot-outs, fights, huge explosions, jumping onto moving trains & boats, surfing on top of huge dumper trucks (!), train wrecks & a taxi ride through Central Park in a cool sequence amongst many cool sequences. The violence is pretty hard & bloody at times, from slashed throats to bad guy's having their heads shot off. The profanity is also very strong (as long as your not watching one of the awful censored UK versions) with the constant use of the 'F' word, it does lead to some very funny dialogue & exchanges between character's though!With a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 one has to say you can see all that on screen, in fact watching it again last night I would have thought it was a 100 plus million budgeted film. Considering past events I very much doubt a film about a mad terrorist setting off bombs in New York would get made today, luckily it was made in '96 so we weren't denied one of the greatest action films ever due to unfortunate events. Willis was paid a cool 15 million to reprise his role & he puts in a great performance, no-one can say a one-liner like him! Samuel L. Jackson is very funny as well & puts in another fine performance, I could just watch these two shout, swear & argue with each other all day!Die Hard: With a Vengeance is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest action film from the 90's & certainly one of the best ever made, it's literally none stop. I mean if you want action then this is the film for you, I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about it. To my eyes Die Hard: With a Vengeance is just about the perfect action film & it's as simple & straight forward as that.",9,1,3,4 January 2008
Con Air," 'I was going to get a hair cut.' No expense spared 90's blockbuster action flick.
","Con Air starts as US Ranger & wrongly convicted killer Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) boards a prisoner transport plane for a routine transfer back home to Alabama to be released on parole after several years in jail. Also on-board are some of the country's most dangerous inmates who are being transfered to a new state of the art prison in Alabama including Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich), Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames) & William 'Billy Bedlam' Bedford (Nick Chinlund) who through careful planning have set up an elaborate scheme to hijack the plane & make a break for freedom. The plan works to perfection & they gain control of the plane, however in the struggle Poe's best friends syringe is broken & he cannot inject himself with the insulin he needs to stay alive & Poe refuses to leave him. Not only does Poe decide to stay & help his friend he sets about grounding the plane & sending the likes of Cyrus back to jail where they belong...Directed by Simon West this mega budget no expense spared action flick produced by Jerry Bruckheimer is as good as huge overblown excessive Hollywood action flicks come. I should say at this point like many Hollywood films Con Air is available in both it's original theatrical cut & the obligatory 'Extended Unrated Director's Cut' just so the studio can milk more money out of the fans, I have never seen the extended version (these days I flat refuse to spend yet more money on what is essentially the same film) & will be basing my comments on the shorter theatrical cut. The script by Scott Rosenberg was apparently inspired by newspaper article about a plane that transports prisoners & from such humble meagre beginnings one of the most downright entertaining big budget action spectacles of the 90's arose. I admit it right now, I love this film & have seen it multiple times & enjoy it immensely on each occasion. The thing moves like an absolute rocket, sometimes it moves a little too fast & the numerous over-the-top action set-pieces come thick & fast. Would fans of the genre have it any other way? Sure there's plot holes & it's highly unlikely half the things featured in Con Air would be achievable in real life but this isn't real life is it? No, it's an unashamed, highly entertaining action flick & if you treat it as such you'll have an absolute blast watching it. I thought the character's were fun & distinctive, there are some great one-liners & it's a tight, simple yet effective story.Director West does a fine job, the explosions are huge, the stunts are suitably spectacular, there are car chases, plane chases, fights, shoot-outs & some nice satisfying violence too. It's all here. The action scenes are brisk & well choreographed with plenty of big bangs for the money. I loved the climax as well as the plane landing in Vegas & the subsequent motorbike/fire truck chase. There really isn't anything negative I can say about Con Air, I just thought it was a top film that does, what it sets out to do, perfectly.With a budget of around $75,000,000 (it took about $25,000,000 during it's opening weekend) you can definitely see a large chunk of that on screen with all the action & explosions. There's a great cast including Cage, Malkovich, Rhames, the creepy yet always funny Steve Buscemi, John Cusack & Colm Meaney. Everyone put in good over-the-top performances such as the material demands.Con Air is one of the quintessential action flicks of the 90's, it's absolutely great & has everything you could hope for including big bangs, flashy cars getting trashed, fights, shoot-outs, big name actors having fun & funny one-liners. Those looking for something deep or meaningful may want to give Con Air a miss but this is essential viewing for action film fans who wouldn't have it any other way.",8,3,4,15 October 2007
Hancock," A different kind of superhero film.
","Hancock is set in Los Angeles where John Hancock (Will Smith) lives as a powerful superhero fighting crime, he can fly & is invincible to all injury. However the residents of LOs Angeles dislike Hancock because of the vast amounts of damage he causes & lack of modesty, feeling alone, unwanted & unappreciated Hancock has slipped into alcoholism & depression. Hanacock saves public relations man Ray Emrey (Jason Bateman) from being hit by an oncoming train & as thanks Ray invites Hancock to his home for dinner, Hancock agrees & meets Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron). Ray suggests to Hancock that he needs an image makeover to make him more appealing to the public & when Hancock is branded a public menace & an arrest warrant is issued Ray feels it would be a perfect opportunity to turn Hancock's lowly image around by giving himself up in order for the authorities & public to realise how much they need him when he is not there...Directed by Peter Berg this romantic fantasy film is an alternative on the recent spate of superhero/comic book hero films that been released over the past few years, while a few of the ideas & set-pieces in Hancock are fun & as a whole it's a watchable film I wouldn't call it anything other than watchable. Available in both it's original theatrical version & an extended 'Unrated' cut that runs about nine minutes longer I will be basing my comments on this shorter theatrical version. The one thing about Hancock that puzzles is the uneven tone as it can't quite decide what it wants to be, does it want to be an all out slapstick comedy or a serious superhero film that deals with real issues or a tragic romance? Aspects of all three are here all mixed together in a very uncertain manner, the first half of Hancock is far more enjoyable than the second with Hancock a depressed hard drinking superhero who gets a rough ride from those he seeks to protect while the second half of the film introduces this huge twist that comes from nowhere. I didn't think the twist worked that well to be honest & it just gets sillier & sillier in this sort of fantasy romance that turns to tragedy that as expected gets a nice happy Hollywood ending anyway. While amusing at tims Hancock is never that funny with the gags & jokes feeling flat, while some of the action scenes are cool it never excites that much because of the silly tone & the romance between Hancock & his sibling has no emotional impact & feels like it's there to stretch the running time out a bit. The lack of any significant enemy or super-villain for Hancock doesn't help either & the film feels a bit empty as a result. No explanation is given for Hancock's origin & any serious issue the script tries to raise like prejudice & racism have little impact. At about 90 minutes long at least it's fairly short, the pace is good & Hancock certainly isn't boring but as I said, it just sort of passes the time rather than enthrals or really engages.As expected from such a big budget Hollywood blockbuster there are loads of CGI computer effects sequences here, from car chases to tornado's to people flying to general mayhem & destruction. The effects are good, you can see that they are just CGI effects but they look alright & obviously a lot of money was spent on them. Apparently conceived as a much darker film the tone was made much lighter for a family summer release which maybe explains the uneven mix of silliness & seriousness.With a supposed budget of about $150,000,000 this has to be one of the biggest budget films ever made, there are plenty of effects for sure & lots of visual trickery I suppose. The acting is alright but it's odd seeing Will Smith as a rude & rather ordinary person rather the quick fire one-line spouting charmer her usually is.Hancock is a decent enough film, sure the tone is uneven & I am unsure about the giant twist but it entertains & is quite fun in it's own absurd way. You could do a lot worse that's far sure, worth a watch if nothing else.",5,1,2,3 March 2011
Shooter," Watchable action thriller.
","Shooter starts as ex-counter intelligence sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is contacted by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) for an extra special patriotic assignment, US intelligence have gotten wind of a plan to assassinate the President by a sniper & Johnson wants to use Swagger's skills & expertise to locate the sniping point & stop the assassination. Swagger reluctantly agrees but is double crossed as the Presidential assassination was bluff to cover their real target the Archbishop of Ethiopia & Swagger is framed for the murder, barely escaping the scene with his life Swagger is hunted by the police, the FBI & those responsible for the assassination & has nowhere to go or turn to. Swagger must uncover the truth & put away the bad guy's before they get to him...Directed by Antoine Fuqua this fairy routine action thriller isn't too bad but isn't anything to write home about either, clocking at over two hours with a fairly exposition heavy plot that is surprisingly light on action Shooter is merely adequate at best. The plot is stand action thriller stuff, some one man army ex-military with a troubled past is forced out of retirement for one reason or another & basically takes on the bad guy's all by himself & predictably wins. Based on the novel by the Pulitizer Prize winning Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter this is a surprisingly slow moving action thriller that never really gets going, sure there is the odd fight & the initial action surrounding the assassination of the Archbishop & Swagger's escape is cool but the rest of it is quite low-key with only a couple of explosions & a few shoot-outs to show for it's two hour duration. The plot really isn't that clever or as cerebral as it thinks it is, we have had corrupt Senator's, evil US military Colonel's for hire & endless streams of bad guy's willing to line-up & get shot before many, many times & Shooter adds little to the mix. There are also problems with the plot, it's hard to believe that Swagger would fall for such a ridiculous plan & why does Swagger just take Johnson's word for it? Why not at least check him out or even ask what agency he works for? Considering he is the most wanted man in America with his face plastered all over the media Swagger manages to move around surprisingly freely, are we expected to believe that a gun used in an assassination isn't checked by the FBI at any point to make sure it even fires? The idea that the FBI wouldn't check maiden names for people connected with Swagger is hard to believe & quite why Swagger is let free at the end to kill the bad guy's is a mystery, didn't he still break lots of laws? At two hours long it does get a bit tedious & the lack of outright action becomes a problem, while not the worst action thriller out there Shooter felt like a direct to video mid budget flick. The character's are weak, no-one is given much screen time apart from Swagger & he's the most cold & emotionless person in the thing.Most of the action revolves around long distance sniping & that gives the action scenes a detached feel as Swagger is rarely on screen with his nemesis, there are a few fights & a few stabbings but there's not much action going on. A house explodes & a few pipe bombs go off as well as a minor car chase but it's surprisingly small scale & forgettable. The look & style of Shooter is quite nice with a steady camera & none of that machine-gun editing that is so irritating in modern action films.With a supposed budget of about $61,000,000 this is well made I suppose, filmed mainly in Canada. Keanu Reeves was the original choice to play the lead but Walhberg got the part & he is alright if a little one dimensional. Singer Eminem was offered a part as a villain but turned it down while Danny Glover has an annoying whispering type lisp for some reason.Shooter is a standard action thriller that doesn't have much action & doesn't work as a serious thriller because of all the implausibilities, a very cold & humourless film that I thought was watchable enough but nothing special & I doubt I would ever want to see it again.",5,2,3,23 May 2010
Scream," 'So, how does it feel to be almost brutally butchered?' A classic already.
","Scream starts with Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) receiving a phone call which she puts down to a wrong number, however the caller keeps ringing her back each time becoming increasingly hostile & threatening. It's not long before Casey finds out that her boyfriend Steven Orth (Kevin Patrick Walls) has been gutted & she is next... The news of the double murder quickly spreads through the small American town of Woodsboro as Sheriff Burke (Joseph Whipp) concentrates his investigations at the local high school questioning all the pupils, including Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) whose Mother was brutally raped & murdered a year earlier. Later that night as Sidney waits for her friend Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan) to pick her up she too receives a phone call from the ghost masked killer & is attacked but her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) conveniently shows up just in time. Reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) sense a big story & starts to hassle Sidney while Tatum's Brother Deputy 'Dewey' (David Arquette) takes it upon himself to look out for Sidney. As the mystery deepens with Sidney's Father going missing & Sidney unsure of who to trust Tatum's boyfriend Stuart Macher (Matthew Lillard) organises a party with lots of potential teenage victims for the serial killer...Directed by Wes Craven who also has a small cameo as the Freddy Krueger inspired janitor, Scream is the horror film that made the genre popular again, the film which so many have tried to copy since. A fine film it is too. The script by Kevin Williamson plays around with all the slasher film clichés in a witty self referential sort of way. Scream is bursting at the seams with all the horror film in-jokes & homages, most people could probably watch Scream two or three times & still not spot them all. Like the horror film lover character Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) who knows all the traditional slasher rules & plays them to the hilt like if your a virgin in a horror film you die. The dialogue also pokes fun at the genre in an affectionate way like when the killer mentions going outside by oneself to investigate a strange noise as being stupid! It's great fun for horror fans, like myself, to try & spot all the references & mentions other classic horrors get. I thought the mystery element was great, Scream has plenty of red herrings & I was never sure who the killer was right up until the final effective reveal which is quite clever although the motive behind the murders is somewhat shallow & hardly surprising. I thought Scream dragged a little from after Casey was murdered for the next 40 odd minutes as no one dies at all, this witty & hip dialogue is all well & good to entertain up to a point but I would have liked a little more action as well. Technically Scream is as good as one could hope for on a relatively small $15,000,000 budget, director Craven creates some good set pieces & effective sequences especially the opening, the cinematography is very good, the music incorporates horror themes into itself particularly Halloween (1978) & as a whole Scream has that Hollywood polish about it. The violence & gore is restrained, a few stabbings & shootings plus Steven's guts spilling out at the start is about it, a little disappointing actually. The young attractive cast do a good job, Campbell makes for a likable enough 'scream queen' for the 90's & Ulrich is great & has a cold emotionless look on occasion that coupled with is boyish good looks you are never quite sure if he's telling the truth or not, Arquette makes for a suitably goofy deputy & Cox is perfectly cast as the bitchy reporter, in reality after meeting each other on Scream Arquette & Cox later married. The sequel Sream 2 (1997) reunites all the surviving cast members & is also well worth watching if you enjoyed this. Overall Scream is a great horror film that has to some extent reinvented the genre & just about deserves it's already classic status although I have slight reservations about it's slow pace at times which is my only complaint with it as a whole. An absolute must for horror fans & definitely worth a watch for more general audiences too although some of the horror film humour may pass you by. Still, highly recommend!",8,4,11,3 September 2005
Halloween," The most overrated horror film ever...
","Halloween starts in th small town of 'Haddonfield, Illinois Halloween Night 1963' where a young 6 year old boy named Michael Myers (Will Sandin) brutally stabs his sister Judith (Sandy Johnson) to death... Jump forward to 'Smith's Grove, Illinois October 30 1978' where Michael myers has spent the last 25 years in a mental institution, until tonight as this is the night he escapes... Back at Haddonfield & everyone is preparing for Halloween including Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) who is planning to babysit for the night. However Michael travels back to Haddonfield where he stalks & murders various teenagers...Co-written, co-produced & directed by John Carpenter who also composed the music I personally think Halloween is quite simply the most overrated horror film I've ever seen. The script by Carpenter & producer Debra Hill really is as simple as any slasher out there, there isn't a plot to speak of to be honest. I thought just about everything in Halloween was average at best, the character's, the dialogue, the situations, the story & the kills. It's an OK film, there's nothing spectacularly wrong with it but I found it a bit of a chore to watch, nothing particularly exciting happens & to an extent I suppose it's become a victim of it's own success as there were so many imitators & copycat films that probably just about anyone will know where it's going & pretty much everything that's going to happen. I don't even think it's a particularly good slasher either, there are others that I enjoy far more than Halloween.Director Carpenter does a good job, there's a decent atmosphere & he likes to use the whole of the frame by having Michael pop-up in the background & then have him disappear. Halloween also features lots of long nice looking tracking shots rather than quick edits which I liked. A special mention goes the opening credits & the theme tune which are admittedly very cool. Forget about any gore as there isn't any, this ones all about the build-up rather than the pay-off.With a budget of about $325,000 Halloween is well made & quite a classy little film for the money. When released it became the highest grossing independent feature film ever although I fail to see why it's so highly regarded. The acting as OK, I can't say I remember anyone from it though.Halloween is an OK slasher for sure, but one of the greatest horror films ever? I'm not so sure about that. If people love it than great but for me it didn't quite do enough & it's entertainment value was almost none existent.",5,8,23,21 December 2006
Carrie," One of the best Stephen King adaptations around.
","Carrie starts in a girls locker room (which, in my opinion as a bloke, is a good place to start) where the girls are getting changed & Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is having a shower. As she soaps herself down she begins to bleed, she is having her first menstrual period but thinks she is bleeding to death as she knows nothing about what is happening to her because her strict fanatical religious mother Margaret (Piper Laurie) hasn't told her about the facts of life. The rest of the girls taunt & tease her, throwing tampons at her & laughing, the gym teacher Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) comes to Carrie's rescue. The Bates High School prom is fast approaching & the nasty mean Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) is barred from going, she blames Carrie & together with her boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta) plans to gain a cruel revenge. Meanwhile Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels sorry for Carrie & tells her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to ask Carrie to the prom, he agrees & Carrie accepts despite strong protests from her loony mum. At the prom things go well to start with but Carrie is humiliated in front of the entire school by Chris, in a rage of anger Carrie uses her powers of telekinesis, the ability to move or change objects through the power of the mind, to gain some sweet revenge of her own...Directed by Brian De Palma Carrie is a good horror film. The script by Lawrence D. Cohen is based on the 1974 novel by Stephen King which I have not read so I cannot compare them, in fact Carrie was King's very first novel & in turn became the first to be adapted into a film. Carrie is all about character's, feelings & it tries to say something meaningful, it's not an easy film to pigeonhole as it could be described as a horror, thriller, drama or fantasy with strong elements from all. Every emotion in the book is here, sadness, sorrow, pity, anger, hate, happiness, jealousy, fear & it even touches upon the taboo subject of child abuse. The film does a brilliant job at portraying these emotions so that you really care & feel for these people which makes what happens so much more meaningful. There is an 'Ugly Ducking' vibe to it as Carrie starts off shy, unhappy & suffers plenty of growing pains before she transforms into something different at the prom. Carrie is pretty slow going for the majority of it's 100 odd minute duration but this is essential as things build up superbly towards the climax where the horror really kicks in. I don't usually like slow character driven films but Carrie worked for me & I enjoyed it but don't expect a happy ending as Carrie is most definitely not a feel good film.Director De Palma does a first class job here, the character's are brilliantly drawn & developed. He gives the film some style with a few really cool memorable shots like the dizzying spinning camera scene when it revolves around Carrie & Tommy for what seems like ages, the split screen effect at the climax where we see Carrie's anger as she dishes out some revenge &, of course, that opening shower scene... Forget about any violence or gore as that's not what Carrie is all about, just a few stabbings.With a supposed budget of about $1,800,000 Carrie is well made throughout, good special effects, some nice stunts, good music & solid production values throughout. The acting is simply superb from everyone involved, Spacek is absolutely brilliant here & was rightly nominated for a best actress Oscar in '77 & Laurie was nominated for best supporting actress although neither won (I have no idea who did that year but they must have been good). A young John Travolta does well.Carrie is a classic piece of horror that has impact & is quite a powerful watch, it's well made & stands up well even today although the slightly slow pace & lack of gory action may put some off. I'm sure you can get this cheap on DVD these days & it probably turns up on TV all the time too so there's no excuse not have seen, or see sometime in the near future, Carrie. Definitely worth watching.",8,3,8,25 December 2005
The Woman in Black," Decent period set Hammer horror ghost story.
","The Woman in Black is set in Engand at the turn of the 20th Century & starts in London as junior lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is told to travel to a small coastal village called Crythin Grifford to settle the estate of the recently deceased Alice Brablow & sell Eel Marsh House where Alice lived until her death. Arriving there Kipps finds the local villagers very unwelcoming, managing to pay someone to take him to Eel Marsh House so he can do the paperwork Kipps spends a few hours there & notices strange figures that he realises are ghost's & in particular the haunting vision of the evil woman in black. Kipps investigates the history of Eel Marsh House & discovers a terrible past & that the sinister woman in black is a vengeful ghost who wants to take revenge for her own son's death by killing all the villagers children...This English, Canadian & Sweedish co-production was directed by James Watkins & is the fourth film from Hammer Studios since it's revival, having said that the new Hammer is just a brand as it uses a well known name merely to sell genre product picked up for release & produced by other's whereas the original Hammer of the 60's & 70's had a regular in-house team of producers & actor's & made their own films. The Woman in Black is based on a novel by Susan Hill originally published in 1983 which was turned into a stage play & made into the television film The Woman in Black (1989) which I have not seen so cannot compare the two. The script here was written by Jane Goldman (the wife of Jonathan Ross) & feels a little bit empty at times, the long stretches where Kipps stays in Eel Marsh House & the way it sort of fizzles out at the end with a surreal climax & no great reason behind anything like why bother find the boy's body & putting it in the coffin? It doesn't do anything. The local villagers are forgotten about halfway through, the line at the end 'your not my mother' also confuses things further. Lasting about 90 minutes it moves along at a fair pace although it does try to develop the story & build the atmosphere even if it doesn't quite work at times.One thing that The Woman in Black as going for it is some wonderful production design, The Woman in Black looks fabulous with the Victorian period setting & the creepy old house sat on an isolated island. A lot of time & effort obviously went into the visual style of this, the CGI computer effects are also used sparingly & are pretty good. There's no real gore here, a young girl coughs up some blood & a couple of decomposing skeletons are seen but otherwise The Woman in Black tries to create a sense of dread rather than assault the senses with CGI & special effects. One aspect that may annoy some people are the constant fake scares, scenes where you know something is going to happen only for some mundane occurrence to make a loud noise like a tap suddenly spurting dirty water or something suddenly appearing like a screeching bird. I loved the opening scene which is quite eerie as three young girls suddenly get up jump out of their window's together.With a supposed budget of about $17,000,000 this did very well at the box-office over becoming one of the most successful horror films released in British cinemas, this was more successful than any of Hammer's original films that screened during the 60's the 70's in fact. Cotterstock Hall in Northamptonshire stood in for Eels Marsh House & it does a fine job. The acting is solid from a good cast, Radcliffe looks a bit young to be a father here but that's nit picking I suppose.The Woman in Black is a solid supernatural horror thriller that tries to build up tension & suspense through it's story rather than gore & CGI which is admirable enough I suppose, while it drags a bit & maybe the story isn't quite as deep or as satisfying as it could have been The Woman in Black is an old fashioned haunted house horror film with modern production values. I liked it.",5,0,0,22 March 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Great serial killer horror film, it didn't win all those Oscars for nothing did it?
","The Silence of the Lambs begins with FBI agent in training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) being summoned to Jack Crawford's (Scott Glenn) office who happens to be the FBI's director of behavioural science. Clarice is told by Crawford that he wants her to travel to the Baltimore state hospital & interview the notorious serial killer Dr. Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to possibly help identify a current serial killer nick-named 'Buffalo Bill' (Ted Levine) who has kidnapped, murdered & skinned several young girls. Clarice meets up with the slimy Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald) who runs the hospital & has responsibility for Lecter, he tells her some basic rules & then she's ready. Clarice's meeting with Lecter goes O.K. & he gives her a few cryptic clues which leads her to a severed head in a jar, 'Buffalo Bills' first victim. Meanwhile 'Buffalo Bill' himself has abducted a young girl named Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith) who is the daughter of a powerful Washington Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker). Lecter sees an opportunity to leave his miserable existence in his cramped brick cell behind & tries to strike a deal with the Senator in exchange for 'Buffalo Bills' name. As politics & greed begin to surface Lecter sets his plans in motion while Clarice who is now on the investigating team is determined to track 'Buffalo Bill' down, save Catherine before he kills her & put a stop to his grisly crimes for good.Directed by Jonathan Demme (who also has a small cameo at the end apparently) I thought Silence of the Lambs was a solid horror film, & by the way if you listen to the documentary on the DVD everyone involved in the production refers to it as a horror film & nothing else! The script by Ted Tally based on the novel by Thomas Harris is a little slow & deliberate on occasion but for the most part it's very interesting & gripping. There isn't much in the way of on-screen blood or gore, in fact very little, but it's still quite a powerful film with Anthony Hopkins performance as Hannibal Lecter the obvious standout, although having said that he has very little on-screen time with about 15 or so minutes in total which is the shortest amount of time ever to win a best actor Oscar. I liked how Silence of the Lambs ended & in particular how things turned out for Lecter. Everyone else is good as well but I personally didn't really like Jodie Foster that much as she just got on my nerves after a while & I couldn't see her as a tough chick kind of character! Horror film directors (another indication that Silence of the Lambs was indeed intended to be a horror film before it became a big success & we all know horror films can't be successful so now it's called a thriller) Roger Corman & George A. Romero both have cameos. Technically Silence of the Lambs is competent but not outstanding, the music is O.K., the photography a little flat & the production design bland but with such a strong story I guess these things don't matter so much. There are some truly great moments throughout, too. Overall I liked it for sure but I did find it a little slow going during certain places & Jodie Foster just didn't do it for me as Agent Starling for some reason I can't quite explain, Silence of the Lambs is a great horror film but I couldn't see myself sitting through it again anytime soon & it's maybe not quite as good as all those Oscars would suggest you to believe. Definitely worth watching & deserving of my 8 out of 10 star rating but I do have certain reservations about it & believe it to be a little overrated.",8,0,8,9 April 2005
Signs," I actually really rather like Signs...
","Signs is set in Bucks County, Pennsylvania where Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) lives on a farm with his his two young children Bo (Abigail Breslin) & Morgan (Rory Culkin) plus his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), one morning they discover elaborate crop circles in their corn fields. At first they think it's a hoax but there are newsflashes all over the TV which say these crop circles have appeared all over the world, then things turn really sinister when UFO's start appearing in the sky by these crop circles & when footage of an alien is caught on a camcorder the Hess family have to consider the possibility of an alien invasion...Written, produced & directed by M. Night Shyamalan who also has a fairly big role in the film as Ray Reddy who ran over Mel Gibson's character's wife I actually really liked Signs. The script which takes itself pretty seriously could be described as somewhat slow at times but I thought the story was engaging & pretty intriguing which kept me hooked. I really liked all the character's here, OK maybe the kids are a touch annoying as they tend to be in films but I thought this was pretty well written with a decent balance between humour & seriousness. The alien invasion stuff is kept to a minimum & little is seen of the aliens themselves, this is a film where less is more & it retains a air of creepiness around the aliens. It's not big on action either & concentrates on the Hess family & almost totally ignores the outside world which is unusual for recent alien flicks which tend to be nothing more than showcase's for overblown CGI computer effects as in Independence Day (1996) & War of the Worlds (2005) so Signs is a nice change of pace, I mean there's nothing wrong with huge CGI special effects filled films but Signs was just a nice change.Director Shyamalan does a fine job but then he had a mega budget to help him, for those looking for another The Sixth Sense (1999) will probably be disappointed as Signs is a very different film & doesn't have such a great ending. I thought there were some creepy moments here & the restraint in the usage of CGI here helps create an ominous atmosphere & leaves something to the audiences imagination which is a novelty these days. What CGI is here is very good & the alien when eventually seen looks OK if a little unimaginative.With a whopping budget of $72,000,000 Signs obviously looks the business & has that big budget Hollywood look although that huge figure did surprise me a bit as there's not many special effects, there's only about five character's in the entire film & it takes place in the same location for the most part so 72 big ones does seem like quite a lot considering the end result. I thought the acting was pretty good throughout.Signs in my opinion is a great alien invasion flick that tells it's story in a different sort of way, I liked it a lot although I know for a fact there's a lot of hate out there for it. Personally I think it's well worth a watch.",7,57,79,27 May 2007
Identity," Average murder mystery, I guessed two thirds of the ending...
","Identity is set in Nevada late one night during a fierce rainstorm & starts as limo driver Edward Dakota (John Cusack) is driving actress Paris Nevada (Amada Peet) across a remote desert valley, suddenly he runs into a woman named Alice York (Leila Kenzle) who was standing in the highway after her car got a flat tyre. Together with her husband George (John C. McGinley) & young son Timmy (Bret Loehr) they stop at an isolated motel to get some help, there they quickly realise all the roads are flooded & the telephone lines are down & that they will have to wait it out until the morning. Various other assorted people turn up from police officer's to a couple who were recently married, soon after the decapitated head of Paris is found & it becomes clear there is a murderer amongst their number as the dead bodies start to pile up at an alarming rate...Directed by James Mangold Identity is for the first seventy odd minutes an Agatha Christie style whodunit as various character's are killed off under mysterious circumstances in some sort of isolated location, it has the intrigue, the mystery, the red herrings & story traits one expects from a typical whodunit. I love murder mystery whodunit's, I really do from the likes of classic telly detective show's like Quincy (1977 - 1983) to Columbo (1971 - 2000) to Midsomer Murders & straight out-and-out horror film whodunit's like Scream (1996) & I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) as well as dozens of imitator's, I have spent many an hour in front of my telly trying to work out who did it, why they did it & how they did it. I don't usually get it right but I usually do have fun trying to figure it out. Anyway, here we have Identity, which is a mixture of horror & straight laced detective drama which when all said & done like any good whodunit stands or falls by the strength of it's twist ending which I personally don't think is that good. It starts off fine, an isolated location, a torrential thunderstorm which strands several people all of whom seem to be hiding things or have hidden agenda's, then the killings begin & it draws you in as you just instinctively want to know who is responsible. So far so good. But then about twenty minutes before it's end Identity turns it's whole story, it's whole plot, all the character's & literally everything that has happened to that point on it's head with a frustrating twist which I didn't like. I understood it but I just didn't like it. In my opinion this twist cheapens everything that has happened before, it ruins the story & makes it almost pointless. Also I have to say that I guessed who the killer was, I was sat there watching Identity & thought who would the makers feel was the least likely person to have done it & went for them & I was totally right! Not why 'they' actually did it or how 'they' did it but I guessed their identity within twenty minutes. I also anticipated the plot twist involving another character exactly which didn't help matters since apart from one huge twist I pretty much had Identity figured out. Also, was the body of the dead motel owner ever explained? The eventual killer couldn't have possibly killed him...Director Mangold does alright, there's a decent atmosphere, there's some tension & one or two jump out of your seat scare moments as well. It's just a shame about the twist which I honestly didn't think worked, it made sense & I have no complaints there but I was just expecting more & the murder mystery side of things was too predictable for me although I'm not saying for one moment everyone who watches it will figure it out because I'm sure lots won't. There's a decapitated head in a tumble dryer but otherwise not much gore & the murders happen off screen.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 which sounds a hell of a lot of money to me, I thought it was one of those low budget films which relied on some sort of extreme plot twist to gain attention but 30 big ones puts this up there as a pretty big budget Hollywood flick. There's good cast here including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Alfred Molina, Jake Busey & Rebecca De Mornay who all put in good performances.Identity is a good murder mystery for seventy odd minutes but then sort of collapses in a really hard to swallow twist ending which for me ruined everything that had happened before it. The killer is too obvious as well. Good & an interesting film to watch once but I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again & I certainly couldn't recommend it.",5,2,8,10 January 2008
Speed," Enjoyable 90's action flick.
","Speed is set in Los Angeles where disgruntled & bitter ex-bomb squad psycho Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) holds an elevator full of people to ransom, either he gets three million dollars or he blows the emergency brakes but his plan is thwarted almost single handedly by LAPD cop officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves). Afterwards Payne feels even more bitter & angry so decides to play a deadly game with Jack, he tells Jack that he has placed a bomb on an LA bus & when the bus goes over 50mph the bomb will arm & if the bus falls below 50mph it will explode killing everyone on board. Jack risks his life to board the speeding bus to warn the driver & passengers, unfortunately the bus has already reached over 50mph, a way to disarm the bomb must be found or pay Payne his three point seven million dollar ransom...Directed by Jan de Bont this is a highly enjoyable fast paced action thriller from the 90's the likes of which they don't seem to make anymore. The script by Graham Yost was apparently rewrote by script doctor Joss Whedon who went uncredited & is an action packed adventure film that is very entertaining although is rather silly at times. The idea behind the film is great, I mean we all love a good car chase & Speed's plot basically gives us an entire film based around vehicular mayhem which is no bad thing. The thing moves along like a rocket, at over 110 minutes in length it certainly doesn't feel that long & it's hard not to like a film which is so single minded in trying to provide plenty of action, thrills & excitement for it's audience. I liked it & I think most people will like it, I certainly think most 90's action film junkies will love it. The character's are just about given enough development to bring them to life although I'd have liked a bit more motivation & explanation behind Payne's actions as it's said he was pensioned off & that's his whole reason for the bombings. Sure some of it was pretty silly & very far fetched but what the hell when a films this downright fun & entertaining who really cares?Director de Bont does alright, he certainly keeps the pace going & there are numerous memorable set-piece action scenes from the speeding bus dodging it's way through the LA traffic to a fight on top of a speeding train to exploding planes to a taught hostage situation at the start. I do have to say that while it's well made there's not much style & the opening credit sequence is maybe the most repetitive & boring I've ever seen in a big budget Hollywood film. There are some continuity issues here, the amount of times the bus hits something head on (smashing that cars door off, hitting the other car up the tow truck ramp & hitting other various sign posts & parked cars) without sustaining any visible damage is stretching things a bit, I mean there isn't even a scratch on it for the first half. It's also nice to watch a film where the majority of the stunts & action was filmed live rather than created using CGI computer effects like most films these days do. The actual violence levels are low & the body count kept to an absolute minimum which is a surprise.With a supposed budget of about $28,000,000 Speed didn't have as big a budget as I had originally thought, maybe they were allowed to film on that unopened freeway for free? Apparently Speed ran out of money during it's production & the subway sequence at the end hadn't been filmed but after good preview screenings (with the subway scene present as storyboards) the studio stumped up the cash to finish it. The acting is alright from a decent cast, Keanu Reeves is OK but doesn't have much presence & Sandra Bullock in her breakthrough role fares much better & comes across as more likable, Dennis Hopper is good as the villain but then he's a great actor anyway so it's expected.Speed is one one of those great macho big budget action thrillers from the 90's with huge amounts of mindless carnage & mayhem that are so enjoyable, it's a bit more silly than usual as well especially the ridiculous jump across an incomplete freeway which is as far fetched as they come. Followed by Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997) which has seemingly killed the franchise.",7,3,4,26 December 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Good but not brilliant.
","Live Free or Die Hard, known as Die Hard 4.0 elsewhere around the world, starts as New York detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) is ordered to pick up a computer hacker geek named Matt Ferrell (Justin Long) as a favour to the FBI who are investigating a strange computer hack at Washington. However it appears the FBI aren't the only ones interested in Ferrell as when McClane gets to his apartment several heavily armed men try to kill him, McClane saves Ferrell but finds himself in the middle of a plot to throw the entire United States into chaos by hacking into & disabling everything major system like paralysing the public transportation system, all forms of communication, gas, electricity, the internet etc. A disgruntled ex FBI nut called Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) & his men intend to use the chaos as a cover for one of the biggest robbery's ever, that is unless McClane can stop them...Directed by Len Wiseman this is the fourth entry in the popular Die Hard series of action films & is good but not brilliant & if I'm honest I was a little disappointed with it overall. The script by Mark Bomback was apparently based on an 'artlicle' called A Farewell to Arms by John Carlin & I've heard of films being based on novels but a newspaper/magazine article? Although when it comes down to it the plot is basically the same as the original Die Hard (1988) as a group of thieves use the cover of terrorism to steal lots of money. Anyway, I liked Live Free or Die Hard for what it was as it moves along like a rocket which is good since it lasts for over two hours & it prevents boredom setting in, it's nice to see John McClane back in action & speaking of action there's some truly fantastic set-pieces & stunts. However I also didn't like Live Free or Die Hard for what it wasn't, it didn't feel like a Die Hard film with the obvious toning down of the profanity & violence, I mean the villains in this don't seem to put up any resistance to McClane & he simply ends up shooting them, there's no big fights with bone crunching sound effects at all & the violence is very tame to none existent (although it'll come as no surprise if a longer more graphic version is released on DVD). Then there's the main villain Thomas Gabriel who has to be one of the most bland & dull bad guys ever, he's just some young guy casually dressed who only gets to shoot one person in the leg & that's it, he's just not evil enough & who on Earth decided to kill off Mai (Maggie Q) so early into the film? She was easily the best villain & she was a babe as well, at least she could actually fight. I don't know, I liked it but at the same time I was disappointed.Director Wiseman does OK here & he keeps the action moving along, unfortunately by dragging the Die Hard series kicking & screaming into the new millennium (the last film in the series Die Hard: With A Vengeance (1995) was made over a decade ago) the focus of the storyline is all about modern hi-tech computers, cell phones, the internet, hacking, defence systems & it has the feel of distancing McClane from the action, since a lot of what happens takes place in cyberspace there's nothing physical there if you know what I mean & the film tries to make the point that we rely on such technology too much. McClane & Gabriel never meet until the very end either which also has the unwanted effect of distancing them, sure they talk over the phone but it's not the same as an intense face-to-face meeting is it? The action set-pieces are at times spectacular with cars launched into flying helicopters, chases, shoot-outs, huge explosions & my favourite sequence when McClane is driving a large semi truck under & over some elevated freeways being fired upon by a fighter jet. Most of it is very over-the-top & not based in reality as McClane can seemingly jump from a jet onto a concrete freeway & survive with no major injuries.With a supposed budget of about $110,000,000 there's plenty of action on screen for the money but that really does sound like a lot doesn't it? It extremely well made with high production values & great stunt/effects work. The acting is alright but this isn't classic foul mouthed wise cracking Willis, why oh why did Fox cut this down?Live Free or Die Hard as a stand alone action film is a pretty darn fine one but as the fourth entry in possibly the greatest action series ever it comes across as a bit of a disappointment, as I said I thought it was good & I liked it but I didn't love it as there's a lot of room for improvement.",7,2,4,4 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," Didn't do much for me at all.
","X2 starts as an attempt is made on the US President's (Cotter Smith) life in the Oval office by a teleporting mutant called Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), the President sees this as an act of aggression on the part of all mutants & orders Willaim Stryker (Bran Cox) a military General to tighten up on mutant security. However it is in fact Stryker who was responsible for the attack & with the President's authority as well as some forged documents he sets out on his own personal crusade to rid the entire world of mutants, Stryker learns from Magneto (Ian McKellen) that Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) runs a school for mutants & the existence of the Cerebro machine in which Xavier can telepathically communicate with any living creature on the planet. Stryker intends to force Xavier to make contact with every mutant on Earth & telepathically kill them all...Directed by Bryan Singer who also has a small cameo in the film as one of the security men in Magneto's plastic prison this was the sequel to the original X-Men (2000) film the huge financial success of which pretty much got the whole Marvel superhero comic book adaptation thing going with such large box-office returns, the likes of Spider-Man (2002), Daredevil (2003), Hulk (2003), Elektra (2005), Fantastic Four (2005), Ghosr Rider (2007), the Blade trilogy & Iron Man (2008) duly followed to cash in on the cinema going publics craze for these superhero flicks. To be brutally honest I've never really been that impressed with the genre with the notable exceptions being the excellent Blade films & the fun Spider-Man flicks & the silly titled X2 (why not X-Men 2?) does nothing to change my overall opinion. I think one factor is these larger than life superhero character's with all manner of odd abilities were designed for a 2-D comic book rather than a 3-D film & with a few expectations they look better as a comic strip than a live action character, the basic mechanics & demands of a full length feature film are just very different than a simple comic strip. The script by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris & David Hayter is really weak, the character's are poor & lets not forget that not everyone will have read the comics or seen the original film, the story is also very poor. It feels very slow & pedestrian, most of it takes place between mutants in imaginary settings & therefore I found it very hard to think of the film taking place in reality. I know it's pure sci-fi but for it to work it needs to be grounded in some sort of recognisable reality otherwise where's the threat coming from? Also the X-Men themselves are too powerful, between them they can do just about anything including Wolverine who can get shot on the head yet heal himself. You just always felt they would be able to overcome any situation they find themselves in & it just kills any excitement or tension. At well over two hours X2 feels like it goes on forever, there aren't that many memorable set-pieces & as a whole I think X2 is one of the poorer Marvel superhero comic book films.Director Singer does alright but there's not much here that really stands out, there are a few forgettable fights, some exploding cop cars, a bust dam spewing water & a few flashy CGI computer effects. In fact I was quite surprised at how bland & routine feeling the action scenes were considering the budget. I also didn't like the way this was filmed, the scene at the end when Xavier & the rest of the X-Men turn up in the President's office with lightening flashing outside is truly embarrassing. I suspect that it was meant to be sinister & atmospheric but I just thought it looked awful & over dramatic. The special effects are generally very good but like most CGI computer effects you just 'know' what your watching is an effect.With a supposed budget of about $110,000,000 one has to say X2 is well made with high production values & that big budget Hollywood look & feel to it. I personally thought the acting was awful, the scenes at the end as they mourn Jean Grey are embarrassing, the shots around the camp fire as Magneto fills the rest of the X-Men in on Stryker's plans & they all try to look worried & concerned is another cringe worthy moment as is Rouge's 'scared' reaction when she lands the jet plane at the end. Hugh Jackman can't act, Halle Berry can't act (how did she ever win an Oscar?) although she does look good in tight leather & even great actors like Ian McKellen & Patrick Stewart seem off colour.X2 was a big disappointment to me, I was expecting lots of action & great effects but what I ended up with was a passable superhero comic book adaptation & nothing more. The story is very weak, the character's are weak & the action is forgettable. Followed by X-Men: The Last Stand (2006).",4,5,10,25 January 2008
The Sixth Sense," A fine horror film.
","The Sixth Sense is set in Piladelphia where child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) & his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) are enjoying a quiet evening in when one of Malcolm's former patients Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks into his house & shoots him... Jump forward to 'The Next Fall' & Malcolm has a new patient, a young troubled boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who is withdrawn, isolated & seems unhappy. As Malcolm befriends Cole & earns his trust Cole confesses a shocking secret that may well have a great impact on Malcolm himself...Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan The Sixth Sense was a huge hit back in '99 with 6 Oscar nominations & it became only the fourth horror film to be nominated for best picture, as a film it is as good as ever. The script is somewhat slow & deliberately paced, The Sixth Sense relies on quality storytelling & strong character's for it's impact & entertainment value rather than the recent trend of Hollywood horror films that want to incorporate as many fancy expensive computer graphics as they can. The much talked about & often spoiled twist ending is highly effective especially if you are unaware of it. The character's are well developed & you actually care for them which makes the film what it is, the dialogue is good & I can't remember a single swear word in it. The Sixth Sense is a fantastic modern day ghost story that hits all the right notes & may even bring a tear to a few people's eyes. The only negative is that I don't like long films which The Sixth Sense feels like, that's not a specific problem I suppose as it's a personal preference that I just don't like long films as I lose interest very quickly & that's just the way I am so if your looking for explosions, fights & car chases every five minutes you'd best give this one a miss. When all said & done for what it is it's still a great film though.Director Shyamalan does a functional job, there's no flashy camera-work here but again this is a film which relies on good storytelling & character's that is set in the real world. Keeping things very low key works well. There's a good atmosphere & some pretty creepy scenes.With a supposed budget of $55,000,000 I don't quite know where the money went & The Sixth Sense doesn't look like it cost 55 big ones. It's flawlessly made & has great production values. The acting is fantastic & everyone puts in a heartfelt performance.The Sixth Sense is a great horror film, there's the odd scare, some great performances, an absorbing & engaging story together with a classic twist ending. Well worth a watch, definitely recommended.",7,6,7,27 September 2006
Final Destination," Great teen horror flick with a nice hint of originality.
","Final Destination starts as 17 year old Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) & his classmates turn up at JFK airport in readiness to catch flight 180 to Paris, he boards the plane & it takes off & in midair it explodes killing everyone on-board. Alex them wakes up & realises it was a dream like vision, he becomes freaked out when the events which happened in his vision happen in real life & after causing a large commotion he along with several of his classmates are thrown off the plane before it takes off. They are left in the departure lounge as the plane takes off, then they all witness it as it blows up in mid air killing everyone aboard just like in Alex's vision. Those who walked off the plane try to get on with their lives but start to die under mysterious circumstances leading Alex to believe that death has come back to claim those he saved...Co-written & directed by James Wong I have to say I thought Final Destination when it originally came out was a breath of fresh air for the horror genre which was producing boring unimaginative teen crap for years like they were coming off on a production line, at the time I originally saw it at the cinema I genuinely thought Final Destination tried to be something that bit different yet still gave horror fans what they wanted. The script by Wong, producer Glen Morgan & Jeffrey Reddick was apparently based on a potential The X-Files (1993 - 2002) episode & I must admit I loved the idea behind it, I thought it was clever, fun & made a great central premise for killing off teens in spectacular ways. The character's are good considering their clichÃ©d American teen origins, the dialogue is good with it's plot explained just about enough to make sense without going overboard & at less than 100 minutes it moves along like a rocket with some extremely satisfying & clever set-pieces. The film also has a healthy respect for the genre & there are lots of homages & references to other genre films including naming the cast after old horror stars & director's, Valerie Lewton anyone? Of course it's not perfect & I'm not trying to say it is, while they are OK the character's are just faceless teens when all said & done, the mortician character is just very out-of-place, one could say it's a touch silly & the set-pieces go from sinister & clever acts which conspire to dispense of a character to overblown full on ghostly events like possessed electric cables, exploding cars & entire house's blowing up & some of it's own rules are broken as if Alex wasn't the next victim because he never actually changed seats why did death try to kill him when he was at the cabin before Carter who was as it is revealed the next victim? Still, I'll leave the nit picking to the monkeys because I just thought it was a highly entertaining & pretty original teen horror flick with a good story & decent gore.Director Wong does a good job & the film is very stylish & great to look at although I'm coming off the back of a terrible run of zero budget shot on a digital camcorder crap that makes something that looks this good an absolute god send. There's a lot of visual gags here, I loved the prevailing sense of doom at the airport with the informations boards displaying words like 'departed' & 'terminal'! Plus there's a John Denver song playing in the airport toilets &, of course, he died in a plane crash! I was more than pleased to see the makers haven't skipped on the gore either, there's decapitations, hangings, embalming's, stabbings, broken glass in necks, someone gets splattered by a bus in a great scene & there's plenty of blood splashed around. The film has a nice eerie tension & has a few genuine jumpy scare moments.With a supposed budget of about $23,000,000 this is very well made, the CGI effects are decent although not perfect while the make-up effects are very good. The film is set in a south New York but was shot in British Columbia in Canada. The acting is pretty good from a recognisable & good looking teenage cast, horror regular Tony Todd makes a small & somewhat pointless cameo.Final Destination is, in my humble opinion, one of the finest teen horror popcorn flicks this millennium & it's as simple & straight forward as that. This proved enough of a success to spawn two sequels, the even better Final Destination 2 (2003) & Final Destination 3 (2006).",8,5,8,15 September 2007
300," Stylish comic book film.
","300 is set in Greece during 480 B.C. where a Persian messenger arrives at the Kingdom of Sparta where King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) is told to submit & surrender to the self proclaimed God King of Persia named Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) who wants to rule the entire world, Leonidas refuses & kills the messenger which is considered an act of war by Xerxes. King Leonidas seeks help from the diseased Oracle's the Ephor's who refuse the going to war against Xerxes & his Persian army. Leonidas selects 300 of his best fighting Spartans to fight Xerxes & his army of one million soldiers, Leonidas sets up position in a narrow pass named The Hot Gates where Leonidas hops the great number of Xerxes army will count for nothing. Wave after wave of Persion onslaught only makes Leonidas & his men more determined & thousands of Persians are slaughtered...Co-written & directed by Zack Snyder this fantasy film was based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller & his then wife Lynn Varley first published back in 1998, 300 is actually based on the real historical event of the Battle of Thermopylae although there's little historic accuracy here & I would call 300 more of a fictional fantasy epic such as The Lord of the Rings rather than an historically accurate piece like Gladiator (2000). As a purely fantastical action adventure then 300 is fine entertainment in it's own right, it hits all the right notes if your looking for a lads film from muscular heroes to sword fights to standing up to overwhelming odds to lots of bloody battles & monsters & special effects with a fairly simple plot to tie everything together. Again the politics of the time is presented all wrong, it's accepted that Persian society was more free than the Greek equivalent & of course everyone speaks in English & go bare chested rather than wear armour but as I said just think of 300 as pure fantasy & you will be OK. At just under two hours the pace is good, there's plenty of battle scenes & some very striking imagery, the plot is alright & the basic theme of self sacrifice runs through the film although I must admit I didn't really care for any of the character's when certain ones died I felt nothing. The dialogue is simple yet effective with large portions of the story narrated which cuts down on exposition I suppose, I would say that 300 is a film you will remember for the fights & it's visual style rather than it's strong character's & plot though.Almost every shot of 300 was filmed against a blue or green screen & things like backgrounds, lighting, effects & other actor's were digitally created later, the only actually shot not filmed this was was when the Persian messenger rides over the hill but even then the shot was dramatically altered. All the colour levels have been significantly altered & while it looks stylish some of the time I found it looked a bit drab & boring at other's, there's plenty of nice visuals on show from flowing capes to exotic dances to huge armoured Elephants to a wall of human bodies to form a barricade to the Sun being blocked out by thousands of arrows shot into the air & it's a shame the colour scheme is unappealing. The fighting style is basically what looks cool on film rather than being historically accurate, the battles are cool & there's plenty of them from slow-motion to long sweeping shots that follow Leonidas & thankfully there's no machine gun editing or shaky camcorder crap going on. The gore is restrained, there's various blood spurts, a couple of cool slow motion decapitation's & a few severed limbs but I expected a little more I have to be honest.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 it looks it with plenty of action & effects. Filmed at the Icestorm Studios in Québec, Canada. The acting is solid although there's no household names apart from Gerard Butler.300 is really just a lads film with big blokes fighting each other in hand to hand combat, there's action, monsters & a decent enough story to hang it all on. I liked it & would watch it again & recommend it but I didn't like the bleached look at all & don't go into 300 expecting any historical accuracy as you won't find any.",7,6,10,8 July 2010
Cube," Brilliant, absorbing & ingenious horror thriller.
","Cube starts with a man named Alderson (Julian Richings) waking up in a square 14'x14' room with strangely decorated panels on the walls from which a white light shines through, he notices six hatches one on each wall, the ceiling & floor. Alderson opens one & enters the joining room which is exactly the same as the one he came from except a different colour light is shining through the translucent panels, inside he sets off a bobby trap that slices him into little pieces using razor wire... Six complete stranger's find themselves placed in similar cubes, a young maths student named Joan Leaven (Nicole de Boer), an architect David Worth (David Hewlett), a cop named Quentin (Mauruce Dean Wint), a doctor named Helen Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), an autistic boy Kazan (Andrew Miller) & an escaped convict Rennes (Wayne Robson). Each cube leads into another, some of which contain deadly traps while other's are perfectly safe, they have no food or water, no equipment & have no knowledge of the cube itself or why they are there. The six must try to work together & discover the secret of the cube & find a way out or die trying...This Canadian production was co-written & directed by Vincenzo Natali & is a simple yet superb film, I loved it. The script by Natali, Andre Bijelic & Graeme Manson is just so brilliant in it's simplicity. Who would have thought a film set almost entirely in various cube rooms that look exactly the same could be so gripping, engaging & so entertaining. The idea is just ingenious & Cube is really original & unique which is a hard trait to come by these days in films. The character's their emotions & personal struggles are very well written & developed & we really get to know each of them without long boring dialogue scenes. The film works wonderfully well & I was as puzzled as the character's on screen as they try to find a way out & I liked the idea that each one had a certain ability that needed to be found & utilised. Nothing in Cube is explained to any real degree of satisfaction which may annoy some people but I found the unanswered questions & mystery surrounding the cube added another layer to an already great film. On the negative side it can get a bit samey being set in exactly the same room for 90 odd minutes, I can't see many repeat viewings & the ending was maybe a bit too downbeat.Director Natali can't really do much to spruce things up since Cube is set in a single location although flashy camera work & CGI effect's isn't what Cube is about. He does manage to create terrific tension & atmosphere, I almost felt like I was there with them at times! There isn't much gore, someone is sliced into cubes & falls apart, someone has their face burned off with acid & there are a couple of stabbings.With a low budget Cube was shot entirely in one single 14'x14' room in which the lighting was changed to signify the different rooms. Technically Cube is fine with decent special effects & production values but the very nature of the film doesn't give much scope for variety. The acting is very strong by all involved & did you notice the relevance of the character's last names? They are all named after real prisons, Quentin is named after San Quentin in California, Holloway is a prison in England, Kazan in Russia, Rennes in France, Alderson in West Virginia while Leaven & Worth are obviously both taken from Leavenworth in Kansas. So now you know.I think Cube is a fantastic film that everyone should watch at least once, it's very clever, original, mysterious & totally gripping. I absolutely loved it. Followed by a sequel Cube 2: Hypercube (2002) & a prequel Cube Zero (2004) but I doubt either of them are as good.",9,1,2,27 December 2005
Fantastic Four," Not too bad at all.
","Fantastic Four starts as genetic scientists Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) & Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) ask's billionaire industrialist & friend Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon) to fund a trip into outer space to study a cosmic storm at his space-station. Doom agrees & goes along with Reed's ex-girlfriend Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) & her cocky pilot brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) to help out, while aboard the space-station all five are exposed to the cosmic storm. Back on Earth & they all experience changes, Reed can stretch his limbs, Ben turns into a rock creature, Sue gains the power of invisibility & Johnny can turn himself into a human flying fireball. After saving people in a huge pile up on a bridge the media dub them the Fantastic Four, meanwhile von Doom also undergoes changes as he slowly starts to turn into metal & has the ability to control electricity which he intends to use for his own sinister ends...This American German co-production was directed by Tim Story & is a film which has jumped on the recent bandwagon for popular Marvel comic book superhero films following the huge success of the likes of Blade (1998), X-Men (2000), Spider-Man (2002), Daredevil (2003), Hulk (2003), The Punisher (2004), the dire Elektra (2005), Ghost Rider (2007) & the upcoming Iron Man (2008) to name but some. While not the best comic book superhero adaptation Fantastic Four isn't the worst in my opinion, I mean a film has it's work cut out to be as bad as Elektra. The script by Mark Frost & Michael France follows the recent trend of comic book superhero films by trying to give the 2-D character's some personality & there's a fair amount of exposition here, a lot of the film is devoted to how each of the Fantastic Four deal with their powers & in particular how Ben copes with turning into a orange rock. This is all well & good but the von Doom angle is put on the back burner for the majority of the film & he makes for a somewhat neglected villain, I never really understood his motivation for anything. The film gives von Doom no more motive than he just wants to be powerful, wow big deal. At about 100 minutes in length it doesn't outstay it's welcome, it moves along at a reasonable pace although there aren't many big action scenes. The human character's are none existent, the clichéd relationship between Reed & Sue is just corny & overall I'd imagine Fantastic Four will appeal to fans of the comic book more than the casual viewer, I mean I don't think Fantastic Four could be enjoyed on the same level of a say Blade or Spider-Man by the average film-goer.Director Story does alright, although apart from a spectacular sequence set on a bridge & the final confrontation between the Fantastic Four & von Doom there's surprisingly little action here. Packed with CGI computer effects they vary, some are brilliant like when the Thing stands in front of an oncoming truck & it wraps itself around Thing but some are pretty poor like just about anytime Reed uses his stretch limbs. Was I the only one who found the scene when Reed literally slides down the side of the building funny? This wasn't the first time the Fantastic Four had been adapted for our screens, The Fantastic Four (1994) film was made but never intended to be released as if the company who owned the rights didn't make a film by a certain date they would lose them while there have been several cartoon show's featuring the character's. The violence is minimal & is mostly fantasy fighting between the superhero character's.According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $100,000,000 which is a lot of money so you expect a well made film & it is, although set in New York it was largely filmed in Canada. The acting varies, I though Ioan Gruffud was really bland & forgettable while the idea of Jessica Alba as a genetic scientist is more far fetched than anything else in this entire film! For those who live here in the UK Johnny Storm played by Chris Evans isn't the same Chris Evans who married Billie Piper, has ginger hair & is widely known as a DJ!Fantastic Four is a good solid comic book superhero film, there's plenty of special effects & it's looks nice enough & I suppose it passes 100 odd minutes painlessly enough as well but I thought the main story was a bit lacking & a bit too simplistic while I could have done without all the clichéd sub-plots going on. Good & certainly worth a watch particularly if you like these comic book superhero films.",6,3,6,2 January 2008
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," I didn't think it was anything special.
","Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles starts in San Francisco where journalist Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater) is approached by a centuries old Vampire named Louis (Brad Pitt) to record, document & publish his life story. Louis begins in 1791 when his wife died & he too longed for death until he met a charismatic Vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise) who turned him into a Vampire, Louis continues through the years & describes his experiences that include murder, betrayal, revenge, loneliness & love....Directed by Neil Jordan I have read plenty of positive comments & reviews on Inteview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles & maybe I'm missing something or perhaps I just watched it at the wrong time from my point of view but personally I honestly didn't think it was anything special. The script by Anne Rice based on her own novel of the same name is a bit ponderous, a little pedestrian & in my opinion lacked a strong central story. The film tells the story of Louis the Vampire, fine but it's a rather lethargic & dull story. It's a bit episodic & bitty, characters come & go a bit too easily & I couldn't get into it. The story & the way it's told didn't hold my interest, it never engaged me or made me want more & I disliked the lazy nothing ending. The character's themselves aren't that great & the dialogue tedious. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly well written & if you like these life-story type films then I'd imagine you would love it but it's not really my cup of tea.Director Jordan does a fine job, the production design is fantastic, the period sets, locations, costumes & props are top drawer although the tens of millions spent on it probably helped... There's no real scares in it as it goes for realistic brutal violence, this is a story driven horror film for the intellectuals who look down upon us horror fans & consider horror only just above porn. There's some good gore in it, Tom Cruise gets his throat slit in graphic detail, there's plenty of wrist slitting, neck biting, blood drinking, a decapitation & a cool bit where someone is sliced in half with a scythe.With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles has the top notch production values that you would expect a big budget Hollywood film to have. Despite it's very impressive cast list I didn't think the acting was that great & no one stood out for me except a young Kirsten Dunst who I thought was highly annoying & bratty as Claudia.Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles is an OK film, it's got some decent gore & it's very nice to look at but I thought it lacked a strong central story & didn't particularly entertain me. Followed by the absolutely awful Queen of the Damned (2002).",5,1,7,11 November 2006
The Birds," Not particularly impressed to be honest.
","The Birds starts in a San Francisco pet store where rich socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) is about to pick up a Mynah bird for her aunt when a lawyer named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) decides to play a joke on her & assume she's a shop assistant. Taken back by Mitch's charm & sense of humour Melanie decides to track him down & calls in a favour to find out where he lives, it turns out that Mitch spends every weekend at a small coastal town called Bodega Bay & drives down there herself where she meets his mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy) & younger sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). Mitch & Melanie fall for each other but find Lydia opposed to the relationship, meanwhile the birds in Bodega Bay have been acting strangely. At first it was the odd isolated attack but it has grown into full scale destruction as huge flocks of birds attack anybody they come across...Produced & directed by Alfred Hitchcock & loosely based on the short story by Daphne Du Maurier The Birds has an imposing reputation, the sort of reputation that gives it classic status, unfortunately I must admit that I didn't actually like The Birds that much for several reasons. The biggest reason why I didn't like The Birds is because it's so slow, during the first fifty odd minutes next to nothing happens & for me the silly romantic game of cat & mouse between Melanie & Mitch just wasn't enough to maintain my interest & when Lydia the mother got involved I was wondering if anything was going to happen at all. To it's credit The Birds does pick up for the second half but it's a little bit too late to save the film, while I understand about the deliberate way The Birds builds up with just the odd attack or the odd gathering of birds during the first hour or so but that still didn't make it any more enjoyable with it's dreary romantic subplot that dominates the first half. At almost two hours long it felt like an effort to reach the end which it shouldn't have. The script is rather ambiguous, no solid explanation is given to the bird attacks, no explanation is given as to why Bodega Bay is the center of the attacks & there's that nothing sort of ending which neither has the birds or humanity triumphant so in effect there's no cause or resolution & the whole film feels a bit empty. Undeniably influential & much loved I can actually see where they are coming from but The Birds just didn't do much for me, sorry.Hitchcock was a master of his art, of that there is no doubt & even here in The Birds there are some terrific individual moments like the flock of black Crow's gathering on school playground climbing frames behind Melanie or an aerial shot of Bodega Bay after an explosion that starts off clear but soon dozens of Gull's have flapped into view & head straight for the town or the final attack on Melanie. The setting is nice & Bodega Bay has turned up in another couple of horror films The Fog (1980) & Puppetmaster (1989). The Birds hasn't dated too badly, sure some of the fashions & cars have but the special effects are quite good & the locations still probably look like this even now. There's a bit of blood & there's a dead body with it's eyes pecked out, but it's only seen briefly & the amount of character's that smoke in The Birds is very noticeable as they light up at every opportunity. Oddly there is no musical soundtrack to The Birds, one of the few films not to feature any incidental music.With a supposed budget of about $2,500,000 The Birds has great production values & decent effects for it's time, filmed on location at Bodega Bay & back at Universal Studios in Los Angeles. The acting is pretty good, Tippi Hedren (who is the mother of actress Melanie Griffith) & Rod Taylot make a nice enough couple & play off each other with a sense of humour.The Birds is a film that I just couldn't get into, while I appreciate it's strong points of which there are a few the negatives completely swamp them & turn what could have been a great film into a dreary & boring one with no sense of reason or resolution behind it. A made for television sequel The Birds II: Land's End (1994) was apparently crap enough for original director Rick Rosenthal to have his name removed from the credits & replaced with the standard Alan Smithee.",4,3,16,1 November 2010
Jurassic Park," 'He's gonna eat the Goat?' Top notch Dinosaur entertainment for all the family.
","Jurassic Park is set on an island just off the coast of Costa Rica which rich billionaire businessman John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) rents from the Government, within it's lush green jungles Hammond has created a new type of tourist attraction. The whole island has been converted into a giant theme park called Jurassic Park, a theme park where the paying public can take a tour & see real life Dinosaurs including Triceraptops, herds of Galamides, a Brontosaurs, Velociraptors & even a T-Rex that have been brought back from extinction by means of using Dinosaur DNA from blood found in fossilised Mosquitos. However, in an accident a worker has been killed & Hammond's investors get nervous about the safety issues that surround Jurassic Park so in an attempt to reassure them Hammond invites esteemed palaeontologist's Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) & Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) along with scientist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) & lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to tour the park & hopefully endorse it. Unfortunately things don't go the way Hammond was expecting as a ferocious thunder storm hits the island at the same time treacherous employee Dennis Nerdy (Wayne Knight) shuts down the security fences so he can make his escape after stealing Dinosaur embryos that he plans to sell to a rival company. With the security fences off line the Dinosaurs are free to go wherever they please & the human inhabitants on the island find themselves hunted by the Dinosaurs...Directed by Steven Spielberg Jurassic Park was a monster-sized (sorry) smash hit at the box-office when it came out & held the record until Titanic (1997) came along, it still makes for great viewing even after all these years. The script by Michael Crichton & David Keopp was based on the novel by Crichton of the same name, in fact Jurassic Park the film went into production before the novel even came out. The film is great basically, there are lots of spectacular big budget set pieces that look good even now, there's some stunning special effects that still hold up really well & the Dinosaur human interaction is as good as anything else put on film with the likes of a huge T-Rex chasing a jeep through the jungle looking impressive. The story is reasonably plausible & it doesn't get too bogged down in scientific jargon, the various story threads all come together pretty well although I'd liked to have seen a few more people get eaten. Alive if possible. Most of the character's are likable & even the teenage kids weren't that annoying apart from a scene when Lex (Ariana Richards) can't seem to do something as simple as turn a flashlight off yet later on in the film she manages to operate one of the most sophisticated computers on the planet & use it to reboot the entire theme park electrical system! There is one exception though, I have to say that Laura Dern's scientist irritated me beyond belief, I don't know if it was Dern or the character but I really wish she'd got eaten. Slowly. My only real complaint with Jurassic Park is the pace, once it gets going around the 50 minute mark it's top entertainment all the way to the finish line but until that point I found it rather slow going with lots of very deliberate 'explanations' & exposition scenes that feel forced, it's the sort of dialogue that you know the filmmakers stick in there on purpose to get the audience up to speed like all the talk about how deadly the Velociraptors are & how they hunt. I'm all for build up & character development but I personally don't like long films, I just don't as I begin to loose interest & become bored so I'd have preferred Jurassic Park to have been at least 15 or 20 minutes shorter. This is a small complaint & Jurassic Park is still a thrilling action packed family horror film & I don't care what anyone says it's definitely a horror film & if it had been made by anyone other than family friendly Spielberg that's how everyone would describe it.Director Spielberg films the special effect & action scenes with panache & there are some cool sequences like the T-Rex eating a Goat whole (excellent!, as Tim (Joseph Mazzello) exclaims), attacking the jeeps & the Velocirators at the climax hunting the kids in the kitchen. Everything looks, sounds & feels great with brilliant special effects & CGI. The film has some nice scary moments & a few instances of mild gore & violence so it may not be suitable for very young children.With a supposed budget of about $63,000,000 Jurassic Park is technically excellent & set the standard for just about every special effects film thereafter. Some of the Costa Rican locations look gorgeous although I believe most of it was shot in California. The acting was alright but the real stars here are the Dinosaurs so it doesn't matter that much. This was Richard Attenboroughs first film in 15 years, Samuel L. Jackson has a small role & he would obviously go on to mega stardom, Sam Neill is OK, as already mentioned I thought Dern was awful while Goldblum is as likable as ever & steals every scene he's in.Jurassic Park is a great film, it's as simple & straight forward as that. It has brilliant special effects, cool set pieces, great Dinosaur action & makes for terrific Saturday afternoon type entertainment. What more do you want? I would imagine there aren't to many people on planet Earth who hasn't seen it yet but if your one of the few then what are you waiting for? Two great sequels followed, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) & Jurassic Park III (2001) while Jurassic Park IV (2008) is currently in pre-production according to the IMDb.",8,5,11,22 July 2006
Evil Dead II," Very similar to the original, but still great entertainment.
","The opening of Evil Dead II consists of mostly a montage of shots of the Necrinomicon 'the Book of the Dead' and a spoken narration that goes, 'legend has it it was written by the dark one, Necrinomicon Ex Mortis roughly translated Book of the Dead. The book served as a passageway to the evil worlds beyond, it was written long ago when the seas ran red with blood. It was this blood that was used to ink the book. In the year 1300 A.D. the book disappeared.' Ashley 'Ash' Williams (Bruce Campbell) along with his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) are traveling by car deep into some woods to a remote mountain cabin. After some brief romantic shenanigans Ash finds a tape player. He decides to have a listen, the tape recording was made by the cabins owner Professor Raymond Knowby (John Peaks). He talks of traveling to a an ancient castle and discovering the Book of the Dead. Professor Knowby continues and explains that the Book of the Dead spoke about passageways to another world and contains demon resurrection incantations. Ash continues to listen, Professor Knowby begins to translate aloud the incantations which awake the evil spirits within the woods. All of a sudden Ash hears the sound of breaking glass and when he investigates he finds Linda has disappeared. Ash goes outside and starts to look for her, she turns up and is possessed. She attacks Ash but he chops her head off with a shovel. Ash buries Linda and quickly finds out he is trapped as the bridge he used to get to the cabin has been destroyed. He heads back to the cabin where he must try and survive to the morning and the safety of the sunlight. Meanwhile Annie Knowby (Sarah Berry) Professor Knowby's daughter and Ed Getley (Richard Domeier) have landed at a nearby airport with the missing pages from the Book of the Dead and decide to head straight for the cabin. They soon find out that the bridge has been destroyed but hire Jake (Dan Hicks) and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva as Kassie Wesley) to show them to the cabin via a trail through the woods. Once there they find the cabin in a bad state, blood on the floors, a blood stained chainsaw, no sign of Annie's parents and Ash covered in blood holding a shotgun. They lock him in the fruit cellar. As the night draws on it becomes apparent that Ash isn't alone in the cellar and as the group start to be reduced in number by the evil spirits the survivors start to realize that the woods contain evil that wants to kill them all, Dead by Dawn! They must try to find a way to defeat the evil and try and save themselves. Co-written and again directed by Sam Raimi with a much improved budget, who like the original has a small cameo at the end as a medieval soldier. This is another great film, again full of cool camera tricks and angles and memorable sequences, it's no surprise Raimi has gone onto great success in Hollywood with Spider-Man (2002) and it's sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004). The script by Raimi and Scott Spiegel moves like a rocket, just the way it should but I couldn't help thinking it was a little too similar to the original, in fact I'd sooner call this a remake rather than a direct sequel. Lots of great scenes and cool one liners in this, like when Ash puts Linda's decapitated head into a vice and tightens it up, as Linda's head laughs and taunts Ash he points at it and says 'your going down!' just before Linda's headless body bursts into the work shed and attacks Ash with a chainsaw. Or when Ash is looking at himself in a mirror after he had just killed Linda and says 'fine' his reflection suddenly jumps out, grabs him and says 'I don't think so, we just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw, does that sound fine?!', the shot ends with Ash's reflection strangling the real Ash but the camera zooms out to reveal Ash's own hands around his throat. A sequence where the possessed Linda is dancing as her body spins around independently of her decapitated head, which remains in the same position looking towards Ash throughout the spin. A funny sequence where Ash's own possessed hand beats himself up, smashing plates and bottles over his head and punching himself in the stomach! Ash goes onto cut his hand off with a chainsaw and puts a bucket over his still alive possessed hand and puts some books on it, one of which is Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms! A really nice touch of black humor. Or the getting tooled up scene in the work shed where Ash fixes the chainsaw to his wrist and saws the barrel of his shotgun off after which the camera zooms in on his face and he quips 'groovy!'. A short dialogue scene where Ash thinks he heard a noise in a bedroom and wanting to take a look he says 'we'll all go in together' to which Jake answers 'hell no! Your the curious one'. Or the shots of a stag's head over the fireplace that comes alive, turns to Ash and starts to laugh at him, and a rocking chair in the corner of the room that starts to creepily rock on it's own. Again Raimi goes overboard with the 'dead cam' point-of-view shots, and continuous unbroken shots where the evil spirits follow Ash around the cabin breaking doors down and the like, I could probably carry on but hopefully you get the idea. Acting is much improved over the original and Campbell is still great as Ash. The effects are also much better this time around, according to the booklet supplied with my DVD no less than three FX groups were brought together to make Evil Dead II work. Having said that rather disappointingly there isn't much on screen gore. When anything graphic is supposed to be happening it's usually off screen or rather tame, Ash's hand amputation is off screen, when Ash kills Linda it's in shadow, when he kills 'Evil Ed' with an axe it's mostly off screen, Bobby Joe's death isn't seen and Jake death is just a ridiculous amount of spurting blood from cellar that looks like red water. Some of the effects look dodgy particularly the stop motion animation and living severed hand sequences. The ending in which the evil is turned into a physical being I thought was a bit over ambitious and a turned out a little flat. Overall another great film, I was just a bit disappointed by the restrained gore and violence when compared to the original, by comparison in the original when Ash decapitates Linda with a shovel and her headless body falls on him, a large amount of blood from the wound squirts out all over his face. In the sequel when Ash decapitates Linda there is not a single drop of blood spilt and when Ash dismembers 'Evil Ed' when his blood splashes over the walls it's green and looks more like washing up liquid. However, I highly recommend it to horror fans and is still one hell of an entertaining horror film that's great fun at the same time. Watch it, as soon as you can.",8,2,8,4 December 2004
V for Vendetta," Really surprised at how much I liked this, why did it take me so long to watch it?
","V for Vendetta is set in a future Britian where the country is now under the strict dictatorship of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), the date is November the 5th as TV production assistant Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) breaks a late night curfew & is attacked by two of Sutler's secret police force the Fingermen but is saved by a man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask who calls himself V (Hugo Weaving). V takes Evey to witness the blowing up of the Old Bailey for which he is responsible, the following day at the British Television Network studios V breaks in & broadcasts a message to Britian claiming he is a modern day freedom fighter who has taken the guise of Guy Fawkes & like Fawkes will try to bring the oppressive Government down. Sutler's security forces try to find V while he sets out on a personal revenge mission...This American, British & German co-production was the directorial debut of James McTeigue & I must admit that I am amazed that V for Vendetta is in the IMDb user voted Top 250 films (well within the top 200 as well) but at the same time pleasantly surprised because I thought V for Vendetta was a terrific film that has so much going for it. Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore (who has said he didn't like the film) & David Lloyd (who has said he did like the film) I didn't expect such a great film, while the original graphic novel was about V on a quest to create anarchy rather than freedom from an oppressive Government I think the film works extremely well & a lot f it seemed very relevant & topical. Lets be honest, V for Vendetta has a dig at the likes of George Bush & Tony Blair as it presents Britian in the near future as a society run by a dictator & a corrupt Government who have twisted the war on terrorism, the need for security & the fears ordinary people have to take away people civil liberties & freedom just like we are heading towards right now if truth be told. I could also relate to the way Sutler uses & manipulates the media, it's all quite close to home & familiar actually. At over two hours I was never bored by a largely talky film, it held my interest from stat to finish with some great writing, some touching writing, some humorous writing, some exciting writing & some satirical writing. The character's are all strong & there's one great twist about half way through I didn't see coming that was genuine surprise that at first seemed a bit odd but then after thinking about it seemed totally logical.Based on a comic book there's a great visual style to the film, from the cool fighting & action scenes to some surprisingly touching scenes sensitively shot. I loved the idea of using Guy Fawkes, I am not sure if he is that well known outside of the UK but here the 5th of November is celebrated every year & Fawkes story is know to all. The idea of using the morals & image of Fawkes & the ideas behind the image is a great one that works perfectly (but I guess you would have to know of Fawkes for it to). The special effects are impressive with a cool shot of the House of Parliment being blown up at the end. There is some blood & violence but overall there's more talk although when the action does arrive it's cool. I also loved the dominoes bit, sure it's pointless but it looks great & since it took over 200 hours to set up in reality a lot of time went into creating it.With a supposed budget of about $54,000,000 this wasn't as big budgeted as some Hollywood films although it does look great & is surely one of the most political films released during the decade, the parallels between the future society seen in V for Vendetta & the the way our own is heading is there for all to see & the similarity between Sutler & certain other well known leaders is also striking. The acting is great from all expect Portman who is a bit flat although tremendous credit goes to Hugo Weaving who manages to put in a great performance & give V real depth despite being hidden behind a mask the entire film.V for Vendetta is a marvellous film, both as an action fantasy with lush visuals & as an extreme look at where society is heading, the ambiguity surrounding the character of V helps too as a sort of masked hero who simply just stands for ideas & values. A new personal favourite of mine, I highly recommend it.",8,2,9,28 August 2010
