Scarface," One of the best movies to ever hit the big screen
","At least this is my opinion regarding this movie... One of Pacino's greatest performances and probably one of the greatest performances ever given by an actor. A deep, realistic story, which is also very entertaining, with clever dialogue and many famous quotes. Maybe it's just my point of view, but I feel that even today, 22 years after it's release, this movie hasn't really aged a bit! No matter how old you are, no matter what your favorite movie genre is, you could easily enjoy this movie & fall in love with it. The only problem one could have against Scarface is the fact that it's too violent and.... well.... there is a lot of swearing going on and i mean A LOT. But somehow all the swearing and violence used in this movie have a purpose, unlike in movies nowadays... So my advice is: if you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely watch it... if you've already seen it, watch it again!",10,0,1,7 December 2005
The Godfather," The movie that will never die
","A masterpiece, a truly amazing performance from probably the greatest actors of all time: Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The acting is flawless, the story is superb and the director, Francis Ford Coppola, is a genius.A fascinating movie that I'm sure everyone should love; the tragic way in which Michael Corleone is transformed in a powerful Mafia leader who shows no mercy to anyone in order to keep his family 'in business'The movie is 3 hours long, but you will be so caught in the action, you won't even notice the time passing by. This is a movie that you can watch once or twice a year without getting bored. I watched it probably 20 times, and every time i watch it I love it more and more... My advice is: Watch This Movie! (if you haven't done that already)",10,0,2,30 July 2004
