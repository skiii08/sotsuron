The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Chbosky's literature vision is now a beautiful motion picture film
","After hearing about this coming-of-age story, I insisted myself to read the book, in order to get an idea of what was to come from the film. To be honest, I was worried that this wasn't going to come out great, especially since the director was Chobsky (the author of the book) himself. Me saying that may surprise some people, but if you think about it, he's an author. Author's might not have the same abilities as directors do. I was proved so wrong. Chbosky DOMINATED this book into a superbly acted, brilliantly written, and well formatted film that will inspire many teens and adults. Ezra Miller is once again spectacular as the flamboyant mentor of the protagonist. Emma Watson is as lovely as always. And, for once, I was touched so deeply by Logan Lerman's acting. This film is not only proof of the talents of the actors, but of Chbosky's directing. Containing some beautiful imagery, powerful and devastating situations, this film is must see, and bound to get some Oscar buzz.",9,1,2,13 October 2012
The Hunger Games," Satisfying, but not for Ross
","There are many positives about this film (the acting, the cinematography, the casting, the set, the costuming and make-up). But, there are some flaws (the depth of setting up the games and the lack of emotions in the games, the lack of Howard's music ability, the unrealistic images of the people who are 'apparently' starving, and the unnecessary spoilers for the next film). Now is this a bad film? Absolutely not! This film overpowers the flaws with astounding acting from the older actors, particularly Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland, spectacular cinematography that, though may feel nauseous at times, feels as if the audience is in the games, some beautiful set designs, and memorizing costumes and make-up. Plus, with not as big as a budget as most films, Ross does a good job in creating the atmosphere of the novel. One thing I wish had happened was that Ross had focused more on filming the intensity of the games that was portrayed in the novel, but it is quite difficult to create a film that is better than it's adaptation. This probably wasn't the best film for Gary Ross to direct, but it wasn't a disappointment.",8,1,5,11 August 2012
Argo," Ben Affleck with another hit
","I'm going to be very honest: Ben Affleck is not a good actor, rather descent. But as a director, Ben Affleck is INCREDIBLE, whether you want to admit it or not. Gone Baby Gone and The Town showed that Affleck had skill/talent behind the screen, but he has proved himself as one of the big boys with Argo. The film has a very beautiful mixture of tension, drama, and even dark comedy. The casting is totally phenomenal with how much each actor emulates the real person. Since this is a true story, most people will go see this knowing the outcome, but the film isn't about the outcome, but rather the outrageous tactic the CIA took to bring back the Americans. This film is no doubt an Oscar candidate for it's achieving script, performances, and direction. A must see indeed, go check out Argo.",10,1,4,14 October 2012
The Hateful Eight," Great presentation. Average movie.
","I'm not going to go too in depth on this review, just point out the pros and cons of the film as simply as I can.What largely bothered me about this bombastically crafted 3 hour western is that it never felt like a true Tarantino movie. When you look at his filmography, you can see such innovation and creativity in his filmmaking. But here....it's like he recycled his own work and compiled it up to make this movie (aka Django Unchained meets Reservoir Dogs meets Kill Bill Volume II). The dialogue is never as witty as it should be. The plot is a little too over the top for how simple it really is (I saw the end coming the moment the characters step into the cabin). There are only brief moments of Tarantino's violent style (a huge let down compared to Inglorious Bastards and Django Unchained). And the N-word is far too gratuitous. Perhaps there's a deeper meaning behind this film, but I honestly did not see it if it was there. On a good note, Jennifer Jason Leigh is incredible as Daisy and definitely the stand out. The score is undeniably riveting and silly at the same time. The cinematography is gorgeous. The artistic outcome of the film is unique and dazzling. I guess that's what makes this movie worth seeing: the experience. Tarantino took so much time and effort to present his film in the best possible manner, which is the case (no IMAX experience can beat 70MM film being projected in Panavision). It is great to be able to go back in time and experience new cinema as if you were in old Hollywood. It's truly a glamorous experience.",5,36,85,21 December 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," Sooooooooooo good
","I was fortunate enough to make it into the Austin Film Festival screening of this film, and my god it was worth the wait. David O. Russel has outdone himself with this beautiful portrayal of a dysfunctional family searching for a way to come together. Bradley Cooper has won me finally with his odd and hilarious character. Jennifer Lawrence is dashing as ever with the hysterical role of Tiffany, a depressed woman trying to find a way out of her issues. This whole film has powerhouse performances, a laugh-out-loud script with heart, and a way to get the audience attached to its likable characters. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, and you are sure to see this as Osacr buzz.",10,203,349,21 October 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Is a remake necessary?
","After watching this remake, I came out of it in a dispute with my family. The truth is that this remake should have waited maybe five to ten more years. It may not seem so soon, but it is! All I could do was think about Tobey and Kirsten throughout the movie. If you can get passed that, then you're in for a romantic treat. By saying that, I mean it. The entire film is led by the chemistry between the two leads. Are their performances good? No doubt! Is Garfield a better Spider-Man? In my opinion, no. He has the fine looks, lean body, and talent, but that's not enough. Maguire had the quirky look, awkward aspects and built figure to become a hero who the audience had sympathy for. All the sympathy in this film is at the end of the movie, when a character dies, rather than with anything revolving around Garfield. This film has plenty of dazzling visual effects and epic action sequences, but sadly, it isn't needed at the moment. If you're looking for new and fresh material, skip this film. If you want to go on a date or see an action film, go to the theaters, especially IMAX.",6,1,3,6 August 2012
It Follows," A chilling take on 80s teen horror films
","From the moment the film opens to the last seconds, there is always a sense that something isn't right. The music is hinting at an inevitable threat, the camera is slowly panning or tracking in order to help reveal what is lurking, and the actors interactions with one another make the audience forget that at any moment 'it' will appear. Director David Robert Mitchell does something that many horror-genre filmmakers have lost sight of: what scares people the most is their imagination. Yes, the film occasionally showcases some terrifying images, but it's the moments when everything seems fine where the fear skyrockets out of the audience. I'm not going to say that this is the scariest film I've ever seen, but when it resembles the thread of 'A Nightmare on Elm Street,' the tension of 'Alien,' and the style of 'The Conjuring,' it comes pretty close to it. It is very original, well executed, and a refreshing film for all cinephiles. But most importantly, it stays with you even after the movie ends and makes you question your actions...and your surroundings.",10,86,180,10 March 2015
Beasts of No Nation," A harrowing, yet breathtaking masterpiece
","I've always admired Cary Fukunaga's style of filming since his first feature 'Sin Nombre.' And I was so glad that people were able to experience the skills he has after his breakout hit in television with 'True Detective.' However, 'Beasts of No Nation' boasts more to Fukunaga that 'True Detective,' 'Sin Nombre,' and 'Jane Eyre' were not able to. Fukunaga shows his humanistic nature and masterful skill of film through the mise-en-scene. He utilizes the camera to evoke the darkest parts of humanity through the colors, the emptiness of the set pieces, and the vulnerability of the actors (particularly Abraham Attah). Though the structure of the script differs from the novel it's based on, the essence of Uzodinma Iweala's words are clearly present in the best way possible. The elements of the film are also exemplary such as the eerie synthetic score, the mostly hand-held camera-work, and the editing (particularly a sequence that dazzles when the natural color of the environment fades into a sobering pink). And it would be a crime to not mention Idris Elba's transformative performance (which will leave viewers eager to see more of his talent in the future). Much like 'Sin Nombre,' this is a brutally honest depiction of the nature of violence that never ceases to make you feel uncomfortable and horrified (though it it is not as explicit as 'True Detective'). Fukunaga is not just a talented filmmaker, but he is also a sympathetic anthropologist and a culturally-engaged humanist who seeks to learn more about people and to let the world know what they are ignorant of.",10,3,6,18 October 2015
The Bourne Legacy," A change in the Bourne series, indeed
","Tony Gilroy decides to take the director's seat in the next establishment of the Bourne series. Despite not having Matt Damon running the show, there is an impressive lead from Jeremy Renner, alongside the always dashing Rachel Weisz. With very intense action sequences and an intellectual script, this film has itself going...until the plot kicks in. Unfortunately, Gilroy isn't really able to bring the stories together, with Renner trying to run away from Treadstone, but trying to get from them the substances that made him strong and smart, and Norton trying to stop the media from getting more information that Bourne and Pam Landy let loose. If you're going out to see an action film, you might want to skip this one, especially when 10 minutes of the 135 minute film are action. Now, if you love a film filled with dialog and great acting, then this is the one.This film proves that the Bourne series is at its end, but is still entertaining.",7,2,6,13 August 2012
Sinister," Finally, a horror worth seeing
","The past few years have not shown anything worth being scared by. The found footage genres, though as clever as they can be, are running dry. Sinister, though, does something different with the found footage genre, as well as horror. This film is a straight forward ride into a disturbing and sadistic story of evil, with some clichÃ©d and creative scares. Ethan Hawke is committed to his role 100 percent as the protagonist trying to find a story that will bring him fame once again. It is his lust for fame that proves to be his and his family's downfall. I truly believe this film will either scare you or indent it's gloomy/frightening imagery into your mind. Spectacular on visuals, creative on scares, and well acted by the leads, Sinister is a great way to start out the Halloween season.",7,2,4,13 October 2012
The Big Short," Looks can be deceiving...
","I'm not one to fall for movie trailers after growing up being deceived by them, so I only expected this movie to be a comedy because of critic reviews. Now I definitely don't trust critics. I walked out of this movie feeling terrified at the world economy and disgusted by the people who touch our hard earning money. Perhaps this is out of ignorance of not knowing, but The Big Short does a superb job at giving us the back story of the 2008 collapse. I am very impressed with Adam McKay's approach to this movie (an example of how directors can change for the better). The editing is frenetic, going beyond viewer expectations and making you feel annoyed by the numerous freeze frames, the sudden faults with the sound, and so on. The acting is impeccable (particularly from Steve Carrel and Christian Bale). The script is intelligent, riotous, slick, and brutally honest. There are creative ways to explain how this industry works to people like me who do not know a lot about banking and Wall Street. People are going to try to compare this to Wolf of Wall Street, but it's very different. To be 100% honest, though, this is going to be a half and half for people. Some people will love it, others will find it irritating or just satisfying. I loved it, but that's my personal feeling.",9,1,6,23 December 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," Anderson at his BEST!!
","I've always been a fan of odd movies, especially Wes Anderson's style. After listening to many reviews (some good, some bad, some really good), I decided to watch it myself. There's really no other way to put it...PHENOMENAL. Anderson proved himself to be one of the greatest directors of our time. In reality, this idea would have seemed...well, strange and not in the slightest interest of most people. Anderson, though, said 'This is my story, and I'm going to make it the best film of the year,' which so far is true. Everything about this film is perfect (excluding the newcoming lead actors), from the cinematography to the beautiful coloring to the hilarious yet profound set. The cast was chosen so well, especially Bill Murray as the father and Edward Norton as the Boy Scout leader. I recommend this film to anyone, even if you're not into the Indie style. This film is heart- warming, delightful, quirky, and sometimes a bit touching. Go support Anderson's latest and undoubtedly his best film yet.",10,4,7,4 August 2012
Pitch Perfect," A great teen flick for all
","Lately, the movie industry has been preying on teens with stupid, underdeveloped, and unoriginal films. Pitch Perfect is a stylish and bouncy film about a cappella singing groups who know how to make a show. Though the story is not necessarily original, the way the film is presented is what makes it thrive. Rebel Wilson and Hana Mae Lee practically own this film with their hilarious performances. Anna Kendrick is as impressive as ever. Brittany Snow shows off her talents of singing and acting. Overall, this is a fun film to watch. If the singing and remixes of songs don't get to you, the characters and little love story will. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to enjoy themselves and get a very good laugh.",8,0,2,13 October 2012
Looper," Rian Johnson...I love you
","Rian Johnson...he's extremely talented, and he definitely proves it with Looper, a mixture of sci-fi/1970s brutality. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant in this film, taking the task of mimicking Bruce Willis in a phenomenal way. The chemistry between the two leads in undeniably rude, comedic, and heart-breaking. But what makes this film profound is the story you think you know (based on the trailers). Let me tell you now, this film is not about a looper trying to kill his future self. There's far more to this film than that. What starts out as an action-packed thriller turns into a humanism story of the questions of right and wrong. Please go watch this film AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! If I was asked to recommend one film from 2012 to watch, it would have to be this one.",10,2,23,29 September 2012
Joy," Jennifer Lawrence in top form once again!
","Let me begin by saying this is not David O. Russell's strongest film. What made American Hustle, Silver Linging's Playbook, and The Fighter tour de forces were the complexities of every character. Joy's main (and quite frankly only) focus is on Jennifer Lawrence's character. In that sense, it is superb. The other characters aren't flushed out very well. However, that doesn't mean this movie isn't satisfying. The story is just fascinating and intriguing, I was honestly surprised how at the edge of my seat I was at times. The soundtrack is exquisite (as always with his films). The distinct editing style of David O. Russell films is there (which I personally adore very much). And though the supporting cast is never as compelling as most David O. Russell films, they do add the thrive of the main character's goals. I give it an 8 out of 10.",Null,4,26,23 December 2015
