Lucky Number Slevin," Fun But Predictable.
","I think this movie is the victim of many very clever movies before it. It's difficult to mislead an audience and have a surprise ending that actually surprises any more. Unlike many recent great 'surprise ending' movies, like Usual Suspects, Sixth Sense, Memento and Seven, I was always one step ahead of guessing what was going to happen next in Lucky Number Slevin. Had Slevin come out before any of those others I mentioned it might be in the same category. Unfortunately it is not. The style of Slevin is very nice and there are some great clever moments. I found myself entertained by it. But I felt myself entertained in the same way as watching a movie I've seen several times already, detecting early on the clues that would eventually reveal the big secret at the end. And the reveals were slow enough that even if you're not looking for them you can see them coming. Because of this it feels more like a rental than a gotta-go-out-and-see-it one. Probably explains why it didn't do so hot at the box office.",6,7,14,8 July 2006
Crash," Good Movie, Even if Sensationalized
","Crash, baring in mind it is not at all real, is an excellent film. If people want to find truth in it though, this is not the place. It is no more nor less a representation of reality than JFK or other conspiratorial types of films. Crash makes it seem as if Los Angeles is about ready to erupt into mass hysteria with racial battle-lines being drawn as people arm themselves. This is not the case-- at least not in the affluent areas or even middle-class areas. In the areas of Los Angeles stricken by poverty this might be more prevalent, although its a statistical fact that most violence in those areas are people inflicting harm on others of the same race. Having said that, lets address Crash as a pure piece of fiction. It is very well crafted, with excellent characters and great performances. Like an episodic, I found myself wanting to know what happened to a particular character next, while at the same time being sucked into the next character and story line just as quickly. Excellent film-making.",8,0,3,7 July 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Truth or Fiction? Does it Matter?
","This film was neither as good as the hype nor as bad as the backlash. It was what it was-- another Hollywood film blown out of proportion with an all star cast, good production value (except some of the shots seemed a bit underexposed at times) excellent soundtrack... and blas√© unoriginal narrative. For someone like me the believability is not crucial because I find it no more or less believable than the stuff they try to teach us in Sunday school, although from a purist point of view I can understand why someone might be strongly opposed to it. What the detractors should realize is that their fire-branded criticism contributes to the hype as much as any advertising paid for by the studio. For that reason it became a must-see movie. And apart from the hype there's no big rush to go and see it.",6,2,4,6 July 2006
