Saturday Night Fever," A lot better than you'd think... (*a couple of spoilers within*)
","There are some people who, at the mere mention of the words 'Saturday Night Fever' giggle or smirk or give you a 'You actually watch that movie?' look as if it's a piece of celluloid which people only took seriously from 1977 to 1979. Most of the people who have that attitude either have never sat down to watch the whole movie (these people probably think Travolta wore the white suit throughout all 120 minutes of the film and think that the whole thing took place inside the discotheque), or they've never seen the movie at all and have relied on what others say, or they just loathe disco music (and for these latter people, there's not much that can be done).But if you look at the movie in its entirety--the R rated version, preferably (the PG version is too watered down and isn't the Real Thing)--you will be surprised at just how genuinely involving and worthy the movie is. You will also be surprised by how great Travolta is. Yes, he plays a character similar to his Vinnie Barbarino TV character in that both are Italian, working-class, and native to Brooklyn, but the similarities end there. While Barbarino is shallow and awkwardly cool, Tony Manero is deep and smoothly hip; while Barbarino is happy-go-lucky, Manero is seriously troubled and doubtful about many things; while Barbarino is dim-witted, Manero is not only street-smart but also people-smart: he sees right through his dance partner Stephanie's refined veneer, and through his father's superior facade.The point here is that Travolta proved in 'SNF' that he's the Real Deal--not just a pretty face or a good dancer or a comic actor but an ACTOR, period. And the Oscar nomination he received for his performance is evidence of that. I personally don't think Travolta has given a performance since then which is as consistently on-target, nuanced, and powerful as the one he gives in this movie (and yes, I'm including 'Pulp Fiction' when I make that statement).I won't say much about the music because everybody knows by now how great and attention-grabbing it is. But what doesn't get as much credit are the movie's director and story. John Badham nicely captures the energy of the disco, especially in the Line-Dancing/Hustle scene at the half-hour point: he gives the scene a dreamy quality complete with camera Dissolves and smoke, and he's not afraid to take his time and let the scene play on. Anyone who's ever been on the dance floor knows that sensation: the feeling that time has stopped and all that exists are you and the music.Many people have said that the movie's weakest aspect is its story. They say it's unnecessarily sordid, ugly, and disturbing. In fact, the movie's original choice for director--another John- John G. Avildsen--declined to do the film because he felt the story was too downbeat. But I think the downbeat quality is just as necessary an ingredient of the story as its disco music. One of the movie's points is that Disco is an escape, a multi-colored paradise in which Tony Manero and everyone else for that matter can forget about the ugly, unfair world patiently waiting for them outside. That's why Tony flips out toward the end at the dance contest when the Top Prize unfairly goes to him and Stephanie instead of to the more deserving Puerto Rican couple. He sees that the injustice of the outside world has pierced through the silver walls of the disco world---a world which he had always thought was too special, pure, and innocent to allow that inside; and now, that world has been tainted...with Reality.Another quality of the film that tends to get overlooked is the supporting acting. I'm surprised that most people have cited Karen Lynn Gorney's performance as being among the movie's weaknesses. I think people say that because Travolta's presence is so charismatic and overwhelming that her contribution has gotten eclipsed. But if you take a good look at her performance you'll see that she creates a convincing, impressive portrait of a woman fiercely struggling with what she wants to be, what she is, and what she used to be. Gorney's Stephanie is a fascinating character: a woman with a goddess' face but a Brooklyn-gutter-girl's voice.I saw 'SNF' when it first came out--I was 5-years-old; now I'm 30, and I will always remember the powerful effect the movie had on me. Even at age 5, I was surprised at how great Travolta was and how engrossing the story and music were. And that's why I keep coming back to it--to relive that experience over and over and over...like a favorite record.",Null,7,7,2 March 2003
Heat," 'Heat' should've been called 'Lukewarm' (**ONE SPOILER AHEAD**)
","I saw this movie when it first came out because I, like most people, couldn't wait to see Pacino and DeNiro finally act, FACE TO FACE, in a movie together. And I also figured that the story was probably poignant and powerful if it was able to attract those 2 heavyweight actors. So my expectations going in were very high; when the closing credits were scrolling up the screen, I said to myself 'Hmm, well, okay, it was good, but was that the best Michael Mann could do???'You see, any movie starring PACINO and DENIRO can't just be good--it has to be freakin' AMAZING, EXCELLENT, RIVETING. And this movie was none of those things. Let's face it, 'Heat' is really just a cops-and-robbers TV show padded up with fancy, swirling cinematography, a high-wattage cast (also including Voight, Kilmer, Judd, Portman, Levine, etc.), a big budget, and epic treatment. How many times have we seen movies about an obsessive cop going after a hardened, seen-it-all bank robber??Mann tries to disguise his trite, cliched story by trying to have us believe his version is somehow 'different' or deeper by providing subplots involving Pacino's unfulfilled wife, DeNiro's tentative relationship with Amy Brenneman (whose character is the least interesting and most thankless of all the roles), Kilmer's hot/cold marriage, and other little subplots that seem to exist for no reason other than to create filler so that this simple cops-and-robbers story can seem Epic, Grand. The problem with these subplots is that each and every one of them are not particularly compelling or original: Pacino's wife wants him to spend more time with her, DeNiro wants to settle down with Brenneman but not before one last score, Kilmer's wife decides not to rat on him because...gasp...she loves him so much.Don't get me wrong--I liked this movie more than I disliked it, but I'm being very hard on it because I feel that Mann didn't take full advantage of the opportunity he had. I feel like he was given the ingredients for a cake, and instead he gave us a cookie. And to add insult to injury, there's only ONE substantial scene between Pacino and DeNiro. Hey, that would've been fine if the movie was 1 hour and 40 minutes long, but the movie is 3 HOURS LONG, and the best Mann could do was give us a 5-MINUTE scene with two of the most legendary actors of our time???There are at least half a dozen writer/directors who could've done the Pacino-DeNiro union better justice than Mann, especially in regard to the writing. (In fact, Mann went the lazy route and simply dusted off an old script he wrote years ago--'LA Takedown'--and updated it. How dare he!!) Mann's script is full of cliches and wooden dialogue. Can you imagine what a more talented writer/director like Tarantino could've done with a Pacino-DeNiro pairing?So once again, I'll say: the movie was good, but not the 'masterpiece' that a lot of people have proclaimed. For me, what makes this movie watchable is not the story, but the performances of the two leads. Some people have said that DeNiro's performance is better than Pacino's, but I think that both performances are equally worthy. Yes, Pacino's acting does get a little weird in a couple of places, but his character was the harder character to portray. Actors rarely admit this, but playing the Villain is easier than playing the Good Guy. Good Guys are boring...unless you try to give them texture and added dimensions to make them just as eye-catching as the Villains.All I can do at this point is hope that Pacino and DeNiro agree to act together again in another, better movie.",Null,0,1,1 June 2002
