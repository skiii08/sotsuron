Hereditary," Hmmmmm
","I've seen the movie twice. The first time it was sometime preferable to plucking hairs. The second, I saw more into it than the long intervalled borefest previously encountered. I appreciated Toni Colette for the first time ever in 18 movies. The rest, akin to dismal. I see that horror has taken a turn from frights to a disturbing circumstance that may happen in the house next door.I enjoy that. Unfortunately having next to zero plot with so much well done cinematography it stood on one foot, fighting off excitement with 'darkness and anticipation'. The fight being concluded with a shrug, delivered by boredom, and the referee, 'Slapdash Quickplot', called it quits with a quick ending to an otherwise fruitless film. Toni Collette did well until now was not a fan. On a scale of one to ten I rate it a 'meh'.",6,3,4,6 November 2019
