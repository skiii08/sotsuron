Child 44," Don't expect an intense crime thriller here.
","I went to watch this knowing Tom Hardy is well capable of pulling a film through on his own regardless of the story, also it's the middle of April and there's nothing else on.The film isn't bad, but it doesn't exactly get the juices flowing with excitement and intrigue around every corner but is definitely worth a watch over the latest instalment of Britain's Got Talent or whatever other series people will be telling me about on Monday morning.It has some very convenient plot moments that just seem to happen to explain the story as obviously as possible, with no real twists in the story at all. There's never a guessing game of 'who the bad guy is' and you pretty much know who is on which side from the beginning which hurts the film a little.The film could have been made much better but it's still overall a decent watch for a slow Sunday afternoon.",6,15,33,19 April 2015
