Hereditary," Slow Burn Drama With Disappointing Ending
","The good: acting is excellent, cinematography is interesting, story elements that are set in reality (grief, family issues, etc.) are well done The bad: occult side of story at first interesting, but then steadily becomes cheesy until a laughable endingThis film is not scary, besides a couple of jump scares, nor is it anything that hasn't been done before. Worth a watch on cable or Netflix, but I wouldn't run out and pay theater prices for it. Props to Toni Collette and the young man who played her son. They were tasked with some emotional heavy lifting which I feel they both did an excellent job executing.",5,3,6,24 July 2018
