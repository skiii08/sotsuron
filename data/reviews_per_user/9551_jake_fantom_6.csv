10 Cloverfield Lane," Budget: $30
","I'm only posting this review as a counter to the dozens of glowing critiques in IMDb, and in the hopes of saving at least a soul or two from the unbearable agony of suffering through this waste of time and talent as I did based on the opinions of reviewers who wouldn't know a good movie if it bit them on the behind. If you have any intentions of actually watching this train wreck, I suggest you stop reading this review now: MAJOR SPOILER ALERTS lie ahead. For starters, this has got to be one of the all-time lowest-budget films ever attempted. 95% of the movie is filmed in a bunker with 3 actors. And the big question that keeps viewers watching is: is John Goodman simply a delusional serial killer who kidnaps women and imprisons them in his bunker, or have aliens really attacked our planet? And guess what? It's both! You get two for the price of one! A deranged serial killer movie, and a slimy space alien with tentacles movie! What could be better? Actually, two hours in the dentist's chair would be better. Neither of these plot lines make a grain of sense — especially when the resourceful heroine manages not only to escape John Goodman's clutches, but also to defeat a pack of the local aliens despite their scary flying saucer and green poison gas. To be fair, the space alien portion of the film only lasts about ten minutes, and it is shot in almost total darkness, the better to disguise the fact that the alien is the same rubber octopus that Bela Lugosi wrestled in Bride of the Monster. Don't say you haven't been warned.",1,9,21,18 May 2016
John Wick," Watchable shooter
","If you're 13 or 14 years old and you absolutely adore violent video games, get your mom to take you to this picture and you will be in awesomeness heaven. If you're not, you'll probably want to steer clear of this ultra-violent and essentially nonsensical hit man revenge shoot-em-up. The body count surpasses most war movies — I lost count after the first 50 heavies had been dispatched in gorgeous squibs of blood and gore. The film requires a good deal of suspension of disbelief — for instance, there's a special hotel where hit men and women stay, paying in Krugerrands. There's also an exclusive club for hit men and women, where they can dance the night away as long as they respect the rules about not carrying out contracts on the premises. Keanu Reeves is better than usual as John Wick, the retired hit man who gets dragged back in, although i can't help feeling there is something sick about glorifying the talents of a hired killer. And there is a supporting cast of always-good character actors, including Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane, who add some grit and texture to what is otherwise a glossy and superficial fantasy of balletic violence. But getting back to the attractions for teen video gamers — there are some really cool cars in this movie too, and Keanu does this majorly cool thing where he drives real crazy and shoots people and runs them over. What a cool guy!",4,1,8,27 January 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Approach with low expectations
","A perfect combination of cheesy CGI, an incomprehensible plot, scene after scene of unconvincing combat with aliens (basically, heaps of angry steel cable), and of course, Tom Cruise's patented style of wooden acting, make this one of the most boring action films you will ever see. After falling asleep not once but twice during explosion-filled battle scenes, I gave up on this pointless hodge-podge of witless and derivative sci-fi set pieces. It occurs to me now that the high ratings on IMDb may have tricked me into setting my expectations too high. So please approach this with low expectations. It would also be helpful if you could transform yourself into a 14-year-old to best experience this feast of mediocrity. I'm only giving it two stars instead of one because Tom starts out as a coward in this one, which is a tad more satisfying than his usual grand heroics. (His only good roles have been as villains).",2,12,37,16 September 2014
Whiplash," Moronic, pointless, and full of crap
","If you are a believer in the clichéd notion that success can only come from obsessive dedication to the exclusion of all normal human interaction, coupled with mountains of degradation, suffering, humiliation, and physical torture, you will absolutely adore this worthless pile of clichés, stereotypes, and bankrupt cinematic ideas. The story of a young jazz drummer who is brutalized by a sadistic teacher in the interests of spurring him to greatness is one of the most repulsive exercises in sheer idiocy ever committed to the screen. I watched and watched, waiting for some valid point to emerge from scenes of torment, bleeding hands, broken relationships, hideous nastiness and all the rest, but in the end, all we get is a whopping nonsensical cliché that only a fool could buy into. J.K. Simmons (the psychologist from Law and Order) does a credible job as the sadistic teacher, but honestly, no one could do much with a part this stereotypical... he couldn't have been more villainous unless he had a mustache to twirl. And the rest of the cast doesn't do any better with their phony baloney parts. Folks, if you don't have a credible story based in some form of recognizable and believable reality, nothing else matters. The fact that this one gets such a high rating on IMDb proves that HL Mencken was right: No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.",1,135,260,26 January 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Brilliant screwball comedy in the grand tradition
","This is easily one of the Coen brothers' best films, but there's a catch — you must have an understanding of American cinema and history to appreciate it. Those reviewers who have dismissed it simply don't get it, and it's hard to blame them. Without some kind of background in movies of the 30s, 40s, and 50s, you don't really have the reference points to appreciate what the Coen brothers have accomplished here. Suffice it to say, if you are a true movie lover and fan of Hollywood in its heyday, you will love this picture. It is probably the funniest of all the Coen brothers' films, with unbelievably great comedic performances by Brolin, Clooney, Johansson, Fiennes, Tatum, Swinton, McDormand, Hill and literally all the rest of the cast. There is not a bad performance in this movie. In fact, it is worth seeing just for the cameos. It is also one of the most cinematically gorgeous films ever shot, with amazing recreations (send-ups, really) of old Hollywood production numbers. Thanks to the benighted reviewers, I saw this in an absolutely empty theater, projected in glorious 4K. If you can still catch it while it's in the theaters, I urge you to run out and do so. It is a truly wonderful film.",10,1,8,8 March 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," As bad as you will see this or any other year
","If you like your emperors buck naked, this turgid, fraudulent piece of dreck should be right up your alley. Black comedy? Then how come there's not so much as a chuckle, not even a wan smile, in the entire dismal mess? Art film? If this is art, true artists like Welles and Bunuel are spinning in their graves. A sheer unmitigated waste of time. I had to force myself to sit through the entire fiasco — why? Because I was determined to see it through to the end in case some brilliant scene or plot development might justify the critical praise and Academy Awards. No such luck — what you see in the first five excruciating minutes is what you get. It's like that moment in an old 70s' porno film when you realize that that pimply derrière is what you are going to be staring at for the next two hours. I actually think this is worth seeing just to prove to yourself how worthless critical reviews (and reviewers) are, and what an absolute joke the Academy Awards are. If a film has a gamy whiff of artistic pretension, these self-appointed arbiters of cinematic taste are terrified of panning it. In actual fact, they have no idea if it's art or total crap, but they don't want to appear ignorant. Well folks, rest assured, this one if total crap. As other reviewers have pointed out here, in addition to everything else, the film is a colossal waste of some very talented actors, Michael Keaton not the least of them. I am a huge Keaton fan and have been since Night Shift, but even a brilliant actor like Keaton could not save this deplorable piffle. Señor Alejandro González Iñárritu, you, sir, are an absolute fraud.",1,50,106,26 February 2015
