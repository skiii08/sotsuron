Miracle," Excellent Movie
","Miracle is an excellent movie about the greatest moment in sports history. You have to understand the game of hockey to really appreciate this movie. I believe why more people did not see Miracle is because they do not understand the game of hockey or choose not to understand it. The acting was top-notch in Miracle, especially Kurt Russell. He did a great job as Herb Brooks. I have always been a Kurt Russell, but I believe this was his best part. If you haven't seen this movie, I encourage you to go see it, you will witness something great. I do wish Herb Brooks could have been alive to see this movie, but remember he was a part of the real thing. Overall, I give this movie a 10.",10,1,1,16 November 2006
