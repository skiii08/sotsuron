Resident Evil: Afterlife," The best part from all series!!! Gallant!!!
","Such for me happens for the first time, the fourth part of a film has appeared better three previous together taken. It is the second of my favorit games (the first Silent Hill) and on it I was in earnest about films, though they not especially pleased me, before games by it was very far. All three parts of a film are good, but in them always something yes lacked and consequently they were on firm «4/5». And here the fourth part has surpassed all my expectations, it has appeared not worse the first games of a series (it already not that resident that earlier, have transformed it into a simple and banal action which too is quite good, but it already other kind of game).I would tell that time on a film now has come to make game and it it would appear better 4 and 5 parts of games. The plot, atmosphere and music underneath are ingenious. The actor's structure is magnificent, it was very pleasant to see in Ventvort Miller's film (the actor of my favorit serial 'Prison Break'), also has pleased a set of the best characters of a series of games, Albert Vesker was on the ball, it was such as it have shown in game Code Veronica, Kler and Chris Redfildy are remarkable. It was shaking, I as though have returned to the childhood and have felt that pleasant chill which felt playing old and kind first three parts plus Veronica on PS 2. A spoiler: the character from my favorit game of Sajlent Hill, has been successfully borrowed by Piramidhead, here it has been a little modified, but similarity was obvious also I was glad it to see (when thus that or is borrowed, it only on advantage), a remarkable course and bravo to Paul W.S. Anderson!!! We wait continuation, very much I hope that it will be in style of the fourth part.",10,4,10,10 October 2010
