Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident Evil: of Zombies and Franchise Milking
","That is what the Resident Evil franchise appears to be down to after the second installment. This last one steers in that direction even more than its predecessor, Extinction. That third movie is where RE jumped the shark; where it showed that it had nothing more to say or show. Afterlife just stresses that even further and makes it clear that what the producers are after is just trying to squeeze the last bucks out of a withering copyright instead of trying to revitalize and relaunch it. All that which appears in this movie feels old, overused, clichéd and, utterly predictable: the apocalypse theme; the cloning theme; the recycled bad guy; the same old zombie-Dobermans; the ludicrous resourcefulness and perseverance of the most infamous Umbrella corp.; the bad/half-bad turn-coating character; the wealth of irrelevant 'secondary' (more like nth-ary) characters; the matrix-like bullet time effects; etc. Of course all those features wouldn't be such a grave issue if they actually contributed to the telling of an interesting and original story, but sadly this is not the case with RE4. I mean, I watched the entire movie and had not one single scare... just long sequences of boring and silly dialogs or boring and 'spectacular' action scenes of the kind that became old shortly after it was first introduced by the Matrix, more than a decade ago. What's more, I think that what really kills the mood is the total unlikeliness and absence of purpose that permeates the whole movie. Alice's clones just get slaughtered by the hundred while Alice herself flies around alone over the US and Canada looking for a bunch of survivors from the previous movie... and lo and behold!, not only does she find (some random) survivors, but none other than the brother of one of the characters from the previous movie that she just saved somewhere else... Oh boy, if that's not a lucky coincidence... Then there's the usual decimation of the survivors proper of every 'survival horror', but rendered in an extremely uninteresting and trivial way, then the final battle with the 'end level boss', that is also very forgettable. The ending also suggests there's a chance a fifth Resident Evil will be shot... and, although I loved the first two, I hope the writers/director either get their act together or let it rest with a clean shot to the head.Acting ranges from average to mildly crappy: Milla Jovovich seems to be trapped in a role that has become a caricature of the original Alice, the 'co-stars' Miller and Larter don't shine at all, and Wesker's blank facial expression makes him look more like a moving piece of furniture than a dangerous mutant evil bad-ass. The wealth of cool CG effects and OK cinematography cannot, IMO, make up for all those flaws, and that's why I think this movie deserves a 5/10 (or something less).",5,3,10,16 September 2010
The Expendables," This movie is... expendable.
","I believe that the most notable characteristic of this movie can be summarized by the poster on the left: a list of 'big' names and known faces, all mixed up together regardless of their actual role and its (ir)relevance to the 'story'. To be more clear, Willis plays an insignificant cameo of some minutes, Rourke has a very minor role, 'Stone Cold' has a minor role AND is a 'bad guy', almost same thing for Lundgren, etc, etc. You could also see this as an example of deceptive advertising, in a sense: throwing in big names to have some people say 'wow! what a cast! I gotta watch this!'. Of course, having big names in a movie would be a good thing, if only the actors that bear those names were given a meaningful role and the chance(/ability?) to play it. Of all the actors cited in that list, only Stallone, Statham an (oddly enough) Li play what one might call 'main' roles, and the first two are the ones who actually have some lines of dialog too. Yes, this is an action movie, not a drama, but I don't believe this can be a justification for ridiculously ill developed plot and characters (e.g. the 'apex' of character development this movie reaches is well exemplified by two ludicrously sketchy sequences that involve Statham and Mrs. Carpenter), and for fast paced action that sadly doesn't 'connect' in order to form a linear and accomplished plot sequence. How are Stallone and 'his squad' organized? Who are they, and what's their background? What's the deal with the bad guys? What are they doing? Who the hell is Willis supposed to be and why/how does he contract these guys? And so on, and on. (Incidentally, the scene with Willis and *won't spoil this 'surprise'* is for some reason one of the most self-indulging and 'least-funny-while-trying-too-hard-to-be' I've seen recently)The movie does almost nothing in order to create a sense of 'perspective' and purpose to help the viewer relate to what's going on and feel intrigued by it. It's all about martial arts, weapons and explosions, but if this is all one is entitled to expect from an action movie, then, hell, we already have dozens of Seagal and Van Damme's flicks out there that do exactly the same things without all the 'glittering stars' Stallone could draw upon.As the saying goes: All that glitters...6/10",6,1,7,1 September 2010
Insidious," INSIDIOUSly crappy
","I read several comments posted here, of grown up men with wife and kids who went on and on about how scary this movie was and how it almost made them pi-, I mean, wet their pants or scream like little girls. So, long story short, I was eager to watch this one, especially because a movie with this budget that succeeds where so many million-dollar-blockbusters fail would have been epic and praiseworthy as a feat in itself.The movie is not so bad for the first half or so, during which it behaves like an 'average' psychological-horror, that is to say, a movie that works solely on atmosphere coupled with a good photography, music and sound effects to create a sense of tension and/or fear; and it does that relatively well, despite being rather slow paced, uneventful and based on a weak plot. So, to wrap it up: no gore, no special effects, and I'd say, no plot twists.So far it would have been a decent movie (like, 6/10) with some scares (very few) but also pretty boring overall. Fact is that the second part of the movie is actually quite lame, starting from the unnecessary 'comic relief' of the nerdy 'paranormal investigators' and continuing with the ridiculous 'monsters'/spirits, the related paranormal mumbo-jumbo (this time involuntarily comic, I guess) and the laughable 'quest' to save the possessed child.The general acting level left me very unimpressed, and I think that plot, pace, visual effects and ending also leave much to be desired.However, I keep seeing a lot of 1/10 or 9-10/10 flying around these days on here, which I believe to be extremely unbalanced and almost always undeserved. My rating for this movie is 5/10: surely more than watchable (if you like this kind of 'soft horror', that is), but surely not worthy of all the hype surrounding it, and thus deceiving, or better, insidiously crappy.",5,0,4,29 October 2011
A Quiet Place," Boring, dull, not scary
","First off, this isn't a horror... It's basically a thriller (only with 'monsters') but IMO rather weak at that too. I didn't really find it suspenseful or scary in the least.The whole story is quite boring, pointless, uneventful and lacking development, like its characters. It almost felt like watching a still picture for one hour and a half. On top of that, there are a number of logical fallacies and pitfalls (that others have mentioned in their reviews) that break the suspension of disbelief, making the whole experience even less believable and enjoyable and the characters much less realistic and relatable.At any rate, production value is good and acting as well, but those alone are definitely not enough to save the movie.It was frankly quite surprising to see the rating it currently enjoys here (8/10)...",5,2,3,28 May 2018
Clash of the Titans," In one word? BO-RING!
","And if an action movie is boring, it simply is a failure. Where to begin? This movie is a mass of sloppy clichés: the righteous hero; the quest for revenge; the disposable secondary characters who happily die helping him; the stereotyped evil, infamous and power thirsty nemesis; the happily ever after finale; and so forth. The fact that half of the actors speak British English and the other half American English didn't help much in making their Greek mythological characters particularly credible (to my ears at least). Furthermore, those characters are simply too plain and shabby: no depth, no attitude, bare and completely forgettable (every single one of them). The action scenes are ill conceived and even worse executed. The direction wasn't able to give a sense of continuity and seamless and gradual flowing to the story: it feels almost like a series of separate episodes (badly) glued together (which is also reflected by the cinematography: bleak and dark settings, then sunny and idyllic ones...). The CG is there and is not so bad in itself, but it doesn't help at all: almost feels like out of place and unnecessary.I was actually falling asleep while watching this... One of the worst movies I've watched in the last few months: don't bother with it. 4.5/10",4,6,8,3 July 2010
Midsommar," 165 Minutes of Empty Artsy Weirdness
","I had read good things about it, and curiosity kept me going until the very end, but then it felt like I spent 165 minutes watching A Space Odyssey's monkeys crushing bones (minus the metaphor)...In other words: nicely shot, but hollow, and not scary or suspenseful in the least (since it was supposed to be horror movie, right?). Story and plot are basically non-existent, scares and thrills are simply not there, the pace is slow, characters are undeveloped mono-dimensional cardboard figures... As mentioned before, it's visually very good and imaginative, but that's not nearly enough.4/4.5 - A fail, IMHO. Definitely skippable and forgettable, unless you're just looking for something 'different'.",4,4,7,5 November 2019
The Fountain," All ye behold: the psychedelic immortal Buddhist Mayan monk-garden(er), Wolverine.
","OK, so, this movie is ALL about visual and conceptual metaphors, so every single person will come up with their own interpretation of them. And that is basically all the story there is to this movie.Aside for that, I must say I was about to stop watching at about minutes 15 and 30. I was very annoyed by the continuous story-switching (there are 3 different 'realities' alternating, and they don't follow a linear chronological order). I don't like flashbacks, and this movie is like a huge (metaphoric) flashback at the nth power. But since I thought I could waste another hour watching, I did. However, I don't see why this was labeled as Sci-Fi: it is NOT (maybe LS-Di).On the bright side, I must say Wolverine delivers a very neat and convincing performance (the fact he doesn't have claws nor hair spikes at the sides of his head helped), and this is even more impressing considering that in order to do that Jackman must have been able to actually understand what the movie was all about and relate to it.The locations (especially the interiors) are quite beautiful, both the CGI and the real ones, same goes for the camera work.There isn't really much to say about the characters... the movie could have even been shot with just Jackman and Weisz and nothing would have really changed (possibly with Jackman all by himself).My personal interpretation is that this movie is an eulogy of acceptance and closure. Peace (enlightenment) can be reached by not brooding over losses, letting go and accept whatever comes. Probably all good and true, but certainly not particularly original, nor 'enlightened'... As for the way the director rendered it, probably he has a predilection for certain substances over others, or he just wanted to show off, or both, who knows/cares?The mark is about 6.5/10 in my book.",7,0,1,21 February 2010
Joker," Disconnect
","In short, this is a decent drama about mental illness that, for some unfathomable reason, plays with the DC universe and the Joker character, although it shouldn't have. This Joker has little to nothing to do with all the previous incarnations we've seen so far, and the whole story kind of falls to pieces once you look away from the main character and consider the bigger picture.Also, as a side note: please stop it with the continuous (although more often than not unwarranted) reboots of entire universes/franchises and 're-geneses' of characters... I can understand the need to remarket a 'product' to make it appealing again to new audiences, tastes and fads, and make more money out of it, but this is becoming ridiculous... (3 totally different Jokers in 10 years...)6.5/7 out of 10 (as a drama/crime story revolving around mental illness)",7,2,3,16 October 2019
