The depiction and mythology of Godzilla both as hero and a monster is gripping, extraordinary and very fascinating.The last few minutes of epic showdown is very interesting, absorbing, artistic, awe-inspiring and very beautifully filmed and shot. The movie illustrates the power of the King of Monsters and the film captures Godzilla in all of its glory. Every time Godzilla is on screen the movie develops into a non stop thrill ride. The movie immerses its audience into the adventures of Godzilla which oozes brilliance in every scene it appears. The film is a visual marvel and brilliant in its conception and execution. The movie also explores the oppositional forces other than Godzilla and captures the essence of fear and visual beauty. The movie breathes life into the characterization of Godzilla and enchants itself with every element. The film is an extraordinary testament in its portrayal of the cultural icon of Godzilla. The movie accomplishes the difficult task of genre based film making.The direction of Gareth Edwards is good especially in regards to visuals and creating Godzilla action sequences. The main and major issue with the film is the very less screen time of Godzilla. This is really a major disappointment, because there is very less Godzilla in the film and Godzilla itself does't get enough screen time in its own film. The Human characters of the film are dull, boring and very underdeveloped. There is no emotional depth and intensity. Another major issue with the film is another major character that is the character of Bryan Cranston, also has a very less screen time. But, its the last superb fifteen minutes of the film that delivers something totally awesome.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others.

Minions," Minions is good fun time Movie, especially for kids with some good aspects and elements for adult and family audiences too.
","Minions: Movie Review.Minions is an enjoyable entertaining animation movie for kids as well as for adults too, with its funny comedy scenes it will keep making adults laugh and smile too. 3D Aspect of the Minions Movie is great and and Animation is fantastic. The characterization of Minions are excellent and Visual Effects (CGI, VFX) are brilliant. The movie looks very good visually. I watched the movie in 3D and one can literally feel all the little Minions jumping out of the screen.The performance of Pierre Coffin (as the Minions), is must watch and it is positive point of the movie. Its entertaining and worth watching. Minions is directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda. The directors have done a satisfactory jobs in creating a good prequel/spin off Minions Movie. Their creative vision of crafting those awesome and amazing little Minions is amazing. The performances are good. Pierre Coffin as the Minions is great. The character of Sandra Bullock as Scarlett Overkill is OK, but not up too the mark, somehow it misses the perfection mark. Michael Keaton and Geoffrey Rush as supporting characters were OK, and the rest of the cast characters were good but sidelined.Minions has lots of flaws too. The story plot structure is bad, the script and screenplay seems to be underwhelming at certain times and there is no strong support to the movie from the story point of view. There are lots of unnecessary and underdeveloped characters, especially the character of Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) is very under utilized and does not feel too good. The story plot line is somewhat weak, its like anything is happening anytime without any proper effect.Minions are delight to watch. I enjoyed the movie, its a good cinema time for your kids and maybe for you too.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others.

Furious 7," Furious 7 is Fun, Entertaining, Action- Packed Explosive Thrill ride.
","Furious 7: Movie Review.Furious 7 is a film with little bit taste and touch of Humor and it is also sad and emotional too at the same time. Some Action Sequences are good and well executed. James Wan Direction is good.The fight sequences of the movie are well directed as well as well performed. The performances are enjoyable. Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Kurt Russel, along with rest of the cast are amazing in their respective characters. Story is not so great but visually its thrilling till the end. As for Paul Walker and his performance, he is charming as ever. It makes me sad and emotional that I have watched a last performance by him. It makes me emotional to say that this film marks the final appearance of one of my most favorite character of this series, Paul Walker. His performance in the movie is above all and its emotionally touching. The Tribute and Honor to him at the end of the movie is very emotional and touching and very well directed to say goodbye and farewell to one of the legendary character of the Furious series- Paul Walker- Brain O' Connor.Fast and Furious will Never going to be the same.--For Paul---Thank you Paul Walker for Entertaining Me. You Will be always in my heart and in my memories. You will always going to be one of my most favorite character in Fast and Furious films for all time. Furious 7 is the movie which always going to be close to my heart because of Paul Walker.All over, Furious 7 is a good movie.
