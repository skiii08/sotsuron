The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Breaking Yawn
",I cannot even begin to tell you the high hopes I had for this installment in a series that has not really grabbed me and made me even want to pick up the books when I heard Bill Condon was directing because I am on of his biggest fans. You could have just stabbed my eyes to keep me awake this yawner was the worst in the series and while I cannot even give an average score to any of them this one just killed it for me nail in the coffin its boring. The best scene and I kid you not is the wedding which was staged so beautifully but how much more of this tripe am I going to endure as a horror fan. This movie makes some SyFy Saturday movies look like masterpieces. Really Bill Condon can do much better and since I have never read the books was this really worth the budget. I won't even go into the lifeless performances or the nearly lethargic pace. Jacob imprinting on an infant really??? I apologize for all those misguided kids waiting in lines to see this marathon of yawn. I know there is potential there to tell a compelling Story at least the last two movies had moments that kept me interested in the story see where it goes now I just don't care.,2,5,6,26 February 2012
It," Solid Scary Creepy Comedy Drama its Perfect
","As a fan of the original mini series and having read the book years ago I can tell you this movie is a Perfect Adaptation of the first half. The chemistry of the young cast goes a long way to making us care about them, they give strong performances. Skarsgard embodies a completely different and creepier scarier Pennywise that will turn your hair white. I was screaming and jumping and freaking out and I loved every minute of it best King adaptation in ages. Best part you can still watch the original and appreciate it they are different takes on the same story.",10,1,3,7 September 2019
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Don't trust the Reviews Here it's Good
","I have to say prior to leaving for the theatre to see Wolverine I checked IMDb as I often do and most the reviewers are dead wrong. Everyone thinks they could make a better movie couch critics, hasn't anyone just gone to the movies to get a good evening of fun and thrills do we all have to dissect every aspect. I love movies and can be very critical of them especially those in a series that take my intelligence and the very mythos already established for granted. This movie doesn't do that it gives a qualified back story and still manages to align itself with the other movies in the series. BTW its no over produced by any Hollywood standard to say that about this movie would be to say that about Harry Potter, Transformers etc. Liev Shrieber is excellent and Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. I hate when people give away to much so I won't do that suffice to say seeing Gambit realized was a treat as a big fan of the Xmen comic and while the fusion of metal to Wovlerines body was quite tame in comparison to the comic version of the story its OK after all this is a movie it can't be the same. My partner in crime at this movie is not a big fan of action but has seen all the Xmen movies his comment at the end was 'this was much better than Xmen III'...I may not be able to say the same thing but just goes to show you see it for yourself you won't feel like you wasted your money...you may even be glad you saw it on the Big Screen. Good acting, Good direction, well paced while not being frantic or slow, good special FX, an overall entertaining chapter in the Xmen story.",8,3,7,6 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," It's not All there but Worth Seeing
","I wanna start with the positives, Bale as usual is very intense and gives us the John Connor you would expect, MCG delivers in the special FX department along with a few bits of humor and a smidge of suspense, Anton Yelchin is an Actor people should be keeping an eye on he is a blossoming Talent. Now the bad little to no character development, a script that while it pays homage to the previous films has little else to offer many scenes that should have had exciting suspenseful build up just splash across the screen in Grand Big Budget Spectacle and that is the films weakness. All the films relied on good storytelling, sadly when I came home I rewatched the previous films, While the original Terminator was a low budget film Cameron incorporated suspense, character, and connected with the audience you cared about Kyle & Sarah. T2 expanded in both directions with solid character development, explosive visual FX, innovative approaches, and progressed the storyline moving it forward, with intensity, drama,even humor. T3 while weaker than the two movies before it still managed to deliver in style, suspense, yes Nick Stahl was a wimpy John Connor with that aside, Claire Danes was great and Arnold older now still managed to deliver, Christiana Loekane was awesome, with a weak script Jonathan Mostow still managed to delivery a satisfactory movie and this is my where things get weird can u believe I liked this one better than Salvation. I remember not really thinking that much of T3 but now it stands above the latest release. I sure hope Jane Alexander has more to do in the next installment what a waste of talent, and thats what I think of Terminator Salvation what a missed opportunity for true greatness.",7,2,3,8 June 2009
Quantum of Solace," Incredibly Fantastic Riveting Bonafide Bond A 10
","I don't wanna give anything away. This is the best Bond I have ever seen. I nearly cried between, cringing, holding my popcorn steady as I held on to my seat. Could it be that this Bond is not just any 007 but that he is human too. I have never felt like I did in any Bond movie and I have seen them all. Casino Royale was good even though a bit slow and long at times but sandwich that one with this one and wow...DID I SAY WOW!!!!! Yes I did. Make sure to re-watch the DVD expanded version to truly appreciate this one there are story threads you will want to see again prior to seeing this one, I am watching it now because had I known what a direct sequel this was I would have done so last night. OMG, this is the Bond that never was, its not just Daniel Craig, its the whole enchilada, from the intricate script, layered drama, incredible never before seen action sequences, Dame Judi Dench has never been better as M, not one character is taken for granted in anyway, every slight character has some degree of depth even those that manage less than 5 minutes of screen time. You will not believe nor did you know that all your life and how many Bond movies before it that you've been waiting for this the one and only BONAFIDE BOND MOVIE EVER. I love you Sean Connery, Peirce Bronan but you could not have made this Bond alone it takes a village.",10,6,14,15 November 2008
Alien vs. Predator," I like this movie because it closes the gap between predator and aliens
","In order to truly appreciate this film see Predator I & II, then AVP and go on to the Aliens films. Sounds like a long weekend but this film covers all the hints and mythos created by the Alien films(such as the prior knowledge of the Aliens and Bishops creator/template) and follows the pretext of the Predator films that they had been coming here for years even centuries. Lets get to what I like about this movie, fast paced, good special effects, better than average writing, and Paul Anderson directing,but this film should have been R rated with some better 'murder,death,kill footage....yes carnage'. The lead actors give credible performances, while the director creates suspense, and cleaver fight sequences that get you into the action...Aliens it's not but good it is.",8,2,4,24 May 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Eagles Soar, Dwarfs Sing, and Peter Jackson has the one Ring
","I will start with the bad, many reviews have discussed this at length, in truth the beginning could have used a bit of tightening, however when the Dwarfs began to sing the folk songs of old, I grinned from ear to ear yes its in the books. Peter Jackson embraces the technological changes since he first lensed the ring Trilogy and lets be honest when he made them back in 2000-2001 they were state of the art of film technology and so to is the Unexpected Journey. He also creates links from the Hobbit to the Ring Trilogy something I really did like after all it is a prequel to the Movies and while no movie is ever as in depth as the book their are strong reasons to create these histories of the characters, in fact Tolkien did much the same writing other tales, along with various notes his son published later and Tolkien himself referred to as his Legendarium. I also think its important to remind ourselves this story was originally published in 1936, with the Ring Trilogy published 1954-55. Whats astonishing to me is how well Peter Jackson relates to these stories along with his creative writing team Fran Walsh and Phillipe Boyens, its nearly impossible to imagine any other team bringing these books to the screen. What I so loved in this first installment was the things I found missing in the original three movies and thats the animals the over-sized rabbits, the spiders, the Eagles I actually teared up seeing them it was as if someone had peered into my imagination and stolen my vision. I will close with the good, CGI was done well don't listen to the haters, Gollum is wicked, visually stunning presentation, exciting and well paced 2nd half of the movie were it not for the pacing in the first 40 minutes I might have given it a 10 but I deducted for it, the acting was good and eventually Bilbo Baggins Lives this first installment is about Courage. Go See it one tiny side note haha I played Smaug in the play many years ago in high school.",8,5,13,17 December 2012
The Mist," Great Horror, Complex Characters, Chills, Scares & Dark Ending
","I have read some of the reviews and I don't understand what some people didn't get and why they didn't like the way Mrs. Carmody was portrayed. This is based on a short story from way back in King's career, the resulting script is faithful to the way King writes his characters, the pacing was good, the inter-personal drama is well acted & written, Frank Darabont directs with real fervor, creating a modern horror monster movie, the ending would and probably did go over very well in Europe, it's the type of ending that usually gets changed for American audiences thankfully it was not. Many people here just can't take a movie for what it is entertainment, and in this movies case a parallel between monstrous behavior and real monsters. Simply put I loved it have now watched it 6 times on DVD every time I catch some nuance I missed. King adaptations benefit from good character development and this one has it in spades.",10,1,3,8 May 2008
No Man's Land," Fantastic, Scary, Original, Amazing, FrightFest
","I won't spoil anything. I just found this on Fearnet and watched it streaming the last night. I never heard of this movie and I cannot tell you how frightening, gory, and good this movie is coming from a dyed in the wool 45yr old horror SF veteran that is a compliment. What some creative filmmakers can do on a meager budget is amazing when you consider all the hogwash that comes out of Hollywood with big stars and budgets to find this gem on a free viewing via the internet...viva live streaming. This movie is the very reason I built a PC for my living room ....totally awesome. Solid direction, very good script, very good performances from all actors, fantastic special f/x absolutely a must see...watching this reminded me of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead I saw it at a midnight screening and couldn't sleep all night ...that is the effect this No Mans Land had on me...see it to believe it for free on fear-net while it's still showing.",10,0,2,24 April 2009
X-Men: Apocalypse," WOW!!! X-Men Perfection
",Wow!!! What writer Chris Claremont did for the Xmen comic in the 80's Director Writer Brian Singer is doing for the Xmen film franchise this movie brings us full circle even through the altered time line after Days of Future Past back to the first Xmen film only now that the time line was altered do we see the true repercussion. That's saying a lot people get twisted with timeline alterations but this connects things from all the movies and of course from First Class to Apocalypse. More than that it gives more foundation to what we see when Logan returns to the mansion after Future Past to find Phoenix and Cyclops alive and more than that go back to the first film and remember Xavier knew things about Logan. When timelines are altered somethings stay the same but play out differently like Mystique working in the Danger Room make note of the Sentinels from the first movie to the newest perfect example of timeline alterations yet stay the same. Brian Singer is a Genius. OH Yeah go see it omg its so good critics be damned Long Live the Phoenix.,10,7,17,27 May 2016
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," WOW!!! Can You Say Sequel Can You Say Thumbs Up
","This is the best sequel I have seen all so far this summer, takes up right were first left off. Focuses on Mr. Fantastic, & Sue, where as the first focused on Viktor, Johnny & The Thing (by the way buy the extended version of first film before going out to see the sequel not that it's relative but it's a better movie with just a few added scenes, very cool) Norrin Radd was better than I expected, special FX top notch, just enough action, FX, and character development kept the movie moving at a nice pace with a slightly slow start which actually helps the film build in excitement. The return of Doom was well handled even if they played up the clichéd bad guy trusted by army military nuts over intelligent non-aggressive typical scenario it plays well in the movie and Reed grows some gonads in a very funny tet-a-tet with a Colonel who learns to late he should have listened.I loved it and can't wait for the next one...a perfect tweener for a trilogy.",7,3,7,27 June 2007
Thor," Asgard Come To Life
","Its been a few years since I picked up a Thor Comic but I'm more than familiar with his background and stories having read many Marvel Comics and Avengers was one of them with the occasional story arc in Thor. I thought this movie was better than I could have ever expected more than that my partner who never read a comic beyond say Superman was totally into it and thought it was great. When I heard Kenneth Branagh was directing again my thoughts were two fold who better to handle the ins and outs of Asgard and Odin than a Shakespearean Actor/Director. Then Anthony Hopkins it just kept getting better so my hopes were high by the time it premiered. Engaging special FX, I might even say Brilliant the Rainbow bridge come to life in a way so unexpected the attention to details was to me Amazing and gratifying. Every actor gave it their all above average performances, touches of humor, action a plenty this was the incarnation of a Hero to be remembered. Heck I bought the 3D BluRay it was and is awesome in this format. See it",9,0,0,9 March 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Something was Missing
","The first film had humor, catchy phrasing, and built in suspense...this movie has a tribute scene to Gremlins that is nice, a battle sequence with Optimus that makes buying your ticket worthwhile but then it goes all downhill. I actually got sleepy, felt like the humans were the sidekicks and weren't as well integrated into the story. Lots of big big explosions, special fx sequences, a few touching moments but you just keep feeling something is terribly missing and wrong about the film. The last portion of the film seems to drag on and on making the finale very anti-climatic...this is one of those sequels where you hope they make a third to repair the damage done by the second film. Ho-hum.",5,7,17,24 June 2009
It Chapter Two," 10 Spectacular Scary and Frightening
",It's hard to top yourself But Andy Muschietti did thanks to a team of filmmakers actors and great makeup FX. He directed deftly and made Chapter 2 so different from the first and it should be they are grown ups now. We screamed we laughed we jumped I'm 56 yrs old my niece is 40 we loved it. Don't listen to the bad reviews it moves fast for the length and after all its a huge book to bring to the screen. We did watch Chapter 1 just before heading to the theater so for us it was nearly 6 hrs long with a driving and snack bar intermission as we got to our seats.,10,22,42,7 September 2019
