Skyfall," I loved it; it had its flaws and bad connections but was a brilliant milestone film to mark 50 years of Bond!
","8/10 My first review, so don't expect it to be journalism/critic level! See the full review at: http://miloponsford.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/skyfall-2012.htmlI loved Skyfall. I thought it was a brilliant milestone for Bond's 50th anniversary and although it had its flaws and some failed connections, it was beautifully shot, full of action and humorous as always! Nice one, Mendes.There was quite a lot of obvious marketing in Skyfall which disappointed me as the producers are only doing it for the extra money. The last thing I want to see in a fictional film is big logos and brands that we see in a consumer's every-day culture. However, on a more positive note, there were no Apple products! I was so pleased at this; I hate Apple. Another thing I picked up on in Skyfall was how similar it is to classic Bond films from the 60s and 70s. I thought this was a great thing to do as Skyfall marks the 50th anniversary of James Bond and revives some of the moments from old Bond films.Sorry, these were just a couple of small paragraphs from my review as a kind-of taster.

Life of Pi," Ang Lee has created a masterpiece in the world of cinema and this film will long be a very-memorable film due to the breathtaking cinematography and beautiful scenery.
","Read my full review (thoughts on the film, what I liked about it, the plot etc.) at: http://miloponsford.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/kill-list-2011.html...Normally I don't like 3-D films; I hate the cheap, uncomfortable glasses, I hate how you have to look directly at the center of the screen all the time, and they make me feel dizzy. However, the visually-stunning masterpiece that was up on the screen completely took me away and I was completely engaged with the bright colours and amazing imagery. I've heard it's amazing in 2-D, though, and I'm sure it is. There aren't really any exclusive 3-D scenes (such as subjects coming towards the camera), but there is so much more depth in 3-D films, which really brings out how amazing the cinematography was. The composition in every scenic shot was brilliant, and there were some really-amazing scenes and random events that occur with Pi out at sea. The book challenges the idea of reliability, as the imagery could be made-up due to Pi loosing his mind when he's at sea, but we see this vivid imagery ourselves which makes us lean towards the crazier story about the animals on the boat, not the people......I first read the book, Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, in 2009. I also read it in 2011. I've always loved the book as it too has very powerful imagery (especially for a book), and I was hoping that the film wouldn't let down the book like most film-adaptations seem to do these days. I really wasn't expecting Ang Lee to direct it well as his previous films have been nothing like Life of Pi. However, the film was exactly like the book (besides a few little differences), and I was more than satisfied. I'm not sure whether I prefer the original book or the film; they're both brilliant......The story leaves the audience with a question: which of Pi's stories is the truth? I believe the second story to be true. I would like the first story to be true, with it's incredible sequence of random events that haven't been experienced or discovered, but it's unlikely. Why? Because Pi was stranded for a very long time and after seeing nothing but sea and having a bad diet, lack of sleep and suffering from the heat and the pressure he faces, he probably went crazy. We see how exhausted he is when he arrives on the shores of Mexico; he cries and cries until he is in hospital. Also, the island has never been discovered and there is no evidence of any of the animals or events that happened. I also struggle to see how a young man survives that long at sea on a raft with a very hungry Benga tiger, even if he trained it; as Pi's father says earlier on in the story, 'you think tiger is your friend, he is an animal, not a playmate'. The whole movie is about knowledge versus faith; Pi questions and tries different religions and throughout the film these beliefs are questioned with knowledge. What the audience has to decide is whether or not they believe in knowledge of faith, just like Pi did earlier on. I believe in knowledge......In conclusion, Life of Pi is an absolutely brilliant film. Ang Lee has created a masterpiece in the world of cinema and this film will long be a very-memorable film due to the breathtaking cinematography and beautiful scenery. The film is far from a let down to the book, and in my opinion actually excels. 10/10, because it's exactly like the book, not a typical Hollywood adventure and I honestly can't flaw it.",10,6,12,15 January 2013
Taken 2," I had high expectations and felt really let down. If you loved the first one, don't expect much from this.
","Full review at: http://miloponsford.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/taken-2-review.html (Please see :))It is written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and directed by Olivier Megaton, the writers and directors from the Transporter films with Jason Statham and The Fifth Element with Bruce Willis. With this in mind, I had pretty high expectations in terms of action and explosives and fighting scenes and was looking forward to a thrilling, tense plot. I wanted to be hooked by Neeson's cold vengeance and wanted to be shouting and egging on Neeson to break some bad guy's neck, but left the cinema feeling pretty disappointed.The first thing I would like to critisise is the chemistry between the characters; I felt very little between Bryan (Liam Neeson) and his wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and child, Kim (Maggie Grace). It felt like a poor romantic film and although the characters were trying to look like a struggling family that rely on each other, I couldn't help but sit there in the cinema and think 'BOOORRRRIIINNNG! Come on, Neeson, kill some people already!'. I didn't feel any link between the characters and the audience and didn't feel sympathetic for any of the characters, except one...Murad (Rade Serbedzija), the main enemy! At the end he seemed like a helpless old man who just wanted peace and I felt kinda sorry for him when Neeson bluntly killed him. I wanted to watch Taken 2 to feel no sympathy for the bad guys but I felt the opposite!I also didn't like Bryan's style and method of killing in this film; cold, blunt kills. In Taken, Neeson ruthlessly tortures and murders his victims with a variety of techniques (e.g. electrocution). In Taken 2, however, he simply kills the majority of them with a single bullet or two to the chest which was blunt and boring. He clearly wasn't sympathetic (I've said that word a lot already) for anyone and was too tired to play games and just wanted to get home with his family, so he simply pulled the trigger at anyone that stood in his way (yes; by anyone, I mean policemen, too!)The fighting wasn't great either. In Taken we see a range of hand-to-hand intense combat scenes but in the sequel we only see one or two good ones. They were pretty average, too; nothing like the scenes from the Ip Man films or anything similar! The sounds were dull thuds and there was usually no music, so these fighting scenes were just terribly awkward. I just sat there looking around the screen instead of shouting 'COME ON BRYAN! PUNCH HIS TEETH OUT!'. Ah, yes, the music; was really badly used in some scenes. For example, when a bad guy gets out the car there is lots of high tension music, but all he does is go through a door way and then the film switches to another situation.I also thought it was a bit crazy how his daughter hadn't even passed her driving test yet but was able to drive through tight streets at high speeds and do impressive drifts in a taxi that I could only dream of doing in my Capri! I guess I was paying attention to detail, but it still annoyed me. I think the fact that she hadn't passed her driving test was only added in to build sympathy and acted as another teenage connotation.The plot matched Neeson's style of killing; simple and fast and wanted to be done already. I bet I could sum it up in one sentence; 'Bryan and his wife are captured as revenge for Bryan's killing in Taken, and his daughter releases him so he can get revenge on his victim's avengers, then they can enjoy a soppy, unromantic holiday.' Easy!Did Neeson kick some ass as we were expecting? Well, yeah, I guess...nothing hugely entertaining but he did kill a lot of people. Did Olivier Megaton make a good film? No, not really. I wasn't sure if it was a cheesy romance-thriller or a dull action film. I had high expectations and felt really let down. If you loved the first one, don't expect much from this. Don't get me wrong; I really love Neeson and think he is a great actor, but he's certainly winning no Oscar from this film.4/10",4,2,3,6 December 2012
