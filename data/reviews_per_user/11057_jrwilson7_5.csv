The Avengers," Take note....fan boys CAN make decent films
","Everybody take note! The superhero film genre has just been ramped up a gear or two, in fact, someone has rammed the throttle into overdrive and that someone is Joss Whedon. For those of you who don't know who this man is, he's been around a while, but not as famous as other directors. First and foremost, he is a writer. We have him to thank for films like Toy Story, Titan A.E., Atlantis and Alien Resurrection. He is also the writing and directing genius behind TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Dollhouse and the short lived Firefy (among others) and he is no stranger to directing big action movies. He helmed the Firefly spin off movie, Serenity. But, this is Whedon's first big feature film, it's also his first blockbuster and there is a lot riding on the success of this film.The Avengers is a long time coming. There have been numerous directors attached to it, a number of scripts, and of course, six other films preceding it (I am including the original Hulk). Making it work has been no easy task. Each character has their own successful film franchise (Thor 2 and Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3 are due out in the next two years) with plots, subplots and narratives that have loosely been tied together with short end-of-credits scenes involving Nick Fury and the Avengers Initiative.In the first issue of the comic , the team are assembled to fight Thor's brother Loki who has used his power of illusion to persuade the Hulk onto a part of destruction. Whedon has used these elements as his inspiration to create a strong script and storyline that successfully pulls together some of cinemas biggest personalities (and egos) and not only develops their characters further but broadens their appeal.The story is over the top, but not enough that you find yourself scoffing. The reality is that you need to suspend disbelief when dealing with characters from other worlds, aliens and magic! And considering the source material lends itself to be over the top anyway, the beauty in Whedon's script is that it never once takes itself seriously. (SPOILER) Even when S.H.E.I.L.D.S super-sized aircraft carrier turns into a flying invisible fortress, Nick Fury states, 'Let's dance' as reflectors cover the ships surface much like a mirror-ball, rendering it completely invisible to the naked eye! Over the top? Hell Yes! The first act sees the assembly of the Avengers. The Cap and Bruce Banner are asked to find Loki and the Tesseract he has stolen from Shield. Later Thor and Iron Man join the team with Hawkeye and Black Widow. What works well is that when the four superheroes and superegos come together, each thinks they will save the day, but as their egos compete against one another for attention, the typical alpha-male muchoness comes to the fore, causing disunity and damage – a lot of damage!It is not until part the way through the second act that the team pulls together for the greater good, which is to save humanity from total destruction at the hand of Loki and his alien army.The script is what makes this film and is proof that studios should trust 'fan boys' with comic book adaptions. Whedon has used his extensive knowledge and passion to write a story that is appealing to all audiences while combining what we love from the original films. There are plenty of references to the 'prequels' and the character traits each has developed and bring with them and for the fans, easter egg references to the comics to satiate their appetite. It is film is funny. Very funny. The Hulk almost steals the show (spoiler) when he throws Loki around like a ragdoll during his 'I am a God' speech, but each character gets a few choice lines that will surely become part of our vernacular. At times I thought I was in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, considering the scale and grandeur of the film's final act – the near destruction of New York. Although there are hallmarks to DOTM, Avengers is nothing like it, in fact, Whedon proves he is the better director by piecing together huge battle sequences, action, explosions, while ensuring that each character has plenty of screen time that not only makes sense, but doesn't get lost in the enormity and scale of it all.The production flawlessly merges CGI and live action together, but the 3D conversion leaves little to be desired. Considering the success of Tron Legacy, I am surprised Disney (who owns Marvel) didn't pull out all the stops and have it filmed in 3D.I have long appreciated Whedon's film making abilities and here he channels the work he made famous in Serenity, those fast zoom shots of ships exploding are used here, but not overdone. He also shoots action from interesting and random angles often panning through the back of destroyed cars and broken windows and styling shots that replicate comic book frames, which many fans will appreciate, but most will miss.The Avengers proves that comic book adaptions can work in the right hands and that screenwriters and directors need to have some understanding of what they are working with.This is the BEST comic book – SUPERHERO – film I have seen and is the mark by which all future films will be judged by.",9,19,37,27 April 2012
Gravity," Cameron is correct, the best space film of all time
","I have been waiting for this movie for years, yet I did not know that GRAVITY would be the film that re birthed my passion and love for the art and craft of film-making. I never knew that the simple premise of two stranded astronauts in space would bring about such exuberant and elated exclamations of absolute astonishment. Yet, from the moment I saw the most perfect image of the earth in the opening sequence of this film, I knew I was witnessing something special, something unique and something that would be seen as a pinnacle of the future of cinema – a film that historians would look back too as the genesis of the new age of film. Yes, it is that good. But let me tell you why. Alfonso Cauron does something not seen in film, that I can recall, ever. With the use of the 3D format, remarkable cinematography and the films unyielding soundtrack, he delicately and sneakily submerges us into the film with each slow tracking shot and close-up. It's not until the first 10 minutes has passed that you realise that this has occurred all in one sweeping, continuous shot. Yet so much has happened in it, so much detail and movement that you need to blink away the awe. It makes you feel weightless; like you are floating in the scene with Sandra and George. The 3D is often the winner throughout this film and adds the 'experience' that its supposed to offer you. This is 3D at its best, miles ahead of Avatar and appreciatingly used to advance the films narrative like Hugo. Films with minimal or singular characters have been done before, some successfully, some not so. To take on a film of this kind takes courage and a belief in the director's vision and faith in the writers story. Most recently – and successfully – the films Moon and Buried have centred on a plot of single characters to create a tense and meaningful story. Gravity relies on the fact that being lost in space, is second only to being lost at sea and both are equally frightening. Being adrift in the vastness of space is a hauntingly terrifying prospect considering the chances of being rescued are nil. And it is this image that replays over and over again; a solitary figure clad in white, untethered from the umbilical of safety, adrift against a blanket of black. It's frightening. I do not want to give away too much of the story. I would encourage you to remain impartial, don't go in with expectations and try not to read anything about how the plot of the story is revealed, slow take by slow take, but I will say that this is a well-crafted and executed idea. This is a story of triumph at its heart, a woman, and a strong (often flawed one) woman at that, overcomes the impossible when the easier option was to simply give up. The imagery is stark and brutally honest with cinematography that is fluid and beautiful. The majesty of the earth as the films backdrop provides awe and wonder, never getting in the way of the details or the characters. There are moments in this film where I found myself mesmerised by the action, often in the slow-motion of weightlessness, debris from a disintegrating space-station flies around the screen and into the audience at what feels like rapid motion, but is actually much slower. So much is said in the stillness and silence of the images presented on the screen. One moment I will mention is when Ryan (Sandra Bullock) enters the space station after breathing carbon monoxide for at least 5 minutes. The instant she is within the air lock and able to breathe oxygen she passes out in zero-gravity, spinning gently as if she was a foetus in the womb. It is stunning imagery like this that makes Gravity a beautiful film to watch. The other masterstroke of this film is the soundtrack and sound effects. Finally a film that does not shy away from the reality that in space no one can hear anything. To see exploding space stations, and space shuttles, without the sound of the explosion, all shown in the silence of space is truly a remarkable experience in itself. To think, we have been saturated with this unreal concept that anything that blows up in space does so as it would earth – loud and at normal speed, then when we see it how it really is, it is simply frightening. To see someone escape wayward debris that is travelling with no sound and in the weightless ness of zero-gravity, combined with the loud, thrilling operatic music that saturates the audience, you are not on the edge of your seat, but on the floor peeping through your fingers trying to swallow your heart. Gravity succeeds where so many films fail. It is simple. The script is easy. The story is basic and, but the way it is presented is astonishing.",10,9,14,26 October 2013
Man of Steel," Perhaps it should be called 'Super-Alien'
","Man of Steel almost proves that among the cavalcade of heroes, superheroes and mutants that are flooding cinema at the moment, there is no longer a place for the original Superman. I would not have thought that Superman could be muscled out of existence by other characters with less substance in their story, yet Man of Steels lacking script does just that – by trying too hard to be just 'like the others'. As the script focuses so much of its story on the fact that Superman is an alien sent to earth to save it, the organic 'real-world-ness' feel that worked so well for Batman, seems to fall flat here. The script clearly wants to tell the story of how Kal-El is an alien and as such, must come stop an alien force from destroying the planet, yet the narrative seems to get confused in trying to drive a story about how Clark (and Kal-El) is really a man, trapped in an alien's body. What works for the film is its heart, captured in the sensibilities of Kal's adoptive father Jonathan (Kevin Costner). As a kind of origin story that this film attempts to be, I found myself actually longing for more of the back story where Kal/Clark are learning about who he is and how he must harness not only his abilities, but the struggle between right and wrong and his longing for acceptance. Unfortunately, Zach needs to learn a thing or two about how to use flashbacks in a way that does not disrupt a films flow as many of the flashbacks felt thrown in for 'good measure'. Whilst the film is admirable in parts, its weak script and often corny dialogue rob it of the small steps it makes in forging a strong and rewarding plot. It jumps around uneasily and much of what happens is there for the spectacle and even the interactions between characters feel forced and over the top. And when you're left wondering why all of a sudden Lois and Superman kiss, you know deep in your heart there is more missing here than meets the eye. The script is a labor, literally from its opening scenes, and needed the elements of what makes humanity great to contrast against the dreary, broken world which Clark inhabits. There was no humor and where one-liners and quips from Alfred made Batman more digestible, there was very little to break the often relentless barrage of drama, yelling, anger and fighting. We needed to see that humanity was worth saving. In the end, when the choice has to be made, it feels like Superman/Clark/Kal-El is only saving us because he was told too. The reality is that there is nothing new here and in a burgeoning world of super-hero cinema, the hope it has of moving as far from the Lycra- clad world of Richard Donner's originals and even Bryan Singers 'remake/re imagining' does not give it enough punch to actually stand alone and apart from all the rest. At some points this film mistakes itself for Transformers and even Avengers and it's because 'we've seen it all before', the third act becomes a long, building-smashing, ground- destroying, punching, exploding cacophony of very little substance. And then when you least expect it, the last 5 minutes reveal what you wanted all along and didn't get causing you to throw your box of popcorn at the screen (this may have just been me).",6,1,2,29 June 2013
X-Men: First Class," Solid beginning to the franchise
","First Class is a welcome return to beginnings both cinematically and in narrative.Opening with scenes taken from Bryan Singers original X-Men where Erik (who will become Magneto) discovers his mutant power, First Class confidently walks the path made before it, but goes on to blaze a new trail of its own.Having left Last Stand angry and downright broken hearted, vehemently hating the name 'Brett Ratner', vowing that should I ever cross his path I would tear out his heart and shove it down his throat and make him choke to death.sorry. Rant over. I apologise. It still hurts.I still have not seen Wolverine, my best friend forbids it. Hell, I forbid it! But after seeing First Class I am happy to see it return to form. I only hope it stays the course.It is no doubt that the film is what it is because it starts with a credible story and script, has a strong cast and passionate director and producer. Director Matthew Vaughn successfully helmed last years sleeper hit, the ever-violent Kick Ass while Bryan Singer who directed the first two films, stepped in to offer assistance creatively and in a producing capacity. Singers subtle inflections and influence are noticeable throughout the narrative and production.The story is great at setting up a new, and earlier, chapter of the franchise; starting in 1944 at the peak of the German invasion and travelling through to the 1960's when the US was heading into the Cuban Missile crisis. Some exposition allows the story of Xavier (James McEvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) to come to the fore which then continues on through the rest of the film. This really is about a story about them and their internal battles; Xavier believing that the human world will accept them and Erik knowing that they will not. And this is where the story finds its strength.There is no doubt that X-men (the comic) is about human vs mutant and the deep rooted feelings of isolation, rejection and loneliness we all feel. The X-men are simply caricatures of humanity, hidden behind a power rather than a mask. First Class subtly weaves this through the core of its premise.What is also appreciated is that we get insight into is the friendship that Xavier and Eric share, right up to the fateful moment that puts Xavier in the wheelchair. Given that we only catch glimpses of this love/hate relationship in the previous films, it is refreshing to see especially for those who have not read the comics, however, for a prequel or reboot (or whatever you want to call it), perhaps a second film could have been focused on Eriks decision to create the Brotherhood. What I missed was the reference to Erik helping Xavier create the ..., but this could easily be visited in another film, they have always needed each other (as we see in Last Stand the exposition for Jean Greys character, they are friends meeting her together – although Erik has ulterior plans).The cast of mutants is impressive and as this is a film to set up the 'origins', each mutant gets adequate introduction and development (unlike previous films...sorry!).Hot-property-of-the-moment, January Jones (Mad Men, Unknown) makes a delicious sight as the scantily-clad, diamond-telepath Emma Frost. There's certainly more to this woman than meets the eye! And everyone's favourite shape-shifter Mystique (Raven) is introduced as a 9 years old who befriends Xavier which is a nice touch to the overall development of the story and a through line that will come full circle in the later films. It's an opportunity to provide the juxtaposition of Erik – who believes all mutants should embrace who they are and Charles (Xavier) who believes mutant powers should be concealed so that humanity will accept them. The core fight between acceptance and rejection lies squarely on Mystiques shoulders and carried confidently by relative newcomer Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone).Director Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass, Layer Cake) proves again he has flair for the comic-book adaptions, perhaps even better than Singer and must have enjoyed working with more money and scope to create a huge, and sometimes epic, motion picture. The scale of the action is mountainous and works hand-in-hand to propel the narrative forward as opposed to just being in it for the sake of the genre. Matthew Vaughn best be careful, lest he becomes the king of the comic geeks.In all, this is a brilliant film worthy of its positive critical acclaim.",9,1,3,24 June 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," It could easily have been the first
","Transformers 3 will be the blockbuster of the season, like it was made to be. There is no denying the pull that battle-crazy robots trying to save earth has on the general populous. Both previous films have grossed an amazing amount of cash in ticket sales and merchandising, that the third outing is a sure-fire definite to make people hand over their hard-earned cash-especially now since the film is in glorious 3D!It's no secret that summer blockbusters are the bread-and-butter of any production company. Most blockbusters are void of story lines and have plot holes you can drive a semi through. TF3 is no different, but there are times you are left wanting just a bit more; just a bit more development, a bit more sense and a bit more continuity.Yet, again what the film lacks is a sense of substance, although I concede that it must be difficult to find 'substance' in a story about children's toys that transform from robots to cars and trucks. The cartoon was simply a tool that Hasbro used to sell toys, specifically in Japan, yet the film version of that cartoon, released in 1986, did a really good job in finding substance in the mythos of Transformers. In that film, there were two human characters, a father and a son, which in its simplicity, was where the cartoons heart lay. They were a manifestation of Prime's heart of humanity, a thread that these films so desperately need and is so jarringly absent.It's just not enough to save the world, we want to care about it.TF3 is missing that substance. Where we want to see robots, the story focuses too much on Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebeouf) who is at the next crossroads of his life: getting a job. We had his teen ager angst in getting his first car, then the young adult angst of going to university, and now we have his adult angst of making his mark on the world, but, hasn't he already done that? He saved the world from near destruction, yet, he can't get a job?The exposition which sets up the story rests on the shoulders of another government secret. Much to Primes dismay, there is a spacecraft just sitting there on the moon waiting for some transformer to find it. It seems that it is the Ark (a nice reference to the cartoon) which was sent at the height of the Cybertronian war with a device on board that would create a new Cybertron. How it works with the Cube, I'm not sure, but the ark crash landed on the moon which caused the space race of the 60's between Russia and the US. For any 'fan' or movie buff, the enormous plot hole that exists here is not worthy of bothering about and many may simply gloss over it, but as a story, the three films don't fit together well, but when you think about it, very few series of films do. But where this film lacks in story, it succeeds in attacking the audience with an astounding shock and awe campaign to numb your senses. As with the first two films, there are some insane action sequences that show off Bay's style, flair and ego. Gratefully, Bay has slowed down some of the action and sequences so that the audience gets to see more, however there are still times you really wish you could differentiate between the robots when they are clashing. Bay knows how to shoot war and fighting and cars – especially cars, and he pushed TF3 the the extreme. He really does lift the bar for action.It is mind-boggling to see some of the scenes take place; especially in 3D. The scene of the skyscraper falling down in the trailer can only be seen on the big screen, it is simply that breathtaking and looks so good. The enormity of clashing robots and speeding cars that transform while driving to catch falling humans, simply leaves you aghast. There is even a freeway sequence that gives 'The Matrix: Reloaded' a run for its money.The robots look fantastic. If they could look more real than from what we have previously seen, this is the film that does it. They blend in with the earthly surrounds and interact with human characters in a far more believable way. There are some darker moments too where the film takes on a 'Black Hawk Down' feel and there is much more violence, which surprised me. Robots gush blood, have their spines ripped out and humans are vicerated by Decepticon weapons similar to that of the aliens from 'War of the Worlds'. There is much more robot time which will please the masses and you get the feeling that the film is trying really hard to cater to the fans this time although die hards will be very disappointed that certain Autobots don't have the names they are supposed to, but there is plenty to be happy about. The inclusion of Primes trailer is a welcome addition and when it transforms, OMG! Megatron is the real let down. Again, Bay and Kruger have no idea what to do with him nor do they understand is role in the Transformers world. This villain is underused which is disappointing. The transfer to 3D is astounding; groundbreakingly so. 60% of the film was filmed in 3D and unlike films that have the transfer added for the sake of it, this movie is meant to be enjoyed as a 3D experience. It has raised the bar since Avatar. There is a lot of potential left in the Tranformer world. It's doubtful this will be the end and it would not be surprising if the fans really get their own way and we see the introduction of the famed Unicron.\",8,21,34,29 June 2011
