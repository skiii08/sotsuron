Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Both hilarious and insightful
","If laughing your face off in a theater is any indication of a good comedy, then Borat is a great comedy. Yet, it has a serious hidden message. With the premise of an ignorant foreigner, Borat uncovers the dark underbelly of racist America. The movie is brilliant in making a mockumentary with a message. One one level, I would call it Jackass with a purpose. Some of the stunts Cohen pulls are dangerous. When he isn't engaged in Stooge-like gaffs, he incites people to threaten physical harm. Yet, I laughed through the whole thing.I rate this movie a 9 instead of 10 because the humor is often crude and may offend a large portion of America. But I think that is what it was meant to do.NICE! Great Success!",9,3,11,14 November 2006
The Thing," Sci-Fi Horror at it's best
","This is probably one of the most underrated films in the sci-fi world.  I am still blown away by this movie.  This review is for the Collector's Edition DVD.To me, how a DVD is constructed is as important as the content itself. Unlike most DVDs that force you to sit through warnings that noone reads and studio logos that nobody cares about, this DVD gets it right.  You drop the DVD in your player and it plays the movie just like you would see it in the theater.  Studio logo followed by opening credits.I absolutely love the opening sequence of music and credits followed by the helicopter chasing the dog.  You are instantly thrust into the madness caused by the alien intruder and the ride continues until the movie ends. It is never boring, yet doesn't rush the storyline and dialog like so much of Hollywood drek these days.I recently saw Alien and thought about the similarities to The Thing.  In the end, I have to say The Thing may be a better movie for one reason - it is closer to home - i.e. planet Earth.  Each movie rates in my top ten, but I have to put The Thing one notch higher than Alien.The extras on the CD are a mixed bag.  The interviews with cast and crew are quite good, with a fully produced sequence, including clever variances of the title sequence.  The commentary over the movie is only for the most hard-core fans, since you have to sit through the entire movie listening the John Carpenter and Kurt Russell chat.In summary, watch this movie.  It is a classic!",10,0,1,9 August 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Excellent adaptation of a great book
","There is one measure that very few movies even qualify for - visceral thrill.  There were several instances during the movie when I felt an emotional feeling that you rarely get with movies, especially as a male. Amongst those rare movies, the sad ones are prevalent and most capable of extracting emotional attachment by the viewer.The rarer species are those movies that generate positive exuberance.  In my case, 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is one of them.Having read all 4 books to my son, I was quite familiar with the subject matter.  Despite fore-knowledge of the plot, I was enraptured by the story. I felt like a kid again, totally entranced by a wonderful story of magic wrapped around the classic battle of good vs. evil.  Despite all the hype, I did not emerge a jaded cynic.  It met all my expectations and perhaps a little bit more.I felt the casting was excellent.  Snape (Alan Rickman) stands out in my mind as a perfect match for his role.  I also felt that the adaptation to film was well done.  Some things are better left in the book.  Some things actually work better in film, such as the Quidditch match.Some reviewers may say that this movie does not stand on its own.  Perhaps not, but is that necessarily a bad thing?  Think of it as complement to the book.  In this case, a great complement!",10,0,0,17 December 2001
Jurassic Park," Best dino experience so far
","Note:  This is a review of the Collector's Edition DVD.In summary, awesome, totally awesome.  This movie has shown what home theater can really be.  For the first time, I felt like I was 'at the movies'.  The scenes with T-rex and other dinos were incredible.I gave this movie a 10 for creating a truly immersive experience of living with dinosaurs.  As I watched, I started picking up on various continuity errors and mistakes.  However, I reminded myself of what Speilberg was trying to achieve.  He is willing to accept some of these 'technical glitches', for the purpose of moving the plot or creating a scene.In the end, the movie wins because you get dragged into the experience. It isn't anything good for mankind, it's mostly just fun.  However, what helps push this movie to the top is the sub-plot warning man to be careful when playing with genetics.  I think the message should be well taken in light of the latest accomplishments in genetics (e.g. cloning).  Who are we to play god and what are the unexpected consequences.  Most compelling and true are the words of Jeff Goldblum's character, Malcolm:  '...life finds a way'.DVD extra note:  I believe this DVD has replaced 'The Matrix' as my demo disc to show off my home theater.",10,3,4,24 March 2002
