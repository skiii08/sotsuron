Hereditary," I am very critical when it comes to this genre so.....
","For me to ever be squeamish during is movie is saying a lot. I found it extremely disturbing to watch at times... (its just a movie, its just a movie- keep repeating to yourself when needed) I concur with other users; was a tad let down at the end. his ending has been done before. None the less worth the watch!",7,0,1,1 October 2018
Passengers," A Little Something for BOTH sexes!
","Great date night movie. Probably will not be what you expect. I hate science fiction but this movie is much more than just some silly flick with spaceships and outer space. The plot is fresh, surprising, and unique.Jennifer Lawrence ,as always, is on point and gives the viewer their moneys worth. Phenomenal 'Star Wars' quality sets and special effects. I imagine the majority of the movie's budget went towards special effects, computerization and props. This flick probably just reset the standards.Take a chance on this flick. You will be glad that you did and it might just make your list of favorites!",7,2,4,11 February 2017
Split," The Male Version of Sybil! but failed to go where it needed.
","M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite writers and directors so I was really psyched about this flick and it was greatly anticipated. Just to be clear, this is not meant to be a horror flick but rather a psychological thriller. So don't go in to watch this movie thinking its a scary movie and expect the 'BOO!' factor.Mcavoy gives his most epic performance; undoubtedly his career's finest as well as most difficult. And sadly, I am sure will also be overlooked by the Academy.The story line is successful in keeping the viewer engaged throughout the entire film. While the movie begins to unfolds it somewhat mirrors the 1970s film 'Sybil'; a woman afflicted with D.I.D. going thru the motions with each different personality along with the psychologist. Except THIS time it was a man. Yet the plot was still fresh and entertaining with a touch of crime and severe mental illness thrown in for extra fun.The disappointment only comes as the ending starts to unfold. What was intended to be a 'twist' in the ending was a 'Marvel Comics' style cameo by Bruce Willis making a reference to a 'Mr. Glass' which was a character from the movie 'Unbroken'; another Shyamalan flick. Is this an indication of an 'Unbreakable 2' or are the two movies suggested to be connected? Who knows because the whole ending and unfolding of the ending failed miserably. If the viewer had never seen 'Unbroken' or didn't remember the movie, the ending was even MORE ambiguous. I had seen 'Unbroken' and still felt like I wasn't following and left with yet another frustrating ending. Also not Shyamalan's style. I expected much more from this flick. I WANTED to LOVE it. It almost seems like Shyamalan just gave up when it came to finishing off the story. Not bad but not great either. Definitely not Shyamalan greatness.",6,1,9,16 February 2017
Get Out," Mark my words, THIS will be the most talked about film of the decade!
","Yes, I promise this great little horror flick will be the most discussed and debated about movie of the decade! (And not because of the film itself, but the 'racial issue' the story outlines) The writer of this flick, Jordan Peele, is a pure genius. Not only did he give us something completely new, fresh, and completely original, but he had the guts to touch on what will surely be a completely controversial topic. Love or hate this movie, sparks are sure to fly over the story line and subject matter. You know that a federal issue is made out of anything and everything these days by the bleeding heart - political correctness gang and everything is made out to be racial issue or have prejudicial undertones that is going to send people off the deep end or result in the infamous 'hurt feelings'. So if you are one of those cry babies, you better pass on this movie or you might just have a stroke.For everyone else, this surprising and delightful little horror flick is a must see! Peele not only is able to keep you glued to the screen and on the edge of your seat, but also keeps you guessing from start to finish. Just when you think you know where the plot is going, BOOM! You get tossed in a different direction. And just as a bonus, there are some great comedic moments.So before everyone sees this movie and starts getting ticked off and ugly about the subject matter, do yourself a favor and go see this mini masterpiece of bizarre macabre! Hurry before the PC whiners ruin it for you!",7,9,16,30 April 2017
The Hangover Part II," Best of the 3 in the series
","Never a dull moment while the Wolfpack is over in Thailand- not Vegas. The insanity has gone international this time. Was a tad surprised to not see higher ratings here on IMDb- this is clearly the best out of the 3 Hangover movies. It does help if you have seen the first one or you will be a tad lost So if you haven't seen the Hangover (The first one) then watch it before you see this one. All of the original cast from the first one returns for this sequel. But fair warning; they don't hold back on ANYTHING! This one pushes it to the limit, which is part of what makes it so great. Not for the easily offended- nothing is sacred in this one. Down right raunchy at times but full of laughs and many surprises from beginning to end.",7,0,0,11 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not what I expected
","With all the hype of bringing back the original cast, one would think this movie would have been fantastic and geared around the old favorite characters. Right? WRONG.Are the writers and producers so obtuse they didn't realize the selling point of this episode was the return of the original characters? You know that is what everyone was expecting when they paid for their ticket, only to be sadly let down.While the movie does contain all the flair with special effects and amazing visuals expected in a Star Wars episode (Which is the only reason I scored this film a 5) but let's down the viewer by neglecting to write the old characters into to the story.If you are going to watch this flick hoping to see your old favorites with the storyline revolving around them, you will be sadly disappointed. To give you an idea; Mark Hamill doesn't even have a speaking role. Hi camera time was about 10 seconds. No exaggeration.",5,13,14,26 September 2016
