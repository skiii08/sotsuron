Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Worst movie I have ever seen
","I am Romanian and due to the totalitarian regime I was part of for all my childhood and youth, I learned to enjoy real situational comedy that was making fun of the regime and society of the time. That was apparently in your face, raw humor, but rather subtle and genuine that could make you laugh and cry at the same time.This movie does not deserve to be called racist or offensive or comic or smart or anything. It attempts in a very childish way to extract some laughs, that's all. Any 7 year old can make fun of people this way.I cannot comprehend why the North American public likes this low and childish humor, other than to think that most regular citizen born on this continent live within some boundaries and clich√©s that make them narrow minded. Perhaps the people in this society that collectively attributed such a high rating to this movie have not been exposed enough to hardship and tragedy in order to be able to use real humor to laugh at itself other than using gross jokes.I was upset, angry and frustrated after seeing this movie and I profoundly regret every penny I spent on the ticket and if there was any way to recover them I would be first in line. Don't be the next one, please.",1,351,704,30 November 2006
