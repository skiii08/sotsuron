The Ring," Good adaptation..
","Contains Spoilers! This movie is originally adapted from the Japanese movie, with the same title. The American version for The Ring is okay, but I prefer the Japan version... Because -- Spoiler -- 1. Samara (Sadako) is even scarier because in fact she is a beautiful teenager but she has an evil twin who will kill anyone she dears. 2. Anna Morgan (Sadako's Mother) was originally pregnant by sea-devil, and intended to kill the babies by drowning them to the sea. And she has supernatural ability to see the future and some of her sights are captured by Samara (Sadako) and she 'broadcasted' it. 3. Samara (Sadako)'s father is the one who killed her and then kill himself. 4. Samara (Sadako) survived for 30 years in the well, trying to escape by climbing up but she never made it. Her anger affected the village nearby by broadcasting her thoughts through the television. A local villager recorded the strange broadcast and then people started to see the cursed video tape. 5. With this story line, it is possible to make the prequel (Ringu 0, The Birth -- which is VERY scary --) the story of the birth of Sadako, and the sequel (Ringu 2) the death of Sadako.So.. get the original version and start to watch..",Null,0,0,2 February 2003
