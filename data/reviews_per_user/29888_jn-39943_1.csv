Vertigo," Good -but one of his BEST - on the edge about that!
","Don't get me wrong. Alfred Hitchcock like Rod Serling were definitely ahead of their time in many ways.
One reason I don't like Vertigo is strictly personal - I understand Hitchcock's obsession with Grace Kelly and when she was no longer available he picked each actress and dressed them as he had Miss Kelly(much like the character Scottie does to Judy) but why Kim Novak who is as stiff and cold as her bleached white hair?
But my main reason is because Hitchcock the master of suspense takes it away TOO SOON!
There's NO REASON for him to reveal the truth about Judy right after they met. That could have been kept a secret until they return to the church -she could confess to him and he could say he'd figured it out and that was why he brought her there!
Whenever they get to that part of the movie I turn it off because it's over as far as I'm concerned.
I don't know why people rank it so highly compared to Dial M for Murder or Psycho or Rear Window metal?",4,1,10,27 April 2019
