First Man," Incredibly dissapointing!
","Takes one of mankinds's greatest adventures and turns it into a boring grind which is way too long. Not sure if the portrayal of Armstrong as a sullen individual deeply affected by the death of his daughter from cancer and his commrades in the Apollo 1 fire is accurate. If it is, I would seriously doubt he was emotionally fit to command Apollo 11.",3,14,24,22 October 2018
