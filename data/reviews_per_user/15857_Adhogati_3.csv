Sucker Punch," The Uninvited meets steampunk and acoustic rock in the alleys of Snyder's mind!
","What a movie!!! Before I move on to praise it to bits, it must say that it is a love it or a hate it type of a movie and I very clearly loved it.Trying to describe this movie for me is akin to a synaesthete trying to describe colours to a blind person. The sheer imagery defies words. The execution of imagination is brilliant.Like it was said in many reviews, there isn't a strong script and this is one of those movies which does not need it. The music, the dark visual style, the steampunk action sequences will either make you groan or make you sit up and dig deeper and deeper into your popcorn bucket.Every last pixel is well imagined and the visual tapestry that is a result of Snyder's imagination and astounding vfx will blow everything off into the background.Imagine the best fight sequences of LOTR mated with the slo-mo of matrix and the mood of 300 you will have a very slight idea of what this is all about. Go watch the movie with this expectation and it will still blow your mind.Okay, my conscience wants me to say something more, but feel free not to read this - makes no difference.Emily Browning's deadpan expressions are a slight drawback, but then with Cornish, Hudgens, Zepplins, Monsters, Katanas and the rest on screen, you barely get to notice Browning's shortcomings.",8,24,46,25 March 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," An Absolute Romp for Tintin Fans!
","I would have given this movie an 8, but that would have been a disservice in general. While those who have read and loved Tintin would immensely enjoy every frame of the movie, those who are being introduced to the Character the first time around are likely to miss a few things here and there.Yes, Tintin is brilliantly swashbuckling, and Haddock amazingly entertaining, but the story seems a trifle hurried while the pacing in some sequences in patchy.What deserves a 10 on 10 however is the way Red Rackham's tale is woven into the story and how it was so evocatively presented, along with reference to a few characters which paved the path for any sequels that would be forthcoming.Top marks to Spielberg an Jackson for sticking to the books even while weaving an original story line! Must Watch!",7,17,32,11 November 2011
Sicario," Dark, Brutal, and Benicio Del Toro
","One of those rare movies when the flagship star is completely sidelined by veteran steamrollers. Like a dark cloud getting lost in the afterglow of the silver-lining.I am not an American, but I could see some political undertones in this movie, and I cannot comment on it. As an uninformed viewer, I tend to agree with most of the reviewers here in that this movie is fantastic.It is one of those subtle, insidious thrillers that take you to the edge of your seat without you even realising it. I watched it on a lazy Sunday evening, and despite the cold rainy weather, I suddenly became part of a delta team that was undertaking a covert operation.The best part about the movie is that it does not rely on 'blockbuster' action sequences. It banks on the human element, and it pays off in the most consummate of ways.Despite the presence of Emily Blunt, who did a blisteringly good job, the movie rides on the very able, intense shoulders of the Bull, egged on by the staggeringly awesome tongue-in cheekily serious performance of Josh Brolin.This is one movie you ought to watch!",8,1,3,16 July 2017
