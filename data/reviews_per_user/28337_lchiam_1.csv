The Lobster," Who are you people who rated this high?
","I'm thinking I watched a different movie than most here. First, to say this is a comedy (dark or otherwise) is to say that Young Frankenstein was Horror flick. Oh sure there were maybe 1 or 2 comical lines (I counted) but that was about it. Second, to try and claim this is some reflection on modern relationships is BS. There was no need to make this movie unless the point was to dumb down the audience - and it worked. We kept waiting to find out the point of all what was going on only to be left confused with the ending and more confused why we sat through the whole thing. I'm seriously thinking of asking Redbox for my $2.00 back (I feel even dumber for choosing blue ray)",1,14,21,14 August 2016
