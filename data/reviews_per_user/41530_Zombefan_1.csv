Iron Man 3," A good kick-ass time with Mr. Stark
","I am a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr. and his work in all three of the Iron Man films. Robert's witty banter and comedic timing is spot on and makes him the perfect Tony Stark in my book. I will start by saying this review comes from a not so religious comic book fan. So you will get a complete outsiders perspective. Good: Visual effects are pretty outstanding. I don't think people realize the time and effort goes into making just single still frame of one of these movies.Tony looses his house, girlfriend and his gadgets and has to come up with some ghetto rigged gadgets, I like that idea.Acting was never an issue here, The Mandarin character stole the stage at some points In the film, nice to see some new humor to break up the action.The villains were pretty decently scary and entertainingTony has made it to where he doesn't need to be in his suit to use them. Great idea and added some edge to the film to mess with the audience.I could go on and on but I have to be UN-biased and get to the bad parts.Bad:Tony is a genius but yet he has no home defense?Tony makes his suit only compatible to himself yet, he throws it on Pepper and the main villain?Tony now gets panic attacks? I guess they ruined The Mandarin character for the comic book fans.Tony gives up the Iron Man life at the end, or so it seems...Kinda ruins the plot, (unless Marvel has some up their sleeve) for the Avengers 2.The plot elements for Tony' Iron Man armor is weak. It can take beatings from Thor and Aliens, but a few messily solders can tear them apart?So I mean the film isn't perfect, but what movies are. There will always be a negative Nacy to tear down a film. Like I always say 'Don't knock it before you try it', filmmaking is hard work and I highly doubt a lot of the negative viewers could make a better film if they tried. Yes I agree a comic book adaptation should be keep very similar to the comic. I am a huge Resident Evil fan and look what they did to my films :/ so I know how you feel. Just keep in mind that they probably wrote the script for viewers like me who had no prior knowledge of the comic book history. It was a great film and I will be recommending this highly. Good luck, and Goodnight",8,0,1,19 May 2013
