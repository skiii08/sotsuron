The Legend of Bagger Vance," If you think this movie was really about golf....
","...then you need to go back and watch it again.  This beautifully shot movie uses the game of golf as an analogy for life and coming to grips with one's past.  Rannulph Junuh, a local golf hero (played by Matt Damon), returns home from the Great War, the only survivor of his company.  Unable to shake the horrors of war, he becomes a recluse, attempting to drown his pain in whiskey and alienating all he loves, including his former girlfriend, played by Charlize Theron.  It is only through the intervention of a young aspiring golfer (J. Michael Moncrief) and the mysterious new caddy, Bagger Vance (Will Smith), that Junuh faces his fears and starts actively playing the game of life again.  In addition to the lush cinematography, the actors were well cast and gave strong and colorful performances.  The musical score, written by Rachel Portman, was entertaining in its own right, in addition to perfectly complimenting the film's 1930s setting.  I look forward to hearing more of her work.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who's feeling a little disillusioned - the feeling you'll leave the theater with is more than worth the ticket price.",10,0,1,5 November 2000
