10 Cloverfield Lane," Complicated but ultimately worthwhile films
","This is a complicated film to evaluate:The first 90% of the film is an absolutely brilliant character-driven thriller set in the claustrophobic confines of an emergency bunker and was as sharply acted as a cerebral Broadway play. The tense, complex plot included the ever fluctuating question of Howard's sanity, in stellar performance by John Goodman; the chemistry between the 3 actors is top-notch as their characters' relationships shift and deteriorate; and then the suspenseful, violent semi-finale was ultra compelling. But then there's the controversial final ending:I agree with other reviews that the sudden alien attack is extremely disjointed, but altogether, I actually think it kind of works. First of all, it turned out that Howard _was_telling the truth, and the world as they knew it was no longer safe. And yet, given how things unfolded in the bunker, it raises the core philosophical theme of the movie: What is worse, the monsters that attack us, or the monsters in ourselves?Secondly, this also worked as a sequel--the first film was about the initial invasion of the Godzilla-like creature and similar monsters, while this movie was about the full blown invasion.Also, I actually think the Cloverfield films are refreshingly realistic depictions of what what would happen in such a disaster: Will Smith doesn't zoom in with a fighter jet to save the day, and The Rock won't march us to safety as he punches out everything in his path. As both Cloverfield films depict, people will freak out, turn on each other, make incredibly stupid decisions, but somehow a few survive to fight another day. And each movie shows a distinct perspective: the first Cloverfield movie could be taken as a broad depiction of how the disaster sweeps through millions in the cities, while this second film is an intimate portrait of how people in isolation deal with the same/similar disaster.Overall, I highly recommend this as a strong stand-alone film, as well as the clear standout of the Cloverfield series.",9,1,2,24 October 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best film EVER made.
","I'm not an avid movie buff, but I've seen a good number of movies in theaters, on TV, VHS, DVD, and so on.  I've seen many of the classics, old and contemporary: silent films, Golden Age epics, classic romances, landmark trilogies like The Godfather, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Oscar winners, not-so-great movies, and many others.But up until now, I had NEVER seen anything that left me as thoroughly entertained and satisfied as 'The Return of the King.'  With all other films, my reaction has been, 'That was good, BUT...'  There was too much violence, too much sex, the acting wasn't that great, the plot dragged in parts, the story became confusing, the special effects were corny, and the list goes on.But 'The Return of the King' lived up to every inch of hype and was a stellar film in every aspect:  the battle scenes were as exciting and brutal as any action movie sequence, yet the deep bonds of friendship and love between the members of the Fellowship and other characters provided some the most moving drama I've ever seen.  Every acting performance was superb, the production and special effects were amazing, and the overall film was an absolute triumph that leaves viewers with a lot to think about.
I personally think that the entire LOTR trilogy is the best film EVER made in the history of film, and you don't have to be a Tolkien fan to appreciate it. My entire family went to see the film:  first of all, considering how picky my parents are about the films they watch, the fact that they LOVED it is a sure sign of its quality; secondly, half of my family had never read the books, and they still enjoyed the film; and finally, we could not stop talking about the movie for DAYS.I highly recommend that you go see it!",Null,0,1,29 December 2003
