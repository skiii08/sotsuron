The Blair Witch Project," Second comment:
","Wanted to add a little something as I was reading down on the comments.  1. Thumbs up to the guy who said it was a comedy.  Hey I agree with you. Though I thought the ending was a tad scary.  That 5 minutes is probably scarier than anything in The Haunting.  But I loved The Haunting far more because of that damn house.  But the biggest problem with THAT movie is it's labeled as a Horror movie.  Not as an adventure movie.  I'd say it almost seems the same creative team behind The Mummy, also did The Haunting. (not a known fact). and 2.  To the person who'll never be alone in the woods again. Hey you'll be missing alot.  I remember once when I was young (88-89 somewhere ) That there was this place (private land, but we had permission) not far from a church out in the country near Lewiston, MN, that was named Ruprects (spelling?) Valley.  We went into a cave , it being small, us guys went over a good pool, spiders and all, and we went way in there on our hands and knees.  Since the girls couldn't make it across that pool, they had to call us back. (I was 1 of only 3 people who bothered to make it all the way in) But anyway... I and 2 girls bothered to get lost in the woods. We though managed to find our way out of that.  Sure I we wound up go a hill at an 80% incline, but what the hell.  This is the reason I have to laugh at this most unrealistic movie.  It was shot very well (or should I say they were radical in doing so), but watching three people swear in the woods, isn't what I call scary as hell.....",6,0,2,10 January 2000
The Blair Witch Project," Excellently shot, but this isn't a horror movie. It's a comedy!!
","That's right.  With a laugh at every turn.  Anyone who was scared by this movie hadn't watch a horror movie (opinion only... not basis for fact).  Now if you wanna be scared ____less, watch Evil Dead.  I watched that one all the way through once.  But every time I try to watch it..  I'm going no way..  But with Blair Witch the only possibly scary moment might have been the final 3 minutes.  Otherwise it was a nice trip in the woods.  We kinda got lost in the woods once.  When I was young say in 7 or 8th grade.  So this movie was a tad silly.  I did like how it was shot though, as well as the square movie box look.  6 out of 10..",6,0,1,21 November 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Explains Why it is, the movies should have been in one piece.
","(SPoilers??)The first volume was a  big surprise for me.  It was a fun watch and pretty cool.  However we get to the second movie and find out why this movie should have been the second half of the first movie.  Miramax clearly made a tactical error here.  The movie as it's presented doesn't match up with the first movie 's ending.  1 star knocked off.  The movie is rather shoved up with dialogue.  Mostly air riddled useless dialogue.  (some claim hey it's the romance part of the story.  BS!)  Hey Kill Bill isn't supposed to be boring.  And WTF with the ending?  Now we know why QT wants to make a third movie in 15 years.Still it's not a total loss.  If your learning to be a film student, or if radical camera angles excites you.  (like me) then by all means enjoy.  But I'd rather re watch Hidalgo.  Hopefully Hellboy will be better.6/10Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 9/10",6,1,3,22 August 2004
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Not The Natural, but getting close.
","Wanna watch a movie that brings in the family in droves? This has gotta be it.(spoilers might be included)I'm hedging on 9 1/2 stars with this movie.  Not a strong ten otherwise. The end of the movie is ever so slightly disappointing as other than a dance you never find out what happens to Junuh.  Although we find out what happens to the dude who seems to have passed on, whilst on the fareway.Bagger we are pretty sure is some sort of an angel.  In some ways it's kinda like Always.  Junuh might not have died, but his spirit did for awhile, until Bagger brought it back.This has got to be Matt Damon's best movie.  (Saving Private Ryan is more a tom hanks movie in my opinion)Glad Redford made the choice to put Matt as the lead and not himself.  He's the better director anyway. However Robert Redford's best movie effort is still A River Runs Through It by far.",10,0,1,22 April 2001
Vertigo," Haunting of course. It'll stay with you for a few days.
","Not to be watched late at night.  But it was a fun movie.  James Stewart was at his best within this movie.

Men in Black 3," Tugging on Emotions and lacking it's humor. Major cons.
","This one was a touch more violent than the previous 2. MIB was cartoonishly violent. This real humans (erm characters) get killed with sharp spikes. Not cool. And without Tommy's Dead Panning Josh can't even try to do it right. It's an okay movie ... But the first one is better. Second one is a good escape. This one does not need to wrap storylines up. Zero imagination now :( I'll give it a 6 but not happy. Now I know why it took 7 yrs to watch it. True I lost track of movies 2009-2016 but Warcraft got me back on it.

Ali," 2 1/2 hour long music video. Not good
","Spoilers??This movie is way overlong.  This movie could have been an hour shorter with a good director.  Instead there's tons of gas in between important moments. That and if you're an outsider to boxing, you'll be utterly confused.  And if you don't know much about Ali's life, but know about him and his fights, it's still gonna screw you up.And there's no time element here.  You can't tell what's the sixties or the seventies.  It's like....okay Malcolm X is dead... oh and there went MLK jr. It's all a blur to me.  It's like they took Ali's life and threw it in a blender and voila.  ALI.Another thing that got me is Mario Van Pebbles.  Perhaps the stupidest casting job I've seen in decades.  Mario can't carry a movie.  It's virtually impossible.After all that.. Will Smith does indeed shine.  It's too bad he had a horrible movie to do it with.  6/10Quality: 4/10 Entertainment: 7/10     (last half hour does it) Replayable: 3/10",6,0,1,20 September 2002
The Ring," Just awful. Some of the worst acting ever to grace the screen.
","(spoilers!!)Good god!  Are people that dumb to think this is a great movie?  I'm just posing a question, not to say that they are.  But really.  This thing has virtually no acting whatsoever.  I was not impressed.  This movie couldn't scare a mouse even if it wanted to.  It's also emotionless.  It's basically and truely an americanized version of Ringu.  And it goes with all the blame.  Blame the parents, blame the parents.  The original movie put the blame on mistreatment from the mother perhaps, but mostly the doctor who killed her.  But in The Ring, the father is at fault, the mother kills the girl.  And the movie doesn't end all that good.The pace of the movie is poor.  Takes 55 minutes to go thru 6 days and 60 minutes to go thru 1 day.  Alot of the movie doesn't make sense.  The video is totally stupid. (the one we ain't supposed to watch)The timelines are rediculous.  That cabin is far older than 40-50 years.  It looks like it was built in the late 1800's.  And even at that, I grew up going to this cabin that was built in 1910 and it looked far nicer.  (yes it was a cabin.  paper thin walls built on bricks type thing) 
The girl is too cute of a monster.  Compared to Ringu which never really lets you see the face.  I basically assume that the creators were aiming at folks who either loved Blair Witch Project (or god forbid it's sequel) or as it's pretty obvious, The Sixth Sense.  Putting the focus on the kid.  Which for a good chunk of the movie the mother could care less for.My recommendation.  Watch Ringu first.  Then watch this movie at your own risk.  Ringu is very deceptive.  Certainly it won't make you jump watching it, but don't walk round in the dark for awhile.The Ring will make you want these people to die.  Especially that stupid brainless mother.  Who acts smarter than she is.3/10

Deepwater Horizon," Give it a 7 , Some story mostly action.
","Not that it's a bad film. If you have an amp that thing is blowing up. Brings back bad memories though. Does this review contain spoilers. If you haven't heard the story by now, okay yeah who lives and who does . Nah. But you can look it up and should. Don't need a movie for that. Movie is well done as far as ignorance goes. But I didn't learn anything new except for one single thing. The people. This is for all intents and purposes a tear jerker wrapped in an action film. The Foley's, well that bird did come on in.

Training Day," Okay. Nothing special though.
","(Spoilers!!)
I did like Ethan Hawke's performance.  It was quite good.I guess Denzel was okay.  Not one of his best performances, bit above average though.The story was rather thin.  Sure it was complicated with alot of mush.  It did keep me pretty interested.  But at many times it was like yawn.  But I finish movies normally and this movie wasn't that bad. 
The ending was dumb.  I kinda liked the alternate ending shown on the dvd. But I'm not sure how well they could fix the russian link.  the russian link was probably the silliest part.Now it's really weird seeing this other actor (the one that tries to kill Ethan until he finds out Ethan's a good guy.  as in if it weren't for him, his cousin woulda been raped)  but I watched two movies last night.  This one and Three Kings.  Had I known the actor before I watched Whale Rider it mighta been interesting.  And I think he's best acting job is in Whale Rider.  Oh well, I'm not gonna attack this movie.  But I just didn't find it that interesting.7/10Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 5/10 Replayable: 6/10",7,1,12,20 June 2004

","Spoilers??This movie is rather difficult to get into at first.  But once your hooked.. it's difficult to pull away.This movie is rather powerful in it's attempt to seduce you.  It has an art house type feel to it.  Scenes are imagined to show the viewer what the character feels like etc etc...  I do find it interesting on the personality split.  It's kinda like A Beautiful Mind, but based on total fiction.  But whereas ABM you knew he was messed up...  you don't know it in Fight Club.The only thing wrong with this movie I felt... was the annoying narration.9/10Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10",9,0,1,6 August 2002

Darkest Hour," Compared to Dunkirk one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
","Emotionally packed. A movie where I had wikipedia around just to look up dates and wanted to learn more. Dunkirk is missing that , probably because it lacks a story. Darkest Hour has a story, great acting and isn't detracted by the fact it isn't an action movie nor poor editing. More for those who have seen too many of such movies like Dunkirk and needed a fresh perspective. Not sure why this movie is rated lower than Dunkirk. Maybe because the trailer for the dunking was played more.. Tons of plot holes in that movie. In Darkest Hour it's primarily the Secretary who wasn't hired till later the next year and she didn't have a brother. Rather emotionally packed film. Especially the bit of him just leavig the bloody car and oh hello how do I get to Westminster ?? and lady looks at him mouth on floor uh. um this line , that enetire scene was tears of joy..

Monster," Pretty much your average Lifetime TV movie.
",(spoilers? crap it's supposedly based on real life. how can I spoil anything?? :)I've been trying to watch every movie in the best actress field for the Oscar's. It's kinda like hey Charlize won. But I wanna know what I think is the best actress in that field. I was really rooting for Keisha Castle Hughes.So far. 21 Grams completely surprised me. It's beyond depressing. Some of the movie is silly. But the acting was very good from a lot of folks in that movie.So here I am on the main movie. Monster. And was a bit of a disappointment as far as acting goes. sure Charlize was okay. But her acting didn't truly take a nice shine except during the courtroom hearing at the very end.The first half of this movie was pretty good. But after 55 minutes... they rush things. This is a rushed movie. It's about 30 minutes too short. They left our massive amounts of information I think was needed to make this movie work. I know it's basically a Hollywood trait to rush things or skim a story down (heck I really liked A Beautiful Mind. But it was knocked down a notch after finding out tons of info was left out. Which I won't get into here.)The capture was especially stupid. Supposedly it was indeed a lot harder to catch Ailleen than in the movie.The movie might have worked a lot better had it come out on Lifetime. And trust me... my mother has that on a lot and I catch a lot better movies on there than this one. And some are so real... I just don't watch em.Someone here has made this woman seem like a pretty good girl. I'm assuming she isn't. And the movie seems to point some of the blame at Selby. Which I found to be rather meanBut the makeup was perhaps the worst. Sure it made Charlize look ugly. But she looks worse than the real Ailleen. It was overdone perhaps. Not only that. The makeup was clearly not applied to her arms.Oh well. It's an okay movie. Just take this movie with a grain of salt. As it says in the credits. Most of the movie is ficticious. Except for Ailleen. Any similarity to people or places is unintentional.(PS: I really liked the score. very good!!!)6/10Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 5/10 Replayable: 3/10,6,2,4,25 June 2004
The Rookie," Not bad and surprisingly too. But feels to much like Field of Dreams.
","(Spoilers??)Now I'm not saying that it means we've got people running out of cornfields. But the setup is almost the same.  Now of course since this is a true story.... I can't say that the movie is based off FOD, but perhaps the star was inspired by Field of Dreams and acted accordingly.Now ignoring that silly point, I loved this movie.  The Texas scenes are a bit sluggish, but the rest of the movie makes up for it.  It could be said that it's a happy and joyful tear-jerker.  So I would highly recommend this film.  I keep telling myself.... Meg Ryan left this guy?  Was she out of her mind?   Which is why I've lost some respect for Meg and gained some for Dennis.The dvd is lacking a movie trailer. :(  and isn't too fancy. 9/10Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 9/10 Replayable: 8/10",9,0,0,4 September 2002
Memento," Utterly Confusing, but in a good way.
","I kinda wish we knew what happened to Lenny.  The dvd gives us a few clues, but nothing else.SPOILERS?? (I leave this in every review I write cause I don't wanna worry whether or not I will write some.)I can't say I totally loved this movie.  But it is a great marvel at film making.  It reminds me of Being John Malkovich.  Although BJM I really don't like, though it is a good film.  Do I recommend watching it?  Yes I do. However, people who've never heard of it might be a little resistable on the idea of watching it.  I'm trying to get my dad to see it, but he's like most people (??)if they've never heard of it....it's not important enough to watch.When I first got into rating movies, I was like everyone else.  I was always peeved at critics cause they gave wacky reviews to odd movies.  That was 6 years ago.  I've changed.  I become more and more like those critics every day.  Because I've seen those odd movies nobody's heard of.  And 90% of the time they are off the wall creativity.So while watching Memento this was another creative movie.  However it is rather confusing.  And it's supposed to be confusing.  So my mind is just about as shucked up as Lenny's is now. o_OI've been reading how people disagree with the #10 showing.

So was a bit disappointed they painted Victor out to be the bad guy.  But Kate's supposed to be the renegade.  Should make for a wonderful sequel.And Kate certainly is hot in this movie.  Certainly nothing like Pearl Harbor.  (ie Pearl Harbor she didn't know what the heck she was doing.)Alot of movies though today (including this one) certainly enjoy providing clean cuts.  Resident Evil provided a black man being cut into squares and now we have a vampire getting his brain chopped clean.Anyway, I loved the movie.

But it doesn't.  But it's still a great movie. The credits says the characters are fictional, but the events are true. Wish they'd tell what part is true and what isn't.It's got a very good soundtrack.  Gonna have to find that one.  (score folks.  it's the score.

The 13th Warrior," Plot holes & miscasting spoil this great idea.
","(SPOILERS???) I really wanted to like this movie and I kinda do, but miscasting and a nagging plot hole ruined it.  The ending is bad because we don't know if he got the girl or not.  And seeing Antonio  (not ragging on Antonio) but him playing an arab was not the best of idea's.  Now Omar Sharif in his day back in Doctor Zhivago days woulda make this movie rock.I also found that The 13th Warrior made us feel...so what..so he's the 13th warrior, nothing special about him.  The movie fails to get us to care for antonia because he doesn't do anything.  No big c**kfighting nothing to rally the title of the movie.  The leader was the true star of the movie. the 13th warrior is just another extra in a movie.  He stands around looking pomposly arrogant.  He definately doesn't look arab.

Overall, this movie is begging for a sequel. It certainly better than 28 Days Later. But I failed to find the massive comedy everyone was talking about. Perhaps it's because it's more like Scream than Evil Dead 2. The latter evil dead movies are very hilarious. So that might have taken some of the punch out. But I liked it.

X-Men," Too Short and a water thin plotline.
","(contains spoilers.. beware)This movie was fun to watch.  But I came off of it feeling like there was about an hour to go.  It's something that irritated me.  This movie had the potential to go further, but they didn't.  104 minutes 9 of which they devote to credits.  If you view the DVD version it lets you add 10 minutes if you want.  But unlike many deleted scene's I've seen, these scenes at least some of them I'm glad they did delete because they didn't integrate too well into whatever plotline there was.  The plotline was so thin I coulda written it.  Lets see Magnito plans to turn us all into mutants. The ending sounds like a rip on X-Files.  Lock the bad guy in a plastic prison. They didn't really miscast anyone except my brother who is a X-Men purist whined about Paquin (Rogue) that Rogue should be in her 30's.  But how are legends created?  A little variant is needed from time to time.  Like William Wallace and bolts of lighting from his a*se.  It was nice to see Paquin (The Piano) again.  Looks to be the next Claire Danes at this rate. Jackman was beautifully cast.  Can't find a better man for the role of Wolverine.  Berry was fun as Storm.  That scene she had with the rather wet Senator was rather fun. But again this movie was too short.  All they really had was one plot and that was too thin of a plot.  You shouldn't be making a single comic book into a movie.  Combine a few of them will ya.  At least they got Judge Dredd right on that one. Rent/Buy the DVD obviously.  You can't watch these types of movies anymore on VHS because all the goodies have been sent to the DVD's.

Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Good but not as great and enduring as the original.
",Out of practice writing reviews since I just haven't had time to watch new movies. I'd watched Hellboy streaming and thought now was as good as any to finally watch my copy of Hellboy II. The movie itself on it's own is not bad. It's rather good with the entertainment and the blu ray sound is a kicker. But the one single thing that sinks this movie is plot holes. Everywhere to the point of making the movie senseless. :( The embarrassing beginning with Hellboy was ouch. Think I'll skip that part from now on. A lot of knife work that is rather good just seems out of place. I thought for sure abe woulda spilled the beans on Liz's pregnancy when he was rather drunk. Nope... Totally un needed scene. And oh don't stand by the window. Hellboy is out. Like yeah the whole big chase scene in the first movie was more obvious. That was really pushed in and created such a plot hole I kept expecting it to show up in the credits. Nope no easter eggs there. Face Palm. No I don't like Liz's new haircut or her fire color.

Sleepy Hollow," Oh my. What fun is this?
","Classic Tim Burton.  From the same dude who brought us beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands... Comes this fine little dandy.  I'd wanted to see this movie when it came out, but it ran into a little 007 trouble.  I'll always watch James Bond before anyone else even if Bond's quality rating could be more or less of this movie.  I pretty much loved this movie.  Christina Ricci was fun to watch in this movie.  I would consider this movie one of her best.  Johnny Depp is strange as usual.  He so looked his Edward Scissorhands best.  Some of the whigs in here are recognizable, and totally fun.  This was also classic Christopher Walken.  He was born to play roles like this.  It wouldn't be a horrific movie without him. ---POSSIBLE Spoilers:::::
Some points I didn't like was the very end of the movie.  I would have thought just cutting it after he faints woulda been fun.  Or ending the movie at sleepy hollow somewhere would have been fun.  As always, it's always tricky after changing the ending of a classic (ie The Scarlet Letter (demi moore)... which actually I didn't mind that change.  however The Crucible (Winona Ryder) didn't change the ending and it also did a good job.)I also thought having some idiot placing that idiotic flaming pumpkin scene was unnessessary.  Why have it?  It wasn't pertenent to the story.  I haven't ever read the book, but I just thought it distracting.I give this a 7 out of 10.  But very entertaining it was.",9,0,0,1 June 2000
We Were Soldiers," Horrible first 45 minutes, but after that you get the bite.
","I almost gave up on this movie during the first 45 minutes.  There is better ways to set up this movie than going thru crap.  So this movie cannot possibly get the full 10/10.(spoilers)??This movie was probably timed right, cause most in theory typically regard the vietnam war as a faux pax.  A mistake.  Simply put, you don't go into a major battle with one arm tied behind your back.  Which is why we pulled out.  Cause you can't win that way.This movie shows a little of this, but decides to go the patriotic rout. Which really isn't a bad thing for this movie.  Since this particular battle was won by someone who knew how to win.  But I though this was a little too much hollywood.  There are better vietnam movies than this.  That and sure the soundtrack was glossy, but inappropriate for a vietnam style movie.So if you like it, you'll like it, if you don't, maybe you should.

Ocean's Twelve," Hilarious Sequel. (loses focus now and then) But you hardly know it's a sequel.
","What I mean by that is... the story contains the same vibrant acting as the first one. Although I do think that at times it may have left the track and lost focus. Such as towards the beginning, but overall, I liked it about the same as the first one. Nothing detracts watching this film from watching the first. In fact I think I'll go play the first.Clearly George and Brad are having a great time. Love the scene towards the end with the baseball hat trick. They went all out in having fun. THe moment Brad puts the hat down. phewt George swipes it off the table and all hell breaks loose.Also I think the fact that Julia roberts character pretends to be Julia Roberts... has got to be a Hollywood first. Maybe I'm wrong, but not many movies where one gets to pretend to be oneself. Although I don't like Julia all that much. She was great in the first and she's pretty good in the second . (although for some reason her character isn't shown that much this time. ) And the lovely addition of Vincent Cassel (did I butcher his last name? lol) anyway, that was a great addition. Although I wish he'd play more good guy roles like Crimson Rivers (something was lost when he left Crimson Rivers 2) Jean Reno and Vincent had great Chemistry. He certainly was wicked in Elizabeth though.So I'll have to recommend this sequel to anyone who either enjoyed the first or is a new fan. :)7/10Quality: 9/10 (great camera work and editing) Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 7/10",7,1,1,8 May 2005

Blade II," Bizarre sequel. Not totally recommended.
","(spoilers)While watching the movie I will have to say it does hook you in right away. Problem is, it leaves this horrible aftertaste.  With the first movie it was more of a action movie than a horror movie.  This time it's more horror than action.  So if you liked the first movie, this movie might confuse you.I don't even consider it much of a sequel.  Just another Blade movie. It's totally bizarre.  With the first movie, it was almost believeable, but Blade 2 tip toes into the unreal realm.  Blade was about vampires.  Blade 2's vampire decendents look like something off of either Dark City or Alien.Biggest gripe is how utterly fake the CGI is.  (I haven't seen CGI this fake since Harry Potter) The first movie had great cgi, but in Blade 2 not only is the movement fake, but some of it isn't even finished.  When Blade litterally slices Ron Pearlman right down the middle, his glasses fall off before he begins to disappear.  He's got no eyes!!!As well as some of the plot coulda been written by a 13 year old on caffeine.5/10Quality: 2/10 Entertainment: 9/10 Replayable: 4/10",5,1,4,9 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Alot better than Phantom Menace, though it still lacks spirit.
","Spoilers???Phantom Menace isn't bad, but it wasn't that good either.  Since that time I began to lose interest in the series.  So it took me until the DVD to finally watch the Clones.One thing though, the name is off putting.  Since most of the movie has nothing to do with attacking clones. Certainly we hear about them and what have you,. but it isn't until the end of the movie that they suddenly show up.Natalie Portman is of course stunning.  Nothing wrong there.  Ewan (obe wan) continue's to impress me.  He'll make a fine Alec Guinness. The actor who play's Anikan does totally surprise me.  Though at times his acting is a bit weak, it portray's the character very well.Christopher Lee's in this.  But he's out of place I think.  He's a bit typecasted of late into being a certain bad wizard.  But maybe not.  I've liked Lee since The Man with The Golden Gun.  I do think they are carrying this cutting off body parts a bit too far. Certainly the kids are watching.  Certainly the removal of Luke's hand in 1980 was perhaps a shock.  But by the time we get to SW 2, it's gonna numb someone.  I think it's a bit overkill.  There's just no reason for it.Again this Star Wars movie lacks spirit.  Compared to the beloved 4,5,6. These movies don't show heartfelt emotion.  I dare say though, some of that spirit shows up in the last few minutes of the film.  With the clone army gathering.   (Glad to see Darth Sidious. That actor never ages!!)8/10

The only reason to watch the movie is because Charlize Theron is so beautiful in it.  But it's a so so movie.  I get the feeling that the original movie is alot better than this remake.  Nothing new is brought to the table here.  It's a fun to watch movie, though at times it begins to get boring.  I still wish Mark Walhberg would get into more movies.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Powerful Vision. But lacks any real emotion.
","(Spoilers??)This will be perhaps one of my harder reviews.I was and still am apprehensive (sp?) about watching LOTR in a film media. Sure I admit... I haven't read the book, but I have been intending to. Although I've taken about a year off from reading, I still remember worlds I haven't been to.  LOTR I haven't.  It would be of course a new world.  There are many though that I've imagined to be better than LOTR.  Such as The Death Gate Cycle (hence my email address).The problem of course is that I am a book reader & an avid movie watcher. So coming to this particular world is a trip yes, but it's not the strongest movie I've seen yet.  Perhaps this will change in The Two Towers & The Return of the King.  I do hope so.  I see this movie for what it is... a beginning.  Which is bound to get better.  I was brought up mostly on the tale of Bilbo Baggins.  So Frodo is totally new to me.  I kinda wished they'd done The Hobbit first.  But LOTR will do for now.Is this movie Oscar worthy?  That seems the biggest outcry right now.  I question this.  A Beautiful Mind is a very powerful movie.  One has to be open to this.  Is it better than LOTR?  This I cannot say.  In my view no movie is better than the other.  We all just happen to like certain movies. 
Should Ian of won supporting actor?  Can't say yet.  I have to see Iris. The awards shows nowadays is kinda like Soap Opera awards.  You all have a favourite soap.  You wish that one particular performance would win.  But usually it doesn't.  Hence LOTR.  So to the outsider, do I recommend this movie.  Oh yes.  indeed.  But Perhaps you should wait for all three to come out first.To the LOTR fan.  If your a book nut, perhaps be ready for a slight letdown. (that silly ending doesn't help)  But if your an LOTR nut period.... if you haven't watched it yet... someone's gonna get kicked. ;)My only problem I really had in this near flawless movie was the fact that it's emotionally cold.  You pretty much know the wizard's not really dead.

I get the feeling Neo isn't really dead.  He might be part of the program now.  Which would be why the Oracle tells the little girl we'll be seeing him again.But it is these questions that hang that don't help.  I can only assume someone planned another movie.  Since the movie really doesn't end.  Maybe with different characters I don't know, but Matrix 3 really doesn't end.The movie overall is pretty good, that is , standing alone.  Tons of action. Lots of fun.  However it's starting to steal alot from Terminator.    So in the matter of the entire series, this is probably the worst.  I enjoyed Matrix 2, but the series probably should have remained The Matrix.  Or at least 1 sequel.  As you can tell I have mixed emotions over this movie.  I can see where they were going with it, but, they leave too many questions at the end of the movie without explainations.  My big one...  how can Neo see without eyes. Thats never explained at all.So in a certain sense I'm disappointed.  But I thought it was a great film. Confused.?

Andrian Brody plays an odd sort of crazy murderer. But overall, the movie is way too short and too thin in the plot to make it completely satisfying. I do like where they are living though. Maybe I can rent one of those out and relax for a week. Gotta get that score.I don't like some of the mixing and matching with the editing in the middle of the movie. Maybe that's Night's thing.

","Whereas the second part contains all the action thus almost no substance, and skips around , totally chaotic wants to get done faster than it should. This one was much better off. Yes there is more dialogue but that was to be expected, it's a long book. It didn't rush things, and added some humor to it now and then. Not entirely sure why the second one gets better ratings. I assume people prefer action over substance. The only real substance in part 2 is Snape's end.. other than that , part 2 is way too short. Totally missed the great elf uprising. Like someone hit panic after the end of this movie. Think Peter Jackson did it better splitting 2 movies into 3 on which it's based on a single tiny book and still made it worth while. (Hobbit) So of the two I prefer this one. Maybe this will change with time but the last movie is so utterly confusing I'd rather read the book again. And probably makes zero sense to those who haven't.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Better than expected. Lots of action, but hardly any plot.
","(Spoilers)Well I did notice one thing that stands out in this movie.  We screwed.  All the other movies had a shred of hope.  This one admits defeat.  Which is unfortunate.  I thought the movie was okay, it the 100 some minutes fly by.  But then again T3 is horribly short.  (with the t2 special edition running over 150 minutes long)There are some odd timeline mistakes.  John Conner is quoted as saying at the beginning they attacked him when he was 13.  Ouch.  Thats gotta hurt. If you watch T2 Robert Patricks keys John's name into the cop car's computer and it clearly states he was born in 1985.  And that he was 10 years old. Even on the disc 2 of T3 it says 1995.  So I assume that T3 takes place between 2005-2010.  Which doesn't seem like the time it's supposed to be in. And why use The Blue Man Group for the credit song.  Hey they are weird, but only on video.  So so as music.I was a bit peeved they had to kill Sarah Connor off.  There wasn't alot of reason to do this.  Musta been awfully young for what got her. 
Other pet peeves.  Whats up with coloring the Terminator's teeth?  They used to be the color of metal.  They are white now.  Alot of the future scenes were poorly done.  With horrible cgi fakery.  I like T1 and T2.  T3 is okay, but nowhere near the first two.  But probably a keeper.

","Might have spoilers:I had this movie sitting around a 9 star until I hit the end of the movie. The ending was a bit of a letdown.  So I gave it a 7.  But it's a very good movie action wise.  Some people like to compare this to Das Boot.  There is no comparison really.  The two movies have different directions and I don't wanna compare the two.  While Das Boot is going after ethics, U-571 is going after an encoder.  However there are times in this movie where (like Hunt for red october)that I doubt this scenes for the sub were shot under water.

The Alamo," Movie seems like it was thrown together.
","Not kidding, it was like.. okay.. what do we do next? Oh hey I know. Lets make a movie about The Alamo. And then they threw it together and we've got a movie. Problem is, if you want a movie that does a decent job at showing what really happened at the Alamo... this isn't one of those movie. Plot holes everywhere. From Santa Anna's girl. and why is she scared (deleted scenes on the DVD indicate she was his second wife) to Sam directing one of the main soldier's here to go burn a bridge yet no bridge is displayed in the movie. TO the ridiculously short ending. Then they throw the ending of the movie per se to the front of the movie. So by the time you get to the ending.... your left to wonder what happened. So if this movie doesn't leave you totally confused, your lucky. Because that's what it did to me. And Billy Bob Thorton as Crockett??? Although he didn't butcher the part, he sure as heck ain't no John Wayne.For the most part I think they thought like a 4 hour movie, wanted to show all these different story lines.. Were too giddy for their own good and rushed the storyline. Which is a complete disaster. One of the biggest disappointments I've seen in a long time.

And appreciate the excitement over this movie.  But I fail to see where everyone can just give it a 10/10. It certainly can't get any awards for being a quality film.   The plot is a bit fuzzy.  The editing work is rather poor.  The acting is pretty good, but the costume for Williams Dafoe is idiotic.  Alot of the CGI work is extremely fake.They didn't do much in way of production values for the dvd.  It's design in both technical and layout was created by a drunk.  With absolutely no hint on how to design a good menu system.  It does have a good share of easter eggs.  The CGI bloopers provide about a minute of laughs.  But the other 2 minutes are filler crap.  Shrek's CGI bloopers are better.The majority of my 6/10 rating comes from the last 20 minutes of the movie.A majority of plot items are left explained.  Who made his nice gettup? You don't go from a moronic costume to this awesome suit without some sort of inspiration.And the idiots at Columbia/tri star failed to respect Stan Lee (the creator of Spider Man).

Dead format. Can I have it on laserdisc while your at it?) The movie basically runs sorta like a Soap Opera does. with the LOTR/Hobbit style editing that I was never really fond of. Okay everything seems to happen at once. But basically this was an action movie. Not much acting required here. Takes the action scenes out of Pearl Harbor deletes the fluff and well everyone follow Ben. I do appreciate the fact that more film makers are creating films with less CGI in them (as the CGI looks dated 10 years from now anyway. Like Harry Potter 2 was bad when it came out , but the story was better.... It's hard to tell if this is a fictional piece or non fictional. It has that Titanic feel to it and we've been here before. Just not the best editing and same old type of film which might be because it's the lack of CGI but why it's rated higher than Darkest Hour I haven't the foggiest. There's no acting in the film. yeah it's an action movie and I gave it a good rating but I think the way it was edited it was to hide the huge plot holes within the movie and confuse people about it.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Missing it's magic. But not a total wash.
","Well clearly Richard Harris is to be totally missed. He came across as a more sincere Albus. Michael Gambon is good at one thing. Being a bad guy. I can't trust Albus now. Not totally. Now not that Michael isn't a good actor. He's very good when he plays less than goodie tushu characters. He's perfect in Open Range. And not that Richard Harris never played bad guys. But Richard was a far better actor. He was convincing at a bad or good guy. I just can't help but wonder if there could have been a better choice. I suppose Ian Mckellen was taken. But the similarities in Potter 3 to LOTR are matched in more than just actors. So he could have been a great albus. I can't believe how much their ghosts/guards... whatever look like LOTR's Ring Wraiths. No creativity here. Certainly the CGI has massively improved here, but so much so they may have forgotten the characters themselves. I'm not gonna go on a blistering attack on the movie. It's hardly a letdown. But I'm not gonna swoon over it like the first two films. I just hope they get their act together. Because Potter 3 is missing the fun. Wonder if Chris Columbus will ever come back. It was good to see Gary Oldman again. I don't see him in many films of the type he did in the 90's. And he's hardly recognizable in Hannibal.

The Fast and the Furious," Rather dull ending for a fast running movie.
","spoilers?I liked this movie.  But it has some serious flaws that may disgust some viewers.  The biggest notable item is the lack of an ending.  It's like they wrote the movie and they didn't know how to end it.  They kinda wrote themselves into a corner.  And it's never really known why the bad guys were bad guys, or why some triads were shot or killed.  Perhaps I should say the plot is very vague.What I had problems with is again this fear of the R rating.  They even explain this in some of the making of parts on the dvd.  Their reason for wanting a PG-13 is to get the kids to watch this movie.  It's really sad when the movie creators have to tone down a great movie because they want to get a certain rating.  They did that with Eyes Wide Shut so it wouldn't get the so called Dreaded NC-17 rating.  Why is it that American films are so scared of pi**ing people off?  Lolita was a great hit outside this country, but was practically banned in America.  So much for that first amendment.

Sure I know there's a form of racisim in every race, but did we have to end the movie in such a way.  Maybe it's because of all the stupid school shootings in american today.Frankly when I was young, I felt a little racist.  But I fortunately grew out of that.  Hate as they say in the movie is no way to live. Sure I don't want to deny them their free speech, but once it gets violent, then thats entirely different.

Sure the star power is excellent, but there isn't alot of back story on it.  Just before the robbery the story almost falls off the earth.  It's like it was okay for awhile and then it got really weak and boom  kewl.  And it also has a confusing ending.Then of course you've got that nimrod Julia Roberts who doesn't act.

I did find that it ripped on several japanimation ideas before it, but alot of japanimation is like that.  I generally disagree that this movie should be placed so high on the top 250 (48) There's several that are so much better.

","This movie I just knew I'd hate.  And guess what...  I did. Sorta.
(spoilers??) Most certainly the love story was rediculously stupid.  It was poorly written and utterly insane.  Here we are trying to aim our frustrations at the Japanese and we're waring over a girlfriend.The battle was very well done.  But not perfect.  They really should have devoted more time to Pearl Harbor than what they ended up with.  And I'm fairly certain the hunks didn't always get the girl.My problem though is with Disney.  They're idea's are in the right place, but their heart is in the money.  I've got nothing bad to say about the japanese, but why are we curbing history just to make them happy?  It's all about the money.  I can imagine the people who died at Pearl are rolling about their graves knowing that we are pandering to the Japs a movie about them that should show them in bad light but doesn't.  What they did then was very cowardly.  And just because they've kissed and made up doesn't change history.  Disney I guess is in the buisness to either change history or forget history.  And what is this hint about American suicide pilots?The dvd is poorly done.  (this is on the 2 disc set, not the new rated R directors cut)  It was I would assume rushed together.  I can't figure out why they put 183 minutes over two dvds, when Titanic did 193 on one. It's utterly annoying.  Sure I can imagine Das Boot being on two discs, but unless it's Superbit...  I'd rather have it all on one.6/10   (which is all for the battle)Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 6/10 Replayable: 7/10",6,0,1,6 July 2002
Resident Evil," Unoriginal by far. But a surprisingly good adaption of videogame.
","Biggest problem of course is... it's based off a video game.  Which has good excuse to borrow ideas from others. Not to mention... there's like this skip forward.  So your scratching your head trying to figure out how this one dude and Milla got back to the main group.  o_O  Had to backup the dvd and still can't figure it out.Two things come to mind when watching the movie however.  Evil Dead & The Stand.  Combine those two things together and what have you got?(SPOILER)One thing though I can't get past.  As usual, Milla provides a rather wooden & Stiff portrayal of her character.  Now perhaps fits this particular character, but not always (The Messenger). Michelle Rodrigez is pretty damn good in this movie though. We've got to get her into more movies.And of course this movie, like the X-Men was built as a vehicle.  It's more than obvious that this movie is set up in such a way that a sequel can't be that far away.  Though I really can't figure out why. lol(Which as I see here....

","(spoilers)I must admit, I'm interested in this piece of history and thats why I watch this.  This is not your average Roman Polanski film.  He's a great director, but he finally directed something that everyone loves. 
The movie itself is not a tear jerker.  I doubt one tear dropped my eyes.The movie I don't think is set up to be a tear jerker.  But it is numbing. Being numb and shocked kinda screw a person up.The movie seems quite real.  Circling around the experiences of this pianist.  It's rather subtle in it's approach.  It slowly gets you hooked and when it does, the jewish world goes to hell in poland.There was one gap in the storyline I couldn't figure out and that was the lack of information as to what happened to his girlfriend.  It says she was captured.  But she disappeared into the background.

Course I know some Bond fans might have a fit, but I'm one of them and I'm not having a fit.The plot is a bit silly, but the amount of action and explosions and kicking the bad guys and going thru doors simply makes you forget that.  This up and coming star is really impressing me.  One thing I don't get, does he have a shirt fetish?  He seems to love taking his shirt off.  This happens 4-5 times throughout the movie.  Especially interesting was the grease scene.  This movie has some humor infused into the movie, and this is a fine example.If you love 'leave your brain at the door' type movies, you'll love this one.

Seabiscuit," Doesn't Engage the viewer!
","(spoilers??)I was extremely disappointed in this movie.  It really looked like it was supposed to be a good movie.  Sport movies are supposed to be pretty darn good.  Seabiscuit fails on many levels, but the worse is knowledge. 
What I mean is.. This movie is very harsh on outsiders.  I'm an outsider.  I don't know much about horse races.  Let alone Seabiscuit.  The movie assumes too much.  It assumes I know everything to do with Seabiscuit and Red Pollard.  So I can fill in the blanks.  A major plot hole is...  this girlfirend of Jeff Bridges.  is she his wife or is a year round girlfriend. The movie jumps around and seems very rushed.  Even though it runs at 140 minutes, it's poorly paced.  It spends too much time on dialogue and not enough time on building the drama that such a movie needs.Most of my time was spent looking at my watch.  Because it didn't engage me, it kept losing my interest.  I'd hit pause quite a few times.It makes poor use of the widescreen image , especially in Red's accident. 
In the end, yes it's a beautiful picture, but way too many things wrong with it to be much good.  Shiny, but mostly fluff.5/10Quality: 8/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Replayable: 2/10",5,0,3,10 February 2004

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Poor character development & emotionless dialogue create disappointment
","(spoilers)I love the book and Fellowship of the ring was fairly good.  There was one thing wrong with it and that was there was no emotion to the movie.  As if they were following a script and said ho hum.  When Gandalf fell, there was no emotion.  When another dude died after that I felt nothing.They failed to correct this in The Two Towers.  And whats worse is that it's all battle scenes.  Only a few characters in this movie. No character development.  In every Star Wars movie, there's been character development. So for some reason Peter Jackson decided that all the character development was done in the Fellowship.  It doesn't work that way.Another problem.  Special Effects.  What special effects?  The trees look like they came out of the Neverending Story.  And that was almost 20 years ago.Yeah of course the battle scenes are probably totally computer animated, I'm not griping about those.  I just think this movie fails to deliever.  I certainly hope Return of the King is much better than this.My recommendation, go read the book.

Driven," Fun to watch. If your a race fan that is.
","(spoilers?)I see good points and bad points in this movie.  First the bad.  Outsiders and people who don't know much about Formula One racing and their ilk might not get the lingo. (Trust me, I consider myself an outsider but know enough about racing to get drawn into the movie.)  Outsiders probably will shun this movie and shut it off before it hits the end of the movie.  It'll totally bounce off their brains.  Probably why this movie got so poor movie reviews is because critics aren't racing fans.  It has the edge, but perhaps it's that edge they don't like.Second, Gina Gershon (sp?) for some reason wasn't made for this role.  She just totally sucked in it.  She's been great in other movies like Bound and especially The Insider.  But she's too snobby for her own good in this movie.  She doesn't play the part of an a**hole very well.  Sure she was an a**hole in The Insider but for some reason she pulled it off there.Third, some of the car accidents looked a tad overdone.  
Now for the good.  The dvd is totally rad.  51 minutes of deleted scene's. With Stallone commenting.  Who the hell can top that?  This is a speed movie it'll catch you if your into that type of thing.Recognizing actors in here was fun to.  Including the youngsters brother. Knew him straightway from Dead Poets Society.  The enemy (for awhile  :) played a Replacement Killer in The Replacement Killers. The actress who played Sophie looks alot like Jennifer Connelly.  Not kidding.  You compare them and you'd swear they were twins. :)  Not that that's a bad thing.In the end, I like this movie enough to buy it.  (haven't yet, but wait a few months and we'll see).

Shrek the Third," Is it one too many?
","I've read a number of complaints that it's simply getting long in the tooth.Sure it's story isn't intricate as the first movie. But I found it much more hilarious than the second which was too much a parody of just about everything. Yes the third does parody, but touches the heart of the first movie that the second one completely missed. I loved it and compared to The Simpsons, (which got long in the tooth about 7 years prior to the movie) Shrek is no where near long in the tooth. Even by the promised 5th movie could I see wanting this series to end. I've come to love the characters and it was a bit of a cheer up with all thats going on personally. One confusion that makes it a bit complicated is having the hero named Arthur. So is this the real Arthur?

","(spoilers?)Two rather stark points prevented me from giving it a full 10/10.I was surprised by this movie.  As little as it made in the box office, I didn't expect much.  So it went above my expectations.  But just to a point.Makeup is good, pretty much everything is without complaint.  Harrison Ford acts very good, but he was miscast.  He's no russian.  The actor playing the russian president in sum of all fears would have done a better job.A good portion of the crew isn't Russian enough.  Liam Neeson easily passes for one.  But not Harrison.The movie is also rather depressing.  Not the type of movie to watch on a good day.

I do note though I was going to give it a 10 but something bugs me in whomever it was that edited the movie and tended to distract the attention away.  At times, some of the clips had a black bar at the top.  If yer gonna do a pan and scan version of the film (p/s sux in my opinion but besides DVD where else do I find widescreen at a rental store) please do it right.  There's no excuse for this c**p.

While not perfect, Sam Neill is the master in this movie.

The story is a bit of a mish mash though and thats why I can't give it a full 10 even if I wanted to.  It's utterly confusing mud.  It has some good music.  But the movie is sorely lacking in details.  It's also very obvious that this movie should never have been split.  Miramax made a greedy move by splitting them.  I haven't seen Volume 2. I sure as hell hope they join these films back together someday on dvd or hdvd.

Mission: Impossible II," One of those rare movies that kicks better butt than it's predecessor
","I'll admit I was skeptical about this movie at first.  And in fact it took until today to finally watch it.  I was one of the minority I guess that thought the first one had a great plot.  I still like the first one.  But the sequel is a wee bit more Bondish than the first.  I however did find Anthony Hopkins a bit out of place.  I had assumed ....  Eugene Kittridge would be the head boss now.  But that was not to be.The first half hour of the movie is rather slow, and it takes about 24 minutes to get to any main characters. One suggestion... don't watch this on video.  It would be better on DVD with a stereo hooked up to it.It has John Woo's unique slow motion shots throughout and does get annoying I suppose, but I liked it.  They don't really have the tearjerker type thingy going on like the first.  (SPOILER...... to the first one included)which as everyone knows Emilio gets his rather abruptly as well as everyone else.  and Claire as well in the end.The good guys body count is much better here.    Dougray Scott I've seen twice before.  First as a rather wimpy camera man in Deep Impact and then as a kewl good guy in Ever After.  I will admit, I much prefer Mr. Scott in Ever After than to MI 2 but Woo made him into an excellent villain here.I am disappointed that the end of the movie contained some rather unoriginal music.  I'd heard it in The Rock and my dad was telling me before I watched the movie that it originally came from a Bud commercial.  Stick the music where it should be will yah..  Don't recycle it.  Other than that I loved the score.....  get the DVD 10/10",10,1,2,15 December 2000
Black Hawk Down," Not perfect. Not bad. And rather emotionless.
","(Spoilers?)I'm a believer in online rentals.  And the timing was right for this movie. They shipped it a day before it came out.  Course I got it on the 14th. About 3 days after it came out.  So this thing was brand new.I didn't know what to expect from this movie.  Heck, I own Gladiator but have not watched it all yet.  So here sits this movie.  It's a little too modern I think.  But it's okay I guess.  I do think though that it's a little too military for some folks.  I've never been in the military so some of the lingo is beyond my reach.  Rules of Engagement is better than this. 
I think Ridley was more interested in showing the utter gore of battle than anything with emotion in this movie.  With a guy known for Gladiator ( a movie that'll have you tearing up in no time) this movie is a disappointment as far as showing any kind of real emotion in this movie.  I found the actors to be nothing more than cold rocks.  It was rather hard for me to care about anyone dying in this movie.  Ewan Mcgregors piece was useless. I'm not totally certain that filming a movie with a bunch of unknowns was the best idea.  There's one thing with Tom Hanks dies in Saving Private Ryan and quite a different thing when an unknown does.  With all the body parts falling in this movie... I actually don't remember anyone who actually died in the movie. The dvd is also rather skimpy on extra's.  There is a 25 min making of though that should suffice.  I also was disheartened that they did not include Country in Sam Shephards list of credits.  That's a great movie that's slowly slipping into the past :(The good things in this movie.  I think this movie was very well shot.  It seemed rather realistic.   I gave this movie an 8 simply because I did feel they accomplished  a great deal.  Although I thought the ending was rather sub par.  It is rather hard to read the text at the end of the movie.  I'd say anyone with a tv under 32 in, might not be able to read it.  If you don't... you'll never find out what happened to Michael Durant. 
I do feel that this is a little bit of a fad movie.  There is alot of patriotism going on now.  But patriotism can sour really fast.  So I'm not sure how long it'll be before we see anti war movies again.8/10Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable:  depends   5/10",8,0,1,16 June 2002
The Insider," One of the best movies ever made.
","I'd say by the time this movie finished, my eyes were wet.  Whatever the facts are, this movie does a good job in pointing out the fact that when businesses own a news media, the news becomes biased.  This is where free press is blurred.  I had heard of the 60 minutes screw up in the Tv Guide years ago, but I didn't know the facts.  This movie makes you want to know more.  When this movie first came out I bi**hed only because Disney didn't let sixty minutes review it.  That's the only reason and I never let on to the fact that just because I bi**hed it didn't mean I wouldn't like the movie.  Anyone who wants to see a good movie like this should see it.  My favourite part of the movie though is the contrast at the beginning where it would seem it's easier to protect a terrorist than it is of big tobacco.  10 out of 10",10,0,1,26 April 2000

I'm disappointed though that we didn't find out what happened to her character.  This is more of a case that the book is better than the movie.  Haven't read the book, but in the deleted scene's, it makes it seem that the book is better.  But it isn't that bad of a movie.

The Mummy Returns," Fun to watch, but isn't that much original.
","This movie was a slight bit of a let down.  However it was a good sequel to the first Mummy.(SPOILERS possible)minuses Biggest problem is it's homage to the first movie.  Meaning the stupid lets parody the first movie.  Both  Beastmaster and Scream love to do that.  But I think it ruin's some of the fun in this movie.  Whereas it may have been fun (and still is) in the first movie.  This movie it's like, quit wasting are time already. There's also some question in the script writer when O'Connell says this line as they see Imhotep being raised from the dead.  (or something like that) 'You know, if I saw that a couple of years ago, I wouldn't have believed it.'  For some reason I believe 9 some years past.  That couldn't possibly a couple of years.  Oh sure a couple of years ago in our time sure, but it ain't 9 years. O'Connell pretty much is funny as usual. Anck Su Namun is a little more of a b**ch in this movie.  I liked her in the first. Oh mr Mummy/Imhotep is still the victim, tho more of Anck Su Namun than anybody else as she leaves him to die.  Nevermind herself. The Rock is a publicity stunt for the movie The Scorpion King.  He's like barely in here, says less lines than Arnold did in Terminator and was only on for less than 4 min.  Unless you count that crude computer designed Rock-Scorpion creature at the end. And while I still love Evelin, she's become fun loving librarian to miss wonder-bra woman who can kick butt.  Of the two if I'd first seen her, I'd take Miss Librarian any day.  Simply because I love books. And the movie has a little of that rushed lets push the director to get this done feel to it.  (Whats it about May??? anyway?)Now the plusses. Believe me the plusses far outweight the minnuses.  If I've misspelled anything, it's only in rush btw. ;) It's the damn action that got me.  I loved it.  I loved seeing mummies in London.  That was my favourite part.  That Imhotep (Arnold Voosloo) had more screen time.  (Hmmm  great two arnolds in the same review.. oopsy) Some of the movie gets more of that Indiana Jones feel. (not the dog) If you like big grand scene's, you'll love it.  And the little one just has a field day now doesn't he.In the end,  I like the first movie better.  It had a good mix of action and humor.  It's only fault was too much humor. Mummy Returns was the exact opposite.  In that it had too much action to humor mix.  I just hope that on Mummy 3  (not Scorpion King) and if there is one, that they finally find a good formula for this.Cause it was the most fun I've had since Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade.8/10(new thing I'm trying.

The Last Samurai," Fiction for movie sake.
","(spoilers)While Titanic certainly encouraged the idea.  (fiction stories within real events)  The Last Samurai doesn't do this quite so well.  Not that this is a bad thing.  As the movie is so well made you leave the theater wondering if it was a true story or not.  And it's very hard to find out if it's a work of fiction.  It is.  But it's inspired by legend.  On it's own the movie is a wonderful treat.  I say this without having seen Master and Commander yet. But so far this one takes the cake.  (unless I'm talking Whale Rider of course.  no movie will ever touch that one.  It's what I call a perfect movie.  nothings wrong with it.)  I think this movie is Tom's best since Far & Away.  It's been awhile since then and he needed one.  I might not agree with him on many occasions, but I've always enjoyed his acting.

","Trust me... this will of course ruin the movie if you read on.  Course I thought it was disappointing anyway.The whole comment above would read, Pretty good movie up until that cruel twist.We watched this in film class.  And I will admit that I'd been wanting to see this for quite awhile.  The fact is, I found it to be one of the most disappointing movies of all time.  I've seen my fair share of movies, and I'd thought this to be a family movie.  But it really isn't.  It lures you cruely into thinking it's a romantic comedy underlined with the Holocaust. The teacher said this is a good tear jerker.  Almost 5 days later, I'm still in disbelief that he was shot to death.  I had no time to cry over it.  It says at the end..  this is the sacrifice that my father made.  Yeah...  he was more stupider than Ernest P Worrel.  (nevermind)I figured as they were writing.. they decided to kill someone off for fun. To show that the Holocaust wasn't a fairy tale.  It sure was a poor way of doing it.  There's alot of tragic movies out there that are better than this.  Braveheart, The English Patient, Titanic.  Hell.. Face/Off...  what else?? Hmmm.. oh wait... This is a silly reference.. Mortal Kombat 2. Johnny Cage is killed.  WTF??I do realize that alot of people like this movie.  That's great.  I'm glad they liked it.  But I didn't.  I'll probably never watch this movie again. (watch it in italian) I will admit however that the best actor nod was probably dead on.  And it's not like this is a poor quality show, I just figure that this guy had no brains.

Being a fan of Geoffery Rush, since Les Miserables, I'd always wanted to watch this movie.  It wasn't what I was expecting, but no harm done.  He portrays the character like everything else he does.  With a great sense of realism.  He's not Geoffery Rush, he's David.  I simply loved it.Now some things Id like to hit out on.  First, the casting.  The family seems poorly cast.  Now Mr. Stahl is great and wonderful, but he was around 65 at the time of the shooting of this movie.  Much too old for the part. The actress playing the mother was just right, but when David was much older, she wasn't a day older.Not much was played on his schizophrenia.  The bed scene seemed like inspiration for Beautiful Mind.  It might be because they wanted to focus more on his piano playing than his illness.

Well April 19th I finally went to see the movie.  I went in thinking maybe 2 1/2 -3 star and came out emotionally spent.  I'm a guy and when a movie hits you that hard, I end up liking the movie so much.  What really made this movie worked was James Horner's score.  Only he could have done it.

I do like reading about Titanic's history.  I like to take photographs, seeing old photographs makes the feeling the more real.   Contrary to many people, I think Kate Winslet is the star of the show and not Leo.  He's almost a non issue except that if not because of Leo, Kate would be wandering about God only know where or dead already. I hope Kate Winslet gets some movies worth her talent.  I know Leo's Man behind the Iron Mask was less than expected. So he's not perfect either. When I watch a movie I try very hard not to think about the politics of a movie.  Want a good way to ruin a movie, that's a good way how.  It's hard to believe that someone who completely hated the movie decided to see it. (which is dumb anyway. you can't complain until you see it, then you have every right to.)  This is only the second time since I began watching movies that my opinions about a movie have changed so dramatically.  The other was the highly controversial movie Last Temptation of Christ. (for which for over 5 years I refused to watch it.)  Well I better quiet down , and go back to reviewing movies just for friends..... it's a hobby of mine.. (this wasn't a true review anyway.  just defending against some of the comments I've seen so far on this page. thank you.)",9,2,5,7 September 1998
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Fully realized world. But does contain some flawed cgi.
","Now I'm not the sort of hateful guy that looks at such a movie and cries foul.  I suppose if the Catholics can have corrupted priests...  us Christians can have Nazi supported book burnings.  What.. are we paranoid of this?   Lemme guess..  they're gonna go apeskip over Halloween.I like magic.  Kinda wish the Death Gate Cycle was made into a movie. (hence my email address name) But I'm afraid that'll be rated R. Imagine Merlin without his magic?  Are we so concerned about our children that we deny them the right to read?I've never truly been into Harry Potter.  But I have been interested.  I love to read books.  Though I'm in a bit of a lull at the moment.  But anyone who can get the young ones to read an 800 page book definatly gets my attention.   I wasn't sure about watching the movie until a certain fool decided it was book burning time.  These of course are the same folks who advocate murdering abortion doctors.  Which is worse?  Reading about fantasy or actually committing the act?Well enough political crap.  I loved the movie.  It was very well done. While I've never read a book, this had amazing use of CGI.  However.. some of the fight scenes looked very fake.  And I found it funny that a 152 minute movie made use of it's time so wisely.  I didn't find anything boring about it.  It's a movie that I think any age would love. (unless your one of those unmentionables above.. I never thought it was our right at Christians to hate and judge people.  But I guess thats what happens sometimes.)

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Not bad, but some glaring plot holes made it less than perfect.
","I assume they left the plot holes in purposely so I gotta go read the book.The first one I actually thought was a skip on the DVD. After the ball and Ms Granger is having a tearful argument with Ron about he ruined everything. Did I miss something? Clearly time flew as Ms Granger had been wondering where Harry had been. She just left him and ron sitting around depressed at a table. THat was like just a glaring plot hole. The other.. well after all that I assume Harry won the goblet of fire.After all that though clearly our three friends are kids anymore. I just hope these three at least remain till the 7 movies are up. (which is probably the reason Peter Jackson did what he did with LOTR. However Harry Potter's world needs some aging. But if Melissa Joan Hart can pull off being a teen into her mid to late 20's, these three oughta make it easy. Definitely bring back the director though. He did a much better job than the other one in movie 3. The movie pretty much has that emotion thing down... although I admit freely that Ron really looks bad in that dress of his. I had to hit the FF on the remote. (similar situation happens in movie 2 with the cake over the guests. :P I am disappointed with WB home video from the way they released the DVD. The Standard DVD looks like the first 3 except it's only got one disc. I really had to hunt down the double disc special edition. I let them know my disappointment. It was a stretch when they switched the nice cardboard/plastic custom DVD case to the plastic one's everyone else uses, but hey if LOTR special editions came in the plastic type, they'd never be as cool. Now they've shredded the second disc.7/10Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10and kill that rat!!! (cause he's certainly up to no good)",7,0,0,11 March 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Missing it's soul.
","(Spoilers??)The first movie had depth.  And it was original.  And it was memorable.This second movie here has none of those.  And will easily be forgetable. While it has been fun getting to see what happened from 1999-2003, the movie is more about showing orgy's than being concerned with poor Smith.  It's a bit sad because 2 and 3 could have easily been done better and put into one movie.  Warner Brothers simply got carried away.Sure I like the film.  But it's no where near like the first one and because some of our characters are missing from the first movie, there's a big gaping hole between them.  It's also a bit of a bore at times.  Bogged down by discussions and thought. Ick!

Mystic River," Okay. But not one of Eastwood's best.
","(spoilers!)While I did find the deceptive twist in this movie interesting. Overall the movie is same IL same IL. Nothing new retread. Guess this should have been obvious by the stupid DVD release trick. No extra's on one and the hard to find 3 disc set is the only other option. Now I'm being really generous by giving this movie a 7. Simply because there's nothing wrong with the movie in a certain sense. But it's unoriginal. I didn't find Sean Penn to be overly great. Although better than his reputation has allowed. He was a lot better in 21 Grams. Much better script to work with. I was impressed with a lot of performances in 21 grams. (except the title.)Tim Robbins was okay, Kevin Bacon was a bit too much of a statue.But it was a mostly dragged out movie with a very good last half hour. Which is probably why I'm so generous. I say deceptive because looking at the ending is confusing. (via the cheat method. look at the ending first) At one point thru the cheat method it became obvious to me at the time that Tim Robbins did it. But watching the movie right, this was not the case. Frankly that wife of his, though playing a sympathetic person.. got her husband killed. The very end though I found to be wrapped up way to fast. I found it amazing that this movie got the attention that it did. Perhaps because it was a Clint Eastwood direction. Everyone's eyes glazed over. To me his best movie, though not my favourite is Bridges of Madison County.7/10Quality: 8/10 Entertainment: 4/10 Replayable: 2/10",7,0,1,28 August 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," A must for every year!!
","This is the movie to watch the night before Christmas.  Watch it on DVD if you must, watch it on VHS if you must, but it's just not the same on TV. It's hypocritical to use the term.  W/O commercials that would be nice, but not with em in the middle.I have watched this movie every year since I can remember.  Dads got the colorized version that Stewart hated so much (I don't like it either) I found my mom a copy of the b/w version with a free christmas ball to put on the tree a few years ago.  Last year I got a copy and and this year I bought the DVD version.  Either way, when this movie first came out it's amazing people didn't see it for what it was.  A masterpiece!!!  It wouldn't be Christmas to me without having watched it the night before.",10,1,3,23 December 2000
Enemy at the Gates," Very good movie with flaws.
","I really thought Rachel Weisz shined in this movie.  She's a great actor and is improving all the time.  She impressed me greatly. However, the flaw here is that none of the main characters have any german or russian accents.  I knocked 2 stars off from 10 for that.  It's believability factor isn't so great.  But in the end, it's the Titanic sequel we've been looking for.  Perhaps this movie is the reason Pearl Harbor did so poorly.

A Beautiful Mind," Wonderful movie. Presents mental illness with light at the end of the tunnel.
","I loved this movie.  While I am giving it a 9/10, that doesn't mean too much as far as whether you should see it or not.  It's a must watch.  I'm giving it a slightly lowered rating for some sketchy acting from our two main stars.  It's nothing really wrong with how they act per se. But...Spoilers???1.  I found Russells punch at the end of the movie lacking in any emotional depth.  Perhaps this was due to the screenplay. 2.  I also found (and I like Jennifer alot) Jenn's emotional scene's with Russell seem's a little forced.  Jennifer did really well in Requiem For A Dream.  I wish she'd carry a little of that into her other roles.  Or perhaps it's because Crowe's a better actor than Jennifer.  So much so that perhaps it shows.But really, all that doesn't matter much to me as I loved the movie.  I knew Ed Harris wasn't real, but Paul Bettany's character (he was great in A Knights Tale.

It's like, hey, don't end now.  I was having fun.  The entertainment in this movie is off the scale and I think this is why people love it.  I loved to poke fun at Harry originally.  (when it was just a book)  But after having religious fantatics crying foul, I had to go for it.  So now I own all the books, the first movie and now I've watched this one.

But I was surprised that I was a bit entertained by it.I was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had.  (even less without the credits)  And the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature.  But alas, they torture him.  Right until the end of the movie.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Certainly on par with the first and second episodes.
","Just watched this today and still getting over it. Although I wouldn't call it a tear jerker just yet, the movie does leave one rather numb. I am a bit disappointed with Lucas over the treatment of Keisha Castle Hughes. A lot of hoopla over her appearance of about 5 seconds. I would have hope for some speaking. The main problem with Ep III... it's extremely rushed towards the end. The pace is clearly off. Not something I would have expected from Lucas. Who's attention to detail has irritated some fans (not me) by messing around with eps 4,5, and 6. Why he rushed the hyped parts towards the end... I'll never know. That is, Padme's death, Darth Vader's retrofit, and the exile of Yoda and Obi Wan. The book did a far better job with this. I almost expect some sort of massive redo when it comes to DVD. The rest of the movie did fairly well, although the reliance on cgi fakery shows it's ugly head every time. Including Yoda again. Which would be why 1, 2 and 3 can't match the realism of 4, 5 and 6. I will have to say LOTR did a far better job at subtle CGI than any of the Star Wars. I hope for a good explanation on DVD.In conclusion though, yes see it at the theater. If for some chance someone gets a hold of a copy of the screener, I see no point to watching it. Such big movies like Star Wars show up poorly on the small screen.7/10 Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 8/10 Replayable: 10/10",7,1,1,16 June 2005

Bruce Almighty," Barely tolerable beginning.
","(spoilers?)you know jim carrey.  he's a nut.  so of course it was hard to watch him make an a** of himself at the beginning.  It does get better.  And in some cases you might end up tearing up.  Although clearly The Truman Show is Carrey's best, this isn't too bad.  But the director in charge overshot the movie.  So it's a bit choppy.  Skips around.  Many of these details come out by watching the 30 minutes of deleted scenes.  Some I thought should have been kept in.  But many never should have been shot.  So the director stunk as far as overshooting the movie.  The editor stunk because he took too much out.And the sexual overtones knock this movie way down, because it could have been a decent family movie.  Aniston is probably better here than Along Came Polly, but having dialogues like.  Hey are my boobs bigger?  And guys praying for their schlong to get bigger.  Just too many innuendo to suit me. That is... for a family movie.  I'm surprised this movie wasn't rated R. The amount of language in here is astonishing... for pg -13It sure is a laugh.

X2: X-Men United," Not bad, but no where near as good as the first
","(spoilers??)It's as though they attempted to overplot the movie.  I sometimes complain about poor plots.  This movie is over plotted.  They tried to shove to much story into the 2 hours they had.  In some instances, it created utter confusion.  It certainly wasn't as fun as the first.  The first movie had a comic book feel to it.  The second one is taking itself too seriously.  The score is somehow different and not as inventive.  Some of the special effects really suck, but in other cases it's amazing.Then there's the obvious spoiler.  Throughout the movie they hint at something going on with Jean Grey.  So when you think she's buried under all that ice, was that really what happened.  So I had to ask an x men fan about that.  I guess most of them are laughing at those who think she's dead.  Oh well. ;)Another gripe, the first movie was more open to outsiders.  You know, people who arn't X-Men fans.  X2 as they now call it (which will be really stupid if they call it X3 later....  Vin Diesel's gonna get some nasty one's on that.)  is not open to outsiders.  There's alot of need to know beforehand that you indeed need to know before watching the movie.  Frankly outsiders like myself will get utterly lost. So here's my bit, outsiders, get some education in the land of X-Men. Insiders, have a ball.7/10Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 9/10 Replayable: 10/10",7,0,0,16 May 2003

Even below Order of the Phoenix , which despite umbridge making me cringe (hey she's funny in Rat. ) I liked the teaching behind the scene's. This movie , large sections of the book are either missing or were changed in 7.1 so they can't appear in 7.2. The Elf revolt shoulda have been in here. Kreecher should have been in both. I really have no idea what they were thinking with this movie but it might may a little sense to those who bothered to read the book. And again if you only like action but almost no plot.

I won't even bother watching the theatrical versions.However it looks like Peter was rather good on the third film.  It's also not often that you see 200 minutes of movie one a single side of a dvd.

Hart's War," Interesting, but misguided script.
","It's a funny thing when... immediately following the movie your ready to give this a 9/10, and then reality hits and suddenly you have this silly aftertaste in your mouth.  I came to this silly conclusion and I pondered the movie for the last 7 hours.  The movie is extremely emotionless.I had a hard time trying to figure out who to root for.(spoilers??)1.  Thomas Hart... perhaps the only actor in the movie is without a doubt the only person propelling the plot. 2.  William oh whats his name.  (Bruce Willis)... the way the trailer runs and most of the hype... he's the main character.  But his name's not Hart. 3.  I had 2 characters to root for in this movie.  And they weren't Bruce. There was Thomas Hart and our guy from The Peacemaker.  Nothing like figuring for most of the movie that the Nazi perhaps is a nice guy and William's a total loser.  Which he is except the last minute of the movie.This movie really fails at telling any story except the trial.  So bado's for the script.  But it does have it's high of watching while your enjoying the film.  It is fascinating to watch.  But there is no suspense in this movie.  It may totally bore the sh** out of some people.  So my advice to you is..  Don't watch this movie expecting much if your 1.  a bruce willis fan 2.  A WWII movie fan . and 3 know absolutely nothing about what this story is based off of.  The dvd gives us no historical lesson here.The dvd itself is a marvel of stupidity.  Giving the widescreen a 2 layer event with special features and failing to do it for those who like p/s. Course I like widescreen over p/s (pain & scream) but really...  why tick off those who like p/s?  The only plus of course with MGM's take on p/s is that the p/s side is single layer.

This was hence a war of words more than a show of force, meaning...our hot dog is longer than yours crap that gave the cold war it's name. (just in case.  there might be spoilers and there might not be.)Knowing that bobby & Jack are killed later on in the game, it's rather sobering to see them being acted out.  Knowing that every line these actors are playing are playing people who's emotions won't last the decade.  There is a small bit about the casting of JFK.  Kevin Costner sounds more like JFK than the person playing him.  This is not to say Kevin's er accent is off. (like Robin Hood) Since I never even heard of Kenny, I doubt I can make a judgement call on how bad Kevin's voice is.This movie would be great for a history report.  (bearing in mind that not everything this movie is... is true.)  In the end, I really found myself loving this film.  There's a quality to it that isn't like other films out there.  Perhaps because it's a history piece.Either way, the dvd will blow your mind.  It's got historical footage up the wazzooooooo.... deleted scenes and the works.  Not bad for such a film.

Anyone want a jar full of ears?The music is bizarre.  The storyline is at times very vague.  It's as though the movie was thrown together.  Definately not Martin's best work.  Sure Daniel Day Lewis was great in the movie, but it isn't his best movie either. That still belongs to In The Name of the Father.Leo looks as mad as can be, but I wouldn't call that acting.

The dvd is disappointing.  It's been splayed over 2 dvd's, with next to nothing in special features.
In the end, it's okay, it ain't bad.  But it's nothing special.  In fact after watching the history documentary on disc 2, it's obvious that the big huge mob scene was way too short.

Spectre," Didn't think anything could top Skyfall. This did. It's a normal Bond film.
","Whether you think this is a sequel or a prequel set in modern times thats up to you. Fact remains James Bond invented reboots. And the movies were shot out of order so you can't really say they are prequels or sequels either. With all the Bond's films I've seen (all of them and used to watch them everywhere. Although I'm not a huge fan of the Daniel Craig movies that isn't to say they aren't good movies. Bond was never really meant to win Oscars and Craig's try. Thus removing the fun out of them :( Think License to Kill skipping like a record. Doesn't batter what building they are in, Optics doesn't really matter to me. So MI6 is blown up. Ho hum. Always thought that building was absurd anyway.. Should never show the building it's in. This was unique. Why Judi Dench was in the series at all. Well she wanted her 20 but it confused things a bit. Casino Royale was for sure a prequel as it was the first book. I consider the rest prequels Especially this movie. Smersh was before Spectre. Well no Blofeld is in the picture for the first time. I shall assume Dr No is in the future. Where Bond series goes from there thats up to the future. Is this a review? All I can say is I loved the teaser trailer to Skyfall, but Spectre was way better. It was a normal Bond film. Around Goldeneye or closer. Is any one Bond actor better. Well I like some more than others but they are all equal to me. So basically the 4th movie is connected to the 3 movies before it. It should have ended here. I see nothing wrong with the ending. So what about the Ejector seat. Each Bond is a reboot. And again shot out of order so I can't really say which is a Prequel after Casino Royale or not. Each movie is mainly connected to each other. Craigs are off a bit but not much. Vesper being the main issue. Yeah the movies before Craig were connected in someway but thats Bond. This was just a normal ending.; Whether he was retired or not (oh god how many times has he done that or gotten killed) Just a normal ending and a normal Bond.

Now I haven't read the book so I really don't know it's accuracy... but this was a major setback.Overall, the movie isn't a total loss since it basically picks up the action where the last one left off.

Except where some gangster / Mob jokes came up. I've watched movies like that. I like movies, so obviously the Mob jokes scored. Especially the blowfish :) But aside from that. If your not really a Hip Hop fan, perhaps you ought to stick with Finding Nemo. Which is a much better film overall. Usually Dreamworks is better. I have a feeling Madagascar will be better. But it's just a feeling. Or the Wallace and Gromitt Film. But this one. Like the old Richard Pryor humor.... goes right over my head.6/10Quality: split 4/10 (story) 9/10 (CGI) Entertainment: 5/10 Replayable: 3/10",6,1,4,15 March 2005
Princess Mononoke," One of the best movies I've seen in years.
","Not to mention it's a good family movie. Beware of the violence though.A good compromise movie, nor right nor leftest.  I do however dislike the english dubbed version yet so far.  I've yet to find  Claire Danes as a good voice actor.  Everyone else was okay, though Billy Bob wasn't the best either.  Still better than Danes however.  Go rent this movie.  Too bad though In the upcoming DVD release, there is no japanese language version. :(10/10",10,1,2,7 September 2000
The Simpsons Movie," Disappointing
","Okay I've been out of touch with The Simpsons series for a little while. But I really don't quite understand the hoopla over this movie. It's 87 minutes long!!! About 3 shows worth. And the 3 shows have been funnier than this. Not to say it's not funny, but I wasn't busting a gut over it. All it was was just a rehash of stuff from the series. Boring!! I'm having more fun Watching Shrek The Third than on this movie. I was also disappointed in the DVD. I thought there'd be more too it. The Aqua Teen Hunger Force has more original jokes than this. I just didn't see the point. Other than Maggie's first word, it was just another episode of the Simpsons. 6/10Quality 6/10 Entertainment: 3/10 Replayable: 2/10",6,1,1,20 January 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," George Clooney's best movie
","Loved it.  Absolutly loved it.  Definatly a must watch.  The ending is so hilarious.  You'll be killin yerself laughin. I'm not talking stupid humor, I'm talkin old fashioned funny barbarious fun. Good fun.  Take yer family out fun.  You have to see it first to see fun.I do say you might not understand half of it, and it's Odyssey connection, but might as well watch it you critters.9/10",9,0,0,21 June 2001
