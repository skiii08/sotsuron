Iron Man 3," another hit from Robert,love you IRON MAN
","I loved the movie...great action with a the surprise of little more to iron man's love life.Awesome camera work,great VFX and the iron man's suits are lovely as always.The only thing that pulls u back is that the film is a little different from the comics,but i guess its the need of the time.This movie is not just about iron man and its enemies but its about his personal life too, first time its about Tony Stark.Its a visual treat for machine and mechanics lovers,all those gadgets and gears just make it perfect. A great round of applause to people who design the Armour's,love you guys.So all you folks who haven't seen this movie yet,go watch it because it is definitely going to add some more fun to avengers 2.Heil IRON MAN!",9,2,7,4 May 2013
