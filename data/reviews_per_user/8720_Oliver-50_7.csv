Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Impossible 3
","*SPOILERS AHEAD* I don't understand why the world needs to have Mission Impossible 3. For that matter, I didn't understand why we needed Mission Impossible 2. I suppose that since the finale of the first film ended on a leftover gag from the 60's TV series that they felt it was okay to dish out another sub-par spy thriller. But Mission Impossible 2 was nothing like the first film. John Woo replaced Brian DePalma and instead of an intriguing premise with some sweat-inducing sequences we get a stoic Tom Cruise acting cool and casual and risking everything to save a girl he hardly knows. He jumps off moving bikes, he hangs from mountains, he takes on a dozen bad guys at once (all the while doves fly about for no apparent reason). Ehtan Hunt is super human.So why does Mission Impossible 3 start off with Ethan Hunt battered and bruised struggling and hoping that his wife will not be executed right before his very eyes. Why is he know a married man with a normal life and normal friends. What made him stop doing impossible missions? I suppose it's because he met a woman and fell in love blah blah blah - but what happened to the woman from the first? By this point I'm sure some of you are thinking that I'm digging too deep into this. Hear me out; Ethan Hunt is a caricature - not a character. With each of these films he is somebody different - so why should we care about his new adventure if the character isn't consistent? The premise of the film is that Ethan Hunt has been out of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) for some time and has fallen in love and is settling down. He his called back into duty by his a former teammate (Billy Crudup) to rescue an old protégé of his, Lindsay,(Keri Russell) who has been kidnapped by an very nasty arms dealer (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Lindsay dies immediately after the rescue and Ethan Hunt takes on another mission; to track down the arms dealer and recover a top secret device called 'The Rabbit's Foot' It's futile to make Ethan Hunt a living breathing human being. The movie tries, but we just never get passed that fact that there really is no story or character to care about. It's easy to pull the wool over the audiences eyes and claim that this good guy is now the bad guy or vice versa when we hardly ever see that character. Mission Impossible 3 is a series of plot devices centered around ideas for action sequences.T he film is another attempt to deliver some over-the-top thrills - all of them hopelessly contrived and silly.When Tom Cruise is running after Philip Seymour Hoffman on the bridge he jumps what looks like a 15 foot gap in a bridge (barely makes it) - even though minutes ago he ran around it...When swinging from one building to another Tom Cruise has his teammates distract the guards so he can land and slide down the building whilst he shoots the guards...couldn't't his teammates have snipered these men off? When trying to break into the Vatican, Tom Cruise causes a traffic jam to distract the cameras so he can leap up a wall, climb down the other side and dress in costume to meet up with Ving Rhames - who swam underneath and then blows up a wall and enters the Vatican too.I scoffed at the film every 5 minutes because of the lack of reasoning.As for the Rabbit's Foot; this is what the movie is about. This is the reason Ethan Hunt's life is in danger; this is the reason his wife is kidnapped; this is the reason he has to fly across the world to retrieve it. Yet, it's never explained to us what exactly 'The Rabbit's Foot' is. It is a cheap, gimmick just to keep us on board. At the end of the film just ask yourself one question. Why? Because if you put the pieces together it's a jumbled mess.",3,0,1,9 June 2006
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man 3
","When Spider-Man came out I was pleased to see that Sam Raimi handled the superhero story competently and delivered one of the better superhero films. Then he went above and beyond and gave us Spider-Man 2 which is a good candidate for the best superhero movie ever. The first Spider-Man gave us the line 'with great power, comes great responsibility' which was a good foundation for what the film was about. Spider-Man 2 had some much better and more thought-out themes - what is important in life, ambition, suffering. Sam Raimi had set the bar pretty high for anyone who wished to make a superhero movie. Apparently the bar was too high for even Raimi.Everything that was special about the first two Spider-Man's seems to have been taken for granted in Spider-Man 3. I loved some of the humorous border-line gags that were present; they did a wonderful job of showing Spidey's pain and dedication and they certainly helped relieve some the dramatic tensions. But here, Raimi doesn't even take the characters seriously to begin with. Nearly every scene has some kind of cheap joke or reference that has you scratching your head. When Peter Parkers starts becoming more aggressive from the black goo Raimi never scares us or makes Peter even remotely threatening. Instead, it's a joke. We see Peter strutting down the street, acting cocky with a swagger that looks more pathetic than tempting. I understand that whole 'it's good to be bad' dynamic that Raimi is going for, but have some respect for the audience, geez. I would have been excited to see an angry, menacing Peter Parker for a few minutes and that would have made it all the more dramatic when he bounces back as a good-guy. Instead it leaves you groaning.The script has managed to make every single character as one-note as possible. We've seen all these actors before, and they have had impressive roles, but here they are hollow. Dunst gets to be mopey and whiny, Franco gets to be a grinning doofus, Howard is pretty and nice. Part of that is Raimi's fault for reducing every scene to it's basics. You know you're in trouble when James Cromwell gives a poor performance. Maguire is passable as Spidey, but he too has very little to work with. The theme of revenge is there, but it's never touched upon in a convincing manner and so Maguire manages to pout, and cry and get angry - but never to any effect.And that is what leads me to Spider-Man 3's biggest downfall. The Sandman. Ugh. Nothing against Thomas Haden Church - it's a good performance considering what little he had to work with. But there is nothing to the character. There is so little in fact that story elements from the first film are re-introduced just to give us something more about him. Other than that this guy is robbing banks to get money for his sick daughter...that's it. Considering that Spider-man was up against Harry and Venom, did we really need this extra stuff? The effects are some of the best I have ever seen in, but that doesn't make up for the feeling that this character is just filler.Then we get to the good stuff; Venom. After watching an hour and a half of obnoxious characters and poor writing Raimi delivers a knockout scene in a church where we are introduced to Venom. It's a dark, violent scene and it's what Spider-Man 3 needed. Sadly it only lasts a bit and we're back to the standard damsel in distress/take on the villains finale that is so overblown and hokey - it's painful to watch.Spider-Man 3 makes it very clear that everyone in the world loves Spidey. It is shoved down our throats so much - complete with a Spider-Man parade and a shot of Spider-Man oh-so patriotic in front of the flag - that the contrast would have been very effective. It would have taken some skill (and balls) to pull off a dangerous, evil Spider-Man and make us root for him still. But Raimi is never up to the task and as a result Spider-Man 3 is full of jokes...making it one big mediocre joke.Raimi never has his eye on what matters. He is more interested in noisy/chaotic action scenes and poorly conceived attempts at humor than he is at developing characters and themes. I would have loved to have Sandman eliminated entirely from the film and just have Peter Parker explore his inner demons - and give more screen time to Venom. He manages to under-use every good thing about the Spider-Man 3, and give us way too much of everything that is filler.It would be a shame to end the series on this low-point. Here's to hoping that Raimi acknowledges his mistakes and gives us a better (not bigger) Spider-Man 4.",4,3,6,4 May 2007
Closer," Not close enough
","Vicous, mean-spirited movie about four people falling in and out of lust with each other, cheating on each other, and hurting each other. The characters throw cynical one-liners back and forth at each other throughout, but they never seem as if they're smart enough to speak this way. The only one who rises above this is Clive Owen who is the best thing in the film and steals every scene he's in. Very unlikable, but strangely addicting if only to find out what becomes of these bad people. No real insight, just a dirty, vulgar film that happens to be pretty pleasing to the eye. Sadly, the opening scene is the best scene in the film - and wouldn't you know; it's a nice, sweet scene.**1/2 out of ****",6,0,0,11 January 2005
Garden State," Garden State
","26 year old lithium-taking, depressed actor Braff, who has been detached from his family for years, receives word that his estranged mother has passed. He decides to take a small vacation to go back home to New Jersey and attend the funeral and reconcile with his psychiatrist father. Writer-Director Braff has some great ideas, many of which work but the film makes it's points early on and then repeats them throughout. This makes for a fairly whiny film at times. Also, the camera shots are often very centered which quickly becomes gimmicky and distracts the viewer. Luckily, there are enough good moments for it to overcome most of its faults. Subplot about reconnecting with father Holm never quite gels. Braff is charming in the lead, but Portman steals the show as the quirky compulsive-liar Sam.**1/2 out of ****",5,0,1,30 December 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Brilliant
","Simply amazing film has two eccentrics (Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet) falling head-over-heels in love after a chance meeting on a subway and spending the day together. But after a rough breakup the two decide they want each other 'erased' from their memories. The film follows Joel (Carrey) as he undergoes the process; entering the mind of him as his memories are being erased. This is perfect film-making at work. Charlie Kaufman's screenplays are always brain-teasers/puzzlers and this one is no exception. Right when you think you get it, you figure out you don't and you keep trying to pick it apart. That's only half the fun. Michel Gondry does a fantastic directing job as we pass through Carrey's crumbling mind; he combines eeriness, surrealism, absurdity and makes it all come alive. As for the cast; Carrey and Winslet have never been better. Mark Ruffalo is a standout in support as the man erasing his memory. This one will stick with you for quite some time. Highly recommended.**** out of ****",10,0,1,25 September 2004
Invincible," Invincible
","A sports movie is not a genre, it's a formula. Try to argue that if you want, but how many sports movies have you seen where the hero isn't victorious in some way. The hero has either learned something about himself/found true love or he wins the big game. Simple as that. So with that in mind most sports movies are predictable from the start, but that's why we watch them; to see a good ol' underdog story. So if you're the least bit sentimental, or better yet if you like the sport, you're in a goldmine. If you're a pretentious film snob who is not at all open to a by-the-numbers Hollywood movie; look elsewhere.Invincible is a by-the-numbers Hollywood movie. Snobs: keep scrolling. It's also a Disney movie. Ouch. Two strikes right there. Snobs: you were warned. Does it have a paper-thin script? Yes. Does it have poorly fleshed-out characters? Yes. Does it have about a dozen too many shots of a lone Mark Wahlberg walking the streets at night? God, yes. Was there a moment every two or three minutes that I shook my head at for how poorly it was executed? Yup. Is it chock full of clichÃ©s? Yes. I'll stop asking questions now. But damn did Invincible get me choked up once or twice. Mark Wahlberg is a very likable actor, and while he doesn't have much to work with, he's just as likable as ever and he's good enough to root for. Even if the film does everything as we expect, in this case we want to expect the expected.*** out of ****",6,0,0,9 March 2007
Bruce Almighty," How the mighty has fallen
","Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today. With his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy, and we love him for it. He has the ability to make mediocre comedies (ala Ace Ventura), and turn them into decent comedic outings. Or, in the case of 'Liar Liar', make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around. Carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas. He was excellent in both 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show.' The guy is remarkable.Then comes 'Bruce Almighty,' an ideal vehicle for Carrey, and a premise that should have worked; Carrey, after complaining about God and how his life stinks, is enabled with God's powers. However, the script is pure recycled garbage. Now, no matter how bad a script is, Carrey's improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny. The problem is that there are very few opportunities for Carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects, only some of which are amusing. Carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects. The writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny, because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving Carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless. He seems more like a 5-year yearning for our attention, wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny, when it's really just annoying.I have always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on 'Friends' and she was superb in last year's 'The Good Girl.' She too has a gift for comedy, but with the script as linear as it is, she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend. She comes across as nagging, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars.'Bruce Almighty' should have been a comedy that works. But it doesn't even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it's making fun of; religion. A few minor giggles (his internet is Yehweh), but instead it's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy. Not to mention that it's tone shifts from silly to heavy-handed, and even black comedy at times. The movie fails on nearly every level. That's not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs, but it's close. Any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it's laughs has problems. But hey, if you find pee jokes funny, go for it.",2,4,10,22 November 2003
