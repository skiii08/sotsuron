The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Journey through troubled youth and discovery in Perks of Being A Wallflower
","Perks of Being a Wallflower has been getting rave reviews and lots of buzz since its release. The genre of youth trying to find themselves is tricky as it can be pretty generic, horribly bad or something great, but it depends on a great story and a cast to carry it in the right direction. This film sports a great cast with Logan Lerman of the Percy Jackson films, Ezra Miller of We Need To Talk About Kevin, and Emma Watson from the Harry Potter franchise, but does it live up to the hype? The Perks of Being A Wallflower follows a young man coping with mental illness, first love, and personal tragedy while trying to step out of the shadows to find a group he can belong too. When he is taken under the wing two seniors his life makes a dramatic turn into the real world. Not only does this film live up to the hype it goes above and beyond it. Unlike most coming of age films, this one has depth to it that was really unexpected. This young cast delivers brilliant performances and has great chemistry together creating a memorable and emotionally charged film about real life instead of the normal up beat imaginary world of Hollywood. Watson steps out of the shadows of the Harry Potter films as not only a beautiful woman, but as a great actress that is sure to continue to light the industry on fire. Lerman and Miller take on their characters with the tortured personalities that push them to the forefront of this film giving it that dark yet sometime light tone that it needs. At first this film feels like your average teen drama, but takes some pretty unexpected dark twists and turns through these characters lives that will surely tug at your emotions on every level. In addition to the great story and brilliant performances all around, the visual style of this film adds to the overall ambiance of the characters themselves and the journey they are on.Besides the great leads, this film also sports a great supporting cast including Paul Rudd, Tom Savini, Dylan McDermott, and Kate Walsh. This is one of those films that while it garnered well deserved praise, still didn't get the credit it deserved. This is one that should have gotten a wider release and recognition for everyone involved. If you haven't seen this film you need to check it out as soon as you can. There is something for every person here and a message of growth and struggle that needs to be heard.",10,3,6,13 March 2013
The Expendables 2," Reload, the Expendables are back
","From the moment the experiment in action of The Expendables hit theaters it was heaven. While not everyone had the fun expected it still delivered the one two punch with the action icons fans of the 90's loved. Sadly there were some major ones left out, but has all been taken care with the latest entry into action lore with the Expendables 2. This time around Stallone has stepped out from behind the camera to let Simon West (Con Air) direct this action epic and brought along some of the key players that were missing.Expendables 2 follows the Expendables as they are sent on a seemingly simple mission, but turns into a search for revenge in hostile territory against a heartless adversary and five tons of weapons-grade plutonium. If you enjoyed the first film you will love this one. If you didn't love the first film you will love this one. Like the previous film this is a testosterone filled gun blazing bloodbath filled with action icons of old doing what we love to see them do. The big difference here as this one just seems like a better overall film. The first film, while fun to watch did seem to be missing a real villain, but here the star player is Van Damme's turn as the cocky adversary they are dealing with. He will quickly remind you why we all loved him so much, while delivering a new type of performance like never before. He has truly grown into something more than just a parody of himself that he seemed to be becoming. The rest of the cast do a great job with the stereotypical one-liners and deliver the action like only they can. This time around besides our key players from the first film, Schwarzenegger, Willis, and Norris get to join in on the fun making this seem almost like a dream. Anyone from the 90's has dreamt of seeing these guys together, but once you see it actually happening it will turn you into a kid again. Everyone has their part to play and do it well, but as with any film with a cast this size; there are some that will get lost in the mix. Here most of the guys have ample screen time, except Jet Li who seems to have taken on more of a cameo role, but still given the time to do what he does. The best of all the cameos has to Norris, who really lives up to his online legend, which they play up in the script as well. He only makes a brief appearance in the movie a couple of times, but it is not only memorable, but he seems to kill more people than anyone else in the entire movie, which is no surprise as he is Chuck Norris.This is exactly what it is meant to be a fun action packed homage to action films of the 90's. This series reminds the rest of Hollywood how a true action film is done and doesn't spare the body count in teaching this lesson. There is just enough story here to bring the film together but not enough to get in the way of raising the body count. The only real issue here is some of the CGI blood, but you can let it go and just have a great time while wondering who they will be bringing together for Expendables 3. As if the movies weren't enough, there are also trailer for both Stallone and Schwarzengger's next films attached which should be enough to tied us over for the release of their next film together The Tomb.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",9,6,16,17 August 2012
Skyfall," Daniel Craig is back as Bond in Skyfall
","The James Bond franchise has had some ups and downs but somehow has stayed going strong over the years. When Daniel Craig took over the role of Bond it sent a shockwave through the fans heart as he delivered a harder edged Bond than ever seen before. Casino Royale knocked it out of the park, but while Quantum of Solace was OK it just didn't live up to the quality of Casino Royale. After much struggle to get the latest Craig Bond film Skyfall made it's finally here, but will it return to what made Royale so good or will it be another sequel like Solace?Skyfall follows Bond as his loyalty to M is tested when her past comes back to haunt her. With an attack on MI6 and a threat that is becoming more personal, 007 must come back from the dead to save her and MI6 before all is lost, no matter how personal it gets. This is easily the best Craig Bond film to date and could rank as one of the best of the 007 overall. Here we get a more emotional Bond times, but not in the realm of whiny or preachy like a lot of stories like this go. While there are some major action sequences, they are noticeably toned down for this latest edition to the popular franchise in favor of taking a more personal approach for both Bong and M, who is given a lot more to do here. Craig steps back into the shows of the titular spy better than ever continuing to breathe new life into this old school spy hero. Dame Judi Dench steps up her game even more to take the M character in a whole new direction giving her a chance to showcase even more of her acting brilliance. Of all the great performances none rival that of Javier Bardem who is the perfect villain. He is a bit over the top strange at times which gives him the feel of the classic villains in the earlier Bond films. Do not be surprised if he ends up with another Oscar nod for this character. The action that is in this film delivers on every level really keeping you the edge of your seat and racking up the body count.Skyfall more than makes up for the issues with Quantum of Solace and even improves on what made Casino Royale so great. In addition to the expected current look and feel of the series, this time around they have added some classic elements that will make any hardcore Bond fan smile taking this film into a whole new level. If there were any doubts about his staying power it will easily be dispelled with Skyfall as Daniel Craig is James Bond and cannot wait to see what they have in store next.",10,7,18,8 November 2012
This Is the End," Prepare for the apocalypse like you have never seen it in This is the End
","For years Seth Rogen has been entertaining audiences with his average guy persona, love of weed and unique laugh. It has become a pretty standard assumption that when most of his films come out there is a good chance that some familiar faces are coming along for the ride. As of late he has been veering away from the stoner comedies and establishing himself in some more mainstream roles showcasing more range. Now he is stepping behind the camera as well along with long time writing partner Evan Goldberg for their latest film This Is The End, but will it deliver as good as the trailer promises? This Is The End follows famous friends Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson that are trapped in Franco's house during a party when the coming apocalypse rains down on the world. The story here is pretty simple and one that could have easily crashed and burned quickly, but thanks to the well written script, great chemistry, and overall fun this ended up being one of the funniest comedies to come along in some time. Goldberg and Rogen have taken two difficult concepts and meshed them together to create on those films that is not only a lot of fun, but seems to get even funnier with each viewing. When actors play themselves they tend to want to take the moment to show the world who they really are, but here they amped things up to create over embellished version of themselves and never take themselves seriously with some going so far out of left field of what fans are used to seeing that they steal the show. The real scene stealer comes from Michael Cera who isn't in the film all that long, but is a laugh riot with his out of character performance. Every one of these guys does a great job and has such awesome chemistry that at times you almost forget you are watching a movie that is until the end of the world begins. This is two kinds of films rolled into one brilliant raunchy ride. The first half is just a bunch of celebrities hanging, but with a subtle focus on the friendship between Rogen and Baruchel. This in turn leads to the issues between them and the others in Rogen's life. This aspect of the story continues throughout the film but is made more subtle as the apocalypse begins which in turn cranks the fun up. There are a lot of visual effects here and for a film of this kind you wouldn't expect all that much, but clearly they went all in and created some really cool visuals that just help the movie that much more. Rogen always has great music in his films and this film is no different, but more so as the music is so out of left field at times, but placed so perfectly that it takes it to another level.Rogen and Goldberg have already established themselves as writers in Hollywood, but here they have stepped it up and showed their abilities as directors as well and delivered a piece of comedic genius. The trailers show a lot of cameos, but there are still plenty of surprises that you won't see coming and will leave you wanting more. It's not every day you can say a comedy has to be seen on the big screen, but there are some aspects that scream for it and they deliver. Some of these guys humor is an acquired taste but there is no doubt that this film delivers on every level making it the funniest film of this year and one that is sure to live long past the apocalypse.",8,3,18,12 June 2013
The Impossible," The Impossible takes you inside the tsunami of 2004
","While you hear about major event son the news all the time, seeing them come to life on the big screen brings them more to life giving viewers a bit of a closer idea of what those involved went through. One of the most shocking natural disasters took place in 2004 when a tsunami hit across Indonesia taking the lives over 200,000 people. This tragic event has now been brought to life in the film The Impossible based on one family experiences during this event, but is it able to convey the terror and desperation these people lived through? The Impossible follows a family on Christmas vacation in Thailand. While hanging out by the pool enjoying the sun and fun, there comes a roar in the distance that will change their lives forever. This is an intense and powerful film that delivers way more than you may have thought from the initial trailers. The cast all do a great job with each of them having to convey a variety of emotions. The story is so insanely unbelievable you have to see it to believe it. Seeing what these people had to endure to survive not only keeps you on edge, but also gets you thinking about what other people had to endure that was easily much worse. The story structure really makes this film even more powerful than it may have been if delivered straight forward. It starts a bit slow while setting things up and makes you almost forget what is coming, only to suddenly slap you in the face when it hits the fan and never truly let's up. Sure there isn't much action beyond the initial destructive force, but the sheer drama and torment these people deal with in the aftermath will keep you stressed and on the edge of your seat. In addition it bounces back and forth between the various characters telling their stories, but still keeping the primary focus on the initial leads. High praise for both the actors and filmmakers for the choice to use and endure actual water on set for the scenes as opposed to all CGI. There is some CGI of course, but the scenes that are the most effective are those watching them really deal with the danger of the water. This keeps you invested in the film and the believability constant.While this movie looked good from the trailers it delivers a lot more than you would expect. The performances are great; the visuals are beautiful and terrifying and it respectfully tackles a tragic event with intensity and passion to let you understand a small bit of what these people really dealt with. There are two sequences that to describe may not sound all that bad, but visually are brutal to watch and will no doubt effect you on some level which is what a great film is supposed to do.",8,1,3,30 April 2013
Argo," Affleck delivers another amazing film
","After years of being one of those actors that was hit and miss with people, who would have thought he would become one of the most sought after great directors in the industry. After his last film The Town received so much acclaim and award nominations everyone was wondering if it was just a fluke. His latest film Argo takes on the actual events during the Iran Hostage Crisis finds him once again taking on double duties with directing and starring, but can he bring these events to life and create another great film along with it? Argo follows the unbelievable true story of six Americans that have found shelter with the Canadian ambassador in Iran when the revolution reaches a boiling point. The CIA works alongside some heavy hitters in Hollywood to create a fake film production to concoct a risky plan to try and get them out of the country. For a movie that focuses on a situation that was so dire and heavy, this film comes off a bit lighter than expected. Ben Affleck has crafted a brilliantly entertaining film on numerous levels. The story alone is intriguing watching their unbelievable plan come to life. During this time of the film it delivers some really funny moments, without falling to far off track and confusing the kind of film this is. The acting here is top notch with everyone involved, including Affleck himself delivering some awesome performances. The dynamic between Affleck and Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston is perfect creating a duo that both entertain as well as keep this story on track. The biggest treat in this film are brilliant and a lot of time funny performances from John Goodman and Alan Arkin. These guys really bring all the Hollywood aspect to the film to life while delivering Oscar worthy performances that will hopefully be recognized. The gritty look to this film really helps to capture the vibe and tone of the film while combined with the attention to detail, helps take you into the time period it takes place.Brilliant directing, acting, story and some fun sci-fi references throughout takes Argo into the realm of one of the best films to come along in some time. Affleck proves once again of his talent as a director and that The Town was no fluke. This is a must see film that will no doubt be all-the buzz when award season comes around and deserves every bit of it.",10,253,485,12 October 2012
The Flowers of War," Christian Bale takes on the Flowers of War
","Asian film market is known for their epic films, but not with A-list American stars attached. In The Flowers of War, Christian Bale jumps into the starring role of a film that is anything but American. Filled with various languages including English, Chinese, and Japanese this film attempts to do something very rare and bring these two cultures of filmmaking together in hopes to create something truly special, through a painful time in history.The Flowers of War follows a mortician who arrives at a Catholic church to prepare the priest for burial, but is thrust into the middle of the Sino-Japanese war, among the convent girl students and prostitutes of a nearby brothel. Now as the unplanned protector of them all, must find a way to help them survive the horrors of the Japanese army. This seemed like it was going to be one of those movies that were more interesting in idea instead of actual execution, but it ended up delivering so much more than you would think. This film takes on some sensitive subject matter and doesn't hold too many punches delivering. Bale gives a great performance, once again thrusting him into something you wouldn't expect. You would never think that an actor with the wide variety of parts he has played with such dedication is the same guy who just finished playing Batman. Here he is forced to carry most of the film as the virtually the only American here in a sea of Asian performers. The rest of the cast delivers some great and powerful performances that are both touching at times and painful. This is one of those stories that doesn't sugar coat the horror of war and delivers some sequences that are a bit hard to take in. While most of the film is more of a drama, there are plenty of action war sequences that are not only important to the story, but also help to break up the slow pace of this heavy story.This is a film that is not only a success in a unique culture mash-up in film, but also one that will pull out an emotional response of some kind. This emotionally charged dark film is way heavier than you may think going in, but is one that deserves to be seen. If you're not a big fan of the foreign film world, this is a perfect film to give a try and discover not only a great film, but the greatness of Asian cinema.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",9,1,1,7 August 2012
We're the Millers," It's just your average drug smuggling road trip in We're The Millers
","The rated R comedy is one that either really pushes the limits and succeeds or just falls apart. The latest brings Horrible Bosses stars Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston back together once again letting Aniston unleash her inner sex symbol, but does deliver more than that and go above and beyond or is all the funny in the trailer? We're the Millers follows a pot dealer who is forced to move a huge shipment of weed from Mexico to the U.S. In order to divert attention of the law he takes up with a stripper, a homeless girl, and a geeky kid that lives next door to create a fake family on vacation. The trailer was funny, but this movie is even funnier that it lets on. The beginning of the film struggles a bit and looked as though it was going to be a dud, but once they hit the road things pick up and finds its stride. This cast has some great chemistry as both friends and enemies as things progress. The film is somewhat of reminiscent of National Lampoon's Vacation, with Sudeikis delivering a similar deadpan character that works really well, especially when he begins to lose it. Aniston showcases her comedy chops and really let's lose as well as delivering one of her sexiest characters to date. Emma Roberts and Will Poulter are great as the 'kids' but it's Poulter he really steals most of the scenes. His character is so innocent and confused that he is a laugh riot. The real treat of the whole film is the inclusion of the always great Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn whose uptight strange family creates a camping experience for them all that steals the film. Ed Helms, who is usually great, isn't given all that much to do and feels a bit miscast at times, but still manages to entertain.With any film like this there is some heart to the story that does keep it from ever going as far as it could have, but it still manages to create one of the funniest R rated comedies to come along in a while. There are numerous moments that are over the top and unbelievable on some level, but they all fit the formula to make a film like this work. Stick through the credits for some fun bloopers and a great practical joke moment played on one of the cast.",7,1,5,7 August 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Step out of the fairy tale with Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters
","Every year there seems to be a theme in theaters where there are a couple of subjects with numerous filmmakers delivering varying films on the same idea. This year one of those themes seems to be re-imagining of fairy tales. The first one to hit the big screen is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. The trailers looked a bit cheesy, but at the same time looked as though they may have some fun to deliver. With Hawkeye himself Jeremy Renner at the helm alongside Bond girl Gemma Arterton, X-Men alum Famke Janssen and the director of the awesome zombie film Dead Snow Tommy Wirkola could they deliver something that actually works or will it close the book on this story before it ever gets started? Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters follows the now grown Hansel and Gretel who spend their lives as bounty hunters, tracking and killing witches around the world. While their latest job seems like just another hunt, soon turns out to be much more with the Blood Moon approaching, they soon realize they are up against something more powerful than just your average witch. Let's be clear, this movie is way better than it has any right to be. The premise is a bit silly and could have easily fallen in line with a SyFy Channel movie, which did their own version as well. Thanks to the increased star power of Renner, the high quality fun action and director Tommy Wirkola this film turned out to be surprisingly fun. The first half has its fun moments, but limps along a bit before it really finds its footing, but once it does it is a pretty fun ride. The acting is average at best, with Renner being the most entertaining and Janssen eats up the screen playing a great creepy witch. The biggest issue comes with Arterton who handles the action well, but just plays the character way to stiff. What makes this film really work is the execution of the action sequences. They are pretty out there at times, but are shot and executed really well to deliver the fun you would expect. In addition director Wirkola made sure to bring the gore along with him which took the film away from the silly direction it could have gone and into the R rated territory.Believe it or not this film works really well to deliver an R rated fantasy adventure the works. Filled with humor, action, creepy witches, great effects, gore, and Derek Mears as the scene stealing troll Edward this is one of those popcorn films that you are sure to enjoy if you just get in on the joke of it all. It seems to have done well enough and sets itself up nicely to a possible franchise and if they can keep the formula intact is one that is welcomed.",6,1,3,3 February 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spider-Man swings back into action
","After years of struggling to get a Spider-Man movie made, Sam Raimi not only stepped up to the plate, he knocked the series out of the park. There were issues with all of his movies on some level, especially with his third outing, but nonetheless they worked. Usually the re-boots or remakes take quite some time to happen, but this time around it took less than ten years to make it happen. With Amazing Spider-Man, they forget the previous films happened and start from scratch. Fans were up in arms trying to figure out why this was happening all over again, but the trailers look to have stepped it up. Will this new incarnation be something more or just a failed attempt at cashing in and continue the demise of the once promising franchise that started with part 3? The Amazing Spider-Man follows Peter Parker, as he finds a clue that might help him understand why his parents disappeared when he was young and this path puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner. All while trying to come to terms with his new found powers and emotional struggle with his feelings for Gwen Stacy. Not only doe Amazing Spider-Man work, it ended up being the best of the Spider-Man films so far. Was it necessary to go back to the beginning and tell this story again? No, but manages to make it work with so much more depth than the previous film. This film manages to bring the character story front and center as it should be instead of just about Spider-Man swinging around and fighting. The relationship here between Garfield and Stone comes off way more believable than anything in the previous films. Garfield is the perfect Spider-Man jumping right off the page of the comic and bringing both Spider-Man and more importantly Peter Parker to life. Rhys Ifans doctor Connors works well enough, but isn't given a whole lot to do until the second half of the film and most of that is as the Lizard. The rest of the cast do a great job bringing everything together. The story really steps it up here bringing all the emotion needed to make it work. It takes its time to build up to every moment rather than just rushing to get to the action. Anyone that has ever read the comic knows that it was always about the character arcs more than the action and here they nail it. Have no fear; there is plenty of action that is some of the best of a Spider-Man film so far. The decision to use less CG really changes the dynamic of this film and makes it seem more realistic. The lizard comes off really well and is a great villain, but comes off a bit one dimensional and underdeveloped, but still manages to work. If there is any complaint about this character it's his mouth when he's talking, it comes off a bit awkward that seems due to the CG. The 3D works OK, but really only adds depth to the film and a few moments here and there, but overall is really not necessary.While the original Spider-Man still holds up in comparison to this new film, it comes off a bit campy. In comparison this is Nolan's Batman Begins compared to Burton's Batman; both are good, but just not in the same league. Like it or not Spider-Man has been re-booted, but it works great and creates a whole new world to build on. This Spider-Man really lives up to its name as amazing.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",8,1,4,12 July 2012
Now You See Me," Things are not as they seem in Now You See Me
","One genre that can really entertain when done right is the heist flick. For them to work one of the most important things is to have a creative approach to the heist or the heist itself. Lately there have been very few adding anything new to the genre, but with Now You See Me they look to have tried to add a bit of magic to the struggling genre literally. With a great cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine does it create the spectacle it promises or are the trailers all an illusion? Now You See Me follows an FBI agent and an Interpol detective track a team of illusionists who pull off bank heists during their performances and reward their audiences with the money. For once a film got the heist element right and delivered a clever and engaging story to go along with it. This isn't a perfect film by any means, but thanks to the magic element, which is usually a film killer, it takes it to a level that keeps things moving in an interesting direction. While the trailers showcase the magicians as the leads, this isn't quite the case. Make no mistake they are in the majority of the film and deliver the best parts of the film, but this movie follows more of Mark Ruffalo's detective as he is obsessively trying to solve this case. Typically Ruffalo is great and he is decent here, but just not up to par of his normal performances. Most of this is due to the character not being all that interesting and the attempt to thrust more depth into it that was really not necessary. The rest of the cast have great chemistry and chew up the scenery around them with Michael Caine really the only one with very little to do. The heists are fun to watch and ponder how they pulled it off even though some of them are predictable, but for the most part create a great presence on screen. While not a lot there are some great action moments here and there that were pretty surprising featuring Dave Franco that probably were not all him, but still fun to watch none the less.With the exception of some of the useless character elements to the Ruffalo character the rest of this movie is pretty entertaining adding a unique twist to the heist genre that has been missing. It probably would have been even better if the main focus had been on the magicians also known as the Four Horseman, but who knows maybe the less is more approach is why it worked so well.",Null,3,5,2 June 2013
Django Unchained," Tarantino takes on the western in Django Unchained
","Over the years Quentin Tarantino has delivered some great films each getting better than before, but always stepping into new and different territories. After the smash success of his period film Inglourious Basterds, he once again travels back in time to tackle a period piece with Django Unchained. While there are some moments that pay homage to the original Django film starring Frank Nero, this is in fact an original film by Tarantino, but with its dark subject matter will it be too much for even Tarantino? Django Unchained follows a former dentist turned bounty hunter and a slave that he trains to become his partner to earn his freedom to help get a hefty bounty, but leads them into a face off against a ruthless plantation owner in hopes to free his slave wife. This is easily Tarantino's best film to date. He has taken a subject that is so dark and depressing and somehow managed to deliver something funny, violent, and intense like only he can. Jamie Foxx steps into this role and gives his all delivering a great performance. At one time it was talked that Will Smith was up for this role, but thankfully Foxx took it on because he has done something special here. Christoph Waltz is as good as always delivering a unique charm and charisma to his performance that really sucks you in. DiCaprio is not only as brilliant as ever, but throws everything he can into a role that is like nothing he has delivered before. The rest of the cast including some surprises all do a great job to bring this wonderful dark west to life. It's amazing how many really funny moments are in this film based on the subject matter. Most of these funny moments are not always intentional comedy, but just the ridiculous nature of how things were during that time. In addition the funny and dark moments, there is some vintage Tarantino with easily one of the most violently bloody western shoot outs to be seen in some time.While everyone has their Tarantino favorites, it will not be a surprise if this one tops them all as the most ambitiously brilliant piece of cinema. Tarantino wanted to make his own spaghetti western and has done that and so much more. This once again proves the brilliance of Tarantino and sets the bar high for whatever he decides to do next, much like Inglourious Basterds did before it. If you like westerns, blood, Tarantino, or anyone involved in this film you need to get out and check it out. It has a run time of about 2 hours and 45 minutes but moves along and entertains so much you will never notice.",10,5,20,24 December 2012
The Bourne Legacy," There was never just one in the Bourne Legacy
","When word got out that Matt Damon was no longer apart of the Bourne franchise it was a bit of a letdown as they delivered some surprisingly great action films. With the addition of Renner and taking a new direction to the series added some interesting promise of what could be done, but will it work and keep the franchise alive or just be a nail in the coffin to end the franchise? The Bourne Legacy follows an operative from the same program that gave birth to Jason Bourne who is forced to go on the run. For the most part this is a pretty good addition to the series, but defiantly has some struggling moments. The first half of the film works to set up the whole new series of events and characters, but moves at a snail's pace. They were smart to use both old and new characters for this addition, but the slow build you have to endure could easily push people away from getting to the fun interesting action part of the film. Once things finally start moving it picks up a bit with some great action and interesting development, but still never really delivers the one two punch that the previous entries managed to push out. Renner does a great job with the character, but his loses something without having some mystery to solve. He has his memory and knows what he is doing and it really takes some of what makes the Bourne series so fun away. While there isn't a lot of action, what we do get is pretty intense and well done.The biggest issue besides the pacing to this film is the seemingly abrupt ending. You spend almost two and half hours with these characters and then it just seems to suddenly end without any big send off. Yeah there is a big action sequence, but nothing that felt like the ending. As the final scene plays you are left there with a sense of 'that's it?' While there are some major issues, this does have the chance to set up a new direction to the series and does have redeeming qualities, just doesn't deliver as much as it could have.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",5,4,9,19 August 2012
Here Comes the Boom," Kevin James brings the Boom
","Whether you find him funny or not, Kevin James has been racking up the hits since focusing on movies. While not all were hit with the critics, he has managed to garner a following. The trailer for his latest Here Comes The Boom looked like a mix of the same old fair that he normally delivers, but does it have any chance of working to deliver a funny comedy or will it end up being just another forced goofy addition to his resume.Here Comes The Boom follows a biology teacher who is determine to save the music program from being cut in their school by becoming a mixed-martial arts fighter. While the premise is a bit out there and some of the scenarios are a bit far-fetched this movie works surprisingly well. There are plenty of laughs here that work on numerous levels, but depending on how big a fan of James you are will determine how funny they are. The real surprise here was the fact that there was so much more here than just a stupid comedy. The story is a typical underdog tale with comedy, but enough heart to keep you rooting for James throughout the whole film. Gone is the usual over the top bumbling funny fat guy, in its place was a cooler everyman that works perfectly for this story. James steps up to really deliver more than he has to date. He shows not only a good range with some different emotions, but is pretty impressive with his ability to carry the fight scenes. It was nice to see that while this was a comedy, they still took the fighting side of it seriously to deliver something not only believable but entertaining and will suck you right into the action. The rest of the cast do a great job of bringing everything together, with the real highlights being Henry Winkler who is a spitting image of the band teacher in the Simpsons and former MMA legend Bas Rutten. Both of these guys never take themselves seriously and deliver some funny memorable and likable characters.This movie was a real surprise on almost every level. It delivers an almost Rocky like underdog tale with some over the top funny moments to create something completely unexpected. Kevin James really knocked it out of the park here and hope he sticks to these kinds of roles and continues to stretch his acting range.",7,96,114,12 October 2012
Elysium," Matt Damon will do whatever it takes to get to Elysium
","Of all the genre's out there, science fiction seems to be the one rarely getting it right these days. When Neill Blomkamp burst onto the screen with his gritty racial commentary film District 9 it changed the genre for the better. Now he is back with his latest look at the future with Elysium and is bringing Matt Damon along for the ride. The trailers looked to deliver a similar vision of his previous film, but does it pack the same punch both in the story as well as visually?Elysium follows a man desperate to get to Elysium, a space station where the very wealthy live in a pristine world, while the rest of the human race remain on an overpopulated ruined Earth. With nothing left to lose, he takes on a mission against Elysium's secretary Delacourt and the entire system to save himself as well as the millions of others on Earth. Once again Blomkamp has created a film that not only entertains but has numerous levels of social commentary without ever getting overly preachy. This time out there seems to be the health care system, over population, and pollution that all make up this world these characters inhabit. Matt Damon continues to deliver with him really stepping it up even more than usual here. What is great about his character is that he feels more like a normal guy with flaws and a reluctant hero forced into this situation as opposed to wanting to be there. You feel his desperation and in turn can imagine the rest of the planet and what they are going through. District 9 star Sharlto Copley plays a completely different type of character and is a complete badass. He steals every scene he is in and is near unrecognizable in this role. Every time he steps on screen you know something great is going to happen. The always great William Fichtner has a brief but not surprisingly good presence here. Jodi Foster is the only that just doesn't seem to work all that well. Her performance felt forced at times and she seemed to float in and out of the strange accent she is trying to use. The visuals are gritty, dirty, and beautiful all at once and are the main catalyst to make this film come to life. There is plenty of action here and at first seems to be playing it a bit safe, but quickly proves otherwise as the film moves forward.This is one of the best science fiction films to come along in some time and has everything you could possibly want. Most will just watch this movie and see the action spectacle and cool visuals, but this film is so much more. Pay attention to the story and what it is trying to tell you and this film will have a greater effect on you. Some of the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more, but overall still gets the message across all while delivering a bad ass action science fiction film that should not be missed.",7,17,27,8 August 2013
Mama," Beware mothers fury in Mama
","The ghost haunting genre has been done to death at this point. More often than not they just don't offer anything new to the genre or even as films. They latest to tackle the subject comes in the form of Mama, produced by Guillermo del Toro and features Jessica Chastain, but is that enough to deliver something new or will it be just be another film that needs to be exorcised? Mama follows a man along with his girlfriend forced to raise his young nieces after the death of his brother that left them alone in the forest for 5 years. Taking on the difficult task becomes more challenging when it becomes clear that they may not have come out of the forest alone. Surprisingly this film delivers pretty well overall despite its standard PG-13 rating. Chastain does a fine job as usual, but the overall vibe of her character almost doesn't really seem to have a point, but at the same time doesn't affect the finished product. For this film to really work falls in the hands of the young girls who have to be likable and creepy all at once and they succeed. This aspect of the story is what helps to step it out of the shadows of every other film in this genre to deliver something a bit more fresh. For the majority of the film it works really well, giving some great build up and development, but loses a bit of steam in the finale. It doesn't ruin the movie or anything it just gets predictable and shows too much of Mama. Throughout the buildup you see here numerous times, but they keep it in the shadows and quick glances and it works perfectly to create a truly creepy character, but once she is fully revealed is a bit silly looking. With that being said, it still works and some of the direction they do go with the finale was a bit unexpected which makes up a bit for the disappointing reveal.This film is one of the better of the genre to come along in some time. While the trailers attempted to lead you to believe it might be scary, this film sports more of a creepy nature than anything scary, but still works fine. The little girls make this film especially the younger of the two who is just disturbing on numerous levels throughout the film. If you enjoy this genre, then Mama is defiantly one you will want to give a try.",6,0,1,3 February 2013
Sinister," Sinister warns of watching films you find in the attic
","Over the years horror films have gotten to be a dime a dozen. More often than not they just fail to deliver. With the found footage craze, it added a new depth, but sadly ran its course almost as fast as it became popular. The latest to try it's hand in delivering something new to the genre is Sinister, that while it's not a found footage film, does use some of the technique to tell what looks to be a somewhat unique tale.Sinister follows a crime novelist and his family as they move into a new home for him to work on his latest true-crime novel. The closer he comes to the truth, the more he realizes he might have put his family in the path of pure evil. This film definitely delivers on not only the story it wants to tell, but in the creepy nature it sets out to achieve. The use of the old school films to tell the story adds a new dimension that really stepped this film up. Ethan Hawke did an awesome job with his character and delivering the obsessive nature needed to bring this part to life. The film takes its time to build up the strange disturbed story that is needed, but is also where the film has a minor issue. There are some aspects to the story that are just not needed and really seep in from time to time and end up slowing things down causing it to lose some of the momentum its building. Thankfully that is the only issue with this movie. It really delivers a unique addition to the horror genre with a new creature/character that could easily be brought back from time to time if done correctly. There isn't a lot of blood here, but there is a lot of moments that showcase the fills to come, while really sticking images in your brain that affect you without ever seeing them.This is a great addition to the genre, but one that will no doubt be met with mixed feelings due to its sometime slow nature. Despite the sometimes slow pace this is a cleverly creepy horror film that is sure to be a refreshing taste for those fans of the genre.",6,4,8,12 October 2012
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Ice Age: Continental Drift splits the continents for an all-new adventure
","It's hard to believe that the Ice Age series began 10 years ago and is still going this strong. While there have been some weak moments in the series, each installment has been entertaining on some level and clearly done well enough to spawn a fourth addition to the series with Ice Age: Continental Drift. All the original cast of Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Lequizamo are back as well as every new member that has joined up along the way and some new additions in this installment. Has this series finally dried up or could they possibly create yet another fun adventure for these characters? Ice Age: Continental Drift follows everyone's favorite prehistoric characters as they are forced on an all new adventure when the continent is split and set adrift at sea. Along the way they encounter new and interesting characters including a band of pirates sailing and iceberg ship exploring the new world. Not only is this another fun addition to the series, it may easily be the best yet. The story is pretty simple and fun keeping the same format that has been working, but returning to an adventure that focuses more on the original three than all the others, yet still giving them their time to play. The villainous pirates led by Gutt and voiced brilliantly by Peter Dinklage was the most entertaining character that has been introduced to this series so far. They even managed to keep the long running Scrat story fun where it should have run its course by now. All the voice actors maintain the good work they have done from the start keeping these characters from wavering their personalities. The animation this time around seemed to come off as some the best of all the films looking as though it had been cleaned up a bit more. The 3D worked well enough but never was just in your face and annoying.Anyone that has had fun with this series at all should check this one out as you are sure to have a great time. If it makes the money again there is no doubt that they will churn out another one, but this one is a good way to just let the series end on a high note. It kind of comes full circle finally giving everyone some sort of relationship of their own in a happily ever after way without being too mushy about it.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",9,0,2,12 July 2012
The Conjuring," There is something evil in this house in The Conjuring
","When director James Wan burst onto the scene with SAW he clearly had a unique vision for horror, but who would have thought he would be the one to step out of the torture porn genre to some truly effective haunting films with Insidious. Now he is taking on the subject again with his latest The Conjuring featuring a great cast including Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor, and Ron Livingston, but can he hit the mark again or will it be a haunting in itself? The Conjuring follows paranormal investigators in the 1970s who work to help a family that's terrorized by an evil presence in their home. What starts out as a simple investigation turns into the most terrifying case of their lives. This is not only Wan's best horror film to date, but one of the better of the haunting genre to come along in years. The story is crafted perfectly with a slow build but is well-paced delivering an excellent horror film. The look and vibe screams the 70s and there is something about these stories taking place during this time that just enhances the overall experience. The performances are all great with Lili Taylor stealing the show later in the movie delivering some creepy memorable moments. The directions they take showing the escalation of the haunting are a true pay off as they escalate brilliantly. There are some moments here that have been seen in other films of it's kind, but Wan handles them some perfectly they almost feel like new territory giving this film the perfect classic nostalgic tone while also giving fans something that feels fresh.This is one of those horror films that may not terrify the hardcore horror fan, but is sure to entertain anyone that understands and respects the genre. The average movie goer is sure to leave the theater creeped out at the least and is sure to carry some aspect of this film with them to haunt their dreams. There is already talk of a sequel and these characters are perfect for a franchise as long as they continue to pay close attention to the details and format used here to create a perfect horror film that is sure to become a classic.",10,2,5,18 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Prepare for the Dark Knight to rise
","The Dark Knight rises is easily the most anticipated film of the year and has a lot to live up to with the previous two entries just seeming to get better and better. With the same creative team intact, can Nolan and Bale pull off the ultimate finale to their trilogy and deliver the film we've all been waiting for or will it fall to the dreaded bad third film syndrome that seems to plague most series? The Dark Knight Rises continues the journey of Batman eight years after he took the fall for the death and crimes of Harvey Dent. Forced back into action to take on the terrorist Bane, the Dark Knight returns to protect the city that looks at him as an enemy. The Dark Knight was a brilliant film on numerous levels so going in this film already had a big hurdle to overcome. While it may not have completely overshadowed the previous entry, it easily finds its place on equal ground. This final entry to the Nolan series continues to bring these three films together becoming essentially one long film. Rises brings new realm of personal journey to numerous characters old and new. Christian Bale steps back into the role like he never left bringing a new pain that seems to elevate both Wayne and Batman to another level. Most fans will be happy to know that while the growl like voice is still here, it is toned down a bit so not to be quite as off putting. Michael Caine is given a bit more to do taking the character study between Alfred and Wayne that has been building and he delivers more of his motivational and emotional speeches like only he can. Gary Oldman gets a bit more to do as well getting to channel the Gordon we have been waiting for since the beginning. Tom Hardy steps into the role of Bane, a character that is met with mixed emotions. Known in the comics as the villain that broke the bat, has had many incarnations, most of them not all that good and not widely known to those that aren't comic fans. Believe it or not, Nolan has taken a fairly single dimension character and brought to life a destructive force that smashes through this film with no remorse. The big surprise was Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle aka Catwoman. She seemed to be channeling some of the previous versions, most notably that of the 60's series minus the camp. She really makes this character work bringing the sexiness as well as a more empowered woman aspect to the character. She is easily the best incarnation of this character so far.The story is well crafted bringing all the characters together along with the story to create an epic piece of filmmaking. There are numerous levels to the story that worked well for every character giving each of them their own small story without ever making the film feel overcrowded or forced. It takes a bit to get going, but not in a bad way. There are some pretty heavy moments that push this film along, but will keep you away from the action for longer than you may want. Much like the source material this trilogy is a character study of the inner struggles of a man and not so much about the action. Make no mistake there are plenty of action sequences, each bigger than the next. Nolan has slowed the action down a bit, namely during the fight scenes letting the viewer finally get a better glimpse of the Dark Knight in action. Kudos to Nolan as gone are most of the fancy well-choreographed fights and in their place is a brutality that is needed to make the Bane story work.This is not only a great film, but a brilliant cap to an already brilliant series. It's a truly amazing experience to see this film come to life and wrap up a series that has continued to get better and better. There are plenty of moments that will make both comic and non-comic fans alike smile and cheer. Nolan has stamped his mark on the Batman universe and has done something almost never thought possible. He has delivered a brilliant Batman trilogy and managed to keep the entire brilliant cast in tact all the way down to members of the Wayne Corp board members. This is a film that will make you cheer and sad that it is coming to an end. As this series comes to an end and the credits role you will find yourself sighing in relief and happiness knowing Nolan pulled it off and wondering what's next for the Batman.",10,45,92,17 July 2012
Pitch Perfect," The misfits get in tune for Pitch Perfect
","With the popularity of Glee, it was only a matter of time before a movie of some kind was made to try and capitalize on the subject. With Pitch Perfect, they take on this same idea but attempt to do something a bit new. With a cast including Brittany Snow, Elizabeth Banks, Twilight's Anna Kendrick, and the always funny Rebel Wilson could they have delivered something special or will it just be another forgettable musical? Pitch Perfect follows an all-girl a capella group who thrive on their good looks and pop sings, but after a disastrous performance during the previous year's finals, they are forced to regroup and take on a new unlikely group. As far as story goes there is nothing new here. It's pretty much just the normal underdog story bringing together the misfits to deliver something special, but thanks to some fun cast members and outrageous moments delivers something a bit more. Rebel Wilson really steals this movie every time she steps onto screen. There will be some people that are annoyed with her, but she delivers on every level. She clearly isn't afraid to make fun of herself and it takes her performance to another level. The rest of the cast do a fun job of bringing this film together including some musical numbers that weren't just over the top annoying. The music choice worked better than most of these types of stories. Where Glee uses a theme to tell their story and sometimes works, here it was used to tell the story as well as establish the characters personalities. There are even moments where they seem to be mocking some of the characters and works really well. If there is a complaint, there is the expected evolution in the underdog group, but their final performance really never delivers that satisfying punch it needed.Pitch Perfect was an unexpectedly fun film that works whether you are a fan of musicals or not. This young cast works well together and performs their songs effectively to take an otherwise average film and make it something that stands out a bit. There is talk of a sequel, which is no surprise, and if Rebel Wilson is back then it might work given the right story, but either way give Pitch Perfect a try, it's a pretty fun time.",7,2,4,24 December 2012
Cloud Atlas," Cloud Atlas is cinematic journey of epic proportions
","Every so often a movie comes along that is so ambitious that it pushes the boundaries on almost every level to bring it to life. No stranger to tackle this sort of task the Wachowski's most notably for their Matrix films alongside Tom Tykwer director of Run Lola Run clearly set out to do just that with Cloud Atlas. The trailers sport what appears to be a complex interesting story and an awesome cast featuring Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant, Keith David, and Xun Zhou. Could this ambitious film work as well as it seems or will it end up being to convoluted and confusing? Cloud Atlas follows six intertwining stories featuring stories of an ocean voyage across the Pacific; letters from a composer to his friend; a thriller about a power plant murder; a nursing home escape; futuristic Korea; and the tale of a tribe living in post-apocalyptic Hawaii. To say this movie is ambitious is an understatement. It has so many layers to the story, yet somehow works perfectly. This film plays like six separate films merged together with various common elements. The performances are all brilliant across the board, with Tom Hanks and Hugo Weaving really standing out. Hanks was the most unexpected, but not his acting as he has proved himself as an actor, but more the various roles he took on. Most of these are not ones you ever imagine Hanks to play and he killed every one of them better than the next. Weaving on the other hand is known for playing some out there characters and delivers like never before with every one of his characters he brings to life. Jim Broadbent delivers the most humorous of all the performances as well as the most memorable. The rest of the cast delivered so much to the overall execution of this film especially with the unexpected characters they portray. At times there are some of the actors that you will not even realize they were in the scene or the character you are watching. This movie is amazing to watch and is way more of an experience than just a film. Rarely does a film deliver almost every genre into one piece without becoming so full of itself and confusing, but here it brilliantly tells these stories effectively keeping everything needed in tact to deliver the message it is trying to convey.There are few movies that come along that truly feel epic, but Cloud Atlas is defiantly one of them. There are some moments where the make-up effects don't work near as well, mostly just coming off a bit strange, but if you let it go and buy into the film as a whole it will not deter you from the glorious nature of it all. This is an experience the few films are able to deliver on such a grand scale. It will be interesting to see what everyone takes away from the story itself and its' message as it seems to be touching on everything from love, oppression, reincarnation and more. Everyone should open their mind and let the experience of this film flow into your brain, you will not be disappointed.",10,13,25,25 October 2012
Warm Bodies," Warm Bodies delivers an undead love story
","It's no secret the zombie craze is in full force thanks to some great films and TV shows on the subject. At this point there are so many zombie themed films hitting the market, there is very few that have anything unique to add to stand out. The latest Warm Bodies attempts to step out of the shadows of the others by creating a love story of sorts, mixed with some humor but is it effective or dead before it comes to life? Warm Bodies follows introspective zombie who, much like the rest of the population is cursed to walk as the undead feeding on human survivors. During a routine feeding, he meets a beautiful woman that he suddenly feels compelled to protect. As their relationship begins to grow so does the temperature in his body as he slowly begins to regain his humanity. Soon this effect starts to spread through the other zombies shining a beam of hope on humanity, but first they must contend with not only the trigger happy humans, but also the ferocious Bonie zombies who threaten everyone. The story is easily one of the more unique to come along for the genre, breaking all the zombie rules, but working pretty well. The first bit of the film is a bit slow, but not in an all bad way. As it moves forward things start to pick up a bit as the audience is given an inside look at the zombie's side of things. There is little explanation as to how the change really occurs, but makes little difference other than being a bit irritating. In addition there are some disconnects here and there in relation to how people would have acted towards a situation, but it is minor enough to not hurt it. Besides that this film works pretty well. It keeps itself pretty light, even during the darker moments and somehow manages to deliver an effective love story.The looks of the zombies fit the idea and feel of the film really well. They aren't overly gory like the norm, but can't be for this story to really work. Instead they introduce the Bonie's, which are skeleton type zombies that are there just to feast and kill anything in their path. The effects bringing these guys to life works pretty well and adds the much needed kick to keep it from being slow and sappy. If you are a zombie fan, then you will want to give Warm Bodies a chance. If for no other reason as it takes the genre into a fresh new direction, even if the characters are dead and rotting.",7,0,2,14 February 2013
