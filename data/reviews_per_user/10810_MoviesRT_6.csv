Requiem for a Dream," Typical Hollywoood - effective, but not very realistic.
","I know there have been a lot of reviews written on this movie and I agree with many at the many holes in the plot. It's very artistically done with the sound effects and special closeup filming, but it goes way out in left field on content.Perhaps that's on purpose. Just like Reefer Madness was created to scare pot smokers, this will scare drug users of any kind.I think it started out good and built up very nicely, but towards the end it got to be too much to believe.Firstly, how many doctors will put a woman on 4 different weight loss pills and not care to monitor her progress or stop her from taking too many? Secondly, any drug user would have to have the sense to know to use a different vein after a while, wouldn't they? And thirdly, why does a perfectly attractive young lady end up being forced into prostitution when she could work for a living? Lastly, no health-care system will take an old lady and force feed her and then put her on electroshock treatment without really knowing what's wrong. At least not in the US, but that may be changing soon.Perhaps this is where health-care in the US is heading now. Who knows? All in all a craftily done movie, but not worth much more than a 6/10.",6,2,3,23 October 2013
Interstellar," Makes 'Lost in Space' look like a masterpiece.
","My goodness, where do we start?First of all, the many 10's this got must have come from the cast and crew or a bunch of people with the scientific knowledge of a 3-yr-old.Nolan must know nothing about real science. He bandies 'worm-holes' and 'anomolies' around like he really knows what they are.Had there not been so many high paid actors in this it probably would have never been filmed at all.Just shows that putting big Hollywood stars in a movie doesn't guarantee a good product in the end.I won't go into all the flaws and idiotic ideas mentioned, but just imagine a movie with less scientific expertise than the old 60's show 'Lost in Space.' Will Robinson and his robot were more believable than anything shown in this laughable attempt at a science fiction movie.The biggest irony is that the whole point of the movie was to save humanity as soon as possible by finding a new planet to live on, yet they didn't even get back the first time for 23 years and when they return nothing has changed on earth at all. His kids are grown, but they still live in the same run down house and Michael Caine, who was about 80 when they left seems not to have aged at all when they get back. And the crops that were supposed to be dying off causing the death of humanity all look exactly the same. Still acres and acres of corn fields waiting to be harvested.Every time they tried to say something intelligent, the audience laughed. No one in the theater took this movie seriously at all.Sad because they might have done so much with this idea had they incorporated people who understood space travel and general science.Bottom line: This was a low budget script with a load of expensive actors. What a waste!!",1,12,26,12 November 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," WOW - gotta see it in 3D !!!
","I remember the 2002 Spiderman and I loved the way Sam Raimi directed by putting us right there within the action. I loved it then, but the technology today is so good that you absolutely HAVE to see this in 3D.Fantastic effects. My wife ducked a few times when things came flying at us. Really well done and entertaining too.Admittedly, this is the first of the new 3D movies I've seen, but it's definitely worth seeing this way. I'm sure the movie is good without the 3D, but I may never find out until it comes out on DVD.There's no need for spoilers. I heard it follows the original comic book story, but I don't know since I don't have any way to compare.Just get your 3D glasses, buckle up and hang on for the ride !!",10,3,10,22 July 2012
The Conjuring 2," Fantastic horror - very rare these days
","I wanted to say WOW, but someone beat me to it.I watch a lot of horror movies and most of them are just plain crap. I saw 'Darling' and it was stupid; 'Holidays' were a bunch of idiotic gory stories that made no sense, but this movie had it all.It had real characters and they were developed well enough to care about what happened to them. It was even touching in parts.But the main thing is that it delivered on all levels.Here's my spoiler: there seems to be a common thread in all true haunting stories. It seems that when someone dies and doesn't go to the light for whatever reason, it leaves a door open and demons seem to get in. They then try to use that ghost to attack others. I've seen it in dozens of true accounts of hauntings.Hope this doesn't distract you from seeing it because it's very well done. Lots of scares and when you have characters you really care for it makes it all matter even more.Not like those horrors where you hate all the idiots running from the killer and you can't wait for them to be killed off one by one.Anyway, I liked this movie a lot. I hope they do more like it.",10,1,4,14 July 2016
The Adjustment Bureau," Really really stupid
","I was looking forward to seeing this, but was very disappointed when I finally saw it.Damon is a pretty good actor, but in this he was like a wooden doll. The love scenes were as though the lady was kissing a mannequin. The reason I note this is because most of the reviews talked about how romantic this movie was. (I'm glad real romance isn't this bad.) And not to pick on Damon too much, but did anyone see him run? We burst out laughing at the way he runs. He's runs like a robot or something.Anyway, the movie made no sense whatsoever. At one time the members of the bureau said they were kind of like angels, but never said any more about what they were. They weren't human, but there was never any explanation as to what they really were.They were definitely fallible, so angels or messengers from God would be out of the question. So we still don't know.Actually, I loved Matt Damon in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' where he played a very creepy gay guy, but in this he seemed to be phoning it in. Maybe his acting days are waning? That's sad if so.",4,0,3,1 November 2011
Annihilation," What a letdown
","For some reason I thought this was going to be an intelligent cool sci fi adventure. Boy was I wrong.This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. And it runs at such a snail's pace you may start to doze off in the theater.Several people have listed all the scientific and logical inaccuracies, so I won't bother since they are numerous.Just a few nits...Why did it take 500 rounds of ammo to kill a gator. And what's the deal with that giant rat with no skin on it's face? And then that alien robot at the end. And how about the plants that grew in human forms? How ridiculous is that? The reason was given as the radio waves reflecting or something equally silly. We never find out what it is exactly and it self destructs for no reason.Sorry, but this was too stupid to give any higher rating than I did. It deserves a zero rating for wasting our time and lowering our IQ.I knew it was silly from the first dialog in the classroom where she states that some lone cell roamed the universe for billions of years looking for a home. Or some such nonsense. Are students really taught this in science classes today or is this Hollywood's belief system?The movie is geared for the uninformed and those who were never taught any real science.They throw out scientific terms to explain unreal phenomenon, but it's all gobble de gook.I'm sure many will love it, but to those who know real science it will look like a really bad cartoon.",1,1,4,3 April 2018
