Skyfall," Great Film For The Dramatic Arts
","The acting is completely superb; Judi Dench, Daniel Craig et al really sell the movie.The directing is strong too; Mendes really creates good pictures and I'll be surprised if some of the iconography doesn't start pitching up in the popular press anyday soon.Adele's song is a great vehicle for the film and overall I really enjoyed it.For me though, as I said at the top it is the performances that really carry the film. Javier Bardem adds some new colour to the franchise and is the best baddie that the Bond team have had for a while. Naomi Harris was absolutely delicious as Eva and it was probably good that some of the bump and grind from some of the earlier films has been consigned to history.Bravo all round.",8,0,5,4 August 2013
Lion," Technical
","I'm not going to criticise the artistic side. The technical aspect was wonderful, full vision, 5.1 Sound Surround; echoing FX cues: truly a modern masterpiece and a technical achievement. The camera-work was superb and lured and lulled the viewer. Really enjoyed it and it showed the complexity of film. The titles were clean and alluring with none of the gimmickry associated with other titles. There were lenses on some of the cameras and some tricky camera pulling which added to the film rather than detract from it. Never laboured, but with sleight of hand, Lion delivered a satisfying whole which is a compliment to the Producers, Studio, and Production Team.",10,0,2,31 January 2017
Hugo," Pension Plan
","Couldn't see the Maestro's hand no matter how hard I watched. It's very slick and does nothing wrong but it doesn't too much right either. The production values and acting are spot on but there are holes in the script and the jokes and values telegraph themselves way before.However, don't take it too much to heart (I am 48) and my niece was entranced. Nice to see The Maestro changing genres again and I hope for my niece it is the same experience I had with After Hours which virtually changed my world view when I saw it as a seventeen-year-old.Anyway, nice to see he's still working.",3,1,2,31 July 2017
The Big Blue," Good
","I had always winced at the idea of watching The Big Blue - the title, on release, put me off. Anyway, for my 48th birthday I puckered up and watched it; and what a relief I have. It's a great film...very mildly directed, but actually puts a bit of magic back into film (are you listening, Hollywood?) The acting is first-rate; and there is a great number of stars, which is good for people of a certain age (yes, I do mean me).Technically and Production Value-wise it is a peerless. Luc Besson sure knows how to place the camera for the maximum reward; and the music is faint, yet pleasing, courtesy of Eric Serra.Lovely to watch, it has put a spring in my step all day.",8,2,3,22 January 2017
