The Blair Witch Project," dumb movie, poss spoiler
","Personally speaking, I didn't think the movie was all that good. In fact I thought it was bad. Maybe it was because of the hype, but I was expecting to see just a little more scary stuff, and it would have been better if it had been 15-20 min. longer. And I saw nothing that would have made me sick, but then again, I'm a nurse and do things with the most disgusting stuff humans can produce. All in all, I thought the movie was bad, and should have had a little more you could actually see, like a flash of a person running in the woods or something like that.",2,0,2,27 November 1999
