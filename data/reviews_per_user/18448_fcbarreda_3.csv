Ford v Ferrari," The greatest movie about the greatest car ever made.
","This has got to be the greatest movie ever made about any sport. No computer CGI here. Everything about this movie was real. The acting is top notch, the driving and race sequences pure perfection and the great thing about this movie were the cars.",10,1,3,18 November 2019
Toy Story 4," The best of all four.
",WOW!!! What an amazing movie. The best of all four. Plenty of Easter eggs for Pixar fans to look for. Also a lot of great cultural references to other popular movies. Didn't like the ending although I understand why it had to be that way. Makes me want to go out and getting a Woody doll and Buzz Lightyear doll.,10,2,8,24 June 2019
Aladdin," Better than what I expected.
",What I really like about Aladdin is that it didn't try to imitate the original yet was faithful to the original. Will Smith made the role of the genie his own by putting his own stamp on the role and not try to duplicate what Robin Williams did. All in all well worth the money spent.,8,0,2,2 June 2019
