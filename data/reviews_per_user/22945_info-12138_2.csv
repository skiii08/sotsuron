Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Boor...ing!
","I can't believe that they spent all that time, money and talent on a dragging storyline like this epic abomination. Too much drunken chatting by Depp and not enough story line to hold water. The subplot of the mermaid and the holy man was absolutely lost on the cutting room floor...hook, line and stinker.Everyone, cast, crew, writers, producers, Mickey Mouse and the whole Disney monolith should make a big pass on any more sequels to this worn out franchise.Still, as always, the only bright spot in the entire 2-plus hours was Ian McShane. He could be snoring and it would be full of character and devious charm. Makes one hell of a pirate in a stormy sea of schlock.Please, stop the madness and move on to other rides at Disney World.",Null,1,2,1 June 2011
Evil Dead," Disgusting. Socially Irresponsible. Pathetic Storytelling
","This movie confirms the fact that most of the filmmakers who believe they have something to offer the public in the 'horror' genre have no 'bloody' idea how to do it. This has been the trend for at least a dozen years, or since the 'Torture Porn' phase was unleashed on the public back in the day of 'Saw' and 'Hostel.' How many human limbs can be severed is not a scary narrative. Sorry, it's not. It's merely disgusting and pathetic.Horror is a very popular genre, no question about it. I'm even a fan of it, but not when it is presented in such a profoundly vaporous way as this movie. Remember when we cared about the lead characters, like in 'Alien' or 'Exorcist.' Hell, 'Jaws' made this piece of evil tripe feel like a student film. The scariest part of this movie IS the acting.Can you imagine the look on the EFX crew when the director asked them to make it 'rain blood?' Get those rain machines cranking and spew the bodily fluid over the entire set. 'Excuse me? You want to do what?' the SPFX guys probably asked.This is a gore fest for all the wrong reasons. Perhaps, if the audience would start to walk out or, better yet, not even bother buying a ticket, we could begin to see the studios and the writers coming to market with intelligent, scary stories that can really get under our skin.I wish Fede got the memo because he did not deliver the goods. Instead, all he managed to do is show us how much blood he can spew on some really unlikable characters, and bad actors.",Null,128,265,5 April 2013
