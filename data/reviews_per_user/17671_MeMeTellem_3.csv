The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Part 1? What's the point?
","I get it. A part one is to lead into a part two, only except, this wasn't really a part one. More of a mini series stretched into a part one. Basically, Katniss is alive. Where Katniss is from the place has been demolished. Katniss tours the place. She finds a live rose in a bouquet of dead roses (an envision of Dr. Snow occurs) and Prim Rose's cat. She finds out Peta is alive and she is reunited with some of her old fellows. Together they will fight back but they don't in this part 1, they just plan to. Every time Peta appears on screen he says something that isn't true to his heart and he looks tiresome. Katniss puts two and two together and realizes he is being tortured. Katniss does a lot of starring off into a slight panic with teary eyes. Her character says no more than a paragraph of three sentences every scene. A lot of the scenes had no meaning to move the story line forward. Example: Katniss walks towards a river. She sits on a rock. Gale joins her. (or maybe visa versa) She leans her head on him. His pager goes off and Gale says something like 'they want us to come back.' He heads back, the camera refocuses on Katniss face. End of scene. Near the end, Katniss realizes Peta is being held and tortured because of her. Obviously, Katniss put two and two together but she didn't get four... YOU THINK! Dr. Snow eventually gives up Peta. Peta is returned bruised and he has a moment of chocking anger against Katniss. That is where the movie got interesting.",2,10,13,18 March 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," Not Impressed
","I used to be a regular visitor of this site because I would check the ratings to decide whether or not I would watch a movie I don't care to see. This movie is rated well above what it deserves. It started off nice. I thought it was going to tell a realistic love story. Instead, it gave what it said it wasn't, a fairy tale and a cheesy one at that.Once you get over the fact that they both have cancer, it really isn't a good movie. It seems like the fact that they are sick is the only thing carrying this movie. Some scenes were really unnecessary, rushed, drawn out and well...boring. As the movie went on, I couldn't take it anymore. So, as the lady was trying to help the girl up the ladder, I stopped it and returned it. There wasn't any love chemistry between the two main characters. It's more like they liked each other because of the fact that they are both dying. The chemistry is so forced that it couldn't fool a Disney princess.I love romance movies but this was a miss. I was expecting a heart melting story considering all of the hype over this movie. On the bright side it reminds me of the movie 'Remember me' except that was a better movie.",1,10,23,29 November 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," An Open Mind is Required.
","Now bare with me. The acting in this movie is very melodramatic. The movie didn't give Christian and Ana enough time to get to know each other; one scene she was in his office and the next, in his bed. Movies don't need to be long and drawn out but they don't need to be speedy fast either. However, there were some scenes that were quite hot. The scene where Christian says 'if you were mine you wouldn't be able to sit down for a week', when they had sex for the first time, and the first time he gave her a taste of what he likes with a bit of wine and ice while her hands were tied to the bed frame. This movie does undress its actors a lot but none of the sexual moments read pornographic. If you've read the books or noticed the previews then, you should know that Christian likes Bdsm. What was shown in the movie was more of kinky sex than bdsm. However, what was described in Christian's contract was definitely pornographic bdsm. It seems like most people have not discovered bondage,submission, dominance, and other sex forms like it until this movie, which explains why they are so grossed out. There are different pleasures out there other than regular old sex. Don't be so judgmental. It's kind of ironic. Anna too was disgusted when she researched Christian's liking but he told her she doesn't have to do anything she's not willing to try and some of what she tried, she ended up liking. She had to get out of her head and go into it with an open mind. There are some reviews on here that say 'is this what women like?'. Well that is up to the woman. Women like to feel needed and wanted and women like to give love and receive the same, or more of it. The way Christian chased after Anna was like he needed her and the way he so desperately wanted to have his way with her was how badly he wanted her. He too was falling for her but it interfered with the way he liked things and she just couldn't adapt one hundred percent. She wanted the same love from Christian that she was willing to give him. But, he isn't ready to fall in love with her. So far as Rape goes...How was Ana raped? She did not say no to him during their sexual acts, he asked her did she like this and that and she complimented him on his skills when they were done. She was free to stop at any given moment and leave which he reminded her of in the movie.",7,5,9,28 March 2015
