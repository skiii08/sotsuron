The Rock," Alcatraz has just re-opened, with a vengeance!
","A nifty old school crime/disaster film that reinvigorated and brought out the best in Sean Connery, oh and Nicholas Cage was pretty decent too, decent as in quite possibly one of his greatest ever performances. It was still the 90's when The Rock rolled into cinemas, and you can tell even now as it maintains some of the classic charm that was sadly lost as the millennium turned, in other words it's aged a bit since it was released. To use Alcatraz as the principle setting was a daring move as so many previous films had used the iconic island prison as a location before, but it was a move that paid off in abundance, one of the better Alcatraz based films in my opinion. Like so many top end films, the plot was staggeringly simple, it doesn't make you think too much so you can just sit back and let the action flow, it's exciting and at times, edge of your seat stuff, that's precisely how these kind of films should be. As good as Nicholas Cage was (and he was very good indeed) the standout performance has to go to the iconic Sean Connery, a master of his craft he brought elements of his old James Bond character to the fold, giving this character John Patrick Mason that something extra, for an old man he sure can move!Underlining morals come into play also, General Hummel the film's primary antagonist keeps a stiff upper lip through the bulk of the film's run, but towards the end he has a crisis of conscience, there's still too much goodness in him and he plans on scrapping his dastardly plan altogether..., the beginning of the end for him and his loyal followers, setting up the final act of the film. The Rock naturally gets top marks because I can't see where I can possibly mark it down, it's enjoyable, technically masterful, got a bulletproof story, great character performances, hits all the right emotions, simple to follow and most importantly, it has that iconic 90's feel about it..., great film, definitely would watch it again.",10,2,2,11 August 2017
Scarface," Cult classic of greed and excess
","Thirty four years old, but Brian De Palma's Scarface still to this very day stands as one of the all time great crime and gangster films.Its premise is staggeringly simple, a Greek tragedy that sees the rise of one of cinema's greatest 'villains', Tony Montana (Al Pacino), and subsequent downfall in sickening style. Whereas other high-end crime films e.g. The Godfather, The Godfather part 2, Goodfellas and Casino succeed with an immaculately polished story that transcends beautifully onto the screen..., Scarface threw the rule book out and redefined the generally accepted guidelines.So violent, brutal and politically incorrect, there are many faults to be found and one doesn't have to look too deep to find them, but why over-analyse such a disgustingly beautiful masterpiece?For example, the chainsaw scene where Tony and his henchmen are making a drug deal in a hotel room, the deal goes south in a hurry and Tony and his 'amigo' Angel end up chained up in the bathtub. Graphic scenes unsuitable for all ages quickly ensues, the stomach churning sounds of pain and desperation, the blood soaking into everything in sight..., no holds barred indeed!Even the romantic element revolving around Tony and Elvira, Tony and his younger sister Gina, Manny and his budding romance with Gina, they are executed faithfully, at all times maintaining the hard-hitting, all out brutal style of Scarface. Elvira, whom Tony takes as his own roughly half way through the film, has very little patience or even any real attraction towards her man, she is clearly a gold-digger who takes whoever has the upper hand in the mob world, and whoever she can score some 'yay' off. Gina is Tony's foil, genuine love, fear and and a feeling of over protection towards his little sister exists..., all the money, power and drugs in the world cannot come between the love of a brother towards his baby sister.With a 'remake' of Scarface due for release soon, that makes me a little sad, how can you better something this close to perfect? In no world can I see anybody other than Al Pacino play the title role, casting at its very finest, Alixe Gordin who did the casting for Scarface demonstrated true genius, not only by casting Pacino, but by casting the whole ensemble, Michelle Pfeiffer was fabulous, as was Steven Bauer.Yes as I mentioned there is a new Scarface in the works, but nothing, and I mean nothing will stop the allure the 'original-remake' possesses.Top marks across the board and if you haven't watched Scarface yet, do so, it's vital viewing for any film fan.",10,0,0,18 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phantom Menace? Phantom screenplay!
","It was the dawn of a new Star Wars trilogy, hopes were high, as were excitement levels, then it all collapsed in a pit of anguished cries and undeniable shock, the shock that Star Wars could become so childish. Nevertheless I found the Phantom Menace to be an enjoyable film for what it was, only the sheer thought that this was meant to be Star Wars made me wince, and keeps me wincing to this very day. Jar Jar Binks! The most infuriating piece of CGI known to man, and a disgusting racial stereotype that's about as funny as a tumbleweed, enough said.George Lucas has truly gone bonkers, I think the money he's earned and the revenue he's generated has completely gone to his head; there is no storyboard, a very weak 'phantom' screenplay, and the dialogue is a shambles, who on earth told this man he could write?The pod-race was a positive, shades of Ben-Hur only faster and more futuristic, reminds me of watching a no holds barred formula one race.Liam Neeson is a quality actor, and so is Ewan McGregor, but they suffered at the hands of no direction, they could only work with what George Lucas gave to them, and he really didn't give them a great deal.Queen Amidala played by the talented Natalie Portman was cringe inducing, not just because of a lack of direction this time, but because the character was generally appalling, like something taken out of a child's fantasy, and why was a teenager appointed Queen of an entire planet, when the society of Naboo was actually a democracy?Jake Lloyd really? A talentless child actor who only won the part of Anakin because he'd already appeared in a few different films, giving him an edge over other kids auditioning for the role. Anakin is supposed to grow up into the most dangerous guy in the galaxy, and judging from ten year old Anakin in the Phantom Menace, he's simply an autistic mommy's boy who can do unbelievable things. On a plus note, the special effects were groundbreaking, keeping with the Star Wars tradition of wowing its audience; the fight and battle scenes were truly breathtaking, like the lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, and Darth Maul, first class with a lightening fast pace that doesn't allow you to stop for breath.The one thing I truly loved about the Phantom Menace was Darth Maul, the guy oozed appeal and looked like the devil himself. What a superb idea it was to limit his appearances in the film and kill him off at the end, the one true thing they did right and they threw it away, I'd have loved to have seen Maul return for a larger role in an alternate Attack of the Clones, rather than a limited Christopher Lee come in as Count Dooku to replace him. Sadly a very disappointing return to the Star Wars universe, and the only thing that saved it for me were the special effects, the fight scenes, the pod-race and Darth Maul.",10,0,2,22 July 2017
The Hangover," Ultimate bachelor party of epic proportions
","Could 'The Hangover' be one of the greatest comedies of all time, I truly believe so! A red hot film that sets out to achieve what can only be described as immortality..., how many young men these days fantasise about the ultimate night, with the most extreme possibilities becoming a startling reality? The answer is most of them, what 'The Hangover' has done is taken every element that is considered 'cool' or 'awesome' and thrown them together into a pot (the pot of course being the film); it's dazzling, it makes your heart race at a thousand miles per hour, it makes you want to be part of the film itself... ...Bingo!Each and every viewer is invested. Regardless of age, gender or creed, you cannot deny that 'The Hangover' isn't a fine piece of film making.The acting is sublime, each of the four protagonists bring something different to the table; you have the stupid and simple Alan, the cool and trendy Phil, the geeky and put upon Stu, and the level headed and somewhat smart Doug, who just so happens to be the groom. The variation of character contributes to the overall success of the film, their styles are different but their antics end up the same, pure genius!It's pop culture at its most stylish, appealing to a main stream audience, that's why it did so well at the box office, well surpassing the general level of what comedy films average..., it was such a success that two sequels were commissioned making 'The Hangover' a trilogy of films. Opulence and elegance take a back seat, this is the modern century at its most disturbing, so buckle up and be prepared for one Hell of a ride!",10,0,0,15 November 2017
Wind River," It always ends with the truth, no matter how hard the truth may be to find
","The sparsely populated state of Wyoming is vast, and hidden away in this wonderful state lies a Native American Reservation..., rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is going to witness how rugged this place really is when she is sent to uncover the truth behind the mysterious death of a young girl. 'Wind River' is a powerfully evocative film that masterfully exploits the sense of isolation the characters have to endure each day, it's enough to send you mad, and maybe this has already happened to some of its patrons. Elizabeth Olsen, still a young and novice actress plays her role perfectly, utterly convincing in her quest to make people believe that her character is truly a rookie and that she is deeply out of her comfort zone..., at certain points in the film, she even manages to upend her co-star, the older, more experienced Jeremy Renner, who himself performs like a true master of the screen.Renner's character, the Wildlife Service Agent, Cory Lambert shows that he isn't just another tough guy, that he in fact possesses emotions and isn't afraid to let those emotions show at certain times, adding a great deal of depth to the character, fleshing him out and making him so much more believable and relatable.The supporting cast did a grand job, helping to prop the film up and give that extra sense of realism, what I particularly liked was the use of genuine Native American actors playing the Native American characters, Apesanahkwat (a bit of a mouthful yes) is a little known actor more than likely held down by film studios for his ethnicity, but here in 'Wind River' he is given his big chance to shine and he does more than a reasonable job playing the Native American, Dan Crowheart.Visually the film is ace! Clever camera tricks bring about the aforementioned sense of isolation, you could really be anywhere in the world, but alas you are only in Wyoming..., it took me a fair while to actually work out the location when watching the film ha. Overall the mystery, the main crooks of the film was A-grade stuff, it held back and held back and continuously made you think, giving nothing away other than what it wanted to give away, holding you in suspense all the way to the end of the film, keeping you invested throughout, therefore achieving the main aim of any film..., getting you and keeping you hooked. A highly intelligent film that all involved must have put a huge effort into, proof that hard work does indeed pay off.",9,1,3,15 November 2017
Fight Club," It's not what it seems
","Fight Club is one of those rare films that come along once in a blue moon, a film that challenges the very limits of your mind and hits all the correct notes in doing so. Brad Pitt gives the performance of a lifetime playing Tyler Durden, but all is not as it seems. The nameless narrator of Fight Club played by Edward Norton asks more questions than it cares to answer, but wait for it, your answer will come in due course, and while you're waiting for this revelation to arrive, you'll be gripped by a stylish, well crafted piece of film-making that will keep you hooked throughout. Tyler Durden is the kind of man you dream about, but never ever want to be , a dirty, downright detestable human being who has no morals and carries with him an irresistible thirst for self destruction.How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?A fair question that Tyler soon sets out to answer, weaving his way through society picking out the lowest of the low and those with an appetite for destruction, forming the secret Fight Club.First rule of Fight Club, don't talk about Fight Club!Inevitably the thirst to fight, reverting back to our primitive instincts, wasn't enough for Tyler, and he and his assembled group of disciples set out onto a wave of crime to try and scratch the ever growing itch. There was a difficult to get your head round, on-off romance involving Tyler and the narrator with Marla Singer, a mentally unstable woman whom the narrator met at a self help group that the both of them attended. This three way romance tied into the film's twist, but I'm not going to spoil it for you.On a side note, I thought Brad Pitt's 'soap making scheme' was pretty cool albeit grotesque, one particular scene that stands out for me was when Tyler and the narrator went to the dumpster at the back of the doctors to fish out some 'ingredients' for Tyler's soap venture, nice!A tasteless work of cinematic art, a new and inventive way of telling a story painted onto the silver screen. It was so good because it dared to be different and boy did it pay off, plus the overall acting quality was superb, the story was superb and the film's legendary twist pushed it onto a whole new level that was previously uncharted.One of the top film's of all time, if you haven't seen it then why not, essential viewing for any budding film fan.",10,1,2,26 July 2017
Monster," The first female serial killer in America
","Depressing, dark and dismal, Monster is the true story of Aileen, a prostitute turned serial killer.Charlize Theron is both stunning and disgusting as Aileen, such a beautiful actress in her other films, and in real life, however in Monster she's absolutely hideous as Aileen, the make up guys must have put a shift in to make her look this ugly. Fed up of hooking every night on the edge of the freeway, Aileen aims to turn her life around and soon meets the meek little girl, Selby, gradually the couple fall deeper in love, and both have to accept that there is indeed some lesbian in each of them, evidenced by the scenes depicting them kissing and fooling around, also they share a bed, and it is implied that they have also had sex. During this early period, Aileen attempts to secure herself a steady job , going to several interviews, but sadly, the lack of experience, and her previous life choices let her down each time and eventually she accepts that she is unemployable as a result. But the couple need money, so Aileen has no choice but to go back to the one thing she's always been good at, hooking. One night while at work, a man stops, picks her up, obviously wanting her services, but the man is brutal and vicious, beating poor Aileen to within an inch of her life, out of sheer desperation Aileen struggles free and kills the man in cold blood. A fatal mistake, and was this the end? Oh no, it was just the beginning! A light bulb went on in Aileen's head, from then on, instead of simply hooking, she would instead flag these nasty men down, take them somewhere secluded and kill them, then steal all their money, hey, it's far more profitable, plus she gets to kill nasty, violent men, what's not to like?One day she took it one step too far, by killing a cop, this proved to be Aileen's downfall and eventually she was caught, arrested and sentenced to death in court. Personally I enjoyed Monster it was just very difficult to watch, I was drawn in and became quite sympathetic to Aileen, but my heart went out to Selby even more so, a simple, frightened girl who is pretty much brainwashed into being Aileen's sidekick and partner, should've stayed at home Selby, carved out a better, legal life for yourself, and I continued saying this every time the character was on the screen.Charlize Theron won the academy award for best actress for Monster, a rightful choice, she was absolutely superb as Aileen, just as I said earlier, unattractive and rather disgusting. She was the first female serial killer in America, and her story is well told, my only snag is the runtime and the fact it could have broke the 2 hour mark rather than being a little over an hour and 40 minutes.",7,0,0,26 July 2017
Ed Wood," Worst director of all time they say? Maybe, maybe not...
","Ed Wood is an okay film, but not as great as people make it out to be..., to shoot the film in black and white was a novel idea, but I think this choice hampered the overall viewing experience somewhat, Ed Wood is an eccentric film that would've greatly valued from the use of colour, lot's of colour instead of no colour at all would've been my call, the usage of black and white was to honour the past, give the impression of realism making the film look as though it was actually in the 1950's, but no, it needed bright vibrant colours I'm afraid.Apparently Edward D Wood Jr was the worst director ever, and the film tries to explain why this is so in a bubbly, comedic kind of way..., but after seeing the film, I'm not quite sure, was he the worst director ever? He sure did make some lousy films granted, but the guy had passion and belief and personally I believe there must be worse out there, Wood was a nice, relatable character expertly portrayed by the sublimely talented Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp is a master of his craft, I'm always mesmerised by his performances, he brings something very real out even if his character is very outlandish..., making Depp one of the most talented actors ever most probably; and that poses a question, one of the best actors ever playing the so-called worst director ever, hmm, was Edward Wood actually that poor? Or was Johnny Depp that good at bringing his character alive?Who knows?The supporting cast fitted into the overall project very well, I was particularly impressed with the late wrestler, George 'The Animal' Steele, watched him as a wrestler as a youngster, didn't know the guy could even talk, wow, first time I think I've heard the animal say anything. Enjoyable viewing most certainly, but it fails to reach the lofty heights so many people have given it, am I not seeing something that so many others are? Am I really that dull?",7,0,2,25 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Empire crumbles..., for now...
","Chronologically Return of the Jedi was meant to be the last we saw of Star Wars, until Disney poked their nose that is.All the loose ties were resolved and the story reached its inevitable climax, Darth Vader redeemed himself and the Empire is no more.Many people slate this installment labeling it the weakest in the saga, but if that is true and Return of the Jedi is the weakest, then that simply illustrates the overall quality of Star Wars, it is still a world class film.If Empire Strikes Back was a dark and gritty film, then Return of the Jedi is the polar opposite, it is more palatable and aimed more at a younger audience, Ewoks anyone?The first portion of the film, taking place back on Tatooine, is well worked, staving off the main focus momentarily to indulge in the disgusting world of slug-like Jabba the Hutt, yes there is a reason woven into the main story for this, our heroes have to regroup and save Han Solo from his imprisonment encased in carbonite. The whole first act is a slow burner, hooking the audience before the second portion of the film begins.During a brief visit to the swamp world of Dagobah, Luke witnesses his little green mentor, Yoda, die, but not before a huge revelation is made, that he in fact has a sister (wonder who that could be huh?)The second portion of the film is then staged, our heroes alongside the Rebellion hatch a master plan to take down the new Death Star and cripple the Empire for good. But of course it's not that easy, hiccups along the way there are but alas somehow the Rebellion pulls it off, the second Death Star is destroyed, the Empire is indeed mortally crippled..., but that isn't the biggest story.Luke confronts his father one last time in the presence of the Emperor, mortally wounded and inches away from certain death, Luke calls out to his father, grasping tightly at any goodness that may be left in the half-man half-robot, just as you think it's all over, Vader rises up and throws the Emperor to his death, fatally wounding himself in the process.The cycle is complete, the former Anakin Skywalker has come good and redeemed himself, dying in his sons arms.Like all three of the original Star Wars films, Return of the Jedi has an ace plot and a very simple story that doesn't take much to understand.The visual effects are, as should be expected, at a very high standard: Jabba's sail barge, his palace in the desert, the design of the second Death Star, everything is immaculately polished and just looks REAL.Han and Leia's love cycle is wrapped up at the end, and we wish them a very happy life together (until The Force Awakens came along and completely spoiled it) A lovely film there by George Lucas, and not even the obligatory tampering and changes he has to make to all his film's could spoil it.You want a genuine film that can make you smile and fill you with a satisfying sense of nostalgia, well my friend just watch Return of the Jedi.",10,2,5,20 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Bring on the Stormtroopers- alternative title
","Far more plausible than the first outing of the new trilogy, still weak and somewhat disappointing I'll admit, but not as bad as people have been making out, too many fanboys moaning like little girls me thinks. Alas, like it's predecessor, Attack of the Clones comes across as far too diplomatic and political, something the original films were not, evidenced in, a large part of the film taking place in the galaxy's capital 'Coruscant', Padme, the former Queen Amidala is total 100% political, how anyone could be attracted to her like Anakin is boggles the mind. Dialogue is an issue just as it is in the Phantom Menace, the quality of dialogue, for me personally, has the same effect that running your nails down a blackboard creates, oh dear George Lucas, someone really needs to tell you that you just can't write! I enjoyed the larger role of Mace Windu played by Samuel L. Jackson, it was nice to see the wise Jedi in action especially wielding that purple lightsaber.Jango Fett was pretty awesome and added some much needed coolness to a rather lame film, it was nice to get a bit of a backstory for Boba Fett as well.Christopher Lee's Count Dooku sadly was a disappointment, would've been better to have Darth Maul back had he not been killed in Phantom Menace.The pacing was well crafted, for the most part anyway, it was smooth and jumped from scene to scene acceptably, my only fault here was those annoying screen wipes George Lucas clearly insisted on. Who on earth told Hayden Christensen he could act? Now let me get this straight, while looking for someone to play the part of adult Anakin in the new film, the casting team were instructed to find the most inappropriate young lad they could find and give him the role, is this true? Nothing about Anakin in this film was acceptable, the acting was terrible and wooden, he struggled to convey any kind of emotion, and to be honest he looked like a little boy punching above his weight and really struggling.But Ewan McGregor was much better in this film than the last, he was given more freedom to act and wasn't as restricted as he was in the Phantom Menace, plus he was the mentor in this film and not the apprentice, a role he seemed much more comfortable playing. Along with Sam Jackson and Temuera Morrison , Ewan McGregor was the only other actor I was happy with and happy to watch in Attack of the Clones, the rest of the cast was quite appalling. Advancements were made in terms of plot progression, more so than what the Phantom Menace offered, all the Phantom Menace offered was how Anakin was discovered and how he met Obi-Wan and was taken on as a Jedi, that's all that linked the film to the originals. Whereas in Attack of the Clones, there are more links, such as the plans for the Death Star briefly shown by Count Dooku, Anakin and Padme's love and marriage that would lead to the births of Luke and Leia in the next film, we see how the stormtroopers (or Clones) came to be, and we see more of Darth Sideous (the Emperor). Not the best film in the world, or even in this trilogy, but still better than the Phantom Menace..., worth watching to understand the full story of Star Wars, just try not to cringe whenever someone opens their mouth.",7,1,1,24 July 2017
Predator," Get to da chopper!
","Well this really sums it up doesn't it? Action films from the 80's are in my opinion unparalleled, no other period in film making perfected the genre as well as this glorious decade did, and 'Predator' was one of the best. Probably the joint biggest star in Hollywood at the time, it either had to be Arnie or Stallone didn't it, and in this film it was Arnie who got the nod; pure testosterone fueled manly action in a time before action heroes became weak and filled with needless emotion, as is the case in today's world. The acting itself wasn't exactly great, but who cares about that, this isn't a quintessential period drama, this is pure bad-to-the-bones action nothing more, throw in a bit of the old sci-fi and you've got a winner. 'Predator' is a proper popcorn muncher, the action is raw and doesn't stop for a heartbeat, it just keeps going and keeps going, characters are disposed of periodically by the mysterious predator, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout; yes there were other 'Predator' and 'Predator' related films over the years, but nothing will ever beat the original. Particularly I enjoyed how they kept the titular villain hidden behind a wall of invisible energy, this greatly added to the suspense by not giving away the creatures appearance, it allowed your imagination to do the work, something a lot of modern film makers don't seem to understand. Other than the obvious predator itself, there was very little in the way of special effects, the film instead relied on raw, gritty realism to convey the action, again something a lot of modern film makers don't seem to understand. Definitely a one to watch for any film fan, just sit back and enjoy.",9,1,6,20 January 2018
Justice League," Poor man's Marvel, where's the Justice?
","'Justice League' was the film everyone was waiting for, a year's worth of speculation and a year's worth of hype, for what? Overall the whole production looked rushed, the story was weak, the superhero ensemble fell flat, this is a film that should've been shelved for longer, wait until each of the five characters had their own independent film released to give some semblance of a backstory before releasing this 'Justice League'. Ben Affleck is about as unconvincing a Batman that you're going to get, he's had a lot of stick about this role and rightfully so, he's no Christian Bale, heck he's not even Adam West, he just plain sucks at being Batman!This 'Justice League' looks like something that would've been produced back in the nineties, maybe with Val Kilmer still playing Batman..., the CGI was terrible, reminiscent of the early days, the villain was plain rubbish (couldn't they have come up with a better villain from the wide scope they have to choose from?) the CGI and performance of said villain was woeful, borderline insulting.This is perfect proof that the comic book genre is feeling the effects of a burnout, there's only so much you can do before you end up overdoing it..., the DC expanded universe is seriously suffering and cannot get anywhere near the standards that their rivals Marvel have set, if I were DC I'd take a few years off, count my blessings, and rethink my strategy because there's got to be a better was of producing films and creating an expanded universe than this. Granted it's not a bad film as film's go, but with all the hype and all the potential that this film had, the end result is staggeringly disappointing, I expected a lot more than what I was given.",5,1,1,18 January 2018
Independence Day," We stand together, this is our Independence Day!
","One of the first modern blockbusters, Independence day is a landmark achievement in film-making and made mega-money at the box office. A perfect story and a well told narrative to celebrate the Independence of America, as well as tackling the situation of an alien invasion head on; the formula of the story is a mixture of spectacular action and the human psyche, instead of mindless in-your-face grandeur, Independence Day opts for a more humane approach, adding tension and heightened emotion to the score. Unlike a whole load of other sci-fi films, in this film the physical appearance of the actual aliens is purposely limited, what they look like isn't important..., they limit this to a couple of scenes most famously in Area 51 where the alien attacks the doctor in the lab. In all honesty I believe this film to be Will Smith's finest, I see the man as a limited actor who hasn't got the greatest set of skills, but in Independence Day the guy was near perfect, embracing his role as Captain Steven Hiller with gusto and possesses an air of confidence unrivalled by any of his other film roles. The supporting cast most notably Jeff Goldblum's David pulled their weight with enthusiasm, each of them had a required sense of urgency about them, choreographing their characters so they fit handsomely into the bigger story. The premise seemed a little bit outrageous, this wouldn't happen in real life, if aliens did invade then the situation would be tackled very differently than how it is in the film, hence the story was tarted up for the big screen, overly elaborate in every department, this isn't a problem though because it's a fictional film and in every fictional film, there are deep exaggerations bordering onto the far-fetched. The recent sequel of Independence Day doesn't hold a candle to the original, the sequel does everything it shouldn't, resists no temptation and appears to be glorified and therefore terrible, not so with the original, this film has clear boundaries and doesn't dare to cross them once, twenty years apart? The equivalent of a million years in Hollywood, and can't you just tell the difference in quality between the two films.One of those films you can watch again and again and never get tired of, that's the mark of a top quality film..., one of the finest films of the 90's you'd be hard pressed to miss it.",10,1,2,17 August 2017
2012," So 2012 was the year it all ended!
","I've heard a lot of bad things about the film 2012, but I have to disagree because for me it was a smashing film, exciting, edge of your seat stuff!The CGI and special effects were top class, the crew made full use of what was available..., okay it may have been a little CGI heavy, but in a film like this with the world as we know it coming to an end, the film benefited from having so much in the way of visual spectacle. The acting, granted, was a little rusty and you could expect better from the talent involved; the little girl Lilly, played by a very young Morgan Lily was probably the worst of the bunch, the girl can't act and was constantly getting on my nerves, coming across as a spoiled brat.There were probably better actors to take on the lead role of Jackson Curtis rather than John Cusack, but he did his best and gave what I believe to be the finest performance of the whole film. On another note, what's with the name Jackson Curtis, sounds more like a rapper! Overall the film felt rushed, but that isn't exactly a bad thing, when the world is coming to an end and everyone's dying except for the privileged few, every last thing in that world is going to be rushed, everyone is going to be at panic stations not knowing what to do for the best; so the quick pace of the film and the action added to the tension and realism. I put 2012 up there alongside Independence Day as my favourite disaster films, it really is fun to watch, so ignore all the pessimistic reviews slating the film for one reason or another, and just sit down and enjoy 2012 for what it is.",8,2,3,26 August 2017
Wimbledon," And it's love to serve!
","'Wimbledon' is a charming little rom-com that relies more on the actual sport than it does on the romance; maybe that wasn't a bad thing, as the sport of tennis and the grandeur of the Wimbledon grand slam tournament get thrust into the limelight and received some extra exposure via Hollywood. Paul Bettany shows off some super acting talent playing the roll of a posh pro tennis player who is coming towards the end of his career and has dropped to 119 in the world rankings.On the other end of the spectrum we have Kirsten Dunst who's character is just starting out in her career, a girl with big ambitions who has already set her sights on winning Wimbledon, with help from her overbearing father who also manages her career. Sadly the two young leads don't particularly share a vast amount of on screen chemistry and watching them share the screen together felt a little awkward, in a romance film the couple have to appear to really be in love with each other and the viewer shouldn't have to suspend their belief, sadly in 'Wimbledon' this wasn't the case. The vast majority of supporting characters seemed to be critically misplaced, none more so than the cameo appearance by British sitcom star, Robert Lindsey, for the life of me I cannot understand why he was cast in this film. The one stand out supporting star was Pete's (Paul Bettany) younger brother Carl, played by a young James McAvoy, his on-screen time was minimal but he added some much needed comic relief, such as the scenes in the bookies when he insists on always betting against his brother in his matches. Not a great film by any means but completely inoffensive nevertheless, a decent enough film to watch if you're bored and happen to come across it on TV, Netflix etc",6,0,1,12 November 2017
A Bug's Life," For the colony, and for oppressed ants everywhere!
","A Bugs Life was Pixar's second offering after Toy Story, and who doesn't love a bit of Pixar? Even as an adult A Bugs Life is a film I can watch over and over again, it just has that charming appeal that is attractive to adults too!The animation is superb, high-end, spectacular and oh so colourful..., no it doesn't look 'real', but actually it looks 'better' than real life does, I like how in animation, particularly with Pixar, they create such life like characters and backdrops while maintaining the allure that animation duly brings. Flick, the ant and protagonist of A Bugs Life is highly relate-able, a struggling inventor who strives to do right, but inevitably ends up doing wrong, such is so, that in the first act of the film, Flick's latest invention, the harvester that can slash production time in half, misfires and causes some serious chaos. This mishap lands Flick in some serious hot water with the ant council and Flick voluntarily banishes himself from ant island, to which the council agrees.The action heads to the 'city' (a dirty little place under someones trailer), there Flick seeks out warrior bugs, and finds them in the form of Slim, Francis and the gang.The gang, including Flick head back to ant island, where the majority of the film will now take place, ups and downs and lovely subtle comedy ensue, resulting in the island hatching a plan to take down Hopper and the evil grasshoppers.Call me a baddie, but my favourite character was actually the films baddie, antagonist Hopper, he was so cool, but in a toned down kind of way, nothing genuinely nasty, like all lifeforms he's simply doing what he needs to to survive.The music was typical of any Disney or Pixar film, perfect in other words, it evoked excitement and calm at the same time, never once getting out of hand or too much, perfect for kids.Nature, the very essence of the plot, nothing in the story was false, every element was true to how would be in nature, only in an exaggerated way, oh so simple, to produce magic from a story so simple shows true genius, and they don't get much better than Pixar.As for the ending, a little weepy for the faint hearted, as the bugs and the circus they are employed by disappear off into the sunset, their work complete, Flick, the newly appointed Queen Atta, and the newly appointed Princess Dot watch on as streams of wheat act as fireworks being propelled into the sky and the whole ant colony waves goodbye. The ending was as simple as the rest of the story, and it just worked completely.Altogether an outstanding film, very enjoyable and one the whole family can watch, plus the runtime isn't too long (as with all Pixar films).",10,0,0,21 July 2017
Pulp Fiction," A Royale with cheese please!
","An epic landmark in film making brought to you by everyone's favourite madman Mr Tarantino..., Pulp Fiction is one of the most influential films of the last thirty years and maybe of all time. Quentin Tarantino became a cinematic auteur after only his second film and lay down the yard stick for which all other directors strive to be; a completely original film like nothing seen before, revolutionary at the time and still revolutionary now, maybe more so?It non-linear form of storytelling was a masterstroke, adding something unique and dynamic to the crime story contained within, on the surface Pulp Fiction's plot would've been samey and flat if not for the magic Tarantino threw at it.On a whole other level is the dialogue, Tarantino's legacy will include his unique approach to making everlasting and brilliant dialogue, Pulp Fiction is the perfect example of realistic yet overly tongue-in-cheek usage of the spoken word. The opening scene with Jules and Vincent driving along to their next job is a shining example, talking about the most obscure and silly things like what do Europeans call a quarter pounder with cheese..., a Royale with cheese, because of the metric system, in my view this is one of the greatest quotes in cinema, stupidly simple and random but so effective.The acting is sublime and masterful, John Travolta's performance alone relaunched his career and made him an A list star once again..., it also has to be the shining light in Sam Jackson's career, he was given the ball and he ran with it truly, announcing himself to the world in the process.The side story involving Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge added another amazing dimension to an already incredible film, and Tarantino expertly linked the story in to the rest of the film like a pro.Cinematic excellence and it just goes to show how well independent films can be if you give them the chance, an independent film by a relatively unknown at the time director has gone on to become one of the most critically acclaimed films of all time and for very good reason.Essential viewing for any budding film fan, a film that must be near the top of every list..., one of the best ever, I salute you Quentin Tarantino, cinema is a better place because of you sir!",10,2,3,11 August 2017
The Shape of Water," Oscar-bait
","You cannot hide its many flaws, sure 'The Shape of Water' is a cinematic marvel, beautifully shot and brilliantly made, but it screams of Oscar-bait, how much do you want to bet that this film will scoop up at least over half a dozen Oscars at the Academy Awards? It's unoriginal, just a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, only under different circumstances and a completely different context..., it is a good film, but I refuse to be drawn into it and jump on the hype band wagon. What was a wonderful part of the film as a whole was Sally Hawkins mute character, the fact that she cannot speak adds another dimension to the story not to mention the romance aspect. Normally acting without being given the ability to speak is a rather daunting prospect, it evokes memories of the old silent films when actors couldn't speak, but Hawkins does a grand job making Elisa empathetic and believable, well done her.The other cast members were neither here nor there..., Octavia Spencer was given a supporting role that was always guaranteed to land her a Best Supporting Actress nomination (Oscar-bait once again), but in my opinion she hardly did anything noteworthy that makes her deserved of that nomination. It's becoming more and more apparent that top films are gradually turning to Sci-Fi and Fantasy, utilizing at least some of those genres tropes to make the films more appealing and attractive to the changing cinema audience, suddenly Sci-fi, Fantasy, Superhero and Comic Book genres are all mainstream, whereas in the past only 'geeks' and 'losers' were attracted to them..., how the world changes...Guillermo Del Toro is an amazingly talented film maker and he has truly shown his worth with 'The Shape of Water', it's a dang shame that I couldn't take to it like so many people have.",6,4,9,26 January 2018
Hercules," Herc is our hero, oh yeah he is!
","Part of my later childhood and I'll never forget Disney's Hercules, I also liked the video game of Hercules, used to play it on the original PlayStation.Disney took a well known Ancient Greek tale and made it their own, Hercules never looked better than he does here in animation; the colour of the whole film is vibrant, striking and oh so pleasing..., perfect for kids and probably a secret pleasure for some adults too hehe! Tate Donovan isn't exactly the most well-known film star out there, but he does a marvellous job of voicing the titular hero, he brings an innocent, childlike quality to the Greek warrior, making him more realistic and relatable compared to other portrayals of the same character.Susan Egan has a wonderfully sweet voice making the character Meg seem vulnerable and generating an awful lot of empathy towards her, she is the ultimate damsel in distress and you just now she's going to end up with big Herc at the end of the film (well of course, durr...) James Woods, an acclaimed actor toned it down considerably for his portrayal of Hades, the God of the underworld and the film's antagonist, it's probably the most camp and least threatening version of the character ever, oh but again perfect for kids!My favourite though has to be Phil, voiced by the legendary Danny DeVito..., the little guy is like Herc's mentor, his guardian angel if you will, he provides a lot of comedy relief and elevates his portions of the film considerably. Hercules contains a brilliant musical score, typical of Disney films, evoking the correct emotions and tying into the action appropriately, Herc is a hero is the defining song and sheds a perfect amount of light on the Hercules character. The film was released during the period when Pixar was beginning to find its feet, Toy Story was released two years prior and A Bugs Life and Toy Story 2 released in the coming years, with classic animation in less of a demand and computer imagery starting to take over, Hercules did well to succeed and garner the critically great reception it did. Disney always knows what it's doing and you can always count on them, and Hercules is no different, a lovely film albeit tame and you shouldn't let it slip through your fingers.",10,5,5,16 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The end of the saga, or is it?
","Ah at last we have a decent prequel movie, probably the only one of the three prequel films you could actually label as good. The new trilogy ends on a high note and wraps up all the loose ends established in the previous two films, setting sail for the nineteen year void that separates the prequel films to the originals. Despite having a reasonable runtime (2 hrs 20 mins), the pacing was a little off, the story, the plot development, it all felt a little rushed to me, like they were trying to pack in as much as they could, knowing this was their last chance.For example, Anakin finds out Padme is pregnant, this could have been a very in depth plot point that was actually shaved rather thin, Anakin had a lot of other things to do in 2 hrs 20 mins, save the Chancellor and fight both Count Dooku and General Grievous, get involved in Palpatine's dark dealings, run about like a madman throwing a paddy at the Jedi council, oh and the small matter of turning to the dark side, pledging his allegiance to his new master and turning on his old master Obi Wan, travelling across the galaxy to wipe out the separatists, this after killing off the Jedi in the temple and the kids (he killed kids too, that couldn't have been easy); hence forth, how on earth was there time to flesh out the romance and pregnancy angle with Padme? The guy was already working some serious overtime as it was. And that exactly is my point, rather brilliant film, spectacular would be a good word, but it was rushed, a lot of scenes and angles had to be shortened or cancelled entirely to fit everything that needed to be in, in. The special effects, well what do you say that hasn't already been said, otherworldly, ahead of their time even..., again here's an example of how you can have too much of a good thing, the CGI, special effects and the like dominated the film, every scene, every frame, everything was in some way CGI, even more so than the previous two films.The most annoying thing about Revenge of the Sith, just like the other films, was the dialogue, every time someone, or something, opened its mouth, it was cringe inducing, oh George you still haven't learnt have you, you can't write for toffee, stick to what your actually good at please and leave the writing to the professionals. The dialogue just comes across as wooden, even when characters are trying to be serious. On the planet Mustafar, before Anakin and Obi Wan started to duel..., what an epic cinematic moment that was, something we'd all been waiting for, and yep you guessed it the shoddy dialogue reared its ugly head and ruined it.But, at least no Jar Jar Binks, barring one cameo appearance in one of the last scenes of the film. I was hyped up and beyond excited to go see Revenge of the Sith when it first came out, me and my friends went the first night it was released to the general public in fact, and to be honest, I was excited and totally buzzing coming out from seeing it, for all its faults of which there are many, it is simply a cool film that you can easily ignore or dismiss the faults and just let it flood your veins and pump you up.The only one of the prequel films I have given top marks for, but it's so much better than the other two films and I really did enjoy it.",10,1,1,27 July 2017
Wonder Woman," I wonder, woman, I do wonder
","Hype-tastic! For months my desire to watch Wonder Woman was so bad it was practically at fever pitch, the trailers looked stunning, all the hype I was reading into got me buzzing.Then I watched it!Meh..., now I'm not well educated on the wonderful tales of Wonder Woman, or any other comic book superheros for that matter, so I write this review rather ignorantly. I didn't get it, the very start of the film looked promising, as young Diane Prince gets trained up by the amazons and becomes a proud, highly talented amazon herself, this part of the film was fine, clearly inserted to give some semblance of a backstory for casual viewers like myself.But then it all got messy, very quickly, and at this stage I became lost..., an old war plane crashes into the ocean and Diana swims out to rescue the pilot, where did this plane come from, well through a void in time and space of course, or that's the way it seemed. The pilot becomes the co-pilot of the film alongside Diane, and both sail out to sea, and suddenly ends up in what appears to be New York (is that right?) Before long Diane is drawn into the first world war in Europe, believing the mastermind behind the war is a God called Aries, who must be stopped and destroyed.I could go on, but yes I know it's a superhero film and it doesn't have to make sense, but Wonder Woman was really far-fetched and I struggled to accept it.Firstly, why would Diane (Wonder Woman) get drawn into the first world war? She lives in a beautiful paradise with her own kind, wouldn't she stay to protect her own kind rather than, yeah, you get it..., maybe I'm just not clever enough to understand the nonsensical weirdness of superhero worlds.Alas there is some positives to take from Wonder Woman, the whole presentation and cinematography was phenomenal, lush, vivid colours in Diana's home land, gritty, worn torn and overtones of dull and dreary darkness in war torn Europe. The action scenes were mildly enjoyable, and Gal Gadot does her utmost best to portray a convincing Wonder Woman, she's no Lynda Carter I'll give her that, but she was a good fit nevertheless.One more thing that bugged me, Diana's accent, I know Gal Gadot is of Israeli origin, but she doesn't even try to do a convincing American accent, yes I know Diana isn't American, but when in 'disguise' during the film, trying to portray an American while teaming up with Chris Pine's spy character, wouldn't people notice her accent and realise she wasn't actually American? Indeed all the hype fell well flat and left me a tad disappointed shall we say, like a kid at Christmas expecting a new bike, but what he actually get's is a new jumper, boohoo! DC just can't keep up with Marvel can they? Alas they will keep trying well into the future.",4,2,9,21 July 2017
Mother!," Artistic negligence leaves a sour taste
","'Mother!' is a film that tries to be something that it really isn't; I understand the artistic side of film, I'm educated enough on the world of avant garde, yet 'Mother!' fails badly at trying to impress a mainstream audience, an audience who seemingly cannot grasp what the film is all about.This is a miserable attempt at Hollywood trying to give its audience something that it isn't ready for, trying to soften the blow by casting well known leads Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, as well as Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer..., it can only be described as a failed experiment.The overall quality of acting was poor, terribly wooden and unconvincing..., in places the plot was disjointed and all over the place, it was painfully difficult to keep a track on what was going on, leading you to constantly questioning what the Dickens is this film about and why am I still watching it?Heaven knows what the director Darren Aronofsky was playing at, the camerawork was stiff and shaky when it shouldn't have been and this was a hindrance and overly distracting.They call it a horror, indeed I agree..., the film is so horrific it makes you question the morality of the film industry, who in their right mind gave the green light for this horrible little production? ...Shivers...!A complete mess, every aspect was shambolic and a total disgrace to the art of film making, consign this to the history books and keep it there under lock and key, a failed experiment, Hollywood should learn from their mistakes and not replicate such an atrocity.",1,12,18,8 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," In a galaxy not so far away...
","A remarkable, timeless piece of film making, the original Star Wars later titled 'A New Hope' continues to carry a lot of sway even to this very day.In its most basic form, the story of Star Wars is as simple as it gets..., it doesn't need to be glitzy and confusing, leave that to the special effects and set dressing. Groundbreaking, the special effects of Star Wars were ahead of their time, for example: the final battle above the Death Star, the X-Wing star-fighters looked spectacular, weaving their way around a flurry of laser-fire, both from the opposing tie-fighters and the turrets mounted to the Death Star itself, even to this day the battle, and everything else in Star Wars for that matter can hold up, whereas other films from the period look camp and dated, rather embarrassing.This is the story of a young farm boy coming of age, of a strong and heroic rebellion taking a stand against adversary, an evil empire intent on oppressing and gradually destroying a once thriving galaxy, of a smuggler and his fury companion getting drawn into the fight, of a relic of the past hiding away in the desert, rearing his head one more time to take his last stand, of a Princess from a ruined planet, trying to stay strong and do the right thing for a cause she has handed her life to. This is just the beginning of the saga, but what a way to kick things off..., it leaves the viewer gagging for part two, which sadly they had to wait another three years for.Star Wars is dirty, it's gritty..., especially the scenes on the remote desert planet Tatooine, there's no glory or finesse here, it's raw, it's dangerous, it's disgusting, a truly great way to introduce the audience to the world of Star Wars. The droids C-3PO and R2-D2 begin the story and the audience is expected to hold onto them as they slowly bring you into the deeper story, and they act as comic relief, which is kind of nice. Now for George Lucas butchering his own creation, how many times has the man taken his films and changed things, adding and taking away various things? Like a mad scientist our George is, not content with what he has created and given to the world, he finds the need to keep with the times, if something looks old or scraggy in any way, he'll change it. For example, in 'A New Hope', the lightsaber battle between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader, if you ever watched the original copy, you'll notice a staggering difference between the presentation of the light emitting swords, in the reworked and changed re-release, the colours of the sabres are vivid, both blue and red swords sparkle beautifully, however in the original, the sabres pale in comparison, they are a pathetic transparent whitish colour, this is a good change, but should Lucas keep butchering and playing about with his classics?There's so much more I could write about 'A New Hope', but I'll leave you to watch and enjoy, there's a whole galaxy of wonders out there waiting for you.",10,1,2,19 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Long live the Empire!
","How do you top perfection? Why, you go out and you create the Empire Strikes Back, that's how. If the first Star Wars is merely the introduction, then Empire most certainly is the main course, the special effects were somehow more amazing, the story was far deeper, delving further into the mythology of the Skywalker saga, 'No, I am your father!' anyone?What separates the first Star Wars from Empire,is the sheer fact that in Empire it seemed the whole cast and crew had more confidence and were far more comfortable with what they were doing. Whereas A New Hope seemed a little more shaky and adventurous, Empire exhumed total confidence, it explained more e.g. Vader being Luke's father, introduced the character of Yoda that had so far been a missing link in the story, it explained more about the great purge that had consumed the galaxy, what the galaxy had been like before the Empire through Obi-Wan and Yoda's eyes......It answered a lot of questions basically.The backdrops e.g. the locations, space itself, were kept in a similar vain to the previous film; dirty, desolate, it gave the impression that our heroes were truly lost out in the farthest reaches of the galaxy. For example, ever notice how the whole film revolved around the outskirts (outer rim) of the galaxy? And that not once in Empire or any of the original films (unlike the prequels) does the action venture into the heart of the galaxy, the heroes and the rebellion are marooned seemingly trying to fight from the outside in.For an outlandish and absurd sci-fi film, the characters are highly relate-able, in that their fight for justice is something we have all experienced in real life.On a visual note, the whole film was ahead of its time, the action in the beginning on planet Hoth was raw and other than the added additions of vehicles e.g. AT-AT walkers and snow speeders, the shield generator, echo base itself, the whole planet looked REAL, like they had landed in Antarctica on planet Earth. This contrasts Cloud City later in the film, this location looked purely CGI, nevertheless it was stunning and so outlandish, a city in the clouds surrounded by a gas mining facility, only in the realms of Sci- fi!The three main characters introduced in Empire that were absent from the previous film: Yoda, Lando and Boba Fett, all three were awesome and fantastic editions to the saga.Alas The Empire Strikes Back stands as my favourite ever film and for good reason, to find put why though you seriously need to invest some time in watching it, I implore you to do so.",10,0,0,19 July 2017
True Romance," My kind of romance
","Tarantino wrote an outstanding story/script and Tony Scott perfectly captured his vision on screen.True Romance is probably the best romance film I have ever seen, and the fact that Quentin Tarantino had something to do with it gives you the answer as to why. Ultra violent and seedy, you wouldn't expect anything less..., Tarantino seriously sprinkles some hardcore magic dust onto all of his projects creating the quality and style we are used to from him. Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) receives an unexpected gift for his birthday, a prostitute called Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), but Clarence falls in love with Alabama and vows to free and marry her, he does so by confronting her pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman) and 'accidentally' kills him. Clarence breaks the news to his new love and reveals he has succeeded in taking back her possessions from Drexl, but the contents of the suitcase aren't Alabama's possessions, it is a large quantity of cocaine. The couple agree to leave Detroit and travel to California with the drugs as Clarence's contact, Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport) can sell the drugs there. High-jinks and classic twists and turns ensue as the mob lead by Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken) want what they claim to be theirs (the cocaine) back. This leads to a rather hilarious scene between Walken and Dennis Hopper, filmed in vintage Tarantino style, having a comical discussion before Hopper is shot dead. Clarence and Alabama arrive in California where they meet Dick, his roommate Floyd (Brad Pitt) and a guy called Elliot (Bronson Pinchot), Elliot agrees to get rid of the drugs and makes the arrangements with Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek).At this stage in the film, there is a very aggressive fight, akin to domestic abuse between one of the mobsters played by the late James Gandolfini and Alabama. This scene can be upsetting to some viewers as Alabama is seriously knocked about and in a critical condition towards the end, her face is a mangled mess and her body is cut, bruised and bleeding; yet in a cinematic sense the scene is quite beautiful and one of the most famous in this very infamous film. True Romance is enjoyable because of the aforementioned 'magical Tarantino touch' or MTT for short, the guy can take literally anything and turn it into gold, there's no other way to explain why this film is simply so good, the plot is simple, the whole story is simple, but it's how it's filled that counts, and True Romance fills its story with integrate little details, paying attention and making even its slower points or 'filler' meaningful and enjoyable, this is something not a great deal of films bother with. Pop culture runs wild in True Romance, as it does in the equally enjoyable Pulp Fiction, the music, bright colours, tongue in cheek language and dialogue, it pulls no punches and holds nothing back for anyone, a complete and utter politically incorrect film. I was astounded by the amazing performance and work rate put in by Patrica Arquette, who could've guessed that in her younger days she really was a stunner? Perfect for the role of Alabama, her chemistry with Christian Slater was so convincing too, and his performance was one of my favourites of all his films. A cult classic in every sense, and a highly enjoyable film to boot, I could watch True Romance over and over and never grow tired, just brilliant!",10,13,16,28 July 2017
13 Hours," A secret that could've been catastrophic!
","Utterly compelling and outrageously disturbing, '13 Hours' most certainly isn't for the weak of heart, pulling no punches it's a realistic retelling of what really happened that day in Benghazi; director Michael Bay who has earned an unwanted reputation in the world of cinema hits back big style and I believe his newest film tells more truth than it does lies.Nobody truly knows what really happened in Benghazi, other than those that were there to live it and the government, and you'll never get the truth from the government. I'd like to say the wizards of Hollywood production did a remarkable job flowering the film up to look as intense and gritty as possible, but realistically they probably didn't need to, as the real life version was more than likely even more intense and nasty, so if anything they must have toned it down to make it more suitable for the big screen. Herein lies a vastly underrated film that should've been acclaimed a Hell of a lot more than it has been, and it gives a glimpse into what life is really like in post-Gaddafi Libya..., how unsettled and dangerous the place is, that the populous seems confused more so than ambitious and nobody knows what the future holds for the country, just a part of the much larger Arab-Spring.A cast of largely unknown actors, but rightfully so, in a film such as this having actors you don't recognise adds to the tension and the realism, whereas having a cast of A-listers would greatly mar the experience somewhat, because if you recognise the actor, you know you're watching a film, if you watch someone you don't recognise, you could in fact be watching a very real documentary, or even better, you could be living the experience in real time through their eyes. Let's just all be thankful that there were six secret soldiers based not far away that were able to come in for the rescue, because who knows what could've happened if these men weren't in fact there.",10,1,2,12 November 2017
Alien: Covenant," The Alien franchise has alienated itself
","Once upon a time a film was presented to the world that proved to be revolutionary and will now go down as an all time classic, that film of course is Ridley Scott's original masterpiece 'Alien'.Since those glory days many an Alien film has hit the silver screen, and finally, this year, we have been presented with what can only be described as the pits, Alien: Covenant is a lazy, pathetic attempt to keep the franchise alive. What makes this film worse is that it was indeed directed by Ridley Scott, the director of the original Alien film, oh what have you done dear Ridley have you seen how atrocious your talents have become?Let's start with the weak, I've seen it all before, plot. The ship 'Covenant' carrying quite a number of settlers who will make this new, perfect world they are travelling to their home, are sadly escorted by the worst most abysmal crew possible.You guessed it, there had to be a snag that takes the crew off course, this being a homing beacon originating from a nearby planet, a planet that appears to be quite the paradise. Yes the crew, abandoning their mission altogether have to investigate..., but upon arrival the planet isn't what it appears to be, danger lurks around every corner and before long, they are swamped by a swarm of xenomorphs (or aliens to you and me). Fighting for their lives, the crew are lead 'gallantly' by Daniels (Katherine Waterston) who appears to be out of her depth both character wise and in real life.Ahh yes, and after wondering for nearly an hour where Michael Fassbender was, alas the man pops up over half way through the film, coming to the aid of the Covenants crew, or was he?The only positive I can take from Alien:Covenant was the double act Michael Fassbender was pulling, playing both David and Walter, these scenes seemed carefully scripted and was well acted. Was Alien: Covenant deemed to fail from the very beginning, as the second film in a proposed trilogy, it was a serious step down from the much better 'Prometheus', and it begs the question if the second film was this bad, what will the second and last film be like, it has got to go some way to be worse than Alien: Covenant.If you're going to watch this film, please go in with your expectations drastically lowered or you'll be left sorely disappointed.",3,2,4,25 July 2017
