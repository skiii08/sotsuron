E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The best movie i have ever seen.
",If you still haven't seen this movie RENT IT OUT AND WATCH IT. Even if you're not into this kind of movie still go an see it because it will blow you away. I don't think i have ever cried more in a movie before.When i thought poor E.T. was going to die i was absolutely sobbing! And when the mother carries the children out of the bathroom and E.T. starts crying i was just crying my eyes out. Seriously though If you haven't seen it you MUST go and see it because no matter how old you are or if you're into the kind of movie or not! E.T. will touch you heart in every way. I mean how couldn't he?! He is just so cute!!,10,1,2,16 June 2008
Grease," One of the BEST movies ever.
","This is my all time favorite movie. I have seen many great movies but Grease will always be the best. Yes its corny, yes its a bit pointless but that is what makes it so good!! If it wasn't for Grease John Travolta would not be famous, he would not have millions of dollars. Grease made him who he is today. The first time i saw Grease i fell in love with the movie and i fell in love with John. Every time i watch it, it just keeps getting better and better!! Long live Grease!! They have made those ridiculous High School Musicals now and that annoys me because they are trying to match up to Grease, but Zac Efron and his Stupid 'Crew' will never be able to beat Grease. Grease is the best musical of all time. 'Go Greased Lighting you're burning up the quarter mile' Grease is the word...",10,9,16,21 March 2008
Face_Off," very well done
","My hat goes off to Nicolas Cage and John Travolta for their outstanding performance. John got right into his character as he always does and Nicolas amazed me, because i never really thought he was much of an actor but this movie proved to me he is. I was nearly crying at the beginning when John and his son get shot. I felt so sad. But has the movie went on and they swapped faces and John's character changed from being a depressed workaholic who barely had time for his family, to a sexual stuck up aggressive man. It made me realize John Travolta is a spectacular actor! But it is one one of those movie that you can't explain to other people, you have to watch is yourself and you have to watch it right from the beginning to understand it. So well done John, Nicolas and John Woo for creating a excellent action packed movie!! Incredible movie..",9,1,1,20 March 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Complete crap
","With the cheesy acting, the terrible script and the pathetic visual effects this movie is a pointless, worthless film.I myself am i a Alien and Predator fan. I like both of those movies very much. But when i saw Alien vs Predator it changed my view of things.When the predator and Alien are fighting it is like watching children play-fight! Absolutely pathetic.I am warning you now if you're an Alien and Predator fan don't watch this movie. It will ruin it entirely for you.",1,1,3,11 October 2008
