The Blair Witch Project," City Slickers
","For the first time in my life, I felt like a New Englander. While watching the students stroll around the woods, I couldn't really feel for them. First of all, they have all of these lights but they won't walk at night. I have been lost in the woods, and when you want to get home, you fight sleep and work to find your way. Also, whenever I am walking and am arguing with someone, I tend to walk faster; I don't stop, sit and pout like these babies did. Their constant stopping and camping seemed like the horror film cliche of the girl running upstairs rather than out the door.This isn't to say that I didn't like the movie, it was OK (thanks to a great ending). And despite my complaints, Blair Witch deserved the hype and box office gross because it was something new. Unfortunately, knowing Hollywood, rather than seeing this as a desire for fresh, original ideas, they will decide that what we want to see is Blair Witch sequels.",Null,1,1,20 August 1999
Requiem for a Dream," Intense
","Not since the opening thirty minutes of Saving Private Ryan have I seen a more intense piece of filmmaking. Terrific acting (Ellen Burstyn should be given an Oscar right now), hyperkinetic editing, and a tremendous score by Kronos Quartet (who also worked on Heat), Requiem for a Dream is an amazing, disturbing film. It's power made it one of the best films I have ever seen, and one film that I never want to have to watch again.",10,0,0,4 November 2000
Gangs of New York," Love Stinks
","This film had many very interesting moments, and an amazing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Unfortunately, the revenge story and the Leo/Cameron Diaz story line sinks the film, as does their on-again/off-again accents. This film would have been better served if it focused on Bill the Butcher and life in the Five Points. The picture looks amazing and one can see why it took so long to make. Unfortunately, you can also see that the script was a work in progress even through filming.I wouldn't recommend 'Gangs of New York', however it wouldn't make a horrible rental, if just to see Day-Lewis and some of the cinematography.",4,2,6,7 January 2003
