Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was a little 'compressed' but very entertaining overall
","The movie went very fast and felt compressed.  I felt like I didn't get to know anyone.  An additional 30 minutes added to the film to help expand the characters a little more would make the film almost perfect.I certainly wish that there was more to Darth Maul.  I would have liked to see much more hate and darkness from Darth Maul as well as more scenes with him.  Liam and McGregor were excellent as master Jedis.  Sam Jackson - doesn't work in this film.From the first moment I saw the cgi character Ja Ja Binks I thought to myself 'Ok, who is this guy and when does he get killed?'  I didn't care for him at all.The battle scenes - excellent.  The Jedi Knights v. The Dark Lord of The Sith battle scene - EXCELLENT.I don't want to spoil the movie.  If people tell you it sucks and not to go see it - don't listen.  Go see the movie for yourself.There are some faults but the greatness of the movie as a whole EASILY makes up for it.  Don't forget that this movie is just the 1st in a series of 3 (2 more on the way.)  The first movie doesn't have to come full circle - it left you hanging on purpose.This is a movie I will definitely look forward to seeing a few times.",8,0,0,22 May 1999
