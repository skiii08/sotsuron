Kill Bill: Vol. 2," One of the most overrated movies ever ..
","I really can not image how this movie gets an 8 rating. The story is boring,  the fighting scenes are crap, the martial arts of all characters pathetic, the camera was well done, so the movie looks cool and the soundtrack is ok too, but that does not justify a high rating. I was really bored watching this movie. I disliked the gore of the first movie but I loved the sceneries, in this one I was just bored. Btw I was really surprised David Carradine was not as bad as he usually is. I personally like Thurman, but she should stay away from 'Kung Fu'. She is way better in movies like Gattaca and Beautiful Girls. I would gave the first a 7/10 max, this one a 5/10. Do not waste your money only because the is movie from Mister T. If someone would donate me this DVD, it would keep it far away from my DVD Collection with movies like Ying Xiong. :P .... btw all IMHO .. judge yourself.",4,4,8,22 April 2004
Casino Royale," That was no bond at all
","OK good photography and some nice dialog do not make a good movie. No that was no bond only the first 10 min in the beginning, where they had to go with the flow and do some street climbing actionThe rest of the action was crap, the love story horrible and no toys for boys. This movie goes along with all the last bad bond movies. The new actor is good and the first minutes it looked really promising, but then what a mistake ...I really like the new actor, and the scenery was nice, but the love story part was so horrible. This bond had no special funny little toys, no Q at all, the car crashed on first use. No that was no bond, it was another action movie like 1001 we seen before .., we call it pop corn cinema but even that was not that entertaining... there will be a day, when a bond movie will rock but not this time ...OK before I leave, the movie was not that bad and the new actor plays the role a lot better then the last, he has its own style maybe I was just expecting a lot more so I am disappointed, if I would not expected that I even would rate this movie higher ..... I really miss the boys with toys stuff that was bond always and foreever",6,0,2,5 December 2006
