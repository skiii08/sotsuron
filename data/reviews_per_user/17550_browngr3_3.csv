Skyfall," Another excellent Bond flick!
","As a Bond fanatic for over fifty years, this film was not a disappointment. Sam Mendes direction brought out the Bond character as he should be. Daniel Craig was superb as always and as he was in Casino Royale. I was a Lois Maxwell fan in the early Bond films but Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny took the young lady out of the clerical atmosphere of MI6 into the depths of MI6 Field Ops. I loved her performance and she brought fun to the film with her delivery. Looking forward to seeing her in future Bond films with her as Moneypenny.The film brought out Bond's past as a child which I thought was interesting and very well done. M's (Judi Dench) demise was a surprise but the story line was great. Javier Bardem performance as the antagonist was comparable to his performance in No Country for Old Men. He always plays a great bad guy. Can't wait for the next Bond film.",10,2,6,12 January 2017
Last Flag Flying," A film worth seeing!
","This film was excellent. For a drama, it had a lot of light moments. Bryan Cranston, Lawrence Fishburne, Steve Carrell and J. Quinton Johnson were great. As a Vietnam Veteran, I related to this very well. I won't give any spoilers here but it touched home for me. A movie worth seeing.",9,76,108,28 September 2017
Casino Royale," By far one of the best Bond Movies
",I have been a Bond fanatic for over forty years and this is by far one of the best Bond movies to date. The action is excellent! No fancy gadgets that 'Q' usually supplies. Just the state of the art devices that are available today. The is comparable to 'From Russia with Love'. One of my favorites in the Bond series. I believe this movie is what Ian Fleming had in mind when he wrote the book over fifty years ago although the screenplay has changed to accommodate current events. Daniel Craig was superb as Bond. He is more like Connery than the other Bonds. Just have to get use to the blond hair. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd was a good cast. Let's see where the next Bond flick takes us with Craig. It should be interesting.,9,0,2,17 November 2006
