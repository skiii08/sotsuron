Sucker Punch," Not too Bad
","For starter I think this movie really pushes the boundaries of a PG-13 rating, but that is a side note.I loved the action sequences in this movie. Some of the CG shots are really sweet, and the action sequences are good also. The actual plot line of the movie had a lot to offer, but it would have been nice to have that story developed a little more. Instead there is a concentration on the actions scenes, which are pretty cool. The style of the movie takes a little getting used to, but ultimately it adds to the story. Finally, this movie has what might be called unnecessary hotness. What I mean by this is none of the women ever where 'normal cloths.' They wear hot looking cloths even when peeling potatoes. This is very similar to all of the 'oh by the way, Megan Fox is hot' shots in Transformers 2. This is not only wholly unrealistic behavior, it is also distracting for the average healthy male.Overall, it's not too bad of a movie, but not exactly what I was looking for.",7,2,9,26 March 2011
District 9," I can't believe so many people like this terrible movie
","I consider myself to be a lover of bad movies, but this was a different breed entirely. Sure special effect screw ups and botched lines are funny, but this movie was not that way. The production on this flick was really very good...that is, except for the camera shots that wiggle almost non-stop, but it was supposed to be that way. So, great production, great CGI, and great effects. Now, I am not a big fan of the documentary/news camera type of camera work, and that is throughout the entire movie, so that was one point against the movie right from the start. However that is just the tip of the iceberg. This movie has many parts that made me want to cringe. Many of the scenes are gruesome to a certain extent. Bad things happen to random people for no reason. Worst of all, there is not one likable character in the entire movie. There is hardly anyone to cheer for, and justice is almost non-existent. Not to mention that the movie leaves many loose ends and many things completely unexplained. I thought it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",2,6,16,24 August 2009
