Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," ........ disappointed
","This is absolutely not what I was expecting. George Lucas seems to be focusing on too much of his creatures and big (special effects) scenes rather than on the plot. The story is confusing and hard to follow. The characters were not sharped as good as those from the original trilogy. Jar Jar Binks is a big mistake with (his?) Disney cartoon character's behavior, not funny at all. But still, it is Star Wars; a classic. I will see it again because at least I'm very impressed with the fighting and battle scenes. Hope that the next episode will better, much better. Great Hope.......",Null,0,1,31 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It may not be the best, but it is a GOOD movie.....
","After reading some of the comments I can't held to put down one of mine. First of all, I wasn't born and raised under the Western culture so I don't know and I don't care how the Star Wars movies did became an important role in your movie history. And I am not a Star Wars fan also. But still, I would like to tell those who commented the movie as 'bad acting','unrealistic battle scenes','poor story-line' that perspectives are changing all the time. You can't judge a movie with today's point of view. Besides, the original Star Wars was made 22 years ago. With no computerize animation but with plastic model vehicles. What do you expect from that -- a 3D I-MAX version!!? And don't complain on the story-line if you haven't seen the complete trilogy. It may not be the best movie but there is no doubt that at 22 years ago Star Wars was a great achievement in the movie industry.",Null,0,0,27 May 1999
