The Hateful Eight," Quentin F@KING Tarantino
","I think Quentin Tarantino cannot make a bad film. There is a lot of tension / suspense in most of the film, great dialogues and a lot of violence. I laughed so hard in some parts because stupid things happened that I had never seen in any film, which made me like the movie even more. For those people looking these days looking for a good western to see I advise they see this masterpiece.",10,5,7,4 May 2020

Suicide Squad," It's not too bad but...
","I watched Suicide Squad extended version and I was starting to like the film until I started not understanding some things, maybe when I go to see it for the second time I will understand, but back to the film, I liked the performance of the characters although some could be better explored, I liked the action scenes, I liked the film's soundtrack and Ben Affleck's participation as a batman, now Joker's performance was not the best I've ever seen and they should have put him on the screen longer and of course the script was not very good.
Summing up and concluding it is a film that is not as bad as they say but it could have been much better.",7,1,2,14 May 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," 'The Show Must Go On'
","This is one of those films that I couldn't miss in the cinema because Queen is simply my favorite band and this film is simply a masterpiece, the cinematography is beautiful the performances are spectacular and that final part is one of the best scenes in the history of cinema.

Alien: Covenant," A Masterpiece!!!
","This is my second / third favorite film in the franchise. Most people say that these are the dumbest scientists ever because they didn't know how to deal with aliens, or because they made stupid decisions etc ...
What I think:
They are scientists, when they arrived in that unknown land they did not know that there were aliens, that is why they did not have enough weapons for what they were dealing with as in Prometheus, that is, they were not military personnel with heavy weapons and with good preparations. , they were just scientists.",10,4,10,5 June 2020
