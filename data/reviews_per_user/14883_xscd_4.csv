Your Name.," Heart, Soul, Beauty and Art
","What a great movie, story and moving art. I didn't think that any other effort could rise to the same level as the magnificent legacy of Hayao Miyazaki, but this movie manages to follow in his eminent footsteps.The story is simple yet with many complex and fascinating details, told with so much spirit and humanity, and with such beautiful, evocative and emotionally moving art that it is easy to become entirely caught up in it and cherish it, with a gratitude toward all of the wonderful artists and others who produced this very fine work.Highly recommended.",Null,3,4,23 February 2018
Star Trek Into Darkness," An Old Star Trek Fan
","I watched the original Star Trek TV series, starting from episode 1 of the first season, when I was a boy. I've loved Star Trek in its various incarnations ever since, including these two recent movies by J.J. Abrams, who seems to have a soft spot for the original Star Trek and pays homage to it in numerous ways in both of his Star Trek movies so far.This is a very good, very entertaining and interesting movie just on its own, and it seems to me that those who are giving it horrible (1 and 2 star) reviews might likely be Star Trek purists and perfectionists who have reduced Star Trek to a static universe that never even existed in the original TV series.For example, why don't any of these Star Trek purists complain about the portrayal of the Klingons in this latest movie and in so many Star Trek movies and series before it, because the Klingons in the original low-budget TV series looked, dressed, acted and spoke like Earth humans, for example in the famous episode 'The Trouble with Tribbles.'I think that J.J. Abrams pays a tremendous amount of respect to Gene Roddenberry's original concept and realization, while allowing his own creativity to enhance the characters and plot lines typical of the original.Good job. Great movie.",9,4,6,6 September 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Better and more entertaining than the previous Spider-Man Movies
","One of the harshest critics of this movie said that 'nearly everything exists only to advance the plot.' I found myself wondering what he thinks should have filled that time instead. The movie did cover a lot of territory, so it was necessary to spend less time on some things than others in order not to be overly long.I found this movie immensely entertaining and often truly humorous, especially Peter Parker's dialog which was in my opinion very well written and well acted.I feel that only the most jaded and demanding of critics would be hard on this movie, and only because virtually nothing would be good enough for their personal standards of perfection. For everyone else, this is a very good movie, my favorite so far of the Spider-Man movies.",9,17,28,11 September 2014
Murder on the Orient Express," What a Great Mediocre Movie!
","This movie shows what can happen when you 'do everything right.'Great cast and acting, impressive sets, costumes and period details, very good cinematography, for the most part solid screenwriting and very good direction.+10 stars for all of that, and Hercule Poirot's (Kenneth Branagh's) amazing, can't-look-away-from mustache!-5 stars for a dated and contrived story, for stilted, pretentious dialogue, for seeming small and dull in spite of exotic locations and setting, and for the overpowering, compellingly distracting, scene-hogging, more-screen-time than anything else and often in nearly fill-the-screen closeup, bizarre and completely outlandish mustache of the main character, Hercule Poirot. It's hard to even pay attention to what the characters are saying, how the plot is developing, or other details of the scene when that face-rat is on screen.However, the primary failing is simply that even great talent and generous resources cannot always produce great movies. But hey, it's just mediocre, not horrendous on the scale of the 60s epically-over-the-top and scandalously-expensive mega-flop Cleopatra, starring none other than mega-stars Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison.So, kudos for that!",5,0,0,11 April 2018
