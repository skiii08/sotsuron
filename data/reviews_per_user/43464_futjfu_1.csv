The Avengers," I don't get why everyone loves that movie!
","I have to say, I'm obsessed with superhero movies! I love most of them so I was one of the most excited people to see it.I think it was alright. Not more or less. It seemed to me as if all the Avengers were redundant except for Iron Man because every time they fought, he came and made it right. I also didn't like most of the acting & Scarlett Johansson was more than a waste for the story. She just had no meaning and her character wasn't necessary in any way. I also don't understand why everyone liked Hulk so much. I think Mark Ruffalo did a great job with playing the angry professor but as Hulk? Just no.. he couldn't get a single giggle out of me. The only one that really impressed me was Loki & I loved him already after the first minutes of 'Thor'.I admit I'm not a professional review writer, in fact it's my first one so it may be really bad but I had to say that I just didn't like it. I was expecting so much, maybe that was my fault. I will watch the movie again, maybe it's one of these movies which only make an impression after the first 3 views.",4,10,25,11 May 2012
