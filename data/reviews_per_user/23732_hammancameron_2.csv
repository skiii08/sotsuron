Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3: A movie which delivers and doesn't disappoint!
","Iron Man 3 Review (No Spoilers)Hello everyone and today I'll be giving you my thoughts and review on the must anticipated Iron Man 3. I want to start off by saying how much this movie exceeded my expectations. It was a brilliant, action-filled, funny and overall a great movie, which serves the Marvel Universe wonderfully. This movie delivered on a series of levels , which only some movies achieve. It executed the emotion, action, characters, plot-development and ending spot on! We explore parts of Tony Stark that we didn't see in Iron Man 1,2 and the Avengers before. Robert Downing Junior's betrayal of the character was simply brilliant. From the start of the movie, I was taken in by the character and that draws and emerges you in the movie. We also see familiar faces such as James Roads and Pepper Potts, once again great acting delivered by Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow. The Mandarin was interesting and nothing what you'd expect from the trailers (Wink wink). The more compelling villain in the movie was Aldrich Killian. I feel that I can't go into detail of those characters, unless I include spoilers in this review, which I'm not. But hopefully you guys will see what I mean when you see the movie. The ending was great. Let again I can't go into detail what happens to kept this review spoiler free, but what I can tell you that the ending was very satisfying to conclude this movie. I would also like to say that there is an after credits scene after 60 years of the credits, but worth it. I know some people might think that I'm praising the movie too much. I'm really not. It generally was a great movie and the best Iron Man movie out of the 3 released.The verdict: Iron Man 3 is a movie which serves justice well to the Marvel universe and a great way to kick off 'Phase 2'. I give this movie a solid 4/5 stars. It had everything worthy of a 4 star movie, however it could have gone further in terms of depth to some characters and plot to get the prestigious 5 star rating. This movie levels the quality of the 'Avengers' if not a bit more, which comes to show how great I thought this movie was.Rating: 8 solid stars.",8,2,9,28 April 2013
Man of Steel," One of the Best Super-hero Movies I've seen in a long time!
","Man of Steel ReviewHello everyone and today I'll be giving you my review on the very anticipated 'Man of Steel'. First off I want to say that this movie definitely had a different tone and vibe to it when you compare it to other movies, which fall under the 'super-hero genre'. This would be obviously expected as DC like to add a more serious darker tone to their movies than Marvel do. What's the result of this? You get a summer block-buster, which makes you leave the Cinema thinking 'Wow... Man of Steel is definitely a movie that I'm glad that I saw!' One aspect of the movie that I was quite surprised at was the way how they decided to show Super man's aka Clark Dent's origin story. We see it through a series of scenes in chronological order throughout the first half of the movie, which in my opinion was a great approach. This was actually a really effective way of showing us his journey to being Super man. Take the 'Amazing Spider-man' for example, when you compare the two origin stories, they're very different. Spider-man's was a fairly straight forward story (not saying Spider-man is bad at all) However, when you compare it to 'Man of Steel', it definitely doesn't have all the different layers in place. I thought seeing the duel-narrative of seeing Clark Dent as a child discovering who he is alongside the actual movie storyline was an excellent choice. Another defining aspect of the movie has the other whelming action at times. I've read reviews saying that: 'There is too much action in the movie' and for that some critics have slammed 'Man of Steel' for it, I however, have to disagree. Some of the visuals and actions scenes in the movie were spectacular! Even better than the Avengers? Yes. At times being sat in my seat and just thinking 'Wow...' However to some extent, the movie could have cut out a 30 second action scene in some places and replaced it with another scene, which would have had a bigger impact on the story line. So in that sense less would be more, but either way it doesn't detract too much from the actual quality of the movie for me. I felt the plot of the movie was good also. Sometimes in movies (especially super hero movies) we get a vague plot which basically goes by: 'bad guy comes along, now we need to get rid off him' and we get the same boring plot. What Man of Steel manages to do is to add in more layers, situations and depth to the storyline. I feel it's a thing that DC manages to do very well in their movies. We saw that in the Dark Knight Trilogy and it works so well in my opinion. What Marvel sometimes manages to do, is to fall in the trap of the regular plot of 'bad guy comes along, now we need to get rid off him' type storyline. I thought seeing the his origin along side with the actual movie plot added more depth and tone throughout the movie.There is a whole lot more about Man of Steel I could talk about, but what you'd get is a huge essay that would bore the hell out of you, so I gave you the 3 main parts of the movie in my opinion. Just to add that I thought the acting was great too. I felt Henry Cavil really did nail his character as Clark Dent aka Super man. Amy Adams was really good at carrying out her role as Lois Lane and their relationship through the movie was great, Not to mention Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon being amazing also. I honestly can't criticise the movie too much, apart from the fact that they could have cut down on the action a little bit at times. If I had to criticise the movie further, I can't mention anything significant enough that it matters, or has a big impact on the movie so it's not worth mentioning.The verdict: Man of Steel is a movie that impresses from every angle that you'd expect from a big summer block buster! I fail to see anything you'd dislike, unless your not a huge fan of action, which would be stupid if you were to see this movie anyways. Man of Steel brings a lot more to the table that one would expect, so I suggest when you get the chance to watch it, I say take it!I give it an 8/10! 4/5 stars.",8,0,3,18 June 2013
