First Man," First Man is a masterfully shot space epic
","First Man is from director Damien Chazelle and is about Neil Armstrongs ( Ryan Ross) mission to land on the moon. But its more than that, it also follows his family life and trying to cope with the loss of his daughter. The cinematography, acting, and direction is beautiful and captivating. I was hooked to my seat throughout the whole film, actually caring about what happens to the characters.",8,0,1,21 October 2018
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," They could have just made this a clique romance, but they didn't
","The Perks Of Being a Wallflower takes risks. I was expecting a feel-good film that was sustainable for a mainstream audience and was all about a young boy trying to find his voice in this world. But it wasn't that. This film talks plot points that are hard to talk about all the while making us deeply care for all the characters in the film. And the best part is, it wasn't cheesy.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
Catch Me If You Can," Spielberg At His Finest
","Catch Me If You Can is truly excellent. The cinematography and direction were near perfect, and the witty dialog and characters make this film one of the most entertaining Spielberg films of all time.",8,1,3,20 October 2018
Green Book," Phenomenal tale of hope and empowerment
","Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are the heart and soul of this film. Along with the great cinematography and direction. Green Book confronts racism in a way that is relatable, people keeping there mouth shut instead of confronting what is going on the front of them. You know that this is a great film when you just want to punch that racist guy in the face but you know that that's not what the other character would want. In this film, it's not black and white. If a character makes a decision you take into account how the other people will be affected by it.",6,1,1,11 January 2019
