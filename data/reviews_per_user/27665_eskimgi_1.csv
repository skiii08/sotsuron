First Man," This is why I go to the cinema
","An intense reflection on one man's journey to the moon. Existentialist, vertiginous, I felt like I was there with Armstrong in the rocket, looking down upon the earth. The shakiness served to simulate that environment.What makes a man fear nothing? What enables someone to go on a journey that may end in their own death?This is not one for space nerds, though it's definitely the most realistic, human portrayals of space travel. The nationalist rhetoric is set aside not for political reasons, but for a different focus. In the greater scheme of things, we will remember the journey to the moon not as an American accomplishment, but as mankind's--and an individual's--step into the unknown. Here Armstrong is not portrayed as a jock, as many would like to imagine hi, but as the intensely private, potentially emotional recluse he showed himself to be during his lifetime due to nature and circumstance.The soundtrack is beautiful. What is less human than the waltz, so alien in the moon landscape? Deserves the oscar for best picture.",10,2,6,6 November 2018
