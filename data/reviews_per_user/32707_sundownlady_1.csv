Catch Me If You Can," What FUN !!
","I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard I couldn't finish my popcorn!  I lost it during the discussion in the principal's office about the 14 year-old Frank holding parent/teacher meetings. 
It was slow at times, but at least those moments allowed me to compose myself.  Christopher Walken, as always, was EXCELLENT!Definitely a 10 in my book",10,0,1,27 July 2003
