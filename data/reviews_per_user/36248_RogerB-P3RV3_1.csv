Source Code," Riveting sci-fi
","Riveting sci-fi thriller will keep you glued to your seat.Army Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is somehow being send 'back in time' to discover the identity of the bomber of a Chicago commuter train before a bigger explosion occurs in the same day – a dirty bomb planted in downtown Chicago.Stevens is part of a revolutionary mission that can put him in another person's consciousness (granted both of them share the same gender, body size and brain synaptic maps) during the last 8 minutes of latter life. The operation is headed by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) and supervise by Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga).Each time Stevens returns to the train at the same time and spot, he will only have 8-minutes to identify the perpetrator and use the info to prevent another catastrophic terrorist attack.It was difficult enough task in a train full of people. Made much harder with his growing fondness for Christina (Michelle Monaghan) – a fellow passenger.One of those movies that works on almost every level. Credit must go to budding director Duncan Jones, humanistic Ben Ripley screenplay and competent cast.",8,1,3,23 September 2012
