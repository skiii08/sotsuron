The Ring," A very tense, moody, scary film!
","'The Ring' is a stylish and thoroughly creepy movie that still gives me goosebumps when I watch it today. Naomi Watts is intriguing as Rachel Keller, a journalist who investigates a scary videotape after her niece's death. When she receives a call after viewing the tape stating 'Seven Days', Rachel realizes that this is no hoax, and that she must race against time before she meets the same fate. Uncovering a horrifying story as the days tick slowly away, Rachel realizes an unfathomable horror. Gore Verbinski kept this thriller's plot tight and the movie races satisfyingly to the unforgettable climax. 'The Ring' ranks with 'The Exorcist' as truly one of the most disturbing and scary movies ever.",8,0,1,23 August 2005
The Others," Scary and inspiring, with Nicole Kidman at her best
","Alejandro Amenabar serves up a deliciously spooky ghost story with 'The Others', an original and haunting tale about an English woman and her two children in a remote, dark mansion during World War II. Grace (Kidman in a superb performance) and her creepy children, who are sensitive to sunlight, have to stay inside. When her daughter Anne (Alakina Mann, who holds her own strongly, playing off Kidman well) starts telling her she can see 'intruders' in the house, Grace disregards it until she begins having terrifying experiences of her own. After the arrival of mysterious 'servants', who aid Grace in her paranoia, it becomes clear that something is very wrong within the walls of her home, and she must take matters into her own hands or something far worse could come of it. Shot in the dark and played well by all, 'The Others' is a treat of a scary movie.",9,2,4,24 September 2005
Resident Evil: Extinction," Resident Evil: Redeemed
","If you're a fan of the games, then you would have probably mildly enjoyed the first two films in the 'Resident Evil' franchise. Part one found a group of soldiers exploring an underground labyritnth of lab rooms and crawling with the undead, with only a few people making it back to the surface alive. The 'T-Virus', created by scientists working for the Umbrella Corporation was unleashed into the lab, which started the whole horror. 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' found the 'T-Virus' making its way to the surface, killing off the residents of Raccoon city, beneath which the Umbrella Corporation had built the secret lab that contained the virus. When it broke out, the Umbrella Corporation blockaded the city, attempting to keep infection within its walls.Where you thought it was over, it turns out the horror had only begun. The T-Virus, which is spread from one person to another through blood contact, has plagued the world and all of the continents have dried up, turning into barren wastelands in 'Resident Evil: Extinction'. Milla Jovovich returns with another strong performance as Alice, who was the main character in the first two films, having survived and then kidnapped and tampered with by Umbrella now. Now she's loose, fighting the undead and trying to stay alive in the Nevada desert. When Alice comes across a convoy making a desperate stand to stay alive, together they join ranks to bring Umbrella down and to find a cure for the virus.Highly unbelievable, Resident Evil manages to be an exciting horror fantasy, and this third installment is the best. The cinematography, writing, and acting are all top notch here. Director Russel Mulcahy makes this entry run smooth, with plenty of gore and scares to keep die hard horror fans interested. Milla Jovovich is still the best, the tough girl who can do anything. It's campy and fun the whole way, but with a rather disappointing climax. The action is absolutely the best here.",7,2,4,7 January 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Funny, Thrilling and Visually Stunning
","This DVD is worth the purchase just for the striking cinematography and visual imagery of this macabre film. Tim Burton uses all of his best elements in this supernatural thriller, the result being a slightly over the top but exceptional comedy horror fest.Johnny Depp is Ichabod Crane, a young, fidgety and eccentric forensics expert who is sent to the small secluded village of Sleepy Hollow to uncover its nasty secrets. At night, a cloaked figure on a massive black horse is stalking and murdering a seemingly random string of the town's residents, and clearly has no intention of stopping unless Crane can solve the mystery.The town is a series of stunning old fashioned architectures and is shot in a gloomy, dense fog. All in supreme Tim Burton fashion, the visuals and special effects especially stand out in 'Hollow'. Another intriguing aspect is Christina Ricci as the pale, beautiful girl Katrina Von Tassel, who aids Ichabod in his quest for the truth- and survival.Although it all sounds dark and it is, with loads of blood splattered over it (tastefully), the whole film has a heavy undertone of black humor and it never takes itself too seriously. When the horseman cuts off heads, they spin around before hitting the ground. How seriously can you take it? All around this a jolting atmospheric horror comedy which boasts loads of Tim Burton's creative style and spirit.",8,0,0,14 January 2008
28 Weeks Later," Very scary and visionary follow up
","28 Days Later was a jumpy, clever thrill ride which found a patient who woke up in an abandoned hospital and proceeded to discover a barren wasteland that was once London. It was all abandoned... that is, except for hundreds of infected people with 'Rage', a virus which spreads through the blood in seconds and turns a person into a savage zombie. It was totally f***ing scary and completely believable.Fast forward '28 Weeks' after that incident, and the viewer finds themselves once again in London, only this time American soldiers have moved in and done some reconstruction, sealing off the city except one small part where survivors of the outbreak can repopulate. After a narrow and terrifying attack, a young man is reunited with his children, and with the promise of no more infection from the military, everything seems to be getting back to normal. Wrong.In a clever plot twist which I won't give away, the virus manages to sneak its way back into the hopeful community, and within a matter of minutes the horror is plaguing innocent people in the most brutal way. Gore is splashed on thick and director Juan Carlos Fresnidilla keeps the pace fast and the cinematography slick. Although the editing is choppy and incoherent in some parts, overall 'Weeks' is captured quite brilliantly, taking on a whole new style from the masterful first. As equally scary as its predecessor and with a very effective ending, 'Weeks' scores where the first one did on a truly scary level.",9,2,4,28 January 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," Gory and Intense
","It's likely you're going to walk out of this hardcore movie in a daze. THE HILLS HAVE EYES is relentlessly suspenseful and downright scary... horror fans, especially those who are eagerly anticipating Alexandre Aja's work after the amazing High Tension may be slightly let down by this movie, but Aja still delivers, with beautiful cinematography and great performances from the cast, especially Dan Byrd and Emilie De Raven as brother and sister. A close family is terrorized by deranged mutants in the desert? It's a risky plot, especially coming out right after THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and other similar slasher fests... it might actually depend how some people feel about the run-down, been there done that plot to enjoy this film. This was the first movie I actually had to hold onto my seat through, though. I haven't so much fun or been so scared in a while during a horror movie. It was intensely made and will leave a mark on viewers, whether you enjoy it or",8,0,0,8 April 2006
Resident Evil," Scary and atmospheric
","'Resident Evil' was a smart and scary game. The darkness and the surprises were huge scare factors. In that famous game, you find yourself trapped in a mansion crawling with the undead because of a mistake made by the Umbrella Corporation.Director Paul W.S. Anderson makes a fast, dark guilty pleasure of a film from this game with 'Resident Evil'.Milla Jovovich is Alice, who wakes up in a creepy, poorly lit mansion at night in a remote forest. She has no memory of who she is or why she's here, but after a group of soldiers bursts in and takes her to a hidden lab underneath the mansion with them, she quickly begins to realize a terrible secret. She and the others find themselves locked in 'The Hive', an enormous, elaborate underground structure that was sealed by the supercomputer controlling it. It soon becomes evident that an experiment called 'The T-Virus' escaped into the air and killed everyone. But nobody really stayed dead. Now the remaining survivors must fight their way back out of The Hive before the door seals permanently... and at the same time they must contain the virus before it reaches the surface. The film moves at a breakneck pace, with some elaborate sets and great cinematography that sets the dark mood well for this atmospheric sci-fi thriller.",7,51,73,7 January 2008
28 Days Later...," Totally and Completely Scary
","28 Days Later... a man wakes up in an abandoned hospital to find London completely trashed and deserted without a person in sight. Well, at least not at first. A virus called 'Rage' was released after a group of people set chimps in a lab free, unaware that the primates had a disease more fatal and horrifying than any other. After one bite, one scratch, one drop of blood, a person is infected and within seconds becomes a deranged, outraged monster that only knows one thing- to attack.Danny Boyle keeps the action and the pacing frightening and totally believable in this British apocalyptic thriller. Cillian Murphy is intriguing as Jim, who befriends Selena, a woman who survived the initial outbreak. Together they find more survivors and must stay alive on their journey to a military base where they can only hope there is anybody alive- that is, without the infection.The zombies are fast and truly scary, with some great gore effects and the movie ties together nicely for a really satisfying climax. One of the best apocalyptic horror films out there, probably THE best... much better than the similarly plotted 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' or the letdown 'Dawn of the Dead'. 28 Days Later is a feast to the eyes and provides some genuine, original scares.*** out of ****",9,3,4,28 January 2008
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," It Still Keeps You on the Edge of Your Feet
","'Jurassic Park' was a groundbreaking endeavor that featured cloned dinosaurs running amok on an island paradise, terrorizing a group of scientists. Steven Spielberg returns to his dinosaur horror with a new group of scientists including Ian Malcolm from 'Jurassic Park' (Jeff Goldblum) and Julianne Moore as his quirky paleontologist girlfriend Sarah. They find themselves trapped on Isla Sorna, 'Site B', where it turns out the dinosaurs were being cloned before being shipped off to the park on Isla Nublar.In the few years since the disaster at Jurassic Park, the dinosaur wildlife on Isla Sorna has flourished and there is an abundance of the fascinating creatures everywhere. It's all good until the carnivores begin trying to eat the scientists, again. The movie is inappropriately long and it tends to drag save for the tense action sequences, but Steven Spielberg and the CGI wizards and magicians at Stan Winston studios have really upped the ante on the special effects. The dinosaurs are amazing and scarier than ever. Overall 'The Lost World' doesn't live up to 'Jurassic Park' simply because the novelty has been lost and Steven Spielberg really hams up the drama and keeps the movie running far past a point where our attention spans give up.Although the impact is still truly exciting, 'The Lost World' fails to capture the ingenuity of the first, resulting in a B movie with grade A production values, just barely passing for an edge of your seat Spielberg classic thriller that still manages to dish out the goods enough for a worthy DVD purchase.",8,1,3,18 March 2008
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Only for die-hard fans of the game
","'Resident Evil' was a scary, impressive horror film that was inspired by the famous game. After the T-Virus broke out in the underground lab called The Hive, the Umbrella Corporation tried to cover up its deadly mistake. But it was only the beginning.Milla Jovovich is back as Alice, and she's as stunningly beautiful as ever. She is the only apparent survivor from the incident in the first film, and now she's been tampered with by Umbrella. When she escapes an abandoned hospital, she finds herself in Racoon City, which has been taken over by the virus.In a desperate attempt to conceal the virus, Umbrella has the city blockaded, and Alice must team up with Jill Valentine, a former S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) officer to guide the last small group of survivors out to safety, before nuclear bombs are dropped on the city.Alice has become an unstoppable force of nature, toting guns and other weapons. She's an insanely talented martial arts expert, and it seems she can fight just about anything. With an awesome plot derived straight from the second game, the movie totally misses the mark.The camera work is hideous, especially during the action scenes, you can barely tell what's going on for the frantic editing is too much to bear. Milla is strong again in her performance but other than her and Sienna Guillory as Jill, there's barely any talent to be found in this mess, with weakly made-over monsters that barely pass for zombies and a ludricous pace. This is only for die-hard fans of Resident Evil, other than that consider 'Apocalypse' a waste of your time. The DVD really delivers though, if you liked the movie than you'll be very impressed by the loads of extras they threw in.",6,0,1,7 January 2008
"Girl, Interrupted"," Not Bad. Not Great.
","Angelina Jolie won a rightfully deserved Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance alongside Winona Ryder in this drama which documents a period of time in which a young woman experiences life in an insane asylum.Winona is Sussana Kasan, based on the real life author who wrote her autobiography about her experiences at the institution. Winona is particularly good in her role and she showcases some of her better talents here than her showy performance in 'The Crucible', another film she's mostly remembered for. When Sussana is locked away after an attempted suicide, she befriends the other girls, including sociopath Lisa (Jolie) and digs deep inside herself for answers.It's just a tad bit clichéd and the movie runs painfully long. Sussana's resolution is clear: she's not crazy, she just has to find her inner self. Ho hum.Angelina Jolie is really excellent as Lisa and she makes the movie, plus Whoopi Goldberg is entertaining in her side role as a warden with attitude. All of the performances and a deep, above average script make this film depressing and uplifting, and it truly does have some meaning, but overall it takes too long to get to the point.",7,5,7,18 January 2008
Scream 2," Cool, fast and scary, but a notch down from the first
","If you followed Wes Craven's 'Scream' intently, there's no denying you'll be craving for more of the originality and unpredictability that made it such a hit. And although 'Scream 2' is down a notch on that scale, it still hits the mark quite effectively and turns out as a fast, slick and brutal sequel that is high above your average slasher fare.Sydney(Neve Campbell, a little better acting here) is the likable, sweet heroine from the first story, in which her boyfriend and a friend were terrorizing high school students because of Sydney's dark past, which is dwelled upon in all three 'Scream' films. She has moved on to a remote Ohio college, where she is now studying to be an actress. Paranoid and traumatized, Sydney is thrown back into the nightmare when scary murders begin plaguing the peaceful campus. One by one, her friends begin to get picked off by the angry killer in the 'ghost face' suit that has made these movies a landmark in horror history. A bit clichéd and a bit less predictable, this 'Scream' is still a worthy horror film and stands on its own, whereas most sequels fail miserably. David Arquette and Courteney Cox (from 'Friends' and previous 'Scream' fame) get thrown in the mix as well, reprising their hilarious roles and on screen romance as an ambitious cop and a bitchy reporter who survived but are stalked once more alongside Sydney. Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven conjure up another awesome scarefest and the deaths are relentless and creative up to the satisfying conclusion. As aforementioned, it's all not as tense or dark as the first. But it gets points for taking on a more serious tone and keeping the murderer well shadowed until the surprising unveiling. Good acting from the supporting cast and all around good editing make Scream 2 a hit. Great bloody and humorous fun. Unique and scary, 7 out of 10.",7,2,2,6 October 2006
Jaws," To this day one of the scariest movies ever
","From the harrowing opening scene when the young girl dives in the water and gets tugged under by an unseen monster, we know this is no light and fluffy ride. Stephen Spielberg films his opening nightmare sequence so effectively that you'll be shivering until the final credits. But don't let me get ahead of myself.'Jaws' stands as one of the scariest movies ever made, even by today's standards. Okay, maybe it's a little outdated, but it still packs a wholloping bite and it still sends a shiver down my spine. The story, based on the intriguing novel of the same name by Peter Benchley, is simple, following a police chief named Martin Brody as he and the entire community of Amity Island is terrorized by a Great White shark who doesn't seem to want to leave. Spielberg keeps the story at a perfect pace and the plot stays tight and gripping, with some genuinely scary shark attacks and effects that still hold true today. Especially at the exciting climax where Brody, Matt Hooper the marine biologist and shark enthusiast, and a ragged old sailor named Quint go to tackle the beast in the blood soaked waters, Spielberg masterfully combines suspense and action and 'Jaws' leaves you shocked and afraid of the ocean long after it's over.'Jaws' is a thrilling experience in underwater terror that started the 'summer blockbuster' and still remains one of the pinnacles of modern American horror. Fans should look into the new 30th Anniversary DVD which includes two hours worth of interviews with the cast and crew plus footage from the making of the film. 'Jaws' still grabs a hold of the viewer today.",8,2,6,1 April 2008
Scream," A change for the horror genre
","'Scream' is completely entertaining and totally terrifying. In a time when horror was losing its touch, Kevin Williamson wrote this clever script and Wes Craven brought it to life beautifully, reinventing the modern slasher and still remaining better than most of the films that followed it.Neve Campbell is Sydney Prescott, a shy girl who's life is turned upside down when somebody begins murdering her friends. In comes Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and a hilarious reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox, the best character in the film) to investigate the murders and stay alive.The movie is funny and scary, with homages to famous older horror classics the entire way through, and the climax is excellently tense. A horror movie that started a legacy.",10,0,0,27 August 2005
Halloween," Still lives today
","With a simplistic story and an engaging heroine, this was the horror movie that started it all. John Carpenter brings to life a nail-biting nightmare on Halloween night, when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut, career defining role) and her mischievous friends plan a night of sneaky fun- only to cross paths with a relentless psychopath from hell. Michael Myers has escaped from a nearby insane aslyum...having slaughtered his sister fifteen years earlier, he is now back in Haddonfield, the sleepy Illinois town where his murder took place. Once he sets his eyes on Laurie after she drops off a package to the abandoned house where he lived, he begins to stalk and terrorize her, turning her night of fun into terror as he picks off anyone in his path to get to her.Beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flick scary... with the long gloomy shots it constantly feels as if you're being stalked by the maniacal serial killer himself. Myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion.Although 'Halloween' is certainly outdated, it is by no means less chilling. The idea alone is goose bump inducing, and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made to this day... it spawned seven sequels and eventually Rob Zombie's equally scary remake, and it set a new standard for horror that still exists today.",8,1,2,10 January 2008
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Nightmare to Remember
","Everybody knows Freddy Kreuger, the hideously burnt serial killer with knives attached to his fingers. He is a horror icon, ranking with Leatherface, Michael Myers, Jason, Michael Jackson, and all the rest of the famous bad guys. Whether you've seen this horror gem or not.I didn't give 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' a fair chance the first time I saw it, and I generally disregarded it and didn't think much on it. But a while later something told me to watch it again and it immediately appealed to me all of a sudden. I was creeped out and there was a great, descriptive story, something missing from most modern slashers. Krueger is genuinely scary and the plot aids that scariness tremendously. Murdered by a mob of angry parents, Krueger was a former child serial killer. Now, the descendant children of the parents on Elm Street are being stalked by Freddy in their dreams, where he can physically kill them in a dark boiler room. Very dark stuff, but with its thick layer of black humor and comic moments, it never truly achieves serious, tense scares, for when they're coming, director Wes Craven throws some silliness into the pot.You'll laugh and jump, and you'll remember Freddy forever. This is an instant classic, made back in the eighties by an ambitious and eager director Wes Craven, who went on to be particularly famous for the 'Scream' trilogy. Robert England is perfect as Freddy and he would go on to play the maniacal dream demon in I believe six sequels, only a few of which were decent but none of which actually live up to the suspenseful first.Freddy's coming for you. *** out of ****",8,0,0,13 December 2007
A Walk to Remember," Mandy Moore is Sweet
","Basically the only reason people saw this was to see Mandy Moore in her debut performance. The popular teen pop star was put to the test to provide a decent performance in a romance movie loosely based on the bestseller by Nicholas Sparks (it's a great book, highly recommended). And to everyone's surprise, she's actually quite good. A lot better than most modern teen actresses in fact. The movie is a bit overly saccharine with it's teeny bopper appeal, but the romance that blossoms between her character Jamie and the bad boy at school Landon (a touching performance by Shane West) is believable and heartbreaking. Of course there's a catch. Even though everything seems to be great because a barrier between popular and unpopular is broken with their love, it turns out that Jamie only has a short amount of time to live- she's dying of Leukemia. The movie becomes unbearably sad but Moore and West carry it perfectly, with heartfelt performances in a truly convincing manner. I guarantee you'll cry by the end of this, and if you don't you'll at least appreciate the sweetness and purpose of the film.",7,1,3,19 March 2008
Jurassic Park," The Scariest and most Thrilling in the Series
","Steven Spielberg crafts one hell of a thrilling adventure with 'Jurassic Park', his revolutionary blockbuster which is one of his best known films.When billionaire John Hammond is threatened to have his secret project shut down, he coaxes a group of scientists to experience the wonders of his them park 'Jurassic Park'. With a team of brilliant geneticists, Hammond has cloned ancient dinosaur DNA and created living, breathing spectacular animals that amaze his guests. Although, as one of them points out early in the film, the endeavor can't be successful. During a purposeful power-out, the monsters break loose and begin feeding on the humans.Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum head a great cast in a nightmarish race against time to make it off the island without being devoured by the prehistoric beasts.Spielberg keeps the plot tight and the action sequences are still incredible to this day. The first appearance of the T-Rex is still bone chilling and exciting. This is a master action thriller that shouldn't be missed.",8,0,1,6 March 2008
