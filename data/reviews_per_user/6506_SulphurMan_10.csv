Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Powerhouse. Plain and simple.
","When all is said and done, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is quite simply one of the best Tarantino films out there. You will be hard pressed to find a film that better fuses the mans love for all shades of cinema and yet retains his unique style. Vol. 1 was a great, entertaining slice of film but it really cant stack up to Vol. 2. Here we have all of the things that go into a solid Q.T. picture: Excellent and engaging dialogue, eye poppping (forgive the pun) fight scenes and colorful charecters. Vol. 2 works on every level and watching it felt more relaxed and enjoyable than the first one. I think the key to Vol. 2 is to just chill out and watch what is given. RELAX, sit back and recieve it all. Thats how a good Tarantino film should work and boy does this deliver.",Null,1,3,22 April 2004
Requiem for a Dream," A truly powerful, gripping film. Exceptional.
","Blown away. A modern masterpiece. Its going to be difficult for me to convey my thoughts about this film adequately, considering that it struck so deep but Ill give it an effort.Requiem for a Dream is a film that I think the theatre going public needs to see more of. As difficult as it is to stomach, the subject matter presented here is done with nothing short of pure genius. The themes are treated with a realism that avoids all of the predictable cliches that could surround a 'drug related' film. Fine tuned, ambitious shooting/editing/crafting techniques. Flawless, outstanding performances. A minimal yet interesting and engaging script. This film embodies the spirit of superb film making and then takes it to the next level. I see this as Aronofsky's excellent next step after PI, another engrossing film, but nowhere near as effecting and devastating as this. It should be noted that this is not an easy film to watch. The climax in this movie is difficult and painful, even though you could see it coming a mile away. There is no light at the end of the tunnel, no silver lining, just pure tragedy. Sometimes I think that this sort ofdepraved, depressing atmosphere has its place, and Requiem for a Dream illustrates this belief perfectly. We are left with a tragedy, a real true sense of loss. And yet, we havent been brought to this point by manipulative, morally obsessed tactics - the kind of thing that would surround something like reefer madness or any piece of film propoganda. We have been brought to the tragic climax/'message' of this film through Aronofsky's brilliant approach to film and the capabilities it posseses as communicator and artistic medium. He lets his bold, ambitious style speak for itself, and in the end we are allowed to formulate our own opinions based around the images presented to us. More often than not, those opinions will be ones of sadness and pain. Why did this film strike so deep? I think that Requiem emobodies and illustrates the universal human desire for HOPE by showing us none of it whatsoever. It is concerned with the flip side of hope, the yin of the yang, the lack of it in any capacity. All we can think upon at the end of this film is the absence of hope, and that in itself is enough to instill a strong sense of it within us as viewers. **** out of ****",Null,0,1,6 January 2004
Lost in Translation," aspiring actors and directors: pay close attention to this gem
","Seeing Lost In Translation for a second time really sealed this as the best film I will end up seeing this year. From top to bottom it is a powerhouse of quality acting, excellent writing and premiere directing. Sofia Coppola has a rich future ahead if she can keep cranking out films with this level of class.The special effects, provacotive sexuality and spooon fed ideals that plague most films and keep viewers attached to the frequent outpouring of Hollywood sludge are not neccesary in a film like this. Coppola captures a world that is genuine and strikingly realistic. You often forget that you are watching a movie, let alone watching actors 'act'. Murray delivers perhaps the best performance I have seen in over 3-4 years as a troubled, confused and yet somewhat placid mid life movie star who comes across the young and also somewhat alienated Charlotte, portrayed with amazing conviction by Scarlett Johannsen. Murray's 'Bob Harris' is what acting is all about. His work in this film is exactly what one wants from a standout performance - integrity, honesty and a bit of real conviction. Always staying true to the character he is portraying, Murray delivers the highlight of his career here. An Oscar should be waiting for him....Coppola creates and displays these charecters - warts and all - with a rich attention to backdrop and detail. Her depiction of Tokyo could pass for a visual guidebok. Sounds, images, shapes, people...there is a level of visual examination here that most filmmakers have to skewer and manipulate in order to transport the viewer to their desired point of persepctive. Here, Coppola only needs to show Tokyo as it is to create an atmosphere that her charecters can experience and utilize.I cant tell you how nice it was to buy a movie ticket, sit down in my seat, and watch a film that was so real, so honest and so genuine. I am so tired of watching movies that get by only because of their shock value, or their special effects, or their attractive A list cast. Films like this make the aforementioned efforts looks kind of silly, and I must admit, that fact brought a smile to my face - one that hasnt been there in awhile.
Lost In Translation will age like wine, and with the years this could be viewed as a seminal film in our new century of filmmaking.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A huge and jolting dissapointment
","I am a huge fan of both the original Tolkien LOTR trilogy and the first film, the fellowship of the ring. Both possesed a certain intimacy and overall sense of strength due to the way in which they were original and engaging. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the Two Towers. TTT was a total and complete mess from top to bottom, a downward spiral of pathetic Hollywood money making schemes and an overall heap of cliche garbage.
Characters are as deep as a puddle at this point, and the sole desire of the movie seemed to be geared towards 'awe inspiring' battle scenes,'scary' orcs and the sappy, melodramatic 'bravery' of the heroes. Well, awe inspiring they were not. Predictable and bland is more like it. Gollum was the only shining light in this film, otherwise it was just a total piece of trash. It hurts me to say that, because I enjoyed the first film so much and the books are just absolutely phenomenal. I think P. Jackson must have polled a group of 11 year old boys on the way out of the Fellowship of the Ring last year and decided the go on their advice. They probably said stuff like 'The dwarf gimli was so funny! heehee!', 'the battle scenes were really awesome - wow!!!', 'the Uruk Hai leader was scary! - eeek!!!' etc etc etc. After tabulating this information, it seems like he based the movie around these weak sets of standards and made it a long boring waste of time and money.Many crazed and obsessed fans of this film have been defeated by the hype. I think they have been convincing themselves for the last year that since the first one was good, this one will be even better. When they were presented with this melodramatic b.s., somehow I feel like many of them just accepted it because they didnt want to be let down. Thats a real shame. I say embrace the dissapointing feeling and just be honest, rather than trying to convince yourself that it was the incredible triumph you think it was. Hey - if you liked it, you liked it. Im not going to argue with that. It just seems really pitiful when someone claims they dont like TTT and get ripped apart for speaking their opinion. Thats just depressing. I think many fans are unfortunately starting to equate the books with these movies, and claming that a true fan of the books MUST love TTT or else theyre not a real fan. Thats just sad, I think. will probably bring up the boneheaded argument 'well why did you post this much if you hated it so much!?!?!'. Im posting this in hope that maybe somehow, someway, anyone else out there who loved the books and was dissapointed with this movie can honestly feel like they arent the only one who is honest with themselves. A film series of this magnitude also deserves an even headed approach rather than just a bunch of blind Peter Jackson worshippers saying that it is the greatest movie of all time.I would like to see a more charecter based and mature approach to the last film so that it can at least be seen as some sort of overall effort rather than just a good start and nothing more. This needs to improve, its gotten very weak.Can you honestly claim that this film deserves a 9.0?????????",Null,0,0,3 January 2003
Mulholland Drive," Outstanding - a Lynch Tour De Force!
","Enough praise cannot be said about this film. Totally and utterly astonishing work form Lynch and definately one of his best works to date. I wouldnt even know where to start, so I wont, Ill just say that this one really delivers. When the end credits started to roll, I smoked a cigarette, gathered my thoughts, and immediately watched it all over again. Its rare that a film can be so engaging anymore. A job well done Mr. Lynch!",Null,1,2,18 September 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Electrifying 'Kill Bill' operates under its own (excellent) terms
","Quentin Tarantino's boldly proclaimed 4th film 'Kill Bill: Episode 1' is a film that succedes on more levels than there are kung fu fighters in its majestic climax. It conquers its violent and surprisingly vacant subject matter with consistent doses of visual and sensory flourishes that co-exist seamlessly in a world where Mr. Tarantino has free reign over his ideas, and uses them to their most extreme and rewarding conclusions. Its violent, its mindless and you guessed it - its pure cinematic entertainment on a grade A level.Before we go any further, lets jot it down for both good measure and vital importance: Quentin Tarantino has obviously got a thing for the world of motion pictures. Asian Kung-Fu flicks, Spaghetti Westerns and the gritty world of exploitation filmmaking are appropriate influences here, whilst big budget, objectively based, heart warming (and arguably maniuplative) epics are out. Unless youve lived under a *mutliplex* rock, you are probably familiar with his past features, films that focus on pulpy crime subject matter in a world of amoral, colofrul charecters who are no more than fanatsized creatures in the eternal planet of 'cool'. Kill Bill ambitiously takes this genre of filmmaking into the next era with a sense of reckless ambition and skill that pulsates each frame along at lightning fast rates, taking the viewer out for an experience once known as a night at the movies. Its important to note that rather than just recycling the similar dialogue based aspects that guided past efforts such as 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and the overlooked 'Jackie Brown', Tarantino gives us a breather and brings us along for a trip into wall-to-wall action territory. 'Kill Bill' marvelously does for action what 'Pulp Fiction' did for dialogue: It re-invents the genre by giving it new life steeped in both classic film history and equally fierce independant ambition. Its definately a Tarantino type of film that doesnt scream the name like a broken record over and over again. Spielberg's and Scorcese's everywhere, take note.
The plot of Kill Bill is...is...oh right, something about a bride who was left for dead, suddenly awakes and is out for vengeance, samurai style. The timeless yet firmly fixed and idealogically bankrupt plot structure provides the appropriate springboard for a trip into the previously mentioned genres of grindhouse filmmaking. Bringing an elemental yet still dignified approach to the main charecter (who's name is curiously bleeped out on screen) is Uma Thurman, the gen X femme fatale from 1994's massive Pulp Fiction. We get all the melodramatic conviction and endless energy of an actress taking a break from the cookie cutter assortment of predictable Hollywood roles set out for her and diving into a role with the possibility to really kick some butt. I knew this film was working when the supporting cast featured a refreshingly nice performance from Lucy Liu as O-Ren Oshi, a member of the DIVAS ensemble that takes top billing on a 'To Kill List' devised by our heroine. The scenes involving her personal militia, herself and the bride will stand as some of Tarantino's best work for years to come. The cinematogrpahy, editing, charecter interaction, pacing, and the excellent soundtrack resound with a strong sense of achievement and purpose here, and you cant help but realize that youre sitting dangerously close to the edge of your seat for most of it. Besides, how many times can you REALLY say that you sat on the edge of your seat throughout your film going history? Im not talking about anticipating the films end either, Im talking about being stimulated on a visual level that seems completely assumed and natural. The kind that seem to have substance even if the plot isnt crying out for it with zealous self-righteous appeals. Its nice to experience this universe sometimes as opposed to the heavy, chin wagging, mind twitching CGI universe that landed a couple years ago.If you are like this reviewer and youre not all that familiar with the film influences or genres being cited here, fear not and be thankful that you got an $8 crash cource in them rather than a late-fee ridden, year long excursion into your local blockbuster. Besides, sometimes its more enjoyable watching a skilled director distill these things for you than rummaging through the waste bin of important cinema. Its rare that Ill take style over substance, but in this case Im not going to deny it. Rather, I'll just sit back with the popcorn and gawk away at a film that knows how to achieve exactly what it sets out to mainly because it sets standards for itself that are precise and cliche, yet somehow fresh and entertaining. 'Kill Bill Volume 1' works if you let it. This is a great film.**** out of ****Philip Jamieson, 2003 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino Starring: Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Vivica Fox and Daryl Hannah
set forth for an amitious film of this magnitude is what really captivates the viewer, and make no mistake about it - 'Kill Bill' actually is the first tour de force of our short century.",Null,0,0,13 October 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A complete film from top to bottom
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of those rare films that features every element of the filmmaking process in communal triumphant majesty. There isnt a single thing missing from this production. When all is said and done Im going to have a tough time finding a more enjoyable film than this in the coming season.A good film must be based on a solid screenplay, and since this is Kaufman's best one to date, we are already off to a great start. Everything about this offering from him is focused, engaging and interesting. Perhaps its because he is now a seasoned veteran, or maybe its because the themes here are more personal and sentimental than his last few scripts, but whatever it is, he just totally dominates the craft of creating a screenplay here. True to form, he avoids all of the cheap, cliche sentimentality of Hollywood films and forces the audience member to interact with the subject matter and engage their mind in order to get anything out of the film - something that turns out to be a far more rewarding payoff than the standard silver platter method of emotional delivery that is plaguing most movies lately. I respect this dimension of his work and acknowledge that somehow he takes his skills to the next level with this one.Throw in Gondry's excellent and inventive direction to the mix and the film is heading higher. His chamera techniques and use of light, movement and space is impeccable and he captures the essence of the emotions in a beautiful, unique way. I tip my hat to his directing, realizing that the subject matter called for something over the top and skilled. Thanks to Gondry's fine work, the words and ideas are given life through his phenomenal directing.All you need is some top notch performances, and boy does this movie deliver here. Jim Carrey seems (oddly enough) made for this role, and his dramatic performance here exceeds any of his comdeic roles comparatively. He seems comfortable with his character, and his understated approach here gives his charecter form and shape. I knew Carrey could act decently if given the right material, but this really was a revelation I think. This performance should be his career defining role. With Kate Winslet its basically the same story - powerhouse acting on a higher level than we are used to lately. Too bad the academy will bypass these performances come oscar time for the conventional, cookie cutter teary routine from denzel washington or whoever else. These performances are the kind that deserve serious recognition.",Null,0,1,22 March 2004
The Red Violin," Shocked
",I wasnt expecting a film of this caliber. This will always stand out as one of the seminal motion pictures in my viewing career simply for its remarkable pacing and lovely premise. The plot line is very engaging and very clever. I enjoyed Sam Jacksons work in this the most I think. He just dominates the screen with a certain prowess that infers mental clarity. The scene in which he hears the violin played for the first time and tears build behind his eyes is just simply incredible. Ive never seen anything like it. I dont know how its possible to not be won over by this film. Its exceptional.,Null,0,0,16 July 2002
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction. It is the REAL DEAL.
","Ill go on record and claim that Pulp Fiction is probably the best motion picture Ive ever seen. After you have seen Pulp Fiction, things are just different, whether you like it or not. Other films seem empty, boring, un-creative, formulaic, and bland compared to this monster. What happened with Pulp Fiction is more or less a pop culture phenomenon. This film single-handedly set the blueprint for every other film that followed it. Everything from high budget epics to teen romances draw on aspects of this flick. Some incredible things came with Pulp Fiction, and almost 10 years later it is still sending tremors throughout the motion picture industry. Compelling and comedic dialogue, brilliant editing, top notch acting, bravado directing - this film encapsulates everything good, fun and clever about the filmmaking process and audience interaction with a film. Tarantino gets career high performances from John Travolta, Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman. You put these people under any other director and look what happens...not a whole lot. What happened with this movie was nothing short of pure genius on all counts. What you get here is a collection of entertainment, shock and disbelief. All of these things swarm into your mind as you watch this, and surrendering to them is enjoyable. How many movies could you just listen to? Ive had this movie on in another room as I did other things, and it was still pretty entertaining. The dialogue is obviously what sent this movie over the top, and with good reason - it is quite simply incredible. Its hard to summarize my thoughts coherantly on this one...It is THAT good. If you havent seen this, rent it, watch it and enjoy it. Its one hell of a ride.***** out of ******",Null,4,8,30 September 2003
Jackie Brown," this one merits another viewing...
","Jackie Brown deserves more credit than it often gets...If anything, it proves that Tarantino has a real knack for filmmaking, and that he isnt some indie fluke who made a couple masterpieces and then went downhill. What weve got here is a real piece of work. A film that is provacotive and entertaining, a film that features solid performances and skilled directing. Jackie Brown embodies the essence of a great film, and I will still stand by the claim I made when I first say the picture: If this came out before Pulp Fiction, in 1994, JACKIE would be viewed as Quentin's masterpiece.But of course as we all know, it followed in the wake of the Pulp madness, and that was perhaps the films death knell. To out-do Pulp would be impossible - it is the greatest film ever made, but I dont think Tarantino was trying to make a film that out did it, I think he was trying to make a film that he would enjoy if he happened to catch it at the cinema back in the 70's. Its fun and it moves at a more methodical pace than its two predecessors (Pulp and Reservoir Dogs), but dont be fooled, its still chock full of brilliant dialogue and inspired segments. Keaton turns in a great performance here, and it just goes to show that he is incredibly underrated. Robert Forster brings a dose of charming reality to the film and he brings a warm and comfortable presence to his charecter. Pam Grier approaches her role as Jackie with the same detached yet confident 'cool' that made her a legend in stuff like 'Coffy'. She's great, and she really keeps you glued to her every move. DeNiro is DeNiro - he is a classic actor and this shows why. He can do it all. Honestly I this is his best work since Raging Bull.Jackie Brown is great, dont be told otherwise. Its an excellent contribution to the film world and should be viewed with a little more distance from the Pulp Fiction madness.",Null,2,3,9 October 2003
