Walk the Line," Oscar bound!
","Phoenix and Witherspoon should most definitely garner Oscar nominations for 2 of the best performances of 2005. In fact, they both deserve to win the acting awards. Please keep in mind that they both do all of their own singing in the film. They did not copy their characters - but made the characters their own. Phoenix proved that he is definitely one of the best young actors presently in movies. Witherspoon has always been a delight - but has now shown why she will have a long movie career. Bravo to the producers of one of the year's best films. Let us hope that the Academy voters reward this film with multiple nominations - Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay and many more - all very much deserved!",10,0,1,20 December 2005
