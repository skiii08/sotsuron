Begin Again," I watched it again recently and I still feel the same.
","Music changes life ... ordinary and warm stories, I like the ending very much, because the male and female protagonists love each other because of music, there is no stereotype, but they return to their own trajectories and continue to move forward. I feel that Keira Knightley is particularly suitable for this role. She also wears beautiful clothes, and she is particularly attractive every time she smiles. I especially like her taste of acting, 'Pride and Prejudice' will always be my favorite movie to watch her movies. I like the character of the heroine of this movie too! Even if the scumbag comes back, it is over, and the communication with Dan is only this step. Dan actually played the Hulk! I have never found it before! He plays such a nervous uncle! The songs in it are also a must listen to my music library before! Sure enough, there is still a dream, and the process of realizing the dream is really happy!",9,0,0,18 March 2020
Suicide Squad," The best characters in this movie are the clown girl and the clown.

Mr. Nobody," This is a thought-provoking film.
","At first, Mr. Nobody thought it was a stream of consciousness. Later, I found out that the film tells that each person's choice brings a different life. Under different lives, the final outcome is still death. Do you still exist at this time? Are you sure that your life is not the imagination of a 9-year-old child? People in reality do not have the same fate as Nemo. If you ca n't choose, if you choose 'no change', you will be lost in the confused forest. Is this a good choice? After 2049, the universe began to fall, and time began to flow backwards. Nemo is the one who happened to have not forgotten. Behind these choices, these butterfly effects seem to exist and disappear.",8,1,2,21 March 2020

August Rush," This is a warm and romantic story.
","I've always loved this movie. It's romantic and moving. The hero and heroine gave birth to Freddy after a one-night stand, and because they are too young, many things can't stand it. Freddy, on the other hand, has a great talent for music, and through music he stands on a big stage. Through music, the reunion of their family of three is more cherished.

The Reader," Hannah's inferiority is the lack of self-confidence in the lack of knowledge, the pursuit of freedom and dignity, Misha's inferiority is the inexplicable love for women in the
","This film is too rough, and it mostly describes the taboo relationship between Mi Xia and Hannah. Hannah's feelings for 15-year-old Mi Xia are rough when she wears stockings in the room. It was wonderful to meet Hannah in the university to review the behavior of WWII in court, especially when she asked the judge 'what would you do?' Because Hannah was illiterate, so she couldn't do the advanced work. She did not understand the crime in the concentration camp. She just felt that at that time she was responsible for her work. After she was imprisoned, Hannah learned the text because of Micha 's audio cassette. . I like Mia to visit Hannah when she goes to prison. Hanna is old and weak and talks with Mia. Her eyes are sad and sad. Kate performed really well.",7,0,0,17 March 2020
