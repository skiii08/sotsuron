Vertigo," Hitch's masterpiece!
","Although Psycho is perhaps Hitchcock's most notorious film, I don't think there's any question that Vertigo is Hitchcock's masterpiece.  This is a haunting, intensely moving, and tragic film.Where to begin?  This is the story of a man names Scottie Ferguson, a former detective who has recently retired from the force after his acrophobia inadvertently caused the death of a man.  Scottie is recruited  by his old friend  Gavin Elster to go back on the job and follow his wife.  It seems that Gavin's wife Madeleine has become possessed by the spirit of a deceased ancestor.  Or is she?  As we are about to learn, nothing is quite as it seems at first.It is fascinating to look at the multiple ways this film can be viewed.  It can be seen as a story about a man who is attracted to a dead woman, a cynical look at how men exploit women, or a study in male impotence.  Pay special attention to the story that the man in the book shop tells Scottie about Carlotta Valdes.  It is important in pointing out the parallels Carlotta's story has to the events that are about to transpire.  Watch the scene where Scottie and Madeleine visit a tree stump in the forest.  It is interesting to see how the characters end up repeating all their actions, visiting the same places, and making the same mistakes as if they were caught up in a whirlpool (hence the symbolism in the opening credits). 
The back story about the making of this film is interesting as well. Hitchcock was infatuated with actress Grace Kelly and would remake many other actresses in her image.  Hitchcock was disappointed when Vera Miles got pregnant and was unable to star in Vertigo.  Fortunately, Hitchcock did a very good job remaking Kim Novak in Vera Miles' image.  No wonder this is considered to be Hithcock's most personal film.Hitchcock directs this film in glowing colour creating a dreamlike atmosphere and Bernard Hermann created one of his all-time greatest music score's to accompany us through this film.  It is worth buying on CD to play all on its own.",Null,3,5,28 April 2002
Unbreakable," A true original, criminally underrated
","I was really disappointed in the negative and/or lukewarm reviews when this film first came out.  'Unbreakable' is every bit as good if not better than 'The Sixth Sense'.  But while the Sixth Sense was an excellent updating of ghost stories, Unbreakable is a true original.  It is a super hero tale set in the real world.Perhaps the subject matter is what turned some critics off.  Yet director Shyamalan treats his film with utmost intelligence and seriousness. In fact this is really an intimate character drama about two people who are, for one reason or another depressed and dissatisfied with their lives, and how their paths interlock.Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance as a security guard who feels unhappy with his job (I would too if I were a security guard).  Samuel L. Jackson is also excellent as the crippled and slightly nutty comic book collector who believes that superheroes really do walk the earth.See it!",Null,1,2,17 March 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Puts the sci in sci-fi
","2001: A Space Odyssey is arguably the greatest science fiction movie ever made.  The reason I regard it as such is the fact that unlike so many other movies of the genre, this really has SCIENCE in it.  It's incredible how many sci-fi movies have no science in them at all.Observe the scenes on board the space station and the spacecraft Discovery. Most science fiction films don't explain how it is that there is gravity on spaceships and stations rather than weightlessness. This film shows how a makeshift gravity is produced by rotating the spacecraft to produce inertia around the inside of the ship.  Who will ever forget that scene where Frank Poole is shown running around Discovery like a rodent?  Observe those scenes where David Bowman and Frank Poole go outside in their spacesuits and spacepods to make reparations.  In other space films there would be fancy sound effects and their jobs would have been completed quickly.  In 2001, these scenes are done in complete silence and the jobs are completed in real time.  This may make it seem less riveting than Star Wars, but you find yourself thinking; this is how it would actually be in real life.Never has space been captured looking so large, cold, bleak, yet beautiful. In a Star Trek film, if you wanted to go some place you would just go into warp 4.  Not so in this film.  In 2001, it takes months for the Discovery to get to Jupiter and during that time the ship just seems to hang in mid air motionless.  Kubrick really makes you feel the distances between planets.For those viewers intending to watch 2001, I recommend only seeing it letterboxed.  For best viewing, see it on the biggest screen possible preferably with the sound connected to the stereo and the lights dimmed. This is truly one of those films which you must allow to take you in as in the theaters.",Null,0,1,1 April 2002
The Sixth Sense," A film about alienation
","Though marketed as a horror film, this is really a moving drama about alienation.  The boy is a disturbed child who's unnatural abilities have caused him to be ostrasized by his peers.  The child psychiatrist is also disturbed; a confrontation with a former patient of his has left him feeling guilty and has put his marriage on the rocks.  Both characters will seek redemption through each other.I responded very strongly to this film.  Anyone who has ever felt alienated from society will identify with Cole Sear and Malcom Crowe as I did. Director Shyamalan creates a creepy and melancholy atmosphere and sustains it for the whole of the film.A word about the famous 'twist' ending.  It would urge people not to give it away in their comments even after inserting a SPOILERS warning.  The film is highly dependent on viewers not knowing the ending.  I saw this film on the first weekend that it was released when I didn't even know there was going to be a twist ending.  I was completely blown away by it and felt a chill going across my body that lasted several days.Also worth seeing; Shyamalan's underrated followup Unbreakable.",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
