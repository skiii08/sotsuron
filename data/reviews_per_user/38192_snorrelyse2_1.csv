Requiem for a Dream," Narrowminded?
","It seems many who have commented on this movie only see it as an anti-drug flic... Many seem to believe it is only about the horrors of addiction.I believe it grasps a larger subjectline than that. To me it is about loneliness, losing the ones you love, seeking refuge whereever you can(i.e. the drugs) and generally how easily life can turn out in ways you never wanted or imagined. The message of Requiem is about more than drug abuse, it is about losing sight of what's really important and about the coldness of society and the fellowman. The title really tells all. This movie is a deathmass for someone's dreams and their lives, but also for society.",Null,0,0,25 January 2003
