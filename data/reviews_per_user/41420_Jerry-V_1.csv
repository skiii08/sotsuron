Resident Evil: Afterlife," When I'd have to pay attention?
","If you are a fan of Resident Evil video game series, or even played one, DO NOT WATCH THIS! Seriously! Everything I've ever loved in the games this movie ruined them all. Character personalities are nothing like original; Chris is cold and vapid, Claire is.. I can't even remember what she did in this movie. Wesker, this bad-ass of games, was so plain boring douche-bag. And oh yes there was Jill, that's all I can say about her.What comes to a plot? There were things happening and more things happening. I didn't really catch what was going on most of the time and when I'd have to pay attention. It doesn't make a good movie combining cool things with cool things with no sense in it.Acting wasn't good, at all. It was cheap and amateur-like.How you didn't see those 3-5 parasite-zombie-things next to you at the large empty hall?But there is ONE thing I liked: It did look good. Milieu was game-like, mainly colored gray with good ambiance.Most of the stunts and CGI's were more or less plagiarized from Matrix, or so it seems. There were also few lazy texture flaws (especially at the fight with the Executioner) that I saw at the first time I watched that.I can't do this anymore, hurts too much. -J-PS. What was that with all those torches around? Just for the prop I'd say.",2,0,3,31 January 2011
