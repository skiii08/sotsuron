The Hangover," Las Vegas here we come!
","This movie gets funnier as the story unfolds. I haven't seen a movie as funny as this in too many years! 3 friends and the weird brother of the bride go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. When they wake up from a wild night on the strip, there is a baby and a tiger in their spectacular suite at Cesaer's Palace. Phil has a hospital name band on, Stu, the dentist, has lost a tooth and a valuable heirloom, Alan has lost his underwear (if that is what you call what he wears under his pants) and they have all lost the groom, Doug. The escapades to find Doug are over the top hilarious! As they retrace their steps through events and people, they find out happened and it just gets funnier. The ending credits are a must watch too! From start to finish, there is never a non-laugh moment... a pee-in-your-pants movie. A MUST SEE movie!",10,10,18,17 June 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," A Grimms Brothers Fairytale, India style
","I just loved every aspect of this movie, the actors, including the children were excellent, the cinematography was superb and the story was dark like a Grimm Brothers fairytale, instead of in Bavaria, set in the slums of Mumbai. Jamal gets a spot on 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.' There are lots of questions, 1st is how can someone with such little education from the slums of Mumbai even answer 1 question on this game show, let alone ALL! For me the question is how does a child of the slums know enough written and spoken English to answer these questions? The 1st question is answered as the movie progresses. Each question is a flash-back into his childhood where he is able to find the 'Millionaire' answer as the host of the show mocks him. The 2nd question has yet to be answered, or thought about? Be it as it may, there is a 'witch' that gathers up hungry stray children unknowingly and brings them to a dark forest far away and feeds them well. The brothers are able to figure this captivity as dangerous and escape and the story goes on from there, continuing to meet the challenges of survival. The 'witch' too continues to haunt them (at least Jamal is able to keep at arms length away, his brother not so) and Jamal ends up on 'Millionaire.' This movie deserved every award they received. It is wonderfully told. You get sucked into the story at 1st scene and are glued until the end. What I learned is if you are ever at the Taj Mahal, mind your shoes! A must see movie!",9,0,2,21 March 2009
