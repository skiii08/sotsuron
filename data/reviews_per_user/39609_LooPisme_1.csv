The Incredible Hulk," 'This' is the best Marvel movie
","I'm a fan of comics, especially Marvel's. So it's normal for me to watch Marvel comics' movie adaptations. I watched all of em ,except Fantastic 4 movies,and I can clearly say that, Incredible Hulk is the best of all.I was shocked when I heard that Edward Norton was going to be Banner. I knew that Norton is a good actor, but he was too good to act Banner. You know, in Fight Club, in American History X, he was amazing. Hulk would be an simple action film. Why would he was chosen? Well, this is the point where I'm totally wrong.Edward Norton isn't just the actor, also the writer. You see that difference in every moment, you are not watching a decent action film. You really watch Banner on screen, not someone-who-supposed-to-be-Banner. He really fit himself on the Banner.If you are not decided to see that movie, just do it. If you like marvel stuff you will love it.And a last point. The jokes in movie are just awesome!",9,3,10,14 June 2008
