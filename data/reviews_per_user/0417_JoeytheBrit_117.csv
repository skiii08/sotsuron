"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Fairly decent time-filler, but little more
","For someone who felt let down by the overlong mess that Hot Fuzz turned out to be, I didn't hold out much hope for another Simon Pegg comedy that, on paper at least, looks as if it is merely reheating a load of tired old comedy clichés that we've all seen countless times before. Well, while this film is just a rehash of old plots, it does have a sweet nature at its core that just about makes it worth watching.Pegg plays Dennis, a thirty-something everyman-cum-loser whose only exercise in recent times was a sprint away from his pregnant bride (Thandie Newton) on their wedding day five years earlier. When we meet him in the present day, Dennis is a chain-smoking security guard living alone in a tiny flat, still ruing the mistake he made, and half-heartedly attempting to get back in his ex-'s good books. When he discovers she has embarked on a relationship with super-smooth US businessman Whit (Hank Azaria), Dennis determines to run a marathon to prove he can both change as a person and finish what he has started.What doesn't look too promising on paper is saved largely by a likable cast and a relatively high gag-quotient which stops the viewer from getting bored, even though you can see many of the gags coming a mile off. Pegg and co-writer Michael Ian Black hammer the running metaphor into the ground until even the dimmest of us understand the movie's 'message' and, like those runners portrayed on the screen, the film is ushered along a pre-determined route that precludes any possibility of unexpected twists or turns. Stand-up comic Dylan Moran gets most of the best lines as Dennis's gambling-addict best friend, and could conceivably have been a better choice for the central role.",Null,2,5,18 March 2008
The King's Speech," Not quite as buh-bare-bare-brilliant as they'd have you believe...
","Apart from a couple of expletive-filled outbursts from Prince Bertie (Colin Firth) as he undergoes radical speech therapy under the unorthodox Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), The King's Speech is rather an old-fashioned film which is quite in keeping with the era in which the action takes place. Both Firth and Rush (and Helena Bonham-Carter as a rather foxy Queen Mum) give immaculate performances, although it was Firth who received most of the kudos thanks to his Best Actor Oscar nod. It must be tough giving a convincing performance as an habitual stammerer – every little twitch and hesitation as Firth's character attempts to unlock the words from his throat has to appear entirely involuntary – and so it's probably fair to say that Firth was completely deserving of his awards. Only a badly miscast Guy Pearce as Bertie's older brother fails really to hit the mark.The story moves at a sedate pace as it chronicles Bertie's growing anxiety as events conspire to propel him ever closer to the British throne and a vital role as the voice of Britain as it enters war with Germany in 1939. Despite this slow pace, you get drawn into his plight so that his final rallying speech to the nation – and never has such a dour, forbidding speech had such a feel-good element to it – comes across as a Rocky-like moment of triumph. Perhaps this incredibly strong climax goes some way to explaining the remarkable media and audience response to the film as, prior to this, although it is clearly well-written, directed and acted, the film fails to stand out as anything out of the ordinary.",Null,0,1,13 July 2011
Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 review
","Echoes of the first film imprint themselves on every scene of Dennis Villeneuve's slow-moving overlong sequel, and as is so often the case, the comparisons they evoke are unflattering. Little of the Noir atmosphere of Ridley Scott's classic remains, replaced instead by glossy images and cinematic post-apocalyptic familiarity. It's ok - and that's why it's a disappointment: it's just ok...",Null,0,0,29 April 2020
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Slick and Glossy...
","Apparently, Robert Redford's depression-era fable is from a Hindu text called Bhagavad Gita. It takes a rare imagination to transplant a story of Ancient Indian warriors to the golf courses of American South, so it's strange that the same imagination can't free itself from the conventions of classical Hollywood plotting. While the film is always entertaining, the story it tells is never less than 100% predictable. This same can be said of many movies, but BAGGER VANCE appears to hold itself out as something different, as if it's going to offer something new and sort-of meaningful when really all it's doing is rehashing the increasingly tired 'sport as a metaphor for life' theme.Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon), once a hotshot teenage golfer, lives in drunken semi-seclusion in his hometown of Savannah after a traumatic experience in the Great War. Junuh is a lost soul, a fact signified by Redford's insistence in obscuring his leading actor's face in shadow for the early scenes. His former girlfriend, Adele Invergordon (the somewhat delicious Charlize Theron) also has troubles: her father committed suicide after the Great Crash wiped out his fortune, leaving her with an expensive white elephant of a golf resort and a mountain of debt. She determines to hold a challenge match between America's two greatest players to raise funds to pay off her debts and, having persuaded/tricked them into taking part in a too-contrived fashion, discovers that the townsfolk won't stand for it unless a local hero also takes part. This is where young Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief), the narrator introduced to us as a dying present-day Jack Lemmon, steps in and suggests Junuh. Naturally Junuh refuses, but then has his mind changed by young Adele stripping to her undies. Trouble is, Junuh has lost his swing, which is where Bagger Vance (Will Smith) makes his entrance, braving the golf balls Junuh is whacking into the night at all angles, and jauntily proclaiming, 'I positioned myself right in front of you, 'cause from the way your swings were going', I figured that was the safest place'. Bagger is a figure of mystery, perhaps guardian angel, perhaps God, literally emerging from the darkness in answer to the apparent cry for help Junuh made when he picked up his golf clubs againThis film is such a slick and glossy example of Hollywood professionalism that at times you find yourself suddenly jettisoned from the story to reflect on how damn slick it all is. The cinematography is at times sublime, offering us rich images of the southern states in the midst of a depression, the worst consequence of which seems to be that young Hardy's father is forced to take a job cleaning the streets. This is the old MGM style of movie-making, a world that bears only a passing resemblance to our own, and in which townsfolk urge a young boy to 'fly with wing-ed sandals on your feet' as the eager mite dashes off to plead with the town drunk to pick up the sticks once more. It's almost endearing in its way, and if it weren't for the aura of falsity that keeps seeping in and out of the proceedings, it might be something worth shouting about.A major problem is the casting. Theron is fine in a role that doesn't call for much more than a spunky female who looks good in vibrant 30s costumes, but Damon and Smith are both miscast. Damon's just about the right age to play Junuh, but his pretty boy features simply don't bear the marks of a decade-plus of alcohol-fuelled trauma. Damon is the type of guy who, when he's fifty is going to look like a 25-year-old with wrinkles; at the age of thirty he looks like a twenty-year-old who hasn't even begun to sample life; he's lost us before he even opens his mouth, which is a shame because he's a good actor who brings a lot to his roles. Nevertheless, Damon could just about squeeze by without requiring too much suspension of belief on the part of the viewer, but Smith simply doesn't have a chance. He's easily about twenty-five years too young for the role, and growing a beard doesn't make that much of a difference. All the time I was watching the film I kept thinking of a mature character actor like Morgan Freeman as more suited to the part, and was surprised to discover that Freeman had been Redford's first choice for the role but that he had decided against him in favour of a younger actor. I can understand Redford choosing to stand down as Junuh, but selecting Smith over Freeman just doesn't make sense  unless you're an accountant. That's not to say Smith doesn't give a good performance, in fact he's very good and, after all the no-brainer blockbusters he's appeared in over the past few years you start feeling optimistic about what might be ahead from him, but no actor, no matter how good, could come out on top when called upon to wrestle with some of the truly laughable lines he delivers that are supposed to be laden with deep mystical meaning.Despite all this, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE kept me interested for the entirety of its long and slowly-paced running time. Redford conjures up some memorable images and manages to revisit themes he has explored a number of times now without the material growing stale. It all harks back to the kind of uplifting fare Hollywood churned out by the truckload back in its Golden Era, which is no bad thing. It's old-fashioned for sure, and shamelessly tries to manipulate the audience at times, but it has such a good-natured heart that, unless you're the deepest of cynics, you'll probably find yourself being drawn in.",Null,3,6,24 August 2005
Vertigo," Hitchcock's Masterpiece
","'Do you believe someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?' This question, posed by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to John 'Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart) as he attempts to hire the former police detective to follow his wife (Kim Novak) ostensibly provides the theme to what is, in my opinion, Hitchcock's masterpiece. On the surface, this entire film resolves around this concept on two levels: the apparent possession of Madeleine Elster by Carlotta Valdez and the desperate attempts of Scottie to resurrect Madeleine by transforming the appearance of Judy Barton. But there is much more going on beneath the surface of this movie, an emotional imbroglio suggested with a range of sublime methods that provides it with its real narrative thrust. Certainly, VERTIGO is a film done an injustice by anyone who only watches it once. It require an indefinite number of viewings to be fully appreciated.It is inarguable that the film's story doesn't pass muster under close inspection, but Hitchcock is such a master at manipulating the audience that this never really bothers us. Dispensing with any in-depth introduction to his characters, he immediately draws us into the events unfolding on the screen, and it is only long after the devastating final image that we are given time to consider the plot in detail, and by then we are so blown away by the pure genius of his exploration of fear and obsession that we are willing to forgive any shortcomings in the plot. Hitchcock was at the height of his powers here, and Stewart's career had already begun to move away from light leading man roles and towards an altogether darker domain  a transition which might not have been so successful had he not had Hitchcock's assured hand to guide him. Novak was never a great actress, but Hitchcock coaxes a career best from her here and she never looked more beautiful that in her incarnation of Madeleine Elster. Hitchcock weaves an air of mystery about her that adds to the unreality of her character, and thus the spellbinding of Scottie, in his fragile mental condition, becomes all the more tragic and poignant. He's falling in love with an illusion, and when that illusion dies he creates another illusion to take its place so that, in reality, he is obsessed with a woman who doesn't exist. There are long stretches without dialogue in this movie that seem to reinforce the impression that it is about images and the way that we interpret them. Colour also plays an important part  red and green especially  and provide complex tableaux filled with metaphor and symbolism.This movie comes as close to perfection as a film produced within the studio system can; every scene is important, and each adds something to the story and to our understanding of the characters. Hitchcock supplies sly clues and symbols in unexpected places and seemingly unimportant moments, and there are certain aspects that will probably continue to confound and intrigue the viewer even after multiple viewings. In short, VERTIGO is a complex and intelligent film created by a craftsman at the height of his powers, and should be seen by anybody possessing even a passing interest in film.",Null,2,5,21 August 2005
The Incredible Hulk," It isn't easy being green...
","Ed Norton may well go down in movie history as the only character to be less handsome than his monstrous alter-ego in this film. A hulk this brute may well be, but he's a rugged, strong-jawed fellow with a sensitive nature lurking just beneath the rippling green muscles...The Incredible Hulk is pretty good as far as Superhero movies go, but I can't help wondering why Norton felt it necessary to apparently change so much of Zak Penn's screenplay given the latter's track record in superhero screen adaptations. Whatever the reason, the first half of the film, in which the story explores the lonely, wretched existence of the fugitive Bruce Banner is quite involving. Unfortunately the film's second half, which concentrates more on the cartoonish elements of the character's adventures, is not quite so engaging and, in the final confrontation, it is numbingly obvious that all we are watching is two cartoons duking it out.The cast here is also pretty good for a superhero flick aimed at the teens, even though Norton, Hurt, Roth, et al, often appear to merely be going through the motions. Nevertheless, if you're in the mood for some undemanding entertainment this will fit the bill nicely.",Null,0,1,29 April 2009
Lucky Number Slevin," Slick and enjoyable, but a little too clever for its own good
","This very slick, fast-moving crime thriller from Paul McGuigan actually has a very simple revenge story at its core, but writer Jason Smilovic seems to have worked hard at making it as convoluted as possible. Like a pair of seasoned hustlers, though, McGuigan distracts us with flashy visuals a la Guy Ritchie while Smilovic keeps us wrong-footed with his dense, fast-talking dialogue that appears to owe more than a little to Tarantino at times.Josh Hartnett is engaging enough as Slevin, an amiable young man who finds himself mistaken by a couple of gangsters (Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley, both good) for his friend Nick Fisher, who just happens to be into Freeman for $96,000. Freeman is willing to settle the debt, however, if Fisher/Slevin is willing to bump off Kingsley. From this simple strand things take off in increasingly convoluted circles as Slevin finds unexpected  and incredibly fortunate, when you think about it  assistance from police coroner Lucy Liu who lives in the flat opposite Fisher. And while all this is going on a melancholic Bruce Willis lurks in the background in one of his sillier wigs.This is one of those roller-coaster rides that barely slows long enough for you to draw breath, so determined is it to keep you guessing throughout its running time. For the most part, it's good  if over-derivative  fun, as long as you don't take it too seriously. But by its last reel it was straining to maintain its credibility as it pulled off its umpteenth twist. In fact, this is one of those films that's so deliberately convoluted that you can't prevent yourself from picking over it afterwards to find out where the inevitable plot holes are. And there are so many of these twists to be straightened out that it takes Smilovic a good fifteen minutes to unravel them all and that has got to be too long because, for my money, the truly clever films are those that, while they may be as convoluted as this, can be explained with a single devastating revelation.",Null,0,1,10 October 2007
The Hangover," Good plotting, but not as funny as the trailer.
","I enjoyed this daft comedy well enough, but it isn't the funniest film to recently come out of Hollywood – in fact it would probably struggle to make it into the top three even though it serves up a regular supply of laughs. I suppose that's the trouble with funny trailers – they tend to be a double-edged sword because they draw the people into the cinema but fail to achieve the level of laughs suggested by the trailer that many might expect. The film follows the misadventures of a group of average guys on the stag night of one of them who goes missing following a night that none of them can remember. The guys wake up in their trashed penthouse villa with monster hangovers and discover a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in a cupboard.I liked the fact that the guys here weren't sex-crazy teens but thirty-somethings with the attendant baggage a few more years under the belt inevitably brings, even though it fails to sidestep some clichéd situations. The film goes out of its way to undermine preconceived notions: the funny cops are also sadistic and vindictive, the outwardly respectable girlfriend is a foul-mouthed harridan who cheats on her partner while the seasoned Vegas stripper/escort is a sweet girl, Mike 'ear-biter' Tyson (who I feel comfortable saying is looking decidedly porky these days, seeing as he is more than an ocean's distance away from me as I type this) is a good guy, the vicious villain is camp and weedy, and so on. It's no doubt a strategy to keep things fresh, and it works for the most part. The four friends make a likable bunch, even as they bicker and fight, and the mystery at the core of the film means that the pace only occasionally flags.",Null,0,2,22 March 2010
Spartacus," Hit and Myth
","Director Stanley Kubrick was brought in late on this sprawling epic, which is probably why it possesses few (if any) of his touches; nevertheless it still qualifies as one of his better movies and as perhaps the best of the epics from the 50s/60s. Kirk Douglas stars as the eponymous hero, a troll-like biter of Roman's ankles when we first meet him, who is transformed into a svelte and charismatic leader of an army of slaves. Needless to say, this being a Hollywood studio movie, the story told here plays pretty fast and loose with the truth. Major characters, such as Verinia and Antoninus are pure invention, and the film has created something of a myth about the real Spartacus who was apparently a Roman deserter who was sold into slavery upon his capture and sent to Batiatus's gladiator training school. Gracchus (a wonderfully written part played with typical skill by Charles Laughton) did exist  but about 50 years before the slaves' uprising. It's a shame that writer Dalton Trumbo and executive producer Douglas felt it necessary to add these invented characters, as they provide the weakest strands of the story. Jean Simmons is miscast in the part of Verinia: she's too demure and fragile-looking, too much the English lady you'd expect to find pouring tea in the garden instead of wine in the atrium. Her part is not particularly well written, either  too passive, even in her scenes with Olivier after the final battle. The character of Antoninus, played with little distinction by a too-old-for-the-part Tony Curtis  whose occasional forays into historical epics were never successful  is superfluous to the plot, and his only function seems to be to provide the writers with a means of demonstrating the sexual mores of Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier  another strong performance), the political foe of Gracchus, who represents the autocratic alternative to Gracchus's democratic ideal. Having abandoned his position as Crassus's body servant, Antoninus joins up with Spartacus and accompanies him to the very end. It's difficult to understand why Trumbo didn't simply merge the characters of Crixus (John Ireland), Spartacus's fellow gladiator and friend, and Antoninus, and find some other way to convey the nature of Crassus's character and ambition for Rome.The political intrigues provide by far the more interesting aspect of the story, and were probably more important to Douglas than the emotional side, which seems to have been incorporated as a sop to the studio's need for a box office return. The intrigue and machinations of Crassus and the wily old senator Gracchus are never less than completely absorbing, whereas the emotional sub-plots rarely rise above the level of some biblical potboiler. For me, Laughton's performance far outshines that of Oscar winner Peter Ustinov (who nevertheless gives a terrific performance as Lentulus Batiatus, the cowardly owner of the gladiator school in which the slaves' revolt is born) and it's a mystery how he never received even a nomination for any major award for the part. Kirk Douglas, resists the temptation to grandstand for the most part in what could so easily have become a showy role, and works hard to show the man behind the myth. Russ Metty's superb cinematography never fails to do justice to the scale and scope of the story, and Alex North's score is justifiably celebrated.While it's not without its shortcomings  not least of which is its protracted running time  SPARTACUS is deserving of the praise it has received over the years, and its reputation will no doubt continue to be enhanced in years to come.",Null,1,4,28 August 2005
Stop-Loss," Read the small print...
","Your natural inclination is to sympathise with Ryan Phillippe's character when he learns on the day he expects to be leaving the military that he is to be drummed back into the middle of the conflict in Iraq instead. As they say, he should have read the small print, but it's easy to believe that the majority of young men who sign up to serve their country fail to give the documents they're signing more than a cursory glance.The film follows a fairly routine path, peopled by predictably 'divergent' characters whose mental scars affect them in different ways but, once it moves beyond the somewhat stomach-churning homecoming parade, manages to keep the viewer's interest. Although Philippe, Gordon-Levitt and Tatum all give decent performances as the messed-up returning heroes it's Gordon-levitt who makes the biggest impression thanks to the more understated manner of his performance. Philippe is miscast but manages the role well.The film is careful not to criticise outright the stop-loss clause that allows the military to send former soldiers back to the battlefield, which means that any message it tries to convey is confused to say the least, a flaw which is then exacerbated by the fact that, late on in the film, it suggests that Philippe's character isn't rebelling against the recall because it is inherently wrong but because he is suffering a crisis of confidence and guilt after leading his men into an ambush on their last mission.",Null,0,0,17 June 2009

","This updated adaptation of Stephen King's bloated horror novel shifts the era to the 1980s and focuses solely on the children's encounter with the malevolent clown, Pennywise.

The Death of Stalin," The Death of Stalin review
","Hugely enjoyable satire that recounts the political intrigue and settling of scores that arose in the wake of the death of Joseph Stalin in 1950s Soviet Russia. The decision to allow actors to use their real accents is a curious one that nevertheless adds to the chaotic, semi-surreal atmosphere. The humour is as black as it comes and relentless, and the entire cast rise to the occasion. Very, very funny at times.",Null,0,0,6 May 2020

Citizen Kane," Sliced Bread
","I came across this old film in the bargain bin at my local pound store and couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it beforeOK, only kidding. Let's face it: you'd have had to have spent your entire life living in a hermetically sealed bubble to not know about Orson Welles' debut film, which is almost universally hailed as the greatest movie of all time. It's an interesting – and divisive – title for any film to be saddled with, that World's Greatest Movie tag. Imagine being branded something as modest as the world's greatest commis chef, or world's greatest dishwasher, and see how quickly people would start trying to bring you down from your lofty perch. There seems to be a lot of people wanting to know what's so great about Kane, mostly because every groundbreaking film-making technique generally – and to a degree, mistakenly – attributed to Kane, now forms the core of every film school's Big Book of Movie-Making, thereby blunting Kane's once industry-changing impact. The film deserves recognition because of its place in history, no doubt about it. But is it any good? Well, yes, actually. Citizen Kane provides the audience with an intelligent, insightful and sophisticated character study of an egotistical megalomaniac and delivers, in almost every shot, something meaningful that contributes to our understanding of Kane. A rich vein of irony runs through the film. For example, the photograph in the opening newsreel of Kane with his son and smiling wife below the newspaper headline announcing his nomination for Senator is taken the moment before his wife reveals to him she knows about his mistress. Kane's political aspirations die within an hour of that jubilant photograph being taken. Welles doesn't bother to point that out, crediting the audience with enough intelligence to not require a guiding hand.I doubt whether any Hollywood film prior to this one had penetrated so deep or so vividly beneath the surface of its character. As the film progresses, Kane's material wealth grows in direct correlation to the loss of his personal relationships, until he is alone in a vast, monolithic castle on a hill. In the first half of the picture the character of Kane is permanently surrounded by others, but as his political aspirations fade and his personal shortcomings come to the fore, his figure either becomes smaller or he occupies the screen alone.Perhaps Welles the actor is one of the film's biggest liabilities: his acting is unconvincing at times. Welles himself felt he tended to over-intellectualise when he acted, and I think he was right. Whatever the reason, he doesn't always inhabit the character the way he should to be totally convincing. Joseph Cotten, one of Welles' Mercury Theatre players also making his debut, gives probably one of the most convincing performances, while Dorothy Comingore as the hapless songbird who becomes Welles' second wife, becomes so shrill towards the end that you begin to wonder why he would want to keep her around.Is it the greatest film ever made? I don't know. A lot of people ridicule the idea, but many of them are of a younger generation, and fail to come up with a realistic alternative. It's pretty good though, I know that, and is easily superior to anything else Hollywood was putting out back then. It makes you wonder how much more Welles might have achieved if Hollywood hadn't been so intimidated by his precocious exuberance.",Null,0,0,30 April 2010

Amistad," An interesting story weakened by over-earnestness
","Amistad is strangely old-fashioned in its simplification of the true story of a group of natives from Sierra Leone who murder their captors aboard the eponymous vessel as they are illegally transported to the States to become slaves. It's more like a Hollywood film from the forties or fifties than the nineties and so, rightly or wrongly, I felt a sense of mistrust about the accuracy of Spielberg's retelling of the events as I watched. This mistrust was deepened by Spielberg's use of an overbearing soundtrack which he seems to use to manipulate his audience rather than to enhance the viewing experience.The scenes aboard the ship are the best, but they account for only a small portion of the running time, and so the excitement and horror of the situation at sea is soon quelled by lengthy sequences of talking heads as they argue about the fate of the Africans. Spielberg captures the flavour of the times well, though, and the members of the large cast are all better than average  especially Djimon Hounsou as the leader of the captives who manages to convey a range of emotions, largely without the luxury of dialogue. Anthony Hopkins also stands out as John Quincy Adams, the crusty former president who eventually comes to the aid of the young lawyer (Matthew McConnaughy) representing the would-be slaves. It's just a shame that Adams' courtroom speech, which apparently persuades a judge selected by the prosecution to find in favour of the defence, is so flat and uninspiring.Upon their victory, we see shots of the slave camp in Sierra Leone being bombed and other captive natives being led to freedom as the over-emotional music swells. Those who have used slaves for centuries (both Brits and Americans), are depicted as valiant heroes here, which is as much of a con as Hounsou and his brethren, who after all murdered almost all the crew of the Amistad, being depicted as noble, thoughtful men whose comparative simplicity compared to their captors somehow elevates them to a higher moral plain.Spielberg's to be applauded for bringing a little-known event in American history to the popular consciousness, but it's just a shame he couldn't have delivered it to us with a little less old-time sentimentality.",Null,0,1,9 April 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," I'll Soon be Forgetting Forgetting Sarah Marshall
","It's no surprise that this film pretty much divides opinion between the young and not-so-young (according to the user ratings) and, to a lesser extent, between women and men. You'd expect it to be a chick flick rom-com (if you forgot that Judd Apatow was involved) but, with its irreverent gross-out comedy and stock of hot females, it's no wonder that it appeals to young men.Jason Segel stars as Peter, a musician who finds himself dumped by his TV star girlfriend. On the advice of his slightly nerdy friend, Peter decides to fly to Hawaii to forget her, but guess what? She's only there! At the same hotel! Who'd have thought it? Unfortunately, she's there with the man she dumped Peter for, a hairy rock star played by the witless Russell Brand. This being a product of La-La land, it's absolutely impossible for either party to consider changing hotels, so the hapless Peter runs into his ex and her new man everywhere he goes. Luckily for him there's a luscious receptionist on hand to help soothe his pain The film's amiable enough, but it struggles to find many laughs in such a clichéd situation. Many scenes and situations seem to have been created for no apparent reason: a sub-plot involving a dorky pair of newlyweds goes nowhere and is abruptly dropped, leaving you to wonder why it was included in the first place; Pete's ex's TV programme is dropped while she's on holiday but, after a brief conversation, is also forgotten. Apparently the story is based on the writer's own break up from an actress, so maybe there's some kind of catharsis going on here, but that doesn't excuse a plot that is more merely a collection of incidents than a properly constructed narrative.Jason Segel makes a likable leading man, although, like most of us, he looks immeasurably better in his clothes than out of them. He just about manages to get the audience on his side, even though his character would no doubt be something of a nightmare to live with and he would be lucky to maintain a meaningful relationship with a woman for five months let alone five years. Kristen Bell as his errant girlfriend looks yummy, but her character is poorly written. Is she a heartless cow, confused, or simply at the end of her tether? Whatever she is, the script treats her with something approaching contempt much of the time. Mila Kunis, as Segel's true love outshines Bell in every department (can she really be the voice of Meg in Family Guy?), but again her character lacks consistency. Russell Brand manages to be marginally less annoying then he normally is, which is probably the biggest compliment he'll ever receive from me.This isn't a great film by any measure, but its popularity will probably prove enduring enough to ensure it's shown every other day on some second-tier satellite channel.",Null,8,13,23 July 2010
Happy Gilmore," Mindless Entertainment
","I suppose in many ways Adam Sandler has something of an advantage over other film comedians because nobody goes into a Sandler movie expecting a bellyful of laughs, so they're not particularly disappointed when they receive exactly what they expect. Perhaps that is why this average comedy – which appears to have been sponsored by Subway – from the so-called funny man enjoys quite a high rating on this site.Sandler plays the title character, an aspiring ice hockey player whose enthusiasm for the sport vastly outweighs his ability. Shortly after failing once again to win a trial with his local ice hockey team he discovers that his Grannie has been evicted from her home for tax evasion and must raise $275,000 if she wants to get it back. Rather fortuitously, Happy accidentally learns that he has a rare talent for golf and determines to win the house back for Grandma.Yeah, doesn't sound too great, does it? And the truth is it isn't a great film, but Sandler keeps the annoyance quotient on low so that his character comes across as quite likable despite some rather obvious anger management issues. Many other reviewers identify the fight that breaks out between Sandler and his celebrity partner as the highlight of the film, but as the guy is unknown in Britain much of the humour from that scene is lost. Fortunately, the rather lovely Julie Bowen is on hand to provide some entertainment for the eyes when the humour levels drop, and Christopher McDonald as Happy's hotshot golfing nemesis puts in an enjoyable performance.I don't think this one will last long in anybody's memory, but it's entertaining enough in a mindless kind of way.",Null,0,2,21 September 2010
Balls of Fury," 'Panda's dead!'
","Yet another in an increasingly long line of minor-interest sports films based on the same formula employed by major-interest sports films but injecting a large dose of juvenile humour. Balls of Fury adapts the plot from Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon to tell its tale of Randy Daytona, one time child table tennis contender who is reduced to using his ping-pong talents on stage in a cheesy cabaret act. As far as this type of film goes, this one isn't as bad as I'd expected. I laughed out loud on a number of occasions, which is fairly unusual - I've noticed that as you grow older you find fewer things funny, especially when it comes to Hollywood's mass-appeal comedy.Lead actor Dan Fogler is a new face to me, and seems in danger of being something of a Jack Black clone. As of yet, though, he's far less annoying than Black, less prone to showboating, and makes quite a likable hero. Christopher Walken plays the villain of the piece, and he's pretty good; he looks like he's having fun playing the part and joins in with gusto with the determinedly childish lunacy of the plot. The film's running time is barely an hour-and-a-half, which is probably just about right; even though things are considerably less funny in the final half-hour, there's still just about enough laughs to keep things going.",Null,1,1,5 May 2008
Oldboy," Angel Wings and Suicides...
","Chan-wook Park's revenge opus certainly starts with a bang as we meet the film's anti-hero Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) holding a man over the edge of a tower block by his tie. What we see  or what we think we see  is misleading, however, and gives us an appropriate introduction to Park's remarkable yet flawed saga. The opening scene echoes a much later, pivotal, moment that holds the key to the entire mystery, and neatly encapsulates one of the themes of OLDBOY  the passing of time, its resonance, the power with which control of another person's time endows us, the manner in which what is a trivial moment in time for one person can be the irreversible beginning of life-altering tragedy for another. OLDBOY is also a study of revenge, of its nature, and of the way vengeance can destroy the person who seeks it more completely than the person on whom it is intended. Immediately after the opening scene Park takes us back fifteen years to meet a much different Oh Dae-su; an overweight drunken buffoon handcuffed to the wall of a police station because of his disruptive behaviour. Bailed out by a friend, Dae-su disappears during the course of a telephone conversation, and awakens to find himself in a prison cell decked out like a cheap hotel room. This room will be his home for a decade-and-a-half during which his only contact with the outside world is via TV. He occupies his time by keeping a journal in which he records all his previous misdeeds and the people with whom he has come into conflict, by toughening his fists against the walls of his cell, and by planning his escape thanks to an additional chopstick delivered with his meal one day. Then, just as he is about to make his escape, Dae-su is releasedBursting from a suitcase as if being reborn into the world, he finds himself on the grassy roof of a tower block that overlooks the street from which he was abducted. On the rooftop is a man contemplating suicide  which is where we came in Dae-Su's ultimate failure to escape from his prison sets a precedent that runs throughout the movie: he fails in everything he sets out to achieve, largely because he is just a puppet  the target of revenge, not its architect.Asian movies are probably the most inventive in the world at present. Unlike Hollywood's Majors, which too often find themselves shackled by their fear of the influence of outspoken pressure groups and moralistic politics, Asian filmmakers are free to explore subjects  and show scenes  from which Hollywood would shrink (which leaves one fearful for the quality of the proposed American remake of this film). This film is typical of that creative freedom. The violence is both cartoonish and sadistic, and is often depicted as of a viscerally epic nature (such as the one-take sequence in the corridor of Oh Dae-su's former prison) or coolly balletic (as in his encounter with a gang of street punks). Park's camera lingers greedily on a close up of a gangster's teeth being extracted with a claw hammer, and we are treated to a scene of Oh Dae-Su tearing the head off a live squid and chewing manfully as its tentacles shiver and curl around his mouth. And yet this violence never seems gratuitous or out of place. While, when looked upon with a studied eye, the corridor fight-scene is more than a little unbelievable, by filming it Park is staying true to the film's Manga roots. Like the stories in those comic books, the characters in OLDBOY seem to operate on the periphery of a world that bears only a passing resemblance to our own. While this makes it easier for us to accept some of the more far-fetched aspects of the plot, it also distances us emotionally from the characters. Characters are all they are, ciphers, instruments of the storyteller wielded as professionally and dispassionately as that claw hammer. As with most films that rely on visceral impact to transport the viewer, the densely plotted story disguises a wealth of plot holes that only rise to the surface of the viewer's consciousness after the deliberately ambiguous ending. Oh Dae-su's actions become increasingly erratic as the tale unfolds and he comes closer to learning the truth. Given the motives that drive his character, his intense feelings for the winsome Mi-do after just a few days don't ring true even after we are given an explanation for it but, as they are crucial to the eventual outcome, leave the impression that they have been shoehorned into the plot.Visually, the film is stunning, with superlative camera-work from Jeong-hun Jeong, and Choi min-sik gives a towering performance as the embittered anti-hero. Ji-tae Yu, in a smaller but no less important role, lacks for much of the film the tragic persona his part cries out for. For my money, his character would have worked better had he been given a darker persona haunted by the events that have driven him to pursue such an elaborate act of revenge over so many years.Despite these reservations about character and plot, the film is definitely a worthwhile addition to the growing number of imaginative and praiseworthy movies produced by Asian countries over the last decade. I've a feeling that time may dull its reputation, that the talented Chan-wook Park has not yet reached the peak of his talent and will produce work in the future that will surpass OLDBOY. Certainly, the top 100 rating it holds on this website is higher than it deserves.",Null,9,49,13 August 2005
Pirate Radio," The Boat That Sank
","I was really quite disappointed with this fictional tale of the pioneering rock and pop DJs of the 60s who played their music from rusty old ships off the coast of Britain. It's a good, different subject for a film, and the cavalier reputation of these pirate broadcasters means the film comes with a built-in rebel factor that appeals to everyone who likes to think that some remnants of the teen they used to be who hid under the sheets at night to listen to the stations fading in and out still linger on within them. These guys poked a finger (or two, as it was in those days) in the face of the crusty old establishment and earned the devotion of teens everywhere and the sneaking admiration of no small number of grown-ups. The establishment is represented here by Kenneth Branagh, who looks every part the stuffy middle-aged minister who clearly rues the fact that he was born thirty years too late to revel in Britain's glory days. Branagh's character, by the way, is by far the best in the film which, given the 'zany,' anarchistic attitudes of the DJs tells you all you need to know about what's wrong with The Boat That Rocked.So why doesn't this film work for me? Well, firstly the writers have come up with a great subject but have combined it with an incredible lack of imagination to come up with a level of writing that would struggle to beat a Carry On film for originality or laughs. It's mildly entertaining at best, and the plot is practically non-existent. This wouldn't be too bad if there were some funny set-pieces to bridge the inevitable lulls, but most of the humour comes across as, at best, simply forced, and at worst, some kind of half-hearted rip-off of those Robin Askwith Confessions films from the 70s. For example, early on in the film a 16-stone DJ (Nick Frost) comes up with the idea of swapping places with a 9-stone teen so that the young virgin can pop his cherry with the DJ's unsuspecting date in a darkened room. The idea is so lame it's almost embarrassing, and the entire sequence takes forever to build up to a micro-second pay-off.The film works really hard to be a fun, feel-good experience, but fatally lacks the calibre of material (or likable characters) necessary to pull it off. The DJs on-board the rusting hulk of Radio Rock are amusing parodies of well-known British DJs of the 70s (that rebellious streak was soon abandoned by the young turks when the BBC came knocking), but you just can't imagine the likes of Tony Blackburn or the Hairy Cornflake behaving the way these characters do. So, starved of the material it needs to create that feel-good factor, the film attempts to manufacture it by playing a shrewd choice of popular 60s classics over endless shots of people dancing around their radios like rejects from a Twiggy musical. It's sad to see the likes of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bill Nighy dragged down by such pedestrian treatments as this.",Null,1,3,5 January 2010
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Lightweight time-filler
","I can almost imagine that Kate Hudson accepted her role in this lightweight piece of fluff because she identified with the plight of her character, a journalist on a womens magazine who wants to write serious political pieces but ends up with the vacuous 'How to' column. After all, surely no serious actor can dream of appearing in films as insubstantial as this when they're slogging their way through drama college  even if they are 'kooky' Goldie Hawn's daughter. That said, Hudson should at least look at getting an agent who will negotiate equal screen time with her leading man.This isn't a bad film of its kind. It's a passable time-filler with likable leads who really shouldn't be considering the vain, conceited characters they play. Both believe they can snare a mate and have them fall in love with them  only with opposing objectives in mind  and go about their task with single-minded determination uncaring of what damage they may do to the other. There are a few laughs along the way  not many, but a few  and the ending is, of course, mind-numbingly predictable, but then it's obvious that nobody was out to win an Oscar here.",Null,0,0,25 September 2007
The Mummy," Running fast and moving backwards...
","This remake in name only of the 1932 Karloff movie of the same name is one of those blockbusters churned out by the studios each summer: slick, glossy, high-concept, and loaded with special effects which dispense with the need for any A-list stars. It demands nothing of the viewer other than the ability to follow the simplest of plots  'What's the plan?' asks rummy pilot Winston of our hero O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) at one point. 'Rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world,' replies O'Connell, and you can almost hear some secretary buzzing her faceless studio exec boss each September and reminding him it's time to get rolling on another of those 'save the damsel, kill the bad guy, save the world' flicks the kids like so much. The studios have created something of a rod for their own backs, however; each year, they have to outdo the previous year's product, which means ever greater effects  at the expense, of course, of such luxuries as plot and characterisation. That's not to say The Mummy is a bad film  it's not. It does exactly what it sets out to do which isn't to create a work of any artistic or creative merit but to provide the multiplex crowd with a visceral experience that they will tell their friends is 'cool' and 'awesome'. The film succeeds impressively at this. They will tell their friends it 'rocks', and then forget all about it after they see the next one off the production line. In 1984 Kyle Reese told Sarah Connor: 'It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.' Fifteen years later Ardeth Bay tells Rick O'Connell: 'This creature is a bringer of death. He will never eat, he will never sleep, he will never stop.' That's how far we've come.See what a lifetime of watching movies does to you? It turns you into a cynic. You begin to learn too much about the films you see, in a sense, so that it takes more than a few explosions and special effects to impress you. The trick is to switch off sometimes, to just let the whole experience roll over you like a gigantic noisy tidal wave that demands nothing of you other than to be swept away by its magnitude.This one stars Brendan Fraser, a strange leading man; he hasn't been out of work for fifteen years, and in that time he has starred in a string of critical and/or commercial successes and yet his name refuses to become a truly major one in the industry. It's as if he's cursed. He plays former legionnaire Rick O'Connell in this one, languishing in an Egyptian jail until he is saved from hanging by Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz), the world's sexiest librarian, in order that he can help her and her cowardly brother (John Hannah) to find the hidden city of Hamunaptra, where a unimaginable evil waits to be unleashed upon the world. Of course, unleashed it is, and we are subsequently treated to a succession of CGI effects that, six years on, range from mildly impressive to distinctly dodgy as our heroes dash from one predicament to another. It's all good mindless fun at first, A Raiders of the Lost Ark for a new generation, but with more emphasis on violence and gunplay and SFX. O'Connell is no smarter than Indiana Jones was, he's just a reactive hero who leaves all the thinking to the pretty Weisz, who is agreeably cute as the naïve and gullible Evelyn. Unfortunately, the constant fleeing from an assortment of perils that make up the whole of the second half of this movie grows increasingly tiresome after a while. I started growing impatient for the ending rather than worrying over the fate of Rick and Evelyn.All in all this is a fairly harmless film, an insignificant way to spend a couple of hours if you're going to watch this on the big screen. If you're going to watch this on TV, you're going to inevitably focus more on the acting and characterisation, the plot and continuity (which is truly atrocious at times) and the editing. Don't. Turn off that analytical part of your mind and watch with your eyes only. If you do that you're sure to have a lot of fun",Null,0,0,29 August 2005
Constantine," Too bad...
","If ever a film needed a clear mind and a firm hand this was it. Constantine was always going to find it hard to win the approval of the multiplex crowd due to the dark nature and bleak outlook of both its story and title character. Lacking the kind of built-in mass-market appeal of the likes of Batman, it would have to rely on stunning visuals and spectacular special effects as well as a riveting storyline to stand any chance of real success. As we all now know, it was a relative failure at the box-office, failing to even recoup its estimated budget in the US, and found few champions amongst the critics, gaining mixed reviews at best.The film itself attempts to fuse the noir ambiance of those shadowy PI tales of the 40s with the more contemporary spectacle of fantasy/horror which, on paper at least, should provide an intriguing and engrossing fable. And there is an epic aspect to the story, with its focus on demons and angels roaming a world that is the subject of a wager between their masters. But it is this ambitious sub-plot that derails what should be a potent concoction by providing an abundance of religious iconography that influences the direction of the tale in ways that damage the film as entertainment, despite presenting some tantalising glimpses of what could have been a fascinating exploration of good and evil and the grey in-between.Constantine is an exorcist of demons trying to step over into our world whose motivation is entirely personal Â– even though he is at first unable to see it. A suicide at an early age, he died for two minutes and sampled, as an appropriately punished Catholic, the damnations of hell before being resurrected. Doomed to return upon his final demise, he sends demons back to hell in the hope of buying his way into heaven. To make matters worse, he's running out of time: his lungs are black with cancer and he has a year left at best. Now this is the sort of subject matter that should either draw you in or repel you, depending on what floats your boat. Personally, I can't get enough of this dark stuff, so it's surprising that the film Constantine almost completely fails to convince you of the verisimilitude of its world. The effects look spectacular, but too often they get in the way of the plot rather than advancing it, and seem to serve too often as an inadequate substitute for atmosphere. This over-reliance on the fantastical also tends to leave the story so unfocused at times that the plot strays close to incoherence as it begins to spread in uncoordinated directions like an unattended stain. It's a shame, because the first half-hour or so looked promising.Keanu Reeves performs with all the integrity of a bloated movie star with a guaranteed pay packet. After twenty years in the business he still can't act, and seems to be attempting a kind of moody Clint Eastwood impersonation here. Needless to say, it doesn't work and Rachel Weisz, an appealing actress with only marginally more talent than her co-star, finds it tough to play off him with any success. Neither are helped by a script that stubbornly refuses to attempt anything more than a cursory study of their characters, leaving the audience dangerously adrift with no-one to care or root for. Tilda Swinton is a highlight as an angel called Gabriel, but her role is too small for her to make more than a passing impression, as is that of Peter Stormare's Satan.Despite its bad points, Constantine possesses some great ideas and it would be interesting to see a sequel that expands a little on the characters in the story while taking a step back from the special effects. After this first film's dismal performance, however, the chances of one turning up in the next few years appear decidedly small.",Null,0,5,16 November 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Not Exactly Butch and Sundance...
","Speaking as a straight man with a tolerance but also an aversion towards overt homosexuality which others might find shameful (but which is as much a product of my genetic make-up as others' sexual orientation is a result of theirs) I've got to say a film like this isn't one that I would queue to watch, but as a movie fan, I felt compelled to give it a go in view of the praise that was heaped upon it when it was first released.The film looks terrific, and I'm a patient man so the slow pace was no problem for me, but I felt the film failed in its attempt to provide a sympathetic portrayal of the two men forced to live a lie because of their love for one another. For a start the film seems to dismiss the fact that the lie they live also ruins the lives of those who love them: the wives who initially love them, the children whose homes are blighted. These people are portrayed as the chains that drag our duo down and whom they abandon whenever they can. The time Jack and Ennis spend together is all peaceful blue skies and green mountains, their time apart sleazy bars and tractor showrooms and, as I watched, it all started to seem a little too simplistic and by the numbers. The guilt is there, especially in Heath Ledger's Ennis Del Mar, but more often than not it is portrayed as resentment or anger towards his long-suffering wife  who, it has to be said, unaccountably allows the secret to remain just that long after she has stumbled upon the men's subterfuge.Heath Ledger outshines Gyllenhal in the acting stakes, communicating the inner torment of his character in often monosyllabic snatches of dialogue as he struggles with a truth about himself we are to assume he had never suspected existed before meeting Jack. His performance here is as understated as his Joker was deliberately over-the-top, and it's a mark of the man's ability that he manages to pull both performances off so well.The sex and intimacy scenes will probably prove distasteful to most straight men, but they are a necessary part of the film, and are treated neither gratuitously nor exploitatively. Having said that, it is only after Jack's death and in the portrayal of Ennis's quiet grief that I felt that any kind of chemistry had existed between the two men.",Null,1,6,6 March 2009
Terminator Salvation," Robo-Nator
","I couldn't help wondering to myself as I watched this fourth instalment of the Terminator franchise exactly why Christian Bale felt it was a film worth getting all emotional over during it's making. I never listened to his apparently despotic rant at some hapless crew member, but it was something to hear apparently. It would have cast a bad light upon Mr. Bale under any circumstances, but when he carries on like that over a piece of cinematic bubble gum like this you've really got to wonder whether he isn't taking himself a little too seriously.Bale plays John Connor, leader of the resistance against the robots of Skynet. He learns that Kyle Reese, the man who will eventually travel back in time to save his mother from Arnie Schwarzenneger but who is now just a teenager – this being the bit of time sandwiched between the future and the past (!) – is the number one termination target of Syknet When Reese inevitably gets himself captured, Connor must attempt to delay a planned all-out attack on the headquarters by the resistance to give him time to rescue the boy who will become the man who will save his mother and become his father. Or something.The fourth instalment bears no resemblance – and only passing relevance – to the first Terminator film, and has more of the look of a Mad Max episode – but with a muddier palette and a surprisingly subdued musical score. We're treated to a whole new army of different types of terminators – hydrobots, moto-terminators, etc – who look suspiciously like they have been added to the mix to give the marketing department some more tie-in toys to push, or to serve as an extended ad for the Playstation spin-off.

Match Point," Luck of the Irish
","MAJOR SPOILERFirst off, if I hadn't known in advance that this was a Woody Allen film, I would never have guessed: only once, in passing, is there any mention of neuroses. I'm not a great fan of Allen's, his brand of quirky comedy for the intelligentsia leaves me cold, but I decided to give this one a chance as it's not a comedy and the man himself doesn't appear.Overall, I'm glad I took the chance. In terms of story, Match Point is nothing new, influenced heavily as it is by Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, but it tells its story in an unhurried manner that is quite refreshing in an age when any scene lasting longer than five seconds seems to be considered a bad thing. The story unfolds quite believably, and the theme of the influence luck/chance/things beyond our control has on our lives is clear throughout without being overstated. It's not about moments of luck, it's about lucky people - and people don't come any luckier than the man who is cleared of the crime he committed by a piece of incriminating evidence he failed to dispose of properly. I liked the resonance of that moment when the old woman's wedding ring bounces on the metal railing, falling backwards (unluckily, we are led to believe), taking us back to the net at the start of the film. British, you see - we love irony for some reason.The performances are largely good. although Rhys Meyer's performance grated a little. He seems to get better as the film progresses, and I can't quite make up my mind whether his monotone delivery early on is due to poor acting or is meant to convey the attempts of an Irish boy to pull off a posh English accent. Brian Cox is a great actor, but has little to do here as the protagonist's father-in-law. Scarlett Johansson looks gorgeous and gives a good account of herself.",Null,1,2,5 July 2007
Yes Man," Maybe...
","A long time ago I read a book by Luke Rhinehart called the Dice Man in which a man allows all the decisions in his life to be made on the roll of a pair of die and, had I not known that this film is actually based on someone's real-life experiment, I would have considered this film to have been a variation on that basic concept. As it is, whereas Rhinehart's book understandably focused on the gradual erosion of the hero's character because he was no longer responsible for making any decisions in his life, this idea, which practically demands to be the core of a story like this, is only arbitrarily explored in the very last reel of Yes Man. It's one of the drawbacks of having to cater for a mass audience that is identified by its lowest common denominators, I suppose, but it means this film fails to be anywhere as near as interesting as it could have been.Jim Carrey is about ten years too old for the part of Carl, a bachelor with low self-esteem who is slowly cutting himself off from the world (essentially saying 'no' to it) whose life is turned around when he is practically press-ganged into a personality enhancement scheme in which he must say yes to all and any suggestions, instructions or requests. Cue much hilarity with our hapless hero giving his money to tramps, learning to speak Korean and fly a plane, approving loans to all and sundry in his job as a loans officer, and receiving oral 'pleasure' from the toothless old lady who lives next door.The film has some genuinely humorous moments and manages to generate an enjoyable feel-good atmosphere as Carl first discovers his life taking unexpected, life-affirming directions, but ironically the more his life seems to develop a focus – mostly in the form of Zooey Deschanel – the more the film starts to drift aimlessly. And when it does finally pull itself together for its final reel it manufactures such a ridiculous plot device (Zooey learns of his 'yes to anything philosophy' when he is arrested on suspicions of terrorist activities aroused by his free-spirited lifestyle) that you almost end up feeling the film wasn't as good as it actually was.",Null,0,1,24 September 2010
Zodiac," Intelligent and well-made...
","Films based on fact are naturally given a certain licence to include detail that would be cut from a fictional movie due to pacing and running time issues, so it's no wonder that Zodiac's running time is so long. Despite this, I never found the film anything less than fascinating (the only thing I knew about Zodiac was that Scorpio, Andy Robinson's character in Dirty Harry  which is referenced in this film  was based on him) and was surprised at how quickly the two-and-a-half-hours passed. Longer running times are OK as far as I'm concerned anyway  it means the producers are governed by things other than the number of daily screenings that can be squeezed in at the Multiplex Fincher's take on the killings and their inevitable repercussions is fairly solid. He clearly hasn't set out to provide the audience with thrills, but to examine the killings' impact on the characters involved in finding the killer  either officially or otherwise. Mark Ruffalo is believable as the dogged Inspector Toschi whose professionalism prevents him from allowing the case from taking over his life in the way it does Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), but which also prevents him from completely letting go. Gyllenhaal isn't my favourite actor by a long mark, but this is the type of role he is made for  slightly geeky and hesitant, more at home in a library than at a crime scene. To him the crime is a puzzle that has to be solved. Robert Downey plays dissolute journalist Paul Avery, a role for which he presumably had to do little research. In many ways, the effect of the case on Avery's life is more devastating than it is on Graysmith, and Downey is perfect for the part.Perhaps, the main flaw is that Fincher can't seem to decide whether to focus on the long hunt for the killer by Graysmith or the effect it has on his home life. While most of the screen time is devoted to Graysmith's dogged pursuit of Zodiac, the time devoted to his domestic life seems almost superfluous, as if it belonged to another, related, movie. Graysmith becomes a married father after just one scene of meeting his future wife, and the handling of Zodiac's telephone harassment of the family is handled almost perfunctorily, as is the eventual breakdown of the marriage. It almost seems as if Fincher feels obliged to include these details but isn't really very interested in them. And while the film is supposed to perhaps leave questions unanswered (even though it leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind as to who it believes the culprit to be), some of the questions that remain you feel should have been addressed.In a genre that leans toward the stalk-and-slash mentality, Zodiac stands out as an absorbing, intelligent and tightly constructed entry that is more than worth a look.",Null,1,2,6 December 2007
Silent Hill," Like watching somebody else playing the game...
","By definition, any film version of a PC game that sticks as close to the plot of the game as this film appears to do is going to lose the vicarious thrill a player enjoys when playing the game. Watching this film has to be pretty much like sitting next to somebody you don't know while they play the game. The impressive visuals of the ghost town wrapped in a haze of white ash from the fires that have burned beneath it for thirty years can only keep you interested for so long and, once the action goes underground, the interminable succession of shots of plucky mum Radha Mitchell running down dark corridors away from vaguely defined phantoms as she searches for her daughter quickly grows boring. Character development is non-existent  which, again, is OK with a game because you are the hero, but is a death knell to any film  and, as he did in The Dark, Sean Bean once again plays the most pointless of characters. Completely passive, adding nothing to the plot, and serving only to offer an occasional change of scene from the dim alleyways of Silent Hill, he is totally redundant. The guy must really be desperate to crack the US market to accept a role like this.

Snatch," If it's not broke, don't fix it.
","It's good to see that Guy Ritchie's next movie is set far from London's criminal underworld, because it's fair to say that he has probably wrung every last drop of entertainment from the (identical) subject matter of his first two features.  In fact, he wrung the flannel dry, because one of the twists in SNATCH (an attempt to sell goods back to the person they were stolen from), is a direct lift from LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS; Now, I don't mind this sort of thing going on when an old idea is re-processed, but, as a writer, if you find yourself stealing from your previous work so soon, you don't ask how much is left in the well, you wonder how much was in there in the first place.SNATCH contains the same frenetic pace and kinetic direction as its predecessor, and a gritty, bleached-out colour, while having much more of a sixties feel (despite the surfeit of 70s/80s music), and containing a lot more quirky (or flashy, depending on your opinion) touches.   Where this movie does improve on LS&TSB, however, is in injecting a potent dose of pathos into the necessary elements of the plot.   It's a shame, then, that a certain sense of self-satisfaction on the part of writer-director Ritchie is evident in the over-elaborate stylisation.The strands of the story bind together well as the movie approaches its climax (although the conclusion of the black guys' tale is a little lame), and Ritchie coaxes a far better performance from Vinnie Jones than the one he gave in LS&TSB.   Brad Pitt is especially good in a role that he should have stunk in.I liked this movie a lot, although you might not think so from what I've written.   Maybe that's a testimony to Ritchie's undoubted ability to deliver a well-made and entertaining story that is strong enough to overcome shortcomings that will, hopefully, be addressed as his career progresses.",Null,0,1,3 August 2002
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The Closest of Shaves...
","This Tim Burton adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical is filled with the dark and twisted visions we have come to expect from the director, and this musical/horror is a rare example of the two genres working well together, largely because of a range of eccentric characters effectively interpreted by a highly competent cast.Johnny Depp leads the way as Benjamin Barker, once a barber with a young family but now transformed into the brooding madman Todd by false imprisonment imposed on him by the reptilian Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) so that he can get his hands on Barker's beautiful wife. As Helen Bonham-Carter's Mrs Lovett observes, the years ain't been kind to Barker and he is consumed by a rage against Turpin that, when frustrated in his attempted murder of the judge, he diverts toward any hapless soul who happens to sit in his chair. Rounding out the cast are Sacha Baron Cohen as a fake Italian barber who becomes Todd's first victim, Timothy Spall as Turpin's wonderfully odious sidekick, and a rather bland Jamie Campbell-Bower as Anthony, the young sailor who falls for Todd's daughter.Most of the dialogue is sung by the actors, and none of them appear to have voice doubles judging by some of the vocal performances, but this somehow manages to strengthen the technique rather than weaken it. The tunes, for the most part, aren't exactly tuneful anyway but the sometimes lacklustre stretches are counter-pointed by some wonderful flourishes from Burton. Depp, having just about mastered the English accent, gives a towering performance. He is the film and, too a large degree, whether it stands or falls rests squarely on his shoulders. Depp is versatile enough to carry it off with aplomb, however, and develops a nice twisted chemistry with Bonham-Carter. The pair play well off of each other and the perverse family unit they form with young tearaway Toby (Ed Sanders) serves to emphasise where Todd's and Lovett's ambitions part company.It has to be said that this film may prove to be something of an acquired taste. Musicals like this spend much of their time allowing characters to express feelings that couldn't be verbally expressed in a more straightforward narrative without losing credibility. Although I enjoyed it well enough while watching, I'm not sure I'd be particularly inclined to watch it again.",Null,0,0,2 June 2008
Nacho Libre," Weak Black Humour
","Following the trend in Hollywood these days to make comedies that contain no laughs, we are here presented with an original idea (a Mexican wrestling monk) with which its producers do absolutely nothing remotely humorous or entertaining. For me, Jack Black's talent is minuscule, and it's only a matter of time before he's finally found out: teenagers have to grow up someday, and their younger brothers and sisters will instinctively avoid anything their older siblings used to find amusing. The wrestling bouts could have been achingly funny if directed well, but they are skimmed over and, instead of containing the film's highlights, they seem to be getting in the way of the story the film wants to tell. On the plus side, the film looks good for a multiplex comedy, with good use of colour.",Null,0,1,4 July 2007
Battleship Potemkin," Epic Propaganda
","Undoubtedly one of the most influential movies from the silent years of cinema, Sergei Eisenstein's recounting of the 1905 naval mutiny by sailors on the Potemkin has been referenced by so many other movies that you'd be forgiven for thinking that much of its power would have faded over the years. It is perhaps then a measure of the technical accomplishment of the 27-year-old director that the film looks remarkably fresh today and still possesses the ability to move modern-day viewers.The story is a deceptively simple one, focusing more on the actions of the people/proletariat as a whole than any particular individuals, and yet it is laden with a symbolism that relentlessly hammers home the propagandistic ideology of its Communist party backers. It is impossible to see the events unfold with an unbiased eye because all who fall outside of the Party's rigorously defined circle of revolutionary heroes are portrayed as weasel-like characters who stroke their waxed moustaches while caring nothing for the plight of those beneath them. No doubt there must have been an element of this at the time, but this one-sided depiction simply reinforces the impression that we are watching a none-too-subtle exercise in what can perhaps most charitably be described as occasional deviation from reality.Technically, however, the film excels. While abandoning any particularly characterisation, Eisenstein focuses on the human face of the revolution by having Eduard Tisse's camera pay close attention to the faces of the participants. He constantly uses close-ups on a wide range of characters to show us the heroic stoic features of the young sailors, the seamed faces of grieving women, the heartless smirks of ship's officers and even the hypocritical standards of the church. Eisenstein's pioneering of montage and overlapping editing is much in evidence. The first rebellious act, the smashing of a plate by a disgusted sailor is shown from different angles, giving an action that would take only an instant in real time a power and resonance that would otherwise be difficult to create. Later, when a sneering member of the bourgeoisie sneeringly heckles a woman protester, the reaction shot of a man turning around is edited so that a close-up frame is sandwiched been medium shots, giving the moment an immediacy and element of threat. It's the mark of a cinematic genius and must have been incredibly heady stuff to see back in the 1920s - it isn't difficult to see how such mastery of editing technique would have inspired a generation of movie makers.The film is packed with memorable sequences, the most intense and powerful of which is the famous Odessa Steps sequence. If ever the genius of Eisenstein was in doubt one would only have to point at this incredible sequence that still manages to excite and horrify an audience eighty years after it was filmed. While mainstream audiences might find this film difficult to watch today, true cinema aficionados will recognise it for the early masterpiece it is. It's just a shame so few of us will get the opportunity to experience its power on a full-size cinema screen",Null,2,4,16 October 2005
Taxi Driver," On every street in every city, there's a nobody who dreams of being a somebody...
","Taxi Driver is one of the first earnest studies of urban alienation that, in a very real sense, predicted many of the inevitable consequences such a condition spawns, and from which America (and Britain) has suffered over the past two decades. It proved to be a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy when, less than five years after it was filmed, a loner shot the US president to impress an actress who had appeared in this film. The implications of this are a little frightening when you think about it Robert De Niro is scarily convincing as Travis Bickle, a nondescript Vietnam vet who observes the dissolution on the streets of New York from the isolation of his cab. Each night he drives the streets, witnessing a tide of depravity that spills into the back of his cab, and each morning, after his shift, he has to wipe from the back seat the results of those intrusions. That's a bad enough experience for any man, but Travis is a loner who longs for a normal life and relationships but is too inarticulate and confused to be able to obtain them. He ruins his chance with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), campaign worker for a senator seeking election, by taking her to a porn film on their first date, and is genuinely confused when she takes exception to such behaviour. As Bickle tries to win her back on a public phone, his face hidden from the viewer, the camera pans away from him to focus on a corridor leading to the street as if embarrassed for him, and from then on, as his descent into madness gathers pace, Travis seems to edge further toward the edge of the screen in almost every shot.Bernard Herrmann's score superbly captures both the sleazy side of the New York streets and the sense of foreboding that permeates the entire film. Scorsese guides us through Bickle's increasingly disturbed state of mind without resorting to sensationalism or cheap manipulation of the audience, and Paul Schrader's intelligent script creates a completely believable character in Bickle as an unremarkable everyman who shares our standards of what's right and wrong but with a skewed perspective that has turned him into a ticking time-bomb. Only the speed with which Bickle and Iris develop a relationship and the contentious ending, for which too many people try to find a hidden meaning, weakens the film overall. That ending just doesn't sit right with the rest of the film  and Scorsese himself has discounted theories that it may be a dream sequence  but that shouldn't dissuade anyone with an interest in intelligent, thought-provoking films to catch this one at least once.",Null,4,6,4 September 2005
Barry Lyndon," Superb
","SPOILERSAlmost universally panned upon its original release in 1975, BARRY LYNDON has since been more favourably re-appraised by critics.   No bad thing, then, that time and perspective allow one to appreciate a work of art such as this, because, in many respects, it is one of Kubrick's finest achievements.Based on the 1844 novel by William Makepeace Thackeray, the movie chronicles the life of Redmond Barry, a working class Irish boy, from the days of his innocent love for his feckless cousin, through to his eventual downfall having almost attained the status he so desired.   Lyndon is a deeply flawed man, joyless and selfish, and unable to blame his shortcomings on his experiences as his journey draws ever closer to its inevitable, and tragic, conclusion.   His character is finely drawn by Kubrick, and superbly presented by Ryan O'Neal in a career-best performance; each adventure leaves it's indelible mark on Lyndon, irrevocably erasing the innocent and tender young man we witness in the early scenes, and seamlessly transforming him into a cynical, grasping womaniser whose few redeeming features are smothered by his obsessive and destructive desire for a title.   The transformation is undergone so subtly that one doubts Lyndon is ever truly aware that he has changed.    It is ironic that the two noble acts he does perform  warning the Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee) that he has been sent to spy on him, and deliberately firing into the ground after his stepson has accidentally fired his pistol during their agonisingly tense duel  respectively begin and complete his downfall.The film itself is an absolute delight to watch, and my only regret is that I didn't see it on the big screen.   Kubrick composes each establishing shot like a painting, ensuring views of stately homes are viewed across lakes or forests, and framed by overhanging branches or shrubs and bushes to add depth and focus.   He turns the screen into a canvas, an oil painting in motion that overwhelms the senses and makes you want to step into the screen to get a closer look.   The movie was accused of being boring upon its release, but this is the intelligent and melancholic story of a man's life being lovingly told, not some 90 minute crowd-pleaser with the bottom line in mind.   I wasn't bored for a second, and could quite happily have watched on for another three hours.",Null,3,5,16 September 2002
Notting Hill," Dull and unfunny
","First (or second) impression is that Notting Hill doesn't bear more than one viewing. I originally gave this light comedy 3.5/5, but on seeing it a second time could only give it a 2.5  and I think even that might be a little generous. There's too much about this film now that irritates: the slow pace at which the story unfolds, Hugh Grant's trademark hesitant quirkiness, Julia Roberts' cloying 'I'm just a girl' line, etc. And behind it all is the unshakable suspicion that Richard Curtis is running on autopilot, simply rehashing the same themes that worked so well for him with Four Weddings but which come across as so contrived here as to be nearly cynical. For example, choosing to have one character confined to a wheelchair seems either unashamedly manipulative or simply included to add a little something to the 'biggest loser' speech in the dinner party scene  which doesn't really work anyway.Grant is almost a parody of the old image he has since gone to some lengths to shed: a dithering, stuttering, self-conscious throwback to the Ian Carmichael school of acting. Perhaps attempting to broaden the film's appeal beyond that of the middle-class, Curtis attempts an injection of crude humour in the form of Thacker's witless lodger, Spike. Spike is a working-class lout with dirty feet and a poor taste in tee-shirts, and so is exactly the type that someone like Thacker would run a mile from. But then, this is a film which seems to specialise in unlikely relationships: perhaps, being a heterosexual male, I'm not really in a position to venture an opinion but, to me, it's impossible to see what a Hollywood mega-star like Scott would see in a knob like Thacker. But then I suppose that's the idea  Curtis is simply exploiting that juvenile fantasy that lives, to some degree, within all of us. Perhaps that is why so many people buy into what is essentially a half-baked comedy with improbable situations, characters who have little history beyond the boundaries of the story, and very few laughs.",Null,0,1,6 September 2006
The Aviator," The Aviator
","Howard Hughes' life was like a dark fairy tale, one in which the hero woos all the princesses and becomes a hero to the people, but at a terrible personal price. Chiefly remembered by most people as the loony billionaire recluse of the 70s who shuffled around his penthouse hotel suite with his feet in tissue boxes, he was, of course, a genius. And, like many geniuses, he balanced precariously on that line that divides genius and madness for much of his life before toppling irrevocably over in a fashion as spectacular as the air crash that left him with nearly 80% burns.With their opening scene, a strangely eroticised 'flashback' of Hughes as a boy being bathed by his mother and warned about cholera and typhus and q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e, Scorsese and scriptwriter John Logan seem to place the blame for Hughes' subsequent phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder squarely on the shoulders of his mother. This may be true, but a solitary scene before moving on to the filming of Hell's Angels does little to convince or inform, or provide credible background for Hughes' subsequent mental problems.Apart from this one scene, the film focuses on an approximately twenty-year period from 1927 to the Brewster Senate hearings and Hughes' piloting of the Spruce Goose after WWII. Hughes' love life, his engineering and business genius, and his increasing phobia over germs are given pretty much equal screen time, and the film does a reasonable job of slowly focusing more on the phobias as they begin to take over his life. Strangely enough, you'd think this aspect of his life would make up the more interesting part of the film, but it's when Hughes is shown at his most damaged that the film begins to drag. The imagery at this point is clumsy and uninspired and the film threatens to veer as badly out of control as Hughes did. Perhaps that was Scorsese's intention, but you're left with the impression of having been given a peep at a freak show rather than an examination of a man's breakdown.Leonardo Di Caprio continues to surprise with his success at tackling difficult roles for which he would seem to be unsuitable. He gives an entirely believable and sympathetic performance here, capturing both the energy of the man and the mental and emotional insecurities he suffered, while managing to avoid the pitfalls that are inherent to such a part. The supporting cast also deliver uniformly excellent performances. Cate Blanchett, while not really resembling Katharine Hepburn, manages to capture her tone and inflections and mannerisms, while Kate Beckinsale is passable despite never really capturing the essence of Ava Gardner in the same way that Blanchett does with Hepburn.This being a Scorsese film, it is, of course, technically brilliant. His decision to play with colour on some scenes is perhaps a little misguided, but he does tone down his often kinetic style, which would have been wholly inappropriate for a story like this. There are some great aerial shots and an incredible air crash, but the highlight for me was the barnstorming Brewster Senate Committee Hearings in which the malicious senator, excellently portrayed here by Alan Alda, is torn to shreds by a briefly recuperated Hughes.While this film isn't flawless, it's doubtful that we will see a better biopic about Howard Hughes. It's just a shame that so many of the CGI effects are so blatantly shoddy.",Null,0,1,6 November 2005

Burn After Reading," Comedy and Violence
","This isn't a typical laugh-out-loud comedy, which in a way means that it *is* a typical Coen Brother's comedy. Laced with noir trimmings, black humour and some vicious violence it's a story that could just as easily have been told straight. In fact, you can almost imagine the brothers Coen rubbing their chins contemplatively as they try to decide which way to film it. They cast Brad Pitt and George Clooney in key roles, so maybe they wanted to leave their options open.Pitt and Clooney are terrific in this. For an actor with matinée idol looks Clooney in unusually adept at playing amiable doofuses. In this one he's a serial philanderer who hooks up with Frances McDormand, a gym employee who has formed a blackmailing partnership with fellow employee Brad Pitt, a not-too-bright but enthusiastic guy with carefully coiffured hair. They found a disc in the gym changing room containing the memoirs of 'retired' CIA agent John Malkovitch after it was accidentally left there by his wife (Tilda Swinton) who was gathering information in preparation for a divorce. Clooney and Malkovitch are former colleagues who despise each other. The story is as involved as it reads but it is quite easy to follow.The violence in the film doesn't always sit easily with the humour. One murder is so totally unexpected that it sort of shocks you out of the film for a moment, and leaves you half-expecting some kind of twist that will bring the murdered character back to life. But then, I suppose that's the Coen's way: they can take a story and characters that aren't quite realistic, lulling us into a kind of false sense of security that nothing truly disagreeable is going to happen to them, and then inject moments of brutal and realistic violence just to shake us up.This maybe isn't the best of the Coen's films, but it's pretty good; and it suggests that they're a long way from running out of fresh ideas.",Null,1,3,22 July 2009
Watchmen," As Good As Anyone Could Expect It To Be.
","Given the variable quality of recent super-hero screen adaptations – from adequate to incompetent – this big, bold version of Alan Moore's legendary comic book is as good as anyone could realistically expect it to be. I read the compilation comic book (called a 'graphic novel' so that grown-ups didn't have to feel embarrassed about buying it) more than 20 years ago and was impressed by its sour, jaundiced view of the world – but then, I was only in my early twenties. And while I was impressed, I came away still thinking it was a good comic book and nothing more. Certainly no literary work of genius as some would have us believe. The makers here were left with something of a quandary: stay faithful to the book and you please the fans but get destroyed by the critics; make it more appealing and understandable to an audience with no knowledge of the book and you won't be able to hear the critic's praise over the howls of protest from the fans. Thankfully, they stayed (mostly) faithful to the book – even Rorshach's clipped way of speaking is retained.As I prefer film to cartoons, I prefer the film to the graphic novel. The film can – and does – create a depth of mood and atmosphere that the comic book has no hope of matching, and as I watched the terrific opening shots of an alternative past unfolding beneath the credits I started feeling really pleased I'd bothered to pick up a copy of the DVD. For the most part, the characters in Snyder's film (and until now I've considered him highly over-rated) are no cartoons come to life but real flesh and blood characters. They're not deep, full-rounded characters, admittedly, but they at least have a measure of depth lacking from comparable flicks. The film retains the dark, noirish atmosphere of the comic, and even though it's a long time since I read the comic, I'm pretty sure that many shots are exact replicas of the comic-book panels they're adapting.The violence, while difficult to take at times, is also in keeping with the comic – where gory scenes of mutilation can never be as shocking as when it's recreated on celluloid – and it's again credit to the makers that they didn't bow to the inevitable pressure to tone things down in order to get a lower age classification rating and so boost their profits. Remove the violence and you remove the guts of the story and all you're left with is a companion piece to the adventures of Peter Parker.If you haven't read the book you're probably initially going to struggle to understand what's going on – even though the film takes a long time filling in the back-story (which is why the running time is so long). Sadly, in this age of the post-MTV generation, this means a level of patience is required on the part of the audience that may be beyond the capabilities of some. However, if you've read the book, I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy this. Let's just hope there isn't a Watchmen II",Null,1,3,30 November 2009
The Bourne Identity," You just can't get the staff...
","The Bourne franchise is one that has, for no particular reason, passed me by until now and it was only because I noticed the DVD on sale for a stupidly cheap price and been assured by friends that all three films were worth watching that I've now seen the first film. Assuming the law of diminishing returns applies to this franchise, I don't think I'll be seeking out the other two Bourne flicks in a hurry. That's not to say this film is bad  it's not; it's a well-made action film, slick and glossy, with some nice European locations  but there is just nothing particularly special about it, and the last ten minutes completely ruin what has gone before.Matt Damon plays the central character, a government assassin who is pulled out of the sea by a fishing boat with no recollection of who he is and a collection of bullets nestling just under his skin. The rest of the film concerns Damon's efforts to discover just who  and what  he is, aided by a German gypsy in the shapely form of Franka Potente, while he simultaneously tries to evade the CIA contract killers out to eliminate what they now consider to be a rogue agent. Potente, with her de-glamourised look, is as well cast as Damon is not. He's too preppy looking to convince as a cold-blooded killer  even one working for the land of the free. He looks like he'd run a mile if the saloon drunk decided he didn't like the look of his stubble-free face. Perhaps director Liman understood this because the fight sequences are edited at such a lightning pace that we're not really given much time to see what is going on. Sometimes the camera seems so close you half expect a flailing fist to catch the cinematographer a glancing blow.Anyway, Bourne's quest follows a fairly eventful and predictable path, one that is strewn with a number of fist fights, a well-filmed car chase, a little rumpy with his new travelling companion and one welcome moment of dry humour when Potente over-rides Damon's convoluted plan to obtain vital information from a hotel through covert means by simply asking the hotel concierge to tell her what they need to know. Although Bourne remembers nothing of his past, he has retained the killer instinct as well as the smarts to gradually pull most of the strands together, which results in the inevitable showdown with his former boss  a role effortlessly nailed by the woefully under-used Chris Cooper, an actor who is the epitome of class.Those last ten minutes, though first, we're expected to believe this highly-trained cold-hearted killer is unable to eliminate his target because of the cute button-nosed kid sleeping in the mark's lap. As if his employers wouldn't have tested him in this kind of situation. It really is a terrible moment that left me gawping. If he suddenly had an attack of conscience could we please have some kind of clue as to why? Maybe the CIA boobed  perhaps Bourne ticked the box marked 'I do not wish to assassinate cute innocent children on covert assignments of national importance.' Anyway, Bourne hesitates, raises his gun and  BAM  their go two stars from the movie's rating. I almost dropped another star for that stupid falling through the air on the back of a dead fat man stunt, but the film had already been spoiled for me by then so it didn't really matter",Null,0,1,7 October 2008

Salt," Salt - As in 'to be taken with a pinch of...'
","About fifteen years ago the big screen became swamped with adaptations of comic book superheroes, both well-known and relatively obscure. One of the reasons for this was because filmmakers were able to take advantage of computer-generated effects whose sophistication rose in direct correlation to their drop in price. Today, with the superhero well more or less run dry, they've decided we no longer need to be fooled into believing the kid next door can develop super-powers when he's bitten by a radioactive spider. Hell, why go to such extreme lengths to justify the use of mind-blowing sfx? We'll just make the hero a medium-height, underweight woman who can balance on two-inch ledges ten floors up, leap from the roof of one moving container lorry to another, descend a lift shaft with acrobatic grace, emerge from a spectacular car smash without a limp or a grimace, and beat the crap out of trained men twice her size.The movie Salt is wrong in so many ways and on so many levels that it's difficult to know where to begin. Cynicism abounds – from the writers who believe a protracted chase sequence lasting forty-five minutes is actually writing (lets face it, the film's first forty-five minutes probably used up maybe three pages of double-spaced script) and that inserting an increasingly ludicrous plot twist every five minutes will divert everyone's attention from all the other plot deficiencies, to the leading lady who undoubtedly knows a lucrative little franchise when she sees one. Philip Noyce directs with panache, but then he has to in order to paper over all the cracks.In the film's defence, it's fair to say that probably nobody involved took it particularly seriously, and so the audience should really treat it the same way. Because it does provide a mindless entertainment, even though your neck will ache (unlike Evelyn Salt's) from all the shaking of your head as the audacious plot unfolds.",Null,3,6,28 June 2011
Duck Soup," Laughing at us...
","This concentrated dose of typically manic Marx lunacy is widely considered to be the high point of the brother's career, and it isn't difficult to see why. The daft (and incidental) storyline has Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) becoming ruler of Freedonia at the behest of Mrs. Gloria Teasdale (the redoubtable Margaret Dumont), who has been financially bailing out the principality for years and who has something of a soft spot for Firefly. The oily Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania (Louis Calhern), however, also has designs on Freedonia and Mrs. Teasdale, and before long the two nations are at war.The Marx Brothers brand of comedy is something of an acquired taste, and this inspired lunacy is probably the best introduction possible to their work. Although poor Zeppo is still hanging around with nothing much to do (this was his last film), the musical numbers are short and kept to a minimum, and the pace never flags. Some of the sight gags perpetrated by Harpo and Chico – especially when tormenting the hapless Edgar Kennedy – are so fast that you are left as surprised as Kennedy is when he finds himself carrying Harpo's leg while trying to retain hold of his hat. I remember loving the Marx Brothers as a kid, but I was always a little wary of Harpo: those staring eyes and mute grins still put me in mind of a malevolent clown. In the real world his childish antics would earn him a swift beating, but in the world of the Marx Brothers he survives every (often mean-spirited) prank unscathed. While Harpo's abuse is physical, Groucho's is verbal. Both are relentless, and both leave their foils speechless with indignation. It's a routine that could quickly go stale were the quips and one-liners not so expertly written and delivered. And there never was a better foil than Margaret Dumont, with her pained reactions, and her unfailing ability to miss the fact that she is the butt of Groucho's jokes.The film contains a wealth of classic moments, including the oft-copied mirror sequence in which Harpo, made up to look like Groucho, mimics his actions as he stands in a doorway and pretends to be a mirror reflection. The most sublime touch comes, not with each (mostly) well-timed mime, but when Harpo, copying Groucho, whips a white hat out from behind his back. Harpo points and laughs, but he's laughing at us as much as Groucho, because we saw that the hat was black when he originally walked into view and he knew we were expecting his ruse to be discovered when the hat was revealed. It's the subtle touches such as these, so far ahead of their time in the early thirties, which mark the Marx Brothers as one of moviedom's few acts of comedy genius.",Null,1,2,1 April 2010
Apocalypse Now," Coppola and Milius: The Hollow Men
","Apocalypse Now is a film about madness, about its attendant chaos and about the many forms it takes at a time when the (American) world and war has gone awry. It's not an easy film to watch and, unless I have seriously misunderstood the intentions of the filmmakers, it is neither successful nor the masterpiece so many claim it to be. The themes of madness and chaos in this film could also, it seems, be applied to both its making and the inexplicable reactions it has provoked Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness, inspired also by T. S. Eliot's darkest works, and containing an implicit suggestion that established narrative structure cannot adequately describe the darkness of man's soul in the modern world, the impression is that Coppola fully succeeded in achieving everything he set out to achieve: a thinking man's take on the collective madness that engulfed the US hierarchy and destroyed a generation of its young men. Trouble is, Coppola was making movies while they were fighting, and co-writer John Milius's chronic asthma prevented him from military service, so that what we have here is a philosophical study that lacks the necessary component of personal experience  and it shows. While that doesn't make Coppola and Milius's view any less valid, the self-indulgent nature of some of the passages becomes unacceptable. Sheen's narration sounds like something out of a cheap pulp fiction novel at times and, when you get right down to it, all we have here is the same message being hammered into our brains over and over and over again.This is one of those films that fuses art with populism so, between all those long sequences in which Coppola focuses on mythic narrative and dwells on its place and purpose in the midst of a brutal war, we get to see surfing soldiers and crowd-pleasing helicopter attacks played out to the thundering strains of the Ride of the Valkyrie, and sex-starved soldiers rioting over a trio of gyrating Playboy bunnies. Apocalypse Now is a self-perpetuating legend whose reputation, like the war it depicts, has grown out of control.",Null,2,6,20 November 2005
Disturbia," Watching them watching him watching them
","DJ Caruso's teen riff on Hitch's voyeuristic classic Rear Window (with enough changes to avoid having to buy the rights) is better than most movies aimed at this market group, but succeeds more in reminding you how good the 50s version was than in establishing any reputation of worth for itself.Shia LeBouef takes on the Jimmy Stewart role but this time, just to show how much times have changed, he's disabled not by a broken leg but by one of those surveillance devices strapped to his leg after he 'pops' his Spanish teacher. Bored to distraction by his incarceration at home, Kale (LaBeouf) takes to spying on the neighbours  especially sexy new girl next door, Ashley (Sarah Roemer). That's right  our hero is a peeping tom with anger management issues. The other neighbour to grab his attention is sinister bachelor Robert Turner (David Morse) who seems to fit the description of a serial killer of young redheads that seems to be perpetually broadcast on TV. Teaming up with hot young Ashley who, we later surmise, considers the news that he has covertly been ogling her body the 'sweetest thing she's ever heard'  and best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), Kale tries to get the evidence he needs to put Turner away.After a terrific opening car smash that sees Kale lose his father, the film takes it's time to get going, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing as it gives us a chance to get to know our hero a little better. Trouble is, there isn't really that much to get to know: Kale is a typically grumpy teen with more activity going on in his pants than his head. LeBeouf, 21 when this was made, plays the part well as does Roemer, his partner in crime. Only Yoo comes across as laboured, in the best friend role whose fate is so 'unexpected' that these days it's becoming as much of a stereotype as the narrative convention it tries to avoid..All in all, this is an adequate time-filler, if nothing more. It avoids the brain-jangling MTV style of editing and resists for the most part the temptation to pepper the plot with cheap shocks. While it tries to add a little depth to its characters, too often it is done in a half-hearted manner (for example, the perceived friction in the Carlson household is hinted at but never expanded upon). The film could also have benefited from more attention being placed upon the psychological aspects of the cat-and-mouse game played by Turner and Kale once the former knows the latter is onto him.The plot holes and character inconsistencies are mostly confined to the final couple of reels, during which the whole thing threatens to fall apart completely (Turner's typical suburban house is the size of a castle inside, complete with dungeon and tiled-wall abattoir) but, as with many films like this, this set-up seems to be considered more important than the pay-off...",Null,0,2,22 February 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Coming Out of the Box
","This comedy was better than I expected, although considering the questionable quality of movie comedy coming out of the States these days, that isn't saying too much. The writers set themselves something of a tricky task in a way: making Andy nerdy enough to still be a believable virgin and yet still likable enough for his workmates to want to help him lose his virginity rather than simply make them the butt of their jokes (which, let's face it, is probably what would have happened in real life). The film's quite likable in that respect, always sympathising with its main character while making him the subject of its humour which, for the most part, manages to rise just above the gross juvenile level you might expect. Having said that, there's no belly laughs here, just a lot of wry smiles. And at nearly two-and-a-quarter-hours, this film, like Andy's virginity, lasts for way too long...",Null,2,3,10 April 2007
Dunkirk," Dunkirk review

Tropic Thunder," Consistently Funny
","I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. Most modern Hollywood comedies leave me cold; they barely seem to have more than one or two decent laughs each, but this one had me chuckling throughout. The story is complete tosh, but of course it isn't supposed to be taken seriously, and most of the biggest laughs are found in the interplay between the five hapless heroes anyway.Director and co-writer Ben Stiller stars as Tugg Speedman, waning star of six Scorcher movies, who finds himself abandoned in the middle of some Asian jungle with the co-stars of his latest flick, Tropic Thunder, after the movie's director (Steve Coogan) takes exception to their prima donna antics on set. Unfortunately, their location happens to be slap bang in the middle of territory controlled by a vicious gang of drug smugglers although, as Coogan has told them they will be filmed by hidden cameras as they make their way out of the jungle, it's a good while before they realise the danger they are in is genuine.The film takes humorous swipes at Hollywood, its movers and shakers and its product with a sure footing and an insider's knowledge. It also has a refreshing awareness of its own precarious position as it adroitly avoids descending into the crass juvenile humour of spoof movies. I liked the way it wasn't afraid to point a finger at the absurdity of its own profession (check out that spoof trailer for Kirk Lazarus's monks-in-love movie in which he is hailed as five time Oscar winner, and Toby Maguire is introduced as winner of MTV best kiss scene of the year award winner – and, of course, Speedman and Lazarus's infamous discussion about the pitfalls of going 'full retard' – to see what I mean), while never turning snide or cynical as it does so. Stiller and his co-writers are extracting the urine for sure, but there's no doubt they're doing it in an affectionate way.While everyone gives great comical performances, Tom Cruise, somehow getting away with playing an instantly recognisable foul-mouthed megalomaniac movie executive, steals the show in his relatively few scenes. He's got the moves, and he knows how to sell a G5. Where Cruise is over-the-top hilarious, Downey's Kirk Lazarus, barely recognisable under his altered skin pigmentation, is consistently funny in a low-key way as one of those irritating actors who insist on going deep into character. I was still chuckling over his scene with the black guy late in the film ('so are we cool now?' 'No, not really.') when Tom danced us out over the end credits.This is honestly one of the best Hollywood comedies I've seen in years so even if, like me, you usually steer clear, give this one a go – you won't be disappointed.",Null,1,4,19 October 2009

Dirty Dancing," Celluloid bubblegum
","This is possibly one of those films that will remain popular with women who were teenagers when it first came out, but quickly become forgotten when, in another 40-50 years or so, those said women start falling off their perches. My 30-something partner barely moved for its duration, whisked back by its cheesy tunes and Patrick Swayze's finely toned body to her mid-teens for a couple of hours. Afterwards, she admitted that it's pretty stupid, but films that take us back to our youth usually are.The film briefly made a star of Swayze, and it's not difficult to see why he got the part of the beefcake dancing instructor who uses his looks and movements to seduce the wealthy wives who frequent the summer resort where he works (even though he was probably 10 years too old for the part). But it's Jennifer Grey as Baby who gives the performance of the film for my money, injecting an energetic enthusiasm into the scenes between those in which she is a nervous waif or put-upon younger sister. She's a pretty thing, but her looks are unconventional, and not designed for long-lasting stardom.The story is pure candy-floss, and not intended to be taken seriously, and there's little attempt at recapturing the fifties era in which the story takes place, but it all looks very handsome and the director captures some moments that even today, nearly a quarter of a century after it was made, remain in the collective movie-going consciousness.",Null,1,3,30 September 2009
The Butterfly Effect," Should have paid attention to Homer J.
","Time travel films are nothing new – movies have featured them since before they could talk – and it is difficult for any movie-maker to inject something fresh into the genre. In fact, every kid who's seen that Simpsons' episode where Homer keeps travelling back in time with ever-increasingly catastrophic repercussions knows that messing with time can alter the world's time-line to a devastating degree. Anyway, co-writers/directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber obviously saw that episode too and, deciding to link it to the chaos theory that is so fashionable these days, have managed to fashion a story that is every bit as flawed as it is entertaining.Ashton Kutcher is Evan Treborn, a hotshot university student with a fat goth room-mate and some serious childhood traumas that he has blocked from his memory. These include paedophilia at the hands of his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh's drunken kiddie-porn film-making dad, beatings from her brother, the murder of his dog, the accidental murder of a mother and baby and the unintentional incarceration of one of his friends in a mental home. Fact is, you can't blame him for wanting to forget, but a darker cause of Evan's childhood blackouts lay at the root of his problems. After unexpectedly travelling back in time while reading one of the childhood journals a psychiatrist encouraged him to write in hopes of recovering his memories, Evan discovers he has inherited a curse from his institutionalised father. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that another traumatic episode from Evan's childhood was his father's attempted murder of him. Anyway, after the suicide of his childhood sweetheart, Evan chooses to use his newly-found time-travelling skills to change events in the past in order to improve things in the present. Trouble is Evan never saw that Simpson's episode me and Eric and J. saw...The problem with movies involving time travel is that even the most cursory thought given to their plot-line will uncover enough holes to make a very big fishing net. For example, there's a point in Terminator 2 where the death of a character should result in the Terminator himself never being invented. This is presumably overlooked or ignored by the makers. Personally, I think they willfully disregard such flaws in order to tell the story they want to tell, and the time-travel genre is the only one in which they are allowed to get away with it. Anyway, the trouble with The Butterfly Effect is that its writers never seem to even pause to consider the gaping holes they are leaving in their wake, so caught up are they in the fun they're having creating all these funky alternative futures for their hapless hero. And, man, do they have some futures mapped out for the poor guy: murderer, prison bitch, paraplegic, mental patient. You'd think after a couple of dips Evan would remove his toe from the water, but not our boy – he just dives in even further, causing ripples that create ever-worsening scenarios for him and his small group of friends (curiously, none of Evan's tinkering seems to affect the world in general – apart from his first attempt, which seems to lend a kind of 50s musical feel to contemporary university life). Evan blunders back and forth through time like a pinball, learning nothing as he goes to increasingly desperate lengths to put things right.It has to be said that The Butterfly Effect is undeniably entertaining, I was reasonably absorbed in Evan's fate even as I reflected on the pedestrian script and acting. Amy Smart probably has the best role as the wretched Kayleigh, who travels the entire spectrum from university princess to scar-faced hooker courtesy of Evan, and she gives a decent account for herself. But, considering that she is the emotional focus of Evan's escapades, we are left curiously unconcerned by her ever-changing plight, as we are by the fates of Evan's friends and mother.The version I saw was the UK DVD director's cut which, apparently, has a completely different ending to the cinema version. I can only speculate on how bad the cinema ending was, because the director's preferred ending is so stupendously ill-conceived that it completely overshadows any good work that might have gone before. It was so bad it had me swearing at the screen in disbelief.(And unless you are really, really interested in finding out how amazing every single person who worked on the film was, give the directors' commentary the widest of berth.)",Null,0,3,12 April 2010
No Country for Old Men," Another good one from the Coen brothers
","Major spoilers.The Coens certainly seem to be building up a head of steam as they head into their sixth decade, and looking back through their filmography there's only one film that never really made the cut for me. They're still bang on form here, that's for sure, with a slow-burning crime thriller similar in concept to A Simple Plan, although here there is no sibling rivalry but one simple man against one complex hit-man and a lawman who comes to realise that he is long past his best and far out of his depth.Anton Chigurh is one of those creations that linger in the memory long after the fine details of the film have begun to fade, and is played with unnerving understatement by Javier Bardem. You definitely wouldn't want to make fun of his hairdo, that's for sure. Like Tommy Lee Jones ageing sheriff, Chigurh chooses not to use a conventional weapon, killing most of his victims with a captive bolt pistol that propels a retractable bolt into the head or body of his victim, leaving a fatal wound but few clues as to the killer. In effect, Chigurh is the nearest you can get to a human ghost, killing only those who 'see' him in the course of his duties.Chigurh is hired to retrieve the money from a drug deal gone wrong, and quickly learns that the money has been hijacked by Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a resourceful good ol' boy with a conscience that proves both to be his undoing and the only real weak spot in the film. Of course, had Moss not gone back to the scene of the drugs shootout there would have been no film or, at least, the Coen's would have had to negotiate a more tortuous path to enable both Chigurh and the Mexican gangsters also employed to find the money to track their quarry.With virtually no musical score, the Coen's effectively use silence as an instrument of tension. Where most films would try to ratchet up the tension with music designed to influence the viewer's senses this one simply places a static camera in front of an armed man staring at a seedy hotel door and effortlessly has your nerves twanging. But then the whole film is quiet. Tommy Lee Jones'  who looks as if he has aged 20 years in the past five  ageing sheriff's fear of the forces he is up against and realisation of his inadequacies compared to the heritage which he is trying to live up to creep up on him almost without us or him - realising.The film's conclusion is completely logical and wholly uncompromising in its callous disregard for the traditional happy ending. Everyone ends up damaged or dead  just like in real life  and there are no tidy solutions. There is even a blurring of what is real and what imagined when Ed Tom Bell enters the motel room in which the enterprising Moss was finally gunned down. In many films this deliberate decision to avoid and even frustrate the viewers' attempt to attach rational explanations to all that takes place on screen would prove to be irritating, but with this film the technique is strangely appropriate.",Null,1,4,25 September 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A dreamlike film that's firmly anchored in reality...
","There's an almost dreamlike quality to this film which, given the nature of the story it tells and the disposition of the main characters, perpetually threatens to spill over into the stuff of nightmares. There are no heroes here (although Ford believed he would be considered one) and few people with any redeeming features. The story follows the final few months in the life of James (Brad Pitt) and the curious relationship he developed with Bob Ford (Casey Affleck), the idol-worshipping hanger-on who would eventually become his hero's killer. Because we know the outcome of the story from the outset, and because Pitt plays James as a character resigned to his fate even though he verges on paranoia in his mistrust of those around him, there is a very real sense of inevitability about the tale, as if nobody can escape their fate, which dovetails nicely with the slow, measured unfolding of the tale.Although this film contains all the attributes of its genre, it isn't a conventional western by any means. There's hardly any action, and what little violence it contains is presented almost matter-of-factly, with no concessions made with regard to glamorising the lifestyle and deeds of the subject. The one gunfight in the film takes place in a bedroom, with two men firing at each other from a distance of about three feet and repeatedly missing the target. Cowboys were lousy shots in reality, and legendary incidents (such as the gunfight at the OK Corral) apparently lasted no longer than a matter of seconds. It's refreshing, therefore, to see the de-glamorisation of the myth in this way (the only other westerns I can think of that successfully manage this are Dirty Little Billy and Eastwood's Unforgiven).The acting throughout is first-rate. Pitt eschews pretty-boy looks (he's too old for that now, anyway) in favour of a grizzled, weathered demeanour and a depth and inscrutability that is truly frightening at times. All his gang are terrified of him, and all believe (and, again, accept to a degree) that he will someday try to kill them. Affleck, too is terrific as Ford, something of a creep, a nobody who dreams of being somebody. It would have been easy for the character of Ford to have descended to the level of stooge but, again, the film takes the time to paint an altogether fuller picture of the man  a picture that isn't complete until the last few seconds of the film. Paul Schneider also stands out as Dick Liddil.The assassination scene keeps with this aura of inevitability that pervades the entire film. James, knowing the Ford brothers are plotting against him, removes his guns and turns his back on them both. He sees Ford's reflection aiming a gun at him in the picture frame he is straightening but makes no attempt to avoid its bullet. Its an enigmatic touch, maybe intended to suggest that, for all the painstaking research carried out on the life and times of James, we shall never know the whole truth about his assassination and the events leading up to it.This is a film that can be wholeheartedly recommended to anyone who prefers not to disengage their brain when watching films. Everyone involved here  director, writer, actors, cinematographer  appears to be playing at the top of their game. A film like this is evidence, if it were ever really needed, that Hollywood can still finance and produce films of real and lasting quality.",Null,2,5,18 April 2008
Twilight," How is it possible to make a dull vampire movie?
","There's no doubting that I'm not a member of the intended market for this film (a good thirty years too old, alas) and it's equally true that I'm also of the wrong gender, but the phenomenal success of this film is puzzling to me. It's quite difficult to make an uninteresting film about vampires – although quite a few have succeeded – but this, the first of a franchise, set amongst a high school milieu recognisable to its target demographic, is as dull as the palette director Catherine Hardwicke chooses to paint her picture with.While I like vampire flicks, I don't really like films that play too much with accepted vampire lore. Twilight doesn't so much play with its conventions as totally re-invent them for its own somewhat cynical purposes. Twilight's vampires have no fear of daylight – they just turn a pretty silver colour when exposed to direct sunlight – which means they can interact with humans, go to school, hold down a job – as a doctor, no less; they have no fangs, no fear of water or holy symbols, and they don't feed on the blood of humans, choosing instead to chow down on wild animals. In fact, in many ways they're a typical all-American family: prick your thumb and suck the blood and you'd be as much of a vampire as these guys. (Perhaps I should amend that last sentence to typical dysfunctional All-American family).Of course, this makes the prospect of becoming a vampire a not unappealing one; after all, you get to live forever and, if like the lead vampire here, you get turned in your teens, you get to spend eternity appealing to pretty girls of a similar age. This being aimed at teens, there's a strong identification with the trials of an outsider. The young heroine is the new girl in town whose father is the local cop, and the vampires are outsiders because of who they are. All of which makes them appealing to teenagers who feel the world doesn't understand them and who are subsequently unsure of their place in it.To be fair to the author, it's at least a fairly unique idea, and the Twilight books have clearly struck a chord with young teenagers. The film is reasonably well made, and while it won't make a particularly enjoyable experience for most adults, it at least doesn't cut corners in the belief that it doesn't have to try as hard simply because it's aimed at a less demanding than average target audience.",Null,8,10,7 December 2009
Meet the Fockers," Better than the first film...
","I'm going by my rating for the first Meet the... film when I say this one shades the first in terms of laughs because, to be honest, I remember very little of the initial outing. Maybe I was just in a more receptive mood when I saw this sequel - the humour is undoubtedly of the toilet variety - but I found myself chuckling out loud on a number of occasions while watching this which is something that doesn't happen too often these days.Dustin Hoffman makes the biggest impression with his laid-back hippyish father of the bridegroom, while Robert De Niro plays his familiar rigid stick-in-the-mud. De Niro doesn't come out of their interplay too well here to be honest; Hoffman easily overshadows him and he really looks like he's waiting for knocking-off time for much of the film. Mind you, that could be said for many of his performances these days: his choice of roles has proved fairly dubious since Di Caprio replaced him as Scorsese's favourite actor, and perhaps that's why he so often looks jaded on-screen.Barbra Streisand comes out of screen retirement to play Ben Stiller's sex therapist mother and you have to wonder why. Any number of competent (but less iconic) actresses could have played the role as there isn't really that much screen time - or laughs - given to her.While it might not manage to sustain its pace throughout its slightly over-long running time, Meet the Fokkers proves to be entertaining enough to prevent you from feeling you've been wasting your time.",Null,0,0,2 June 2009
The Number 23," Just about adds up
","Probably the most impressive thing about this film  apart from the fact that Jim Carrey can appear on-screen without being intensely annoying  is the sheer deluge of information regarding the number 23 rather than anything to do with the plot, style or technique. Carrey makes a good job of portraying an average Joe slowly coming unhinged as he identifies a little too closely with the character in a book purchased for him by his wife, especially as he has to overcome a plot which immerses him in 'paranoia' a little too quickly to be comfortably believable.For all the talk about the number 23, the film is more about fate and the way that seemingly insignificant events can have life-changing consequences. Dog-catcher Walter Sparrow resists the unwelcome advances of a work colleague at a Christmas party so, two months later, she spitefully sends him on a job one minute before knocking off which makes him late picking up his wife, who browses in a bookshop while she waits and buys him the book that propels Walter on his devastating journey. It's coincidence disguised as fate, really, but it holds together quite well for the purposes of the story. Writer Fernley Phillips, whose first effort this is, does well to tap into our seeming fascination with numbers (just look at the message boards and trivia section for this flick to see what I mean) and combine it with a paranoid thriller/mystery that just about manages to work.The only major flaw is the way that Philips can only tie up all the loose ends through the use of a lengthy explanation (to both us and Walter) which tends to rudely eject the viewer from the film and back into their seat. The complex plot is all very clever  even though it doesn't quite hold together  but any explanations required should be reserved for the after-movie discussion/reflection rather than the last reel of the movie itself.",Null,1,3,11 January 2008
Ghost Rider," One of those guilty pleasures...
","If ever a film looked like a cert for the thumbs down this is it. Nic Cage, an actor of limited ability with a propensity for wearing ill-fitting wigs, in an effects-heavy adaptation of a lesser-known comic-book character. Early indications gave me no reason to hope for anything better but then, after half-an-hour or so of fairly clunky exposition something strange started to happen: it started to be funMake no bones about it, this isn't a well made film but, like all good films that know that they're bad, it doesn't worry too much about pleasing those looking for polished performances, meaningful dialogue and semiotics. In fact, like a hairy biker gunning his engine, it raises a finger at all those with lofty expectations and goes its own delirious way. This is a film about a skeleton with its head on fire, after all.Cage gives exactly the same performance he has given in every film he has ever made. His syrup sits atop his head like a fat lazy spider dreaming of the time it spied its soul mate perched atop Elton John's dome. Its difficult to be sure whether Cage is trying to play it straight in order to raise laughs or not  perhaps he didn't even know himself. Perhaps director Johnson told him to play it straight knowing it was a sure way of winning laughs. Either way, Cage is at his least irritating here. Eva Mendes doesn't have much to do but looks delicious doing it in a succession of tight-fitting outfits. Peter Fonda makes one of film history's more insipid Satans, while the guy who plays his errant son fares little better. Sam Elliott plays the crusty caretaker of a cemetery who appears to be based on Clint Eastwood's western characters and shares an exhilarating night-time race across the desert with the Ghost Rider to the strains of Ghost Riders in the Sky.This is one of those films that wants you to crack open a beer, kick back, and empty your brain before the opening credits end. Watch it on its own terms and you're sure to have a blast.",Null,4,7,1 July 2008
Hellboy," Hellboy
","Essentially just one in a long line of comic book film adaptations, Hellboy is enlivened by the superb casting of Ron Perlman from the 'I-know-the-face-but-can't-remember-the-name' school of acting as the eponymous hero.Hellboy is the infant product of some Nazis attempt to lure demons through a portal opened by Grigori Rasputin Â– yeah, that Rasputin. Taken under the wing of John Hurt's professor-of-something Bruttenholm, Hellboy grows into a hulking monster with red skin, forked tail and an impressive pair of horns which he grinds down in order to blend in.Introduced as a Loch Ness Monster type focus of media speculation, writer/director Guillermo del Toro quickly discards this aspect of the tale to concentrate on a relatively straightforward supernatural demons type plot that offers nothing new to those familiar with a range of comic book heroes stories (this film is, in fact an amalgamation of three different Hellboy stories). A love story is unwisely shoehorned into the plot, providing a respite from the plethora of special effects, which might have been more welcome had it been of any interest.Perlman is the best thing about this film. For a start, he looks the part, even though he was in his mid-fifties when this was shot. He breaths a little life into a lot of lame one-liners, but the foes with which he is provided are a little too bland at times: Biddy Hodson, the only villain whose character offered the suggestion of a little depth, is woefully underused and the film is all the weaker for it.This one will please the pre-18 multiplex set, but will leave more mature audiences wanting something more substantial.",Null,1,1,13 May 2007
The Incredibles," Living in an ordinary world...
","There are elements of the animation in this film that are quite staggering. The hair and fabric especially look so lifelike that you begin to wonder where it's all going to end. I caught a bit of a Formula 1 race the other day; the camera was located in the driver's cab so that we could see what he saw and my first thought was how much it looked like a video game. Thankfully, the likes of Pixar aren't content to simply amaze its audience with its computer images but also devotes time and care to the storyline of superheroes trying to fit into an ordinary world.The film, although immersed in bright and saturated colours, has a dark undertone that will fly over the heads of the kids at which it is primarily aimed to hit the their adult companions square between the eyes. We're all super-heroes in our own eyes  or we'd all like to be  and our powers are constrained only by the mundane chains of job and mortgage with which we bind ourselves. Couple that with a yearning for the glory days and you have either a recipe for depression or a launch pad for wild fantasy. The film acknowledges the fact that we're all different, but doesn't patronise its audience by pretending we're all special. It's OK to try to be something more than we are, just stay within society's rules and values as you try.The film provides a few belly-laughs too. Worth catching.",Null,0,0,4 August 2008
The Mist," Probably the best adaptation of a King story to date...
","Major Spoilers: Frank Darabont's adaptations of Stephen King stories seem to be as successful as Mick Garris's are pedestrian. Here he departs from the prison movie  although there are plenty of imprisoned characters here  to deliver an intelligently written and presented horror film. This is no stalk-and-slash film. There are no cheap scares, and the judicious use of hand-held cameras lend an immediacy and believability to the fantastic story that unfolds. The film is two hours long, but the time flies and, despite some occasionally suspect special effects, the set-pieces really hold you on the edge of your seat. The creatures here are so fantastic and bizarre, the room for invention and imagination so vast, that you just don't know what horrors are going to befall the unlucky shoppers in the small town supermarket suddenly shrouded in a deadly mist.I read King's novella a long time ago, but it was so entertaining that I still remember it well and, although this film is probably as good an adaptation as it's possible to make, there were a couple of things that didn't quite work for me. Although Marcia Gay Harden is excellent in her role as the religious zealot Mrs Carmody, she is far removed from King's portrayal of the character. If I remember correctly, the character in his novella was old and overweight and wore ugly glasses, while Harden's interpretation is too Hollywood. Give her a makeover and she could dazzle as she sashayed down the red carpet. I think King's idea was that both Mrs Carmody and her outspoken views were mildly grotesque to ordinary people in the 'normal' world, but that grotesqueness is slowly eroded in the minds of her fellow captors as the layers of normality in their world are stripped away by each successive attack from the monsters in the mist.Secondly, the ending doesn't work for me. There is no ending as such in the novella. We leave Drayton and his new family somewhere on the mist-shrouded road, heading for Bangor, Maine, spurred on by the briefest, dimmest snatch of dialogue heard amidst the static coming from their car radio. The twist ending that Darabont manufactures certainly has its momentary shock value, but once that has passed you start wondering why Drayton is so quick to kill off his fellow travellers. I suppose it is near impossible to end the movie the way the novella ends  at least without a narration from Drayton  but it still rankles a little.Despite these relatively minor gripes, this is one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time. There aren't many mainstream Hollywood horror flicks that find time for philosophical debate in the midst of all the carnage, but The Mist manages it without the moment sticking out like a sore thumb. It also offers as much to fear from the people inside the supermarket  and the fickle dangers of human nature under stress  as it does from the monstrosities crashing into the supermarket's plate glass windows",Null,1,2,2 December 2008
Stardust," Entertaining time-filler
","Hurled into the UK public's consciousness late in '07 largely on the basis of the Take That single over the end credits and Jonathan Ross's shameless plugging of wifey's script on his own chat show, Stardust is an enjoyable enough fantasy adventure aimed presumably at the early-teens, which you sense never quite manages to be as magical as it is trying to be.Charlie Cox gets his big break here as Tristan Thorne, a likable young man who crosses the Wall to a mystical land to find a star that will prove his love for the fickle Victoria (Sienna Miller). Cox is amiable enough but is a little too bland or my liking to sustain a career as a leading man. Despite an eye-catching cameo from Robert de Niro as a cross-dressing sky pirate who likes nothing more than slapping on the make-up to dance the can-can when alone in his quarters, it's Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first role for some time, who steals the show as one of a trio of decrepit old witches who are also in pursuit of a star to rejuvenate themselves. This is largely because de Niro bungles his part, seemingly unable to manage the camp feyness he reveals to Tristan but which he conceals behind a bluff macho façade in front of his crew. Ricky Gervaise is also amusing, even though he's pretty much playing David Brent in a pointy hat.The story is entertaining enough, even though it adds nothing new to the genre and bears a strong resemblance to Princess Bride at times. It's the kind of film that will probably delight the kids without boring their parents, even though some of its ideas seem underdeveloped. At times the editing leaves something to be desired with a couple of scenes ending too abruptly and emphasising more adroitly how important rhythm is to a film than any editing masterworks could ever do.Watch it, though, and you'll be entertained even though you may well not bother recommending it to others.",Null,0,0,10 April 2008
Driven," To Despair...
","The Wizard of Oz is more rooted in reality than this piece of garbage from the pen of Sly Stallone. At least aware that he's no longer young enough to play the male lead, he gives himself a supporting role which somehow manages to bag more screen time than the nominal leads – Til Schweiger and some other guy – who play a pair of racing drivers vying for the driving championship of one of those sports that looks suspiciously like Formula One but isn't. Stallone's character is called in as back up to the other guy's challenge. (I can't remember the guy's name, and the blandness of both his features and his performance mean I can't really be bothered to look him up). Anyway, this guy's a from-out-of-the-blue rookie who's suddenly suffering from the wobbles with the finishing line in sight. There's a few women involved, but they're just there to pad out the running time and deflect the possibility of anybody detecting a homoerotic undertone.Renny Harlin's direction is in-your-face flashy, replete with wandering shaky-cam shots, astonishing high-speed prangs that send wheels and stuff hurtling skywards, and two dozen cuts during any thirty-second conversation. He does manage to conjure up a couple of moments of tension, but the impression is that he's adopting all these razzle-dazzle techniques in a futile attempt to divert your attention from the dull plot and asinine script.Ah yes, the script If I wrote this review with the same care and skill as Stallone wrote the screenplay for Driven, it would read something like this: The script was bad. I did not like the script. I wish the script was better because I did not like the script. It made me sad. Why do they make scripts like this? It made me sleepy. Find yourself. A talented cast would have struggled to mine anything of worth from this rubbish but this lot are hardly A-list: A German star speaking his second language, a model turned actress, the aforementioned bland guy whose name I've chosen to forget. Burt Reynolds shows his commitment to bankruptcy by playing the hard-as-nails crippled manager of the racing team from behind the plastic mask that became his face sometime in the mid-1990s – but he at least gets to sit down throughout and has at least a functional acting technique.",Null,1,2,14 October 2011

The once vibrant city is now an eerie wasteland, bereft of all human life (or bodies, come to that) through which Neville trawls with military planning in search of human life. Ironically, once he eventually finds it, his relatively secure - if lonely - existence quickly begins to fall apart.The overall impression I got after watching I Am Legend was that of an opportunity wasted. It's been a long time since I watched The Omega Man, but I recall that that film was also fairly disappointing once the curiosity value of a lone man speeding through lifeless city streets had worn off. Heston's version ill-advisedly strayed into vampire territory, with the viruses victims turning into albino-like creatures unable to come out into the sun but capable of logical thought and communication. Here, the afflicted are little more than feral animals, and in this respect at least, the later version is more believable. But where are the charred and ruined buildings, the car smashes, the looted stores, the putrefying bodies, the rats? Post-apocalyptic NY simply looks like a place from which people have been plucked and some undergrowth added. I only saw this on the small screen, but the vision of this NY didn't really convince, and any attempt at verisimilitude is minimal.Smith is on the screen alone for much of the film with only his faithful German Shepherd for company, and he does quite well. His Robert Neville continues to search for an antidote to the virus, even as its victims try to kill him. Sam, his dog, is his last link with the old world and his family, and the scene in which Neville must kill her to prevent her from becoming completely infected from the virus is strangely affecting. Neville's coping mechanisms are also explored, if only cursorily, but they add some depth to a character that otherwise has very little. He sets up mannequins in the DVD store he regularly frequents (modern technology means the scene in which Heston repeats the words of an interviewee from Woodstock in a deserted auditorium can't be replicated here - the best the writers can come up with is Smith quoting the lines from Shrek as it plays on his DVD ('I like Shrek' he asserts helpfully)) and talks to them as if they're real people, and it these kind of small acts of madness that keep him sane.As others have commented, things fall apart fairly badly in the final third of the picture, when it abandons its study of Neville's trauma in favour of both a more conventional action genre conflict and a quite frankly ludicrous diversion into fellow survivor Anna's (Alice Braga) crackpot belief that god has determined that Neville and she should have met. The film's overblown conclusion even goes pretty much all the way towards confirming her theory with a badly misjudged happy ending that simply refuses to be believable.",Null,2,2,8 May 2008
Gran Torino," The All-American Cranky Pensioner...
","There aren't many near-octogenarians could pull off the role of Walt the way Clint Eastwood does. Let's face it, you see a scene on paper in which a crusty old pensioner is called upon to face down a trio of street-hardened punks intent on raping an Hmong girl who has strayed onto their territory and you're going to far the worst. But, for most of the film, Clint snarls and growls like a p*ssed off old pitbull who might not be too fast on his feet anymore, but who can still cause some damage if you get too close to those old jaws.Walt is the All-American blue collar worker turned old and unwanted. His unappreciative sons stay away because of his curmudgeonly demeanour and want to put him in a 'luxury resort' for the elderly. But Walt is the last vestige of a bygone era when America was for Americans. He flies the flag outside his house and drinks American beer, and he despises his Hmong neighbours, little realising that he has become as marginalised from mainstream society as they are. The subdued teenage son of the Hmong household is bullied into attempting to steal Walt's Gran Torino by his no-good cousin, but Walt catches him in the act. Eventually, of course, he and the boy become close friends.No doubt Gran Torino can be read on many levels, and although I enjoyed the movie immensely I couldn't help feeling that perhaps it was trying to cover too many bases. Like his country, Walt is haunted by the past and unable to shake the prejudices that have shaped him. The world has both expanded and shrunk so that residents of a country in which America once fought a war have now become uneasy neighbours. Walt's an isolationist – he wants to be left alone – but circumstances and the threat of invasion of his property make this impossible. The predatory elements within this new community need to be hived off and dealt with. So far, so straightforward, but lurking in the background is a baby-faced priest offering redemption through a church that Walt has forsaken – but to whom his recently deceased wife remained strong. And, for me, this ill-judged sub-plot of the film weakened it considerably. It was almost as if the scriptwriter had found a few pages from an old Pat O'Brien movie that he had fallen in love with and just had to include in the film. This is the 21st Century, and an objective appraisal of the situation leaves little room for religion, no matter whether the tale your telling is allegorical, metaphorical, or simply to be enjoyed on a passive level.",Null,0,4,6 February 2010
La Grande Illusion," Classic Anti-War Movie
","Spoilers.Films like La Grande illusion have a lot to live up to. Widely acknowledged as a timeless classic, it's approached by the first-time viewer with a high level of expectation. As I watched the first twenty minutes or so I began to doubt the opinions of those who profess to know about such things. The forced, broad humour of the prisoners of war was off-putting and out of place. The comical yet annoying little French man who nearly suffocates in a tunnel would no doubt have received a few clouts within days of arriving at the camp if he lived in the real world instead of enjoying the tolerant good humour of his fellow prisoners.But once the prisoners are separated and moved on (on the very day they plan to leave by the tunnel they have been digging for months) and the film concentrates more on the working class Marechal (Jean Gabin) and aristocratic Bourdieu, it seems to find itself. The war has displaced these prisoners – they play childish games as they watch children training to be soldiers – and the film almost seems to be taking them through a new life, one which they must grow and mature into. They play foolish pranks, dress up in costumes, undergo a kind of homo-erotic bonding as they observe how women's hair has grown so short that it is like sleeping with a boy – before all conversation and activity is stopped by the sight of a young comrade wandering around in women's clothing he has acquired for a stage show.Marechal and Bourdieu are sent to a castle prison presided over by a German officer they have encountered before. The officer is played by Erich von Stroheim, and, in an understated performance, he speaks his lines with care. He too is a casualty of war, no longer able to fly because of injuries to his spine which leave him with his neck in a permanent brace. His character identifies with the aristocratic Bourdieu: they know the same people, and have possibly slept with the same woman. It's at this point that class distinction comes to the fore. Renoir emphasises the differences in class to illustrate the fact that, while we may not all be the same, war influences all our lives. 'The rich and noble glorify death in service,' one of the officers opines, 'but for the lower classes it's a tragedy.' Marechal and Rosenthal, a Jewish prisoner, escape from the castle and are offered refuge by a German widow. The German, the Jew and the Frenchman live in harmony, enjoying a blissful Christmas together. All the men in her life – her husband and brothers – have been taken by the war, all of them killed in battles that were great victories for Germany. By now the film has dropped all pretence of humour and reaches – mostly successfully – for something more profound. War inevitably separates this happy trinity (plus cute child), and Marechal's departure, without tears or overt sentiment, is almost devastating in its subtlety and grace.By the time the film was over the near two-hour running time had passed in a blur. Our heroes make it safely to Switzerland, but Renoir is careful to avoid any hint of triumph; we see only two tiny figures trudging through the snow, watched by a troop of German soldiers who refrain from firing because their quarry has passed a border that Rosenthal has earlier declared to be meaningless. 'Borders are man-made,' he says, 'Nature couldn't care less.'",Null,1,1,11 February 2010
The Illusionist," Expect the 'expected' unexpected.
","Any film with a title like this is bound to have a sting in its tail, and the sting here isn't going to cause anyone much pain: in fact it's one of those unexpected twists we've pretty much come to expect. The ever dependable Paul Giamatti is the best thing in the film as the morally dubious chief of police, living in the pocket of the half-mad Crown Prince but still near enough to the streets to identify with Edward Norton's master illusionist. Norton is good, but he's a little difficult to swallow in a period piece, and his European accent is a little suspect at times. The reveal, when it comes, is a little sketchy  especially about Eisenheim's powers of resurrection, but it doesn't really spoil the film that much. I'm quite surprised at its high rating, though.",Null,0,0,21 October 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Kismet.
","I don't have a problem with long, leisurely-paced films as long as they are intelligently written and directed, so for me The Curious of Benjamin Button, while perhaps not quite managing to achieve the greatness for which it quite obviously strives, was an enjoyable film. That isn't to damn the film with faint praise - lofty ambitions unrealised aren't necessarily a sign of a sub-standard film. But my only real criticism is that Button is a film that dwells on questions of fate and life and death without really providing any meaningful insight. The central device, that of the title character (ably played by Brad Pitt) ageing backwards almost seems to be superfluous. His condition is accepted unquestioningly by all around him, and as the film focuses more on the first half of Button's life there is little evidence of the wisdom living one's life in reverse would give Button as his looks grow younger.The story is told on a fairly grand scale while focusing on the importance of human relations (and how they mould a person) and the emotions that play a part in deciding our fate. A melancholic air hangs over everything: we know that Benjamin can only briefly sample happiness because of his condition: his affair with Daisy can only ever be a transient one, a fact they both try to ignore and which Benjamin finally, reluctantly, faces up to. It's at this point that the effects of Benjamin's condition (rather than the emotional impact) take centre-stage. By now the film is over two-hours old, leaving it feeling somewhat imbalanced as the last thirty-odd years of Benjamin's life feel glossed over. Despite this, the poignancy of his final years is perfectly captured.It's long, it's slow, there's a certain sense of self-importance about it, but The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is definitely worth a look.",Null,0,2,9 January 2010
Saw II," This is no hack Saw
","MAJOR SPOILERS This flick isn't bad for a sequel. It kicks off with a hell of a bang that, unfortunately (and inevitably) the rest of the film can't live up to, but it still manages to keep you interested in the storyline that is unfolding. There is an element of more of the same about it  but then that's why sequels are made  but there are just about enough fresh developments  and an unexpected (by me at least) twist that is worth waiting for. For my money, the only major drawback is the way some of the characters behave: why did Xavier feel he has to kill everybody in order to discover the number tattooed on the back of their neck? And would that girl, having spent 2 hours in a booby-trapped house, really have been so stupid as to plunge her hands into that glass box to retrieve the antidote (especially when the box is secured by a padlock with the key still in it). It made for an effective moment, but it didn't make a lot of sense. Pretty good film though, an equal to its predecessor, that's for sure.",Null,0,0,18 September 2007
Paranormal Activity," The mouths were wrong...
","For the life of me I can't understand how this film generated such good word of mouth. No doubt if the stuff that happens in this film happened to you in real life you'd be scared witless. Doors open and close in the middle of the night, loud bangs disturb the peace in the dead of night, hapless victims are dragged by their ankle from their bed as they sleep – it would be enough to drive you crazy with fear. Trouble is, when you transfer all this to the big screen and use Blair Witch-style home video recordings to show it all, it all comes across as a little 'so'what?' It doesn't help that Micah, the boyfriend of Katie, the girl with her own demonic stalker, is the kind of smug idiot who films himself strumming the guitar and seems intent on irritating whatever it is that his girlfriend has bought into the house at every opportunity. He films everything, and ignores her repeated and increasingly short-tempered pleas to switch the damn thing off, and he prolongs arguments by refusing to answer questions with answers. Together, they're the kind of couple you might enjoy seeing once or twice a year, but any more and you'd really start looking for ways to avoid them, regardless of whether their demon was in tow. Add to the fact that they refuse to take the obvious steps any normal person would take, and you end up being too irritated with them to care what fate awaits. I know if the demonologist the ghost guy had recommended couldn't make it the first thing I'd do is rustle up a small army of parapsychologists (or whatever those crackpots are called) on the basic principle that there's safety (and comfort) in numbers. I'd phone the local TV station too, and the local papers. But these two bozos seem to be cocooned in a world of their own and choose to simply tough it out alone when the demon guy is out of town for a couple of days.On the plus side, the film's well-made on a tiny budget, and the two leads perform well, but that's about all it's got going for it. When the film finished the audience in the cinema remained rooted in their seats, not because they were terrified or stunned by what they had seen, but because they weren't quite sure whether the film was actually over or not. It's the only time I've ever known an entire audience (although it was pretty small, admittedly) sit through the credits and the minute or so of blank screen that followed waiting for some after-credits clip to somehow make it all worth while. Only when the lights came on and we all blinked at each other with a kind of bemused disbelief that we'd actually sat through the entire film did we begin to file dejectedly from the theatre.",Null,2,3,18 December 2009
Blood Diamond," 'Dey've god a leedle problem 'ere, huh?'
","There's no 'may' about it...Edward Zwick's social conscience message-movie, while written with intelligence (for a mainstream Hollywood pic), lacks the necessary insight to be an unqualified success. Like many writers faced with a big important subject, Charles Leavitt struggles to find believable (or interesting) characters through which he can tell the tale. Instead, he comes up with a cast that are familiar to us all  the amoral adventurer, ripe for redemption; the crusading journalist (who also just happens to be a gutsy, strong-willed woman), a noble native everyman, a villainous diamond smuggler  all of whom are way too simplistic in their representative roles.As always, Leonardo Di Caprio delivers an admirable performance, even if he does lay on the 'Saird Efriken' accent a bit thick, although, for my money, he was too convincing in his amoral stage to make his eventual redemption believable. And how heroic is that self-sacrificing redemption? It's always good to see Hollywood straying from its tendency for happy endings, but Danny Archer's decision to die on a hillside rather than try to save himself ('Oi've god a leedle problem 'ere, huh?') really doesn't ring true.At its surface level the film makes for passable action-adventure entertainment, despite (or maybe because of) the stock characterisation, and is a bit of a throwback to the Hollywood adventures of the 50s. But burden all those explosions and killings with a cumbersome message that comes across as a little too preachy at times and the whole thing gets a little weighed down by its own importance.",Null,1,3,6 February 2008
Taken," For Paunchy Fathers Everywhere...
","This is one of those films you enjoy even though you know it's slick and glossy and totally dumb. It contains nothing original, has trite dialogue, an indefensibly heavy dependence on coincidence and luck, narrative signposts that a visually impaired simpleton wearing a blindfold could read in the middle of a blackout, and super-heroic antics from an ageing leading man that in reality would have him reaching for a comfy chair for a sit down within five minutes of the chase beginning. And yet the film's action sequences are so well-staged that they somehow manage to hold it all together and stop you from reaching for the stop button on your remote.Liam Neeson plays a prematurely retired government agent. He's one of those amiable but secretive men who never tell their family what it is that he really does, choosing instead to lend himself an air of mystery by explaining that he was a 'preventer,' i.e. someone who prevented bad things from happening. He tells this to his virginal teen daughter which is when you first suspect that the writer isn't just aiming for the usual 17-24 demographic here but is also reaching out to every pot-bellied, slouch-shouldered, balding middle-aged dad who has seen their life pass them by but who console themselves with the fact that they've at least raised some reasonably decent kids (even though they feel totally alienated from them and probably don't know where they are or what they're doing 85% of the time).Anyway, against his better judgment, Liam allows his daughter to go on a holiday to Paris with her best friend and, wouldn't you know it, they go and get themselves kidnapped by a gang of Albanians. Typical. You let them out of your sight for five minutes. At least that's one good thing about the dispensing of barriers in Europe: us Brits, so long the villainous figure of Hollywood flicks, have now been usurped by the East European.Neeson calls on his security pals for help and, using only a few seconds of taped conversation, a small piece of string and an empty Fairy Liquid bottle, they are able to identify not only the ring leader of the gang but where he used to live. Personally, I'd have shelled out for mates like that to come with me to Paris, but Liam's made of sterner stuff and flies out on his own. And within something like two-and-a-half minutes of arriving in Paris he's on the trail of the young dude who groomed the girls for abduction.OK, so this film isn't really to be taken seriously, even though it doesn't really seem to have much of a sense of humour about itself. Like most films of this genre, if there is any obstacle to the logic or progression of the story it is either ignored completely or summarily dispensed with through the use of a throwaway line. That's why nobody thinks to tell the parents of the second girl that their little precious has just become a statistic in the human trafficking/sexual slavery figures. And it's why nobody in Paris has noticed that lithe young female tourists to the city are regularly disappearing within hours of getting off their planes. It's why Neeson has no trouble making himself understood in a foreign country, and why every Albanian gangster in Paris has an excellent grasp and command of the English language. It's why Neeson can identify his daughter's spotter through a hazy reflection of him taking her photograph on her mobile phone. And it's why a drunken and drugged girl can remember the name of the street in which she was imprisoned as her captors turn her into a junkie ready to turn onto the streets.And the reason I highlight all these weaknesses, inconsistencies and flaws of the film isn't so much to damn it as to emphasise how surprising it is that I managed to enjoy so much of what was going on. The action scenes are the kind of highly-charged, adrenaline-pumping set-pieces that sometimes have you forgetting to breath, and the makers are canny enough to know that this is where the real strength of the film lies. Because when you strip the story down to its bare essentials – innocent young heroine plucked from the warmth and security of her family to become the plaything of a wealthy but villainous sheik – you're talking about a plot that was old in the 1920s. And Liam Neeson's hair-raising escapades and last-minute escapes are straight out of those old boys-own serials of the 30s.",Null,1,3,9 September 2009

Up," Squirrel!
","Films like Up, with computer-generated animation that captures every tiny human gesture and expression while still presenting a parody of the face and body, are so far removed from traditional animation that they might as well be given a genre of their own. That's not intended to denigrate the work of the likes of Pixar, but simply to point out that what we have here isn't so much another form of animation as another form of non-human images. Where Up! loses the kind of warmth human animators were capable of drawing into their characters, it redeems itself by delivering an emotionally-anchored tale of adventure that relies heavily on it's lead character's melancholy state of mind to keep the audience on board. To this end, Up! is more of an adult's film with elements added to keep the kids entertained rather than the other way around, which is usually the case with films like this.Ed Asner voices the character of Carl Friedrickson, a lonely old man who misses the recently deceased wife he has been with since childhood. He also regrets that they never managed to embark on the kind of adventures they dreamed about when watching newsreel of famous explorer Charles Muntz. All this is shown in an opening vignette that will nail the viewer's backside to their seat more firmly than an entire tub of superglue. Threatened with eviction to an old people's home, Carl decides to launch his house into the sky with the help of 20,000 helium-filled balloons and drift away to Paradise Falls in South America, which was the dream destination of his late wife. Things don't go quite to plan when Carl discovers he has a stowaway on board in the rotund form of Russell, some kind of wildlife ranger who just needs his 'Help the Elderly' badge to become a senior wildlife ranger.Beneath the adventure is the rather less exciting message that it's OK to live a life of ordinariness and routine, and that a life lived with the right person is a journey and adventure in itself (Not quite sure I'm inclined to agree when I'm stuck in a five mile traffic jam on the A428 or washing the dishes, but I'll let that one go). As Russell says, with an innocent insight that belies his youth, it's the small stuff you miss when it's no longer available to you, like sitting on the kerb with your dad, eating ice cream and counting red and blue cars.The film looks incredible, almost to the point that you're drawn away from the story at times to gawp at the growing stubble on the old guy's chin, or the fur on the talking dogs that form the old and embittered Muntz's guard. It isn't really intended to be an out-and-out comedy – it certainly isn't simply out to get as many laughs as it can – but there are a few laugh-out-loud moments and a refreshing lack of sentimentality despite it's essentially emotive subject matter. Definitely worth an hour-and-a-half of anybody's time.",Null,0,0,24 March 2010
From Hell," Average
","Despite playing fairly free and easy with the facts of the Jack the Ripper case, Albert and Allen Hughes still manage to fashion a fairly ordinary tale out of a compelling murder case. Johnny Depp is the laudanum-addicted police detective assigned to uncover the killer of prostitutes in London's Whitechapel area. Depp, exercising his almost-there-but-not-quite English accent, has clairvoyant dreams that help him not one jot in solving the mystery, but which offer the directors the chance to insert some edgy editing.The film looks good, but is too long and sometimes your attention wanders as the good inspector wanders into an improbable emotional involvement with the prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather Graham, with an accent even wonkier than Depp's). Its solution to the mystery is just about plausible, and skirts around the possible true involvement of a member of royalty, but for some reason the Hughes brothers provide an ambiguous coda that leaves the impression that it all may just be the dream of a dying man. It's a strange choice, a bizarre perversion of the 'he woke up to discover it was all a dream' cliché that fails to work",Null,2,5,8 August 2007
Limitless," Don't think too hard about it...
","Eddie Morra is a slacker would-be author with writer's block whose life is slowly falling apart when he runs into his ex-brother-in-law who turns him onto a wonder pill that not only allows its user to harness all the unused potential of their brain, but turns their eyes a vivid, piercing shade of blue. Before you know it, Eddie's using his new hyper-intelligence and baby-blues to make a killing on the stock market and bed various women. He tidies his apartment, services his landlady, writes a book in four days, and gets back with the girlfriend who dumped him moments before his life changed forever. What, you wonder, could ever go wrong? Limitless is the kind of thriller that could just as easily have been a feel-good comedy and, while it's enjoyable enough, the number of plot inconsistencies and loose ends which plague it are nothing short of shocking. Some examples: Eddie awakes late one morning after an 18-hour blackout caused by his reckless use of the drug. He's due to deliver a career-making presentation to whizz-bang Wall Street financier Van Loon (an agreeably shady Robert De Niro) that very morning but discovers he has no more pills at his flat. There are some stashed in his newly-reinstated girlfriend's place, but instead of dashing over there for some, Eddie decides to try and wing it. Really? I don't think so. After all, this is presumably what that big unexplained plan he had when jumping off a cliff was. Even the ordinarily densest of characters would realise they had no chance of blagging such a deal. Another example: the creators of the drug, their reasons for creating it, and their business plan to make a profit from it, are never explained. Presumably they're producing it to make a profit, and yet one mega-rich tycoon (a minor character we never meet) expires within days because he runs out. Instead of going to a source for more, he despatches a goon to follow Eddie for most of the film but this guy does nothing to try and relieve Eddie of his own stash. I could describe another two or three points without having to think too hard, but to do so would probably give a misleading impression about the overall merits of the film.Limitless isn't as entertaining (or as smart) as it could have been. A little more effort in the writing department would have resulted in a story that complemented the keen direction and breakneck pace that makes the film's running time fly. One positive aspect about the writing is that, by having Eddie remain an essentially good guy through to the end credits, it avoids the obvious character arc of turning him into some unrecognisable power-crazed megalomaniac who must lose touch with his real self in order to learn what's important in life.",Null,0,0,25 August 2011

The Happening," This is Not Good.
","The budgets are starting to get a little small for M. Night Shyalaman, once briefly Hollywood's blue-eyed boy, and the casts are now plucked from the B-list instead of the top shelf. Judging by this incredibly daft mess, it's my guess that those budgets are going to keep getting thinner and that even the B-listers will stop returning his calls before long.The plot concerns a mysterious virus that strikes New York's Central Park one morning. The virus strikes suddenly, making its victim's disorientated and incapable of speech before eventually developing suicidal tendencies. The opening scene , in which construction workers rain from the sky, is probably the best of the film because, as the reasons for the virus are slowly explained the film grows increasingly silly.Mark Wahlberg plays one of the frightened city dwellers evacuating the city for the countryside - which proves to be a big mistake; they should have headed for a city centre Starbucks - with his wife and best friend plus daughter. John Lequizamo plays the friend, and he's almost completely wasted as well as miscast. The refugees find themselves stranded in a small town after the train they are travelling on is halted when it loses communications. All the passengers wind up in the town's diner and, when the TV informs them that they have actually ventured into the virus's epicentre, climb into convenient cars to make their second escape. Only Wahlberg and his gang failed to have the foresight to ensure they had a car waiting at the diner for when the unforeseen train stop occurred It's this kind of sloppy writing that really winds me up. It smacks of a 'that'll do' attitude on the part of the writer that is an insult to the film's audience. Either Shyamalan figures we're not bright enough to spot glaring flaws like this or he just doesn't care whether we notice or not. It's only a small moment, but flaws like that rankle for the duration of the film.The film grows increasingly silly - with some ill-advised and ham-fisted efforts at humour along the way - so that, despite the brief running time, the audience stops caring what happens - or why it happens - long before the end credits finally roll.",Null,3,6,30 August 2009
Zombieland," Feelgood Zombie Flick
","This movie is an amiable, if rather aimless attempt to create a feelgood zombie flick. In order to achieve this it pretty much ignores what we can imagine to be the realities of such a situation in its attempt to raise a few laughs and amuse us with its irreverent attitude towards what used to be a serious horror sub-genre. The fact is, the zombie comedy-horror genre is becoming as over-populated as the straight version from which it was spawned, and Zombieland doesn't really add anything new to the mix.Having said that, it's entertaining enough if you're in an undemanding mood. Woody Harrelson goes all Mallory-lite for his portrayal of Tallahassie, and although he's never convinced me as a tough guy, he's good enough. The lead character's rules for survival in zombieland are possibly the most entertaining part of the film, and it's a shame we're only let in on 10 or so of the 30+ he's devised.For all it's entertainment value, you can't help feeling it could have been a whole lot more – which suggests its writers have perhaps devoted too much time paying affectionate homage to other movies they admire rather than creating something worthy of their own to which others might wish to pay homage.",Null,1,1,29 March 2010
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," The Family That Slays Together Stays Together
","Mr & Mrs Smith is a typical Hollywood summer blockbuster that relies more on the star qualities of its leads than on any attempt at a logical involving storyline or depth of characterisation. Not so much sidestepping as completely ignoring the myriad number of difficulties a pair of married assassins would have concealing their professions from one another, the film quickly establishes that Mr (Brad Pitt) and Mrs (Angelina Jolie) Smith's marriage is submerged deep within the doldrums through one of two straight-to-camera counselling sessions that bookend the tale. Of course, their ignorance of their shared profession is what is killing off their marriage, thus reinforcing the jokey old adage about the family that slays together stays together.The film's saving grace is that, by placing itself squarely in a world in which the couple work for blatantly ridiculous killing corporations, it refuses to take itself seriously. This is a mix of James Bond gadgetry and Mission Impossible missions, and on this superficial and unchallenging level it works well, and the manner in which the couple are situated within a recognisably normal suburban environment is cute. However, if it's an engaging story or an involving world in which you wish to immerse yourself then you're better off passing this one by. At more than two-hours its way too long, and its tenuous link with reality is broken completely for a final-reel denouement that is as forced as it is farcical.",Null,0,4,12 November 2007
Die Hard," A Classic
","Die Hard is the film that re-wrote the action genre, sparked countless copycat flicks (all of them inferior) and signalled the beginning of the slow, terminal decline of the careers of Messrs Schwarzenegger and Stallone (and the somewhat faster dive into obscurity of the likes of van Damme, Dudikoff, etc). The film holds up surprisingly well, despite all those copies. It should be showing its age, but it doesn't, and the subtext of average working joe threatened by  and fighting back against  faceless multinational corporations (legal or otherwise) is still relevant today. Looking through the principal players, the fact that neither the director, the writer or the star has since achieved such giddy heights suggests that this film was one of those fortunate accidents: everything clicked, and we were somehow given a classic in a genre that throws up precious few. This is the kind of film that's easy to dip into  but nearly impossible to tear yourself away from once you have.",Null,1,1,8 October 2007

The Holiday," Romance was never so commercially orientated...
","OK, let's get the gripes out of the way first: Vaio, Google, Telegraph - product placement has rarely been so shamelessly placed in your face as it is in this romantic comedy that would have you believe it is a throwback to all those romantic comedies from the vintage years of Hollywood. Second gripe - Cary Grant was born in Bristol, a city in the county of Avon, some distance from the county of Surrey.The good things about this movie are that Kate Winslet, as always, is a hugely likable character (it's just a shame she felt the need to slim down about ten years ago); the sub-plot involving Eli Wallach's ageing scriptwriter, which is easily the most interesting strand of the film; and the fact that Jack Black is only 90% as annoying as he usually is and Jude Law acquits himself quite well as the romantic lead.Women will probably love this film; it's unashamedly, unrealistically romantic with a happy ending. Men will probably hate it - there's not an explosion or fist-fight in sight...",Null,0,1,27 December 2009
Wedding Crashers," A Crashing Bore...
","Wedding Crashers' storyline immediately tells you that what you are about to see isn't going to touch the heights of sophistication - it's a film about guys who crash weddings in order to get off with any hot chicks that might be available - so only the most naive of viewers would expect anything other than a lowbrow farce filled with its share of crude and sexist jokes. On this score, Wedding Crashers delivers everything you expect from it - but on all other counts it fails miserably.The chief aim of any comedy, however, is to make its audience laugh, and any comedy that fails to do so must ultimately be considered a total failure. This film barely raised a smile. It never even came close to creating any genuine laughter - just an occasional bemused smile when it rehashed some lame gag that was only mildly funny when it first appeared in Porky's or Pinball Summer or some other eighties teen sex-pic. There's no two ways about it - this film stinks. The only thing it has going for it is a small measure of chemistry between its two male stars and the fact that it is technically competent.Its bad points are many. The plot is entirely predictable and a good thirty minutes too long. The male leads are unsympathetic boors completely undeserving of any audience goodwill, even after their respective moments of so-called redemption, while the females they end up with are badly written and completely unbelievable. Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour are completely wasted in hopelessly underwritten roles, while other characters simply flit in and out of the action with such inconsistency that you get the impression that large amounts of their screen time was sacrificed to the editor's scissors in an attempt to shorten the running time.Bottom line: a big, lumbering mess that should be avoided by anyone with a fully-developed sense of humour.",Null,4,7,3 July 2006
Man on Fire," 'Wrecked 'im? Blew 'im to pieces, Miss'
","Denzel Washington is a fine actor but, for me, he's at his weakest when playing villains (American Gangster), or troubled, moody men as he does here. That's not to say he doesn't give a good performance, but he wouldn't have been my choice for the part of John Creasey, a disillusioned, borderline alcoholic former agent who takes a job as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy young Mexican man and his American wife. The Mexican guy isn't as wealthy as many people believe, which is why he employs Creasey, a choice he comes to regret when little Pita (Dakota Fanning) is predictably kidnapped.Man on Fire isn't exactly a forthcoming film, releasing information to the viewer on a strictly need-to-know basis (if that). As far as I'm aware, we never find out how Creasey came by the wounds on the back of his hand that Scott's cameraman seems so fascinated by, nor much about why he is so troubled in the film's early stages. It's almost as if a whole chunk of back story has been unceremoniously dumped in an attempt to trim down a running time which, at nearly two-and-a-half-hours, is still twenty minutes too long.Creasey develops a close relationship with his precocious little charge (Fanning's character is eight-going-on-forty-five) which is over-played a little immediately before her abduction, and he is overcome with a murderous desire for vengeance when he awakens from a coma to discover the handover of the ransom money was botched and she has been murdered. Before you can say 'superhero' Creasey is ignoring the two bullet wounds he has recently suffered and running around Mexico City knocking off members of the shadowy organisation he discovers are responsible for her death.This is an entertaining enough film, and the plot holes aren't too irritating, even though one of the twists is fairly predictable. I was definitely entertained as I watched, and the lengthy running time only started to tell in the last reel as the film seemed to struggle to tie up all its loose ends. Scott's edgy style of direction works very well at some points but smacks of 'look at me' self-satisfaction at other times and, as is so often the case, the flashy direction merely serves to distance the viewer from the story as we focus on all the jigging about the picture is doing (when I was a kid we'd have had the TV repairman out to some of the stuff that's going on here.) The story itself becomes less of a study of one man's slow descent into self-destruction (which isn't really that interesting anyway) and more of a straightforward action-revenge movie following Creasey's emergence from his coma – which is probably when most of the target audience will perk up.Creasey's methods of execution are certainly imaginative: I'm pretty sure that never before in the history of cinema has a character suffered death by 'bum bomb' before so Man on Fire can give itself a little 'pat' on the back for that one, although personally I can't imagine any injustice great enough to compel me to consider going anywhere near another man's bottom to seek revenge. I've got to admit that, for one mad moment, I did think that was going to be the movie's final twist, judging by how gingerly Denzel hobbled over that bridge to meet his fate, but thankfully it wasn't to be.",Null,0,0,12 September 2009
The Last King of Scotland," A tale of seduction let down by a poor final third
","With its 'inspired by true events' rider, The Last King of Scotland tries to persuade the casual viewer that is a true story when it is really just a fictional flight of fancy built around the dangerous but charismatic Ugandan despot Idi Amin. While the story eventually descends into trite melodrama, what comes before gives a reasonably believable depiction of how it must feel to be trapped in a country where human rights count for little, and human life is easily dispensable, even though the subject matter could just as easily have been the seductive allure of crime or drugs.While James McAvoy gives a decent portrayal of an arrogant young man whose mistaken assumption that he is untouchable belies the youthful impulses that drive him, he would always have been overshadowed by the role of Amin, regardless of who played him, and even had his shallow role not been so poorly developed. As it is, it's doubtful whether the producers could have made a better choice than Forest Whitaker, both physically and performance-wise. Whitaker seems to effortlessly capture the essence of Amin: a cheeky bear of a man, all toothy smile and gleaming eyes, hiding a brooding paranoid who is liable to burst through the cuddly façade at any moment. It's a role that could easily have toppled over into broad parody in less capable hands, but Whitaker is admirable restrained and never allows himself to be swept away by the role.It is probably the relationship between Garrigan, McAvoy's callow young doctor, and the bloodthirsty dictator that is the film's strength and, given Garrigan's brash disdain for those who are of no use to him, there is a certain guilty pleasure to be derived from his eventual downfall. And that is probably the film's weakness  given that a certain naivety is required on the doctor's part, the film goes too far, failing to pull back and allow the viewer to develop some sympathy for him.",Null,1,3,14 January 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Cinematic junk food
","Judging from the state (and unaccountable success)of this movie, it seems that audience standards are declining as the spoof comedy becomes increasingly difficult for Hollywood filmmakers to successfully pull off without blundering into juvenile crassness. One condition is probably a result of the other - although which came first is open to conjecture - and, considering the film's success, it seems as if it will be a long time before things are turned around.Anchorman 'satirises' US TV of the 70s with a deftness of touch as subtle as Will Ferrell's wig and a vast appetite for laughs that it never comes close to satisfying. This is cinematic junk food: too bland, too homogeneous and too lacking in substance to offer any real nourishment, and simply offering a quick fix to those who don't care what they ingest just as long as it offers them a few moments of escape. Too often, while watching this flick, you get the feeling that the writers are just throwing every idea they have - good, bad or indifferent - at the screen in the hope that someone somewhere will find it amusing. Hit and miss comparisons are redundant here because the hits don't exist. Even the moments that should work don't because the makers overplay their hand each time they come close to hitting on a funny idea.On this evidence, Will Ferrell is a better comedy actor than he is a comedy writer, and only his clever performance salvages anything from the untidy wreckage of this collision of scenes. Christina Applegate looks good but contributes little while Ferrell's sidekicks are mostly just irritating. Nothing meshes here: the plot is repeatedly sacrificed in favour of another weak gag; touched with inspired insanity, plot doesn't matter - the humour is enough to carry the viewer - but here the weakness of the material simply serves as a constant reminder that nothing is happening - and its not happening in a very unfunny way.Even the out-takes aren't funny.",Null,0,1,20 March 2006
American Gangster," Good, but not as brilliant as some would have us believe...
","Ridley Scott's crime opus is a real slow-burner that starts a little shakily as it struggles to introduce the central characters in a way that doesn't confuse the viewer, and proceeds to tell its epic story at a stately pace that defies both genre conventions and present-day trends. There is no doubting the quality of the product here, there's no doubting the fact that it is a relatively big and important film, and yet there's still that nagging feeling that it isn't really as good as it could have been Denzel Washington wins more screen time than co-star Russell Crowe and quite frankly acts Crowe off the screen. Ten years in the States and Crowe still has trouble concealing that antipodean twang when he's playing an American. While Crowe fights against his accent, Washington fights against his nice guy persona. Presumably he was chosen for this role because of that charisma  it adds depth to a bad guy when he's also a nice guy  but for some reason he just doesn't convince as this urbane businessman capable of shocking acts of brutality; his dark side simply fails to convince, and his violent outbursts too often seem too much at odds with his usual calm demeanour.Despite these niggles, as you would expect , the film is extremely well made. Scott could make a decent film out of the shoddiest of material, and with a cast like this one you just know you're in for some quality performances. Certainly, the acting and visual style outshine the plot which  despite being based on true events  is straight out of the Warner Bros. Big Book of Gangster Stories © 1937. We are never in any doubt as to how the film will end, and it is to Scott's and writer Steven Zaillian's credit that we're still willing to stick with it to the end credits anyway.",Null,2,4,7 April 2008
The Wrestler," Aronofsky seems to be suggesting that professional wrestling is staged...
","Mickey Rourke delivers a performance here that will mark his place in movie history – something that nobody would have predicted a few years back when his career was on the skids and his pretty-boy looks had been battered beyond recognition by his time as a professional boxer. Thank God the studio relented and allowed director Aronofsky to use Rourke instead of their preferred choice of Nic Cage (Nic Cage – can you imagine it? What a mess he would have made of the part.) The parallels between Randy 'The Ram' Robinson and Rourke are obvious and well-documented, and Rourke must have felt he was born to play the role the moment he first read the script. Marisa Tomei, as the ageing stripper with whom he begins a tentative relationship also gives a notable performance.The story is nothing new, and the characters have been seen before in countless movies, but it isn't the story that's the thing here but the depth of the characterisation and the verisimilitude. Robinson is a man who time has passed by, still living off glory days that have long gone. Twenty years past his prime, he lives in a trailer park, drives a beat up van, frequents seedy strip clubs and fights in town halls and run-down social clubs. The wrestling circuit is the only world he is comfortable with because it's the one that has fashioned him and it is the one in which he earns the respect of his peers. In the real world, even though he's a nice, gentle guy, he is awkward and out of place. His boss looks down on him, and he is most comfortable with kids who like him for who he is. But the world Robinson prefers is a sham, a pantomime for which he dies his hair, fakes his tan and pumps his body full of steroids, and in some respects it is similar to the spurious glamour of Pam/Cassidy's job. The pair of them are both past their prime, but while Cassidy realises the fact and begins to make attempts to escape the life of a stripper, Robinson finds himself drawn back to the comfort of the world of wrestling after a heart attack forces his unplanned retirement.The sub-plot regarding Robinson's relationship with his estranged daughter, like all other aspects of the plot, is very ordinary on paper, but it elicits some remarkable performances from Evan Rachel Wood and Rourke in their scenes together.Aronofsky leaves the final scene open. Robinson might be leaping to his death or to one last victory. Either way, it's fairly certain he won't return to the ring.",Null,0,1,4 August 2009
Hancock," Good Job
","It was wholly predictable that this Will Smith film would receive mixed reviews upon its release last year. It's a film that is impossible to pigeonhole – in terms of both genre and mood – which is something critics and many filmgoers don't like. If you're going to make a film about superheroes, their reasoning goes, then you must fill the screen with daring exploits, comic book villains, and world-in-peril scenarios. The superhero must be the good guy throughout, and the PR guy – no matter what the genre – must always, always be bad.Here we have an unshaven, drunken superhero who saves people in peril while possessing no real interest or true desire to help (in fact, given his disinterest and the public's lack of appreciation, it's difficult to understand why he bothers at all). He regularly screws things up, hurling a beached whale out to sea where it crashes onto a boat, and causing millions of dollars worth of damage every time he performs an act of bravery. These early sequences are quite funny – although not in a laugh out loud way – and suggest a pleasing ability on the part of writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan to think outside of the box (for want of a better term). The city mayor publicly complains about the expense of his exploits and urges him to go to New York, while bystanders at a level crossing where Hancock has just saved PR man Jason Bateman from certain death criticise the way in which he did it and encourage the guy to sue.The mood is pretty dark for much of the time, and Smith's pretty boy looks are sacrificed (until his character begins to undergo redemption, at least) under the glare of harsh lighting. We probably see a truer image of what Smith really looks like here: the rougher skin, the lines, the heavier features of a forty-year-old man that are magically stripped away by ingenious lighting (just compare him in the prison scenes and the restaurant scene), and it suggests that he could make a highly believable bad guy if he chose to.As Hancock undergoes his transformation thanks to the help of the PR man he saved, a totally unexpected twist is thrown into the mix which gives the film its third act just as it's beginning to look like its going nowhere. Of course this is where the plot holes begin to appear, but every film has holes and this one has fewer than many other films which enjoy a better reputation. In the end the film is all about the superhero saving himself – as it is throughout, when you think about it – and this is possibly why it isn't as appreciated as it should be. The film's left open for a sequel, which is already rumoured to have the green light. It's a shame; I think this is one of those films that deserves to stand alone.",Null,4,7,27 September 2009

Shooter," Starts strongly, but falters in the second half
","I saw this film in two sittings and, as luck would have it, interrupted my viewing pretty much at the point where it stops being one type of film - conspiracy thriller - and turns into the routine type of shoot-em-up that Arnie was making back in the mid-eighties. Sadly, that is where the film also starts to deteriorate. Up to this point - where disaffected military man Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and FBI agent Memphis (Michael Pena) pay a visit on the old guy who helped bury the guys who shot President Kennedy - it is an absorbing thriller that places Swagger in a seemingly impossible situation from which, using only his guile and military training, he must extricate himself. After this point, though, the film grows increasingly silly, piling up ludicrous plot twists with alarming speed as it abandons all logic in favour of big explosions and bloody violence.This is the kind of film conspiracy theorists must love. Obviously inspired by the theories of Lee Harvey Oswald's innocence, it contains some neat ideas but is spoiled by too many plot holes and downright unbelievable plot twists (Swagger's immediate release from custody, for example, on his word that he had disarmed all his weapons before leaving home. OK then, you're free to leave? I don't think so, somehow).Danny Glover, in the kind of role usually bagged by Morgan Freeman gives a good account of himself as a Colonel with questionable motives, and Pena is believable in a stereotypical role as the rookie FBI agent who is the only one to believe Swagger's protestations of innocence. Wahlberg is also good, although in a role, it has to be said, that would probably only stretch the most limited of acting talent.",Null,2,4,19 January 2008
Defiance," The Belorussian band of brothers...
","Although I'm not a religious type and know little of any details from the stories of the bible, the parallels this old-fashioned adventure story draws with Moses leading the chosen are unmistakable (although the events depicted here - based on fact, apparently - are on an undeniably smaller scale: instead of a parting of the Red Sea we get a wade through marshland).Such lofty aspirations leave Ed Zwick's film open to questions about the wisdom of such a decision at best, and ridicule at worst. Needless to say, it's best to take the film's claims of authenticity with a pinch of salt and perhaps to overlook the pretentiousness at its core.At the end of the day, Defiance is an old-fashioned war film that could easily have been made back in the forties or fifties. The story has been told a thousand times in a thousand different forms, and its' familiarity means the long running time becomes something of a chore. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber give a good account of themselves as the brothers who find themselves leading a band of Jewish refugees from the Nazis, but the complexities of their relationship are only touched upon, meaning that key moments such as Zus's decision to join the Russian partisans seem to come out of the blue, with no accumulation of incidents to justify his choice.Most other characters, other than Jamie Bell as the youngest brother, are genre stereotypes: the Jewish teacher, the Jewish intellectual, the stern Russian commander, etc, which lends the entire thing a 'by the numbers' feel that means the audience is never as involved in the refugee's plight as they ought to be. The film has its moments, and often looks beautiful, but you'll watch the end credits with the feeling that you've seen it all before.",Null,6,8,28 December 2009
Lord of War," Lord of War
","There seems to have been relatively few high-profile films made recently about the business of arms trading, which is quite surprising really when you consider the potential for development in the action thriller genre. This attempt to shed some light on the shady goings-on in the trade seeks to be more of a study of the mechanics of the business with the usual soapy trimmings regarding the conflict between the protagonist's business and family life, than a thriller and, in this respect, it succeeds very well. Having said that, the glimpse we are given into a world that would otherwise be closed to us, is a strangely sanitised one. Little insight  other than the manipulations of one particular West African despot  is given into the life-threatening, nerve-jangling danger into which an arms dealer must step every time he tries to sell his wares.Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, the son of Ukrainian immigrants (the film fights shy of having its protagonist being a true American. The writer would probably have us believe Orlov's background is instrumental to the direction he takes in life, but the cynic in me can't help thinking that the producers were probably a little worried that the cash tills wouldn't ring so loud if the main character, who after all, profits from the misery and death of others, were home-grown). Cage is not a great actor, and he struggles here which, in a way, testifies to the strength of the script in that it can overcome the usual deficiencies in Cage's performance. A better actor would have had more success in subtly communicating through expression and gesture the personal hell which Orlov  through choice  endures. Everything about him is fake: he lies about his name, and he lies to his family and his trophy wife about what it is that he does for a living. He even seduces his wife with a lie then secretly becomes the only buyer of her ordinary painting when she becomes an artist. There is a rich vein to explore here, but unfortunately Cage muffs it.To survive in his business, Yuri can't afford a conscience so he has one provided for him in the form of his younger brother, ably played by Jared Leto. His conscience, who was once his partner, snorts copious amounts of drugs and has copious amounts of sex with women with names like Candy, and his fate is as predictable as the source of Yuri's eventual 'downfall.' Where this predictability is a (perhaps unavoidable) weakness, the repercussions (or eventual lack of them) is the key to what the whole film is about, and has a veracity about it that is rarely found in mainstream movies. It sums Yuri up more succinctly than the previous 90 minutes of heavily-narrated exposition, and goes some way to explaining the bland, suited disguise behind which he hides.",Null,0,0,31 October 2007
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Good and Bad
","As others have duly noted  and it's a point I'll try not to belabour  Brotherhood is clearly influenced by Saving Private Ryan and, while at times its ferocious battle scenes surpass even the equivalent scenes that shocked us all so much back in '98, overall I don't believe Je-gyu Kang has succeeded in the way that Spielberg did.Brotherhood is really two films in one. Separate the battle scenes from everything else and you have one very good film and one very bad. The brothers' everyday life prior to being essentially press-ganged into the South Korean army is shamefully over-sentimentalised, and the overwrought departure scene in which their mother tearfully chases their train as they head for battle is something that even Griffith might have though twice about back in 1916.The battle scenes are powerful stuff though, planting the viewer right in the thick of the action and creating a violently deranged landscape that reeks with the stench of spilled guts, blood, severed limbs and gunpowder. That one brother can repeatedly skip unharmed past a heavy barrage of bombs, guns and bayonetsin his pursuit of the medal of honour he believes will return his brother to the safety of their mother's bosom is just one of a number of inconsistencies that we have to swallow in the midst of these insane conflicts.Although they are good, the battle scenes number too many so that, despite their rawness, a kind of insensitivity begins to set in. Everything  even the most incredible  becomes ordinary if you're exposed to it too often, and that's what happens here. As a result, the story has to fall back on the (weaker) strand of the decaying relationship between the two brothers and, at times, the conversations between them descend into overwrought melodrama. In this respect, it's difficult to understand who would be entirely satisfied with what we have here (although its rating on this site suggests most would disagree): fans of bloody war films will be dismayed by the regular injections of sentimentality and overwrought emotion while those looking for some depth to the brothers' relationship and the stresses placed upon it by the extremest of situations will also come away feeling short-changed.",Null,4,7,23 May 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Observations...
","Almost as interesting as this tale of men behind bars is the enduring popularity it has enjoyed since being released on video following its poor box office. The reason is fairly clear to see: for all its dark setting, the film is about hope and how hope can set you free. We all have hope, and we all feel imprisoned – whether it's by a dead-end job, a loveless relationship, an out-of-shape body – and it's only the hope that things will somehow improve (even if, unlike Andy Dufresne, we do precious little to help things along) that keeps us going. The Shawshank Redemption validates this blind, irrational hope while simultaneously reinforcing it. This is the film's strength, and it uses it to good advantage. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make believable if unlikely friends – at the beginning of their friendship one lacks hope of any kind while the other is unable to express his feelings, a flaw he later realises is indirectly the reason he finds himself behind bars. By the end of the film both have changed – and both are released.The film makes use of every genre cliché you can think of: the sadistic guard, the corrupt warden – fifty years ago, Hollywood wardens were mostly beneficial characters, but they seem to have lost their way lately – the bull queers, the fish out of water with no chance of survival, etc, and although this isn't necessarily a weakness, it's familiarity means the overlong running time drags on occasion as we're faced with all too familiar situations. And while there are malevolent prisoners present in the form of the bull queers who wander around looking for 'fresh fish' and vulnerable inmates to rape, all other prisoners are a kind of homogeneous mass, a decent enough bunch with few unique characteristics and no malice or resentment towards a society that has effectively discarded them.The irony of the film is that the good guys are the ones behind bars – as Dufresne wryly comments, he had to come to prison to become a criminal – while those ostensibly representing justice and law are violent braggarts and bible-bashing hypocrites. Their come-uppance, when it finally arrives, is wholly deserved, and there are few films that engineer a turning of the tables as wholly complete as the one engineered here by Dufresne – another reason for its phenomenal popularity: we all know, or have known, someone like the warden (although perhaps not as extreme), smug and self-serving, who deserves their come-uppance.Darabont wanted the film to end with Red giving his little 'I hope' bit while the bus he's travelling on disappears over the horizon, and it's a shame the studio didn't let him have his way. That ending on the beach looks exactly like what it is – a tacked on ending to keep the men in suits happy. Andy Dufresne, with his uncompromising sense of purpose, would surely have held firm under their pressure",Null,1,1,16 September 2010
Never Back Down," Hollywood Violence
","Once again, like some mangy old dog who refuses to die, Hollywood regurgitates past 'feasts' to pick through the stew of ideas and pull aside the morsels it considers to be worth digesting once more. The offerings aren't even warmed over any more though, and the result is cardboard tasteless. This woeful effort updates those American movies from the 80s (which were themselves updates of Oriental films from the 70s) in which a young protagonist 'finds' himself with the guiding hand of a wise mentor and a talent for cracking skulls.Sean Faris plays Tyler our outcast hero, living with a mother he doesn't get on with and a precocious younger tennis-playing brother. Tyler's carrying a lot of baggage because his dad died after he let him drive drunk (a fact demonstrated with admirable subtlety by the large number of cardboard boxes he never unpacks when his reduced-size family moves house). Tyler didn't do anything to stop his dad getting behind the wheel you see, and sometimes doing nothing is the wrong thing to do. Same as sometimes you have to be true to yourself, and you have to accept yourself for who you are; you have to know when to make a stand and when to give way, and you have to roll with the punches and realise that right is right and wrong is wrong.Did I miss anything? Oh yeah – you must never, ever, under any circumstances, back down Tyler's mentor, a black dude who lives in his low-rent gym and only accepts clients on the condition that they won't use their fighting skills in the outside world (yeah, right) spends all but the last ten minutes of the film banging on about how violence is the solution to nothing before changing his mind. Turns out violence is the solution after all. (How stupid does he feel?) The violence has to be Hollywood hot, though. You know the sort of thing: it must be performed by (and perpetrated upon) tanned and sculpted bodies in such a way that any resulting bruises will blend tastefully in with the owner's golden-fleshy hues. These injuries might cause a few stiff movements but won't prevent their owner from springing into retaliatory action the split-second their opponent leaves an opening. No blood, other than an occasional trickle at the corner of a mouth, must be seen, regardless of how many times we see a fist hitting its off-screen target with mechanical, piston-like ferocity. In short, it has to be sexy, surrounded by busty bikini-clad high school girls, and have all the nasty sights and sounds excised for the sake of the sensibilities of its mid-teen audience (judging by the aforementioned sanitisation and lack of expletives).Everything about this film – other than the bad guy, who makes an impression – is very ordinary and totally unoriginal. Every now and then a few cheap philosophical platitudes are thrown into the mix in an attempt to add a little depth, but that's really just the writer going through the motions. The only difference between this film and its countless ancestors is the use of the internet",Null,0,0,15 September 2009
The Queen," It should have been called 'Blair'
","The Queen's film title is a bit misleading as this isn't a film about the Queen or her life, but about the manner in which the monarchy reacted to the untimely death of Princess Diana and of how much at odds to the mood of the public this reaction was. As such, it works very well, juxtaposing the royal family's stiff-upper-lip approach to the situation, more correctly belonging to a past generation, with the uncharacteristic public display of grief from the public. In fact, we see no real grief as such from any member of the royals (William and Harry are frequently referred to but play no major part in the film). This change in the nation's outlook and behaviour is signified by the landslide victory of Tony Blair at the general election just a few months before Diana's death, and the rejection of the conservative values under which the country had been governed for the previous eighteen years.The story is allegedly closely based on real conversations that took place during the week following Diana's death and, it has to be said, to me it looked a little too much like an Uncle Tony love-fest. In touch with the nation, resolute in his convictions, and his own man despite the machinations on his behalf by a breezily cynical Alistair Campbell, Blair comes out of the production as a true prince. I almost ended up liking him myself, and I can't stand the bloke in real life. Cherie too, true to her own anti-royalist beliefs, while not perhaps gleaming as brightly as her husband, still comes out of the whole thing with a positive slant. For me, this has to throw into question the veracity of the maker's claims that events on screen closely mirror those in real life. The film is too pro-Blair (even to the point of fabricating his embarrassment during his first audience with the Queen to, presumably, provoke audience sympathy with his character  and to coax it away from the Queen).Mirren is near faultless as HRH (as is Michael Sheen as Blair) and, while it has to be said that she is never treated as anything less than a fair and caring person, prone to the same self-doubts and concerns experienced by us all at some time or another, she emerges in only a slightly better light than when the film began. And even this is only because Blair helped her to see the light and get a little more in tune with the people. The rest of the royal family are treated as the stereotypical nutters the popular press would have us believe they truly are (and it's probably important to state here that I'm not a Royalist and I strongly question the relevance of any royal family in this day and age). Philip is the curmudgeonly old fart, rigidly locked into the attitudes and protocol of a bygone age, while Prince Charles is portrayed as a somewhat weak and vaguely pathetic character, allowing himself to be bullied to a degree by his mother while allying himself with Blair to ensure any fallout lands on her shoulders. He is also borderline paranoid about being shot by a sniper because of his unpopularity, apparently.The film seems to both admire the idea of the monarchy (its passing symbolised by a stag with which the Queen comes to identify  and which is shot, not by a prince, but by a commoner staying at a nearby commercial property), while neither praising its, admittedly reluctant, willingness to change or mourning its passing. As entertainment it is passable, and anyone who remembers those remarkable days after Diana's death will have their memories of that time revived, but as a dramatic account of actual events - I would have to say it is questionable in the extreme.",Null,1,2,17 July 2007
Any Given Sunday," As exciting as the game...
","American football coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) is a man with problems: his team have lost four games in a row and the boss (Cameron Diaz) is pressuring him into dropping his trusty old war-horse (Dennis Quaid); D'Amato's wife has left him; he's drinking too much; his team medic (James Woods) is overdosing the players on pain-killing drugs and ignoring incipient health problems which could result in (gulp) paralysis; and the one ray of hope – an unexpectedly impressive player (don't ask me his position, I'm British – he's the one who throws the ball a lot) called into service when options one and two are both crocked, is ignoring D'Amato's game plays and going his own way with not unimpressive results. Possibly the most important thing I learned watching this film is that, when his attention is turned from conspiracy theories, director Oliver Stone doesn't really have a lot to say – although Pacino's character in this movie could easily be seen as a surrogate for the director's image of himself: beleaguered and misunderstood, but ultimately victorious.When the film isn't deliberating over whether Coach D'Amato will buckle under the pressure it's at pains to draw romanticised parallels between the modern American footballer and gladiators/warriors of old. But by trying to idealise the players while simultaneously providing a salacious insight into their hedonistic excesses away from the pitch, the film creates a glaring contradiction that simply serves to distance the audience even further from its deified characters. Stone's typically breakneck style of storytelling is really the only thing that sets it apart from what is, when stripped of its glossy veneer, an alarmingly stale and clichéd plot. How many times have we seen the ageing warhorse overcoming his self-doubts to win for the coach one last time? The player whose life is football and who is willing to risk paralysis in order to keep on playing? The morally ambiguous doctor willing to overlook the Hippocratic Oath in order to enable these 'warriors' to pursue their dream? The executive losing sight of the meaning of the game while engaged in the irksome politics of big business? Off-duty players snorting cocaine from the breasts of high-class hookers? Well, OK, we might not have witnessed the last one often (enough), but the other plot strands have been done to death a hundred times over.Pacino wanders through the movie with an expression that swings like a metronome from anger to bewilderment. His choice of roles has become increasingly open to question as he grows older, but this one at least seems to suit his rugged, weary countenance. Jamie Foxx as Willie Breaman, the hotshot newcomer, is convincing enough without ever really stamping his authority on the role, but a miscast Cameron Diaz is sorely out of her depth as the owner of the Miami Sharks and becomes all but invisible in the scenes she shares with Pacino.Any Given Sunday isn't a bad movie, but neither is it a thing of any worth. Stone refuses to allow the camera to settle for more than a second at a time, and injects random images into intimate conversations that just don't do anything other than make you wonder why he's doing it. And in the end, you get the impression he knew only too well how weak his material was and attempted to distract us all with a display of cinematic pyrotechnics.",Null,0,0,18 September 2011
Casino Royale," No No Seven
","The Bond franchise seems have taken a curious decision here, going back to the roots of the Bond legend and therefore giving us a Bond movie that isn't really a Bond movie at all, but rather a pre-Bond movie. Daniel Craig's Bond is something of an arrogant hothead, more smug than suave, who finds himself in the kind of predicaments that Connery et al never would. I can't imagine Sean having his goolies whacked while strapped naked to a seatless chair somehow. Definitely a tougher, more cynical Bond, the fact that he isn't the finished article shouldn't be held against Craig, who does reasonably well (although using an actor with the rugged features of Craig in a story going back to roots of a character previously portrayed by the suave likes of Connery, Moore and Brosnan seems a bizarre casting choice and just made it that more difficult to believe I was watching a Bond flick).The ending possibly bodes well for future instalments (the introduction of the Bond theme only after Craig has uttered Bond's immortal intro line was one of the few high points). Let's hope so - because all through this all I could think about was how much I missed the old Bonds.",Null,7,10,2 July 2007

Live Free or Die Hard," Nothing special
","John McClane returns after a decade or so, looking a little bruised and battered before the action even begins it has to be said, and the subtlety of his everyman persona is extinguished within the first five minutes as we see him in the badly written role of over-protective father to a feisty McClane-clone daughter. That early scene served warning of how far the franchise has fallen. It's still good in terms of summer blockbuster fare, but it is unrecognisable as the spawn of the 80s original. Willis as McClane back then redefined the genre  here he's just doing an Arnie impersonation as he slides around on the wing of an out-of-control fighter plane and issues warnings to the bad guy that he's coming to get him.After that early worrying insight into McClane's domestic woes, things start to get back on track as we see McClane and his suspect/sidekick embroiled in a high-tech game of cat-and-mouse around the streets of Washington in what is a cute and effective reversal of the 'confined space' scenario of the originals. Willis and Justin Long play well off each other and, while Timothy Olyphant's set-up is a little too Blofeld-like for this franchise, the systematic shutdown of society's high-tech infrastructure is as entertaining as it is outrageous.Sadly, writer Mark Bomback runs out of ideas in the final third of the film and reverts to typical action-hero clichés. The film careers alarmingly out of control, abandoning reality for the sake of 'look-what-we-can-do' effects that have that aforementioned fighter plane dipping under bridges in pursuit of McClane's truck. ('You're shooting at the wrong guy!' Willis screams at the pilot, and I couldn't help wondering how often those words had been screamed by other victims of similar mistakes in the last eighteen years). The climax is particularly weak  I can't recall ever seeing a bad guy meet his end so lamely or irrationally  after all, surely if McClane can survive the impact of the bullet it would do even less damage to Gabriel.For mindless high-impact entertainment you probably won't need to look any further than this one. But, sadly that's all that's left of the original superlative idea  and after a break of ten years or so you'd have thought they could have done better..",Null,0,0,16 November 2007
The Great Escape," I Can't See A Bloody Thing!
","What a terrific movie The Great Escape is  and what a unique position it has captured in the hearts of the British public. Nearly half-a-century after it was made the TV stations still trot it out on at least one public holiday each year for us to enjoy and, even after numerous viewings, it's always a pleasure to watch. The near-three hour running time simply flies by, propelled by Bernstein's rousing score and a raft of memorable scenes that, it seems, will always remain in the public consciousness.I saw this on the big screen last night, and to see it in all its Panavision glory really is an experience that adds immeasurably to the enjoyment, even though it would have been nice to have seen a restored print. The story, of course, is timeless, even though some of the stiff-upper-lips unintentionally teeter on the brink of parody, and the film takes us from one memorable scene to another: Hiltz bouncing his baseball in the confines of his cell, the body of little Ives (Angus Lennie, whose performance is tempered somewhat by childhood memories of his later appearance as stroppy chef Shooie McPhee in Crossroads) hanging from the barbed wire fence; the doomed Blythe (Donald Pleasance) meticulously counting his steps from the door to the pin he has strategically placed on the floor in an attempt to fool his comrades that he isn't going blind; Cavendish falling through the beds from which Hiltz has removed the slats; Gordon Jackson's character falling for the same trick that he earlier berates a fellow comrade for doing; David McCallum's desperate dash down the train platform after killing a Gestapo officer. And of course Steve McQueen's iconic escape attempt at the Swiss border on a hijacked German motorbike Terrific stuff.",Null,0,1,10 March 2009
Pineapple Express," Average comedy with a few highs
","Rogen and Apatow are probably responsible for the bulk of half-decent comedies coming out of Hollywood these days, although even they are prone to the occasional dud. This one - which definitely isn't a dud - follows the misadventures of Saul, a minor league drug dealer and his best customer Dale Denton, a going-nowhere process server who find themselves on the run from both cops and villains after Dale witnesses the murder of a man by Ted (Gary Cole), another drug dealer a couple of dozen rungs up the ladder from Saul.The story is an uneasy combination of low-level humour and violent action, a curious choice which, together with a protracted final sequence, is one of the film's major weaknesses. Where the film scores is with the central performances from James Franco and Seth Rogen as the hapless heroes who spend most of their time either in a narcotic haze or a state of high anxiety. Rogen pretty much repeats his trademark affable everyman which has stood him in good stead so far and still seems to be working well. James Franco maybe isn't as well known for comic performances but he holds his own against Rogen. Danny McBride also scores as Red, the duo's luckless friend whose survival of a succession of fatal injuries harks back to the violent Warner cartoons of the 40s and 50s.To be honest, the biggest laughs were all up there in the trailer, but there's enough here to keep you entertained, even if a slightly too long running time means you won't be too disappointed when the final credits roll.",Null,2,6,26 April 2009
Annihilation," Annihilation review
","Intriguing and intelligent, but also confusing, Annihilation is the kind of film that deserves a sequel or two in order to expand on ideas that sometimes feel only half-formed. Alec Garland's movie features a different kind of alien invasion - one that alters the environment it enters rather than killing those it encounters. Some do die, and in horribly imaginative ways, but it's to the film's credit that its cerebral and physical aspects complement one another so well within a relentlessly ominous atmosphere.",Null,1,1,5 May 2020
Aladdin," Surprised by all the positive comments
","I found this Disney re-working to be an incredibly pedestrian affair, with the animation itself the only truly laudable aspect of the whole affair. The story is changed from the tale of old, and although I don't have a problem with that, the Americanisation of the character Aladdin and the endless spewing of anachronistic pop-culture references by Robin William's hyper-kinetic Genie give the film a plastic, manufactured feel.If Robin William's manic style of delivery isn't your cup of tea you're going to hate this film. While his character is intensely annoying, he does at least lift the film from the lethargic mire into which it had settled before he makes his belated entrance. The story is boring and predictable, the jokes weak and the songs mostly forgettable. The film's uneasy blending of modern-day materialistic preoccupation and Arabian Knights mythology doesn't work, and its sniffy dismissal of foreign cultures and positive assertion of Western aspirations borders on racism. Only the evil vizier Jafar, reminiscent of Basil Rathbone at his most villainous, scores as a memorable character...",Null,2,8,30 December 2009
Coach Carter," True Story Hollywood Style
","I suppose it is to this picture's credit that, for a story so familiar to us all, it manages to be reasonably entertaining despite an overblown running time and some seriously broad strokes when it comes to the characterisation of the boys in the basketball team. Jackson gives a typically dynamic performance, and is really what keeps the film so watchable. Everybody else just sort of blends into the background when he's around, which is quite appropriate really when you consider the generic nature of their characters. Based on a true story, you can't help feeling, due to the sometimes overly neat plot developments, that the writers, in true Hollywood fashion, have played hard and fast with those true moments they claim to bring to the screen.",Null,0,0,30 April 2007
True Romance," This will be remembered as one of Tarantino's best...
","This one is Tarantino's wish-fulfilment movie (even though Tony Scott directed), written when he was still an unknown video store clerk, so we have a largely friendless comic-store clerk named Clarence (Christian Slater) winning over novice hooker Alabama (an impossibly cute and sexy Patricia Arquette) with his guileless charm and then putting one over on all manner of bad guys.This is a good film. Everything Tarantino touched pre-1997 was fresh and new and entertaining, and back then he was only filling his films with references to his favourite movies instead of ripping them off under the guise of paying homage. Here, the film fairly bulges with these references, from movies playing on TVs in the background to posters on toilet walls to the wallpaper in the runaway couples' motel room and the Badlands-style voice-over and music. The dialogue isn't as hip as it would be in Dogs and Fiction, but it's still good and there are some stand-out scenes  two of which involve interrogations in which the person being interrogated turns the tables on their persecutor in different but equally effective ways.The other thing that should be touched upon is the quality of the cast. This one really is a one-off: Slater, Arquette, Oldman, Walken, Hopper, Jackson, Gandolfini, Pitt, Kilmer  it reads like a list of who is, was, or is going to be. No doubt Tarantino can still assemble such a starry line-up, but whether he will ever again be able to fashion such a spirited, entertaining and unpretentious piece of work is open to question.",Null,1,3,14 April 2008
Valkyrie," Suspenseful Account of an Attempt on Hitler's Life
","I'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise – although I can understand why he's a movie star – but he's actually quite good here. He plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the German soldier who led the most famous plot to kill Hitler in the last months of WWII. It's a story that, while perhaps not well known in terms of detail, is familiar enough for everyone watching to know that the mission failed, so despite a rather dull opening third, the film does well to generate some suspense once the plan is actually set in motion.There's no doubting the fact that not all Germans serving in the German army during the war were Nazis, but the quality of noble righteousness with which the character of von Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators are painted tends to rankle a little. Had they attempted to kill their fuehrer in the late 30s, when Hitler began his policy of invading neighbouring countries for liebensraum (living room) for the German people, or even in the early years of the 40s when victory in the war looked like a real possibility, I might be more inclined to believe these men were working for a noble cause. Since the attempt on Hitler's life took place in the summer of 1944, when most strategists were already agreed that it was only a question of when – not if – Germany capitulated, I can't help wondering whether self-preservation wasn't more of a factor when it came to going through with the plot.Anyway, the film itself is a lot better than people believed it would be when the release date kept being put back. There was speculation that the reason was Cruise's German accent, but he – like all the other characters – doesn't even attempt one. That doesn't really bother me – I understand the reasons (and nobody ever complains that Gladiator wasn't in Latin). The film is filled with familiar British character actors, all of whom deliver believable performances (Bill Nighy as the vacillating General Olbricht in especially good.) Even Eddie Izzard turns up (without his frock) in a small role. I also liked the portrayal of Hitler by David Bamber. No bombastic tyrant, very little ranting, just a slight, ageing man with stooped shoulders and a slightly distracted air about him at times who seems to sense that things are slipping from his grasp.",Null,1,2,6 August 2009

The Fighter," Opponents aren't always confined to the ring...
","On paper this movie looks just like every other boxing movie churned out by Hollywood in the last eighty years or so: a boxer rated by nobody overcomes the odds to have a crack at a title fight and win the respect of his peers. What sets this one apart is the fact that the boxing itself takes a back seat for the most part while the story concentrates on the interplay between the key members of real-life boxer Micky Ward's mightily dysfunctional family.Mark Wahlberg as Ward is the leading man, but in reality it's Christian Bale's picture. He plays Dicky, the crack-addicted older brother of Micky who once shared the ring with Sugar Ray Leonard (who makes a cameo appearance) and even put him on the canvas (or did he?). Bale, who lost a huge amount of weight and closely studied the real-life Dicky, inhabits the role so completely that he commands your attention when he's on the screen, and when he isn't leaves you wondering when he's going to come back .The film was made with the full co-operation of Ward and his family, so it's quite surprising that the film pulls no punches when showing all their quirks and shortcomings. They're a boozy lot, ruled over by a domineering, tarty mother (Melissa Leo) who leads her long-suffering husband a miserable dance and rules with the sharpest of tongues a gaggle of homely daughters who seem to do nothing other than sit in hypocritical judgment of anyone unfortunate enough to cross their path. In the midst of all this, Wahlberg looks kind of lost, and is largely called upon simply to respond to the chaos that surrounds him even when he finally gets his boxing career on line.So, although on paper The Fighter contains all the typical genre tropes, it provides a raw, unflinching insight into the domestic pressures a journeyman boxer must overcome from which most other boxing movies shy away. This is probably one of the top five US movies of 2010.",Null,0,0,18 July 2011
V for Vendetta," Guy Fawkes Knight
","The graphic novel on which this Wachowski Brother's film is based was an allegory of Thatcher's Britain of the Eighties, so it's surprising how well (or even better) it works as a similar allegory of Blair's duplicitous government in the wake of 9/11. Truth is spun by men in suits into something unrecognisable, civilians are spied upon, and are subjugated by the skilled exploitation of their fears Â– which have largely been invoked by the very people who exploit them. The fact that a film which has, truthfully, to be lumped into the superhero genre, is so prescient is incredible.The film is in the grand guignol style; our (anti)-hero, a masked phantom of the opera type who lives in what looks like a castle, is reminiscent, at times, of the swashbuckling types from Hollywood flicks of the thirties and forties: a last musketeer, still using blades when the rest of the world has moved on to semi-automatics. But that's the way it has to be, because V is a throwback to an earlier time; a time when heroes were honourable men who defended our land rather than our goalmouth, and social disorder was a result of grievance rather than greed. Weaving is very good behind his mask, while Portman makes a fetching heroine. John Hurt, Winston Smith in a film of which this is a recognisable descendant, is a nice touch as the fascist dictator whom V seeks to depose. Rea, however, has a thankless role, as the plodding policeman always one step behind.Despite the way it was marketed, this isn't a film for the hardcore action fan. The story's a little convoluted (although that's not necessarily a criticism) and there's as much going on behind the scenes as there is on the screen.",Null,1,4,16 April 2007
