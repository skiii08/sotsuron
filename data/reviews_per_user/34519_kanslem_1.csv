Walk the Line," Honest film
","No holds were barred in this film.Cash is shown as a drug addicted womanizer. He is also shown as a man that was hurt as a child and fought with this through his whole life.His relationship with his father was tortured at best, and this film shows it. An excellent film, that doesn't make Cash a saint, but shows him for his true-self.If you are a true fan of the man (and not just his music) you will love it.If you are looking for a true story from a true man, featuring great actors and actresses, you will love it. If you are looking for Hollywood tripe, look elsewhere.",10,0,0,27 July 2006
