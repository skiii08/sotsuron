Vertigo," Love, love, love this movie!
","Okay, so I love this movie just a little! But what's not to love! One Of Hitchcock's greatest movies in my opinion. There are so many good characters in this movie - but I almost think my favorite character is the city of San Francisco. Not really, it's Jimmy Stewart. BUT San Fran sure figures prominently in the movie. What a gorgeous city. Perhaps I'm a little partial because my husband & I spent our honeymoon there 20 years ago. The cinematography alone is worth seeing this movie as it is filmed beautifully. Also, there is some artistic twists like the green lights and haze in Novaks apartment.This movie is definitely a great plot twister the 1st time you see it. It of course loses some of the bang with subsequent viewings since you know the twist. However, subsequent viewings are still enjoyable as I always notice different tidbits and details I didn't catch before.I love Jimmy Stewart in his love-sick puppy, obsession role. I love the title theme music. It starts creating tension right off the bat, and keeps your pulse going throughout the movie, anticipating what is going to happen next.I just recently re-watched the movie (probably my 5-6th time) with my 14 year old daughter, who was seeing it for the first time. I had yet been able to convince her to watch any old, classic movies with me ( too old fashioned in her mind). But for whatever reason, she agreed this time. And what a great 1st classic movie for her to see. I was surprised but she not only stuck with it all the way to the end, but was actually somewhat riveted throughout the movie! What surprised me is she somewhat predicted the ending ahead of time. That kind of shocked me because I never saw it coming the first time I watched.I'm not sure why, but Midge's character creeps me out more with each viewing. Especially the painting scene - she seems like a stalker, obsessed lover. But Bel Geddes plays her beautifully.You definitely have to see this movie. It is one of Hitchcock's best!",9,7,9,7 July 2008
The Incredible Hulk," Mediocre movie for me....
","I don't have strong feelings one way or the other for this movie. My teenage kids wanted to go - so we went. I'm not a big comic-book, or superhero fan - apart from the Spiderman and Superman franchises. I do remember the Hulk TV series from the 70's and I saw the previous Hulk movie several years ago.Overall, this movie kept me somewhat entertained and engaged. I just can't say I got truly vested in any of the characters or their fates.I guess I understand that Marvel has started their own movie production company and that is why we have another Hulk film so quickly after the last one. But I think their lack of experience shows as I just don't think there was a lot of intense action.I did like the casting and everyone performs sufficiently. But again, nothing really stands out to me. It seems I have already forgotten much of what I saw - and it has only been a couple months.So I guess my final analysis is that it is forgettable...",6,2,6,27 July 2008
Mission: Impossible III," I was surprised I liked this!
","This isn't usually my type of movie so I had never bothered to see it. Well, TNT has been running it constantly the last several weekends and my 12 yr. old son happened to watch. He said it was one of the best movies he has seen and even thought I might like it. But my tastes and my son's don't always jive - but I thought I'd try it.Well, I have to say I found it very entertaining and definitely action packed. But not too much action because I don't like the kind that has your head hurting from all violence,etc. The special effects are amazing and everything looked so realistic. That is, from a visual perspective at least - that's not to say everything is logical or plausible. I also liked that there was good plot development which I often find lacking in some of the action packed movies. Seems a lot of movies in that genre think that if they are loud and fast enough, and blow up enough things and crash enough cars, that plot isn't necessary.Cruise really puts his heart in his performance, as he does most of his roles. I haven't seen any of the other MI films so I was surprised to not feel lost watching just the 3rd installment of the franchise.The musical score is very engaging and matches the action without being too distracting. And who doesn't recognize the very distinctive MI theme? All in all, a great way to spend an afternoon. Highly entertaining!",7,0,1,14 December 2008
United 93," I don't think this film should have been made for profit - it's disrespectful
","I have many mixed emotions about this film. Yes, I think we need to remember and honor those who were lost that day. But I don't think it should be done by the 'entertainment' industry and by people out to make a buck on the tragedy of others.I think it is much better to have these stories told as documentaries on TV, and any and ALL profits should go to a victims memorial fund. I think it is cheap change to have thrown a mere 10% of profits from the FIRST 3 days ONLY to the memorial fund. Okay, so it amounted to a little over $1 million, but how much more money did the producers and Universal line their pockets with? I just think that is wrong. Shame on you - you should not profit off the misery of others like that. And it was not just a tragedy to the people on that plane and their families. 9/11 happened to all Americans that day - we all were affected and devastated to one extent or another.",4,0,7,10 November 2008
Deja Vu," Things that make you go 'hmmmmm'...
","I really enjoyed this film. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. At points, my head hurt from trying to figure out all the twists and turns - primarily from attempting to figure out the whole time travel aspect. Even though I've seen the film several times now, I'm still not sure I have it totally figured out. But I like when a film has me second guessing my own conclusions. It almost means you have to watch it multiple times to uncover things you may have missed the first time around. This film is definitely like that.Denzel does a good job, but I wouldn't say this is one of my favorites of his performances. Although I do like him in this. I just think this film is less of a character story and is more about the plot itself of traveling to the past and whether we can alter outcomes. So my focus was always more on that, than on the characters themselves. It would have been neat to see Halle Berry in the role of Claire - I wasn't familiar with the girl that played Claire (Paula Patton). It creeped me out a little that the same dude (Jim Caviezel) that played Jesus in PASSION OF THE Christ played the terrorist here. Just doesn't seem right somehow.There are some good action shots. I think it's great they chose to shoot in New Orleans as their economy definitely needed help after Katrina.Go to the message boards if you want to try to analyze timelines, parallel universes, wormholes, paradoxes and such. I looked at some of that, and it just made me more confused. I say, just watch the movie and enjoy it for all the pulse-pumping, adrenalin-raising thrills!",9,0,1,17 February 2009
Kung Fu Panda," I was a little disappointed, but I did enjoy it
","This was a really cute movie - but I think I expected a little more than it actually delivered. I guess it didn't help that it was perpetually hyped and marketing as the best animated movie ever. I'm not sure it quite lives up to that high of billing.What I did really like about it was the animation and artwork. The colors were absolutely gorgeous and brilliant. Everything seemed to almost jump off the screen at you. I also really liked Jack Black's portrayal as the underdog who becomes the hero. He has the self-deprecating personality to begin with that fit well here.Some disappointments were that some big name A list stars seem to barely have bit parts here - like Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan. I would have liked to hear more from their characters. Jolie's rendition seemed to be especially flat and emotionless - but perhaps she was trying to portray a steely tigress. But it sounded like she was just reading lines. I also think there were few laugh out loud moments for me - and I would have expected more.Overall, a very cute family movie (we sure need more of those) with a positive message. Just don't see it with too high expectations.",7,1,2,27 December 2008
Au Revoir les Enfants," Holocaust through the eyes of children
","I have seen a lot of movies covering the WWII era, but none from the perspective of children. This makes this movie especially poignant and moving.It centers around boys that attend an all boys Convent school in France. It is a French foreign language film and there are subtitles in English. I'm not a big fan of subtitles, but somehow they didn't bother me here. The storytelling was engrossing enough that the subtitles seemed almost non-exist. I was able to follow along quite naturally - which for me is unusual for a foreign film.The child actors are all quite good, especially the main ones. I did find that there were quite a few crude exchanges between the boys, that I think would have been better left out. I know they were trying to portray the gutter talk that boys will resort to when left to their own devices. I think some of the boys were a little young to be participating in this. Again, perhaps this is a product of being at an all boys school with younger and older boys mixed in together in tight living quarters.I think this film is a great portrayal of friendship. I also believe it succeeds in showing us the worst in humanity, and balances it by showing us some of the best. I think the risk the priest took (and the ultimate sacrifice he paid because of it) shows us how in the worst of times, ordinary people rise to the occasion.",8,1,2,2 September 2008
We Were Soldiers," Very gripping and intense depiction of war
","I was just born right before the Vietnam 'conflict' started, so of course I have no personal recollection of events. But my mom's 1st cousin was a chopper pilot there, and my husband's Uncle also served in combat there. So I grew up hearing bits and pieces - although neither man would ever discuss it in detail.So I was very interested to see what I have heard to be a realistic account of one of the battles of Vietnam. Like Saving Private Ryan, and Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers left me with an awe and respect for all those men and women who have fought and died to give us all the freedoms we enjoy.I think what has always bothered me, is how I heard these Vietnam vets were treated that returned home. I heard my mother-in-law share how her brother was spat upon, called baby-killer and other horrible names. These were young men (boys, really) that had no choice but to go when they were drafted. It was 'kill or be killed'. At least since then, it appears the country has learned a lesson how to better treat returning soldiers from the Iraq war, irregardless of people's view of the war.What I like about this movie is that it appears they were purposely trying to avoid political commentary. Every film about Vietnam, from The Green Berets to Apocalypse Now, seems to have a political ax to grind. Lost in all the political rhetoric of these past films have been the men who actually fought and died. This film is a tribute to the courage of the men who fought and who died there. They were soldiers and they acted like it. One can argue all day long about whether we had any business in Vietnam. But I was pleased and moved to see a film honoring the too often forgotten or politicized soldiers. Those veterans deserve this honor. Thank you to all Vietnam veterans who have suffered greatly with so little thanks from our country.",8,5,9,20 July 2008
The Best Years of Our Lives," A joy to watch!
","This film ranks up there as one of my favorites.. I love movies from the 40's, especially when dealing with WWII. This film is about the lives of servicemen upon their return home after the war. For them, surviving the war was just the start. Now they had to survive reintegrating back into society, their family, their jobs (if they still had one).I think this film brings up so many important issues these men and their families faced. WWII took place before I was born, so I do't have any personal reference on which to draw. So it is eye-opening for me to be able to get the personal perspective of what these brave men and women faced. Granted, the movies aren't exactly telling the whole truth, but it is informative nonetheless. It gives us a snapshot of that time and generation.The cast couldn't have been better in their roles. I was drawn into all their stories, not just by their good acting but the superb script writing as well. Dana Andrews' performance stood out most to me - he was so likable and then you hate the fact that he has such a cold, heartless wife. I'm sure this created a lot of conflict in the typical 40's viewer, as it has you rooting for a divorce so that it clears the way for sweet Teresa Wright's character.I am so grateful for the sacrifices made by the servicemen and women in our country. This film is a reminder of those sacrifices, not only on the battlefield, but at the home front as well.",8,1,1,12 July 2008
The Devil Wears Prada," 'A million girls would kill for this job.'
","Or so they kept telling us throughout the entire movie. This movie was very predictable in two ways.First, Meryl Streep delivers a performance extraordinaire. But what else would you expect. She is an amazing actress and delivers a very understated but intense performance as Miranda Priestly. Her low speaking voice and restrained movements were a surprising way to give a tyrant boss a different facade than the typical yelling and screaming.Second, it was predictable in that the plot had absolutely no surprises in it. Everything seemed so completely uncreative. It's all been said or done before. Girl moves to the big city, gets a big break in her first job for an industry she could care less about. She dresses frumpy and doesn't fit in. But then she begins to care and starts to become like the people she made fun of in the beginning. She alienates friends and family, all in the name of getting ahead. The only surprise in the whole thing is I'm surprised Meryl agreed to star in such a weakly written film.Yes, Meryl does elevate the picture and it is worth seeing just to see her interpretation of the character. But beyond that, there's not much else to see here.",6,0,0,16 January 2009
The Bourne Identity," I love the whole series of Bourne movies!
","I'm not a big fan of Bond movies, or car chases scenes, but in spite of this things, this movie blew me away. The suspenseful plot, the great characters and the twists kept me glued to my seat.The action in this movie is some of the best I've seen. The fight scenes were so intense and believable. I can't imagine how sore the actors were after these scenes.Car chase scenes have always bored me to tears, but the ones here are legendary. It puts you right in the drivers seat where you experience every impact and narrow escape. How they pulled off these stunts in busy streets like they did is pure genius.My only complaint was Franka Potente as Marie. She wasn't female romantic lead material in my book. But perhaps she was meant to lend a more European feel to the movie.",8,2,2,1 January 2009
Radio," A true 'feel good' movie that will warm you heart!
","This is a great heartwarming story that the whole family can watch and enjoy, both young and old, which is rare! It is even made better by the fact that this is based on a true story. I love movies that remind us of and reinforce the good in humanity.This film won a CAMIE award, which stands for 'Character and Morality in Entertainment', which recognizes movies that are entertaining and uplifting. I didn't even know this award existed until this movie won one. (If you like to see inspiring movies, check out their website for past winners at camieawards.org) This story, from the writer of 'The Rookie', is inspired by real events in the life of a mentally-challenged man named Radio (Gooding Jr.), who won the heart of a high school football coach, (Harris) a South Carolina football team and eventually the town of Anderson, SC. The story explores how Radio overcomes his handicap and personal struggles through kindness and compassion from Coach Harold Jones.Some people will find this too sentimental and cheesy. But if you like positive messages and stories of hope and overcoming adversity, you will love this movie, as I did.",7,6,7,27 July 2008
Cast Away," Brilliant Tom Hanks performance, coupled with daring direction
","I thought this movie was good the first time I saw it. But I have probably seen it another 8 times since then and it never fails to keep my attention. Here's why:<ul><li>Hanks delivers an amazing performance. Not only does he undergo drastic physical changes throughout the movie that renders his character's plight so convincingly. But the fact that the majority of the picture is JUST him, on an island, with very little dialogue, no background music, etc. What a huge risk to have to carry a movie by yourself, but boy does he deliver.</li></ul><ul><li>The cinematography and location shooting is amazing. NO fake process shots, it's all the real deal.</li></ul><ul><li>I thought the airplane crash special effects were amazing. I was scared out of my mind, it was so believable.</li></ul><ul><li>I think the director was daring to have so much silence and no background music the majority of his time on the island. I'm not sure many would have attempted this. But I think it is one of things that makes this picture unique and memorable.</li></ul><ul><li>The ending is quite poignant. I don't often cry during movies, but the scene with Hanks and Hunt in the street in the rain had me balling my eyes out.</li></ul>One of the closing lines has always stuck with me: 'And I know what I have to do now. I gotta keep breathing. Because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?' Great stuff!",9,4,6,8 November 2008
Cold Mountain," A difficult movie to watch...
","I am from NC and was intrigued when I first heard of this movie. First, because it was based on a novel by a first time author. How amazing to score such a huge first success on your rookie novel. It also interested me that much of the story is set in Cold Mountain, which is an area near Asheville, NC (only a few hours from here). The other item that got my attention is that part of the story is based on true accounts of a member of Charles Frasier's family that did desert during the war and walked many miles home.With all that said - I finally watched the movie not knowing much else what to expect. Needless to say, it has a horribly tragic ending. I'm not sure I saw that coming. There are some very raunchy scenes that rightly have this as an 'R' rating - notably the scene where the women trap Inman and his buddy and turn the deserters in. I also found the role of the corrupt preacher very offensive - but when does Hollywood every portray clergy in a positive light, so no surprise there.But the love story is very haunting and you can't help but be drawn into a love so strong that a man would go to the lengths he does to be reunited with Ada. Zellweger's performance deserves all the accolades she received.I think my final analysis is that the movie is a very raw depiction of human nature - both the worst and the best of it.",8,3,5,27 July 2008
Gone with the Wind," A review by a Southern-belle...
","Being from the south, I have always been fascinated with Southern history and heritage. While I'm ashamed of the slavery issue, we cant deny its existence. I grew up near several old southern plantations. I was even an 'Azalea Belle' in a local festival in my teen years - complete with hoop skirt and spiral curls in my hair.There is a certain nostalgia and charm to the old south that no doubt has captured the imagination of many that find this film so unforgettable. The old oaks trees covered in moss, the huge plantation houses with giant columns,etc.One of my favorite aspects of the film is just to focus on the beautiful Technicolor cinematography that truly was an astounding achievement for 1939. I would have loved to see the faces of the first audiences to experience this marvel firsthand. I also love to study the amazingly beautiful and lavish sets. The furniture and costumes enthrall me every time I watch.And who can surpass Vivien Leigh at the height of her beauty and charm. Her facial expressions and use of her eyes are entrancing. You can't help but fall under her spell, like all the poor boys who were unfortunate enough to cross paths with her.And I don't know that I have ever encountered a more sympathetic character than Melanie, portrayed so unforgettably by Olivia de Havilland. Has there ever been a longer suffering, unselfish person ever portrayed in cinema? Clark Gable is at his usual cad-like best. Not too much of a stretch for him to portray, but you can't imagine anyone else in the role. Truly, Scarlett met her match in Rhett Butler.My only slight criticism would be for Asley Wilkes character, played by Howard. I always found it hard to see what Scarlett saw in him - other than he was the one man she couldn't have. I never considered him much of a prize. He was a little annoying and cowardly to me. Poor excuse for a man if you ask me.Margaret Mitchell's novel truly came to life to millions of fans of her book. I'm not sure there has even been, before or since, a better adaptation from novel to film. And of course there was the legendary search for the perfect Scarlett - who could have asked for better PR going into a film.The story has so many memorable aspects to it. There are the suspense filled scenes - like when all the women are gathered together, while the 'menfolk' are cleaning out Shantytown of the undesirables who attacked Scarlett. There are the heartbreaking scenes that will have you in tears - like Bonnie Blue's event ( I wont give it away), Mr. O'Hara's accident or Melanie's final fate. You will be moved to outrage at some of Scarlett's antics, while at the same time rooting for her as well. So the whole movie quietly wages an inner conflict as you want Scarlett to get what she deserves, but yet has you feeling sorry for her at the same time.The Civil War ultimately was won by survivors - regardless what side of the Mason-Dixon line you were born. And I think that is what Scarlett represents to the audience. She is a Survivor with a capital S - even if we don't agree with her methods!",10,3,5,4 January 2009
Million Dollar Baby," Not 'Rocky for Girls'!
","I have just now managed to see this film in its entirety. We tried to rent it one time, but were assaulted by the language so couldn't get through it. But AMC ran it last night and managed to clean up some of the worst. Sorry, I'm a little old fashioned. It's a shame that Hollywood thinks that in order to be entertained we have to have a four-letter word every other sentence. Especially since I think this is a story that kids could watch, if not for the language. Anyways, enough of my soapbox.I went into this thinking it would be a recycled 'Rocky' formula but with a female lead instead. But I was surprised. The first half of the movie does set itself up like that - as it is a true boxing story. But then the 2nd half changes completely and becomes more of a character and relationship piece. It really felt like 2 different movies in 1.Clint and Hillary's performances were superb. Morgan doesn't ever seem to do much 'acting' in his movies, it appears he just plays himself in every role. However, I do love his voice and think Clint did well in choosing him to narrate. I absolutely despised the people playing Maggie's family so that was a good piece of casting.Yes, this is a sport movie, but it's also a very touching story of a relationship between 2 unlikely characters. This a movie that both men and women can find something to keep their interest.",9,2,4,14 July 2008
Invincible," Down-on-luck guy makes it to the big time
","This movie is inspired by the story of Vince Papale. The basic plot is a bartender who plays street ball answers an open tryout for the Philedelphia Eagles. To everyones surprise, he not only makes it but goes on to play for 3 seasons.It should be noted that the producers took dramatic license and altered some facts. First of all, Vince had played pro ball before - he played for 2 seasons for the WFL for the Philedelphia Bells prior to trying out for the Eagles. That fact was left out to make it seem even more unlikely that this average Joe can just walk on and make the NFL. Also, he wasn't from South Philly - he was from Prospect Park which is about 30 miles away.But details aside, it is still a very inspiring story. Philly and a lot of the country was experiencing hard times in the 70's. Much like we are now. And everybody loves an underdog that rises form the ashes and makes good.They did a good job in creating the characters that surround Vince to keep it interesting. I like the touch of having his wife walk out just prior to his trying out - and writing that nasty note that goes on to inspire him to NEVER GIVE UP.There is nostalgia galore for those of us who experienced the 70's - from the crazy clothes (men playing football in short-shorts with tube socks), the great soundtrack music, the muscle cars, mutton-chop sideburns, and very BUSY wallpaper. Were the 70's really sepia-toned? (I guess it could've been depending on what you were smoking). They used some type of dark lens or color filter in the filming so as to add to the nostalgic feel.There were some memorable moments in the film. It was heartbreaking when he comes home to his empty apartment to learn his wife has left and took everything, leaving behind a heartless note to add to his humiliation. You wait in breathless anticipation with Vince as he sits alone in his Training camp dorm room with his playbook in hand - listening to the coach's steps approaching outside his door, letting players go. There is the funny moment when you hear Vince 'losing his lunch' in the bathroom before his first game, only to see Coach Vermeil exit the next stall - having just done the same. I think the neighborhood pickup game filmed in the rain was beautifully filmed (especially the slow motion) and communicated how much these guys loved the game. And who can forget the moment in his first home game when Vince finally sees success as he tackles the kickoff returner - and then stops and point ups to his friends who are going crazy in the the stands.There is a lot to cheer for in this feel-good film. There are themes of friendship, courage, determination and, ultimately, about never giving up. It's also a film you can watch with the whole family, which is rare these days. You will leave this movie smiling and feeling inspired!",8,0,1,15 February 2009
The Great Raid," What a great story - I'm glad someone has finally told it
","I had never heard an account of the rescue of the American POW's at Cabanatuan. WWII was over 20 years before I was born, so obviously I wouldn't have heard first hand accounts. But I would have thought in history lessons, or TV documentaries, somewhere I would have heard of this tale of extreme bravery and heroism. It is stories like these that make me proud to be an American and make me indebted to our men and women in the military.I don't remember hearing about this movie when it was released in the theaters, so it must not have gotten great press. I just happened to have caught it playing on AMC today, and I am glad I did. It really is a compelling story, although I know some license was taken with the romantic angle between the major and Margaret.The action was pretty intense and I have to say the shooting scenes were extremely realistic and graphic. It showed just how brutal the Japanese were in killing.The cast did a good job. Connie Nielsen was quite gripping in her depiction of Margaret. I did think Bratt looked a little young to be playing a Lt. Colonel. I liked the soft, muted colors of the cinematography as it gave the film a dated, historical look.",7,2,3,8 September 2008
Mystic River," Gut-wrenching
","I don't know how else to describe this movie other than gut-wrenching. This is a very difficult movie to watch, but I think it is extremely well made and delivered with brilliant performances. The subject matter is very heavy and is not a feel-good movie in the least.Clint Eastwood as director is a genius. I think this and 'Million Dollar Baby' are his crowning masterpieces. I think he gets better the older he gets. He certainly hasn't lost his touch.I think all the performances by the actors were spot on. Each one had me thoroughly convinced as to what they were feeling or experiencing. Total sincerity and genuineness in every character. I think besides Senn Penn, that Marcia Gay Harden's performance was stellar. Her obvious tortured conflict is so apparent, without being over the top. I was really disappointed that she didn't win for Best Supporting Actress, although she was nominated. Penn and Robbins definitely deserved their wins for Best Actor and Supporting Actor.If you haven't seen this, you have to check it out - a true masterpiece, but be ready for some gut-wrenching drama.",9,5,9,11 August 2008
Glory Road," Civil rights era sports movie
","It's unfortunate that there have been other similar stories to this that have already been told - for example, Remember THE TITANS. I think it makes this story less impactful since it feels like we sort of watched it before.But nonetheless, this was still a good movie with some good performances - especially Josh Lucas as the Coach. I think the players were all well cast and some even resembled the actual players - which was a nice touch.I think RTT did a better job in the script in creating a solid plot and interesting dialogue. But maybe again I'm not rating this as high since it appears to be a rehashing somewhat of the same themes in RTT. Also, RTT had Denzel Washington - and who can top that.I'm still appalled at this chapter of racism in our country's history and do think it is important to tell these stories - especially for the younger generation who either don't remember or it was before their time.To me, the most memorable line from the whole film is when the Asst. coach says something incredulous,to the effect that 'So you think the future of basketball is the black man?' - as though he was saying that could NEVER be possible! My how far we've come!",7,0,0,8 February 2009
Psycho," Definitely ahead of it's time, but pretty tame in modern times
","I just watched this with my 12 year old son last month on TCM. It's hard to believe but it is rated 'R' still now and I had to unblock parental controls to watch it with him. I am very strict in what I let my children watch so I hesitate to even call this a 'horror' picture, although it probably was in it's day.To me it is more a psychological thriller. There is no gore whatsoever - although I understand the audience of 1960 would find this much more disturbing as the movie industry had yet to mainstream the slasher flicks that predicated the 70's.Here are some observational details that help make this the masterpiece it was and still is:-I found the opening score to be a great stage setter as it had an anxiety provoking tone to it.<ul><li>Perkins is perfectly cast for the Norman Bates character. No one else could have pulled off this portrayal like him. Perkins is very creepy - but I always found him to be a human uncomfortable in his own skin, which apparently he was in real life.</li></ul><ul><li>To have the perceived 'main character' killed off early in the movie was unheard of. It caught the viewers especially off-guard.</li></ul><ul><li>The cinematography, especially the camera angles. There is something very uncomfortable in the filming that adds to the anxiety of what is going to happen next. For example, when Perkins is eating something in the hotel office and spins the hotel register around to read it, the camera shoots him under his chin while he is chewing. I'm not sure why, but it makes me uncomfortable. That is Hitchcock's genius in his direction and use of camera angles.</li></ul>If you haven't caught this masterpiece, you have to give yourself the pleasure of seeing Hitchcock at his best and why he was, and still is, the master of suspense!",8,0,1,20 July 2008
Man on Fire," Gritty and unnerving tale of revenge and redemption
","This movie is not for the queasy among us. There is quite a bit of violence in this picture - hence the R rating.I'm typically not a fan of movies that overdo violence - but make an exception if it is tied to a good story that seems to justify such a harsh reaction. Usually the way a movie gets the viewers sympathies is to tie it to an injustice to a child. Who among us doesn't detest the harming of a child. (In this case, I find it similar to another Denzel film, JOHN Q)Add to that a sympathetic anti-hero. A former special ops assassin in the character of John Creasy, played so beautifully by Denzel Washington. He has done such horrible things in his past that he resorts to drinking excessively to be able to live with himself. He takes the job as Pita's bodyguard almost unwillingly, but soon grows fond of her, in spite of his best efforts to remain detached. He is devastated when he fails to protect her and determines to seek revenge on all involved - and to at last redeem himself from his failures. Denzel has a unique ability to gain audience sympathies - he is the quintessential 'everyman' that we all can relate to. I'm not sure Tom Cruise or Bruce Willis ( all considered for the role) could have accomplished this nearly as successfully.I have to say the director did an amazing job of capturing the mood and atmosphere of the story and the time and the place. What stands out most is the cinematography that utilizes the hyper camera work - with the shaky, hand-held shots and the jumping cuts and editing. It keeps you on guard and not knowing what is going to happen next. It frames a world that is out of control and you feel it.I loved some of the dialogue and there are some great one-liners in this film: 'A bullet never lies - it always tells the truth'; 'Revenge is a meal best served cold'; 'Forgiveness is between them and God...My job is to arrange the meeting'; 'Creasy's art is death, and he is about to paint his masterpiece.'Dakota Fanning as Pita was simply amazing. The fact that she was only 9 at the time of filming blows my mind. She is quite a natural talent, and has proved she has staying power so far. She and Denzel shared a great chemistry between them.The music was a great addition to the film and had one of the most varied selections I've heard. Some of the more unusual choices was a Spanish version of 'Hey Mickey', Linda Ronstadt's 'Blue Bayou', as well as the beautifully haunting music that is the same as heard in 'Gladiator' by Lisa Gerrard. The classical pieces by Chopin and 'Claire de Lune' by Debussy were unusual choices but worked - I think it helped to give the movie a sympathetic heart to contrast with the violence. 'Una Palabra' was also a stand out piece and had an eerie and tragic sound - even though I couldn't understand a word.This is a movie that at times will not only saturate your senses, but also assault them. I guarantee it is not a film you will soon forget.",9,2,3,15 February 2009
Con Air," 'Why couldn't you put the bunny back in the box?!'
","I wish they could put this movie back in the box. This was a very crude and offensive movie. I watched it on TNT and even with some of the cuss words bleeped out, this movie obviously has to have used the f-word more than any other movie. I guess some film makers equate crude language with what makes a good action flick. There is also quite a few uses of the N-word as well.My other complaint is Nicholas Cage's horrendous southern accent. Being from the south, I don't think I have ever heard a more fake and overdone accent. I don't think anyone has talked that brand of southern accent since the Civil War. They could have easily made him from somewhere else in the U.S. without negatively impacting the story one bit. It would have been much better to have him in a believable speaking voice than a ridiculous one.Also, what was with the music?! I thought the electronic, synthesized background music went out with the 80's (a la 'Top Gun'). Yet this movie was made in 1997? For such a high budget film, you think they could have spent a little more on the music. Or maybe they spent ALL the money on stunts, explosions and special effects and couldn't afford to hire a decent music composer. It was the same ridiculous music throughout the whole movie.",4,2,4,28 December 2008
Signs," I love the way the story unfolds from master storyteller Shyamalan
","Unlike many modern movies that feel the need to spoon feed us info incessantly so that we 'get' the movie (either with constant narrating or infantile dialogue) - this movie keeps us guessing as what exactly happened in the past to cause Graham to give up being a priest. I much prefer to have things unfold slowly and allow viewers to discover the facts for themselves.I think Shyamalan is a master of suspense, similar to Hitchcock, which happens to be one of his idols. This film has so much tension, and yet Shyamalan also allows for moments of comic relief to break up this tension as well. He pays Hitchcock several compliments by copying some of his trademarks - such as making a cameo appearance in the film (although he is a horrible actor. He should do non-speaking cameo's like Hitch). He also uses similar camera techniques like extremely close shots and unusual camera angles and perspectives. There's also a big similarity to Hitchcock's 'The Birds' in the way that something is trying to get in the home and they have to board up all the doors and windows.Thia is one of the few 'scary' movies I let my kids watch. It has no blood and gore like the 'slasher' movies. It became an ongoing practical joke at my house where my husband would hide and make the alien 'clicking' noise - and my kids would just roar with laughter. (of course they would never admit it 'scared' them). I like that the film doesn't rely heavily on CGI or other special effects. It makes the film seem more realistic and believable, rather than the product of some big budget Hollywood production.I also like that the picture has a deeper meaning about whether we think we are alone, or believe that there are 'NO coincidences'.I think Gibson's performance was good, but I thought Joaquin Phoenix's was even better. His portrayal of 'akwardness' and the failings in his life are so palpable and believable. He seems to be more a 3rd child in the film than Graham's adult counterpart. I absolutely love the scene where he joins the 2 kids on the sofa with the aluminum foil hats. We laughed hysterically. Abigail Breslin's performance was amazing given her very young age - and is a testament to the skilled direction of Shyamalan.In addition to some comic relief, there are some tender moments - like when Graham relays the story of the kids birth to them at a very tense moment. I had tears in my eyes at how delicately and intimately Gibson delivers these lines - you forget that he's reciting lines and truly believe what he's saying.I loved the music score - especially the opening credits. It has a chaotic and tense melody. I think the accompanying graphics were cool as well. But the music is a very crucial part in the building of suspense. And the movie gets off to a fast start with the little girl screaming and also sets the stage for a fast pace in the rest of the film.Word of warning - I have caught this on TV and it is guilty of cutting out key scenes (must be in order to fit in time slot because there is nothing inappropriate about the cut scenes). So be sure to get the DVD so you don't miss anything.",9,0,4,19 January 2009
Rear Window," Classic Hitchcock Suspense!
","I have always been a huge fan of Hitchcok, after 1st seeing Dial M for Murder. Rear Window was probably the 2nd film of his I ever saw. I have since seen it probably 5-7 times and it never fails to keep my interest or cause me to see some new detail I missed before. I think that is the true measure of a Classic or Masterpiece, and this one certainly delivers! There are so many things going on in this movie, but most reviewers have touched on all of these so I won't add to them. But the plot is so superb in its layers of conflict, and studies in personalities of Stewart, Kelly, and all the neighbors. It is probably the best film for observing human nature at its many forms.I never realized how massive the set was until I dug a little further. They actually constructed the massive building in one sound stage. All the apartments in Burr's building had running water and electricity and could actually be lived in. Talk about realism and going the extra mile - but Hitchcock was all about that. All along I had assumed they had pieced the different scenes together to look like one building. At the time, it was the largest indoor set ever built by Paramount. While some may find the action a little slow as everything is filmed from the viewpoint of Stewart's apartment window, I find it amazing that the movie still creates such tension and suspense in spite of this.I think it is interesting that Spielberg is facing a lawsuit for his movie Disturbia which claims that it is basically a re-working of Rear Window. Why would anyone even attempt another telling of Hitchcock's perfectly done masterpiece, and especially without permission (even if your last name IS Spielberg)?",8,6,10,8 October 2008
Gladiator," One of the best movies I've seen - especially among modern films
","I typically prefer classic films because I, for one, don't think Hollywood makes movies like they used to. Plus, I think most modern films are heavy on the sex and foul language - and as a Christian, I find it offensive.So it is rare when Hollywood puts out not only a great film in terms of the quality of the story and the performances, but which also has very little language and no explicit sexual content (inspite of this being rated R but that is due to the violence).This movie did something that rarely happens with me in modern films in that it completely absorbed me into the time period, the location and the story. I felt somewhat transported for the entire length - which given its long running time, was quite a feat. It never once seemed to lag or get slow - but kept my complete attention. Not only that, but I have seen this film numerous times (probably at least 6 times) and it never fails to capture my complete attention - even though I know what is going to happen next. That is the sign of not only a great movie - but a MASTERPIECE in my opinion.Crowe's performance was amazing, but I'm a little surprised that he won, while Joaquin Phoenix was ROBBED. He was nominated, but lost to Benicio Del Torro for TRAFFIC. Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus was so completely engrossing - the creep factor was exponential. I think his is one of the all time great villainous portrayals - but in ways that at times were so subtle that it made him even more despicable.I only had one mild complaint of the film which is I felt the past history between Lucilla and Maximus was not completely explained and I think would have enriched the understanding of the 2 characters.I own very few DVD's but this is one that we did end up getting since it never fails to deliver a completely absorbing experience - time after time!",10,2,4,9 February 2009
The Birds," A little hokey for me - but it does make you wonder...!
","My overall impression of the movie is that it is , for lack of a better word, a little hokey. I found much of the plot and presentation unbelievable. And trust me, I am usually a big suspender of belief when watching movies. But somehow here, I found it a little more difficult.But don't get me wrong, I am a huge Hitchcock fan, and I do still like this movie, But I guess I have such high expectations for Hitchcock that this one comes up just a bit short, say a Vertigo, Rear Window or Psycho. But it is still a good movie, just not GREAT like I hoped.Tippi's character is a little too stalkish in the beginning, following Taylor to his hometown. Who would do this? Especially nowadays. And I guess I have never been a big Rod Taylor fan - he always seems a little neaderthal-ish Okay, enough of the negatives. I think the real beauty of the movie is that it takes something you never think of as a threat, i.e. birds, and suddenly has you thinking... 'It could happen?!...' So it succeeds in inspiring fear. I wonder if had the same effect on people back then, that Jaws had on my generation? But the ending fell flat for me. I see it was meant to leave you asking 'So what happens...?'. And it doesn't answer any of the why questions as to why it happened or will they go away.",7,2,4,7 July 2008
From Here to Eternity," I didn't like this as much as Oscar told me I should!
","This movie tied 'Gone with the Wind' (1939) for the most Oscars won by a single film up to that point in time -- eight. So, prior to seeing this, I had every idea it was going to be the masterpiece that an 8-time Oscar winning movie should be.But then after the conclusion, I was left saying 'Huh'? First, the ending made no sense to me at all - the conversation between the 2 women on the boat leaving the island. I have since learned from the message boards that there was a lot cut out from the book and they explained the book ending. Someone shouldn't have to have read the book to understand a movie's ending - it should be a self-contained complete story.Secondly, I went into movie believing it would be a gripping tale of the events of Pearl Harbor, only to see that the attack is relegated to the end of the movie, and then as only a side note. So really, this isn't as much a war movie as a melodramatic soap opera surrounding the people who just happen to be inconvenienced by the attack at the end. The attack itself lasts mere minutes and seems to trivialize the tragedy of it. I think our servicemen and women who actually experienced this deserved greater respect than that.I wasn't that impressed with Sinatra's performance either. His character died halfway into the movie - I just didn't see an Oscar caliber portrayal.But given all my reservations, there are some fine performances by the cast. Kerr, Lancatser and Clift's portrayals stand out the most to me. There is some beautiful cinematography, especially the infamous kissing scene on the beach. And to think it was originally scripted to have been a vertical (standing up) kiss!So, overall, this is still a movie worth seeing. Just go into with realistic expectations - that this really isn't so much a war movie as it is a soapy melodrama about people who just happen to be in the military.",7,8,12,27 July 2008
