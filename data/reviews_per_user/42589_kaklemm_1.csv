First Man," So boring I stopped watching to write this
","I don't know how you make such a gripping subject deadly dull, but they did it well. Overly indulgent directing and editing (he's a sad boring guy who doesn't like much of anyone...got it the first 6 interminable scenes). Ryan Gosling is so charismatic; that's fantastic acting to come off as such a stiff. The Queen of England is apparently much more emotional then Neil Armstrong's wife. So dull that the apex of the film has left me wanting to write a bad review instead of seeing what happens. Sad.",3,2,3,23 August 2019
