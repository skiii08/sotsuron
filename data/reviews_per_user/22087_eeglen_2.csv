The Monuments Men," U571 with artwork
","Once again the Americans save the world. Historically rubbish. Token nods to British involvement but in reality the actual WW2 was made up of equal numbers of US & British Officers. The script had no depth, the best line was perhaps Cate Blanchett telling Matt Damon his French language skills were bad (delivered in a stereotypical french accent. Indeed in every scene in France, the French characters clumsily signpost the move from French to English language.Weak storyline, with no real flow until perhaps the last half how by which time I was waiting for the film to end. Unbelievable, Cate Blanchett (attractive Parisienne character offers a night of fun & the Damon character turns her down).Overly sentimental with lots of squirmingly clumsy Nazi kicking and politically correct references.Bob Balaban, Bill Murray & Jean Dujardin were excellent but the rest lamentable especially Clooney & Damon. Half way in my wife & I looked at each other as if to say what a lot of rot, and it was. The subject matter is likely to attract people wanting just a little depth than this film offered.",4,1,4,22 February 2014
Skyfall," A worthy 50th anniversary bond
","Craig's Bond is gritty & serious, a more human bond than some of the previous incarnations. I found myself empathising with his weaknesses which I don't think I ever done with another Bond. Xavier Barden plays a wonderful Silva. A somewhat complex sexually ambivalent character, a bit hetero, a bit homosexual with a gilf oepidal complex thrown in. Silva has several chances to kill Bond & M but in the true tradition of Bond doesn't take the opportunity. On several occasions I found myself thinking about Dr Evil's plan to kill Powers with sharks & lasers strapped to their heads. Ralph Fiennes superbly plays an almost believable character which is somewhat of a novelty in a Bond film. The plot is a bit thin at times, the location scenes are good except for the subtitles telling the audience the name of the city. The finale is set up and it delivers well almost.",8,5,14,28 October 2012
