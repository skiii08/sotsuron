Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing and depressing yet Beautiful and Poetic
","during the duration of this film I had to pause it 10 times simply for the fact that I felt that I was going insane. This is hands down the most disturbing and depressing movie i've ever seen. But in a very beautiful and poetic way. Pain can be beautiful because it is human. I absolutely appreciated the non compromising attitude this director took with this movie, it never lets up, never lets you breathe, holds you under water and injects pain into your veins. If you watch this movie you will be affected. Unless you are seriously out of touch with artistic forms of expression. I appreciated how it affected me, I loved how sad it made me, because it was real, that was the story, it was sad, If they had all ended up on a beach in Jamaica at the end I would have felt cheated. I kept turning away, squirming in my seat, holding my hands over my mouth and biting my lip. At the end tears came, a constant flow of them, I felt so lost so depressed so pitiful for those characters. It was just brutally honest. This is what film is for, it is not a cheap, sensationalistic piece of crap that is usually used to bring forth emotion in people. It is completely and totally honest. And If you are fragile emotionally do not watch this film. Although to be honest, I am very fragile, I watched it alone and I found it made me stronger.On a final note I'd like to add that Ellen Burstyn not winning the Oscar is one of the biggest travesties of modern film. She played this character so brilliantly I had my jaw dropped any time she spoke, during one scene she rips your heart out about five times and beats it against the ground. She is so broken so torn. It was absolutely magnificent. I wish I could tell her that she deserved that Oscar more than that sappy sell out piece of crap that won instead.anyway,it made me completely uncomfortable and broken but I will appreciate that and adore this movie for the rest of my life, it is truly a beautiful film even for a girl who's favorite movie is Monty Python and the holy grail.",10,1,2,28 July 2005
Constantine," I think I'm going to kill myself....
","This movie is the equivalent of taking a really good train ride when all of a sudden it turns around and heads straight to crap-ville.for a while I thought this movie was good, then it started to get cheesy and around the time where Constantine flipped the devil off as he was floating to heaven, I started to wish someone would shoot me in the head. Apart from the fact that it is completely sacrilegious, and twists holy figures into evil wielding monsters, It takes every cheesy, lame direction you could take with this movie and goes there, at 100 miles per hour. I was truly disappointed. Half way through I said to myself 'this is a good flick' Then it started going downhill. cheesy one liners, predictability, and then awful chewing of gum instead of smoking at the end. COME ON. who directed this? No director with any sense of pride in his craft could look at the scene where Constantine flips off the devil and say 'yes, this is a good thing to do' 'it is not at all lame as hell' My mind just can't wrap around it. When this metaphorical building starting crumbling it fell down hard, and everywhere. Every character lost its initial charm and became one with the big pile of cheese this movie morphed into. The girl who played Angela was a good actress at least, and the director somewhat kept her integrity as a character, The rest of them were fed to the lame movie wolves. I'm sorry if you liked this film, I truly am, I don't want to be Capt.Negative over here. But honestly, even if you liked it, you have to admit, it got pretty corny at the end. It just frustrates me because it was going so well, if it was kept up until the end, this would be one of my favorites. Its just a waste of an awesome plot.Somebody doesn't have your back anymore? First of all, In this movie the devil never should have been shown. He is too evil, and is better left to the imagination. Now even if you try to attempt this, why in the name of all that is good would you have some balding middle aged man in a white suit play the devil? If it was this sort of movie all along OK, but it wasn't, it was great, and then this? And then to say that god 'had Gabriel's back' ARE YOU KIDDING ME? if you understand true integrity when it comes to film you will understand why this was a rape and pillage of a good thing.Again I'm sorry to the fans. Still I recommend it, just don't get your hopes up and prepare to be let down hard after a big build up.",5,0,3,14 August 2005
