Walk the Line," A flawed repeat of 'Ray'
","I have seen this movie about 20 other times with the slight difference that it was about another famous person. 'Ray' is the most recent example. Parallels were rampant. Let us compare 'Ray' and 'Walk the Line.' Ray Charles experienced a rather monotonous life sprinkled with a drug addiction and affairs. Johnny Cash did, too. Ray Charles had a brother that died, and he was partially responsible. Johnny Cash did, too. Ray Charles was a famous musician from the mid-20th century. Johnny Cash was, too. Another complaint has not to deal necessarily with the movie, but its matter. Why is it that the rich and famous tend to mess up otherwise ideal lives? The song 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' quite accurately depicts my feelings about this subject. That wasn't necessarily the fault of those involved in making the film, but it's still something that irritates me about the 'Walk the Line' and all of its copies. On the positive side, I must truly congratulate Reese Witherspoone on her terrific performance; I felt she did the best job. Phoenix followed behind for a close 2nd place. If you like biopics and/or are a Johnny Cash fan, you'd probably enjoy it. I'm not really either.",6,0,3,25 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat: Silly Movie-Going Experience for Make Entertainment of Audience
","Borat, Borat, Borat.You will either love this movie, or you'll hate it, but chances are you'll love it. If you're easily offended, you're then likely going to hate it, but you most likely just want to see a funny movie. And Borat is the movie for you! The movie follows Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) as he travels to the US from Kazakhstan in order to learn lessons for his country and make a documentary. But when he discovers Baywatch on TV, and more importantly Pamela Anderson, he sets out on an epic quest from NY to California (where Pearl Harbor and Texas are).The humor is what happens along the way. He purchases an ice cream truck for the trip, accidentally enters a Jewish-owned Bed and Breakfast (Borat is anti-semetic), consequently holding a cross and his money close as he speaks fearfully into the camera of how the clever, shapeshifting Jews attempted to poison him, and later buys a grizzly bear for protection after the traumatic experience.He eventually reaches LA to meet his elusive Pamela Anderson, and funniness ensues--I won't go into further specifics.This is a great movie and an intelligent movie. Don't get turned off thinking it's just stupid humor or just making exploitative comments about Jews for cheap laughs; nay, it goes as far as making a few sly insinuations about our own culture, insinuations we can learn from.But, it is first and foremost a funny movie. The funniest of the year, though admittedly there have not been that many funny movies... Nonetheless, you will find abundant helpings of humor at this movie. So go, unwind, laugh. Remember, it will make for benefit humor of you.",9,5,15,3 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Good, but M:I III doesn't stand up to its Predecessors
","Perhaps I'm a bit disappointed only because I've been waiting intently since 2000 for the third installment of the Mission: Impossible series, but JJ Abrams's version just doesn't seem to stand out against today's action movies as much as the first two did.The first stood out not so much as an action movie, but a cool spy movie with a few extremely memorable scenes that will never be forgotten (Cruise on the cable, the Chunnel scene, etc.). It had its own cool vibe going on.The second was Woo action, and boy howdy, did I love it. Sure, it wasn't the same M:I we were used to, but it worked. There were some real cool action scenes that still exist in my mind as some of my favorites (Biocyte Infiltration, Motorcycle chase, etc.). It had Woo written all over it, and was, in my opinion, the perfect model for what a brainless summer blockbuster should be.Now comes JJ Abrams's version that seems to be a bit more formulaic. There were definitely some cool action scenes (cars being blown up on a Chesapeake Bay bridge, a helicopter chase through windmills, etc.), but they, for the most part, didn't seem to really be... distinguishable.And the movie follows in that respect, too. At the moment, it all seemed like an exciting assault of the senses (critics say it like it's a bad thing), but later on, it's rather forgettable. And that's what makes me disappointed.If you're just out to see a good action movie and nothing more, you should be very pleased with this. However, if you're a die-hard M:I fan like myself, you might find yourself thinking at times that this is just an action movie that has a similar cast to the other M:I films, but not an actual M:I film itself. I guess, for me, it just didn't scream 'I AM MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE! I WILL FREAKING ROCK YOU!' as much as it said 'Hey, I'm a good action movie, but nothing you haven't already seen.' It's fun, but tragically, forgettable.",7,1,2,6 May 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Ultimatum Makes for a Good Action-Thriller
","I enjoyed The Bourne Identity thoroughly, but I was somewhat let down by its sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. Now, Supremacy director Paul Greengrass brings us the final film of the trilogy - The Bourne Ultimatum.Identity was cool because it introduced us to Jason Bourne. There were some great action sequences, notably an apartment fight and a car chase, and it played out like a good espionage/spy/international thriller flick.The second to me seemed like more of the same. Also, Doug Liman was replaced by Paul Greengrass. I have the utmost respect for Greengrass, but I didn't like all the shakiness utilized in the cinematography that he's kind of known for. Shaky camera is distracting, and why do you want a distraction from a well choreographed fight scene or car chase or whatever? And it didn't seem like all that much had been accomplished - the movie essentially ended where it started.Then we come to Ultimatum. Greengrass is back for this one, and there's still some of that shaky camera, but it's less distracting than in Supremacy; I think this can be attributed to the fact that there's less of it and that there's more flair in the action scenes. Speaking of action scenes, Ultimatum has one of the best fights I've ever seen. Think of the bathroom brawl at the start of Casino Royale extended for several minutes. It's pretty cool. There's also a decent car chase, ending in a great crash, but it's not as exciting now since these have become typical occurrences in the Bourne movies.Unlike Supremacy, however, Ultimatum does advance the storyline of the Bourne universe. In fact, the biggest development in the whole trilogy probably happens at the end of this one.Overall, it was a pretty good summer flick, much more intelligent than the Hollywood fare we've enjoyed thus far, this summer. A little sophistication is nice after the likes of Shrek 3 (ugh), Transformers, and Rise of the Silver Surfer. Still, I think the action could have been a little more streamlined and the whole movie in general a little more enthralling. But I won't complain. It's definitely one of the best movies I've seen this summer, probably even the past couple of summers. Bourne fans won't be disappointed.I give it a 7.7/10.",7,1,2,5 August 2007
The Transporter," One of my all-time favorites of the Action genre
","Where to start......The Transporter starts out with a spectacular car chase through Monaco. Statham (this is the first film I saw him in; he's now one of my favorite actors) dazzles the screen as the amazing driver of the BMW right from this opening.I could talk about character development (and there is some on Frank's, Statham's character's, part), acting (and it was decent), et cetera, but in all honesty, that's not what this film is about. This is about having fun, watching some amazing martial arts, and viewing some great driving. Not to say that it totally relies on action (I absolutely loathe xXx for everything it represents), just that the action scenes are simply the highlights of the film.And that's why this is one of my favorite action films. The martial arts were some of the best I've seen. Though they may not have been all entirely believable (well, this is an action film), they were always at least possible (versus something like The Matrix). And they were great eye-candy. The martial arts also utilized many things that haven't been in past martial arts flicks (ex: fighting in oil, thus much slipping around, etc). Basically, action = good.The action direction that Corey Yuen contributes gives John Woo a run for his money. The cinematography seemed to always provide a clean, crisp French Riviera sunshine that gave a vibe of energy and excitement (and aesthetic appeal). Fight scenes were never hard to follow, and always fun to watch. Car chases were beautiful. I don't know if I've said it yet, but this is a great action film! It's never too over-the-top, and it's not totally non-stop action, so the action that is provided is boosted that much more. A must-see for action-buffs, Statham fans, or Shi Qu fans, this is one of the most recent cult films I know of.",8,4,4,21 February 2006
Mission: Impossible II," The Citizen Kane of Action Films!
","M:I 2 is the Citizen Kane of action films.I've heard a lot of bad-mouthing this movie, so hear me out on why it is good. Why it's great, in fact.CINEMATOGRAPHY Shots were beautifully colored in this film. Australia was bright and cheery. The Southwest's red land contrasts beautifully with the blue sky. The red-tainted Outback is that much better in the midst of a blood-red sunset. Biocyte's lab is a visual monotone of cool colors, which later pose a stark difference to sparks and explosions. M:I 2 had beautiful cinematography.PLOT I really don't follow why so many claim the plot is bad. It's certainly not as convoluted as the first, but I think that that's for the better. People speak of plot holes, but I didn't see any (nothing major, anyway). The premise was certainly more intelligent than, say, Die Hard (yippy-kay-yay, let's go kill all the motherfu**ers). It's not Syriana, but hey.ACTING There seems to be a rule in action movies that actors can't act. Now, performances weren't quite Oscar-worthy here, but this movie was really an exception to that rule. Dougray was menacing, a truly great villain. I don't think Cruise has ever let me down in the acting department. Thandie Newton was GREAT in that she wasn't the female just thrown in for the love story; she was a real person, darnit!, and she had emotions and facial expressions and wasn't just there to have sex! I mean, some have called the acting wooden, but I'll take this over Vin Diesel's monotone expression in xXx any day.DIRECTION/EDITING Very well done. M:I 2 doesn't suffer from quick cuts like so many other modern action films do. It succeeds brilliantly in its camera-work, allowing us to always understand what's going on, and giving us some very eye-pleasing shots in the process. Scenes inter-cut with each other (Cruise going into Biocyte/Ambrose explaining what he'll do, Cruise in motorcycle chase/Newton on bluff, etc.) were done not only so they wouldn't subtract from each other, but so that they complement each other and give us the bigger picture in a very well-done way.SCORE Yay for Hans Zimmer! Along with what many deem a genre change (btw, many seem to have a problem with this. I personally don't, and if you do, I'd simply ask you to go along with it. If you still disapprove, well, sorry.), Zimmer changed the theme from a more spyish tune to a much more actionesque theme that perfectly reflected the mood and genre of M:I 2. Also, 'Injection,' the song played at the end of Biocyte Infiltration when Cruise jumps out of the building, is my favorite action song. It's a beautiful song, with vocals, strings, a drum, and if I'm not mistaken, some synth, too. It's a very 'deep' song, perfect for a stylistic action scene that ended up being Biocyte Infiltration. It's doesn't bang you over the head with 'I'M HEAVY-METAL ACTION MUSIC!!!' but is a soothing, ear-pleasing piece of art (yes, ART!), that adds emotion when needed, suspense when needed, and complements what is being shown PERFECTLY. Yay for Hans Zimmer.ACTION (ACTION!) Action is undoubtedly this film's biggest selling point. Some call it over-the-top, and it is, but it's nowhere near as bad as something like xXx. Also, everything shown is, though very improbable, at least possible (you've beaten out a lot of action movies, now, already). On top of that, it was AMAZING! Slo-mo when needed to add stylistic depth to Cruise running through a shot-up corridor towards an anonymous light source of hope as sparks soar through the air; a knife driving down atop Cruise's face, stopping abruptly mere MILLIMETERS from his eye (and, btw, this was done w/ Cruise for real; no special effects); Cruise lifting the rear end of his motorcycle up as a car hood passes underneath it, swinging his pistol around to shoot the gas tank of the previously mentioned car until it blows up and rolls very eye-pleasingly, etc, etc. (Actually, I think myth busters proved you can't blow up a car by shooting its gas tank, so I'll give you that; still, its a very minute detail and worth it for a very insane shot). This action is way up there, giving movies like The Matrix a run for their money.CONCLUSION M:I 2 is done so well in so many aspects that I really don't feel it should be written off as a stupid, over-the-top action movie. I mean, how many action movies in the following six years can compare in action OR plot? I think you'd run out of films before you'd get to the end of your fingers. Even if you included every action movie before it, I'd think you'd be hard-pressed to find a large number. Certainly, M:I 2 deserves more than its current 5.7 rating.",10,2,4,24 August 2006
Blood Diamond," Pretty Good, Not Quite Great
","For your information, this review contains mild spoilers of the film's storyline.Blood Diamond had a lot of potential. It had opportunities for action, compelling situations, compelling characters, etc, but it didn't seem to fully realize them.There were plenty of moments of action, but they seemed to always be filmed with a shaky camera and quick cuts. Sure, that might make it seem more like you're there, but it got pretty old pretty fast. The audience began to not know what was going on or where the main characters were or where the bad guys were. This really subtracted from several scenes that could have been very memorable, like a rebel invasion of Sierra Leone's capital city Freetown.Much of the movie revolved around the rebel forces of the RUF in Sierra Leone, who kidnapped the son of Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou). Solomon is then taken prisoner by the RUF and forced to dig up diamonds. South African smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio, now surely one of the best actors, not only of his generation, but in moviedom today) learns of a diamond worth quite a bit of money that Solomon had found, and most of the movie follows Solomon as he searches for his family and Archer as he searches for the diamond. Archer tells Solomon with the money they could make with the diamond, finding his family would be a breeze, so they stick together. Reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) hooks up with the pair upon learning of Archer's connections to conflict diamond corporations and their important people. Wanting to really help the victims of the conflict, Maddy helps Solomon and Archer on their quests so that she can get information on the conflict diamond dealers and take them down.Solomon's son is forced to fight for the RUF, and becomes a completely desensitized, killing machine. This could have been very, very powerful, but it wasn't quite as heart-wrenching as it could have been. It does, however, provide for a great, gut-wrenching moment of tension later in the film. Solomon himself is played well. Hounsou plays him with a sense of innocence, and we do care about him and his journey to find his family. Connelly, too, is an idealistic journalist who wants to help the world, and we come to believe that her well-intentioned motivations are completely genuine. DiCaprio, as always, is terrific. I'm not completely sure what a South African accent should sound like, but his seemed convincing enough to me. He is a man on a mission, and we believe it. It was especially a treat to see his character develop. The best thing about Archer's development is that, while he goes from being selfish to selfless, it's not unbelievable or clichéd. He doesn't just become a good guy, he convincingly transforms from (a closet racist) anti-hero to hero. All around good and great acting in Blood Diamond.The end concludes with a political message somewhere along the lines of Lord of War, which kind of killed the mood, but it's certainly nice that the movie is actually about something important (i.e. conflict in Africa that, according to Maddy, we might catch on the news somewhere 'between sports and weather').Blood Diamond is done well, but not quite as well as it could have been. Still, it made for a good movie, one of the better of 2006, and I'm glad I saw it.8/10",8,11,19,3 December 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Good Movie, Engrossing Movie
","I haven't read the book, but I've heard good things. Tom Hanks and Ron Howard seem like a great movie-making combination... I was looking forward to this.Having not read the book, I wasn't quite sure what to expect; however, from the opening murder in The Louvre, to brief discussions of Christian dogma, to Hanks telling stories about secret societies, I was utterly engrossed. Hanks seems to, as usual, be hypnotizing in his lead role. Audrey Tatou, playing the lead counterpart to Hanks, isn't quite Oscar-worthy here, but she does a pretty decent job. The real scene stealer is Paul Bettany, playing the most engrossing character of the movie, Silas. Jean Reno also lends his talent to the film, though he's not fully utilized.Ron Howard is undoubtedly one of today's greatest directors, and he works his magic here quite well. Scenes are beautifully shot, pacing is great, and everything related to the director is top-notch. Kudos to Ronny H. here.I can't comment on the story in comparison to the book, but as a newcomer, it was quite good. The mix of action here, dialogue there, and a theological background all over is quite good. Is it better or worse than the book? I can't say, but if it's worse than the book, I wouldn't imagine it would be by that much.",7,2,4,25 May 2006
The Departed," This was... AWESOME
","Whoa. What an experience.Crisp direction heads this wonderfully written film, with tid bits of humor scattered throughout (and, fortunately, it helps make the movie, rather than subtract from it). Other moments are tense, exhausting, absorbing... Very well-written.Acting is also top-notch. I could see any one of many actors from The Departed being nominated for an Academy Award. DiCaprio and Nicholson are especially great here, giving some of the best performances of their careers. Gotta mention Wahlburg, too--he's a lot of fun to watch.Note that the film has quite a bit of profanity and a decent amount of violence. Still, I'd strongly encourage you to not let this deter you. The experience is completely and utterly worth it.SEE THIS FILM!",10,2,4,7 October 2006
Munich," An Array of philosophical and emotional Thought
","5 hours later, I'm still tense. I'm physically exhausted. My body and my mind both ache. Munich has this effect not merely by being a thriller, but through its messages. In fact, I'd say it's more the latter.It's plot serves three purposes. First, it discusses the conflict that seems to perpetually surround Israel and Palestine. Second, it acts as a character study, one that examines what a man should fight for, and what this fighting can cause. Lastly, it addresses what loyalty truly is.Plot point one: Though Roger Ebert seemed to feel that Munich was only a film that gave facts that the audience was supposed to draw a conclusion from, and despite the fact that Munich's director, Steven Spielberg, said he thinks there will be peace in the Middle East in his lifetime, I felt that the movie really suggested peace is going to take a very long time to arrive in the region. The picture's protagonist, Avner, boldly states this once his experience has ended. Though I'm getting a mixed message from what the movie said and what Spielberg said, I think that, unfortunately, the movie's message is accurate. Considering that many Muslims feel Israel belongs to them, there's going to inevitably be trouble.Israeli Jews aren't going to give up their land anytime soon, either. In this day and age, Israel represents Judaism. It's what the Jews have, after the many centuries following the Diaspora.This sets up a conflict that won't end any time soon, and I think that Munich realizes this. There is no inspirational ending, just a realistic one.Plot point 2: Avner is the leader of an assassination squad, sent by Israel to take out those responsible for the Munich attacks. In a nutshell, the killing takes a toll on him. We've seen the James Bond movies where Bond kills, kills, sleeps with women, and kills some more. Though Avner kills, too, he makes Bond look like a sick, sadistic madman, completely indifferent to taking human life. This is because Avner experiences something that puts guilt forever upon his shoulders. One might wonder why this is a significant part of the story; it's not like normal people have to deal with that. Well, I, for one, have to choose a career quite soon; I've often considered the military. I don't think that I'll take this path precisely because of what Avner experiences. In fact, even if one isn't actually killing in the military, or even in the military at all, he or she still supports it. This indirectly supports the killing. I'm not saying war is bad, as I feel it is sometimes necessary. But it will inevitably have this effect on all who take part, and the motive for going to war must outweigh this. Munich asks if fighting over Israel outweighs this, and that leads me to my next and final point.Plot point 3: I'm not trying to get all political here, but the movie even applies to things like the current war in Iraq. Now I admit that some soldiers will never see direct conflict, but a surprisingly large amount do. Is their desensitization worth fighting in Iraq? I'm not saying it isn't, because maybe it is. Nor am I saying that it is, because maybe it isn't. We have to decide for ourselves on that issue. The movie also shows Avner becoming less patriotic to Israel because he doesn't feel his actions are justified or necessary. An Israeli government official subtly criticizes him for this at the end. This parallels a lot of debate today in the U.S. Are people who criticize the war in Iraq unpatriotic? The movie implies that they are not unpatriotic, that they simply wish to improve the place they love.I dislike addressing politics in manners like I just did because I know that it will inevitably stir up controversy, that some people might say that this review was helpful to them because they agreed with it, and that some might say it was not helpful because they disagreed with it. The same support (or lack of it) will go to this film for the same reasons. Though it is mostly a politically neutral film (finally), there are very slight leanings to the left side. I am slightly on the other side of the dividing line, yet this movie still spoke to me with many powerful messages. And I respect it for that.",10,0,1,21 January 2006
300," Orgasmic
","300 is a plethora of awesomeness. Awesomeness that only magnificent testosterone-driven battle scenes can deliver. And deliver they did! Oh, how the blood and limbs fly! I'm not a sadistic violence-loving fan of Hostel or anything, but while watching 300 I was constantly bloodthirsty for more. More of that awesome regular-mo/slow-mo Persian ass-kicking that Gerard Butler proved to be great at. Every battle scene was a superb montage of blood and guts, interlaced with Persians falling off cliffs and Butler and company shouting chilling battle chants.300's cinematography was dazzling, although much of this was more post-production work than camera work. Nonetheless, Sparta, wilderness, and the 'Hot Gates' are all mesmerizing to look at: think a talented artist's depiction combined with realistic CGI to create surreal dreamscapes of an epic scale.Undoubtedly, this film's selling point is its monumental action sequences, but I have to credit the acting of both Gerard Butler and Lena Headey, here, too. Butler, who I haven't really noticed before, is now at the forefront of my favorite actors. He's intense, serious, and unflinchingly awesome as King Leonidas. If I was ever to go into battle, I'd be happy to have him there. His character's wife, played by Lena Headey, was also terrific. Women tend to take the backseat in movies like this, but she played her character with strength and conviction, allowing her to shine in several of her scenes.I was drooling for most of this movie. It was just so utterly amazing in a number of ways, especially, again, in its battle scenes. I'm confident that this movie will be received well for years to come, that it will age like fine wine. Red wine, if you catch my drift...",10,5,11,10 March 2007
The Thin Red Line," Sorry, didn't do it for me
","I was excited to see this. I think I heard somewhere that Scorsese called it the best movie of the 90's. I'm not sure whether that's true, but it got me fired up. Other people said good things. It was like post-release hype.Okay, well, I put this baby in the DVD player and let 'er rip. But, she really didn't rip.It started out with Caviezel (he's still relatively unknown, unfortunately, even after a bunch of big films) AWOL on an island of indigenous peoples he likes for their innocence. Then a ship comes and picks him up, and Sean Penn yells at him. They have this relationship throughout the movie.Caviezel doesn't like war, so the writer seemed to figure: 'let's have him say poetic-sounding things while we show shots of nature - people will think it's deep.' Okay, well, I'd say about an hour of the 2 hour 40 minute movie is dedicated to this voice-over narration. It gets old. Quickly.The film's story revolves around taking control of a Japanese controlled island in the Pacific. There are some battle scenes that are expertly done. These are definitely the strong points of the movie. I think that if they had focused more on these and done more of a 'Black Hawk Down' approach, this would have been a tremendous film. But of course, we had to make it anti-war. Aside from that being pretty clichéd at this point, it wasn't handled all that well. A friend of mine told me that he didn't care for this movie, citing his opinion that 'it was boring - war films shouldn't be boring.' I'm not saying that it should have to be a blood-filled gore fest of testosterone-inducing violence, I can appreciate slower, thoughtful films, but, with the exception of about 15 minutes of intense battle scenes, this really was just... boring.The acting was fine. Nolte is definitely a strong point, and Caviezel is fine. Brody isn't given much to do, though, and Travolta has only about 3 minutes of screen time. Clooney has even less.I suppose that this film is 'technically' good, as in acting, cinematography, etc, are all fine, but I think that the issue came in the editing process. They made it way too long , and they focused on all the wrong things. I don't see war films to see shots of nature, I see them because they should be compelling, they should have action, and they should definitely not be boring. Sorry, But I don't think that The Thin Red Line meets these criteria.",6,2,4,3 March 2007
