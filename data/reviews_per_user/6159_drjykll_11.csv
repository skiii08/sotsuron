Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," the force is strong with this one!
","fantastic! I've been to this flick three times now, and can't wait for the fourth. Not the best of the series, but still on its own is pure star wars! Believe the hype!  One more thing...long live Darth Maul!",Null,0,0,23 May 1999
Alien: Resurrection," no Giger credits?
","hi, i'm gonna talk about alien 4 today, this isn't that bad..there is some sense of a plot, (with a lil hint of Call as a terroist) but after they make their point...all it is a basic 'runaway' movie, true, Weaver is the only thing that saved it from being a little boring. But, it didn't ruin the series i don't think. I had some fun with the effects. But one very IMPORTANT thing about the ALIEN series...was H.r. Giger's designs..strongest in the 1st, and most true to his design,  ALIENS changed the design a lil for camerons liking..but still gave him credit, just like ALIEN3 H.r. Giger got credit even tho' he didn't have input at all. Now...the fourth film in the series, is VERY close designs to the 1st film...but NO credit to the artist who orignally created the infamous creature. that upset me more than the plot in this movie is how one person who's been a part of the series from the beginning...gets no credit.  watch the credits in ALL 4 and you'll see my point",Null,0,0,19 February 1999
The Mummy," Mumm-a-rific!
","The Mummy! This flick was excellent, i was waiting for it since i heard rumors last summer, and havent stopped raving. Just plain fun. Great effects and an easy but not simple plot. Can't wait to see it again, can't wait to get it on tape...can't wait for the sequel! Not many people have been talking about the actual performance of the Mummy himself..but he was top notch. The faces he made was great and he just looked spooky and that Egyptian talk made him all even cooler. I really recommend this one.",Null,0,0,2 June 1999
Ed Wood," fantastic work of film
",I'd just like to say how much i enjoy this movie.  it's such a touching story about Ed Wood and his passion for making the 'great' horror film and about bela lugosi's sad ending months of his life. truly amazing performances in the whole film. one of Tim Burtons best works.  4 stars definitely worth seeing.,Null,0,0,12 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," the end....
","Great scenes, and it's like the whole Star Wars family/gang/crew is along having fun with you. And a story book ending...Return of the Jedi is a great work of film.",Null,0,0,14 March 1999
LÃ©on: The Professional," wickedly brilliant
","This movie made me a big Jean Reno fan, and I've been following him ever since this film.  This film's got such style and grace to it, even though it's violent and the themes are different. I believe this story is a love story as well as an action film. Great piece of work that's really worth seeing.",Null,0,1,1 April 1999
Edward Scissorhands," one of my favorite films of all time
","ok, edward sissorhands. this has to be one of my favorite films of all time...i think it's a modern frankenstien with a twist.  ok ok, it's not ALL that orignal...ok ok it was a 'sad' ending..ok ok..blah blah blah..that's what ive been reading in all the other reviews. Who says this needed a happy ending? Who said it wasn't a happy ending? come on! it's the story i love that goes across..being different and misunderstood. and if you can't see that because they weren't together in the end(depp and ryder), you're missing the point. yeah it is true that the contrast in sides was a little to direct but thats just how burton wanted it. As for it being original? Find me a movie that hasnt taken an idea....'Romeo Juliet' wasn't even original. Prymus and Thisbe ring a bell? Its an old story with a new twist seen thru a different set of eyes.Maybe i'm just partial to Tim Burton but i strongly recommend this film...and if you want happy endings rent some disney movies.",Null,0,0,18 January 1999
Event Horizon," big on gore shock, low on fear shock
","Saw this one when it came out, at first I was really impressed with the sets, the concept and how scary it was. But after seeing it on cable a few times....it just seemed less original. It borrows alot from other sci-fi flicks (Alien, Hellraiser). But Fishburne's acting saved this film from becoming typical gory sci-fi shlock.",Null,0,0,24 May 1999
Scream 2," just a gory episode of scooby doo
","ugh..predictable from the start, the only 'fun' i had was seeing how/where the characters were in their lives. but other than that a bloody version of a bad scooby doo episode with david arquette as shaggy.  Very disappointing.",Null,0,0,16 March 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," what the silver screen was made for
","i'm not going to give you the plot or characters, if you don't know who Chewbacca is...you shouldn't be reading this go to a video store and fast. Star wars! come on, what else is there to say...i grew up on this movie and each time i see it takes me right back there with all my figures and the mania along with it. this movie is what the big screen was meant for...a must see in the theaters. the only true way to see it, and if you missed the re-release...you missed a once in a lifetime chance. this movie is pure fun for everybody, kids adults..who can't point out darth vader (still one of the most recognizable villains in movie history.)  one of my all time favs..star was is a must see, must buy, must repeat the lines in public, must make the lightsaber noise...",Null,0,0,11 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," fantastic
","Rather then going into how good this film is, I'd like to mention how great a SEQUEL it is, what a great way to set up the 3rd film, this is when sequels were good. If there's a movie better than Star Wars....this one's it, it's perfect.",Null,0,0,14 March 1999
