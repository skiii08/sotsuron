Blade Runner 2049," This sequel will spoil the original. A waste of time.
","Films like these makes me wonder and think that some producers are 3 year old kids who are in love with sponge bob and have not seen a decent movie in all their lives. Why would anybody put two dollar together to produce such a nonsense. there is no story, the characteres are not relateable, it could have been made into a 20 minutes short.",2,4,8,25 March 2018
Coraline," great animation, no story
",There are no words to praise the artists enough however it was all in vain because it is a collection of strange different creatures serving to a movie without story. It takes you half of the movie to figure out that it would probably take you and Coraline nowhere. when you are eager to know the purpose of it all the director takes you to useless chases and after a gross scene of old lady with bare BIG boobs there you find the very ugly skinny mother who wants to put buttons on her kid's eyes. I had lots of fun enjoying the making of the puppets and movie. Great art direction. Great soundtrack. Some changes between scenes are just amazing but none of the amazing animation could stop me from being bored with the lack of sense and story. If it was bases on Alice it was very badly made. If it is any consolation I also did not like Tim Burton's Alice.,6,1,4,12 March 2012
Bridesmaids," sickly sad never a comedy!
","I have to confess that I was very exited about watching this movie so you can imagine my surprise that the movie starts and continues with women feeling sorry for themselves and complaining about everything under the sun. During the whole movie I had a feeling of running away. In few occasions where a joke was presented, it was of such bad taste that makes you cringe. Horror: Sharknado is much better that this. Imagine 'The Hangover' with 'The Inbetweeners' characters transformed into female characters and bitching right left and centre, having rows with each other. There is not a single line, scene or emotion you could extract from this movie. I am always appalled by what goes in the producers minds when they decide to spend millions of dollar in such rubbish! Couldn't they see that it is a bunch of garbage with some not so bad looking actresses and scenery! Runaway! I mean, The runaway bride is much better (even though I'd score it 6).",1,2,3,12 November 2015
Get Out," copy of stepford boyfriends
","The clue is in the mane. Unfortubatelly we end up not getting it and one hour later we understand that the writing was on the wall and we had refused to read.
Film production has been so low that recently there are 2 or 3 good movies to watch every year only.

La La Land," waste of time and money
","Films like these makes me wonder and think that some producers are 3 year old kids who are in love with sponge bob and have not seen a decent movie in all their lives. Why would anybody put two dollar together to produce such a nonsense. there is no story, there are no good songs, the actors can barely sing a lullaby,",1,1,5,25 March 2018
Black Panther," Give me something black.
","Seems that some producer requested something black and this is what they came about! Horrible movie, very difficult to understand the dialogues because it was decided to use an accent. Why accent? Or use some African language and stick subtitles or go totally in English. I've spent 40 minutes trying to get some plot, some story, that's when I realised that only them the movie was starting... and what a joke it is. If I were an African descendent I would be offended for using this rubbish to praise the Color. Another joke is Hollywood put this in the list of the best. Disgraceful.",2,10,16,24 February 2019
