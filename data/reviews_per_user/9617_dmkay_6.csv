The Ring," scariest movie since re-release of The Exocist
","I am amazed at the number of people on this site who apparently did not find this movie to be scary.  Everyone in the theater I saw it was was completely horror-struck, as was I, and I've seen plenty of horror movies.  I would honestly say this is one of the 10 scariest movies ever released in an American theater, and the scariest I've seen since The Exocist was re-released.  As for the Japanese original, I've never seen or heard of it and I doubt many other Americans have either, but I'll definitely try to seek it out now.",9,2,2,18 October 2002
Dawn of the Dead," Dreadful Dawn
","I'm not completely against remakes.  They can be good, like The Thing or The Fly, or they can be OK, like last year's Texas Chainsaw.  This one, Dawn of the Dead 2004, is one of the most unholy God-awful piece of s**t remakes I've ever seen.  None of the humor, social commentary, sense of dread or awe or loneliness that made the original so great is present here.  The characters are the kind of stupid idiots usually found in a Friday the 13th film, who go wandering off by themselves to investigate noises totally unarmed.  It takes them way too long to realize how zomibifaction (?) is spread, and they fail to take simple obvious precautions that anyone would take.  The mall fails to feel like a real place, partly because we never get a sense of its size like we did in the original.  This is really just an inferior version of 28 Days Later set in a mall.I'm giving this 3 out of 10.  I'll give it higher than a 1 just for the scenes involving Andy (the rooftop neighbor) which are clever and give us some trace of the original's charm.  Plus, the early scenes where everything starts to go to hell are done well.  Otherwise, this stinking zombie pile smells even worse than Resident Evil, and that's pretty bad.",3,0,1,21 March 2004
Alien vs. Predator," The pits...
","Ah, what might have been.  AvP has to be one of my personally most anticipated movies ever.  And it's one of the most disappointing.  The problems with this movie are legion:SPOILERS1) It's only 87 minutes long, and at least half that time is wasted on a boring setup that is neither believable nor entertaining.  The pace increases once the title characters FINALLY meet up, but by then there's only about half an hour left in the film.2) The rules of the two series are monkeyed with.  Predators are only supposed to visit earth where it's very hot, as established in the first two Predator movies.  So where is this one set?  The South Pole, naturally.  The time an alien takes to gestate in a human was at least a day or two in 'Alien,' but in AvP it only takes a few minutes.  And the alien blood apparently burns through the Predator's wrist blades and armor, but not their spears.3) Certain scenes have either no setup or no payoff.  For example, when the Predators first kill humans, the scene starts with a human waving his green laser-sighted pistol around for no apparent reason.  This scene comes out of nowhere.  For a bit with no payoff, consider the creation of the 'netted' alien character...it's seen twice, at least, and seems to be set up as identifiable for a reason...but nothing ever happens to that particular alien worth noting.  It's as if that alien was set up to do something special and then had its payoff scene cut out.  Another curious bit: Why did the lead African-American character and his buddies bring assault rifles? It seemed at first like they must have planned to capture/kill an alien, but nothing ever comes of that.Positives:1) There are some kick-ass Predator scenes.  And the idea of Predators using alien blood to mark themselves is cool.  The effects are OK.  But that's about it.",4,0,0,14 August 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Exquisite, astounding, compelling, but...
","...there's something not quite perfect about Kill Bill.  For the first hour I went back and forth between liking it and not liking it, especially between the first fight scene (which is wonderful, especially when the school bus appears) and the anime sequence.  The movie is missing something in that space...maybe it's too slowly paced, or takes too much time explaining a plot that is so simple it could be explained in 5 seconds.But starting with the anime sequence, Kill Bill was unflappable.  So much of this film is a homage to other films, and yet it manages to be one of the most original films I've seen in years.  The images and music in some scenes, such as the final swordfight in the snow, are simply beautiful. Exquisite, even.  And even the minor characters, such as the sushi chef and the Texas sheriff, are interesting people you want to know more about. 
It IS violent and bloody.  Most of the blood is so over-the-top, it's just a geyser of red and not very disturbing.  But some of it IS disturbing, and although I've seen much more gory movies like Dead Alive/Braindead and Day of the Dead, I actually wish Kill Bill had toned it down a touch.  It's so bloody that many people have focused only on that aspect of the film, which is a shame.Kill Bill has moments that are among the best ever filmed, but I don't think the film as a whole is as good as Pulp Fiction.  I give it 9/10.",10,0,1,19 October 2003
Titanic," why do so many hate this movie?
","Someone needs to write a dissertation on the audience reaction to this movie.  When it came out, almost everyone loved it and many people saw it multiple times, yet after it won the Oscars, suddenly you weren't cool unless you hated Titanic with a passion.  I don't understand this at all. Maybe it was too successful for its own good, or maybe it was just Cameron's a-hole acceptance speech, but the way the audience has flip-floped on this film is amazing.  Personally, I think it's a great movie.  The dialogue is bad, but otherwise there's nothing terrible about it.  If you don't like it, I can see rating it at 6 or so, but how could over 7,000 people truly believe Titanic deserves a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10?  I mean, COME ON!",9,2,5,13 April 2003
Signs," Intense, terrific suspense thriller
","Along with Alien and The Thing, Signs deserves to be considered one of the scariest alien films of all time.  The best thing about Signs is its intensity...this movie builds suspense smoothly and steadily, never letting up for a minute.  Unlike many films, there are almost no 'filler' scenes here.  You're glued to your seat the entire time.  Sound and bare glimpses of the aliens are used to great effect.  The film feels real, the characters believable.  Some don't like the kids, but I think they're both great...although the girl is better than the boy, who is a little too much like the smart little boy in Sixth Sense (a movie I didn't like as well as Signs).The only drawback to Signs is the ending...which I think is a little silly but doesn't ruin an otherwise great film.  And yes, Signs does have more than its fair share of haters, just like The Ring (another very scary film), probably due to some people's habit of hating very good films that are also very popular (think Titanic).  The only people who could truly hate Signs are people who think movies are supposed to be an intellectual experience rather than an emotional one.  10 out of 10.",10,0,3,11 February 2004
