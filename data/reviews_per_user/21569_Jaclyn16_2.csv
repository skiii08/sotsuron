The King's Speech," Masterful
","Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, with admirable support from Helena Bonham Carter lead this wonderful historic record with breathtaking ease. The characterisation, understated portrayals and absolute grasp of their craft offers an incite into a world that has only been guessed at.Rush is superb, Firth masterful and with the delightful and wonderfully rounded balance of Helena Bonham Carter - I was absolutely captivated for the entire movie. Dealing with a stammer/stutter in the present day is a difficult proposition - back then, with a country on the verge of conflict and a more innocent age - it must have been crippling. This movie is why I watch films of this kind - I was given such a stimulating experience and marvelled at the direction, performances and historical content I felt educated as well as entertained.Thanks to the production, which was flawless - the direction which allowed the film to flow and each and every person who worked on this masterpiece of story telling. Brilliant!",10,0,1,2 February 2011
The Avengers," The Greatest Action Adventure Movie EVER!
","I am unsure if words could describe how enthusiastic I was about this movie - I do not go to the cinema for many reasons, but for this, I went twice. The cast are more than super heroes, they are astoundingly brilliant at portraying the fear, anxiety, arrogance, and sheer audacity of these Marvel Cartoon heroes - the plot is steady throughout and the reveals are amazing - I won't even try to describe the SFX because they cannot properly be adequately descriptive enough - SEE IT! The sure helmsman, Joss Whedon has exploded into a place so many of us Whedonites have known about for so long - we lost Buffy, Angel, Spike etc., We lost Captain Mal and Jayne, but now Joss has finally given the world what we all know he's capable of - an explosion of action/adventure that never fails to amaze, engage and to take the breath away - add that to the most fantastic one liners, sharp dialogue, character focus and the asset that is Robert Downey Jnr as Tony Stark/Iron Man and you've got a complete set of everything. Chris Hemsworth brings such surety as Thor, his presence is god like in many ways whilst Tom Hiddleston plays the most charismatic bad guy in years. Add in the fantastic Hawkeye, portrayed brilliantly by Jeremy Renner - Chris Evans as Captain America and Scarlett Johanson as Black Widow - finished off with an awe inspiring performance from Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and you pretty much have the most incredible spectacle in cinema history. I am a huge fan of the individual movies, but this just smashed the lot. The size is beyond words and let us not forget what Samuel L Jackson and Clark Gregg bring to the cast. Fantastic, brilliant, amazing - watch out for the great battles between Thor and Hulk, Iron Man and Hulk and how well they fit into the film.Samuel L Jackson is rumoured to have a Nick Fury movie coming soon - I can hardly wait - I hope Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johanson get their own movies too. Fabulous way to start the Avengers story. Joss Whedon needs to be heralded for his work and television bosses should sit up and see what they miss when a genuinely amazing talent goes to cinema.",10,2,6,6 May 2012
