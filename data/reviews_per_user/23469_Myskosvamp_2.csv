Antz," A thrilling experience in acting, technology and story.
",I saw this movie a while ago and I must say that it's the best animated movie I have. I left the cinema with an enormous smile on my lips. The technology though spectacular isn't the most thrilling in this movie. The great choices of actors and the sense that all roles are written for just the actor who performed it is the true thrill of this movie. The choice of Woody Allen as Z-4195 is truly a stroke of genius. He parodes all the earlier characters he has ever been in. And then you have Sylvester Stallone who excellently performs his role as Weaver and he also makes his earlier characters look a bit more human.To put it short it's a great movie for kids of all ages!,8,0,0,17 August 1999
Black Panther," Online campaign against Black panther
","With the unreasonable amount of negative reviews written about this movie I feel compelled to write one myself even though I normally don't It isn't hard to guess that this is a coordinated online campaign orchestrated by people who seem to think that an almost all black cast and powerful female characters isn't something that should become mainstream. Because this is a good movie as the vast majority of users and critics agree. It's a super hero movie. Not Bergman. And in that genre it is excellent. So if you're thinking of seeing it, don't be put off by a small amount of probably racist trolls. Just go see it.",8,0,1,2 June 2018
