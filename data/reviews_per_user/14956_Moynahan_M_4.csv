Requiem for a Dream," Heavy but must see
","It's a must see movie, there's no doubt about it... Not the typical type of movies I'm sure you're usually watching, this movie is just inspiring and you just wish you could help or do something...Deep feelings, it brings you to another level and sometimes make you cry 'for no reason', just because it's too hard to take...Really great movie with an excellent soundtrack!",10,0,1,10 July 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How to be bored in 10 minutes!
","This is a pathetic movie where the American kind is giving to itself a bad image... really! This movie shouldn't have been produced at all because it truly *****!Okay, I give it a 10 on 10 if you like the type of movie where everything seems perfect, that you can guess what will happen at every time and with an ending like in the fairy tales...I paid 10$ to see that piece of crap... At least I can say I did it for my little cousin who's 11!Might be for 12years-old and younger... Oh no, cause still, you might see some little 'adult actions'... PATHETIC!A BIG 3/10 cause it has a beginning, a heart and (thank God) AN END!!!",3,0,0,13 July 2003
The Incredibles," 'Incredible'
","Casting: Obviously, the characters are great, they do a good job at acting... But, more than that, the voices are just fine and you couldn't really have found better for it... So, good job real actors, the intentions and motivations of the characters were well understood!Summary: The Incredibles, story about how some superheros became 'Nobodies' and how a little guy who was a nobody became a (fake) superhero... Main story is Mister Incredible going to fight against a old lil' not-so-buddy of him and all the other 'Incredible SuperHeroes' helping him for an extraordinary movie... The Movie: Full of Adventure, even some suspense... A really great animated movie, far from what I expected... It is actually rare that the previews don't show the best of the movie... It's weird, but even if it's animated, you're fixing the screen, and you can't let it go... I bet you couldn't only watch 30min of the movie!Conclusion: A really great movie for the whole family, since it also contains little some 'hints' for adults and it shows a side of an ordinary but not so ordinary family after all! Excellent movie",10,0,0,27 November 2004
Donnie Darko," What if?
","Psychological but not too much movie who is just a must see (my opinion!)You completely enter into the mentality of a young teenager and all the movie long, you just wonder... The story is fantastic, the actors are great, the end is awesome... This is not a 10 but a 9 because still, something maybe too American-way for me...",9,0,0,5 August 2003
