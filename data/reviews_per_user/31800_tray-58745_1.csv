Hereditary," Just... NO... don't waste your time
","We made the mistake of actually going to the movie theater to see this movie because of all the hype that it was one of the greatest horror movie films of all time. LIES LIES LIES!! We were debating on leaving in the middle of the movie and we should have it was such a waste of time it was not horrifying, it was not scary, it was confusing, didn't make sense, and if you're a true horror fan don't bother wasting your time. These 10 star reviews are BS. The only good thing about this movie is that we saw it on a Tuesday night and with our Regal card we got everything 50% off. Please horror fans take my advice do not bother it's not even worth renting on demand not even for $1.99!",1,1,6,6 September 2018
