50 First Dates," A RomCom with actual romance and comedy
","Look, I'm a 40something year old dude. I don't do RomComs, which is probably why I'm just now seeing it for the first time...15 years after its release.This might be the happiest and saddest movie I may have ever seen. Not gonna lie...I teared up a couple times and I laughed a lot, too. Somehow Adam Sandler (Henry) manages to be incredibly believable in his devotion to Lucy. Oddly enough, one of the only other RomComs I've ever enjoyed in my life was The Wedding Singer. That was a more typical Sandler movie, but he and Barrymore definitely seem to have some sort of on screen chemistry that makes their characters feel more real and that is felt abundantly throughout this movie.There were a few times throughout where the movie felt like it might slip back to the 'usual' romcom story and also a few jokes that are typical for Sandler, but all in all, I didn't feel like I was watching a romcom or Sandler...I was simply watching a pretty good movie that hit across the emotional spectrum. Really well done overall.",8,1,1,19 July 2019
Get Out," I Don't Get The Hype
","Cookie cutter suspense/thriller/horror flick that isn't very suspenseful or thrilling or scary. The only real change from the norm with this movie is that it features a black man as the lead actor, and early on in the movie it touches on some of the problems of interracial dating from a black man's perspective. I found some humor in the way that the white family (and later their white friends) interacted with the lead character...going out of their way at times to either talk about how they voted for Obama or loved Tiger Woods...basically doing and saying the things that white people say to black people in an attempt to prove they aren't racist. The movie was fairly well acted despite not having exceptionally strong material to work with. I thought Daniel Kaluuya turned in a really strong performance and he really saved the movie, imo. I don't recall seeing him in anything else prior to this, but he gave an excellent performance and I hope this serves as a spring board to bigger/better roles. Seems very talented. My biggest problem with this movie is that I don't know what it was trying to be. It kind of hit a little bit with the satire and humor elements, but all in all, the movie just doesn't really have an identity. The 'mystery' behind everything was not well concealed and the twists and turns you'd expect from a movie like this just never developed. I had this movie pretty well figured out before the halfway mark, which made for a less enjoyable second half of the movie. I'm pretty amazed by all the rave reviews it's getting. It is a bit groundbreaking in it's own right strictly for the cultural/social/racial aspect - as that has been largely neglected in movies, especially this genre - but once you get passed that and just look at the movie for what it is, I can't really give this movie anything more than a middling grade. Not the worst movie I've ever seen by any means, but also not really worth the price of admission either. Wait for it to come out on Netflix and enjoy from the comfort of your own couch.",5,672,1227,10 March 2017
The Mummy Returns," Meh. Super Lazy Movie
","The Mummy was pretty much everything you'd expect out of a light action/adventure movie, which was fun, exciting, with the right doses of humor and wit sprinkled throughout. Simply put - it worked.I don't exactly know what they were going for with The Mummy Returns, but I don't think there was really a ton of effort put into this movie at all, especially from a writing standpoint. I imagine one of the early production meetings went like this:
'Let's take the heroes and villains from the first movie and have them go at it again, but this time throw a kid in the mix. And near the end of the movie we can introduce a new villain* for about 3 minutes. Oh, and let's throw in a rocket powered hot air balloon just for the hell of it.'* = Is the Scorpion King actually a villain? Because in the stand alone Scorpion King movie, he was definitely the hero.To me, this movie felt like it was thrown together with little prep work and was really only done so that The Rock/Dwayne Johnson could get started on his movie career. I remember the pre-movie hype about him 'starring' in it and then you watch it and find out it's basically just a CGI Rock near the end of the movie and he doesn't speak.The Mummy Returns doesn't really do much at all in terms of advancing character development of returning characters from the original and it doesn't tell a significantly new or different story. It might be one of the most pointless movies I've ever seen.",3,0,0,26 April 2019
The Replacements," Fun movie despite obvious mental handicap of practically everyone involved with writing, directing, and production.
","It's got plenty legitimately funny moments and lines and the cast turns in a fairly credible performance even though they have some awful material to work with. The biggest problems with this movie is the god awful directing and editing along with a blatant disregard for even a semi-realistic story about replacement players taking over when the primary players go on strike.1. Why are there replacement cheerleaders? Cheerleaders don't have a union and have no bargaining power. Players go on strike, cheerleaders don't.2. In the game against San Diego, Washington lines up for an onside kick. Before the kick, John Madden explains in the background that they need to recover the kick and call for a timeout. Bateman recovers the kick for Washington and runs around trying to score before he is tackled by Falco. Falco then calls a timeout. In no world would a QB ever be on the field for a kickoff. There's also no need to call a timeout after a kickoff is blown dead, as the clock stops anyway. I'm sure John Madden made mention of this to the director or someone.3. Leading up the game against Dallas, (striking) Washington star QB Martel makes it known that he is crossing the picket line to return to the team. Ownership happily welcomes him back and Falco is released. Apparently in this world there are also no backup QBs .4. During the Dallas game, Falco returns during halftime and is told to suit up. Eventhough he is no longer under contract and not on the official game day roster, he is allowed to return to the field with no objection from the refs or the opposing team.5. During the Dallas game, Bateman and Smith (both of whom play on defense) are in the offensive huddle and promptly execute a 20 yd run play eventhough they had never worked with the offense before.6. The production values of this movie are soooooooo effing awful, especially the music. At times it seemed more like a broken record rather than professional grade music editing.But in spite of its glaring flaws and poor execution, I can't not watch this movie whenever I come across it on TV. There's just something about this horribly made movie that gets me. Nearly 20 years later and I still get a kick out of it.",5,1,4,29 July 2019
