Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Much better
","Far out-does the first one in every way, without spoiling, I will say that I disliked the ending, it wasn't particularly bad but I would have perfered a different ending. But overall it had a much better plot than the 1st one, good action and a nice montage.",8,0,1,11 April 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," It was ok
","It's a silly action movie, excessive Gore but the action is actually really good, great sword fights. For the type of movie it's definitely missing a montage.",7,3,5,11 April 2019
