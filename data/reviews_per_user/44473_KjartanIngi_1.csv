Despicable Me 2," I love it
","I went to this movie with my aunt an I simply love this movie. The Minions are always as funny and I could not stop laughing during this movie, so did my aunt.Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud are making a great film here as a continuous film from Despicable me from the year 2010.About the story line in the movie.. It is about Gru, who, in the first movie, was the evil man who was trying to steal the moon, and in this movie he gets job opportunity to work as the good man trying to chase the evil man who stole a whole lab in the beginning of the movie.To me I was very excited to go to this movie and I went with my 8 years old aunt to this movie and I loved it :D",9,0,1,17 September 2013
