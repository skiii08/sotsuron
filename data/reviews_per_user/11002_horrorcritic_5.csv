The Ring," No stars out of four
","Female journalist stumbles across a video tape which claims the lives of it's viewers exactly seven days after they watched it. In a desperate attempt to save her life, she tries to track down the source behind the tape and find out how the tape is causing all of these deaths. The premise is old hat, but it does feature a creepy opening sequence and some suspense. However, as the film comes towards it's finale it grows sillier and beats the viewer upside the head to explain everything.",Null,0,1,19 March 2003
Jaws," Three stars out of four.
","A small beach town comes under attack by a great white shark that likes to make lunch meat out of the local tourists. Tightly directed little shocker with three wonderful leading performances and a sensational score is as exciting and as scary as they get. However, the shark is a bit unconvincing at times.",Null,0,1,6 March 2003
Halloween," One star out of four.
","Modern day slasher about a young man returning to his home town 15 years after murdering his older sister to murder a small group of friends supposedly without motive or reason. Another unmemorable film that made a killing at the box office. Other then above par direction, there really isn't anything that makes this any different from the countless sequels and films that it spawned. The final frame is totally unnecessary.",Null,1,2,6 March 2003
The Sixth Sense," Three stars out of four.
","A psychologist with a marriage that is falling to pieces and some other demons in his closet tries to put those problems aside and help a troubled young boy with a most unusual secret; he claims to see dead people. A bit disjointed, but it features some fine acting, a terrific ending and it is deeply moving & touching at times.",Null,0,0,7 March 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," No stars out of four.
","Dream demon haunts the dreams of the local teenagers, but if the teen dies in their dream, they end up dying in real life. This ended up grossing millions at the box office and features a great film premise. However, the special effects are cheap looking, the script is full of cliches & errors, and the performances are below par.",Null,0,0,6 March 2003
