The Expendables 2," One of the worst movies ever
","This is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. If you want to see 3000 people shot to death then you will love this movie. I saw this in an IMAX, but that didn't make the movie less painful. The story is the same old one, good partner gets killed the teams takes revenge. The first 15 minutes was bearable. There was nothing but mindless killing. Every scene is unrealistic and there is absolutely no story line. The good guys can apparently stand and shoot 1000 people face on face and bad guys will miss them. 5 guys shooting and killing 100 people in a open room without getting hit, is what best describes the movie. And finally stallone defeats the villain in fist fight. Oh he had a gun but u know fist fights are better. This is worse than any bad Indian movie i have ever seen. Most Indian superhero movies are much better than this movie. In short if you have watched any action movie, don't go to this movie.",2,37,58,14 September 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," WORST Movie this summer !!
","This is the worst movie that i have watched this summer. Thanks to IMDb's 7.8 rating i had to sit through 2 hours of torture. There is thin-to-no story line. The characters are very weak, and the female role has absolutely no part in the movie but to walk around. If you have watched the trailer, you have watched the movie. Do not expect anything 'interesting' from the movie. It is full of logical flaws. The 3 rating i have given is for the gfx effects, there were lots of continuity errors. Captan will be running for a second and the very next shot he will be in some place unrelated. In one word they have killed a comic classic.",Null,4,11,3 August 2011
