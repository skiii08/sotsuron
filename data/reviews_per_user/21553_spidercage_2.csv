Hereditary," The power of low IQ will give this a one
",People who have actually lived a life will understand this movie. People with hollow heads should check out Avengers instead. The latest one is better than Taxi Driver! That's amazing!!!!!As far as this movie goes the plot is fairly good and the actors di a great job. It's not that scary but it's disturbing a bit. There's a twist of classic horror which is cool but doesn't take away from the movie. The lead lady plays her role pretty much perfectly.,9,2,5,7 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Truly this is better than Taxi Driver
","Burn you Scorsese Blurays for another marvellian mass production... ummm... product is here! Let's get some CGI going, so happy we do not understand even the basics of the human psyche. Let's make sure no-one does! Let us judge everyone for we are truly better. Let's keep that PC flag flying high. Let's not see anything that it real, let's polish the world. We all hate real movies. Alpa Chino truly stands for Booty Sweat. Thank you so much!",2,44,69,6 November 2019
