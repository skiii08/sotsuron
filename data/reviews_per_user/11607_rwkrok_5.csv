Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," disappointing
","I'm as broad-minded as the next guy. (I hate when people say that.) But please. A few moments of amusement, but haven't we taken potty humor almost as far as it can go? My only problem is that there's really nothing fresh or new here - just the same clich√©s repackaged. If you get the Cohens you get bizarre. I get bizarre - I just didn't get this. There was a real opportunity here for some fresh humor. I am only avoiding referencing any lines because I don't want to have a spoiler problem on a movie I don't think anyone could spoil. The writing is a copout, the easy scatological stuff seems to have trumped the obvious opportunity for real satire. This wasn't bad - it just could have been so much better.Disappointing.",4,0,2,17 March 2007
Gettysburg," Accurate and entertaining.
","Great attention to detail. Historically accurate with just the right amount of dramatic license. Strangely, although I have great respect for Tom Berengeuer and Martin Sheen, I had more trouble buying them in their roles than I did the rest of the cast. This isn't to say they weren't good - just that the casting could maybe have been better. Jeff Daniels, on the other hand, was wonderful in his portrayal of Col. Chamberlain. The story of the fight for 'little round top' is a one that certainly demanded telling. I rented this movie as a prelude to an actual trip to Gettysburg by our family and especially myself and my then 12 year old son. We had a great time, largely due to the preparation given us by this movie. Thanks!!!",10,1,1,6 January 2006
Forrest Gump," Morality Play
","Anyone who has a problem with this movie on any level probably just doesn't understand parables. Gump at it's basic is a fable about a man who, although short on 'intelligence' nonetheless has a degree of common sense often absent in his intellectual superiors. Couple this with his moral compass and the way the story always places him in interesting situations and you have the canvas upon which this morality play unfolds. Gump is simple, gentle and loving - but, interestingly, he is not a wimp. He has courage of his convictions and does not hesitate to use violence to defend those he loves. Amazing this came from Hollywood. Refreshing.",10,1,4,25 June 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," Buy the Director's Cut
","Easily one of the best movies ever made. The acting of the impressive cast is every bit as good as one would expect and the script is excellent. The cinematic quality is pure artistry. The movie has just the perfect look: the muted colors, the use of both close-ups and panoramic shots - very Sergio Leone. The score lends an ethereal quality to it that is essential to the mood. I thought the 'Yesterday' injection when Noodles returns as an old man to Fat Moe's was a bit over the top - but the boys whistling the score as they were waiting to roll the drunk was pure genius. Avoid the butchered 2 1/2 hour version at all costs, buy the director's cut and watch it several times - you'll see new things each time. I did think the garbage truck was a bit bizarre and unnecessary, but that's another small issue with what is truly a masterpiece.",10,4,9,16 September 2006
Groundhog Day," Refreshingly unique
","Much has been said by other reviewers about the metaphorical aspects of this well written and acted film, so I won't waste time rehashing all that. Basically Bill Muray's character is forced into introspection and growth because the only element of his existence he is able to permanently change is himself. Murray is pretty good at this type of metamorphosis (see 'Scrooged'). While placing characters in situations that encourage or stimulate personal growth is common movie fare, the way it is accomplished here is really unique. In a world of so many copy-cat stories and variations on a theme this movie is brilliantly original. Oh yeah, the 'I got you, babe' every morning as an indication we're still on groundhog day is priceless.",9,2,4,16 September 2006
