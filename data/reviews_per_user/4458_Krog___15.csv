50 First Dates," Well, I Have To Admit, I Saw This On a First Date With a Girl
","Okay, that has nothing to do with anything, but I couldn't think of any good titles. Basically, the movie is about this guy who, in relationships with women, loves 'em and leaves 'em, yet he falls in love with a girl who has short-term memory. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore put in par performances as the leads.One of the things that got me angry about the movie was that one of the funniest parts of the movie was in the commercial. I hate when they spoil great moments. Oh, well. It was pretty funny, fairly standard for a romantic comedy, but it made me want to go to not only Hawaii but Alaska as well. The end was not exactly what I was expecting (I was thinking cliche), but it was still pretty good, and I definitely recommend it if you're in the mood.",6,0,0,20 August 2004
Blade II," Best Action Film In a While
","Blade II is one of the best action films I have seen in a while. Probably ever since the first Matrix. Of course, let me go on to explain... I didn't see the first Blade before seeing this. What attracted it to me was something rather odd: Danny John-Jules, who plays the Cat on the British sitcom 'Red Dwarf', has a supporting role in this film. And I was expecting it to be a horrible movie... anyway, back to what I was saying. I need a plot to evolve in order for me to enjoy it. So like, if a movie is about one thing and it stays being about that one thing, I don't enjoy it. Like Lord of the Rings: it starts off they have to destroy the ring and the goal never changes -- I disliked it for that reason. Nothing changed.But the evolving plot is why I liked Blade II. Not only does it deliver stylistic and awesome action, but the plot evolves above the point of Blade-vs.-vampires. That's where it truly succeeds. I gave it 9/10 -- it's, in my opinion, a very good example of a great action film, but I'd never give a pure action film 10/10. That's just me, though. If you like action films... enjoy :)",9,0,1,2 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A really bad movie ever unless you've read the books
","Everyone I know who has read the books lists this as their favorite movie....But I, not having read the books, thought it sucked. NOTHING HAPPENED. They formed a band of good guys and nothing else. In usual movies, that takes like five minutes, or is part of the backstory. This is three hours of the same thing over and over and over again.Excellent filmmaking, though. Really great scenery. I just wish it would've been about 2 1/2 hours less, and that there would have actually been a story going on.",1,7,16,21 March 2003
The Alamo," Remember the... the... What Was It Again?
","Not a very memorable movie at all.Billy Bob Thorton is the most memorable of a great ensemble cast perfectly suited for this movie. However, the writing and direction hinder what could have been great and turn it into a film not worth seeing unless you're bored and nothing better is on.The film follows the small group of brave men who defended the Alamo with their lives... and failed. It wasn't a war so much as a massacre, but that's a debate I'll leave to the historians.Anyway, it's far from great, but it's not that bad, either. Fairly middle-of-the-road, actually. Then again I'm not a big fan of epics. The only one that I truly thought was great was Love, Actually and that's something that's debatable, too.At least it's better than Troy....",5,1,4,20 August 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Funniest Movie of 2001
","This was the funniest movie of 2001! This is the epitamy of 'dumb humor'. It spoofs such movies as Point Break with its incredibly stupid lines, horribly horrible acting, and 3-minute racing scenes for what should take about 10 seconds. Paul Walker is the worst actor ever to have stumbled his way into the big-screen and that's what really made the movie work. Vin Diesel, a decent actor, chooses the comedy gem that brought him to mainstream humor venues and later got him into the less-funny XXX. I reccommend it for everyone with a sense of humor who can laugh at things like this.That said, this was complete sh*t. Zoolander, I believe, was the funniest movie of 2001 if I remember correctly, and this was the dumbest. Avoid unless you want something to laugh at for its stupidity. If you take it serious, 0/10. If you don't take it serious, 6/10.",3,2,5,11 August 2003
Pearl Harbor," 9/11: A Romance
","Okay, so just a quick rant here, but imagine if 50, 60, 70 years from now filmmakers make a movie about 9/11; except, instead of it being about 9/11, it's a dumb soppy romance that has nothing to do with 9/11 itself. Wouldn't you be just a little p***ed off? I know I would be. Taking a horrible tragedy and turning it into an insanely stupid movie with a lame romance story would be terrible.Now imagine that that tragedy actually took place 50, 60, 70 years ago, and that the insanely stupid movie was released today. As a matter of fact, make it be Pearl Harbor. Oh, wait, THEY ALREADY DID THAT. Talk about totally disgracing and disregarding a horrible tragedy. Good job, guys; now let's watch you make fun of disabled people.Anyway, that's just my little rant. Now back to the movie...It was sh!t. The romance was stupid, the acting subpar, and the writing was like jamming a screwdriver into your brain through your ears. The only decent thing about it was the special effects, but since many other movies have just as good if not better effects, that's probably not a good reason to see it.I don't recommend this film at all.",2,71,142,22 August 2004
Alien vs. Predator," The Enemy Of My Enemy Is My Friend. Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right. If You Give a Mouse a Cookie....
","I have to admit, I'm not the biggest Aliens or Predator fan. The Alien movies were good actioners at best, and the first Predator was the only one of the two worth any merit, even if I was laughing the whole time because it featured governors of California and Minnesota. So I didn't come in expecting a great movie. And I didn't get a great movie. But I got a good movie, a movie that is what it is supposed to be: a good action flick.The plot is about this group of adventurers who find a pyramid buried under Antarctica, or Alaska, or Alabama... I don't know. Doesn't matter. They go there to find a giant hole in the ground leading to the pyramid, a hole that wasn't there the day before. Down at the pyramid they find that it's an ever-changing--okay, so basically, it's a movie about aliens fighting predators. Some cool fight scenes, but it needed more oomph, and there was too much pointless backstory. I kept waiting for the Pepsi-Cola thing to come into play or SOMETHING to happen with that, but apparently the makers just felt like throwing a whole bunch of money around to make a rather expensive set for a backstory that isn't needed. Grr. Right, because we're supposed to feel for the characters... yeeeeeeah....Anyway, it needed to get to the aliens fighting the predators part quicker, and it needed more action, but sans those it was still a pretty good movie. If you're in the mood, I recommend it.",7,0,0,20 August 2004
No Country for Old Men," Great
",Quite simply one of the greatest films of all time. I watch it at least once a year. Every viewing makes the movie richer and more interesting.,10,1,1,13 July 2019
1941," The Reason Spielberg Doesn't Do Comedies
","Okay, so Jaws, the Indiana Jones trilogy, Close Encounters, Jurassic Park, etc. etc. etc. gave me great respect for Steven Spielberg. This movie made me want to punch him in the jaw. I mean, I still have the respect, but I'd just like to give him a quick jab to even things out.A 'comedy' in the loosest term of the word. So my friend and I were talking a while back about whether any comedies about war had ever been made, and then we saw that there was this movie. Hey, and it was directed by Steven Spielberg. Cool! Then, of course, we actually saw the movie.In the vein of Airplane! and The Naked Gun! except not funny; that's probably the best way to describe it. The plot revolves around an ensemble of people during a fictional Japanese invasion of Los Angeles in WWII. To those who think it was wrong and insulting to do a comedy during a war: 1) it wasn't funny anyway, and 2) what's the difference between doing a comedy set during a war and doing a romance set during a war?Sorry, just ranting about Pearl Harbor. I mean, think of if they made a romance movie based around 9/11... anyway, stay away from this movie unless you laugh at anything. Krog out.",3,8,15,19 August 2004
Hero," The Usual Suspects meets Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon... yet not nearly as good as either
","Excellent visuals. Brilliant cinematography. Superb directing. Wonderful fight scenes.And yet the movie still sucked. Well, okay, it didn't suck, but it wasn't that good, either. It was... middle-of-the-road. Of course, if you like a movie only for its action and visuals, then you'll probably love Hero. Otherwise you might want to stay away from it.THE STORY (poss. spoilers; I mean, not really 'cause you can see it coming anyway, but oh well) <----> Centering in flashbacks around a great warrior known as Nameless who comes to the Emperor of China, it tells the tale of Nameless and his exploits with three deadly assassins after the Emperor. If you've seen the Usual Suspects, you know what happens; if you haven't, then you should go see that instead.I gave it 5/10 because it's not really anything special, but it isn't horrible, either. Just lame.",5,1,2,21 September 2004
Midsommar," Shallow, Empty, Pointless
","A shallow and empty exercise that mistakes vagueness for complexity and change for character work. The opening 10-20 minutes of the film is brutal; extremely well made and extremely true to life, but completely unnecessary and somewhat contradictory to the main points of the rest of the movie. Then we move into a slow burn look at a group of friends as they travel to Sweden to visit what they slowly discover is a murderous cult. Slow burns work best when there is mystery present, when the audience has questions they want answered. This movie doesn't have that. The characters are mostly *less* than two dimensional, other than the boyfriend who is an interesting character to watch but awful person. Every one of the main characters acts against what we know about them; this is especially rough in the climax where an important female character makes a decision that doesn't fit what we know about her at all (although the fact that all of the friends stayed after a horrific act occurs early on already destroys any sense of character that exists). There's also a character with a disability put there entirely to be 'weird'; way to go, filmmakers - let's use a disability to show how weird these people are.Shallow, empty, pointless - but apparently well-researched, so I guess that's something to think about during the 2 1/2 hour runtime",3,27,47,13 July 2019
This Is Spinal Tap," Good, but not nearly as good as Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show or A Mighty Wind
","A decent, sort of funny documentary, rockumentary, mockumentary, whatever you wish to call it. People who started off with Guffman, Show or even A Mighty Wind will be sorely disappointed as it is not nearly as funny or smart as these, but still worth the four or five really good moments in the movie. Geez, I heard it was classic and thought it would be better than the new movies... Wasted all that money.... This is one to rent, not buy.",2,6,25,29 May 2003
Joker," Meh
","<ul><li>Knock, knock.</li><li>Who's there?</li><li>A collection of moments from better films shoved together in a half-assed unintelligent, empty, and unnecessarily long waste of time.</li><li>A collection of moments from better films shoved together in a half-assed unintelligent, empty, and unnecessarily long waste of time who?</li><li>Joker.</li></ul>Aggressively uninteresting and without a point, this movie just steals moments from other, better movies and doesn't handle them nearly as well. The two main influences are Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, both of which are overrated and yet still much better than this trash.The worries about violence are overblown, mainly because the movie doesn't even have a real point of view. Does it want to be an exploration of someone with a mental health issue? There's only occasionally surface-level rumblings. Does it want to be a villain origin story? We've already had multiple, better origins for Joker. Does it want to be a superhero take on The King of Comedy? De Niro is barely in the film and not realistic in the slightest as a character. Does it want to be a Psycho-esque story of a crazy boy and his crazy mother? It hits all the wrong notes. Does it want to be about a woman who finds out her boyfriend is insane? The neighbor shows up rarely and without logic - there's no reason to have her in the movie at all. Does it want to be a Breaking Bad sort of story of how one man goes bad and starts murdering? He was never good to begin with; the story is almost pointless. Does it want to be a commentary on modern rich v. poor, conservative v. liberal protests and issues? There's nothing remotely close to any substance there, and any relation to the real world is extremely convoluted and poorly thought out.Every plot turn is easily seen a mile away but treated like it needs a huge buildup. All of the relationships are hollow and unearned, the characters being mere pawns for plot machinations that aren't even worth the time. Joaquin Phoenix is great in the role, so I guess there's that.",3,20,55,5 October 2019
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," I Love Lamp
","Will Ferrell is a comedic actor who not everyone enjoys. And when I say not everyone, I mean I don't enjoy him either.That said, I did like the SNL Celebrity Jeopardy skits. Doesn't matter. Ron Burgundy is typical Ferrell humor; if you like it, then you'll like this movie--otherwise, steer clear of it.To me it's like a SNL skit drawn out way too far. Ron is an anchorman who has some problems with the new reporter at the station, a woman. Then some stuff happens, there's some other crap that happens, and generally a whole bunch of lame jokes bombard the theatre-goer.I only recommend to fans of Ferrell.",2,1,3,21 August 2004
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Little kiddies movie
","This is just a little kids' movie. If you're younger than 12, you'll probably like this. It's just a whole bunch of hack jokes put together around the story of King Arthur and his search for the Holy Grail. It is also the story of a police search for the murderer of a documentarian and the story of a writer's battle with the sun and some clouds.So like I said, 12 and under.",4,9,32,14 July 2003
