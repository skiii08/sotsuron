Black Swan," This should not be Classified as a 15 more appropriate is 18
","I went to see this film this weekend, and came away feeling I was glad to get away.This film certainly should not be classified as a 15 as there was a lot of unnecessary violence and was too sexually explicit for a 15 year old to view.Felt very let down by the people who classified this film and if it was classed as an 18 I would be better prepared as to what I might see. In all truthfulness, I would not have allowed my 16 year old daughter go and see this with her friends. The story line was good but spoilt it for me by the degree of violence and sexual activity.",1,5,14,7 February 2011
