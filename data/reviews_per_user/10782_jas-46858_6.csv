Hereditary," An experience I wont forget.
","I want to start by saying I understand why people may not give this a high review. The trailers marketed this as something to redefine horror, however, this film is incredibly unique, and you shouldn't compare it to others.Some of the dialogue was straight up bad. To quote some of the lines, there is; 'Wipe that face off your face.' and 'What language is even that.' It thrusted me out of the film entirely. The ending felt slightly disappointing, but that's just my opinion, but apart from that I have nothing bad to say.The best thing about this film is the acting. It's superb, Gabriel Byrne was good, although his character the most underwritten, Alex Wolff was great and the way he expressed true terror is unforgettable, Milly Shapiro had a golden film debut as she absolutely owns the role of the creepy child, and ofcourse Toni Collette stole the show. Depending on what other films come out this year, I could definitely imagine her getting an Oscar nomination for this role.The Camera work is flashy, yet subtle. It is absolutely brilliant. Hereditary wouldn't be half the film it is without Pawel Pogorzelski's jaw dropping cinematography. Once again, I would not be surprised to see this get nominated. The story was good, it incorporated super realistic topics like Family Drama and grief with the more supernatural topics like Ghosts and Spirits. The set design I think is really underappreciated. Most horror movies have big scary dirty houses, but as you can tell from any trailer, this big house is modern and a first in horror movies for me.Overall, you need to at least watch this film. Hate it or love it, you wont forget this film in a hurry,",8,1,2,6 July 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Good for Superhero movie, bad for a movie movie.
","Ill start with the positives, Thor was funny. He had a new character which was unusual at first but later accepted. Like these latest Marvel films, it was quite a funny film, in fact, the film was a lot less serious than earlier marvel and superhero films. The worlds were very creative and that trash place was very well designed. Loki was Loki which was great to see, and the use of Led Zepplin will always be appreciated in my books.BUT, and there is a big but.It misses out on two big things; Story and Tension. Now if you haven't seen the film yet I am putting a Spoiler warning here however I wont go into details. Basically the story is Odin dies and then this girl that's apparently Thor's Sister (doesn't effect the story) and she wants to rule Asgard. But UH OH, SHE KILLS LOADS OF PEOPLE. So Thor tries to stop her with the unbreakable hammer and it breaks. You've seen it in the trailers, it does a titanic. So he gets banished to this trash world and has to fight and escape that world to save Asgard. It's a very simple story that give any messages, it doesn't have any plot twists, and you know exactly how it ends...This leads me to my second point. Tension. We all know how it was going to end. Thor wins. Duh. It's a superhero movie so of course the super hero wins. Now, in a good film like The Dark Knight, we know that Bruce is Human and he can be beaten, so when the Joker begins killing other people it impacts him mentally, and the Dark Knight is often close to dying. Also, the Joker is threatening to kill people WE CARE ABOUT. We care about Harvey Dent, and Rachel, and Gordon. This establishes something called 'Tension.' When you have a literal unkillable god trying to save a bunch of people we don't know or care about, it kind of removes tension, so you end up questioning why we should still care what happens in the film.I do want to move onto a positive note, and here's another spoiler alert. This film has consequences that effect the whole story of the Marvel Universe. I've got to hand it to them, they did that well. A planet actually blows up and Thor loses an eye. I never thought this would happen as in most films where a city or world is in danger the superhero saves it and then the next film they act like nothing has happened. I praise them for that.So to summarise, read the title. It is a good superhero, and it deserves praise. But is it an 8.0+ rated film? No. I would still recommend this film though, it has some funny moments and the visuals are amazing, and if superhero films are your favourite film then this will top your list.Thank you for your time.",8,2,5,29 November 2017
8 Mile," Realistic in good ways and bad
","When I think of 8 mile I think of the word 'Realistic.' I wouldn't say 'Good' nor 'Bad' but realistic.To start, the characters are very realistic, layered, and each one of them behaves in ways you'd expect people in their situations to be like. This is a heavy foundation of the film as you enjoy seeing these characters on screen and how they react to new situations. Also the direction was surprisingly well done. I went in expecting this film to be carried by it's star actor but the direction, especially the atmosphere of the city at night, was very authentic.However, the story is not the greatest. Don't get me wrong, the idea is great and I suppose all boys have at least dreamt about being a rapper, but the film fails to support it's realism in the story. Things happen in this film to inconvenience or convenience the main character, and don't happen naturally. Sometimes there is hinting that these things will happen but that is the most you are given. This makes the films three act structure really forced. Another problem I had was that the film sort of forced you to agree with its opinion. Staying spoiler free, the characters do things, or make some rhymes, and the film sort of says 'Yeah that's right, this is cool, and this is right!' without leaving you the space to make your own mind. Final problem, for a film about music, there is quite a lack of music and original songs. There was only one original song, which was 'Lose Yourself.' It did deserve to win the Oscar as it matched everything in the film and, by itself, is a good song.Overall, I would recommend this film to watch as an example of what a totally realistic film looks like, for better or worse.",5,0,2,22 March 2018
La La Land," Love or Hate musicals: Watch this film!
","As you may be able to tell by the other reviews on this website, everyone is split on whether this is a good film, or a bad film. Think of it as this, the film is described as a Comedy, Musical and Drama.This film is funny when it needs to be. I wouldn't call it an out and out comedy like a Kevin Hart or Will Ferrell film. Nor would I compare it to a Wes Anderson film where it's a witty black comedy. It's just funny when it needs to be.This film is a brilliant drama. The film begins and you may think 'Oh well this is generic' but if you stay to the very end of this film you will find that Damien Chazelle has not only proved himself as a very good writer, but is a world class director. No other director can develop characters and make you care for them like Damien.This film is also a musical, surprise surprise. I don't know what people were expecting coming into a modern musical, but the Director chose Jazz. Not everyone likes Jazz, but personally I thoroughly enjoyed the music in this film, and this comes from someone who doesn't like musicals OR JAZZ.I won't ridicule you for not liking this film, but no matter what you think about Musicals, or Dramas, or the film itself. You MUST watch your film.",10,6,7,11 February 2018
The Greatest Showman," Average: The Musical
","I can understand why people enjoy this film. Ill start this reviews with the positives. This film does successfully make you feel good. The actors seem to be having a great time during this film and some moments between characters are heartfelt. The dancing is great and the excellent cinematography emphasises this. The director also uses lighting brilliantly. It's hard to describe, but you will notice it during this film and like it. The music is good, and although some weaker than others, and another nitpick that I'll get to later, you will have most of these songs stuck on repeat in your head, 'This is me' definitely deserved the nomination.However when there isn't singing and dancing the film is bland and generic. The characters are very one dimensional and lack character arcs. This was a problem with every character in this film, including the nameless characters. It was very black and white, people either hated the circus or loved it. The director also presented every single rich person as 'snobby and hateful' to the circus. The story of P.T Barnum is an interesting one, however the film didn't do well presenting the struggles of getting a circus, infact, glossed over an entire section of him and the circus late in the film! When it came to the music, it was good, no doubt, however it sounded very present-day for a film set in the 19th century.To summarise, I wouldn't call it one of the great films of the year, however a fan of musicals will adore this film, and the story will deliver for any casual movie goer. I WOULD recommend this film",6,1,3,11 February 2018
Incredibles 2," Take off your nostalgia glasses.
","We all loved the first film. It's a classic, it's great, but there are people giving 10s to this film, when really it doesn't deserve it. I always say, a sequel doesn't get points for having the original characters, but it does for what they do with them, but I feel like the characters have gone backwards this film. Suddenly, Bob Parr is selfish, and half of the film is just Jack Jack doing cute baby things because cute babies get ha has from the audience.The animation was great, the sound was great, as up to the standard of pixar. But the story was so simplistic I really couldn't grasp onto it. 14 years to write a story! To put into perspective, Eraserhead took 6 years to make. 14 years, for this? I love Incredibles as much as the last person, but seriously, this is a blatant cash grab and I am saddened by the fact this sequel is now higher rated than the original. I hope those who gave this film perfect 10s are disappointed when they re-watch it on DVD release, because they'll realise they've been tricked.",5,1,5,11 July 2018
