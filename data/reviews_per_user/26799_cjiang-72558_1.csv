Blade Runner 2049," Worst Movie of 2017
","First of all the story line is good. How the director told the story ruined the movie.If he told the story at the normal speed the movie would just be a little more than an hour. The real movie lasted more than 2 and a half hours which means every action is at less than half speed and long periods of silence.I won't call it an action movie since there was very little action.It was made a 3D movie for no reason at all. There was nothing spectacular to see. All you will see is smog.The music which was mostly super loud noise started from time to time to tell the audience something was about to happen.Watch the movie if you are at home doing chore otherwise, don't.",2,5,10,5 November 2017
