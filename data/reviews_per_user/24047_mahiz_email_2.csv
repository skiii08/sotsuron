Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Sitting in the cinema and even after an hour thinking to myself, so whens it going to start... sighhh
","So anyway i love all 3 original movies from the trilogy, but this one well lets just say its OK to watch it once, Johny depp as always was brilliant, it wasn't him that made the movie bad. just the overall storyline wasn't as gripping, there were no real monsters or cool epic fights in my opinion, and without giving anything away, i just got to say its one of those movies that you definitely have to watch just for the sake of watching it, and then think 'mehh that was pretty mediocre'. big disappointment to me. i think they ruined a classic trilogy and im trying to delete it out my head. Its as though they made it just for the money, and the passion i felt in the 1st 3 died but thats my opinion, i guess watch for yourself and judge.",4,0,1,29 May 2011
The Purge," GREAT CONCEPT, Sadly lost its potential halfway
","Just saw the film Purge, the concept had so much potential to be a truly deep film about society, human nature and evil, but halfway through it just ended up into a pointless violent movie, wasted storyline that could have turned into a great film. I wanted to know who was the new founding fathers, that was always on my mind since they kept bringing it up, was there a conspiracy?, who was in charge?, what is the world like outside of that neighbourhood?, so many unanswered questions just made it frustrating towards the end and it didn't help that the ending wasn't exactly satisfying in my eyes. I wanted to see some kind of justice or more aftermath but it just leaves so much open and your left with what seems like a half finished plot that ended on a low note. After watching it all though sometimes you wonder will the world ever become that stupid like The Running Man (1987)",4,1,2,15 August 2013
