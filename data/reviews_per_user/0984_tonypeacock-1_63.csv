Saturday Night Fever," A glance back at a short-lived phenomenon
","Saturday Night Fever is a movie phenomenon not for its screenplay, cast or photography but the Bee Gees inspired disco soundtrack.The shrieking notes of several Bee Gees songs are featured throughout as well as several other recognisable tracks that they wrote.The disco 'phenomenon' was a blink and you'll miss it era during the late 1970s and this film epitomized that era. Starring John Travolta as Italian-American teenager Tony Manero.Travolta's dance moves and disco wear have featured in several other films and have been the forefront of 'dad' dancing on dancefloors everywhere!It was interesting to watch the film to see the costumes. Very memorable scenes. Travolta wouldn't be able to fit into them now. The first two thirds of the film are pretty moribund and I only found some resemblance of storyline in the final act of the film. A storyline focusing on Manero's troubled New York City family life, questionable love interests and friends. A good portrait of the era but a film I am unlikely to seek out again if I am honest.",6,1,2,31 August 2017
First Man," One small step for Man, one giant bore of a film.
","'One small step for Man, one giant leap for mankind' are the famous first words uttered by NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong who became the first man to step foot on the moon in 1969.First Man details the near decade long struggle by NASA to complete the first manned mission to the moon starring Ryan Gosling as Armstrong.The film is surprisingly directed by Damien Chazelle a director more famous for great critical successes Whiplash (2015) and La La Land (2016).The film charts the many setbacks faced by NASA including great tragedy leading up to the Apollo 11 mission.Gosling seems emotionless at times. The film focuses on the inner demons of Armstrong and the seemingly constant cycle of grieving for his young daughter who tragically died through a brain tumour in the early 1960s.
Is it the struggling to come terms with her death that drives Armstrong onto ever dangerous space missions?The film does drag on a little to much and loses some of its early promise. Not having lift off for me. (Pardon the pun).A film called Apollo 13 many years ago also focused on the issues of sixties technological limitations.Claire Foy plays Armstrong's long suffering wife Janet. Her performance is better than Gosling.A film that has some good visuals but fails with a rigid leading man and a well documented story. After all who was alive in 1969 and didn't see the conclusion of the Apollo 11 mission?
The film despite running time issues does end abruptly with the moon landing as it's crescendo.
The film does give an Executive Producer credit to Steven Spielberg.",7,1,3,16 October 2018
The Sound of Music," Edelweiss..great sing along songs. Das ist gut.
","Film adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical featuring great photography of Salzburg, Austria. A country that was annexed by Nazi Germany in the 1930s.Featuring fantastic sing along songs that even for a more horror film fan like me I found enjoyable.Julie Andrews plays the lead role as a nun turned governess (nanny) Maria to an authoritarian family, the Von Trapp's with Christopher Plummer as it's head, widower naval Captain Von Trapp. A proud Austrian who despises the new Nazi regime.Now despite the charming music how can someone live their lives to the musical melodies like in The Sound Of Music?Director Robert Wise does an admirable job in bringing together excellent photography, music and storyline.A film that shows the full brilliance of the Austrian mountains.",8,2,2,2 September 2018
Spartacus," Masters of the cinema. I'm Spartacus!
","A three hour plus epic directed by Stanley Kubrick after the original director Anthony Mann was fired a week into the production!Like other epics of the period an intermission is included.
Reminded me of Ben-Hur with its Roman empire background.It follows the adult life of Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) who fights against his miserable life of slavery at the hands of the Roman's including barbaric gladiatorial fights to the death.A strong supporting cast includes greats such as Laurence Olivier, Peter Ustinov and Charles Laughton. Laughton has his usual dry humour in an otherwise serious story.Thousands of extras, 70mm photography and Kubrick himself add to the gravitas and epic feel of the film.
Douglas himself puts all of his early life of poverty into his role.After this film Kubrick tended to shy away from Hollywood. I can see his later career veered away from this kind of film.The film underwent extensive restoration in the early 1990s restoring a controversial bath scene between Crassus (Olivier) and his young slave Antoninus (Tony Curtis).A great example of some masters of cinema. Worth the three hours plus running time.",8,0,1,6 February 2020
Hereditary," Kiddie horror that is over-hyped
","No, No, No, No, No so over hyped!! The film follows a family (pretty disjointed one at that!) where the grandmother dies and some creepy events take place over the next hour and a half amongst the remaining family members.I'm not going to spoil the details for you but the only positive I see from this film is a pretty good performance from Toni Collette (who I kept thinking was going to break into a nightmare version of the Australian, Muriel in Muriel's Wedding!).I went to the cinema showing (unwittingly) expecting a horror film in the mould of The Exorcist and I was let down. You see I was taken in by the clever marketing campaign that compares this film to such horror classics as the aforementioned The Exorcist. Nowhere near and a bad comparison.I should have seen the warning signs. I mean a 15 rated film! How can that live up to real horror. It is more kiddie horror used by studios to maximize audiences. The music score (especially over the end credits) reminded me more of the cult music of the islanders on The Wicker Man! Director Ari Aster has revealed a mildly entertaining thriller with perhaps one shocking event. Just don't entertain this film. Wait for it to appear late night on one of the free to air TV channels if you must!",6,0,0,30 April 2020
Chinatown," Seventies film noir classic
","What a gem from 1974. A film I had never heard of apart from its listing in Steven Schneider's 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.Directed by Roman Polanski and starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway it was made in the pre-blockbuster era and really shows the brilliance of the director rather than a few gimmicky CGI effects and laser beams!The film noir genre is epitomised by films from the forties shot in black and white and sort of detective thrillers. Here we have a Technicolor film from 1974 revisiting the genre. The performance of Nicholson as private detective Jake Gittes is mesmerising and up there with his other great roles. Gittes is an ex-policeman who worked in the Chinatown district of Los Angeles. Now a private detective in 1930s LA. He becomes embroiled in the private life of the chief engineer of LA's water and power department. Hired by his so called wife at the films beginning he later discovers it wasn't actually who she claimed. Investigating further what turns out to be so called adultery actually becomes a murder, greed and intimidation case involving the local water supply!The story could actually have been a screenplay for an episode of Murder, She Wrote but the performances of the cast and ultimately its direction by Polanski are wonderful to watch. It's the camera angles, the screenplay, photography that all come to the fore.No doubt you will never have heard of it but I would highly recommended it over the modern multiplex trash.",9,2,3,28 February 2017
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Always look on the I don't get this Monty Python humour
","One of the most over rated comedy films of all times. I just don't get the humour of the Monty Python comedy troupe.I have given the film two viewings but still haven't changed my view of it. In Life Of Brian the early life of Jesus or rather the baby from the stable next door, Brian of Nazarath (Graham Chapman) being the subject. Although it has very little Jesus in it and is not a satire on him or any religious faction. Some people call it 'British' humour. Well I'm as British as they come and I don't get it. All I get is several performers playing several characters in a series of supposedly comic sketches loosely put together in a film.I suppose some working knowledge of biblical stories might have helped a little although I see little reference to religion more the Roman Empire province of Judea. It was more interesting to see that the late Beatle member George Harrison was Executive Producer and his film company HandMade Films helped release the film.HandMade were behind some of the more controversial films of the period such as this and The Long Good Friday.",5,1,1,30 April 2020
Darkest Hour," Good performances even if the facts are not wholly accurate
","I went into this viewing with an appreciation of Winston Churchill as a great WWII Prime Minister. However at times I was frankly bored with the Westminster Houses of Parliament scenes that reminded me of BBC Parliament.
Churchill himself is played by Gary Oldman. Oldman is transformed into the rather portly Churchill by great prosthetic make up that reminded me of the transformation of the late Robin Williams into Mrs. Doubtfire.
On a serious note, Oldman gives a great performance as Churchill. Showing his rather scary demeanour mixed with a hidden humour.I can't vouch for the historical facts of some scenes. I particularly draw attention to one scene where a bewildered Churchill finds inspiration not from his fellow Cabinet members, Royalty or Parliamentarians but by ordinary 'Londoners' on a tube train.
The tube train takes about five minutes to travel one stop on the District Line. Really!As I have alluded to my historical knowledge of Churchill is limited but he comes across in the film as a great orator. A leader of men whilst some others dither with appeasement and talks.A decent film for Oldman's performance if anything.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Rocky V," Descends into farce. A sad entry in the franchise.
","I've heard things about this film before viewing but I decided to view it with a clear mind and no misconceptions.Director duties pass back to original Rocky director John G. Avildsen.
Indeed the screenplay at the start of the film has potential.Watching the franchise in sequence I noticed some continuity issues in the first twenty minutes.
Rocky's mansion is noticeably different from his residence in parts III and IV.The story follows an aging Rocky, brain damaged from his bruising bout with Ivan Drago on part IV.
The Balboas also face financial ruin due to their estate being signed over by brother in law Paulie (how) to an accountant who makes a poor decision on the stock market.Rocky must return to his roots in Philadelphia from part I where he relaunched his only asset. Mickey Goldmill's boxing gym.He discovers a promising young boxer, Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison - a distant relative of John Wayne) whilst inadvertently neglecting his own troubled son, Rocky Jr. (Sage Stallone).Meanwhile a Don King like promoter George Duke (Richard Gant) 'steals' the non-contracted Gunn from Rocky's management promising a title shot.Gunn isn't as commercially popular as Rocky and Duke encourages Gunn to try and fight Rocky.
Rocky is reluctant because of his health problems much to Gunn's anger leading to the infamous street fight.The film descends into a Cannon Films like 1980s farce with a street fight, yes a street fight between Rocky and Tommy Gunn.The soundtrack was one of the highlights of part IV. What happened here. Not memorable at all except a montage from previous Rocky films over the end credits.I can quite honestly say this is by far the weakest in the franchise, comparable to Superman IV and Jaws IV.",4,1,2,25 April 2020
Argo," Entertaining but severely overrated patriotism?
","Argo is a true story film, whilst entertaining in that it kept me glued to it, is severely overrated.It won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2013 and seems to have some critics swooning (especially U.S. ones I found).You see, it is about an unorthodox CIA mission to rescue six embassy workers holed up in the Canadian ambassadors house in Tehran in 1980. Basically they managed to escape marauding mobs of Iranians who invaded the U.S. embassy.Their fate could quite easily mean death and public execution. Such is the environment at the time.I didn't like how the British embassy involvement was airbrushed from the film.
Anyway a military rescue by special forces is at first ruled out leaving CIA agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to explore other options for evacuation.A series of bad ideas is mooted including setting up a fake Canadian science fiction film production using Iran as a location to cover the moon. (Why!)Mendez actually travels to Iran to rendevous with the six escapees in the Canadian ambassadors house with cooperation from the Canadians and a set of fake Canadian passports to hand to set up the production, Argo as in the title.Argo is some fake, rejected Flash Gordon like project.The six eventually come round to the highly dangerous idea and evacuate the country on a commercial flight in a game of cat and mouse at the airport.The film is true and entertaining and I had never heard of the operation, only being revealed under the President Clinton administration years later it is displayed on screen.An average film, but nothing special. If anything like a TV docu-drama.
Directed by Ben Affleck.",7,0,0,21 April 2019
Billy Elliot," Film instantly evoked memories of Ken Loach
","As the title of this review suggests this film quickly evoked comparisons to your typical Ken Loach film.Directed by Stephen Daldry it follows the highly unlikely topic of ballet in a 1984 County Durham mining village in Northern England amidst the backdrop of the miners strike of the time.That is one typical Loach trait. The left leaning political climate of the film.
The second is the older brother character to the lead Billy Elliot. It reminded me a little of the Jud character in the classic film Kes.The plot concerns a young boy who instead of following the usual route of the local boxing gym ends up being taught ballet by Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters).I have never been disappointed with a Walters performance to be fair. She just has this comedic, down to earth manner.The film has an excellent soundtrack from the 1970s vinyl of the Elliot family, a bit of The Clash and 'London Calling'.The film was the springboard for the acting career of a young Jamie Bell in the title role of Billy Elliot.
A commercial success leading to spin offs such as the customary musical show.",7,2,2,23 June 2019
Just Go with It," Just go with an Adam Sandler film?
","Adam Sandler films are an enigma I usually avoid with a passion.This lazy rom-com has the usual conventions that apply to the genre.The film is loosely based on the 1960s film Cactus Flower as Sandler plays a questionable plastic surgeon Danny who uses his female assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) as his fake ex-wife to woo a young, good looking girlfriend Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) on a trip to Hawaii.One lie evolves into another as Kathryn inadvertently takes a telephone call from one of her actual children whilst posing as Danny's wife. Quell they end up tagging along on the Hawaii trip.Not that Aniston doesn't share those attributes. That is the problem and the outcome is so inevitable. Sandler falls for Aniston towards the film's conclusion.Earlier I called Danny a questionable plastic surgeon. In that I meant he has poor medical ethics sharing patient's embarrassing health problems. So much for patient - doctor confidentiality!Oh before I forget I must show horn Nicole Kidman into this review like she was in the film!Kidman plays a character who was a bit of a bully to Kathetine at at school. A completely unnecessary addition to the cast. Which brings me to another one.Annoying doesn't describe a High School buddy of Danny who tags along for the ride under the pretence of being Katherine's fiancé.He wears thick lenses and sports an annoying accent which made me think why is he there?Lazy 'comedy' I suppose but a film I won't be in a rush to view again. Maybe I will compare to 1969s Cactus Flower.",4,0,1,25 May 2020
The Hustler," Paul Newman, pool, danger. What a combination.
","Not the most modern film you are going to see, it was filmed in 1961 black and white but one that has reminated with me for hours.It tells the story of a U.S. pool hustler, 'Fast Eddie' Felson (Paul Newman) who survives from fleecing men of thousands across the pool rooms of the country before being recognised and having to move to the next city.Pool, a great sport it is, is not the only message of the film. Eddie gets into a relationship with someone facing her own demons in alcoholism, Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) who has to adapt to Eddie's dangerous lifestyle including being attacked.Director Robert Rossen made the film after times dominated by Mccarthyism in the U.S. and brought socially bankrupt issues to the screen such as pool hustling, gambling, alcoholism and suicide. (Packard commits suicide).Look out for great performances by Jackie Gleason as fellow pool player 'Minnesota Fats'. What a name, that was used by a real pool player in the 1970s and Eddie's domineering 'manager/gambler' Bert Gordon (George C. Scott).I made the error of watching Newman's mediocre 1980s follow up The Color Of Money (1986) which isn't a patch on this.As for Fast Eddie. The film like his hustling is a great up and down picture of his antics on and off the table. Highly recommended.",10,0,0,10 May 2020
Spotlight," Don't turn this film the other way
",The subject matter is revolting but the way it is exposed by reporters at the Boston Globe newspaper is excellent. The investigative journalism of the 'Spotlight' reporters of the Globe in revealing sordid child abuse amongst some members of the Roman Catholic Church reminded me of All The President's Men in the expose of Watergate.Michael Keaton is undergoing somewhat of a career renaissance from his superhero Batman days of the late 1980s here as chief Spotlight reporter Walter 'Robby' Robinson however it is co-star Mark Ruffalo as hot-headed reporter Mark Rezendes who displays the best scenes in arguments about publishing findings immediately before the full extent of the scandal in Boston is investigated.The film is not a witch hunt against honest members of the Roman Catholic Church it has other elements to the story. Most notably the 'turn the other way' attitudes of people in decades gone buy who could have exposed what was going on many years before. What I do find interesting about these true stories is the cards left on screen at the end. A sort of what happened next. A film that has to be viewed so hopefully this sort of thing never happens again and no organisation can cover it up.,7,0,0,30 April 2020
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino loves these modern twists on the Spaghetti Western genre
","The Hateful Eight is the eighth film directed by Quentin Tarantino. A director that has thus far delivered a filmography of fairly graphic violent, dialogue heavy productions that draw comparisons to other genres.The Hateful Eight obviously draws parallels to the spaghetti western films that become popular in the late 1960s and featured heavily violent scenes in a Western environment and made mainly by Italian/Spanish filmmakers.The film was notable on release in 2015 for being filmed in a 70mm film format rather than the standard 35mm that most films are made in. 70mm allows for a wider screen, more detailed shots apparently. I don't see the significance with this film. Aside from the first few minutes that show the breathtaking scenery of a snowbound, stormy Wyoming, U.S. location.The story features some excellent casting choices most notably Samuel L. Jackson in a quite customary role. He plays a bounty hunter that reminded me more of his role in Die Hard: With A Vengeance with his seemed hatred of whites and use of the N word. Kurt Russell plays another bounty hunter, John Ruth who is transporting his captive Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the town of Red Rock.As the weather worsens outside into a stormy blizzard Ruth in his stagecoach takes shelter at a seemed bed and breakfast like location that the rest of the 'long' film is set in, Minnie's Haberdashery. The Haberdashery is the location as a group of highly dangerous, suspicious looking individuals take shelter. Each one armed, ready to kill each other. However where is the film going. It certainly takes a couple of hours for the impasse at the Haberdashery to take place at which I was left asking that very question to myself. It is only in the final act that the plot thickens. A good plot but difficult to maintain concentration for such a long time.The film is as standard with Tarantino films dialogue heavy and consistent with his films in having memorable set pieces. The violence can be quite graphic and is not for the squeamish viewer. I am certainly glad I viewed the film although I would struggle to do so in a single sitting. An intermission is needed and was provided on its cinema release. In my case the intermission was overnight.",7,0,1,14 November 2019
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Great buddy casting. The screenplay and photography are a triumph.
","The casting of Paul Newman and Robert Redford as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance respectively was a stroke of movie casting genius.Newman and Redford are the Morecambe and Wise if the movies I've learned over the past few days after watching this and The Sting (1973) from the same director, George Roy Hill.Add a Western story of a couple of outlaws, couple of train robbers cum bank robbers and some cinematography that harked back to older John Ford films and you have a great film.Like The Sting you have a buddy picture better than most others. Some great comic lines. 'What do you mean, you can't swim' as the outlaws face a sheer fall into rapids below whilst being pursued to an inevitable death unless they jump.A great screenplay, photography, music by Burt Bacharach quite rightly were awarded with Oscars.As for George Roy Hill his time would come four years later with The Sting.He adds some sepia images to add some periodicity to proceedings.",8,0,0,20 April 2020
Barry Lyndon," Criminally (not by Barry on this occasion) overlooked Kubrick work
","Stanley Kubrick film that is criminally overlooked in his relatively small filmography of great films.Lyndon is a part historical cum period drama yarn based on the book The Luck of Barry Lyndon of 1844 by William Thackeray.
A three hour epic that doesn't seem like your watching such a long film. Every scene endures in the memory. Be it contributions from the cast and/or the many filmmaking talents some of the best British cinema has produced.I am talking not only of Kubrick himself, but the likes of legendary set designer Ken Adam, who no doubt the more Bondian fans will fondly remember.
Each scene is quite literally like a classical painting it appears! In terms of locations used, lighting and camera angles used by Kubrick.
Even NASA lenses were used to elicit more light from candlelit interiors.Kubrick films are known for their legendary use of classical music (2002: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange spring to mind). Barry Lyndon has the same musical history.",10,1,1,24 December 2019
Rocky II," Serviceable sequel. A rare breed. A sequel that delivers.
","Serviceable sequel to the original Rocky film that although shot three years later carries on immediately from the first 'Superfight' of that film that saw Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) as the underdog challenger lose narrowly to the world heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).Sequel syndrome usually means they aren't quite as good as the original.
It is the case with Rocky II but you still have a darn entertaining film.Of course the film culminates in 'Superfight II' and I won't spoil the result for anybody who hasn't seen the film!The training montages usually are the highlight of any Rocky film and this doesn't disappoint.I have an issue with the boxing choreography which when compared to other films of the genre looks poor. The punches clearly make no contact.As for characters, I have an issue with the character of Paulie, Rocky's brother-in-law (Burt Young).
He seems to be in the background of far too many influential scenes and is a bit of a distraction to be fair.Bill Conti returns for music score composition and his disco beats are uplifting especially in the training montages. 'Gonna Fly Now' being a highlight.Stallone writes and directs the film. You really believe he has the intelligence level of his Rocky character!It's a hit from me overall despite my picky protestations.",7,0,0,23 April 2020
Forrest Gump," If only life was interesting as this box of chocolates!
","The biggest picture of 1994 and one I only got round to watching last night in 2019, some 25 years later. Why had I left it so long? Several reasons which I will list in no particular order:1) Tom Hanks. I must admit to not been particularly endeared to the actor although I have seen several good films in his filmography.2) The running time of well over 140 minutes has always put me off.3) Clips showing Hanks as the title character, Forrest Gump muttering phrases such as 'Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know quite what your gonna get..'Anyway actually watching it took me through the interesting life of a fictional character Gump, a man with low I.Q. but who has lived closely through several notable points in U.S. history up to 1994:1. Elvis Presley's dancing routine which a childhood Gump inadvertently introduces to the King whilst limping in leg braces.2. Serving in the bloody battlefields of the Vietnam War. Single handedly rescuing half his platoon and introducing fascinating characters including his wounded Platoon Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).3. Meeting several U.S. Presidents including JFK as a member of his college football team, and Richard Nixon when being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.
In the process witnessing the Watergate break in whilst staying at the Watergate Hotel at the recommendation of Nixon!4. His 'love' interest throughout the film Jenny Curran contracting an incurable virus in the early 1980s after a lifestyle of drug addiction? AIDS?5. A segment including a TV interview with the late John Lennon.It was funny seeing Gump interwoven into old footage of famous people from the past 40 years or so.Director Robert Zemekis, the man who brought Back To The Future to cinema audiences was behind this film and crowd pleasing elements of that film can be seen in Forrest Gump.Tom Hanks delivers a great performance showing and narrating Forrest Gump's life on a bus stop bench to fascinated passers by.The running time actually goes quite fast.
The supporting cast including Sinise deliver excellent performances and add to Gump's fascinating lifestory.",8,0,1,25 April 2019
Fargo," How far do I have to go? Yar.
","How far do I have to go to watch brilliant cinema?
Fargo, the 1996 film from the Cohen Brothers' is lauded as the magnum opus of their cinematic work up to that point.I disagree with the assessment at the time of many observers. Mildly entertaining black comedy interwoven with several murders and a criminal plot by a financially struggling car dealer Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy).The locations of North Dakota and Minnesota make for a snowy backdrop that is perfectly lensed by cinematographer Roger Deakins.Contrasted with the dripping blood of murder victims and hapless criminals led by Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Peter Stormare (Gaear Grimsrud).The one shining light of this film is the performance of Frances McDormand as pregnant police officer Marge Gunderson.Gunderson pieces together the hapless criminality of the other characters in kidnapping the wife of Lundegaard in order for her rich father to hopefully pay out a ransom that supposedly will be used to pay off the criminals and Jerry Lundegaard at the same time.A pretty short runtime doesn't allow any boredom to set in. The black comedy of the hapless crooks and their associates. The Scandinavian derived accent of the locals can be mildly entertaining or annoying!The characters are pretty geeky in their dialogue. Steve Buscemi is Steve Buscemi.",7,0,0,21 July 2019
Notting Hill," Surreal, but nice!
","Notting Hill is a romantic comedy or rom-com from 1999 made by a successful production company (Working Title) and written by an equally successful screenwriter of the time, Richard Curtis.The team had been behind another successful rom-com of the 1990s, Four Weddings And A Funeral.It is as the title unoriginally suggests set in the Notting Hill area of London. An affluent area some would say yet at the same time home of immigrants and the annual carnival. It is also the home of a bustling market. I digress!Back to the film. Anyway, Hugh Grant plays a travel book shop owner William Thacker who lives within walking distance of his shop conveniently. A shop that isn't particularly financially successful.Grant has a couple of failed marriages to his name and lives in a terraced house with a rather scruffy, yet likeable Welsh lodger Spike (Rhys Ifans).The film has all the traits of the rom-com film at hand. You could say it is split into three distinct acts:
1. Boy Meets Girl
2. Boy loses girl
3. Boy wins her back and everybody lives happily ever after!The boy in question is really a man, Thacker! Although Grant plays Thacker with his usual rather tedious surreal but nice attitude. He's done it in several of his films before and after.The girl, or lady is successful Hollywood actress Anna Scott played by Julia Roberts.
Now the meet-cute scene is classic rom-com staple. Scott is in London and happens to browse the bookshelves of Thacker's book shop. Although his initial attempts at link-selling leave a lot to be desired!All I can explain about the scene is surreal but nice!Grant struggles against the media frenzy that follows Scott and her movie enterouge, at one point pretending to be from Horse and Hound magazine!Thacker introduces Scott to his wacky relatives/friends at dinner. The supporting cast here includes the likes of Hugh Bonneville.Now there are obstacles to the relationship developing. Not least the fame and 'adulation' that follows Scott at every turn. The media frenzy and tabloid revelations about old videos.The obstacles also come in the form of a supposed relationship with a fellow actor, cue a cameo by Alec Baldwin.Scott seemingly has little independance but shows Thacker a good time. In one scene breaking into a Notting Hill square garden over locked railings whilst Thacker struggles ala Alan Partridge!The casting is a high point of the film. Grant is a regular at these roles throughout his career and Roberts probably had her most successful role to date in Pretty Woman.Rather than a gay best friend, Thacker confides his concerns to his relatives/friends including Ifans who is funny as Spike.
Now Thacker loses Scott whilst she faces her media demons and cross Atlantic way of life.Cue a musical montage scene where Grant walks through the Notting Hill market to his shop through several changing seasons to depict the passage of time. For the musical geeks out there the track in question is Ain't No Sunshine by Bill Withers.
The soundtrack also features some brothers Gibb input and Ronan Keating.Thacker faces his moment of despair around the 3/4 point of the movie toward the end of the second act.The final act sees Grant racing through London traffic aided by his friends to reach Scdott's latest press conference at the Savoy Hotel. Horse and Hound is back!
The inevitable outpouring of love occurs and Thacker and Scott appear to live happily ever after!",8,5,5,15 February 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Critics 0 Fans 1
","Biopic of the hugely popular/successful pop band Queen and the late singer Freddie Mercury, who died of AIDS in 1991.Now this film has been criticised by some clever clog critics for its apparent lack of Freddie hedonism story.
I strongly disagree. The descent into orgies, homosexuality and AIDS is all covered. Along with the little known story of Freddie's wife Mary Austin.The actors give great performances as the band members especially Rami Malek as Mercury. They look so believable. Malek even wears some kind of denture device to mimic the famous Freddie overbite.In a way that is one of the strengths of the film. It chronicles the rise, fall and rise again of the GROUP leading up to the 1985 Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in London where Queen quite literally stole the show.
The Wembley scenes are so realistic.As a story of Queen rather than Freddie himself the film is a triumph revealing some interesting facts such as the songwriters of some of their most famous songs such as I'm In Love With My Car!The film will appeal to Queen fans as a chronicle of their greatest hits. A guilty pleasure!A troubled production behind the scenes apparently for several documented reasons. What influence did certain ex band members have?",8,3,4,19 January 2019
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Classic Robin Williams example
","In a year that saw a glut of Vietnam War films Good Morning, Vietnam provided some light relief.Light relief in the form of the performance of the central character. Radio disc-jockey Adrian Cronauer (played by the late Robin Williams). Cronauer arrives in the war torn region to provide some comic relief to war weary soldiers on U.S. forces radio in 1965. He instantly becomes a cult figure with his early morning broadcasts and the trademark call sign 'Good Morning, Vietnam!'It is funny seeing the zany Williams in action irritating the U.S. army top brass as well as entertaining the troops. Director Barry Levinson let Williams ad-lib some of his performance. To be fair how could you script half of it! At first I found the motormouth performance slightly irritating but it grew on me during the film.Williams was such a talented individual and his performance here is a template for some of his other work such as Mrs. Doubtfire.",8,0,0,30 April 2020
The Italian Job," A worthy remake of the classic
","I am a big fan of the 1969 original classic, The Italian Job so I originally watched this remake with some scepticism that it would reach such highs.Many of the plot elements that made the original such a classic are here but some are missing! The small Mini car in the guise of the newer version is here and the film showcases some excellent driving stuntwork routines.The film differs from the original in that the 'Italian Job' is at the start of the film and is located in the city of Venice rather than Turin.One of the robbers, Steve (Edward Norton) betrays his fellow gang members and steals millions of dollars worth of gold bullion murdering gang chief Donald Bridger (Donald Sutherland) in the process.The rest of the film is based in Los Angeles and shows the efforts of the rest of the gang to get the gold back, avenge Mr. Bridger and kill Steve in the process!The film has a decent cast including action movie stalwart Jason Statham, Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker and Charlize Theron as Donald Bridger's daughter, Stella. The film also borrows from the original in that a big city's computer controlled traffic system is hacked although computer technology has evolved since 1969!Not quite as 'British' as the original. Jason Statham is the only Brit in the cast I believe and he is hardly Michael Caine class.The bodywork on those poor Minis after going through their driving stunt paces!",6,0,0,21 May 2019
The Color of Money," 7 stars for a 9 ball pool delight
","Enjoyable mid 1980s yarn from director Martin Scorsese starring two of the biggest names in cinema, a youthful Tom Cruise and a great, aged Paul Newman (now sadly late) reprising a role made famous from The Hustler (1961) as maverick pool hustler 'Fast' Eddie Felson.Now I have as yet to watch that well regarded film. Whilst this may not have the same critical acclaim it is still an enjoyable film. Not a direct sequel.Newman's performance won him the Best Actor Academy Award in 1987. Good it was but a part of me thinks more a lifetime achievement award?Felson is now an aged, liquor salesman who spots some of his early talent in Vincent (Tom Cruise). Coaching and mentoring Vincent Eddie also gets his love of the sport back culminating in a performance at a pool tournament in Atlantic City.Cruise delivers one of his earliest performances and I enjoyed it for what it's worth! Also look out for solid supporting performances from Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Vincent's partner Carmen.The film boasts a typical synthesizer charged eighties soundtrack that even has some Phil Collins!I was a little surprised to see that Scorsese directed. There are no Italian American gangster stock actors such as Robert De Niro, Al Pacino or Joe Pesci in sight. All in all a more mainstream film from Scorsese to be honest.Watching this has made the anticipation for The Hustler even greater!",7,0,0,3 February 2020
North by Northwest," Hitchcock can do action!
","Excellent Alfred Hitchcock film that really is ahead of its time. I say that in several respects which I will allude to.The film from 1959 is about an innocent man (Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill). Thornhill gets mistaken for a U.S. secret agent in a chase across the country that involves scenes of death, amazing action sequences of suspense and the love of an attractive female. I've heard of Cary Grant of course but I admit to never seeing any of his many films. He immediately reminded me of Sir. Roger Moore with his suave demeanour, one liners whilst under pressure and getting the girl.Hitchcock films are of course well known for their technical wizardry. North By Northwest doesn't disappoint in this respect. Simple scenes of cars and the interior of train carriages filmed in the studio look realistic long before CGI ever existed.The film has several dramatic action sequences that wouldn't have looked out of place in a modern spy film. I'm thinking of a chase sequence whilst being followed by an overhead crop duster and scenes in Mount Rushmore. The film has comedic moments intertwined with scenes of murder.Look out for Thornhill acting the fool at an auction. I never expected to be as entertained by such an old film.",10,1,1,30 April 2020
The Shining," Nicholson is a shining light...again.
","The first time I had ever got around to watching this much celebrated horror from 1980. Based on a Stephen King novel.With a cast that includes Jack Nicholson as an alcoholic Jack Torrance and Shelley Duvall as his poor wife Wendy Torrance.Jack (how weird is it having the character and actor with the same name?) gets a job as winter caretaker at an isolated hotel in the Colarado mountains called the Overlook Hotel.The Hotel is snowed on and basically cut off from the rest of the world during the winter and has seen previous caretakers what shall I say, go mad. An axe murder several years before etc.Anyway Jack doesn't mind the isolation to get away from the alcohol demons as well as make progress with his literary career. The hotel is a series of grand sets at the United Kingdom's Elstree Studio.Jack moves his wife and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) with him. Over the next couple of hours Jack especially, Wendy and Danny all succumb to some sort of delusional behaviour.Nicholson has this unshaven, unkept look that along with his general demeanour anyway is just damn scary. Blood is shed, people are attacked and The Overlook Hotel is as isolated as ever.Add to the mix a great music score and direction by Stanley Kubrick and all the ingredients are there for a classic horror film. Nicholson is quickly becoming my favourite actor. Every film I have seen him star in from Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces, Chinatown and now this have been great.Kubrick adds the colour and camera angles from his other films such as A Clockwork Orange. The film is best renowned for Nicholsons scary scene shouting 'Here's Johnny!'",8,1,2,28 February 2017
American Beauty," Makes Coronation Street (U.K.) look like Sesame Street
","Late 1990s film about an upper middle class U.S. street that makes Coronation Street look like Sesame Street with its secrets and frustrations!You also have an Oscar winning Best Actor performance from controversial Kevin Spacey but let's consider the film itself.Spacey plays 42 year old Lester Burnham. He seems to be suffering from a mid-life crisis on that he is in a loveless marriage to Carolyn (Annette Bening), with one child who is at the puberty age, Jane (Thora Birch). Carolyn herself is an estate agent. Not a particularly successful one at that who faces 'competition' in the business from Buddy Kane (Peter Gallacher?).Lester has some going through the motions job in media. It contributes to the mortgage repayments kind of thing. Anyway his company is trying to make workforce cutbacks and he has to try and justify his employment.To the right of his house are a gay couple both called Jim. To the left is an ex-U.S. Marine Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper) with a 'secret' that is revealed in the film who has a controlling nature over his son, Ricky Fitts.Ricky is a dope dealer in his spare time (as you do) as well as having a strange/deranged habit of filming Jane through the windows, sometimes in private situations.Jane has a 'best' friend. A blonde, model-aspiring, good looking school friend of a character called Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari).That just about provides the ambience of the neighbourhood! The film shows 42 year old Lester (scary) develop a crush on Angela. Going on a keep-fit regime and developing a dope habit in the process. Also developing a new found confidence by telling his employers a few home truths hence losing his job, buying an old car and 'bashing the bishop' in bed next to his wife!Director Sam Mendes is probably more well known to audiences for his James Bond film collaborations Skyfall and Spectre but this his perhaps his career peak film.Watching the strange interaction between the characters develop and their messed up lives. The film develops into a shocking ending which I won't spoil but it is not what you expect!Spacey rightly or wrongly won the Oscar and at this time is probably his best performance aside The Usual Suspects from 1995. If you have not seen this film, I strongly recommend.",8,1,3,27 May 2019
Rocky IV," Franchise returns to form (on repeated viewings)
","Now I must admit to having initial misgivings to the fourth entry in the Rocky franchise but on repeated viewings it has greatly grown on me.The film was made at the height of the Cold War and has an element of U.S.A. vs Soviet Union tensions demonstrated by James Brown singing Living In America!The casting of Dolph Lundgren as Soviet Union nemesis Ivan Drago is a masterstroke as he looks like a machine and mumbles about twenty words of dialogue through the film.He delivers some classic lines such as 'if he dies, he dies ' as he kills an old character from the series (spoiler).The soundtrack is a great mid 1980s synthesizer filled delight. There are several great songs to accompany Rocky in some obligatory training montages in remote Russia (Canada).At one point cash rich Rocky buys Paulie a robot. Yes a robot to try and make his character more interesting?",7,1,1,24 April 2020
The Usual Suspects," Classic 1990s film. Who killed Keyser Söse?
","Clever film about a group of US criminals from 1995.I say clever in that the screenplay is so good.
If you have the opportunity I would recommend a repeat viewing a day or two after.I did and you spot so many little details and twists that after a sole viewing you might miss.The premise is quite simple really. A group of 'suspects' are arrested by the New York Police Department on pretty dubious information regarding a stolen truck and end up in the notorious identity parade.Back in a holding cell the group of 5 hatch a plan for further criminal activity to get one over the NYPD.All the story is told from the interrogation of one of the suspects Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey).The identity of a mysterious boss Keyser Söse becomes a main plot thread throughout.
The cast includes Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin and a young Benicio Del Toro.The film oozes quality and was deserving of its box office success back in 1995.",8,0,0,23 October 2019
Quantum of Solace," A bit of a let down Daniel Craig Bond film
","As a big Bond fan I was left a bit disappointed. The film does seem disjointed. However on repeat viewing it does improve.I mean the gunbarrel sequence at the end of the film?The plot in order to accomodate the locations is muddled and as for the title song. The background to the track is okay. Its when the lyrics and singing are added that I don't like it. A voiceless instrumental of this track would have sufficed.Bond films are about the mad villains with their plans for worldwide domination not control of Bolivias water supply! Who cares about that?
The shaky camera work is quite nauseating at times.I missed the traditional gun barrel sequence at the beginning of the film along with a title sequence from traditional post Maurice Binder helmer Daniel Kleinman.Recent entries have a longer running time.
Marc Foster, the director goes for a shorter run time. High in action but low in substance.Some good action sequences but a mediocre plotline make for a disjointed James Bond film.",6,1,1,26 March 2020
Days of Thunder," Top Gun part 2 (Not Maverick!)
","Days of Thunder follows pretty much the same vein as Top Gun, up until Mission Impossible his biggest success.It is made by the same filmmakers as Top Gun, late director Tony Scott and the Simpson/Bruckheimer production team.Cruise plays a NASCAR driver Cole Trickle. A young, rash at times, dangerous character like the one he plays in Top Gun, Maverick.The similarities don't end there. You have a love interest (a very Australian Doctor played by a young Nicole Kidman) and an older mentor in the shape of Robert Duvall as mechanic Harry.The scenes of the NASCAR races at circuits such as Daytona are pure testosterone like the dog fights in Top Gun!Casting is good. Cruise, Kidman (later Mrs. Cruise), Duvall and the guy off Cliffhanger, Hal.The film is not a classic by any stretch but is good escapist entertainment.",6,1,1,19 October 2019
Bridesmaids," Chick-flick comedy that has easy thinking funny moments
","2011 comedy about a U.S. wedding preparation and the shenanigans of the bridal party, the maid of honour and the bridesmaids.
The film explores inadvertent jealousy between the brides oldest friend, Annie (Kristen Wiig) and a rich new friend on the block Helen (Rose Byrne).
The bride in the middle of all this is Lillian (Maya Rudolph).The movie is surprisingly funny at times. I never thought I would find a group of Bridezillas hilarious but there are several funny scenes.
The cast is littered with comics. Mainly American but the likes of Matt Lucas (U.K.) and Rebel Wilson (Australia) are cast.
One of the main writers is the main stars character Annie (Kristen Wiig).
The director Paul Feig has quite an extensive filmography of mainly 'chick-flick' comedies and does an admirable job here.",7,1,2,22 April 2019
The Favourite," Overrated historical quasi comedy romp.
","Enjoyable part historical royal yomp, rather overrated by the serious film critics about the court of the last Stuart monarch, Queen Anne (Olivia Colman).Basically we see an illness ridden Queen Anne who spends most of the film confined to her bed chamber that becomes a focal point location for some of the more sexual scenes that follow.The Favourite of the title refers to Anne's favourite in my opinion and I'm not just talking as a conventional lady in waiting. In terms of their sexual performance?They are Lady Marlborough (Rachel Weisz) her 'loyal' lady in waiting whose husband Lord Marlborough is abroad in battle versus the French and young upstart Abigail (Emma Stone).Stone begins the film as a penniless waitress to Lady Marlborough but promotes to a Lady by conveniently marrying. She worms her way into the bed chamber of the Queen putting Lady Marlborough in a rage.The jealous side battle between Lady Marlborough and Abigail becomes a major part of the film. Who rises victorious?
Some good performances by the leads, excellent set design and cinematography are plus points of the film but let it be known. I think this film is overrated. Seriously.",7,4,9,12 February 2019
28 Days Later...," Zombie horror brought back to the mainstream in a non-comedic way
","2002 film, directed by Danny Boyle of Trainspotting fame. This film brings zombie horror back to the mainstream. Not in a comedic way like Shaun Of The Dead but showing a bleak British Isles post infection with a rage blood borne infection that has wiped out most of the 60 million or so population within 28 days of it escaping a laboratory at the beginning of the film, hence the title.If you have ever seen the television film, Threads where a post nuclear apocalypse occurs in Cold War Britain this film is similar.There are a few scattered people that are not infected, struggling to survive like scavenges. The only caveat to their mundane life being able to raid supermarket shelves like the gameshow Supermarket Sweep and loot the most expensive bottled whisky!The film cleverly shows deserted London landmarks such as Westminster Bridge and Piccadilly Circus. The streets in a quiet,(unknown in bustling London) deserted state. Quickly filmed in cleared streets in the pre morning rush hour in when dawn is early.Boyle uses digital cameras to aid the quick setting up of such scenes in a wsy that traditional 35mm cameras wouldn't allow. The digital photography isn't quite as clear as traditional film and adds to the bleakness of the environment.Danny Boyle is adding quite a filmography. The aforementioned Trainspotting and its sequel. 127 Hours, Slumdog Millionaire. All good films.",8,0,1,18 May 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," The greatest epic you will see. A cinephiles dream.
","Not just a good film but an event film for the serious cinephile. Lawrence of Arabia is breathtaking.An epic not just in length (nearly 4 hours) but in location. Filmed in a desert environment that is perfectly captured with its 70mm print.
I have a large TV screen but I would love to see this film where it is meant to be seen, at a cinema. Minute details such as specks on the horizon of the desert could easily be missed on a TV viewing.So, what is it roughly about?
It concerns the World War I exploits of British army officer T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) as he helps the Arabians against the Turkish.
As the film develops we see him gaining legendary status amongst his band of Arabian fighters.The casting, location photography and music score are a delight.
Music by Maurice Jarre and the London Philharmonic Orchestra.
The desert scenes do drag on but the music keeps the film ticking over.O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guiness ALL deliver perfect performances.
Director David Lean delivers the greatest epic I have seen to date.",10,0,0,15 November 2019
The Elephant Man," A black and white modern era triumph
","1980 saw a couple of films released in a black and white format.The Elephant Man was one. The black and white adds to the ambience of the Victorian London the film is set in.Anthony Hopkins (with hair) plays a surgeon at a London hospital who befriends and at the same time discovers John Merrick (John Hurt) nicknamed 'Elephant Man' because of his grotesque physical appearance due to tumours.Make-up effects transform Hurt into Merrick. It must have taken many hours for his make-up to be applied to achieve the desired effect.Hurt is unrecognizable and follows his famous role in Alien only one year previously.Director duties fall to David Lynch who earned an Oscar nomination and in the process increased his film making profile.Look out for a small role from the late Michael Elphick, who U.K. watchers may recognize from television roles such as Boon.Hurt and Hopkins are excellent in their roles and elevate the film to greatness.",8,0,0,2 May 2020
A Quiet Place," Silence is golden?
","I would class the film in a category that a I made up after watching IT, kiddie horror.It tells the story of a post apocalyptic world ala Mad Max and a family in particular that live in a seemingly deserted town in the U.S. like mormons.A father and mother Lee and Evelyn (director John Krasnski and his real life wife Emily Blunt), a son Marcus (Noah Jupe), and deaf daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds).Whenever a sound is made predators that look like the prawn creatures off District 9 appear and eat!The family communicate by sound language to aid silent communication and to communicate with Regan, who also has high frequency hearing aids.The town is deserted and it appears everyone else has died from one reason or another.Basically that is the premise, silence or scary creatures. Accidental sounds lead to a couple of set pieces with the creatures who Regan discovers are disabled from the high frequency sounds of her hearing aids.A 'complication' is added to the plot. Evelyn is pregnant. (Didn't they make a noise in fornication?)How will Evelyn stay quiet when her waters break and the pain and agony of childbirth? Quell another set piece.More a thriller than a horror.
The jump scares had minimal impact on me and I have seen it all before.",6,0,0,17 May 2020
Dog Day Afternoon," Grimy Brooklyn adds up to a dated film
","I will be honest.
The premise of a bank robbery going wrong and the robbers becoming 'celebrities' probably would have worked nowadays but this Sidney Lumet directed film from 1975 has aged.Not only in terms of its lead (Al Pacino as Sonny) but in terms of grimy Brooklyn, the technology of the outside news broadcast...I could go on.The film has elements of black comedy following the hapless exploits of the robbers cum hostage negotiators.Somehow Lumet gained an Oscar nomination for his direction where as today the film would struggle to be a B picture.I became bored if I am honest by the monotony of the screenplay.I really had no compunction about what happened to the leads Sonny and Sal (Pacino and John Cazale).",6,0,2,14 April 2020
Hidden Figures," Feel good movie - the type that Costner revels in!
","Feel good film about the space race between the then USSR and US to launch a man into space.The US space agency relies on pre-IBM technology to come up with the complex numbers for their mission and to that end a team consisting of three brilliant African American scientists (played by unknown actresses).Unfortunately some rather racial undertones still exist in pre-Martin Luthor King America that includes segregated toilets meaning a 40 minute trip to relieve themselves for one of the unfortunate ladies. Leader of the NASA mission Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) is shocked to hear of this and personally destroys the segregation. 'At NASA we all pee the same colour!'The first US Astronaut the late John Glenn is seen successfully entering earths orbit and re-entering our atmosphere thanks partly to the ladies calculations. Costner seems to revel in these JFK era films. I must have watched three where he plays almost identical characters. (Thirteen Days, JFK and Hidden Figures). A good watch and worthy of award recognition beyond more highly hyped films.",7,1,6,28 February 2017
Annie Hall," Autobiographical Allen monologue.
","I admit to holding some misconceptions about Woody Allen.I have never watched any of his work. Only seeing brief clips of films like Annie Hall. A film that won 4 Oscar awards.So the film I knew was highly rated. It seems to be a semi-autobiographical story of Allen under the pseudonym of a character called Alvy Singer. A New York, Jewish comedian with a penchant for tennis, intellectual films and books.The film is really about Singer's relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Again is this true to Allen's life story and relationship with Diane Keaton (born Diane Hall and nicknamed Annie)?For the first few minutes of the film I thought I was watching some screwball motor mouth monologue from Allen.Throughout the film Singer talks directly at the camera looks back at historic points in his life, such as at school and living in a house under a wooden rollercoaster.The film now looks dated. New York is its grimy 1970s worst especially when compared to the sunny scenes set in Los Angeles.There are early film appearances from the likes of Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum, and a long haired Paul Simon.",6,0,2,24 October 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," A film that left me so angry like no other!
","A film has never left me so angry. Confused. Brain aching.
I really wanted to understand it but I was left with more questions than answers.Director Stanley Kubrick has delivered some great films, films which I've often rated highly. One thinks of The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut, his black and white opus Paths Of Glory starring Kirk Douglas.For many 2001 is a career peak for Kubrick though. The 1968 production just doesn't hit those highs for me.It is a long film. Slow moving but not an epic length film like Gone With The Wind or even The Godfather films.Anyway, back to 2001.
It has good points. Some excellent set design of the interiors of the space station and special effects of space exploration. A deserved Oscar win for Kubrick's special effects. Remember in a film era before CGI.
The effects have aged a little but still hold up. Remember it was over fifty years ago.The beginning of the film or Dawn Of Man sequence doesn't seem to be linked to modern/future space exploration rather Planet Of The Apes as pre-humanoids battle in tribes over food and water.
However we see the use of weapons for the first time as the bones of a rotting carcass of a zebra like creature are used by one tribe against the other.Excellent set design, matte backgrounds and ape costumes like Planet Of The Apes.
A strange black monolith appears supposedly from nowhere. It reminded me more of the Ed stone from the 2015 UK General Election. What is it? Where did it come from? First unanswered question.Cut to 'modern' day supposedly set in 2001!
Tourists travel to an orbiting space station aboard a Pan Am branded vehicle wearing 'grip shoes' to counteract the effects of gravity. Clever product placement and gadgetry like an old James Bond film. Virgin Galactic take note!Now the space exploration takes place that I link this film to. All set to classical music.
The music at first is 'relaxing' but st times over used and quite frankly annoying.From a moonbase, strange happenings are being covered up including the appearance of another multi million year old monolith buried beneath the surface of the moon that seemingly is emitting signals towards the largest planet in the solar system, Jupiter. Quell a multi year voyage there.The voyage to Jupiter (not the moon as in the 1901 film) is where some semblance of story develops.
Manned by two live astronauts Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) an three further astronauts in 'suspended animation'. There life systems computer controlled and set to the bare minimum to conserve energy needs and therefore food. Placed into the state pre voyage?A state of the art IBM computer, the HAL9000 controls most actions on the ship.
However Bowman and Poole think strange things are happening. Is it the work of HAL?The suspicious activity continues as the ship nears Jupiter. Here the film lost me in a psycadhelic haze as Bowman enters Jupiter's gaseous atmosphere?Then we see Bowman in a room seeing himself age and see another monolith.The film ends as some floating starchild foetus hovers over planet earth to the chords of classical music like the start of the film.Totality confused!",4,1,4,5 May 2019
Midsommar," Aster at last provides 2019 with a decent film
","A 2019 new release film from director Ari Aster that evoked memories of a 1970s film banned for 20 years or so.Only Aster's second feature, following 2018's Hereditary, a film that for many (not myself) brought comparisons to The Exorcist.Midsommar instantly evokes comparisons to the classic Christopher Lee film, The Wicker Man with pagan cults and a palette of colour throughout.The colour is provided by a midsummer festival in Sweden, not the usual dark photography of a 'horror' film.
The film also avoids the usual horror film cliches of jump scares and mood lighting.A rather long run time for a film of the genre at over 140 minutes. The extended run time allows for some plot development surrounding the characters which I will come on to.Without bringing major spoilers to the review the film involves a group of American students, two of whom Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor) are a couple experiencing relationship issues involving a family tragedy.Christian has a circle of Inbetweeners like freinds some of whom provide comic relief throughout the film. I'm thinking of Mark (Will Poulter).A 'lads' break to the festival is planned but Dani, inadvertently is tagged along.
What follows is a 'trip' the group could not imagine. A drug induced, time confusing period of some quite disturbing scenes.The film does have some gory sequences yet members of the cinema audience did snigger.Featuring some quite scary lookalikes including Bjorn from Swedish pop group Abba and Jeremy Corbyn!2019 has been a poor year thus far cinematically, probably as of July 2019 one, if not the best film.The Wicker Man had a legend in the late Christopher Lee. Midsommar doesn't. The casting is pretty low key but effective.
Not a conventional horror more a psychological drama with a smuttering of comedy.",10,13,20,6 July 2019
Woman in Gold," How do you solve a problem like Maria-still?

Mirren as usual is the Queen of all she surveys. How do you solve a problem like Maria? was a famous song in fellow Austrian film The Sound of Music. The question is answered throughout the movie!A film that's only weakness is the inevitable ending.

Eyes Wide Shut," One last hurrah from Kubrick evokes memories
","Legendary director Stanley Kubrick's last film. Delivered to film distributor Warner Bros. some four days before his death after a laborious 400 day shoot.In ways typical Kubrick. However this film has erotic undertones. Indeed the two main characters were married in real life at the time.I have mixed views of Kubrick films. He is a cinema legend up there with the likes of Hitchcock in my opinion.In ways this is a thriller that reminded me of a Hitchcock film with an adult undertone.
Cruise plays a doctor, Doctor Harford who is shaken by a drug fuelled revelation by his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman).What follows is a seedy night of events as the doctor tries to come to terms with the revelation.I say seedy. Fears of homosexuality, under age sex, prostitution, HIV infection and murder are all covered briefly as the revelation keeps flashing in his mind. That of a fantasy of his wife.The film has excellent set design and a simple but effective musical score, including classical music that is pure Kubrick. I am thinking of 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange.It is a film that evokes memories of some Hitchcockian mysterious screenplay.",8,1,1,7 April 2019
Pretty Woman," Feel good Julia Roberts 'debut'
","Romantic comedy from 1990 starring Richard Gere as a rich businessman Edward Lewis who happens to hire the services of Los Angeles prostitute Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts).The arrangement begins with simple directions, to personally driving Edwards Lotus sportscar to staying overnight at the swish Regent Beverley Wiltshire Hotel to eventually staying as Edward's companion for the entire week of his stay.The film airs on the comic side in scenes where downmarket prostitute Vivian mixes with the rich elite of Beverley Hills.
The film ends like a fairy tale for her as she is offered the chance of a new life away from her poverty lifestyle.The soundtrack is particularly good with songs from the likes of Roy Orbison to Go West and Roxette (it is nigh on 27 years old now!)The film marks the big break for actress Julia Roberts who would go on to become one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood.The screenplay has some great lines that I couldn't possibly repeat but even my action/horror/serious cinematic tastes were left amused by the film on first viewing on its cinematic release in Australia in 1990 to present day.",8,1,2,7 August 2019
Rocky III," Franchise territory come in. Makes for less of an impact?
",Okay I get the feeling with this film that Rocky has entered franchise territory and the film makers are cashing in on the character.The film begins with Rocky installed as world heavyweight boxing champion and on a ten fight defence of his title.The character seems to be cashing in on his success with lucrative product placements and charity appearances including a funny fight against wrestling champion Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan).The film has a new angle with Rocky changing his lifestyle and training habits with the influence of a certain Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).As in earlier entries the boxing choreography is quite poor when considering that Sylvester Stallone receives a screen credit for it is understandable I suppose.Rocky is more athletic towards the end of the film allowing plenty of muscular boxing posing.A bit of a let down on the highs and quite good highs of the first two films respectively.One high point is the soundtrack featuring the song 'Eye Of The Tiger' by Survivor. An excellent song.,6,0,0,23 April 2020
The Untouchables," Connery is the star of the enjoyable film.
","First time I have seen the cough (33 year old!) film about prohibition era Chicago and I enjoyed it. Unlike some of the more clever clog reviews.The Untouchables was originally a television series but director Brian De Palma brings a successful film adaptation.The film focuses on the gangland warfare between gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and Federal U.S. Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) brought into Chicago to snare Capone.Ness forms an 'Untouchables' police unit with an older and wise Irish-American Malone (Sean Connery) and Oscar Wallace, a young Cop George Wallace (Andy Garcia) and a federal IRS like accountant?The film is notable for the elaborate production design. I am thinking of scenes in 1930 Chicago including street scenes with period features, a Chicago courtroom and Chicago Grand Central railway station.A good musical score is presented by Ennio Morricone that has elements of his Once Upon A Time In The West work.I don't usually endear to Kevin Costner's career opus in the late 1980s/1990s but he delivers a good performance here. In fact all the cast do in particular Sean Connery who won an Academy Award for this.Al Capone is played by De Niro. Watching De Niro strutting around and smirking got me thinking. He plays the same character in a lot of his films! In particular some of his collaborations with director Martin Scorsese.Coming in at just under two hours, perhaps the film could have been beefed up with some other scenes?",8,0,0,18 January 2020
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a Wonderful film...not just at Christmas.
","I seem to be one of only a small number of people who haven't seen this film, which for many has become a staple Christmas movie.
I watched a decent colorized version of a film that was originally released in black and white back in 1946.The colorization technology on recent restoration of old films is very good and I couldn't tell I was watching an old black and white film.I digress. Why has the film gained cult like status?It stars James Stewart in the star role as a character George Bailey who has done good deeds throughout his life but now doubts his contribution to the world around him, making him contemplate suicide on Christmas Eve.
A trainee angel, Clarence literally saves him and in a parallel time line makes George realise what life would have been like without his interventions.George part owns a loan company which faces financial problems and the possible imprisonment of George unless $8000 can be found to pay off the shortfall.George saves his brother's life for example in 1919. His brother as an adult is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery in the Second World War.We see the actions of a greedy man Mr. Potter throughout the film. The opposite to George in helping the local towns population in owning their own homes. He comes across as an evil banker. Charging high rents for poor properties.In the angel Clarence's parallel timeline the local town Bedford Hills is renamed Pottersville.There is also a second story in the film. The angel Clarence is 'second class' and as yet has no wings. Saving George just may earn him his wings and elevate him to a 'normal' angel level.In the end George's fate is saved as the townfolk raise the cash and Potter, who attempts to have George jailed sees his warrant ripped up.A feel good film with some excellent performances.

A Beautiful Mind," Puts mental health to the forefront of cinema
","A Beautiful Mind. I cant believe its nearly twenty years old.
It is the story of mathematical genius John Nash who battles paranoid schizophrenia and eventually wins the Nobel Prize.The film has a stellar cast.Russell Crowe portrays Nash in a role that firmly elevated him to A list status in my opinion.
Other cast members include a young Paul Bettany, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly as Nashs' wife and veteran actor Christopher Plummer.Director Ron Howard tells the story of Nash in a thoughtful, emotional way, making full use of the cast at his disposal.The story of Nashs' battle with schizophrenia brings mental health to the forefront of cinema.The film is a forerunner of films like The Theory Of Everything and The Imitation Game.",9,1,2,14 November 2018
Psycho," Hitchcock delivers another triumph from a simple storyline
","Another classic Alfred Hitchcock directed film from 1960 featuring one of the most iconic scenes in cinematic history.
It may be over fifty years old but a good story holds up no matter what. Hitchcock certainly knew how to bring a simple, suspenseful story to the big screen.Shot in old black and white I wasn't expecting much. How wrong I was.Featuring a psychotic individual with multiple psychiatric conditions, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).
He slashes Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) in the famous shower scene only about half way through the film. The music reminded me of the iconic Jaws theme by John Williams. Composer Bernard Herrman was behind the iconic slash theme.The film brings iconic horror elements to the screen many years before the Halloween and Freddie Kreuger films.Talking of Halloween, John Gavin plays a character called Sam Loomis. Was this the inspiration for the Donald Pleasance character in the Halloween franchise?There are elements of cross dressing, taxidermy, murder, theft of $40,000.A classic film that doesn't take two and a half hours to tell the story.
Hitchcock delivers again.",9,1,1,6 October 2019
American Made," Cruise in below the radar 'literally' romp
","Tom Cruise has been round so long now I have learned from watching so many of his films recently.American Made certainly slipped under my movie watching radar which is quite ironic because the screenplay involves plenty of under the radar flying action!Cruise stars as TWA pilot Barry Seal in the late seventies. What follows is his journey into cash in hand CIA/Columbian drugs cartel pilot in light aircraft evading the American Drug Enforcement Agency in the process.The film has some historical nods to ex-U.S. politicians from President Carter, Reagan, Bush Snr, Governor of Arkansas then Bill Clinton and even Oliver North.South American drug lord Pablo Escabar and the Nicaragua situation is featured.Cruise still has a wife and kids back in his normal life to keep safe and happy despite his ever increasing commitments, dangerous lifestyle and a questionable brother-in-law JB.I've not enjoyed a Cruise film away from the Mission:Impossible franchise as much since Top Gun and Color Of Money.An underrated gem.",8,0,1,3 April 2020
There Will Be Blood," Excellent casting raise the bar of this film
","I watched this film expecting some masterpiece by what I had read however I was left distinctly underwhelmed.It is basically set in the early twentieth century as the vast land of the United States is mined for oil.Daniel Day Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, a Cliff Barnes (Dallas, RIP) like character who is the big positive of this film.He is a ruthless character. A capitalist who senses a quick few bucks and will do anything to achieve his aims it seems.Day Lewis characterisation of Plainview reminded me of his performance as Bill The Butcher in Gangs of New York.His ruthless streak is shown when he abandons his young son, HW.
He displays all the business skills of Donald Trump in promising ranch owners a future of paradise if they sell their oil fertile land to him to plunder for oil.One such landowner is Abel Sunday who has two identical twin sons Paul and Eli Sunday both played by Paul Dano who I saw in the excellent 2014 biopic of Brian Wilson, Love & Mercy.Eli is a self-proclaimed preacher/faith healer. The tension between Eli and Plainview explodes in several scenes throughout the film. Scenes that are tense and at times violent.The performance of the cast are what raises the bar of this film. Director Paul Thomas Anderson can be praised for delivering excellent scenes between them.However be warned. The film is quite lengthy and bleak.",6,1,4,27 April 2019
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Lean furnishes a jolly good film
","David Lean directed World War II nearly an epic at 161 minutes or so!
A precursor to his Lawrence of Arabia epic.The film focuses on mainly British Prisoner's Of War in a Burmese camp tasked with building a new railway bridge over the River Kwai, an epic engineering fete on the Singapore to Rangoon railway line.The film focuses primarily on the battle of wits between British commanding officer Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and under pressure Japanese camp leader Col. Saito.What follows are acts of bravery/jolly good British bravado against some sadistic treatment at the hands of the Japanese captors who disregard the Geneva Convention when it comes to officers partaking in manual workLean portrays the British throughout in a stiff upper lip way although this is counterbalanced by a musical score that brings a sense of national pride to the British viewer.The film has the obligatory American lead (Anthony Holden) as Shears. A cowardly U.S. Naval P.O.W.
Shears looks on at the British stiff upper lip attitude with amused contempt!Nicholson turns round the tables belittling the poor engineering of the Japanese to build the best bridge possible.
Meanwhile Shears escapes only to be recruited by the British to help blow up the bridge!The second half of the film is two stories. The building of the bridge versus the mission to destroy it leading to a culmination that is madness!Lean furnishes an entertaining film, that while not quite up to the standards of Lawrence of Arabia is still a good film.
Featuring great cinematography of the jungle environment, good musical score and good performances from the cast. Some who go on to appear in other classic War films such as The Great Escape.
One of Guiness' greatest performances.",8,0,0,12 December 2019
Whiplash," A compelling film. A feast for the viewer.
",One of the most compelling films of the last few months. 2015 just ceases to amaze cinematically.Andrew (Miles Teller) is a talented drummer at a New York music school driven to perfection by a domineering music teacher Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Fletcher's at times unconventional methods of improving his pupils ability can be construed as bullying.Andrew ditches his girlfriend and concentrates fully on his drumming in order to satisfy the 'bully' and gain entry into an elite class/jazz band and become one of the main players.Teller comes across a bit nerdy and boring. I think it is Fletcher who is the star of the film. Part psycho? His put downs of some of his 'failing' musical students are classic .J.K. Simmons is unknown (to me anyway!) but he steals the movie and deserves recognition. A battle of musical wits that quite literally draws sweat and blood is set between the two central characters.Not a blockbuster by any means but one if not the best film of recent times for its original screenplay and performances.,9,1,6,22 February 2015
The Terminal," Interesting bit of comedy drama from Spielberg
","Director Steven Spielberg collaborates with actor Tom Hanks in this comedy drama from 2004.Hanks plays Eastern European Viktor Navorski a resident of the fictional state of Krakhozia. Navorski is refused entry to New York when his homeland undergoes a military coup/war during his flight to the U.S. His passport is therefore not valid and the head of the border police orders him to stay in the International Departure Lounge of the airport!Armed with broken English, a few food vouchers and a pager in case he is needed by the authorities Navorski makes the lounge his home for months whilst the war is still raging. Along the way we meet a few other characters who regularly work in the terminal.A side story has Catherine Zeta-Jones appearing as a United Airlines hostess who Viktor develops a relationship with. I found some of these scenes distracted from the main story and were just included in the film to allow the casting of Zeta-Jones.Hanks is an actor I've never particularly endeared to but he plays Viktor well. I was a bit uncomfortable with the border authorities attitude towards someone with little to no English vocabulary skills! Apparently the story is inspired by the story of an Iranian refugee stuck in Paris Charles De Gaulle for years! I couldn't think of any worse situation. I hate airports at the best of time. They are just shopping malls!Spielberg is not particularly known for his comedy is he? In this film there are several perhaps inadvertent comedic moments such as Viktor looking into security cameras and pulling faces or staff playing cards for items of lost and found items! The film is pretty unique in my opinion. I've not seen a film like it before or since it's release in 2004. Interesting.",6,0,0,30 April 2020
Halloween," Carpenter magic brings slasher horror perfection.
","A film that introduced the cinematic world to character Michael Myers. A slasher psychopath that has become one of the most recognised characters in cinema.The film also introduced director John Carpenter to mainstream audiences. A director who oversaw the screenplay and musical score.What a score it is. Characterised by synthesizer sounds it adds to the tension of scenes just as much as John Williams does with his Jaws soundtrack.The film made in the late seventies for a modest budget brought slasher horror to the cinema. A genre that was imitated countlessly but not as suspenseful as this.Featuring a great cast including English legend Donald Pleasence (The Great Escape, You Only Live Twice) as Doctor Loomis. A savant like character who knows how dangerous Myers is.The film introduces Jamie Lee Curtis as teenage babysitter Laurie Strode who becomes Myers target of hate.The film features great steadicam shots of Michael's movements as a murderous six year old to the young adult killer who makes the journey from escaping a mental hospital to the town of Haddenfield to carry on his killing spree.Lee Curtis becomes the final girl character surviving multiple attempts at her life.
The film looks so much better on a big screen. Just as Carpenter wanted in all its majestic Panavision glory.Aged, but still a classic.",10,0,1,11 October 2018
Creed II," Rocky IV.2 as much as Creed II
","Creed II or Rocky IV.2 carries on many of the familiar themes of the Rocky franchise, most notably the film Rocky IV from 1985.Now many Rocky aficionados find Rocky IV the most entertaining of the original Rocky boxing franchise.Creed II finds lead character Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) face the demons of his late father Apollo Creed when the son of his father's killer (in the boxing ring) Ivan Drago, Viktor Drago comes on the bocing scene.Like Ivan in the 1980s, Viktor now is a biological freak when it comes to boxing. Bigger, more powerful than any other fighter in the world who threatens Adonis's worldwide domination of the 'sport'.The reappearance of old characters such as Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) and Ludmilla Drago (Brigette Nielson) is entertaining.The dialogue of some of the characters, in particular Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is sometimes difficult to decipher.The film is pretty formulaic. Indeed I would call it Rocky IV.2 at times in scenes involving rematches, crying wives and training montages in the middle of nowhere.
Fans of the genre will not be left disappointed however I can't see the Creed franchise developing further? Could be wrong!",7,2,2,26 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," George Lucas magical franchise launched
","What with the imminent release of the first of a new trilogy, what better excuse than to visit the first cinematic release. Even if it is number 4 or episode iv in an intended 9 films.The film was released back in 1977 when sci-fi had mostly involved television series and the odd film (2001: A Space Odyssey springs to mind).With a modest budget of £11m compared to the same years Bond film that had a £13.5m budget.
The film begins with a signature introduction much like other film franchises.
The film's popularity is that it has elements of several other genres in a galaxy far, far away.Westerns are represented in some of the locations including the Death Valley Monument and Tunisia.
An alien saloon provides an element of humour as well as harking back to a John Wayne cowboy scene.War films are represented by the spaceship dog fights like The Battle Of Britain perhaps.
Excellent miniatures and optical effects are on a par with 2001 as already mentioned.
The signature start and torture scene of a main character Princess Leia reminds me of the old Bond films.The cast is a mixture of new blood (in 1977) including Mark Hamill as the young hero Luke Skywalker and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.
Veteran screen actors are represented by greats such as Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Peter Cushing as the aptly named 'evil' Grand Moff Tarkin.
The casting of Cushing reminded me of his roles in the old Hammer horror films.
Characters have varied names, some mentioned already. Human, droid, a dog/carpet/hairy creature called Chewbacca, a wookie.
Jabba The Hut, a slimy, overweight gangster alien creature.The film has an element of popularity no doubt fuelled by sales of merchandise linked to the franchise.",8,0,0,3 December 2019
Saboteur," Glass half full Hitchcock still makes for a good film!
","I've watched far to much Alfred Hitchcock films. In my, and many other people's opinion they are works of genius!Looking at his extensive filmography there is still the odd guilty pleasure I have for whatever reason overlooked. Saboteur from 1942 is one such film.A second world war thriller from during the conflict. Set in the U.S. where Brit Hitchcock was under contract by David O. Selznick by then it deals with elements that were trademark facets of some of his better known films. The innocent man being on the run, chased by lawmen trying to prove his innocence.In this instance the innocent man is a factory worker, Barry Kane (Robert Cummings). Wrongly implicated for a fatal fire at the factory.Whilst on the run from California to New York, Kane ends up wooing a law abiding young lady, Pat Martin (Priscilla Lane). The pair do have a screen chemistry as the film develops.The real bad guys are like a group of terrorists in a James Bond film. Sabotaging not only the factory but a major ship launch in New York.If you have already watched more mainstream Hitchcock such as The 39 Steps a similar film follows but with a U.S. rather than U.K. setting.Not one of Hitchcocks best films but certainly not the worse, call it middle of the way. Glass half full Hitchcock is still good!",6,1,2,17 October 2019
Born on the Fourth of July," I won't say 'excellent', more a sad indictment of the Vietnam War
","Oliver Stone directed film about the interesting life of Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic.I say interesting, Kovic (excellently portrayed by Tom Cruise) becomes a confident, athletic, top of the PE class student to a crippled, wheelchair bound anti-war protester in a few years haunted by his own experiences in the U.S. war that became a noose around the country's neck, the Vietnam War.Director Stone seems to have cornered the Vietnam War film market, he is a veteran himself so deserves the accolade.Kovic becomes wounded, nearly dying in action for the Marines. Back home he along with other wounded in action troops are treat awfully in rehabilitation hospitals and a medic slips about cutbacks. The conditions are awful.
Kovic goes home to his bible bashing parents but soon spirals into a life of drink and paralised sexual experiences in Mexico.Still retaining some pride at his and his country's 'sacrifice' in action despite the growing anti-war resentment he faces by hippy protesters and alike.The last straw is being physically removed from the 1972 Republican 'Dick' Nixon convention. He is redeemed by being made a welcome addition to the '76 Democratic convention.The staunchly proud of his nation and its military intervention in the Vietnam War now being staunchly opposed to it.His own experiences through the film showing why his ideals may have changed so much.
At times harrowing, but nevertheless an engaging 145 minute or so experience.
Stone, like his earlier Vietnam War film, Platoon has brought an excellent film to the public.As a sidenote. The first Tom Cruise film I have seen in his career up to 1989 (I have yet to review Rain Man) that shows his acting abilities to the full. Also, a Spielberg like musical score from John Williams.",7,1,2,25 May 2019
Jurassic Park," Spielberg brings dinosaurs back to life!
","I've not visited this film for nigh on twenty years (is it that long) and what I came across was a film that took me back to the day I watched it on the cinema screen.The story based on Michael Crichton's novel is directed by great film director Steven Spielberg. It has elements that have proven a success in his near twenty year career prior to this 1993 release.The film is a technological achievement showing dinosaurs brought back to life on an island theme park.The casting includes stalwart Richard Attenborough as the island theme park owner John Hammond, Sam Neill as paleontologist Dr. Grant, Laura Dern as his partner paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).
The film was made so long ago now (1993) that Samuel L. Jackson has a mere supporting role!Of course the story is science fiction based on genetic engineering and it is the character of Malcolm that observes that 'life finds a way' in response to the genetic engineers assurances that the dinosaurs are all female and so cannot breed!At the time the dinosaurs are brought to the screen via a mixture of CGI and animatronic by renowned Stan Winston.The CGI does show a little of its age now?Mixing elements of disaster films, Jaws, King Kong to name but a few I was left thoroughly enthralled at the films grandeur that is lost a little on a television screen.The film has the usual Steven Spielberg company including music by John Williams but it is the dinosaurs that are the main attraction.",9,1,1,14 November 2019
The Wizard of Oz," Big budget doesn't always make a great film - 1939 example
","The film has several notable and well known musical melodies such as 'Over the Rainbow', 'Off to See The Wizard' to 'Ding Dong, the Witch is Dead'.The film has grown notoriety over the years by multiple television broadcasts especially over the Christmas holiday period.Featuring elaborate sets, costume, make-up. This film is the 1939 version of your latest cartoon adventures..but better. Excellent for younger viewers (and some older!).",7,0,1,27 June 2019
