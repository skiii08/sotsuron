The Incredible Hulk," The Hulk is Incredible
","THE INCREDIBLE BORE! I found myself yelling after watching the first Hulk movie. I was never a big Hulk comic book fan and after the first movie was such a snore fest, I really had no intentions of seeing this. Boy am I glad I didn't stick to those intentions. THIS MOVIE ROCKED! Ed Norton was a great surprise and William Hurt was a perfect fit for the role as the General. Tim Roth always plays a great villain and there is no exception here. The effects were great....the Hulk didn't look like a cartoon....and the action was fast and furious. Loved the park scene. Can not wait until the sequel and the Avengers movie.Although the movie is not quite as good as Ironman, it does make up for the lackluster adventures of a certain Mr. Jones.",9,2,4,5 July 2008
The Mist," Frank did it again
","I loved Shawshank....I loved the Greenmile.....both I thought were great in book and movie form. (Yes I know Shawshank was a short story.) I read the story of The Mist and thought it was a complete turd....as what I think many Stephen King books and Movies and short stories are with the exception of a few. Loved both Misery book and movie, Pet semetary book...not so much movie. OK...with that said, I just wanted you to know that I wasn't a bias King fan that praises everything that is turned from page to screen,(Come on Fanboys, Lawnmowerman? What the hell was that?) And I'm not a hater that flushes everything. I was reluctant to watch this movie, until my best friend forced me to go to the discount movie theater and watch it. Now...this movie is on my list to purchase when the DVD comes out. I loved the emotion of this movie and I will not be able to shake the ending for months. Congrates to Mr Darabonte for making another great movie and to Mr. King......Do not let ANYONE else direct movies based on your books other than MR FRANK DARABONT, or your likely to have another Lawnmower man on your hands.",Null,0,2,21 February 2008
The Departed," about time he met Oscar.
","I was outraged when Goodfellas was snubbed by Oscar. I truly thought in my heart that Marty would never make a film that was as good as Goodfellas. I was wrong. The Departed works on every level. Every actor in the film seems to be miles above their A game. Matt Damon continues to surprise me with his range of acting and Mark Walburg......WOW. Jack never disappoints and he does it again here, effortlessly. The only problem I had with the movie was the love triangle was very convincing, but not enough to weight the film down. For the first time in many years, after the name of the Best Picture and Best Director winner was read, I stood up and cheered.",10,1,7,13 April 2008
