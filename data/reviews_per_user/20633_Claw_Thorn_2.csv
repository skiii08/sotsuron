Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Character You can Love to Hate!
","Sacha Baron Cohen's well-developed character Borat Sagdiyev is definitely the type of character that would make you laugh, regardless of how evil you felt for doing so. A faithful and justified movie incarnation of the character most famously from Da Ali G Show, Borat's biased statements (reflecting the fictional portrayal of Kazakh culture), perverse behavior, and total bastardization of the English language make for a sense of humor that is palpable, yet still hard to digest.The film will probably shock and disgust you in several areas, yet it will most likely have you looking back at the horrible scenes with amusement, even as I write this, I can't help but giggle at the oafish behavior of Cohen's character as he goes about the United States skewering culture and beliefs, all the while testing the limits of others.Maybe I'm just a sucker for public nudity, maybe I'm just amused at Borat's ridiculousness, outrageous public displays, and overall awkward and gaudy appearance. Regardless of those things, I can;t help but want to see ore of this character, and I highly recommend the mockumentary to anybody with an open mind and an appreciation for improvisation.",10,1,15,19 May 2007
Grindhouse," Like a Roller Coaster Ride!
","When I first saw Grindhouse, it was for my 18th birthday party. They seemed to have no trouble at the local Edwards with letting me and my under-18 friends into the film, but that could have a lot to do with the fact that my friend Ian is quite big, causing him to appear older. We all went to see this film at first with the question on our minds of whether or not it would be good, I myself had mixed feelings before we went. However, within the first five minutes, the film captured us. First off, it introduces itself and appears in such a manner as a low budget shock film, the very difference however is intentional. The film was actually modified in order to appear low budget, with missing film reels, film skips, color filter issues, and a point where the film actually melts. The sheer cleverness of the film is enveloped and carefully portrayed through the quirks throughout. Grindhouse would be like a pie with a piece for everyone, 33% comedy, 33% horror, and 33% action/car chase. The TV adverts definitely did no justice for the film, as they didn't seem well enough to attract people to this 3 hour sitting. Couple that with the fact that the film contains graphic violence, strong language, and disturbing content to turn your stomach, and you've got a recipe for what turns out to be a marathon of badassery. Every sentence in the film is spoken with fulfilling character, and there are hundreds of witty comments and visual gags. The film feels both spoof and homage to the exploitation flicks of the 70's, and at the same time, it continues to push the boundaries of what's safe to show in theaters. I strongly encourage anybody with an appreciation for superb acting, a mindset for witty one-liners, and a stomach for gore to go and see this movie. You may even want to see it a second time to piece the two films in it together, and you'll definitely want to snatch it when it comes to DVD!",10,2,3,8 May 2007
