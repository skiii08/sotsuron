The Avengers," More Than Lives Up To The Hype. Exceptional In Every Way!
","As 10/10 as it gets!What makes Marvel great is that each of their Avenger solo studio films are packed with emotion and draws the audience in with relatable characters. The viewer cares about them and gets invested in to their story and character development. Now, magnify that times ten! Add way better action then we've seen from them in the past and you get the greatest genre work ever put to film with the Avengers. This movie more than lives up to the hype! I was on the edge of my seat several times during the film and I can't believe how fast over two hours flew by. Avengers is THE best comic adaptation film of all-time, period and end of story. That doesn't take away from past exceptionalism, even past Marvel films themselves but Avengers just delivers beyond what we've seen before from anyone. As good as Spider-Man 2 or TDK were, you really can't compare them because they operate on a smaller canvas and deliver far less notes. After seeing Avengers, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about if you're being honest with yourself and fair to the movie itself.",Null,4,10,28 April 2012
Source Code," nonsensical yet entertaining
","SPOILERS! The Source Codeâ€“ The plot and basis for the film are almost completely nonsensical yet, it's interesting and certainly a visual treat. It's an intriguing movie that may not exactly hold up well under scrutiny but it defines its own universe. It's almost as if the film itself knows things may not add up but doesn't care. It's going to tell this story and be entertaining regardless. What exactly is happening doesn't matter, it's the fact that it IS happening.SPOILER: Anyone else feel bad for Sean Fentress? He's either blown up in one reality or had his mind/soul pushed aside so that Gyllenhaal's Stevens can live happily ever after with the magnificent Michelle Monaghan. Thus, taking advantage of all the groundwork Sean put in to life. How's that relationship going to work? Gyllenhaal's Stevens didn't even know her last name an hour ago.",Null,7,11,5 April 2011
Iron Man 3," Best Movie Of 2013
","I don't know what the Oscar best picture allotment number is now-a-days but a film this good SHOULD be given serious consideration for the Best Picture Oscar. Yes, it's past time for a mere 'comic book movie' to be taken seriously. I know it's May but the Academy has to recognize this remarkable movie. If LOTR: Return of the King can win, so can this film. The action/fantasy bigotry from the Academy may be at an end.Honestly, Iron Man 3 is ten times a better all around film than something like District 9 or Life of Pi. When Roger Ebert called for Spider-Man 2 to be nominated for best picture no one listened. Well, times are a changing. Iron Man 3 is the kind of movie that delivers both quality and entertainment. Also, I wouldn't be surprised to see Robert Downey Jr. nominated again this time for Tony Stark. He deserved the honor back in 2008. Great performances by some of Oscar's old guard (RDJr, Gwenyth, Cheadle, Kingsley) plus an intelligent and thrilling movie with a mix of complex character strife equals gold in my book and most people's book. Hopefully, Oscar gold as well.",Null,0,1,10 May 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," One of the year's best films.
","It's not just that this movie is more filled with eye-popping effects and thrilling action sequences than the trilogy, though that's true. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. Wolverine starts fast, and springboards from the long-running Marvel Comics series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with the phrase 'summer movie.' For good reason, we equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action. (I'm sure Transformers 2 will give us plenty of that later in the summer.) But the writers here are as interested in the subtext as they are in the high quality action. There's no denying that mutant super-powers drive this film. This is what state-of-the-art special effects look like: the live-action version of the way comic books appear in your mind. That would be irrelevant, however, without a good story. The movie delivers enough story and skillfully weaves together character, plot and action. This movie and the action are just plain spectacular.One of the great things about this film is that virtually no screen time is spent on background character development. Like with last year's Incredible Hulk, the opening credits serve as a cool update and feeder for a basic origin. Even the newer characters that are introduced get very little time devoted to their past and it all works quite well. People in general are smart and can read between the lines, thus negating the necessity for cumbersome background information. Apparently the director figured this out and doesn't 'talk down' to his audience even though it's an action film. The pace flows smoothly, with hardly a stutter along the way to break up the story or the action. That's the key. As good as X2 was, Wolverine simply has better action without sacrificing the heart or character development or the emotion that made this franchise the juggernaut that it has turned out to be.This movie stands on its own, as its own Wolverine. People who've never seen any of the other movies can go and see it and enjoy it. I saw it with two people that have never seen any X-Men stuff and they loved it. One of the year's best.",Null,7,18,29 April 2009
Spider-Man 3," The Most Enjoyable Film of the Decade
","The good news is that this blockbuster is exceptional. It's easily the best of the trilogy and, for my money, the most enjoyable film of the decade.The comic-book-inspired franchise has always been about the search for balance; ironically, balance is was exactly what the first two movies lacked, with the seriously good cast continually upstaged by the special effects.This time round, thanks to an inventive script, all the elements are in sync. The plot gives New York photographer Peter Parker aka Spider-Man three foes to contend with - four, if you count his battle with himself, which is brought on by an alien landing and subsequently turns his suit jet-black.His love life is also a mess. He keeps trying, and failing, to propose to Mary Jane, who is suffering a career setback and does not appreciate the arrival of sweet blonde, Gwen Stacy.The villains are well-rounded, with Flint Marko a joy to behold. Actor Thomas Haden Church has a great, Depression era face and his transformation into The Sandman is spectacularly beautiful - the creature is like a Henry Moore sculpture.Meanwhile, Peter, Mary Jane and their rich friend Harry Osborn convince as fragile, ambitious twenty-somethings trying to make it in the big city. All the encounters are emotionally intense. They're also full of humor. 'Where do they get these guys?' says Spidey, tipping out sand from his boots.Spider-Man 3 is worth taking seriously, because it's so hell-bent on having fun and it won't be beat in the movie of the year race.-C.

Captain America: The First Avenger," Throw-Back Fun with Heart and Emotion
","This remarkable film showed that they really cared enough to ground this film where possible. That's what Marvel does so well. It's what Nolan does well and that's why people call what Nolan did to Batman 'Marvelizing' the character. The story and abilities are fantastic and grand but the character and depth add the weight you need to tell a believable yet intelligent tale. That's tough to do when the subject matter is this fantastic and the elements they deal with are so grandiose.The complexity, depth, heart, emotion and action are some of the best put together in any film this year. I have to agree with most of the film critics who are praising it and I'm glad it's getting the love at a high percentage. It would've been a shame for it not to be praised by the professionals. It really is professional, throw-back fun with heart and emotion.",Null,28,50,31 July 2011
Split," Terribly Overrated - it's sadistic, cruel and as entertaining as watching animals suffer
","SPOILERS...I found this movie to be shallow, unfocused and obviously uncomfortable as is its intention. M. Night Shyamalan's alleged return to glory isn't very glorious at all. It certainly is creepy but not in an entertaining way. When the last 30 seconds is the best part of the movie and it's only that way because it references a far better Shyamalan movie than the movie you just endured is a failure. Setting up a future shared Shyamalan universe is intriguing but it relegates this movie to nothing but an extended DVD extra setting up a supervillain for a better movie to come. Massive bonus points for McAvoy's performance. The split personality characters he embodies really are the only reason to endure this movie. It's acting class on a Masters level. Everything else is sadistic, cruel and as entertaining as watching animals suffer.",Null,58,141,10 February 2017
