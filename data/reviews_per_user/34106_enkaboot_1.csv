It," A good move. Worth the time and money
","Stephen King's stories are always mysterious and interesting and this is no exception. I assumed this to be another novel-movie blunder but turns out it is a great movie. The acting is great, the clown is scary (not too much) and there are some fun moments. What more do you need? There were, however, some awkward moments and the story could have been more versatile in some places but overall, I think it is great.",8,8,15,16 September 2017
