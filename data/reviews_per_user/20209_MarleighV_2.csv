Minority Report," Masterpiece
","Steven Spielberg has made one heck of a movie.  The visuals are stunning, a very contemporary sleek view of the future.  The storyline kept me interested from beginning to end (rare with long movies).  It was everything too.  It was suspenseful, scary, funny, heartwarming, sad and dramatic.  It was such a fascinating movie and the ride only gets more intense.  It is a very deep movie and some people may have trouble following it but if you don't think to much, you'll be all right because the master, Steven Spielberg, explains himself very well as he goes along.  This is a 10 out of 10.",Null,0,0,28 July 2002
Men in Black II," Good follow up
",My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It wasn't as action packed as the first one and since it's a sequel there were no real surprises but it was entertaining and very enjoyable.  I gave it a 7 out of 10 simply because it seemed just a little bit slower than I expected but it was still lots of fun and I'm going to see it again.,7,0,0,5 July 2002
