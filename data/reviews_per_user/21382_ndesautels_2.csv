Skyfall," One of the Worst Bonds Ever!
","Being a huge Bond fan, particularly the last two films, and reading the never ending good reviews I was expecting something epic.Maybe this high bench mark has somewhat biased my opinion but instead of the best bond film ever, I found Skyfall to be one of the worst.Basically it's boring, there's nothing new, and seems to be a swan song for Bond rather than a celebration of all that makes it great!It starts out good, then suddenly becomes the slowest paced Bond film, and nothing but a rehash of old story lines. Once again an old MI6 agent has gone rogue. Once again someone has a personal vendetta against M and wants to kill her for a judgment call she made in the past.One good thing about the film is, besides a stop in China for a stylish Kill Bill style assassination, it takes place in the UK.Javier Bardem is the best thing in the film but I think he's on screen maybe 15 minutes.It starts out being about a missing list of agents, a la Mission Impossible, but the plot loses it's way and becomes an very overly complicated revenge plan to kill M and equally overly complicated and stupid plan to evade it. I think what disappointed me the most was the constant references to how old and useless Bond has become. He's off work for 3 months and comes back suddenly as a 70 year old that can't shoot. MI6 is constantly said to be old and unneeded, isn't this in the same world with constant media hysteria about the threat of terrorists and need to more and more national security? Isn't there two more Daniel Craig Bond films after this, as it seemed like a curtain call film more than anything else.The baddie we are told is a psycho, extremely dangerous and most importantly a master with technology. But Technology is hardly used at all and not really featured. There was a lot more in the last film or the ones with Pierce Brosnan.Finally the big twist (don't worry I won't reveal it) is really obvious. Also all the reviews seem to mention there is a twist (I know I just did, but if your reading these reviews, I'm thinking your the type of person who reads the professional ones, and already knows).",7,23,51,1 November 2012
Bridesmaids," Lacklustre mildly amusing comedy
","I really don't know why people liked this so much. When I saw the preview it didn't look that great but after all the hype and good reviews I figured I better give it a chance. I loved the Hangover and since I keep hearing that this film was the female version I was expecting some great adult humour.This film is nothing like the Hangover! Just adding some jokes about shitting yourself does not make it a edgy. The lead character is extremely unlikable, and though she acts like a complete dick throughout the film towards her friend and love interest she never apologies and for some reason they end up apologizing to her. The pacing was terrible, the film was way too long. The jokes were few and far between. The characters were very undeveloped and soulless. The whole thing was pretty pointless. I wouldn't recommend it.",6,0,2,19 November 2011
