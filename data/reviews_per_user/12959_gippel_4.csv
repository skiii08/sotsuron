Mission: Impossible III," Without a BOOM
","Mission Impossible 3, in short, is different. It feels more like a drama then a big budget blockbuster. JJ.Abrams directional debut plays out like a very long TV episode of alias. The action, although expensive, feels pretty flat. This is what you get if you slipped Micheal Bay some relaxation pills. The camera is shaky and up close, I actually prefer John Woo's stylized choreography oppose to this. Although I didn't expect much of a plot, I certainly didn't expect so much emotion. I don't care about Ethan Hunt, I want to see him in break in buildings rather then making the transition to a family guy. Aside from a cool break into the Vatican, there is not much to see here.",5,1,2,17 May 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Very long and flawed.
","I haven't read the books, and my only relationship with Narnia is from the old BBC series. And upon viewing the movie, I had fair expectations for it. Sadly, Naria comes as a disappointment. First off, Naria is long. It drags in many places, and IMO it could easily be edited down half a hour or so without loosing any value. I'm not usually for trimming down the running time in favor for action and pace. But here I thought the running time ruined the experience for me. Secondly, the cast. I didn't care much for the four siblings. OK, Lucy was adoring, but that was about it. Aside from poor performances, I was never convinced that the fate of Narnia rested upon two skimpy boys and their sisters. Perhaps I'm missing the point, but the movie never gave me a good explanation of it either. It just seems hollow, like it cues up events from the books without proper care or meaning. And story aside, the movie is not that much of an excitement. Its visual, even with its impressive cgi characters and make up is too saturated and bright for my taste. Overall Narnia comes as an disappointment, with its running time as its biggest flaw",5,0,0,1 May 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," A rare piece of cinema
","A good way to start the this years cinema season, Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful fairy tales for adults. Its rare case, an adult oriented fairy tale, and thankfully, it doesn't implode on itself either. Being a Guillermo del Toro directed movie, I though I walking into a stylish and violent fantasy. Instead, its a much more subtle affair, and it strikes a good balance between the various elements. Its visuals are like a reminiscence of the movie itself, mystical and intriguing. Its well executed, in all departments. And I have to point out the outstanding music. In general, Pan's Labyrint feels like something new. When walking out of the cinema, I got sensation that I just witnessed something quite unique, and thats not very often.",9,1,3,5 January 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Interesting concept, poorly executed.
","There is no denying the hype of 'The Da Vinci Code'. I recently read the novel prior to the theatrical release of the movie. And in my opinion, I found the book interesting because of the many theories and facts it presented, not the fictional story that surrounds it. The movie on the other hand, seems to favor the fictional story. I have to say that I am a bit disappointed of Ron Howard. It would seem that after his recent masterpieces that this would be a safe bet. You know, like an epic adaption, code breaking in the sense of John Nash in 'A Beautiful Mind'. Sadly, Howard moves through the material with hasty pace, and without much tension. In general, I guess you could say that the movie is quite faithful to the book. Some things are changed though, but nothing major. However, the movie seems to be taking a much safer and milder tone to its accusations. Visually, the movie looks OK. I had hope a for a little bit more from the cinematography, but it was OK. The same can be said from Hans Zimmers score, it does its job, but nothing memorable.To conclude, in my opinion the movie seems to lay its wight on other elements then what I found interesting in the book. Its source material was interesting, the movie on the other hand, passes as a decent thriller. Just barley though.",6,2,5,20 May 2006
