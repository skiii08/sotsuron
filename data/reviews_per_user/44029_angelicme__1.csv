Howl's Moving Castle," Magical Miyazaki Strikes Again!
","Once again, Miyazaki has unleashed another great movie into the world. I was so lucky to see it at Venice Film Festival with my cousin and mum. That's one Italian holiday I'll never forget!Watching this movie was something I've wanted to do in ages, I've followed its progress and waited just like others to see it come out. It was worth the wait, it's great!It starts off like the book, a plain (yet in my opinion, quite pretty) eighteen year old girl, working as a hatter in the family shop. As the oldest, Sophie tells herself that she will live a very boring life. One day, there is news that a scary castle has started floating around the hills of Sophie's hometown. It's said to belong to 'Evil Wizard Howl', who is said to eat the hearts of young girls. Sophie, not thinking herself as much doesn't worry, as she's sure '...he only eats the hearts of pretty girls'.One night, after being saved from trouble by a handsome man who said he'll be back to see her... A witch, who had seen what had happened comes to visit and puts a curse onto Sophie turning her into an old woman.I won't say anymore from fear of giving out massive spoilers... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE! When it gets near to you... WATCH IT! YOU HAVE TO! IT'S GREAT! BETTER THEN SPIRITED AWAY! (And we all thought that wasn't possible) BUT IT'S Truly THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING EVER! 10/10 AND ****** SIX STARS (not 5) SIX!",10,9,18,9 September 2004
