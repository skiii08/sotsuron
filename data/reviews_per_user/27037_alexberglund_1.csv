First Man," You will never look at the moon the same way again
","This movie almost made me cry. It made all the apollo missions seem so personal. Before I saw this movie, it was hard to imagine the enormous risks these astronauts took and the sacrifices they made. 
Moreover, the visuals were stunning. I've never felt so close to space before. Linus Sandberg can expect another Oscar. The combination of that and Justin Hurwitz breathtaking music, made this movie a true masterpiece.",10,10,26,14 October 2018
