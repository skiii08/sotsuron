Blade Runner 2049," Hated it
","I was so looking forward to this film. But the storyline is weak. Gosling is awful. Harrison Ford texts it in. Even the special effects lack solidity. It's like watching a series of cutscenes from a video game cobbled together.The objectification of women is off the scale. Maybe the makers thought this film would only be watched by heterosexual males, but come on! It got to the point where I wanted to put a brick through the screen.There's none of the depth and pathos of Ridley Scott's original. Hugely disappointing.",1,8,18,3 March 2018
Interstellar," Daddy's in the bookcase!
","I like the film, but the whole 'Daddy's in the bookcase!' bit at the end just makes me wanna smash the screen every time.",8,0,1,6 March 2020
1917," A technical achievement, but a glamorisation of WWI
","You have to admire the technical achievement and the art direction. It really looks like the actors are moving through endless trenches and battlefields. Some of it must have been CGI-ed, though you can't tell what. You soon forget you're watching 'one shot'. Of course it isn't one shot. It's just made to look like it.What lets the film down is an implausible, paper-thin storyline (the upper echelons of the British military were inept, but even they wouldn't have sent only two soldiers to relay a vital message calling off a doomed advance) that unavoidably glamorises WWI. It's as if the film-makers were still in James Bond fantasy land, and were primarily concerned with one question: what's exciting? Ooh, I know! A bunker collapsing! A plane crashing right on to the main characters! A chase through a ruined town spookily lit by swinging flares! A fall into a raging river! A ridiculous run along the front line just as the soldiers are going over the top, making such a thing more difficult to negotiate than the trenches themselves. Realistic this film is not. At least with a movie like Saving Private Ryan the action sequences were in service of an interesting plot that had some basis in fact. Here they're just shoved in for no good reason.To me, it's a shame. There must be a million actual, real-life WWI stories that haven't been told on film. Why didn't Sam Mendes tell one of them instead of going for this fiction?",6,3,8,27 January 2020
Midsommar," Middling Midsommar
","As a fan of the director's previous feature film, Hereditary, I perhaps expected too much. Basically, the film is too long, too pretentious and too predictable. Before I saw the film I guessed the visiting students would be used by the commune either as human sacrifices or for reproduction, to add to the commune's gene pool. In fact, both of these things happen, with the boyfriend of the main character - in what amounts to a rape scene - being drugged into sex, and everyone else except the main character being killed and burnt in a ceremonial sacrifice.But the film takes too long to get there. I found my attention wandering quite a few times. What's great about Ari Aster is that he knows horror films made today need to concentrate on atmosphere, and creating striking, disturbing visuals that stay with you. All horror tropes have been done to death by now, so you have to go this way, though it's something plenty of directors don't seem to know. I'm all for slowing things down and not turning a movie into a trashy slasher film, but there's a limit. The foreboding atmosphere in Midsommar isn't strong enough, and the disturbing visuals get lost amid so much padding.Midsommar isn't a bad film - I get the feeling Aster doesn't have a bad film in him - but it's not overly special. It's just middling.",5,5,8,28 September 2019
It Chapter Two," I've seen episodes of Sesame Street that are scarier
","The start of this film is okay, but it descends into farce. It becomes such a CGI-ed, laughable mess I had to switch it off before the end.The best thing about it is Stephen King playing the role of a shopkeeper opposite James McAvoy. It's more than a cameo; the role is quite lengthy for a non-actor. Sadly, it serves as a reminder of how King's novel is much more bearable than this turkey of a movie.IT ends? Thank God for that.",2,3,5,23 November 2019
Wonder Woman," Execrable script
","I think Gal Gadot is excellent. My score is basically for her. But the script is terrible. It got to the point where Wonder Woman is charging across no man's land, machine gun bullets bouncing off her bracelets, and I could bear it no longer. Why bring the First World War into it? That wasn't a time of superheroes, to be made light of. It was a time of young men sinking into mud, their bodies torn apart, dying horribly.I wanted to love this film, especially since I loved the TV series with Lynda Carter, but the script killed it for me.",3,3,7,17 August 2019
Mother!," Simply dreadful!
",Who needs yet another retelling of the Bible story? I've read the director did it to highlight environmentalism and the destruction of the earth. Wrong target audience! The devout believe God will always save them. They believe in eternal souls and the afterlife. Religion is one of the principal reasons why we're marching towards extinction.Pretentious. Painful. Indulgent. The only good thing about it is Jennifer Lawrence's performance. She is totally committed to the role and keeps you watching. I just wish I'd known it was such a waste of time from the start.,1,4,8,26 February 2018
Annihilation," Common sense annihilated
","I read somewhere that this is one of those rare sci-fi films where the characters don't make stupid mistakes, and act in accordance with common sense. If only. Never mind using flimsy paddling boats after you've just been attacked by a giant mutant alligator. Never mind using night-vision goggles to see that a perimeter fence has just been opened up by something 'like a zipper', and then promptly putting the goggles down and saying, 'I can't see anything.' Never mind cutting a man's whole stomach off just to show a camera that his insides are moving. Those are just a few of the better decisions the characters make.The film has other problems. I haven't read the books, and the first 15 minutes were a mess to me. Just awful. I didn't know what was going on, but I wasn't intrigued in the slightest. It's not until the 'Shimmer' is introduced that you feel any interest at all. Portman's performance is lacklustre. Whoever thought of putting instrumental guitar music in the soundtrack deserves a slap. Lena's affair seemed to be stuck in there for no good reason. Her duel at the end with her 'echo' goes on for way too long.Then there's the worst thing: the ending. I would have settled for being offered a choice of possible reasons for the Shimmer, and then being left to decide for myself which one was true. Instead, we get only one explanation: aliens did it. Why? No one knows. It's a bit of a cop-out.",5,1,4,16 March 2018
