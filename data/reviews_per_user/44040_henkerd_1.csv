Changeling," Great film, but a little slow
","This movie was brilliant although i did find it slow to get started, once i got into it i couldn't tear myself away. It is very rare for me to watch a movie without a break, but once i got into it i couldn't turn it off. It has so many twists and turns throughout it's one of those movies that stand out and you have to watch till the end. A MUST SEE FILM. Angelina was great as were all of the other actors. A well written film based on a a true story. I loved this film and i believe it will be a classic. My only criticism is that i wasn't expecting some of the violent scenes with children in and it did make me feel a little sick, so it's not for the weak hearted.",8,0,0,26 July 2012
