Sucker Punch," The theatrical version with multiple cuts is what most of these reviews are aimed at
","Watch the extended version, do not watch the theatrical version, I repeat the extended version is 1000% better and it makes sense and it has two well known actors in it that were cut from the theatrical version! But be warned it's darker, but only because we get answers....... The rest of this review must be non-filler. Why is it required that I type this much, who knows? This movie, with a proper ending, can be compared with Fight club, if that doesn't convince you maybe my personal testimony will, I almost never write reviews on here, I've only written one other review other than this one. Watch the extended cut! If anything watch it to see more of the high roller, played by John Hamm and to understand the ending.",9,7,12,17 April 2016
