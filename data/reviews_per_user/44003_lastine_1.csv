As the movie continues lessons of triumph and sacrifice prevail over the despair of war and love and hope take home the prize.Acting The humor makes it enjoyable to watch Emotions are obvious Tons of music to add tension Good realistic costuming and makeup The actors dumped in realistic feeling to make the movie tense and fun to watch.Message; This movie is full of hope and leaves you feeling triumphant, prideful and courageous. It proves how people have to hold on to whatever you have left and treasure your history because when that is taken from you, you have no identity left and can be lost and left behind, forgotten in history.Critic; In the beginning of the movie, it was unclear who was who and what was going on, but this ended up being of benefit to the plot because it added suspense and tension.",9,0,3,26 April 2016
