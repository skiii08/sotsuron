Changeling," A heavy movie
","This movie is very different than I expected. There is no spooky sci-fi changes in the child. It is not at all about a woman's doubt if her son is truly her son. It is not about a woman coming to accept an alternate child offered to her in place of her lost son.The plot meanders in off in ways you cannot predict with Hollywood formulas because it is based on reality. It is harrowing. You have to stop the DVD every once in a while to take a breath. The movie goes on an on, even after each time you think it is done, with yet another twist.It is a movie about some very nasty, powerful people, and how a rather ineffectual, stupid woman manages to stand up to them.",9,2,4,20 October 2009
The New World," heart breaking
","I was worried that The New World would be a Disnified tale. It was not. It was something quite unlike anything I had seen before. It tells its story mostly visually, with some natural sounds and with a soaring soundtrack in the classical style.It does not explain. It leaves everything you see just as mysterious as it was for the colonists.Though there are terrible battles, it is not one of those stupid shoot-em-ups where you are supposed to presume all virtue lies with one side and all wickedness the other.The ghastliness of living in a fledgling colony is nightmarish. Not only do you deal with contaminated food, starvation, freezing, lack of water, you deal with religious and superstitious lunatics, racists, despotic power crazed loons, torture and people with gold fever who can't think of anything else.Q'orianka Kilcher who plays Pocahontas looks much like Olivia Hussey who played Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet. She has captivating body language, but does not look like a 'natural', what the English colonists call the aboriginal people.There is not that much humour. The one scene that made me laugh was a native exploring an English formal garden and being utterly baffled by the symmetrical shapes of the topiary.There is a lot of heartache in this movie, balanced by the joy of an untrammelled natural world. It was a bit too intense for me.",9,0,1,21 August 2012
Catch Me If You Can," acting within acting
","This works for much the same reason Shakespeare works with women characters dressing as boys in the play where the original actor is a boy playing a woman. Di Caprio plays a con man who is a consummate actor. Since his skill at conning is identical to di Caprio's acting skill in the movie, his schemes blend seamlessly. His ability to fool people seems completely natural.The plot whips along at a galloping pace.Actors like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro seem wasted in this movie. Hanks plays a very bland uninteresting cop. The role could have been played by any balding TV cop.This is based on a true character. Truth is stranger than fiction, especially some of his escapes.",7,0,2,31 October 2006
Minority Report," If you Liked Blade Runner...
","I long ignored this movie because of the title. 'The Minority Report' sounded as exciting as a documentary on the decline of General Motors from an accountant's point of view.This a brilliant movie. It is a tour de force of the imagination. It reminded me of Blade Runner -- a gritty, thoughtful, believable vision of the future, casually laid out in great detail in much the way a drama about the old west would be handled. It is not just a few gimmicks. It creates a complete world, complete with shopping malls, advertising, office buildings, gardens, airports, cars, elevators...The scene when Cruise gets new eyes is pure little-boy Spielberg, grossing out his younger sister with an unlimited budget. I bet you can't watch it without gasping and going 'Eeww'.Max von Sydow is a treat. Colin Farrell gives you the creeps, though you can't figure out why.It borrows from Fellini's Satyricon, with the pale, frail oracles who float in a pool of water.It is an amazing movie in that it has no filler. Every scene has you glued.It works on many levels. It is a complicated whodunnit. It explores philosophy. It is a commentary on some of the less wholesome directions are society is going.You won't want to miss a minute, or even stop the DVD. Make sure you have plenty to drink before you start.",10,1,2,27 June 2009
Gravity," special effects / disaster movie
","I expected the movie to be about the psychological tensions of being a female captain in a traditionally male-dominated world. Nope that was not it at all. Sandra Bullock is the only character alive for most of the movie. She has to carry the entire movie. It is a special effects/disaster flick. She moves from one space station to another, escaping by the skin of her teeth, as they are blown to bits by space debris.The special effects are quite believable. I don't know how they were done. People and objects float rotating serenely. There are no crude wires to get in the way of the action.The space stations are incredibly cramped. I can imagine the locker room smell. They look completely plausible. I had waves of claustrophobia just looking an them on the TV screen.The movie ended too soon. I was far from convinced she was home free. I wanted to see something of what happened to her character, Ryan Stone, after she made it back to earth.Some things did not make sense. What was this somewhat clueless woman doing on a space station? Why could she walk immediately after months in space? Why is there so much noise in space especially when dialogue makes the point there isn't? Why is there no way to make radio contact with earth from any of the space stations?For me it was too repetitive. Too much action and not enough psychology. It is a boy flick masquerading as a chick flick.",7,1,2,14 June 2014
Star Trek," Great Job
","I think they did a bang up job. All my favourite characters were there, played by younger actors. I very quickly accepted the new actors. They caught the essence. I choked up every time Leonard Nimoy came on screen playing the future Spock. The characters are in constant danger. I kept thinking they were done for, only perhaps to be rescued by some sort time travel paradox. But each time they concocted some crazy improbable way to rescue themselves. Very imaginative escapes.Things I did not like: Romulans were much more like Klingons than Romulans. You can't change something that basic without explanation. Someone called out 'Godspeed'. All the other Star Trek adventures are relentlessly secular. There was too much boring watching spaceships shoot fireworks at each other or people shooting laser pistols at each other.I burst out laughing at the Romulan spaceship like a giant hairy cockroach, another like a 1920s eggbeater. The drill for some bizarre reason was covered in giant thorns. None of this seemed plausible to me.Chris Pine was meltingly handsome and charming. In future I hope he gets more kisses planted on those perfect lips of his.",9,1,2,31 August 2016
Monster," Acting Tour de Force
","When I was watching this movie I asked myself how on earth someone as coarse, and raw looking as the Aileen character could ever have become a movie actress. When I saw in the credits it was the glamorous Charlize Theron from Cider House Rules I just about fell out of my chair.She plays an obnoxious whore, drunken, loutish, belligerent, crazy.Yet you stay sympathetic even as she becomes deranged and murders. She is completely believable with the pulled down sneer, the accent and the body language. Even the drinking scenes were completely believable.It could be described as a bleak version of Thelma and Louise. It is grim and makes the point, life is not fair, nowhere near.",8,0,0,14 April 2006
The Hunger Games," a big metaphor
","This is a distressing movie to watch. 24 handsome randomly picked teenage couples are forced to fight to the death until only one survives in a state sponsored spectacle. Only one of the 24 actually relishes killing off the others. The rest do it just to save their skins.The society that arranges this is technologically advanced, decadent, highly artificial, somewhat reminiscent of the foppishness of the court of King Louis VI. This is indicated with impractical clothing, overly elaborate shellacked hair styles and extreme makeup with strange colours.I kept wondering if the players would subvert the game, and refuse to play. But they were just randomly chosen teenagers, not heroic societal architects, who after a bit of flirtation with rebellion, did just what their handlers asked of them. Quite a downer ending.The movie can be taken as a metaphor for war, where people who have no grudge against each other are conscripted to kill each other.The movie can also be taken as a metaphor for show business, with the cut-throat competition, the sponsors and the way everything is faked, and the way those in control use people as toys to provide entertainment, and their complete lack of compassion, honesty and fair play.",8,0,4,15 October 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," not a real Star Trek Movie
","This is the most disappointing Star Trek film I have seen.The first problem is it is a prequel with all new actors, none of whom look like or sound like or even act like the originals. The ship is inexplicably now ten times larger and more complex. The warp drive and transporter technology are different than they should be. The bridge looks like it were designed by Klaus Lagerfeld, completely unrecognisable as the Spartan original. It takes getting used to the new characters and completely different sets. Someone seeing is as their first Star Trek movie would not have these difficulties.The next problem is this not really a Star Trek film. In a normal Star Trek film, you encounter some alien civilisation with odd customs and get to explore the ramifications of that difference. Instead, this film is about warring egos with fist fights and gun fights to settle the matter. Boring!There is no subtlety, other than trying to figure out whom it is safe to trust. You spend an extreme percentage of the film watching CGI of things blowing up. Boring!There is just the briefest, but intriguing scene where Captain Kirk seduces two ladies who have slithering tiger tails.Star Trek is not known for its plausibility. There is a lovely bit of dialogue poking fun at that characteristic when Kirk gets a dressing down. However, it strained my credulity past the breaking point when they would show the ship with huge gaping holes blasted into it, then show inside shots of people screaming 'we lost all power', then showing everyone running about with full lighting having no problems breathing.An annoying goof: Everyone screams 'the gravity system has failed'. Instead of floating about, everyone starts either sliding or falling.People do various leaps that would be implausible even in a video game.The villains Khan and Marcus keep us guessing what their motives are and whether they are telling the truth. This is pretty sophisticated stuff for the movies.Kirk goes into the core of a reactor and kicks it to get it going, almost killing himself with radiation in the process. This is just too stupid for words.Did I say that most of the film is just a series of explosions and ray gun fights? boring boring boring.",5,3,5,28 October 2014
Billy Elliot," live with a homophobic father
","Billy Elliot is about a fairly ordinary boy, his authoritarian homophobic father, a loutish brother, and a down at the heels dance instructor. I expected Billy to be effeminate, maybe even camp. However, he is a played by an ordinary sassy 11-year old who likes to move, to dance, and to do ballet.It is heartbreaking watching the poor kid trying deal with his adamant father.The father comes around almost instantly on seeing Billy dance. This left me reeling.The movie leaves out all of Billy's formal education and early professional career.By the end Dad is proud of his son, even if he dances, dances ballet, is gay and belongs to a travesty ballet company. This just seems a little too 'happy ever after' at the cost of realism.",7,0,3,4 November 2016
Finding Nemo," morality tale
","I am interested mostly of the effect of this movie on young kids, not on the adults dragged along.Most of animations are terrifying -- being stuck in the mouth of a whale, being surrounded by flocks of seagulls, being caught in a net. Animation's ability to exaggerate makes these events shocking. I remember being five watching Snow White terrified out of my mind hiding under my seat. Perhaps today's kids are more jaded.The movie sees human activity through fish eyes, and the mindless destructiveness of human activity. Just as Bambi put children off hunting in my generation, Finding Nemo should work against commercial fishing for this one.Nemo and his father are repeatedly caught in totally hopeless situations, but the both refuse to surrender and by the skin of their teeth prevail. This is great conditioning for kids. Dory's ditzy lack of understanding of the danger takes a little of the edge off the terror, even though logically she is adding to the predicament.I laughed when it turned out the arch villain of the show was a little girl who liked to buy pet fish then not care for them.As an adult, the schmaltzy opening between Marlon and Coral was just so anthropomorphic it put me off. I would have preferred a slightly more realistic representation of fish 'thoughts'. The characters were just too crass to be clown fish. It just did not fit.That's an odd criticism coming from someone who found a Meercat in the Lion King doing the hula was the funniest thing I ever saw.One final comment. Albert Brooks as Nemo's father sometimes appeared to be channeling the late Sterling Holloway.",8,0,2,23 June 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," Exciting Special Effects Movie
","I watched this film twice. If you want complex character development, this is not your film. This is about dazzling special effects, and lots of scary stunts, with people doing foolish and dangerous things.The disaster is on a GRAND scale, the entire northern hemisphere becoming uninhabitable by being suddenly covered in a new ice age. The surviving population of the USA become refugees in third world nations throughout the world. The president apologizes for his foolish short sighted anti-environmental policies that lead this catastrophe. This is not some petty disaster of a town being invaded by killer bees.The magical ability of the leads to survive in temperatures that freeze everyone else solid in seconds is never explained. However, I am good at suspension of disbelief, and the film kept me on the edge of my seat.Watching the New York skyscrapers turn into Popsicles is awe-inspiring and beautiful. Nature is like an avenging fury, majestic and beautiful. It is thus oddly deeply satisfying watching the massive tidal wave swamp New York.The science to justify all the mayhem is not ridiculously hokey as is usual in such flicks. At least the vocabulary rings true.",7,0,1,27 July 2006
Spider-Man 3," Spotty
","This movie it like a collection of short stories stitched together with the flimsiest glue. There is brilliance. The animation of the birth of the sand creature is perhaps the best realistic animation I have ever seen on screen. It was sheer poetry, movie magic at its best.I really enjoyed swinging along with Peter between buildings in the first Spider Man movie. I did not get that enjoyment this time. The action was speeded up so much I felt an outsider watching machines zip about hyped up on some alien drug. It was all too fast to follow and too exaggerated to accept as real. I was no longer a participant, merely an observer.I am gay and this movie offers up acres of male eye candy. Topher Grace (aka Eric Forman) drops his nerd persona and plays an irresistibly sexy, evil character. James Franco looks like some 50s pop idol with a smile that could melt steel. Thomas Hayden Church is massive, hard and terrifying in his intensity.It is a metaphoric morality tale where evil, drugs, power are represented by a black, enveloping, alien life force. These black strands bestow power, euphoria and magnify character defects, just like drugs or war. I took the movie as a metaphor for the way the USA has become corrupted and needs to return to its old red-white-and-blue morality, not stooping to selfishness, sadism, gluttony and greed.There are four villains Spidy has to contend with, often ganging up on him. The movie dragged a bit for me. However, some of the scenes with the sand creature were so entrancing the rest of the movie was irrelevant. Later on in the movie, the animation was dreadful -- reminiscent of an old Godzilla movie. It was like seeing an old Vermeer painting touched up by Ronald McDonald.",7,0,0,1 July 2007
Crash," like watching a skydiving team
","The movie opens with a cast of such obnoxious, self-centred, rude, racist, sexist, irritating characters that we almost turned the movie off.It is a bit like watching a sky diving team gradually link up to form a giant web in the sky. There is an enormous cast of sharply drawn characters who start out having nothing to do with each other, but by a series of co-incidences, accidents and malice gradually form a completely interconnected web of relationships.The movie evolves in a way that grabs your heartstrings and won't let go, in a very non-Disney way. Many of the people you want to have a horrible death in the early part of the movie are redeemed or partly redeemed later on.The problem with such a huge cast, there is hardly any time for each of the stars, especially Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser.There is one intricately crafted plot line that suddenly twists and leaves you gasping, and in tears for ten minutes. I hope nobody gives it away. That will be the moment of the movie you remember 20 years from now.Because there are so many characters, and because you only gradually discover the relationships, just what is happening is not always obvious.",8,1,3,11 May 2012
Spider-Man: Homecoming," mixed
","What I liked: Tom Holland is a charmer, much better looking than in still pictures. He alternates between timid everyman and smartass hero. He reminds me a bit of Marty McFly in Back to the Future. Michael Keaton was one of the best villains I have ever seen in movies. It was so fun to see Robert Downey Jr, but not nearly enough screen time. Liz is an easily believable heartthrob. She has athletic beauty and substance. What I did not like: two of the sidekicks were grossly obese. The actors talk so fast in teen slang I could only understand a small fraction of the dialogue. Most of the movie consists of unidentified out-of-focus objects being thrown at the 3D audience. That gets annoying very quickly. I kept checking my watch to see how much longer it would go on. Special effects are non-stop. It really does seem as though Spiderman has superhuman strength and agility. The effects are quite natural.",7,5,13,16 November 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Best movie ever made
","This is an absolutely brilliant movie. It may well be the best movie ever made. I first saw it in 1964. Dozens of its vivid scenes stuck with me over years. I saw it again just now in 2013. It was even better than I remembered it. It tackles the ultimate serious subject with perfect deadpan humour.The first time I saw it, I was tied up in the plot, and my frustration with all these idiots refusing to behave sensibly to save their skins. The second time I focused more on the human foibles it poked fun of, people reflexively concerning themselves with looking good, or seeking a petty advantage, even if the face of nuclear war. I carefully watched every gesture and eyebrow twitch, all as controlled as a renaissance painting.The first time, the scene that haunted me most was Colonel Bat Guano refusing to shoot a coke machine. The second time it was Mandrake trying to humour the out-of-his gourd Brigadier General Jack Ripper, and Dr. Strangelove selling his plan to live in mineshafts.The plot is brilliant. Everything crazy thing that happens comes with an airtight, plausible explanation. The technical mumbo jumbo and the 'advanced' 1950s technology stands up very well. I was only jarred once by an erroneous explanation of half-life.This time I noticed a young James Earl Jones playing Lothar Zogg, one of the bomber crew. I did not notice him the first time because he had not yet become famous.The first time a saw it I remember thinking Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson (George C. Scott) and Major 'King' Kong (Slim Pickens) were quite elderly. This time they looked dewy-faced and even sexy.",10,6,10,1 May 2013
Pan's Labyrinth," unique
","I was expecting a Felliniesque romp. It was not. This movie is completely different. It is about war, cruelty and brutality, delicately merged with the weird and supernatural. It flits back and forth, gradually merging the two more deeply so you can't tell them apart.I thought it might be a Euro Charles Bronson revenge flick because the villains were so villainous. It made me hate the military and war with a white hot passion. I was wrong every time I tried to predict the plot with the usual movie formulas. I had to walk away several times during the movie because I could not handle the cruelty. It depicts pain in ways very easy to relate to, and very hard to watch dispassionately.The movie is in Spanish, a rich, rolling Spanish that exudes passion. It has an almost operatic feel to it. Much of the movie is filmed in the dark with fires and candlelight.The film early on sets the stage that everyone is at risk. So the threats to the young heroine are terrifying and completely believable. The suspense is real.The actor who plays the faun is riveting. You can't take your eyes off him and your ears hang on his every syllable. He is both kindly and terrifying at the same time.The special effects are unusually good, especially the way stick insects gradually become fairies and back. The way they do it is much like the way you can see figures in the embers of a fire. At first you wonder if your OWN imagination is playing tricks on you.The ending was very different than the orgy of special effects I expected, but on reflection, it reflected perfect cosmic justice.",9,1,5,11 February 2009
Lost in Translation," Bored and Boring
","If you like Pina Colada,and other alcoholic drinks,If you leave long pauses,Cause it gives you time to think,If you like bad Karaoke,from collagenous lips,You will love Japan,where you never have to tip.The basic plot is similar to Woody Allen's Manhattan. A beautiful young girl (married this time) has an affair with a much older man, primarily out of boredom, and because his gentle jokes help pass the time.The movie start by discombobulating you by showing how madly different Japan is from America. The movie looks full of comic promise.The movie slows to a snail's pace, and nothing happens. At least a lot less of interest happens than on my own explorations of foreign cities. The film feels sloppily and lazily ad-libbed.The running joke is Japanese people persist in speaking Japanese, because they can't think of anything else to try to communicate with Americans. What is the matter with them? Why don't they speak the English?The biggest mystery of the film is how did it come to be that a young married middle class couple are living in a luxury Japanese hotel next to faded 70's action star there filming a Japanese whiskey commercial.The movie projects a mild racism, sneering at the Japanese, not as different, but as inferior. There is no affection or sympathy for them. They are often portrayed as robots or buffoons.Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte was a good casting choice. She is extremely beautiful, without being flashy or glamorous. She has a unique wholesome look. She confused me only once when she donned a short pink wig, and I did not recognise her. I usually have a lot of trouble telling female actresses apart.Bill Murray plays Bob Harris a faded, restrained, sad, hen-pecked, defeated character similar to Don Johnston in Broken Flowers, his earlier much more emotional and engaging film.The moral of the story is, if you are bored, money will not help.",6,2,3,12 December 2014
Empire of the Sun," heartfelt movie
","Here is a movie where you really care about the lead character and all the horrible things that happen to him. I walked about in a daze for a few days after seeing the movie thinking of nothing else but that children should never have to endure what Jim endured.Jim himself is a heroic character, who consistently makes the best of a bad situation. His acting is superb, absolutely believable.The movie is a bit like Catch-22 in the way war seems just so blinking insane.Basie is an unusual movie character, both hero and villain. Malkovich does an excellent job projecting his complex character.",9,0,2,10 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A visual, imaginative feast
","This movie is a treat for the eyes. There are all manner of imaginative aliens and alien animals, who not only look strange, but move and act in strange ways.I found even Jar Jar Binks amusingly novel. The two male leads are unusually handsome. As we move from planet to planet we are treated to completely different stunning landscapes. The architecture is mind- bending as well.There all kinds of different transportation devices, for ground, air and space. The screen is so rich, you only have time to take a fraction of the feast in.In the first half of the movie, there are a few of those boring CGI fights between spacecraft, but most of the action is much more imaginative usually involving falling from great heights.There are a few anomalies that bothered me. How can they have hover cars but still require drivers? How can they have faster than light communication, but still get reception like a black and white 50s TV? Why are they still using light sabres when the weapon has such a limited range? Why can't they vote electronically remotely?The female senator role is a bit sappy. They should have given her a more spunky part. I discovered Frank Oz (Cookie Monster, Grover) voices Yoda. Yoda is a general. He no longer utters mysterious epigrams.Even though Hayden Christensen is one of the most handsome males ever to grace the screen, he is not convincing in his love speech to the senator. She fell for him despite his declarations of love. He was just too wooden.It explores runaway-revenge, rather deep for a Hollywood movie.The movie ends with a clever take-off on the Roman Coliseum run by cockroaches. Then the movie becomes utterly boring. There is a scene that goes on for what seems like 5 hours battling CGI monsters with light sabres, then another 5-hour fight with a giant CGI army where our heroes are never hit by a bullet but manage to kill everyone, Then another 5- hour light sabre fight. It looks like the bad guy, Count Dooku, inexplicably got away at the end in order to make another movie.",6,1,1,31 October 2016
Burn After Reading," Canadian humour in an American Movie
","The first thing to understand about his movie is it is a comedy. It did not dawn on me until I was well into the movie. I debated whether I should consider revealing this fact a spoiler. I am used to very broad humour in American movies. This was more subtle leg-pulling Canadian style humour. There is a comedy show on CBC Radio called 'This is That' in Canada where every week they suck new listeners into thinking it is a legit soft news show interviewing eccentric people. Listeners phone in to express their outrage at the things the interviewees are proposing. Burn after reading is like the movie version of This is That.I saw the cast including Brad Pitt and George Clooney and expected them to play roles highly charming to females. But Pitt plays a character as strange as Dustin Hoffman's Ratzo Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy or Raymond Babbit in Rainman. He is handsome and sexy as only Brad Pitt can be, but with so many strange verbal and kinetic tics and hair styled by Peewee Herman, he creeped me out.Nearly everybody sleeps with nearly everybody else. It takes great effort to figure out who is married to whom, who is lovers with whom, who is angry about their partner's infidelity and who is not. It is like a kaleidoscope of partners shuffling.You have to keep track not only of the plot twists, but what each character thinks is going on. It is as complicated as a French farce.To add to the complication, John Malkovich and J.K. Simons look somewhat alike, so I sometimes got them confused too.Simons is the perfect actor for the role of CIA chief. He can say anything with a straight face and make it sound completely reasonable and sober. They gave him the final scene. No matter what happens, he takes it in stride. The preposterous of this builds and builds as the situations get more and more insane. Then suddenly I twigged at the utter absurdity of it all and collapsed in laughter.It is a very cleverly constructed movie where the humour sneaks up on you.",7,5,7,16 November 2012
The Bourne Identity," Needs a serious pruning
","The plot of this movie is intriguing. It keeps you constantly thinking. Even at the end, much remains mysterious about who did what why, and even who many of the characters were.If the movie has a message, it is about collateral damage. CIA types completely lose track of the fact they are destroying innocent people's lives. It becomes too much a game for them.I found one fight scene in the movie extremely tedious after an intriguing start with verbal dueling. To my surprise, even fast forwarding, it went on forever. Similarly, for an interminable boring car chase through the streets of Moscow.The movie would greatly benefit from pruning back, or re-filming the fights and chase sequences. They are without imagination and go on far too long.The only fight scene that really worked was the first one in the movie, over in a few seconds between Bourne and the obnoxious young CIA agent. It took your breath away with its precision. The rest of action was a letdown after that.",6,0,1,15 July 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," Beyond Awful
","This one of the worst films ever made. It fails on every level. I thought the original Matrix was brilliant. This has nothing in common but the names of two of the characters.There is no characterisation. The special effects look cartoonish. It is like watching someone else play a shoot-em-up video game for hour after hour after hour.The dialog is stolen from Captain Archer's military posturing in Star Trek Enterprise. The computer-generated monsters scoot about mindlessly and harmlessly as a school of herring.It is almost non-stop space western with fist fights, gun fights and pseudo-military barking.The sort of person who might enjoy this is someone brain damaged fighting in Iraq who misses the mayhem or who subscribes to 'Modern Brain Surgery' for pornographic purposes.",1,1,2,12 October 2006
28 Weeks Later," Worst 12 hours of movie viewing ever
","One of the most unpleasant twelve hours I ever spent was watching this movie waiting for it to end. It was not really 12 hours, it just felt that way. What an utterly boring movie! Almost nothing happens except people killing each other. It is hour upon hour of mindless slaughter, as monotonous as tapes smuggled out of Iraq of American soldiers mowing down children with machine guns. To make matters worse it is filmed in wet poodle cam. They strapped a camera to the back of a shivering wet poodle. On top of that they used old batteries in the camera so it jerks along worse than Edison's originals, with smear/blur special effects effects so most of the time you can't tell who is doing what to whom, just that it is violent and bloody.For the sadistic, there is a remarkable scene where a helicopter pilot mows down a field of people with his rotor blades. Other than that scene there is a total lack of imagination.The plot makes no sense. Why are children allowed into a bio-contaminated area. Why does a man knowingly kiss a woman infected with a deadly virus? Why do the 'zombies' always go after people who are not infected rather than each other? Why is everyone so casual around a disease more terrible than ebola? Why did the Americans invade Britain knowing full well it was infected?",2,2,5,19 May 2007
North by Northwest," Many ways to enjoy
","North By North West was made in 1959. You can enjoy it many ways. Let me enumerate: 1. It a predecessor to the James bond films with oily villains with interesting accents, and questionable sexuality out to kill in imaginative ways, always toying with their victims rather that simply shooting them outright. Cary Grant plays a character who likes brave clever repartee with his captors, though he has none of Bond's lethality, just his confidence.2. it is a love story, with lots of clever repartee.3. it is a comedy. Grant's cleverness and unrestrained originality at getting out of scrapes is amusing as is the existential strangeness of the predicaments.4. It is a period drama. It was filmed in 1959 with a cast of tens of thousands, all in accurate 1959 period costumes, and accurate period cars, in accurate period hotels, restaurants, streets and taxis. All this was much cheaper to do then. It is a treat for the eye.5. It is an adventure story with a car chase, explosions and the famous crop dusting scene, but because the special effects are somewhat dated, this aspect would not have the punch it would originally.6. It is a mystery with all manner twists and terms making you guess who is working for whom. It would probably take at least three viewings to begin to figure out the motives for each character at each point in the film.It is an oldie but goodie.",9,2,3,14 June 2013
"I, Robot"," Much Better than I Expected
","The first thing to understand is Will Smith plays a relatively serious character, not his usual goofy persona. He makes a few wise cracks, but this is not a Men In Black IX.I most enjoyed the scenes of ordinary plausibly realistic daily life, such a robot working an a diner, and the touching scenes reminiscent of 2001 where a robot faced execution. There is an enormous amount of computer animation. Much of the vision of the future is thoughtful and informed by the latest science. It is not just a bunch of people running around in togas and making pretentious speeches.The problem with the movie is it keeps descending into mindless mechanised clone violence that is about as interesting as watching red and black ants fight and about as mindless. In these scenes the animation takes on silly, cheap cartoonish character that blows the illusion of reality. To make it worse, it is unclear who is fighting whom and why. All the robots are identical.",7,0,0,25 October 2008
Divergent," All the charm of an army training film
","Divergent is about a post-war sci-fi world where everyone is divided into one of five clans/casts called factions. They are called erudite, dauntless (athletic militaristic), abnegation (selfless service and government), amity (happy farmers) and candour. Each teen must choose a clan for life. For no apparent reason, the choice cannot be changed. Oddly, even the erudite faction has no educational or training requirements for admission. If the clan eventually rejects them after hazing, they became factionless, similar to homeless in our society.Our heroine goes for a sort of career counselling where they pull out the stops on CGI. It is quite entertaining and mystifying.Unfortunately, our heroine chooses the mindless, loutish, tattooed, militaristic, boorish dauntless faction who do nothing but jump on trains, climb buildings, fight and run in packs.The world is a Republican wet dream where everyone is pitted against each other and the weakest are shamed, deprived and tormented.After a promising start, the movie degenerates into a sort of boot camp army training film. BORING.The whole premise of the movie that having more than one sort of skill is weird and dangerous makes no sense as does the rule you may never change factions.This is a movie for teenagers who fantasise about joining a criminal gang.",3,2,2,26 December 2016
Ender's Game," very loosely based on the book
","The Movie Enders Game is only loosely based on the book. The only similarity I could see was in a one line summary of the plot and the name of the protagonist. 10 year old Ender Wiggin in the book was a little bulldog of a kid, without remorse, introspection or personal relationships. Ender Wiggin in the movie is a skinny, delicate kid with a much more complex character, interested in strategy, seeing the world from the perspective of his opponents, flirting with any females nearby and cleverly assessing any possible advantages and disadvantages in any conflict. He is perhaps the most intelligent fighter in movies. The best parts of the movie are watching him deal with people attacking him. The actor Asa Butterfield is a little too delicate to be believable as Ender the fighter, but he projects the intelligence well. He has some of the magic of a superhero with an unusual power.The movie starts with typical military brainwashing, lots of saluting, push-ups, insulting sergeants, racing to line up... This part bored me to tears. It has been done a million times before. The only difference was some uniforms modelled on the sexy suits motor cycle racers wear.Ender, being younger and skinnier and bright, attracts some really vicious bullying. The administration encourages this. This is a school to learn mass murder after all. Ender deals with this with a combination of intelligence, philosophy and surprise. It is one of the more realistic depictions of bullying I have seen in movies.Then we have the zero-g acrobatics. For what seems an eternity we watch people dangling on wires zooming about in a dome, sometimes clinging to each other. These exercises to me seem completely pointless. These shots obviously took a lot of time and effort to get, and the editor was reluctant to cut them down to reasonable length.The movie is much more explicit than the book. The philosophical musings in the book are handled more with inference.The music was composed by a relative of the guy who did the score for Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments. It was syrupy and heavy handed. It made some otherwise exciting scenes come out silly.Much of the movie is spent watching CGI graphics. No matter how good they are, pictures of planets and space craft blowing up get pretty old pretty quickly.If I were the director, I don't know how I could make this feature film without introducing many more subplots. But I would do a lot of pruning. The director seems to think if seeing thing X is exciting, seeing thing X thrice is three times as exciting.It is a thoughtful movie, about the necessity for restraint in conflict, and becoming too sure you know what you opponent is thinking.I did not see this movie in the theatres, because I was boycotting Orson Scott Card and his anti-gay bigotry, which is not apparent in either the book or the film.",7,3,4,28 October 2014
Ratatouille," No up to the best of Disney standard
","The animation is excellent especially the detailed and rapidly moving backgrounds. There is plenty of slapstick. They spend rather more time that I would like chasing the poor rat Remy all over the place with knives. The dialogue is a bit limp, similar to Ice Age, with only one in-joke for the adults that I noticed. Both the lead characters are supposed to be French, but have not a trace of a French accent. They both have aggressively American accents. I found this jarring. There is only occasional non-descript background music. Disney's best work in contrast puts singable music centre stage. The plot is somewhat predictable. Perhaps the most interesting thing is the way they manipulate the audience alternately to identify with the rats and feel disgust for them.",5,2,6,18 October 2012
Hardball," Sugar with Saccharine Sprinkles
","This is perhaps the most sickenly trite movie I have ever seen. It is entirely predictable. It is so sugary with ersatz emotion you need to shower afterward. It is beyond awful. The soaring violins accompanying trivial accomplishments ring false. There is not an original line in it. It deadly dull. The script could have been composed by a computer chopping up every sports movie ever made and mushing bits together at random. If movies were term papers, this one would the kind composed the night before it was due. I don't know what possessed an actor the calibre of Keanu Reeves to get involved. Perhaps they blackmailed him. Even the score was done on the cheap with a barely adequate rap group.",1,0,2,15 March 2008
Twilight," much better than I expected
","As a gay 66 year old man, I am clearly not part of the intended audience for this film, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it.The film is filled with handsome teenage males, and many homely ugly- Betty goonily-dressed females, including the lead Bella. The boys either strut around looking pretty, with blank expressions, like runway models, or they act like silly hyper active grade 4 school boys. The boys are so inept in their attempts to impress the girls. Bella rudely dismisses them all with a look that says, 'You have got to be kidding. You thought I would have anything to do with you?'Bella is cranky, rude, not very bright, without interests, hobbies or talents. However, she is new to the school, which gives her some appeal.Edward, is considered the ultimate dreamboat by all the girls, but he allegedly considers himself too good for any of them. I thought the explanation was that he gay, but it turned it out was because he was a vampire.All the ugly girls get cute boyfriends in the end, but that fantasy- fulfilment story is very much in the background.To my great surprise the plot of the first half of the film unfolds with the ponderousness of a Jane Austen novel. I never expected that from a teen movie. There is great push pull between Edward and Bella. Edward is trying to control his urges to kill Bella and drink her blood. Bella blithely ignores what he is telling her. The reticence builds an incredible tension. It is similar to the sort of tension people in an earlier day felt trying to avoid sex before marriage or gay sex.What makes no sense is why Edward is attracted to Bella but not the other girls. I decided to pretend it had to do with scent or some vampire-only discernible attribute. The real reason has to do with fantasy fulfilment.Robert Pattinson does a brilliant job of portraying Edward the vampire. His approach is similar to Stephen Moyer playing the courtly vampire Bill Compton in True Blood. He is calm, patient, breathy, intense, old- fashioned. He is handsome, but in an almost non-human sort of way.At one point he says roughly, 'I am the most dangerous predator on the planet. Even my face, by voice and my scent are designed to lure victims.' You look at him, and imagine his exotic scent, he is speaking literal truth. It is like an electric shock. Photographs of him are not sufficient to show what I am talking about.Like the Superman I movie, Edward gradually reveals his powers to Bella. Unlike Lois Lane, Bella is completely unimpressed.The movie shifts gears to comedy, when Edward takes Bella home to meet the 'family'.Then the movie shifts gears again, stealing the special effects from Superman II, where the titans battle.Bella always chooses the most dangerous possible thing to do at each stage. It obviously helps the plot, but it made me want to smack her for being so stupid.Bella within almost minutes of meeting Edward decided she wants marry him. Then a week or so later she decides even marriage is not sufficient commitment. The want him to commit for eternity of life as a vampire. The belief that there was only one true love for me caused me untold misery. I might even go so far as to say it ruined my life. I hate seeing that poison being sold to unsuspecting young girls.",7,4,7,26 September 2014
28 Days Later...," If you like projectile blood vomiting, and rape
","I got this movie to watch on Halloween because it was reputedly a very scary movie. I don't think I felt frightened even once in the entire movie. There is no aching suspense, no sudden jumping out.The lead actor Cillian Murphy is almost impossibly handsome. The camera often takes time out from the mountains of gore to lovingly caress his face and body which sometimes seems so jarringly immaculate it looks as if he just walked off a fashion runway.There is lots of slime and blood and festering, hours of it. There is also what felt like like 10 hours of footage of people bashing each others' brains out in the dark. I could not tell who was bashing who or why.I have never watched a movie where I had less sympathy for any of the characters. Even the 'heroes' were totally selfish opportunists.The rape scenes were supposed to be terrifying, but I could not help but laugh. Why would anyone give a thought to rape when they knew they were about be pounced on at any second by rabid plague victims? The mayhem wore thin very quickly. The villains were as distinctive as the white plastic-coated soldiers in Star Wars.By far the most interesting parts of the movie were about the gritty practicalities of living without electricity, running water, grocery stores or other people.As metaphor, the movie had its moments. It showed how money really is just a token in a social game. Money becomes meaningless in the apocalyptic world. There was one bit of philosophising when a soldier noted that for most of earth's history it had no people, and now with this megaplague, earth was returning to normal. The plague itself is symbolic of the rage that spreads from person to person in modern urban society, erupting in mass violence like the Iraq war.The special effects went on for what seemed like an eternity too, namely wandering through British cities without seeing a even a single car or pedestrian. I suppose these might be more interesting to people familiar with the landmarks with their normal bustle. The effect was supposed to be eerie, but for me, it came across much like visiting a resort town out of tourist season. It has been done too many times before and director Danny Boyle belaboured it. He went on for what felt like hours of it with nothing happening.P.S. I was not on drugs. The time dilation effect comes purely through repetition of the exact same thing over and over and over.",4,1,2,1 November 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," If you have seen the trailer, you can skip the movie
","The movie is constructed of interminable fight scenes strung end to end. They use one special effect over and over. The fighters appear to have the magical ability to almost turn off gravity. They can take long slow motion leaps or run up walls.The net effect is boredom. I fell asleep over and over.The characters are driven by infantile revenge and even more petty motives. They belong to a warrior cast who kill each other for amusement. When someone is killed in this game, they blame the evil killer rather than their participation in the game.The fights involve hitting and kicking each other. These blows have absolutely no effect on the opponent, even when endlessly repeated.There one fight scene in a restaurant and one in a tree canopy that shows more imagination. I found it hard to keep track of who was fighting who and why.There is a bit of comic relief, reminiscent of The Taming of the Shrew between a handsome, good-hearted, desert-dwelling falconer and a pretty young woman who preferred adventure to a stifling life in an arranged marriage.The majority of the fighters are female. I think at least one of them was over 40 and another over 60. They were fully athletic. I expected the fighting to limit actors to their early 20s.Others have recommended this movie. They must have a much higher tolerance for repetition than have I. It is in Chinese, with English subtitles. In one scene, a character is surprised that the 'Jade Fox' villain is female. This seems odd because they have been referred to her as 'she' in the subtitles. In Chinese, they use the same pronoun for he and she, so that pronoun did not give her gender away.",4,2,3,14 November 2016
2012," formulaic disaster movie
","This is a formulaic disaster movie. The 'science' behind it is downright silly. Every time the movie attempts to introduce a bit of science or technobabble, the movie stops because it makes no sense.The danger is often silly and the rescue too far fetched. For example 5 dozens blobs of molten lava miss the minivan by centimeters, yet nary a one hits.The pluses for this movie include: 1. no scrimping on CGI. Everything gets destroyed, parks, religious monuments, political monuments, cities, ships, airplanes, luxury cars, underground factories,...2. It has a large cast. Even the bit parts are played by big name actors.3. The child actors are quite believable.4. Some reasonably interesting philosophical discussions about competition under conditions of scarce resources.5. They play with stereotypes, then gradually dismantle them.",7,1,1,25 August 2013
Across the Universe," Unbearable Nostalgia
","I really enjoyed this movie. It is an unabashed musical packed with more Beatles tunes than I remembered even existed. The singers are brilliant. The boy who plays Jude, Jim Sturgess, is spectacular. He is better than the Beatles. He gives the songs depth, meaning and emotion that they did not have in the bouncy originals. The movie is essentially an opera, with bits of dialogue to tie together the musical numbers into a clever strangely uncontrived story. Each song usually begins with a minute or two a capella, perfectly sung. There are usually about ten people in the background dancing, or doing something or just looking colourful. It is like a non-stop visual torrent washing over your eyes. The choreography is original avoiding repetition.The movie reminds me of Grease and Peter Fonda's early movie, The Trip. It also reminds of my youth. It is pretty realistic for how surreal it was.The nostalgia was so thick it made me cry a few times. At one point Sadie did a Janice Joplin impersonation. Ouch!It is not a particularly light entertainment. It is set against the brutality of the powers that be who brought you the Viet Nam War. The depiction of the violence is mostly surreal. Yet it got under my skin even more that blunt realism would. I have seen so much of that my hide is tough. There was one scene when you watch from a distance as two soldiers deliver notice the beloved son has died and the reaction of the mother and girlfriend. I have never seen that done so powerfully before.The ending was so predictable and so saccharine I felt let down, quite unlike the rest of the movie, but at least they clipped it short.",9,1,2,7 June 2014
Ex Machina," Slow paced
","There are three main characters, Nathan who owns the world's largest search engine company. He is an acknowledged a genius. He is obnoxious the way he uses his wealth and fame to bully others and treat them as toys. He uses his search engine to spy on everyone on earth. He is a jerk, in much the same way Steve Jobs was.Caleb is his employee, a talented, pleasant, handsome, young nerd. Ava is Nathan's AI creation.All the action occurs in Nathan's high-tech, high-security house hidden miles away from anything in the mountains. Nathan uses electronic key cards to lock people into rooms for his amusement.Supposedly, Caleb's job is to test Ava to see if she could pass a modified Turing test when he would interact with her face to face.Most of the movie is either awkward flirtatious getting to know you conversations between Caleb and Ava or Nathan being a prick tormenting Caleb. The pace is glacial. The dialogue is quite non-technical and reasonably sophisticated for Hollywood.One of the themes the movie explores is how do you know when people/robots are lying to you, and when are people/robots just pretending to like you.As you would expect, Nathan gets his just deserts, but the movie has an unexpectedly gruesome dark and somewhat confusing ending. It is not at all the happy ending I expected. It left me feeling ill.",8,0,2,12 January 2017
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," On Getting Dumped Without Explanation
","Disclaimer. I am a 66 year old gay male, not the intended target for this movie. I probably reacted to it in a different way than the average viewer will.Twilight The Saga: New Moon is a much darker movie than Twilight I.For many people, myself included, being dumped by a lover who you madly adored, unexpectedly, without explanation is by far the worst event of your life. This happens to Bella Swan. Usually, a movie would gloss over this bleakness in a few seconds of clichés. But Twilight sits on it for almost the whole movie, and explores the pain with some imagination. It also explores not wanting ever to be involved again, and forever holding back. It explores the way you hold onto the flimsiest shred of hope your true love will eventually come back and the imaginary conversations. It even tackles suicide. It may be a downer, but everyone who has been through this will identify.Often on-screen are a number of similar-looking, rain-soaked, muscular, shirtless young men who have the annoying habit of transforming into CGI wolves, followed by stock footage of CGI wolves fighting. These scenes could just as well have been realistic animations of suburban dogfights over unspayed females for all their originality.Taylor Lautner, who plays Jacob Black, has an astounding body with an eye-popping perfection that reminded be of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator I, though not as bulky. Lautner has a heart-meltingly handsome face. He is as lovable as a puppy, but he is too wooden. When he recites his lines in his urban nasal voice, I think of some awkward kid in a school play. It is like he does not believe what he is saying. He is just reading the lines. Further, his character is a bit like L'il Abner compared with the tortured complex Edward Cullen, so he is intrinsically not anywhere near as interesting. Joseph's shtick is being considerate, kind and gentle one minute and a rageoholic the next, like the Incredible Hulk, a cautionary tale for those who are attracted to the type.Bella often gets herself in trouble, but not with the nail-biting relentlessness of the first movie. The adrenalin level of this movie is much lower. It is more about heart-sickness than danger.The most amusing line in the movie, is from vampire, Alice Cullen, played by Ashley Green, about Bella 'I have never met anyone so prone to life-threatening idiocy', as aside to the audience acknowledging the rather strained plot to keep Bella in predicaments.Like the original movie, it drifts back and forth between reality, magic realism and dream deliberately confusing you.The happy ending is so cruel. It will deceive so many into thinking if they but put their life on hold yet another decade, their heart's desire will be fulfilled.The most irritating feature of the movie: Bella drove me nuts with her juvenile concern with her relationship with Edward lasting forever and selfishly ignoring nurturing her relationships today.",7,3,5,11 December 2014
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Unbearable nostalgia
","Benjamin Button's reverse ageing is mainly an excuse to ponder ageing and death with a little extra distance.The movie takes place from 1918 to 2003. The actors are shown at all ages in between. I could not for the life of me figure out when they used different actors when makeup, and when CGI magic. In the early part of the movie, Brad Pitt seems to be only about four feet tall and hunched. I don't know how they did it.The ageing/deageing effects were very subtle and gradual. I could not notice them except by recalling previous reels.They kept de-aging Pitt through his teens, as a child and as a baby. It was like an electric shock to see Pitt, again, as dazzling as he once was in Thelma and Louise all through some sort of movie magic. He not only deages, he becomes god-like handsome shocking everyone used to his mousey self.Benjamin Button's accent changes quite dramatically over the movie. I have to presume this was deliberate. He was picking up the accent of whomever he had been hanging out with.The movie must have been very expensive, since there were sets and cars of every year in the range.The main action takes place in a poorly lit, sombre home for the dying. There are many funerals and catastrophes. I felt unbearable heartache and nostalgia.",9,0,1,9 February 2017
Lincoln," A history lesson
","This is a movie that makes Americans proud of their heritage. They need it after the shame of Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo. It is about the politics of passing the 13th Amendment, the abolishment of slavery. Ironically it would not have happened had the south not seceded. It was sold to a rather bigoted country of the time as a tactic to win the war. To get people to do the right thing, Lincoln's people had to bribe and cajole in ways that sound familiar today in the corrupt game of politics.The movie would probably sail over the heads of most children or bore them. It's about dirty politics.The are so many familiar faces, disguised under makeup and wigs, all having a wonderful time hamming it up. The movie reminds me a bit of the Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston saying his lines as if every word would be recorded for all eternity with a background of soaring strings. It is not that corny, but it has that taking-itself-too-seriously feel.There are hundreds of congressmen and onlookers all in costume debating in the house. It must have cost a mint to film. Everyone is doing something so incredibly full of energy. It felt somewhat phony to me, sort of metaphoric Kodachrome.Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln as quite believable, with his squeaky voice and penchant for telling meandering stories to make a point rather than bluntly disagreeing. He hams it up much less than the other actors.The movie leaves out most of the war, Lincoln's depression, Mary Todd Lincoln's mental troubles, the death of his son, and even to a large extent, the assassination.I would like it if every adult American saw this movie. It might put a clearer perspective on today's equality issues, women, gays, transgender, immigrants...",9,1,2,9 July 2014
Children of Men," zombie movie without any zombies.
","I saw the words 'P.D. James' and expected something like a British murder mystery. It is not. It essentially a zombie film without literal zombies. A small group of people try to travel in Britain from A to B, and all kinds of crazy people with guns try to kill them, and largely succeed. There are more stunt men and extras than you can shake a stick at. I found it extremely boring. Why all this violence? It has something to do with mankind becoming completely infertile. Why this would turn everyone into homicidal maniacs is beyond me.One of the particularly nasty villains has blond dreadlocks. I was waiting for him to have some imaginative demise, but he just unceremoniously and silently fell over backward, presumably shot by a bullet, unremarked in a corner of the screen.There are no good looking people, and no morally courageous people, so I did not become particularly attached to the protagonists. I did not particularly care if the bad guys got them. This does not help the suspense much.The film just ends as if the reel ran off the projector, as if chopped off by a timer at no particular place. There is no resolution. You don't even get to find out what happens to the heroes over the next few days.What is the movie for? Perhaps it is just to show how unglamourous and pointless war is. It spoofs the complete lack of motive for all the mayhem in war.",4,5,8,15 December 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," heavy duty torture and sexual violence
","This is a strange movie. Much it is watching people do searches on computers, adjust surveillance cameras, flip dusty ledger pages, and look through old photographs all with deadly intensity with the music signifying every pixel is of deep significance. Then it suddenly flips to scenes of ghastly torture and sexual violence. I had to leave the room. The villains are just so twisted, you can't help but enjoy the poetic justice eventually handed out to them. The heroine is a weird duck. She won't volunteer any information about herself, and she behaves unlike anyone else in film. She is officially mentally ill. I think she is inter-sexed with strong male muscles and female nipples. The film, oddly, has one of the happiest endings I can remember. The film is in Swedish(Danish?) with subtitles. My roommate and I had great fun looking for English cognates. It turns out Swedish (Danish?) is much more like English that I thought it would be. The wintry Swedish (Danish?) countryside reminds me of my home Canada, but it is definitely different. I found the Swedish ambiance the thing I enjoyed most about the movie, the wood stoves, fireplaces, stark furniture.",7,0,4,4 July 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," Not the Bourne Identity
","This is not a thriller as billed, but a relatively slow paced sci fi story. Matt Damon as David Norris is a little older and a little heavier that he was, still pleasant looking but not suck your breath in handsome.The villains are quite unlike movie villains. They are cosmic humanoids with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder who like to micro manage the fine details of human lives without them finding out about it who think of themselves as angels. Rather than evil, they are more like meddling aunts. The plot is reminiscent of Men In Black though not quite so silly. David Norris never figures anything out on his own. Everything is tediously explained to him by the aliens.In the opening scenes David Norris runs for office. They use real-life political commentators like Jon Stewart, Wolf Blitzer and James Carville in a completely realistic way.The movie can be interpreted in an religious way. Is there a religious hierarchy meddling with our lives, including deliberately creating death and massive heartache? The aliens have a set of wormhole doors that let them jump from one part of the city to another. The special effect is extremely easy to film, and the director used the technique over and over and over.The movie feels as if it has a lot of padding, e.g. that skyline is pretty, but it does nothing to develop the plot or character. To work, it needs a massive rewrite of the book to tighten up the pace and to make the villains a bit more ominous.",6,0,2,11 August 2013
Black Snake Moan," Perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen
","This is an unusual movie in that I instantly detested all the protagonists. It is hard to enjoy a movie when you don't care what happens to the protagonists. I would have been happy to have a church fall on all of them.I hated Rae (Christina Ricci) from the first seconds and never warmed to her. She was so full of herself, and so selfish. She blocked traffic just for the sheer hell of it. She dressed like a rape victim then viciously verbally slashed any male than noticed. She smoked and drank incessantly. She slouched her way through life in a screw-you pose. She was a slut. That rarely bothers me in a character, but she just rubs your nose in her trashiness. She was literally a nymphomaniac who pounced anyone with no discrimination. She is quite disgusting, like some animal of another species with a yen for human coupling. You are supposed to excuse her behaviour because she was molested as a child. I know lots of women who were molested, but none behaved anything like Rae.Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) was a religious nut who kidnapped and a chained woman. He lived out a sort of heavy duty Taming of the Shrew fantasy.Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) left his girlfriend to kill people in the army. He expected his slut of a girlfriend to be true to him, and was crazy jealous and violent.The preacher pounded out treacle and ignored the fact his friend Rae chained up in his kitchen.Even the 15 year old virgin who Rae pounced was such a stupid twit he did not report Rae being chained up.Other extremely unlikeable people included Rae's mother, Ronnie's best friend and Lazarus's friend who bates Ronnie for returning early from the army.About the only person in the movie close to pleasant is the pharmacist with a bit part.Rae spends most of the movie in her panties with her boobs falling out, often pretending to be masturbating or at least in heat (a phrase from the movie). She is chained and beaten repeatedly. This is soft S&M porn, that tries to redeem itself with some Christian glob piled on top.About the only good thing I could say about the movie is Samuel L Jackson sings quite a few times, and does a creditable job, especially the bar scene. That scene with dancers is roaring fun romp.",2,4,13,10 July 2012
The Insider," Biased?
","The lead review complains 'The only negative was the obvious Liberal bias'.What an odd thing to say. It is like saying The Guns Of Navarone had an anti-German bias.This was a _story_ of battling an evil corporation. Big Tobacco was the villain. You can bet big tobacco behaved even worse in real life than they did in the movie where the producers could be sued. Big tobacco killed off their customers for heaven's sake.Would the author of that review call for even handed treatment of James Bond and his villains in the name of political correctness? What tepid entertainment we would have if all villains had to be whitewashed in the name of a distorted notion of fairness. Some people are evil, and it a lie to pretend otherwise.",8,1,2,7 May 2011
Into the Wild," an ordeal
","This is a movie that is painful to watch. It is about 2.5 hours long. Like Romeo and Juliet you can see the dreadful end telegraphed long in advance. Chris is a charming boy, handsome, friendly, kind, heroically adventurous, idealistic, intelligent and a bit of a flake. The many people he encounters are a bit weird, but kindly too. The movie takes you all over the USA photographing some of the most beautiful and most desolate places.I don't know how they did it, but Chris shrinks to a wraith over the period of months trying to survive in the Alaska wilderness.The movie has some sickeningly corny Hallmark moments, such as when Chris and Mr. Franz laugh on the mountain, or his materialistic father and mother kneel in church. But most of the time the characters ring true, if eccentric.Chris is exuberant like a little boy. Most of the characters in the movie all want to reach out and protect him, just as you the viewer do as well. But you cannot.William Hurt as the stern father does a scene that should have won him an Oscar, where he just loses it and sits down in the middle of the road. The pain was etched on his face completely convincingly and in a way that was so painful to watch you had to look away.The big surprise of the movie is even though Chris died at a very young age, he had more adventure packed in his short life than most people have in a lifetime. Because of that, his early death was not that tragic. Even Chris recognises this.",8,0,1,22 January 2012
Elysium," A Disappointment
","Elysium came highly recommended. However I found it disappointing.It is set in the future, but mirrors earth today. The 'Republicans' live in a gated community, but in orbit. The rest of the population live in squalor similar to a Brazilian favella. The goal of every person on earth is to live in this golden community.The people who live there have no compassion whatsoever. They remotely run the corporations on earth that have no regard for safety or working conditions, like Nike in Thailand. They use robocop like droids to keep the earthlings in check and drones like Obama. They happily kill any potential trespassers.The Republican have astounding advanced technology for healing, but they won't share it with the earthlings, for much the same reason blacks were spat on.There is not much subtlety in the parallels.Matt Damon is hideous. They shaved off his hair, covered him in tattoos, a Borg suit (presumably to give him strength) burns and scars. I did not like seeing his beauty defiled that way.Jodie Foster plays the icy leader of the Republicans. She plays the part perfectly, projecting complete composure and elegance.However, most of the movie is watching mindless CGI of hovering vehicles, droids and explosions. It just goes on and on and on. It is boring!There does not seem to be any point to most of the violence. The combatants have no motive. They just like fighting.There are some extremely phony dramatic tension moments that just don't make any sense at all. The people don't interact much. Not even the villains have much interaction with their victims. On the other hand, that is the point of the movie. These people have no compassion for anyone.",5,0,1,7 April 2014
Once Upon a Time in America," Too graphically violent
","I had to give up on this movie after only about 5 minutes. The violence was so brutal, so gross and so realistic I just said 'I don't need this' It properly belongs in the category of S&M not drama.This is far more violent and sadistic than the Godfather series.I would call it sick. I can't think of any other movie that came close in gross out ability not even a Harvard documentary about tribes in Indonesia killing each other in ritual warfare I saw as a teen back in the 60s. The movie is quite long and I saw just the beginning. Perhaps it redeems itself later. But that opening was too much for me to take.",3,5,19,6 April 2006
Avatar," tedious battle scenes
","From the reviews I read, I expected Avatar to be sleepy, something like watching beautiful sea dragons courting, but it is a typical Star Wars shoot 'em up, a somewhat tedious shoot 'em up. The villains are military, corporate bigots. There are references to the Viet Nam, the Afghan and Iraq wars, and the genocides of the first nations people. It is also about the way these villains take a satanic joy in destroying the natural world. I suspect most of the people who panned the movie for lack of plot were Republicans irritated at seeing all their oxen gored.The movie is a metaphor for the uncaring violence of the military, the rampant greed of the corporation and the mindless prejudice of the xenophobe. Oddly, the hero, who infiltrates the off worlders in a surrogate body (avatar), is a marine, doltish but handsome as the stereotypical marine. In the end he leads a romantic, violent, Custer's last stand revolt against the powers of evil. Despite the fact much of the movie is battle scenes, there is little gore. The most shocking scene was a bleeding 6-legged horse.The animation is so well done, often I figured it must be characters in makeup. There is all kinds of subtlety in the fine movement of face muscles. The extreme faces of the off worlders are fascinating to watch. You don't think of it as animation. It is just a unfamiliar world where you have no reference points on how things should look. The thing I most enjoyed about the movie was the imagination that went into creating the off-world fantastic plants and animals, that were often impossible, but there you saw them clearly 'real'. The detail was so exquisite it compelled me to believe in their existence even though my science background was screaming TILT. The joke of the movie is that technology allowed human actors to inhabit alien bodies, both in the process of making the movie, and inside the movie itself, though the technology was quite different. The thing that bothered me most was how preposterously overpopulated the Pandora forest was. It looked like downtown Tokyo. Someone got carried away with the AI clone tool.",7,1,5,19 March 2012
The Great Raid," An anachronistic Embarrassment
","I caught this on KVOS, a station that often shows vintage films. The film was so jingoistic I though it must have been made during WWII. I about to write to the station about selecting such a silly preposterously biased film in these politically-sensitive days, that depicts the American as god-like creatures slaying the reptilians Jap hordes. At times it is as turgid as Charleton Heston in the Ten Commandments. When I looked it up, to my astonishment, I discovered it was made in 2005. Yet it smells as silly and overdone as those Woody Woodpecker or Popeye WWII propaganda films.I take it this film was created as a propaganda piece to sell the Afghan and Iraq wars, by harking back to WW II glory.The musical score is like something out of the 50s with soaring strings and dramatic crescendos, very melodramatic. The film quality is fuzzy too with bad colour, again like a film from WW II. Perhaps that was deliberate to make the film appear to be made in that era.In summary this film has no value other than as propaganda.",2,2,10,7 August 2010
Departures," a very sad movie
","This is a very sad movie. Most of the movie involves a Japanese ceremony called coffining, publicly preparing the dead for burial. The lead actor Masahiro Motoki is handsome and boyish, and plays his role with comic ham exaggeration. It is not much about cellos.This is the first time I had any appreciation how ceremonies elegantly performed can help people over the trying humps in life.Part of the sadness comes from Daigo and his wife giving up grand dreams and settling for more ordinary ones.Part of it comes simply from realising everyone is gradually getting older and will inevitably die.",7,1,1,16 April 2012
The Da Vinci Code," James Bond meets Carrie's Mother
","I went to the film to see what all the fuss was about. I just about burst out laughing in the early scenes when I realised this James Bondian film was being taken as actual fact by some people.The evil, handsome, masochistic, religious nutcase, almost albino monk Silas, played by Paul Bettany, ranks up there with the best of the Bond villains.The Lourve in Paris dripping with French flavour and French dialog gave it that snazzy, international, ultra-wealthy, Bondian flavour.Ian McClellan, as a grail scholar, was a hoot to watch and a treat to the ear to listen to, especially his line 'starting with him'.The movie had more plot twists and double crosses than an Agatha Christie mystery. You never knew who the good guys were even after the movie ended. I have never seen a movie with so many competing sets of villains, each of whom is convinced he is the good guy. You experience the movie from the point of view of the bewildered Tom Hanks, a mild mannered university professor swept up into the supercharged world of Christian fanaticism, where faith justifies any crime. Hanks seems to be saying over and over to himself 'What the heck is going on? Who ARE these people? Why are they doing this?' This echoes your own bewilderment. However, the bewilderment is not merely irritating, but tantalising. You figure that any moment you will figure it out.The reason the movie is controversial is that it puts not only individual Christians in a bad light, but the entire religious establishment. Both the 'heroes' and 'villains' are equally nuts in this movie, fueled by ridiculous self-righteousness and exaggerated importance of trivia.To me, it was absurd people would kill each other for centuries over a difference of opinion whether Jesus had a daughter born after his death.The rather strained narrative sections use a novel cinematographic technique of showing history reenacted in a surreal sort of hologram, with a cast of thousands. Christian viewers had their noses rubbed in it as Hanks and McKellan reviewed the dark side of the history of the church, though Hanks lies in claiming science supports the existence of a historical Jesus.I found myself wanting to shout out to the actors to 'look out' since again and again they took no precautions whatsoever as danger closed in on them. It just about drove me crazy how many times the protagonists were such dolts when it came to self-preservation.Many things rang false to the point of being silly, e.g. the use of Halmark Greeting Card English on supposedly medieval Italian artifacts, and the initial premise, that a dying man would spend his last hours composing an elaborate religious treasure hunt for his granddaughter, starting by carving clues into his body, or the utter lack of security on the famous paintings at the Louvre.There are some delightful politically correct touches, such as the advantages of the tiny Smart car, and the use of penis symbolism in the military.It's a long movie, but you won't be bored. Just the locations/sets alone are enough to keep you entertained.There are a few realistic scenes of ritualistic self flagellation and mutilation. I had to look away. If you take young children, take appropriate precautions to avoid terrifying them.",8,4,8,28 May 2006
Ice Age," Lame
","This is the worst feature length cartoon I have ever seen. I usually enjoy the genre as much as any kid. The problem is the lack of originality. Ice Age feels like those old Matlock episodes they would create by cutting together from previous ones. It is like they cranked previous cartoons through some AI morpher to create pseudo-new content.Manfred the Mammoth has a leading role. He has not a funny bone in his body. He is depressed, rude, a bully and self-centred, hardly a likable hero. He would be a fine side character, but he wastes huge amounts of screen time. He is BORING! For the genre to work, it really needs danceable, singable music.John Leguizamo, as Sid, was up to Lion King quality, but that was not enough to carry the show.",3,0,1,1 July 2010
August Rush," corny as Kansas in August
","August Rush is as corny as Kansas, but it still works. The plot is completely predictable though preposterously improbable. The suspense is in just how long they are going to delay the climax. It is magic realism about a boy Freddie Highmore playing Evan Taylor aka August Rush who has a supernatural talent to pick up any instrument and instantly start improvising in a creditable way. He even magically learns musical notation without any instruction or ever seeing written music.A young Jonathan Rhys Meyers (King Henry VIII in the Tutors), as the father, has a face like a piece of art. It is hypnotic, menacing and sexy. The camera gives you plenty of time to contemplate it.Must of the movie is watching people pretend to sing or pretend to play musical instruments. To a lay eye, it is all quite convincing. I think Jonathan Rhys Meyers actually sang his parts. He made a quite credible rock musician.The boy is inspired by the incidental sounds around him to create music with matching rhythms and textures. The way the movie flows from one to the other is brilliant and a treat for the ear.Robin Williams plays a Fagin-like character forces child street musicians to hand over their take. He is quite creepy. You don't think of him as Robin Williams. He IS a crazy, greedy, unscrupulous old coot.Leon Thomas III as a fellow street urchin/musician stole every scene he appeared in.The weakest actor is Highmore, who is too bland and generic a little boy.Jamia Simone Nash, a little black girl, knocked my socks off with her performance in a church choir. I hope we see her again in some other movie. Her part was way too short. I got the feeling I was getting to see Whitney Houston at age 9.The thing that bugged me most was August's supposedly original composition selected by the Juliard school of music was a complete rip-off of Bach, an interesting arrangement, but not an original composition.It leaves you feeling good with its impossibly happy ending.",Null,1,1,27 September 2012
Sherlock Holmes," Original
","I have always been a great Sherlock Holmes fan. I grew up on Basil Rathbone and later Jeremy Brett. This version is so original in so many ways. I think it is the best ever. First the sets. You get to walk down street after street in 19th century London, streets packed with people and horses. You get to wander about in building after building. You get to travel up and down the Thames river. You get to cross the bridges. It gives the feeling of being a tourist wandering at random in a time warp. It is such a feast for the eyes. There is no stinting ever. Holmes and Watson and young and combative. They complain about each other. Watson is not the traditional all-suffering. He is feisty. There is quite a bit of physical fighting, a bit too much for my taste. However, to make it interesting, they invented a new fighting style, vaguely reminiscent of kung foo, and a whole new way to photograph it. The movie plays with the supernatural. The villain appears to have supernatural powers. You see different degrees of skepticism. You find yourself wondering how they can possibly explain everything without the supernatural. It is all explained at the end, Agatha Christie style. The plot whips along at breakneck pace. It quite hard to keep up trying figure out who is doing what and why. The villain gets his just deserts with unusually poetic justice.",8,0,1,28 February 2014
The Good Shepherd," Nothing like Bourne Identity
","This is nothing like the Bourne Identity movies. Here Matt Damon plays an icy, emotionless, dutiful CIA nerd.The movie is quite slow paced. The violence happens almost unexpectedly, every once in a while in the corner of the screen, with unemotional, bored brutality. People are killed simply because them might know something and might tell someone (as if most people hearing would give a damn). All that matters is American self interest (defined as what is good for corporate America is good for everyone). They need no excuse to break international law or behave in as degenerate bullies. There is no sense of fair play. It is done expediently without investigation, trial or reflection. It is done with all the emotion an exterminator might kill a rat.It seems every actor who appeared on stage was someone I had seen many times before or I knew their name. It is quite a fun effect. It a takes a little while to get used to the new persona they are projecting for this movie.The movie jumps wildly over time between about 1925 and 1962. If you forget what time it is supposed to be, you will be soon discombombulated trying to make sense of the plot.Eddie Redmayne plays Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie's son as a late teen. His performance was absolutely spectacular. It might be the best acting I have ever seen in my life. It is a small part, but rich because Eddie's emotions range all over the map. In one scene Eddie finds out his father probably just had his pregnant fiancé killed. It is an incredibly powerful scene between father and son. It felt like the floor fell out from under me with the gravity of the crime. It felt like it was happening to me. Most portrayals of teens are so clichéd. Eddie is one of a kind. He has a face and expressions that you can't look away from. He is just so interesting. In a way the fascination might be similar to watching an alien. He is not like most actors. He is more real, more 3D.",8,1,4,1 January 2014
Arrival," chaotic and irritating
","The movie is underexposed. The sound is muddy. I think they did this deliberately to enhance the mysteriousness of the squid creatures from outer space. But the net result is you can't tell what is going on.The movie is very confusing, jumping about chaotically in space and time with very few clues where you are. It is downright irritating.The heroine is quite insipid.The plot makes no sense. Our heroine is yanked out of bed in the middle of the night by military types to try to decrypt an alien language. Why her? She speaks Pakistani. Huh?? She is put in charge, then no one listens to what she says. They don't just disagree, they refuse to let her say anything.They crack the code in two breakthroughs without explanation. The heroine discovers she can see the future with absolute clarity. Oddly, she had never noticed any such ability before. Seriously?? Everyone but her wants to go to war with the squid people. She prevails, but what she did to change all those minds is a mystery.For the last bit of the dialogue, they pasted together Hallmark card verses. It is nauseatingly saccharine.Nothing in the movie makes sense. It is maddening as a mosquito bite.",4,5,8,16 April 2017
The Blind Side," Not really a football movie
","When this movie drifts into football it becomes totally predictable and boring. The game on the screen is necessarily fixed and staged. There is no tension as in a real athletic contest. It is like watching a re-run. You have seen the same plot formula 100 times before.Happily, most of this movie is not about playing football.The Sandra Bullock character is great fun, a take off on the bossy competent southern woman. She is SO audacious I burst out laughing time and time again.The Quinton Aaron character holds very little interest.The plot is completely predictable and sugary.The most writing originality was Michael's little 'brother' negotiating with college football coaches.I watched this movie because Sandra Bullock was in it. That is the main reason to watch it.",6,1,1,9 May 2012
The Queen," Harsh but Compassionate Portrait of Queen Elizabeth
","This is an unusual movie, because I have 'known' the main characters Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip and Prince Charles all my life. I have not actually met them, but I have been in their presence and of course seen them in the media, starting with Movietone newsreels as a toddler. They have often appeared as characters in my dreams, as casual acquaintances of mine. Similarly, I have a strong feeling about what Tony Blair is like. Princess Diana, and her brother 'play' themselves. The adoring and grieving crowds 'play' themselves from old newsreel footage.The movie is about times surrounding Princess Di's death. It is about the contrast between private and public lives. It shows you how royal and public lives are orchestrated by others. The Queen and Blair don't even write their own speeches. Like skilled actors, they recite them off teleprompters with artificial sincerity.I remember Di's funeral, listening on the radio in my Quadra Island cabin in the woods, hearing the hooves of the horses in the funeral procession and the hush of a large crowd. I had no idea how large those crowds were or how upset everyone was, or how garish it all was, reminiscent of those balloon and teddy bear shrines at accident sites. To my ears then, the funeral seemed more a dignified occasion of state, something that should be accompanied by Purcell's Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary.I was quite surprised at how unsympathetic a portrait the movie portrayed of the royal family. I did not expect something so harsh while the principals were all still alive. Even though the queen was portrayed as ice cold, dripping irony, you understood this was the way she was ruthlessly trained all her life. The only thing that matters to her is decorum, precedent and protocol. She is stuck in her stiff upper lip WWII role.I tried several times in the movie to see Helen Mirren as she was in Prime Suspect beneath the makeup. I could not. She WAS the queen.The extreme deference people show the queen, (e.g. backing out of rooms where she is present and bowing), and her fabulous wealth in lands I did not appreciate until I saw this movie, nor her intense sense of entitlement simply because she held the office of queen.I agree with Tony Blair's wife. The monarchy is a archaic institution. It needs to be abolished. It is both unfair to force anyone to play this rigid role for a lifetime, and to give such extreme privilege to anyone based on an accident of birth. We should elect celebrities to play such ceremonial roles for limited terms.",8,0,1,9 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," a disappointment
","I have seen two other Star Wars movies. I very much enjoyed them. This one was boring. The plot: some people fight each other. Most of the time is spent watching CGI explosions and tiny CGI spacecraft swarming about like mosquitoes.The main thing to recommend it is females get to participate. The sets are dark and vague as if there were not enough budget to fill in the details.It is somewhat distressing seeing Luke Skywalker, Hans Solo and Princess Leia looking so old and decrepit.The craft which have propulsion systems far more advanced than ours use WWII-style weapons hanging below the craft in a bubble with hand targeting without instruments to assist. I guess it makes better theatre, but to me, it just looks silly.The best scene is a restaurant with creatures from all over the universe. It reminded be of the bar scene in the original.Hans Solo used 'parsecs' as a unit of time instead of distance. That is a gaffe that even a science-literate child would catch.Even when they finally find Luke Skywalker, you would expect him to do some amazing rescue, but the movie just ends before even says anything.",4,20,23,30 October 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Maddeningly Inconsistent Quality
","If you have read the books, don't go see the movie. It is frustrating to have your own magical visions turned into comic strip characters.However, the hobbits are delightfully done, endearing as bunnies. The makeup is realistic. The only catch is the hobbits seem to change size from human to half human size and back from scene to scene. The king of the elves is blond and magical looking, though again he seems to change size from scene to scene. The Dwarf is bang on, if a tad stereotyped.Golem kept me guessing. Was he an actor, a puppet, computer animation? a mixture? In my imagination he would be a black otter-like slimy creature. This Golem was quite different, and riveting. In nearly all the scenes, except the one just before his death, he seemed quite real. I don't think I have ever seen a more lifelike 'monster' in the movies before.The backgrounds throughout the movie are spectacular and true to the spirit of the books.A huge hunk of the movie is given over to mindless breastbeating prior to battle. Every pro-war cliché from every book and every movie and every politician is thrown in. The corny battle plot is stolen from Rocky.The battle scene goes on for what feels like forever. It as boring as watching someone else play a video game. Corny cartoonish wart hogs, flying dragons and elephants swoop about doing dominance displays like some Kong movie. It even has Pac-Man ghosts and giant eagles. It just plain silly with one touch of extreme grossness -- catapulting decapitated heads into the castle.In the books, the terror comes from fear of the unknown, from the dark. There is none of that in the movie. The danger is as explicit as a cowboy comic book.The part 3 by itself does not properly explain why the ring corrupts, why it is so addictive, which is the key to the trilogy. The ring just seems to cause stomach upset, and a childish petulance leading to wanting to hold the ring.The ending is revoltingly saccharine and clichéd. They laid the sweetness on so thick I felt like throwing up. The hobbits are lovable in themselves. They don't need the 'laughing' ending like an episode of the Real McCoys, or a couple wandering hand in hand off into the sunset.",7,0,4,29 December 2006
The Matrix," Most Intelligent Action Movie I have Ever Seen
",Here is an action movie that keeps you thinking. It is endlessly intriguing with its metaphors and the grandness of its premise.Reeves creates the illusion is YOU deciding whether to take the 'red pill' or the 'blue bill'. The tension pulling in both directions is so strong even if you know which choice is demanded by the plot for the Hollywood movie to continue.Most sci-fi movies feel like horse westerns in latex drag. This one pulls you into a high tension alternate universe where you scarcely dare breathe.The truth of what is going on is too complex to be explained in a few pat sentences. It gradually has to be revealed. Usually sci-fi seems to be aimed at young teens. This movie was aimed over my head. I loved the stretch.,9,0,1,15 May 2006
The Great Gatsby," Rocky Horror Remake
","This movie is the fifth remake. I'll compare it with the 1974 version with Robert Redford as Jay Gatsby, Mia Farrow as Daisy Buchanan, Bruce Dern as Tom Buchanan, Karen Black as Myrtle Wilson and Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway.Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan did a memorable performance. He was the real star of the picture. His character was quite complex and volatile. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby was much more interesting than Redford. Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway was spot on. However, Isla Fisher as Myrtle Wilson played her role as a frivolous Kewpie doll, hardly one to inspire passion. Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan had as much sparkle as an overcooked noodle. Perhaps they wanted that blandness to help explain her reaction to her later hit and run. It made no sense two men would be fighting over her. She was just a pretty face.The first half of the movie reminded me of Rocky Horror Picture Show -- huge numbers of people dancing wildly in bizarre costumes suggesting sexual abandon to come. I expected 1920's period costumes. Instead I got 1920's-inspired costumes, wildly imaginative and dazzling. The makeup and hairstyles too were 1920's inspired, but much more glamorous than anything you would actually have seen in the period. I got 1920's- inspired dancing that was a cross between the Charleston and hip hop. I wanted 1920's music. I got a fusion of 1920's and various other surprising genres.DiCaprio is the picture of a billionaire with his immaculate pale pink suit and not a hair out of place. He just exudes wealth and confidence. However, he was a little young to be believable in the role.For the second half, the movie then settled in to straight-forwardly telling the story of adultery and unbridled passion which at the time was much more of a big deal than it is today.The movie probes the relationship between Gatsby and Nick much more deeply than in 1974, constantly asking why is Gatsby so interested in Nick? It never answers. Gatsby is clearly heterosexual, obsessed with Daisy. I think he just needs someone without treachery as a friend almost like a pet person. Nick is bedazzled by Gatsby's wealth and power.",8,0,2,11 July 2014
