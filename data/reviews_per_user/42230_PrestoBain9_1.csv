Requiem for a Dream," Aronofsky: A truly unique, refreshing voice
","Darren Aronofsky is one of the, scratch that, THE preeminent voice in maintstream contemporary cinema.  No other filmmaker today, or ever (Yes, that's right, I just said 'ever' and FULLY understand what that means), has produced work with such a stunningly profound voice and level that he has. Ever. It simply just hasn't happened yet. By following such an engaging film as Pi with one as Requiem, it only proves beyond the shadow of a doubt, that, he is for real, for better or worse.  And even though his early attempts have had the subtle, unmistakable traces of immaturity thus far, if I could offer only one suggestion / word-of-advice for ANYONE who reads this message, it would be this: Take heed, he is just simply THAT good.",Null,0,0,10 April 2003
