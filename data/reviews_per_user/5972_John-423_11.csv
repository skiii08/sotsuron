The Ring," A good start, but a poor adaptation of the original
","********************WARNING:SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!************************
Well, after putting it off all week I finally got around to seeing the RING and I must say, they did far better than I thought, but still managed to make the film laughably mediocre compared to the original. First off, the lineage and many of the characters most interesting quirks were dropped in the American version in favor of dumbing down for the typically less attentive audiences, but they sure never had a problem dropping all the artsy rubbish which was totally and unbelievably unnecessary instead of building pain, dread and suffering. I swear to god, the continual showing of the tree was about to drive me mad! The film had no issues with showing alot of Arthouse CGI crap, nor did it have problems using loud noises to illicit a response from the crowd... things that in many ways hurt it in my eyes. You see, the original Hideo Nakata Ring had so much dread and a foreboding sense of doom by the end you almost felt like crawling in a well yourself, but this version seems to come and go in how it approaches the subject. Naomi Watts sense of death crawling to her seems almost lost in many scenes, much as if she turns it off and on by command, or quite frankly didn't care. Brian Cox's character also suffers much in the American version because unlike his counterpart in the Nippon version you never really get an idea of just why Samara/Sadako is such a monster and why she had to be dealt with... he was truly disturbed and hiding demons, the DreamWorks version makes him too vague to matter and its a shame. Noah is by far the most maligned character of all, and is totally stripped of all his psychic ability and made a non factor and totally uninteresting, whereas Ryuji was mysterious and played an important part. Thankfully Daveigh Chase does a wonderful job recreating Sadako for the American audience, she is far and away one of the films true saving graces. Onto the production. Not too bad, but more emphsis was placed on how the people and film looked than the content. The cursed videotape itself was a joke as well compared to the original, as it looked like a second rate MTV video some Mallcore band would produce. The original had almost a `snuff' quality and captured all the rage and mysterious hatred Sadako had for humanity and due to its low production and dark feel was very, very creepy unlike the glossy, overproduced and sorely overdone DreamWorks one. Perhaps DreamWorks didn't give the audience, afterall it was laid out like connect the dots and was so pronounced that it lost all the effectiveness of its Asian counterpart. I did however like the ending better than the `Sarah Conner' ending of the original, but even so it did little to make up for the mishmash that occurred to get you to that point. Samaras inevitable (and greatly looked forward to by me) emergence was also very nice, as was the added addition of her room and the horse going mad. The film also seemed to borrow lightly from another Nakata film, the magnificent Dark Water which is not a bad thing, but just another shot at the lack of originality in American filmmaking and how instead of real minds like Nakata giving us real horror we get stuck with second rate trash like Scream and Wes  Craven productions. All in all I give it a 5.5 out of 10, if you can seek out the original as it is far superior in almost every way.",Null,0,0,28 October 2002
The Ring," Not terrible, but the original was much scarier...
","WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADWell, after putting it off all week I finally got around to seeing the RING and I must say, they did far better than I thought, but still managed to make the film laughably mediocre compared to the original.

Hopefully though, the outright theft of great ideas from Japan like this will light a fire under what is a pathetic and dead genre in the US, and maybe move us towards films that care more about fright than selling merchandise or hocking the latest Compilation album of Eminem and Slipnot...",Null,0,0,27 October 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," An amazing film, proof that even Spielberg can make a good one...
","Perhaps due to its overdone comic book feel, and Harrison Fords superb depiction of Dr. Jones I have to say Steven Spielberg actually SUCCEEDED on this one. Known for his overdone sentimental drivel, Spielberg actually harnesses his weaknesses as a film maker and limitations and made a damn near perfect film for its kind. Sure it has alot of the typical trappings of his movies (gosh darned evil Nazis in Spielberg flick, who would have guessed???)but you cant deny its a fun romp, and the subject matter is far more fun than the propaganda laced agenda he usually provides. Costuming and scenery is superb as well...",10,0,0,9 November 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," I think I now do 'Get it'... it really is garbage.
","You know, as a kid my fondest memories revolve around films I had the pleasure (or displeasure) of seeing on home video. My dad would never take us to see films in the theatre so of course I had to wait for home video of E.T., but in all that time considering the way he was merchandised I wondered at even a young age: is this actually a good movie or a ploy to sell Reeces pieces? Well, I can honestly say that the first time I finally saw the film I was more than a bit confused... just what was so special about it? Consider, E.T. is probably the single most ignorant looking creature ever seen in a film. The film went overboard in the way it portrayed The relationship with the alien, almost in a homoerotic way... it seemed that they were just TOO close, but hey I guess I'm being a cynic. Now this masterpiece of fluff has been released, and what's different? Not much, unfortunately... Spielberg showed just what kind of a director he is by butchering his own original work, but after some of the pathetic films he has helmed I suppose he could care less just as long as the money comes rolling in. And roll in it will, this film really is nothing more than a vehicle to sell endorsements and toys, it has little redeeming value other than the fact that it might keep your 2 year old at bay for at least the duration, and that it makes ol' Steven more cash to throw around. I really hope he leaves the Indiana Jones films alone once they hit DVD, but digress... he will probably squeeze them dry of life as well. In closing I would just like to say that this film is terrible, it lacks in story, goes overboard in its melodrama to the point of nausea, and most importantly it actually CHEATS the viewer by just bringing the alien back to life out NOWHERE thus defeating the only really good thing in film: his death. If you want to see masterful directing go find some Akira Kurosawa, Hiyao Miyazaki or George Romero because unlike Spielberg they know how to tell a beautiful story without killing the human element or ruining the premise via over commercialization. Truly overrated...",2,12,27,28 March 2002
Unbreakable," Amazing that so few can see the brilliance in this film...
","This film is a slow burning candle, yet it burns out of control once it reaches climax and if you actually take in what it offers leaves a refreshing and provoking image in your mind after it finishes. Amazingly well paced, intelligently written and an original take on a genre that rarely is given much thought... superheroes! A much better film than the above average yet overated Sixth Sense,  M. Night Shyamalan outdid himself by making Bruce Willis a serious element as opposed to the stereotypical wise cracking oaf he usually plays in every film. Willis was actually ACTING! Sam Jackson was also excellent here, proving once again he is more than up for the task if the right movie comes along  and was extremely effective in his side of the yin yang equation. Of course the film takes itself very serious, but why shouldnt it? Far too many films now rely on jokes, cliche archetypes and overdone commercialization so its refreshing to see a film that was based on solid storytelling for those who actually had the aptitude to follow it. It does go a bit too artsy in some scenes (though not as overdone as in the american adaptation of 'Ring'), but even so Shy pulls it off without making a mockery of its dignity. Overall a magnificent film, too bad many of the people who see it just either dont understand it or lack the ability to...",10,0,1,19 December 2002
We Were Soldiers," I cant believe so many people can bash this movie...
","If Spielberg had made it, its more than guaranteed to have been praised and heaped with adoration... but I digress. Its not Pretty. Its a nasty, painful and grotesque look at war and it DOES has an underlying moral lesson no matter how blind some may be to it. But isnt that what films like this are all about? Why cant people accept it for what it is, and not a overglorified Tom hanks vehicle or overhyped garbage like Platoon?  Gibson has starred in quite a few incredible films, and despite it not being on the same level as Braveheart I cant see how it can be compared to it. I do know however that it left a lasting impact on me, even more so since I viewed it with two Vets who could hardly speak after it was over...  a Very moving film indeed.",10,3,7,9 November 2002
Cast Away," Melodramatic bunk... This film was a waste of time and money...
","As usual Tom Hanks is cast in a film that merits little or no acting skill and this film is no exception. If you thought he overacted in his previous films you aint seen nothing yet! This film by comparison makes Bosom Buddies actually seem good with its predictable plot turns and sappy dramatics. If you want to see a really good film in the vein of this dissapointment, rent Hell in the Pacific(1968) with Lee Marvin and the incomparable Toshiro Mifune Or Papillon (1973) starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Both of these films excel where this flick falls short (in particular they actually have good actors in them...)and neither has to use a mega budget to compensate for rushed cinematics and cliche plot. If you like Hanks and his overated acting style then by all means see this movie, you WONT be dissapointed. But on the other hand if you prefer movies of substance stay FAR AWAY from CAST AWAY.",1,7,22,25 December 2000
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A Unworthy and less than stellar 'comedy'... Not The REAL Terminator.
","You know in the last 10 years American film making has suffered horribly in the way that it plays up movie clichés, and things that are perceived as comic relief, this film serves as a prime example of how to take a no brainer and mock what you are actually trying to accomplish. The first problem comes in that Arnold is no longer just a caricature of himself in the publics minds, but now he's a caricature of that caricature in the movie itself if that makes any sense. Having him spout off one liners just for the sake of one liners is really sad, and unlike the typical 'comic relief' that pollutes films now days its was way overdone in the first hour or so almost to the point I was feeling embarrassed as a fan of the series. It was almost like they were trying to make you forget they actually had a real struggle in the movie and that the t-850 was there to be a joke, hell if that was the case why didn't they just hire Rob Schneider as the threat? LISTEN UP HOLLYWOOD some of us LOVE these kinds of films, why 'fix' what's not broken??? Comic relief is fine if used right, but as this film goes it was poorly wrote and badly placed. The TX or Terminatrix was pretty lame as well, but much of that had to do with the way she was shot, and not just how bad her acting was... simply put she did not come across as a cold blooded killer like Arnie or Robert Patrick did. The idea of exploiting her femininity to murder is one thing, but they way it was handled is another as the 'Victoria's secret' scene was made for 10 year olds it would seem. Why the hell would a damn near invincible 'pull over' for a cop anyway? That really made sense... To have a unproven like Jonathan Mostow direct in Cameron's leave is just ridiculous, the guys a damned hack pure and simple if he can ruin something so good, especially trimming the film down under 2 hours like a good 'commercial' director. For all the negativity though I will say it had SOME redeeming things going for it, the first of which is Nick Stahl. Stahl was TREMENDOUS in the movie and in many ways the glue that held it together for the first hour, unlike the terrible actor (Edward Furlong) that portrayed him in T2, he had depth and appeal. The last 30 mins are pretty good (even if the Terminator battle was eh...) and the ending gave me chills... Too bad this film was so badly soiled by its directors hand and the poor script, it could have been great 5/10 (Mainly due to Stahl's outstanding performance)",5,0,0,6 July 2003
Schindler's List," Overated and weak retelling of a tired theme...
","I admit, I have never been a big fan of Steven Spielberg. I must also admit however that I have a great deal of respect for his charming and subsequent brainwashing of Hollywood, and how easily he has made himself a brand name that always commands respect despite having made some of Hollywood's most overrated and tired films. With Schindler's List he truly created some powerful images, thought provoking and inciting in how they make you react...BUT... That's about where it ends. The talent of Steven lies in his ability to pull the strings of an audience, and in placing his propaganda so effectively, yet in this film with such a weak cast (other than Ralph Fiennes who was very effective as opposed to the generally weak and painful to watch Liam Neeson) and tired subject he breaks no new ground. Not to say it did not have its beautiful scenes, the executions and murders were poignant and well done, but lost much of their effect being coupled with so much overdone melodrama and sap. Its about time Hollywood wakes up, we need new directors who are bold yet sensible enough to know that there is no such thing as too far, but are intelligent enough to make a film that can rely on something other than pure shock, and that sometimes just a little is not enough and this is perfect evidence of that point. This film would have been excellent had a master such as Stanley Kubrick made it, but as it stands Schindlers List garners a 2 out of 10 in my eyes and is one of Spielberg's better films, but if nothing else its far superior to ET and the wretched Saving Private Ryan.",1,127,283,9 November 2002
The Matrix," Overblown, Overrated and Overdrawn...
","perhaps being the last soul on earth to see this film, I honestly cant say I went into it expecting much, and being as much I cant say i'm dissapointed. For all the Brouhaha surrounding this special effects marvel, I fail to see what in fact was so good about it. It was almost all effects, almost to the point of Nausea, something that Keaunu did little to help. His typical 'Dewd' performance was laughable at best, bordering on the wretched and far from notable. Fishburne was great as usual, but he couldnt save his piece of trash and the other actors were like a B movie ensemble. Maybe the next film will move up a notch and actually be watchable.",1,13,32,4 September 2000
Princess Mononoke," One of the three best anime movies ever!!
","I was worried going into the theatre knowing that the film I was about to see was an english dubbed feature. And knowing that most dubbed anime is not half as true to the original japanese dialogue. (with the exeption of Ranma 1/2 and Dominion Tank Police) The more recent Miyazaki releases have been considerably butchered. How should I say it....this movie encompassed all of the emotion, and sublime beauty of Nausicaa and Tonari no Totoro!! The scenery is lush with detail. The animation is astounding. And the acting was suprisingly good. If you're worried about seeing an english dubbed anime and are waiting for the dvd, please see this on the big screen before it's too late! Definately on par with the two best anime films out there! Grave of the Fireflies and the Wings of Honimese!",10,0,1,6 December 1999
