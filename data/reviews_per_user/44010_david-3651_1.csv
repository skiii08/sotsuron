"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Humorous retelling of film Running [1979]
","This was a great film and had me and the rest of the audience in stitches. Well worth seeing and for those that have seen Michael Douglas in the Running [1979] the tale will be somewhat familiar.Simon Pegg delivers the comedic moments superbly (doesn't he always?) and yet also convincingly parts a warm touch to, well, those warm touching moments in the film that he shares with his son.Harish Patel deserves a very honourable mention as Pegg's landlord-cum-mentor-cum-trainer. The only problem with the film was that all the way through I was waiting on Nick Frost to make at least a cameo appearance - talking of which the David Walliams scene will bring a smile to those Little Britaners out there.Great film.",8,59,77,6 September 2007
