Saturday Night Fever," Surprisingly deep toe-tapping drama
","I thought that Saturday Night Fever was an OK film. It's not one of the best ever despite its iconic moments and having John Travolta perfect;y cast in the role as Tony Manero. I admired the films guts, that it didn't turn into some fluffy rom-com, like Flashdance and it could've quite easily followed that formulaic route. Instead we're given a protagonist who a lot of the time isn't at all likable with his womanising and compassionate-less state. The film gives an in-depth view into his dysfunctional family life. Tony Manero is a well thought out and realised character. Unfortunately little characterisation is given to his friends, although they mostly appear the same as him.Saturday Night Fever really scores points in its atmosphere though. Once we enter the 2001 Odyssey the atmosphere is quite infectious with its vibrant flashing lights and sometimes hypnotic camera movements. I thought that the film would be too dance-heavy and whilst some of the dancing did go on for too long it was actually quite a joy to watch. It's easy to see why John Travalto's mesmerising dance solo has gone on to become iconic.However, I did feel that the film took a disliking to women due to male dominance. Tony's love interest isn't explored in enough depth and the film has some serious pacing issues. Sometimes it loses its focus by getting too into a sub-plot that doesn't require that much attention. I think that the film should've primarily focused on winning the dance trophy, but once the final came I didn't feel excited like I did for the Nina's opening night in Black Swan, and I should've done! The final 15-20 minutes are quite gripping though and very upsetting. The film reaches even grittier territory that I found hard-hitting. I admire it for that. And although in the end it did reach some sort of cosy ending, I thought it was believable and quite touching. Saturday Night Fever features a fantastic soundtrack, brilliant directing and excellent characterisation on Tony Manero, but in the end it lacks focus and drags in places. I didn't enjoy it any where near as much as a Chilean film called 'Tony Manero' which grippingly follows a Chilean man who has a disturbing obsession with Saturday Night Fever. I'd recommend seeing that under-rated gem instead.",6,1,2,6 August 2012
Black Swan," Probably THE greatest film I have ever seen
","I was scared that I might've been getting a little too hyped up for this and my expectations would be set too high and I'd end up being disappointed with it, feeling like it was over rated rubbish. But, 'Black Swan' didn't just meet my high expectations, but exceeded them.I don't know where to begin with this absolute masterpiece (or marsterpiece as my art teacher would say) it is simply extraordinary. Let's start with the obvious. The performances. Natalie Portman deserves every single award she's nominated for. Not only did she dance like a professional but she managed to still emphasise with her character whilst still remembering her moves. That requires some serious skill! Portman should get that Oscar! Barbara Hershey was equally as mind blowing as the over protected, slightly (well, maybe a little more than slightly) loopy mother. Barbara was terrifying! She was like Carrie's mum (in the scary sense, not in the disturbing religious sense) and I hope she wins something as well. The womanising teacher was great, as was the rival ballet woman. Every performance (like in 'The King's Speech) was fantastic! 'Black Swan' is a marsterclarse in directing (that's masterclass) right from the editing to the camera shots it was perfect. The final scene was shot so intensely that my pulse was racing, but we'll get to that in a minute. I've never seen a Darren Arfronskey film before but by gum I will do now! Every scare counts and is effective. Nina's slow decomposition into hell is perfectly paced.The screenplay is solid and captivating. Letting us experience every bit of horror are mentally unstable person can experience. I can't remember actually watching a film before and just being sucked into the world of the film. It felt like I was actually there and when it was over I felt so disorientated and dizzy (no it's not because I'm middle aged) I was just absolutely astounded by what i just witnessed. The film can be so well analysed, it is so clever it's unbelievable. Kids should be analysing this at school! Not 'Death Of A Salesman' Why do people keep commenting on 'there's too much ballet'? Yeah there is but it's completely purposeful to the film! They didn't just think 'Oh, let's bung some ballet there for the intellectual's' it's meaningful and I actually enjoyed it! (and I'm not gay!) The last half hour or so was bloody intense! It was like all she had been waiting for was building up and suddenly released it was beautiful, stunning! No words can describe the ending! It is just heart pounding. I was left speechless, the first words that came out of my mouth were 'Oh my god!' Yeah, it's literally mind blowing.I could write an essay on how incredible 'Black Swan' is but it still wouldn't justify it. It is possibly the greatest film I've ever seen. At the end of the film Nina says 'It was perfect' and I couldn't agree more.",10,1,4,20 March 2011
Changeling," Trout-Fish
","'Changeling' didn't blow me away like it promised to, instead it gave me an above-satisfactory true life drama which delivered some pleasant cinematography, capable directing and so-so writing.Why was the writing so-so? Well, I honestly believe that 'Changeling' focused too much on giving the audience an historical account rather than an emotional one. We were given a depiction of a woman's life, loves son, loses son, gets a son that isn't hers, protests about it, goes in mental hospital, goes out. With a sub serial killer story that was an added bonus. Instead I think that 'Changeling' would've benefited from focusing on the relationship with her son which we didn't get that much of. It's very early on in the film where her son disappears so we don't get that emotional characterisation between Jolie and her son which would've added much more emotion to the story.Also, their should've been longer of Angelina coping with her loss so that the audience could feel a little more excited when the police assure that they've found her son. Added to this the screenplay would've been stronger if we could see this rock relationship between Angelina and her fake son instead of giving us some historical factual account. Sure you can have her life in the mental hospital and the killer sub-plot but these shouldn't take over the main theme of the film which is love, loss and corruption.However, what the film did do well was to give some gripping emotional-driven scenes. 'Changeling' was engaging but far from perfection. Agelina Jolie's performance was extremely over-rated, I couldn't take her seriously with her massive trout-like lips she must've used at least two lip sticks for one lip! Either that or she used one the size of a barrel. Her silly pudding hat was annoying as well, but as for her performance it was hammy. I lost count the amount of times she said 'my son' (which is why I've used that line many times in this review ;).In the end 'Changeling' isn't a bad film, in fact it's a very good film but it could've been improved upon, say if Lars Von Trier directed and Helena Bonham Carter replaced Angelina Jolie and Darren Aronofsky wrote it but hey. You can't have everything.",8,1,3,29 June 2011
Requiem for a Dream," We've got a winner!
","Like 'Black Swan', another compelling masterpiece by Darren, 'Requiem For A Dream' is a descent into madness. Only this is even more depressing, as the characters begin on a high (no pun intended) with there dreams seemingly close to their grasp and feeling great but end up plummeting down to the bottom thanks to addiction, with their dreams coming right down with them. 'Requiem For A Dream' is a masterpiece by Darren Aronofsky, it combines everything often overlooked by other film-makers (visuals, sound etc.) to make an unforgettable film that punches you right in the stomach and eventually pushes through right after the credits roll.So what makes 'Requiem For A Dream' so great? Well, firstly, it comes down to Darren's flawless direction. Just like 'Black Swan' you feel as if you are going on a harrowing journey with the characters. Instead of just limply watching them, you feel almost as you're there with them. It is startlingly involving. Some of the visuals are very intense, the last half hour is dizzying in its intensity thanks to Darren's manic quick-cutting and Clint Mansell's incredible score. Darren also shows that he has balls by taking risks, the scene in which Ellen Burstyn goes crazy is incredibly well done and was quite risky in the way it was executed. Some might say the scene seemed daft or even quite funny, which is probably intentional, drugs may seem fun at first but they soon consume you like the fridge. Darren also makes clever use of split-screen which brings you even closer to the characters mental-state.Sound is a medium film-makers often over look, whether it be diegetic or not, Darren uses both to absorbing effect. Clint's score is a staggering masterpiece in itself, it's haunting and always gives me chills (though it doesn't when they use it on 'Britains Got Talent'). In fact, music is almost always played over each scene which adds to the hypnotic nature of the film. Sometimes the music will change quite suddenly to give the effect of disorientation, making us as an audience dizzy and slightly insane (I am already). Darren uses diegetic sounds inventively as well, by often using them as a sting over quick cuts, like when the camera slowly zooms in to Ellen Burstyn and randomly cuts quickly off to her popping pills. Darren's inventive style really adds to the intensity of the film. It is edited perfection.Darren also shows off his writing skills along with the other man who wrote the novel. It perfectly demonstrates each characters descent into complete and utter madness to the point where the emotional barrel is over-flowing. The final scene made me nearly well-up and leaves you in complete awe as the credits roll up. Each character is written in detail as well, it's in-depth which is also why the whole film is so compelling and absorbing.Ellen Burstyn's performance is also incredible. She deserved that Oscar which Julia Roberts (looks like Coops :) robbed off Ellen. What i don't like about the Oscars is the way they don't go on performance but on nationality or if you've won one already. I'm guessing because Ellen had already won one, they weren't giving her another. I'm sorry but Ellen completely deserved it, her performance is so compelling and realistic. It's obvious that she put a lot of work into her character. In fact everyone puts on an excellent performance which is always great to see.Some people complain that 'Requiem For A Dream' is far too depressing and leaves you feeling 'bad'. I can guess that most of these people are American wanting a Hollywood happy ending. The sad truth is there is no happy ending to drug addiction, which is why 'Requiem For A Dream' is frighteningly honest and truthful. Would it really be realistic if everyone recovered and all there dreams came true? No. If you want to stop, don't start. Although it has an 18 certificate for it's graphic use of drug-taking, shocking images, and sexually explicit images, I honestly think this film should be a 12. Those images are deliberately put there to shock people into not taking drugs, all minors should see this film.I always know if a film is good if I get chills at the end and I just awingly stare as the credits roll. I defy anyone to come out of 'Requiem For A Dream' without feeling any emotion at all. 'Requiem For A Dream' is simply a rare masterpiece. It's directing is flawless, with awe-inspiring music and visuals. It's painfully honest and truthful and a harrowing masterpiece. Films like this don't come around very often so make the most of it. See it now!",10,0,0,19 August 2011
Skyfall," Bond is shaken and stirred!
","I'm unashamed to admit that I have never seen a Bond film in my life. They've just never appealed to me due to the sexism, clichés and tired old conventions. However, what caused me to go and see Skyfall 50 years too late I hear you ask? Well, the reviews were shining and I heard that it's almost a rebirth of the tired old Bond and my favourite critic Chris Tookey also approved the film with a perfect 10/10 so I just had to see it. Whilst it's still no masterpiece, it's sheer entertainment of the highest quality.Now, just because I've never seen a Bond movie before doesn't mean that I'm ignorant to all the conventions. There's always a Bond girl for example who gets unfairly oogled over, he always asks for a Martini shaken and not stirred and a bad guy often ends up surviving at the end. What Skyfall does beautifully, right from the start is play with these conventions. Maybe not as inventively or as intelligently as say The Cabin in the Woods, but it's great to know that it realises these conventions are tired and people are getting fed up. The opening would be a real shocker, if it wasn't for the marketing campaign's which spoil it, nevertheless James Bond getting shot and failing is certainly something that should take you off-guard.Skyfall sends you straight into the action. There's an exhilarating opening, shot beautifully by Sam Mendes who did that incredible film called American Beauty. It's a drawn out chase sequence in Turkey and is marvellous fun to watch and also quite tense at times, especially at the finale of the scene where M famously says, 'Take the bloody shot!' It's also great to see M have a major role. Judi Dench is a wonderful actress and plays the hard-nosed and often humorous M perfectly. It was also refreshing to see M being the target of the villain's vendetta rather than Bond or M16 itself.The film then takes Bond on a tour around several exotic locations where some cliché's are played out. My Mum dismissed the film by calling the action 'corny' (hate that word) and just having a hatred towards the Bond genre itself (Bondaphobia) but what she failed to see is that the action is no 'cornier' than any other action film, it's just entertainment and fun! There's a string of exciting and tense action sequences when Bond travels the world, and it was also surprisingly beautifully shot. However, I would argue that it did get a tad drawn out, especially in the Casino place where Bond has a long conversation with a Bond girl which adds very little to the film.It's when the villain that's introduced that things become very interesting. Javier Bardem stole the show in my eyes. He played the role with a creepiness almost matching the Joker. His presence was carried throughout and he was also a very well written character, who's always one step ahead of Bond. It's just a shame that Silva wasn't introduced earlier on because I would've loved a Dark Knight-esque battle of wits between them throughout the film! I'd also like to add that Silva's entrance was absolutely brilliant with one long drawn out shot of him walking and telling a compelling tale. It really conveys his power and dominance over Bond. I loved him (not in a gay way).Things only get better when the action returns to London and it does become a battle of wits between Bond and Silva. There's an incredibly chilling scene with Silva talking to M in his isolated cell and when he inevitably gets out there's a thrilling and action-packed chase to match any spectacular chase scene! The action and writing excels right up until the explosive finale in Scotland, where things become even more fun and joyous, all adding to a climatic and emotional ending, leaving any audience member fully satisfied! Another thing I loved about Skyfall was its use of humour. I laughed quite a bit, especially at the banter between Bond and M as it's obvious they secretly love each other! I've heard comparisons being made between Skyfall and The Dark Knight and whilst there are echoes, I'm afraid that this is definitely not as good as The Dark Knight! The Dark Knight has a much deeper and emotional story, with greater and more intense action sequences and characters. But if we compared every film to The Dark Knight we wouldn't be very happy! As Skyfall stands it's an incredibly entertaining and intelligent action film which left me fully satisfied. I had a lot of fun and think (if you're open minded) you might too!",9,1,8,13 December 2012
United 93," Took a nose dive like the plane
","'United 93' was not as great as it could and should've been. It had several problems which most people would call weaknesses but also some strengths that make it worth watching. One of the weaknesses in my eyes was the extremely hand-held documentary feel of the film. Shaky cam is great now and again but when it starts to consume the whole film with no control what so ever it starts to become tiresome. Supposedly it was supposed to show the whole panic and lack of control of the whole situation but it needed to be much more controlled like in 'Black Swan' or 'The Wrestler'.Another weak point was the way the first three quarters were so slow. We don't really care or understand about these plane dots that keep disappearing and several calls from planes saying that they've been hijacked. It became very repetitive and the plane that the whole film is about (93, my age) became over-shadowed until the final scenes. In my opinion the film would've been stronger if it was focused almost completely on 93 being hijacked.I also didn't like the lack of plot. Some may argue that the plot simply was about the 9/11 attacks which is fine, but there were no real characters who we could care about. There seemed to be very little characterisation going on which means the story stalled and couldn't get passed a certain road block. A story could've perhaps been made up, maybe not to the extent of 'Titanc' but it might've been better if it focused on one or two particular people or families so that the plot could be driven forward a bit more.But, if we put aside all my perhaps unreasonable comments, they're are some good aspects about the film. It did feel realistic which is a sort of must in a real-life account type film. It felt like you could imagine this happening which was good. It was also good how they used unknown actors as this added also to the realism of it all. The final 20 minutes or so are also really good, when the plane actually gets hijacked and the passengers fight back it's thrilling and intense and it should've been like this throughout instead of focussing on the traffic-control peeps.'United 93' is worth seeing if you get passed the slow beginning. It's final act is what the film is about with great and inspiring actions by the passengers. It's ending is also really good and truthful. Perhaps, if you remember the 9/11 attacks you might appreciate it more, but I was a mere nipper.",5,0,2,15 September 2011
A Star Is Born," A miracle birth
","A Star is Born
A miracle birthStars: Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, Sam ElliotCooper's A Star Is Born had everything going against it when it was announced. Hollywood is renowned for its lack of originality but remaking a film for a third time is garishly lazy, even for them! It began with Janet Gaynor in 1937, then Judy Garland had a go in 1954 before passing the song-and-dance baton onto Barbra Streisand in 1976. I mean, how many times can a star really be born? Well, apparently the answer is at least four times as our Lady Gaga is now having a go playing the reluctant starlet rising to fame. Gaga wouldn't have been an obvious choice for a leading lady after her horrendously wooden stint in American Horror Story which bizarrely earned her a Golden Globe. Type-cast pretty-boy, Bradley Cooper also wouldn't spring to mind as the perfect leading man, let alone as writer and director. The whole project sounded doomed from the beginning.However, ladies and gents, take those cynical hats off because by some miracle turn, Bradley Cooper's version of A Star is Born isn't just good, it's pretty much great on all levels. Following in the footsteps of the 70's Barbra Streisand version, Cooper unsurprisingly decides to focus on the music industry rather than the movies. This means that both leads find themselves outside of their comfort zones as Cooper must pretend to be a world-class singer and Gaga has to do a Cher and become both a phenomenal singer and actress at the same time. Somehow, they both manage to pull it off. Bradley Cooper is more known for his comedy roles in The Hangover and the films of Academy favourite, David O Russell (The Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle etc.) and has given no indication of just how far he can stretch his acting abilities. Here, he completely transforms himself into Jack, the raging alcoholic with a troubled past and a penchant for popstars. I'd certainly be very surprised if he doesn't earn an Oscar nomination for his performance which at times feels painfully all too real. Gaga also impresses as Ally, although this is a role which doesn't particularly stretch her as an actress. A popstar playing a popstar rising to fame wasn't exactly going to be difficult for her, at one point she mentions being signed with Interscope Records (her actual record label) and you wonder if she's really acting at all. She really does mesmerise in the singing department, however, and the scenes involving heated arguments feel frighteningly genuine.The plot itself sticks quite faithfully to all the other Star is Born's. Alcoholic superstar falls for talented nobody and transforms her into a superstar whilst he spirals into a deadly hole of addiction, whilst almost derailing her career. It's a very simple story and the film does feel quite overlong. The first half is the strongest and paciest section. After about and hour or so, the film does start to feel a little repetitive and I was left wondering where else it was going to go. What packs a real punch though is the ending. Of course, it won't come as any surprise for those who have seen any of the other versions of the story, but here it's no less powerful and executed pretty much to perfection.Cooper's directing is also very arresting. There's a very raw and real feel to whole film which grounds the film in a reality rarely seen in Hollywood blockbusters. The camerawork is often handheld and intimate so that we always feel close to the characters and their lives. Whilst I wouldn't quite say that the film is an instant classic like some critics, A Star is Born is well worth your time. If not least for the powerful ending which sees both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga at the very top of their respective games.",9,2,6,8 October 2018
Gravity," Two people bob about in space
","What Gravity does extremely well at is transporting the viewer into space. The floaty camera-work is absolutely brilliant and during the action it's sometimes just damn stunning! Action films could learn a lot from Gravity, as a lot of this film is done in singular long takes which is much more tense and involving to watch than frantic quick cut editing which makes it impossible to see what's going on. I also enjoyed the POV shots which literally put the viewer in Sandra's shoes (or space boots?) and create some fantastic disorientation. The visuals are also consistently amazing. It's hard to believe that basically everything is CGI because it all looks so very real. Even Gravity's biggest critics have to at least appreciate the amount of work that has gone on in the visual department.However, I doubt that Gravity's stint in IMDb's top 250 will last. Gravity is very much a cinema film. It's a film that has to be experienced on a big screen and in 3D to get everything out of it. At home, on your 20' black and white portable TV-video combo it won't look so impressive. In fact, a lot of people will find it quite boring to be quite frank. The pacing in Gravity is very slow at times, which I didn't mind, but it could become a chore with multiple viewings. My guess is that the novelty will quickly wear off when it hits our DVD shelves. Part of the excitement of Gravity is not knowing what's going to come next! I was wondering how they were going to make a feature length film from two people bobbing about in space, but they managed it and for the first time it's great! However, when you strip down Gravity, plot-wise, you'll find that there's not too much going on.The film is all about survival and Sandra puts on an excellent performance as Ryan Stone. The idea of being lost in space is a pretty terrifying one and it's perfectly executed here. Unfortunately, George isn't quite so good. He seems more like a spare part and is only there to look good. Although to be fair, his character isn't too well written. He just seems like some babbling idiot who's not fazed by anything, which is difficult to believe. Gravity is mostly a one-woman show though and Sandra makes Ryan a compelling character. There are some surprisingly emotional scenes as well which are just as impressive as the big set-pieces.Gravity has fallen into the hype machine a little bit. I don't think it's the best film of the year. It's more like a ride that'll quickly ware thin with multiple viewings. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and I thought that the 3D was used really well, but I wouldn't be in a hurry to see it again. I also didn't find it as intense as others did. I think Black Swan and last year's The Dark Knight Rises are far more intense pieces. Gravity is very suspenseful though and masterfully shot. It's well worth seeing, but be sure to make your first time the best. Seek out the biggest screen you can, put on your 3D glasses and let the film sweep you away. It might not be the best space film ever made, but it's a very entertaining and sometimes incredibly stunning piece of work.",8,1,3,28 November 2013
Train to Busan," Zombies on a train
","Zombie films have been hitting our screens since the dawn of time. Well, it certainly feels like they have anyway. Popularised by George A Romero's terrific Dead trilogy, zombie films have since been rearing their heads like hordes of the undead themselves. Whilst they can be a lot of fun, more often than not, they can also be clichÃ© ridden and trashy. We have had some quite enjoyable zombie films recently such as, Cockneys Vs Zombies and The Horde but we haven't really had a properly great zombie movie since 2004's Shaun of the Dead. Train to Busan changes that.I saw Train to Busan on a whim. I'm travelling in Singapore and had a few free days so I thought that I'd check what's on the cinemas here. Train to Busan caught my eye but I had never heard of it, however I saw that it was Korean and that it had zombies in it, so I was sold! To my surprise, I came out of the cinema having just viewed easily the best zombie film in a decade. Korean films have hardly ever let me down and Busan is no exception.As there's very little coverage of this film on the Internet, I'd better give a rough plot outline. It basically follows a selfish father who is cold and neglectful towards his cute young daughter. For her birthday, she wants to travel to Busan to see her mother so he reluctantly takes her on the train to Busan (creative title) however, a rather inconvenient zombie outbreak occurs as they board the train. The rest of the film is a claustrophobic and thrilling fight for survival as the survivors desperately try everything in their measure to get to Busan on a undead-infested train.What makes this film so great is the characters. Most horror films (particularly ones with zombies in) sprinkle a load of disposable characters in who all die in a predictable order. We don't often particularly care when they die, in fact we're more likely to relish the gory death shown in all its bloody gory. In contrast, Train to Busan focuses in on a line of memorable characters who we actually care about and want to see survive. They're developed in such a way that when someone cruelly perishes, we feel a great sense of loss and emotion. This is where the film's strength lies. What's also interesting is that they're not all stereotypes either. The protagonist isn't your typical hero, he's a character who is grossly selfish and unlikable at the start, but he subtlety develops into someone you begin to care about and admire.The film starts off as a good little zombie thriller. There's a sense of realism to the whole situation as we're made to watch the panic unfold on the train in an effective way. There's also a nice comic touch to the whole thing with some witty dialogue so it never takes itself too seriously. It also somehow never gets boring even though the film is essentially two hours set on a train, which is no easy task. There's always tension and a sense of peril. You get the feeling that anything could happen to these characters at any given moment. Once the film reaches the mid-way point though it stops being good and starts becoming great.Things get going fairly quickly so the characters develop through the action, making the film all the more gripping as it goes on. It's an unpredictable ride with lots of thrilling set- pieces to keep you on edge. The final half hour is essentially non-stop action and it becomes exhausting to watch without ever feeling too ridiculous. What really impressed me though was the emotional charge in the second half. There are a few scenes which had me welling up with tears, which I wasn't expecting. I just got so absorbed in the characters and their intense situation. The use of music and editing is also hugely effective in pulling at your heartstrings.There's really very little which Train to Busan does wrong. If I were to nitpick, I'd say that I would've liked more gore. Zombie films always give a good excuse to give us an array of fun, gory effects but this film is surprisingly restrained. There's a lot of hand-to-hand combat and nothing else creative. However, this does sort of add to the realism of the situation as you're not going to find many axes or chainsaws on a train. It's still not as bloodless as World War Z.I can't urge you enough to watch Train to Busan, especially if you're a fan of Korean cinema. It doesn't just offer plenty of nail-biting thrills and impressive special effects, It offers emotion and splendid characters whom you can properly invest in. It's a powerful film which wears its heart on its sleeve and contains more character development in two hours than The Walking Dead has in six seasons. Once the film was over I became overcome with emotion. I felt like I could just break down and cry at what I had just watched. This is so much more than a zombie flick, at its heart it's a devastating drama about family and the importance of human kindness. I loved it.",9,11,24,21 September 2016
Citizen Kane," Citizen Krap
","This is the greatest film of all time. Well god help films. If all films were like this, I can tell you now that I would have no interest in them what so ever. 'Citizen Kane' is out of print, well at least it should've been.I'm not going to lie, I did enjoy the first 30 minutes, the first 10 which explained Kane's life in a nutshell held up very well even for today's standards. It seemed fast, it seemed interesting and i seriously thought that this could be a really great film! Then we were introduced to Kane the child, a bit of back-story (well actually a lot of back-story) and then we got to Kane being a newspaper mogul, starting out and it was about here that I thought, this must only have half an hour left. It actually had an hour and a half left, I had been watching it for 30 minutes. I stuck with it and I don't think I've ever had a night that long in my life! It's only a 2 hour film but it felt like it was four, and I'm really not exaggerating here! It was so boring! I think I nearly dropped off in some moments, I don't really care about this man who had success and then lost it all because I've seen it all before but in a much more interesting way! I know this film is as old as the hills but we're in the 21st century now, and so I have to compare to the standard of films we get now! I watched 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' the same day as this, a film that's almost 3 hours long and I had no problem with the length because it didn't feel that long at all. In the same way it tells of a man's life, but it's interesting! So the boredom factor is my biggest problem with this. The story was nothing I've not seen before as I said. But, I suppose the directing was impressive. Particularly in the opening 10 minutes and in some scenes I noticed some eccentric camera moves for the 1940's. but on the whole, the camera was as static as most film noir.This is all I have to say on this. I think it's over-rated, over-long and over-here! Maybe it has some hidden meaning, but that's wasted on me. Just because a film has flashbacks doesn't make it the greatest film ever. What the hell is rosebud anyway!",6,3,8,11 June 2011
Memento," You won't forget this one!
","I'm quite convinced that Christopher Nolan is not a man at all, but is in fact a movie-making machine. I don't believe that it's humanly possible to make films that are just so insanely clever as 'Inception' or 'Memento'. Christopher Nolan even manages to make Batman seem clever, and you know how that originally started out. I saw 'Memento' for the second time yesterday and its incredibly complex writing blew me away if not more so that the first time. I was awe-struck the first time that I watched 'Memento', not only at the screenplay, but at the directing and acting also.If a film like 'Memento' had been placed in the hands of any other director then it very easily could've turned into a confused and boring mess. Like, 'Inception' Christopher Nolan deals with complex ideas that are very rarely seen in the movie world, but he handles them with such careful control and sophistication that they end up being some of the most mind-blowing films ever! Watching 'Memento' with my parents was an experience in itself. To understand 'Memento' you need a mind that is prepared to not just watch a film, but to be a part of it. Because 'Memento' is placed in a backward order, you need to figure out and remember what's happened before a scene and try and piece the mystery together yourself.In hindsight this might seem like just a gimmick. But, 'Memento' couldn't be told any other way, as it leaves you being confused as much as Leonard. It places you in Leonard's mind so that you don't know what's happened, like Leonard doesn't know. However, to follow the mystery we have to go back to see what has happened and Christopher Nolan uses this to his advantage and is able to create an extremely clever and complex mystery with an ending to die for. However, my parents failed to realise this. They were asking questions like 'why's he still alive, he was shot a minute ago!' They just didn't get the idea of telling the story backward and the ending just left their mind in a graveyard! Luckily I didn't watch it with them the first time, so the second time was more amusing.Christopher Nolan's directing is also just as brilliant. He manages to place us into the mind of Leonard through excellent uses of narration and also completely gripping black and white sequence which is like a short film in itself. Guy Pearce is also brilliant at playing Leonard, it makes you wonder if he's got the same condition as Leonard! (He doesn't, just for the record.) Chrstopher often places us in the eyes of Leonard and so we suffer the same problems as him. 'Memento' is like an experience that leaves you mentally exhausted.'Memento' is one of the best films I have ever seen and is probably in my Top 10 list of the best films I have seen. It's beautifully written and directed and had me completely engrossed from the minute it started. It's also an excellent character piece, with people we can care about. It's thrilling, enthralling and involving. 'Memento' is the perfect thriller, told in such a way that it's difficult to forget. If you have a fantastic attention span and are prepared to really concentrate in your films then you won't be disappointed with 'Memento'.",10,1,3,24 February 2012
Green Room," Didn't make me green with sickness or envy
","Don't you hate it when you get yourself hyped up for a film and it lets you down? Green Room has everything I love in a film: A fight for survival, intensity and psychopaths. Horror fans and critics were building it up with stories about people walking out the cinema vomiting and calling it one of the most intense films ever , but I wholeheartedly disagree. Don't get me wrong Green Room is a good film but it's no where near as amazing as people are making it out to be. As an avid fan of home invasion and survive the night kind of horror, I think there are much better examples of this kind of film out there and whilst Green Room is a solid thriller it really doesn't bring anything new to the table. My biggest gripe is how forgettable the characters are. Likable characters and character development are essential for slasher films like this. If you like the characters then chances are that you'll be invested in the film. However, I didn't really care about any of these characters and they all felt pretty lifeless. Even the potentially fascinating neo-Nazi villains were wasted, with no characters really being explored. Green Room set itself up for a Eden Lake standard character-driven ride, but failed to deliver its full potential.Another thing that irritated me was the acting. Everyone seemed to be acting very odd with lines being mumbled to a barely audible level and no one really being that bothered about murderous Nazis being outside the door. I don't think this is the fault of the actors though, I get the feeling that this is the style of acting the director was going for but for me it didn't work. Even Patrick Stewart sleep-walked his way through the film failing to be the menacing kingpin he could've been. I don't think anyone's going to be winning any awards here.This all makes it sound like I hated the film, but I did actually like most of it. I liked the slow build-up of the group ending up in the scary fascist bar and how situations slowly and realistically built up to a life or death situation. When the crazy violence does begin the film never becomes boring despite being set in one location, although it's still never as intense as it could've been. It is very thought-provoking though and leaves you wondering about what you'd do in their situation. I also loved the dark grungy atmosphere which really added to the hellish situation the group are in.There are some brilliantly tense scenes, especially towards the end with a couple of nail-biting showdowns which are really well done and but I was expecting more. The way it was hyped, I thought it was going to be the same level of intensity as Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury's French horror, Inside! However, some of the film is poorly directed with low lighting, frantic camera- work and fast editing so it's often difficult to make out what's going on which takes you out of the film and makes it uninvolving. At some points I found it hard to tell which characters' had died. I also don't quite understand why people are vomiting from the violence. Whilst there are some nasty moments I never found it overly gory, but then again I am very desensitized now. I know it sounds like I hated every minute but if you take away the hype it is a good little thriller and I just want to warn over- excited people (like I was) that it isn't the ground- breaking horror film they think it's going to be. Films like You're Next and the recent 10 Cloverfield Lane are more intense and better made than this one.",7,1,9,16 May 2016
The Babadook," If it's in a word, or it's in a look, if you're after great horror, you're in luck!
","'The best horror movie in years' tends to be the key phrase to use when describing a genuinely good horror film. However, I think modern horror tends to get a bad reputation due to the amount rubbish produced. We've had endless Paranormal Activity films which seem to make big money and the appalling Human Centipede movies seem to make big noise, but these films aren't especially 'good'. Unfortunately though, they tend to overshadow the fantastic horror films we have been getting recently such as: You're Next, The Sacrament and Cheap Thrills to name a few. The Babadook can now pop itself onto that list. In fact, I'd say that it's easily the best and scariest supernatural horror film since the underrated Sinister. The Babadook still seems to get quite a lot of criticism for some reason though. To be fair, the trailers do make it look like some sort of run-of-the-mill jumpy ghost story, so perhaps audiences were disappointed when they got a film full of rich characterisation, domestic drama and psychological depth. I wasn't. The Babadook certainly isn't your typical supernatural horror film though. We're not even given a glimpse of the Babadook himself until about 50 minutes into the film, but this doesn't matter because the central themes and characters are so strong.There seems to be some debate as to whether this is a supernatural or psychological horror film. Some think that it leaves it up for the viewer to decide, but I thought that director Jennifer Kent was making it quite obvious that this was a film about a woman going mad. It's very much in the same vein of The Shining and Repulsion as our hero slowly descends into a total schizophrenic onslaught of terror. As a result, we're given a much deeper and character-driven film about grief, motherhood and madness.The heart of the film is the relationship between a mother and son. Both actors are pretty extraordinary, especially the mother played by Elsie Davis who gives an incredibly strong and shattering performance. Many have described the boy as the most annoying child to ever appear in a film, which is a pretty bold statement and one which I wouldn't necessarily disagree with! The decision to make the boy as painfully annoying as chewing a wasp is an extremely conscious one though as we're put directly into the shoes of the mother. Amelia finds her son extremely hard to love as she subconsciously blames him for the death of her husband. By the end of the film we end up feeling as crazy as Amelia!The first hour is actually a very sad one as we see Amelia become slowly isolated from people as her life becomes increasingly more hectic. No one seems to understand her grief and no one wants to know her because of Samuel (the impossibly annoying son). Therefore her descent into madness is a wonderfully realistic one. It's also quite frightening. I'm not one to get scared in horror films, I can watch The Exorcist on my own and feel no fright what so ever, however there were some scenes in The Babadook which made my hair stand on end. The last half hour basically just tries its best to scare the trouser off you and it succeeds! Jennifer Kent is extremely masterful in creating tension and scares. I can't think of one jump scare in the entire film which is so unusual and commendable. Instead, we're left terrified from nightmarish imagery and sounds. I dare anyone note to get chilled to the core when the Babadook is hovering over the bed chanting 'baba-dook-dook-DOOOK!'The Babadook is so much more than just a 'scary' film though. It carries so much depth if you're willing to read into it more. It has a genuinely interesting and engaging character at the centre of it and is willing to throw the audience right into the middle of her mental breakdown. It's also really well-made, especially considering the teeny weeny budget. The production design is pretty outstanding and the infamous Mister Babadook book itself is beautifully made. This is a film which horror fans should welcome to their bosom. It's genuinely scary, masterfully directed and has a super screenplay to match. What more could you want? It's also a great advert for contraception if your partner is starting to get broody.",9,5,9,14 July 2015
Oldboy," Korean's finest
","Oldboy was the first Korean horror/thriller (or of any genre at all really) I had ever seen and the exceptional films which followed (Sympathy For Lady Vengeance, The Chaser etc.) could not beat the masterpiece that is Oldboy. Unfortunately I can't say that it still remains that way because last year I saw I Saw the Devil which is one of the greatest films I've ever seen and surpassed Oldboy, but not by a lot. Oldboy is a phenomenal achievement. From its directing, to its acting, to the unpredictable and frankly genius writing. It's a masterpiece and one which is not hard to forget.The story is absolutely horrible and it pulls on my heart strings more every time I watch it! It's thoroughly gripping right from its brilliant opening shot, as it tells the story of a man imprisoned in a room for 15 years. It's difficult to comprehend and you'd be a robot if you didn't feel for the man! You might think that watching a man in a room for 15 minutes would be really boring, but Park (the director, not a park) manages to keep the most boring situation absolutely thrilling and a visual feast. We really get into Oh Dae Su's mind-set as we see his schizophrenic symptoms of ants crawling out of his skin. It's incredibly intense and your willing for him to escape.Of course he's subjected to even more psychological torture when he is freed as he has to find out who is kidnapper is, but more importantly why he was kidnapped. Oldboy isn't so much of a who's dunnit, but a why's dunnit which is what makes every frame so gripping. Unfortunately most films which are set-up like this as one big build up rely on a breath-taking finale and reveal, but fail to deliver, take Knowing for example. You don't need to worry about this with Oldboy as it features one of the greatest and most compelling finales ever! The screenplay is endlessly intelligent and imaginative, creating a multi-layered story with characters you can really feel for. What makes Oldboy so great is that you can actually sympathise with the 'villain' of the tale and sometimes condemn the heroe's actions.The three dimensional characters are breath of fresh air, compared to the 2D kids we often get. Oldboy isn't just great because of its ending, the journey getting there is equally as breath-taking and involving. Oldboy features one of the greatest fight scenes in film history and is sure to be engraved in your mind. I'd put it up there with the crazy 88 fight scene in Kill Bill, it's just a technical marvel. It's also just one example of Park's phenomenal directing. It's incredibly stylish as well as evoking the character's feelings. At first Oh Dae Su is just a vengeful maniac, but then he becomes more and more human as we find out things about him which I won't spoil.In the end Oldboy is a masterpiece. It's obvious that Park was a former philosophy student as the film contains so many provoking dilemmas. Not only is it a gritty revenge thriller, but it also has a huge heart and a massive emotional impact. The wondrous music also acts as another character in the film! By the end of it Oldboy will have you submitting to its knees in a puddle of tears with its cruel, but admirable finale. I can't see the American remake being any where near this standard. Make sure you see this, before you see that one!",10,3,8,7 December 2012
The Prestige," I'm under no illusion. This is phenomenal!
","Move over you Nolan sisters because we have new Nolan talents in town! Christopher and Johnathan Nolan (the Nolan brothers, as I like to affectionately call them) already crafted a masterpiece from 'Memento' with Johnathan coming up with the idea and Chris turning it into a screenplay and fantastic film, and now they've both worked on the screenplay adapted from the book, 'The Prestige' once again with Chris in the drivers seat, he does not give a disappointing ride. I've almost seen all of Christopher Nolan's films now, with me giving most of them a 10, which is why I was incredibly excited for 'The Prestige' and why my expectations were high. Luckily they were met.As soon as the film started I knew that I was going to love it. It just had Chris' fingerprints all over it, a great feeling of scale and scope, which he multiplied by ten to give us the exceptional 'Inception'. We are immediately thrown in to the world of a magician and we immediately care about this world and the characters in it. Like all of Nolan's films, it is incredibly involving and sucks you in, making you wish it would never end! 'The Prestige' is pure escapism, and although is much less confusing than 'Memento' and 'Inception' it certainly is no less intelligent.Chris has a knack of presenting confusing ideas in an accessible way. 'The Prestige' should be a mess with it consistently moving backward and forward in time, but with Nolan it completely works and helps to make it even more thrilling than it already is. The directing is stylish and the sets lavish. There's a wonderful Victorian atmosphere, with beautiful lofty settings, (such as the theatres) it's a real treat for the eyes and with a wonderful scores by Hans Zimmer, it's an equal treat for the ears too.But it's the story and well-handled themes that keep this film ticking. I wouldn't read into this film too much, just like with 'The Cabin in the Woods' all you need to know is that some friends spend the night at a cabin, all you need to know with 'The Prestige' is that it's about a bitter rivalry from two magicians. Both of them as malicious as each other, although I did feel more for Hugh Jackman's character (though that might be just because I don't like Christian Bale as much). Both magicians rise to stardom, but once Christian performs an incredible trick (presented in such a genius simplistic and underwhelming way) it leaves Hugh in an obsessive quest to perform it.The theme of obsession is explored deeply, similarly to 'Black Swan' (although of course no where near that great!) and you, the audience, suddenly becomes involved too. The pacing is relentless, just like in any Christopher Nolan film and so the film feels incredibly long, although I don't mean that in a negative way at all, if anything it's positive because it has a truly epic feeling that's hard to wash away after the credits roll up. It's also full of mesmerising twists and turns that actually had me gasping at times! All leading up to a jaw-dropping ending that would be a tragedy if you knew about it before watching it. Of course the most genius thing about the film is that it's written in the same structure as a magic trick! 'The Prestige' is another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan, who's up there with Darren Aronofosky for making consistently amazing films (although I do prefer Darren's incredible visual style). 'The Prestige' is thoroughly entertaining and pure escapism. The writing and directing are top notch and deliver a mesmerising film of both quality and quantity. It is absolutely gripping and absorbing, making you try to work out the impossible puzzle with Hugh! Some scenes were heart-pounding and seriously exciting and the climax is powerful as well as holding a good moral. See 'The Prestige', the world's greatest film about magic tricks!",10,0,1,1 July 2012
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," More of a strange like than a love
","My immediate reaction to Dr. Strangelove once it finished was one of dislike. I thought it was talky, boring, plot less and overrated. However, since I've had time to let it sink in I've begun to like it a lot more on reflection. It's undeniably very well-made and beautifully shot, yet it still gives no inclination to Stanley Kubrick's colossal genius of scale and intelligence which he would later produce in 2001.To be honest I never fancied Dr. Strangelove. Watching a political comedy is my idea of hell, however I thought I'd finally give it a try as I'm venturing through every Stanley Kubrick film. It's not a laugh out loud kind of comedy; it's more of a lightly amusing one, although I must admit that some parts had me chuckling. I especially enjoyed the part where the president talks to a drunken Dimitri. Other bits of comedy fell flat for me, however such as the Nazi stuff, although I do understand that comedy is very subjective so it's just a matter of what you find funny. My favourite comedy film is Mrs. Doubtfire, so judge me however you like.I found the story surprisingly straightforward. It's basically set in three locations: The planes about to bomb Russia, the office of the mad general and the war room. The film is essentially just about trying to stop bombs landing on Russia in order to prevent a nuclear Holocaust. However, because it's such a bold idea it remains quite involving. The running time is also very tight so it prevents it from getting too boring.Strangelove is a film which I strangely liked, more than loved. I think that repeat viewings will help to uncover its hidden intelligence. However, for me it's a step backward from Stanley's previous three films (Lolita, Paths of Glory and The Killing) which I enjoyed more. I must say that Peter Sellers was fantastic in this though and it is definitely well worth a watch. Who would've thought that just four years post-Strangelove, Stanley would release such a masterpiece?",6,1,5,22 April 2015
The Expendables," Fun 80's throwback, but ultimately a let-down
","Like most men, I loved the idea of all the old action heroes getting together and giving a back-to-basics, fun and explosive 80's throwback that didn't take itself too seriously. Now, in the end I did enjoy most of it and would definitely check out the sequel, but what spoilt it for me was Sly's heavy-handed direction and mechanical dialogue. The action is filmed way too frantically, extremely up close with very quick cuts so it's almost impossible to tell what's going on and to who (a problem also in the recent A-Team remake.) The finale was just a fiery and explosive blur, which ultimately takes the intensity and the audience out of the action and feeling very detached. I see this as important because the film is a love letter to old action flicks. What made the action in The Dark Knight so tense was that it was approached methodically, very few quick cuts used to make it seem more realistic and little shaky cam. The Expendables camera shakes like an earthquake's hit it! There's also a problem with the odd really bad CGI effect, making the film seem cheaper than it is. However, I did enjoy the comedy aspect and the banter. The storyline was refreshingly simple and thus easy to get into, I just think it would've been a much better experience if Sly wasn't behind the camera as well as in front of it!",5,1,2,15 December 2012
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The greatest film ever made?
","It's difficult to tell you what my favourite film is because I have so many that I admire and they're all quite different. Depending on my mood I might tell you that Black Swan is my favourite film, or that Kill Bill is, but mostly I'll tell you that Sweeney Todd is. I've lost count the amount of times I've seen Sweeney Todd and I can't tell you how much I was addicted to it when I first saw it. I'd be singing all the songs, always watching the film, quoting from it. Thankfully, I'm not quite so obsessed with it now, but it will always be in my heart.Now, I hate musicals. I thought I'd start off by telling you that because you might read that it's a musical and be instantly struck off. I find that songs drag the film down, slowing the pace and being just unnecessary! They're also unnecessarily cheery like in The Sound of Music or Dancin' in the Rain. Sweeney Todd is a completely different type of beast. Have you ever heard a song about cannibalism before? About vengeance and murder? I have and they're incredible! There's not one song out of place in Sweeney Todd and it's pure lyrical genius from Stephen Soundheim. They're also undeniably catchy and memorable, unlike Singin' in the Rain's songs for example. Some huge numbers really capture the scope of the film, whilst the smaller ones bring it down to a personal and more human level. You seriously do not need to worry if you hate musicals!Sweeney Todd opens with the greatest title sequence in history. It completely captures the mood of the film and lets you know that this is Tim Burton's work! Like all great films it the look of the film is utterly breath taking. Blacks are blacker than black and colour rarely shines through. It's completely moody and stylistic, capturing the tone of the film perfectly and casting a beautifully melancholic atmosphere over the film. The incredible sets are heart-stopping to look at at times and it never fails to give me chills when Sweeney picks up his razor, holds it to the huge window and says, 'At last my arm is complete again!'But this isn't Avatar! It isn't all visual and no brain. Sweeney Todd's story is absolutely masterful. Like all the best story's, it's about revenge, revenge on the evil judge who locked him up and stole his wife and child. Not many films can easily achieve making you sympathise with a serial killer, but here you can. He's a tragic character who you can't help but feel sorry for and want to see him get his revenge. It also thrives off of its wonderful characters played impeccably by everyone. Of course johnny Depp steals the show with his power house performance and surprisingly strong voice. Helena Bonham Carter adds a well-needed female touch and humour to the role, Alan Rickman is perfect menacing as the judge, Timothy Spall does his mincing incredibly well as the BEadle and Sacha baron Cohen shows that he really can act as the wonderfully extravagant Pirelli!Tim's directing is also as perfect as everything else in the film. Some breathtaking camera shots really propel the film into a league of its own. Equally the costumes are beautiful and highly memorable. The whole film is likely one you're never forget and never forgive yourself for not going to see! It all builds up to an incredible finale that tugs hard at your heart strings and has you gasping in shock. It's one of the best endings I've ever seen and leaves a very large print on you.With an incredible score bellowing throughout, Sweeney Todd is one of those rare films that are just perfect! If there was any justice in the world Sweeney Todd should've won best picture, best director, best screenplay, best music, best actor, best actress, best cinematography, best costumes, best set design etc. at the Oscars! It's a cinematic masterpiece which is spectacular to look at and to listen to. Pick this up on blu-ray and at last your arm will be complete again!",10,7,8,2 December 2012
Shutter Island," If you appreciate films, your eyes are sure not to shutter
","I saw 'Shutter Island' for the third time last night, and even though it's still meant to be a mystery thriller, you'd think that once you know the mystery, you don't need to see it again. Well that's where you and I are both wrong. Each time I watch it, the mystery remains as strong and as complex as ever. This is much more than a mystery thriller, it's an experience, very much similar to 'Black Swan', we meet a man who seems completely sane when we first meet him, and a mystery that sounds quite simple, but as we stay longer on the island and as the plot thickens, we turn as crazy as Teddy, which is what makes 'Shutter Island' so utterly absorbing.Probably the most important feature to note, which is what makes this film such a masterpiece, is Martin's superb direction. Right from the first shot on the boat with the obvious green screen backdrop, we immediately get the feel for what time zone we're in. Directing as careful and as attention to detail as this is extremely rare to come across nowadays. Martin puts the audience right in the middle so we can experience the horrors with Teddy, as we are quite literally placed into his mind. Some of the flash-back sequences are so emotional (particularly the last one which is amazingly intense, especially at the cinema). Martin makes everything feel real. Which is what makes it so gripping.The screenplay is also first class. My family all find 'Shutter Island' boring, and I think it's because half the time they can't be bothered to listen to what the mystery is about, so they get completely lost and bored. 'Shutter Island' has an extremely complex and very interesting story that deserves to be listened to and appreciated. It's almost Tarantino-like in a way, as it turns everything into a philosophy and really provokes thought from the audience. It's involving and if you do actually listen you will be completely on edge the whole time, right up until the shocking ending, which clearly had a lot of thought put into it.The performances are also compelling, with Leonardo probably in one of his best roles. he plays Teddy how he should be, confused, emotionally torn apart and extremely intelligent. The supports are also good with Leonardo's creepy wife, Delores, also played with flare and air of ambiance.'Shutter Island' is one of the best films I have ever seen. Almost everything about it is perfect, it's beautifully written, directed to perfection with lots of thrills, tension and sizzling suspense. Really, if you haven't seen 'Shutter Island' you are missing out on one of the most compelling and original stories in decades. See it now!",10,1,2,18 October 2011
Lost in Translation," Nothing lost, nothing gained
","After hearing the hype surrounding this film, and even hearing it's one of Quentin Tarantino's favourite films, I was expecting a really good romcom. Unfortunately all I got was a 'nice', slightly above average romcom that left me feeling fuzzy inside.'Lost In Translation' does have a few laugh out loud scenes and the performances are good. What makes this different from other romcoms is that it feels real! It feels completely believable, with subtle humour, rather than the not very funny in-your-face slapstick humour found in most romcoms today.If you're looking for an interesting character development and friendship story then look no further because that is what you're getting! But I didn't think 'WOW!' At the end of it, I just thought 'ah, that was nice' and got on with the rest of my life.'Lost In Translation' didn't really rock my boat for me, but I prefer intense, powerful films, rather than light comedies. Overall, it was slow, motionless but nice.",6,0,1,9 April 2011
Barry Lyndon," Like watching a very old oil painting dry... But somehow it remains engrossing!
","There is nothing about Barry Lyndon which is appealing to me. Everything is against it, and if it didn't have Stanley's name attached to it then I probably would never give it the time of day. It's basically a three hour period drama which moves at a snail's pace and is full of dull, stiff and unlikable characters. So, why did I like it? Why did I not find it tedious and boring? These are questions I'm still asking myself and it appears to be the hypnotic nature of Stanley's films. 2001: A Space Odyssey is painfully slow and has no memorable characters (except HAL) yet it's one of the best films I've ever seen.Let's start with its beauty. Even the haters can't deny the sheer gorgeousness of pretty much every shot. The film opens to a haunting classical score and throws up a landscape shot which could easily be mistaken for an oil painting. Every landscape/exterior shot had my jaw on the floor at the sheer beauty of it, and I'm not one to get all excited over scenery. I don't like to use the word 'perfect' because things rarely are, however that's exactly the word I'd use to describe some of the shots. Just perfect. The costumes and sets are wonderfully lavish too and do a great job of plunging you into the life and atmosphere of those times.Even though the film is a whopping 180 minutes there wasn't one moment when I was bored. Perhaps some parts dragged on for a little too long in the war half, but I was never fed up and the film didn't feel like it was three hours long. Not a lot happens but it somehow remains engrossing. It moves at its own pace and it seems to work well at creating an atmosphere that evokes its period.It's a very cold film and all the characters seem distant. Even the title character doesn't give much away, and lady Lyndon must say about four lines throughout the entire film! Something about it remains captivating though and not all of it is devoid of emotion. In fact, the scenes involving Lyndon and his son were very moving and quite powerful. It was also interesting how the film was told in two parts and both involving battlefields of one kind or another.Unfortunately, Ryan O Neal's performance is a little lacklustre. His Irish accent was all over the place and he didn't entirely convince in the role. The rest of the film however is quite exquisite. It's easy to see why people don't like it, because even I'm not quite sure what I found so appealing about it all. It is a technical master class though, and whilst it may be a step down from 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange it is still a great film in its own right. Stanley returned to breaking the mould with his next film though, which could very well be my favourite from his filmography.",8,2,4,30 April 2015
Interstellar," Best sci-fi ever?
","children I shall be talking about Interstellar. But before I do, I think I better give you a little context, just to show how high my expectations were for this film. I love Christopher Nolan. I am a Nolanite, or Nolanoid, or whatever people who like Christopher Nolan are called. I've pretty much loved every film he's ever done. It confuses me when people slag him off because he's clearly the best writer/director to be working on mainstream blockbuster films since Steven Spielberg, only I think that his films are much better than Steven's.His films are only so thrilling because of the intimacy he creates between the audience and the characters. As soon as I heard Christopher Nolan's next film was a sci-fi film called, Interstellar, I was excited. I was so excited that I only treated myself to one viewing of the teaser trailer and first trailer. It was enough, I was sold and I didn't want to see any other trailer, because I wanted to know and see as little as possible.I decided that Interstellar needed to be seen in IMAX, so I booked my ticket to see Interstellar on the biggest screen in the UK. Even though the film had garnered some mixed reviews (I was hoping for full-on rave ones, like when The Dark Knight and Inception came out) I still put my trust into Christopher to deliver me something extraordinary. I don't know if it's the gigantic screen talking, but Interstellar absolutely delivered.This was the best experience I've ever had at the cinema. The huge screen and ear-popping sound made the experience incredibly intense and by the end of it, I felt like I had been for a little trip out in space. I'm not sure if this will translate quite so well on your TV screen at home, however the film is unmissable whatever you choose to see it on. Whilst a lot of the film does rely on extraordinary visuals and heart-stopping set-pieces, at its heart it's an intimate family drama which suggests that your children are your one and only important universe.I was absolutely sucked into the film from the moment it started. The stuff before Matthew goes into space is probably some of the best stuff in the film. We learn so much about Coop and he becomes a worthy character to invest three hours into (three hours which fly by, I might add). There's a strong focus on the relationship between Coop and his daughter, and it's this relationship which drives the film right up to, and including, its jaw-dropping conclusion. The first hour is also quite funny too, which was a nice surprise as Nolan doesn't normally dabble in too much humour.There's a really emotional scene where Coop wants to say goodbye to his daughter, who he doesn't know when he's going to see again, before his space travels. It's beautifully acted by both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy and is at the powerful centre of the whole film. After this the film adopts an entirely new setting. Literally. We're blasted off into space and the fun really begins. The less you know about the space scenes, the better, as it's a lot of fun to try and work out just where the film is going! Suffice to say that Interstellar is jam-packed with eye-popping visuals and intense thrills which dwarf last year's Gravity into a speck of space dust by comparison.With The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher proved that he could direct on a big scale and Interstellar is his biggest yet. He has an ambition which most directors lack and instead of kicking him down for it, we should be nurturing it! Interstellar presents us with new and exciting ideas which colossally blow other mainstream films out of the water. The action is also elevated to unreachable new heights thanks to Hans Zimmer's astonishing score. It's a haunting piece of music that will be ringing in your head for hours after the film has finished. He's left the big drums and strings behind and re-invented himself with a bizarre church organ which perfectly matches the dark atmosphere of the film.A lot of people have expressed a strong disliking to the final 40 minutes of Interstellar. I can see why as up until then the film is more or less possible to understand. It's complex, but it's still easy enough to follow. However, Christopher completely rips up the rule book and Interstellar goes seriously barmy in the last 40 minutes. Personally, I loved the third act and it just goes to show the sheer creativity and ambition which Christopher Nolan has going inside his head. I found it all very interesting both on a visual and intellectual level. I don't understand it all, but I have my theories and I'm sure that there will be a mountain of theories cropping up on the interweb.Interstellar is a truly remarkable experience. It boasts awesome ideas and visuals, but it never forgets its heart. I'm a tough cookie to make cry, but I'm not going to lie (ooh poetry!) there were three occasions when I had tears filling up in my eyes. There are some astonishingly powerful and moving scenes in there which reminds me why I go to the cinema. I don't just want crazy visuals and excitement, I want to be moved and I want to be invested in characters so that I care what happens to them at the end. Interstellar more than achieves that.I'll need to give it another watch to work out where I'd put it on Christopher Nolan's mesmerising filmography, but he hasn't let me down. I hope that Interstellar is seen as a sci-fi classic in years to come because it really does deserve that accolade.Read more weird, dazzling and uncut reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com",10,9,22,18 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," This ain't no Mickey Mouse s@#!
","I remember when I saw Full Metal Jacket for the first time. I must've been about fourteen or fifteen years old and decided to watch it when it was on late at night of a weekend. I remember being compelled by the first 40 minutes (although finding it slightly repetitive) and finding the rest of it completely boring and aimless. Fast forward five years later to present day and you'll find me currently going through the whole of Stanley Kubrick's filmography and sticking on Full Metal Jacket for a second time. Have my opinions changed? Yes they have.I no longer find the first 40 minutes repetitive. In fact, I think the first 40 minutes of Full Metal Jacket is one of the best things Stanley has ever created. The first 40 minutes are so strong that the rest of the film is unfortunately left in its shadow, but more on that in a bit. This half perfectly illustrates the conversion of human beings into cold, emotionless killers. Right from the off the recruits are stripped of their names and instead given labels. They're all made to have the same hairstyle (or lack of), same clothes and shout only when shouted to. All of them even act like robots when training in unison. All except Private Pyle.The story of Private Pyle's descent into madness is one of the most memorable put on film. At first we find his physical and mental inabilities amusing with the electrifying Lee Ermey shouting hilarious insults at him and Pyle failing miserably at obstacle courses. However, as it progresses the constant bullying becomes incredibly disturbing. There's a fantastically dark moment where all the private's team together to beat Pyle late at night with some soap. In the end you can't help but feel sympathy for him.It all accumulates to the most powerful moment in the film where Pyle goes totally insane in the toilet. Everything in this scene is flawless. The brooding music, Vincent D'Onofrio's haunting performance, the lighting, and the directing. All of this makes for an incredibly atmospheric and frightening scene with a chilling pay-off which is both surprising and unforgettable. The trouble is, how can you follow this scene? The answer is, you can't. So far the centre of the film has been the relationship between Vincent D'Onofrio and R Lee Ermey, thus with these characters gone a new film begins.We're plunged without warning into Vietnam, however unlike my fifteen year-old self, I actually didn't find these parts boring. I just get frustrated because I'm not entirely sure what Stanley is trying to say. We sort of get little snapshots of life in Vietnam with Private Joker bobbing about and meeting folk. The film doesn't really go anywhere, yet it still remains largely interesting, just nowhere near as interesting as the mesmerising first half. I did like the prostitute encounters though and thought they had a lot of interesting things to say about humanity.The film suddenly gets really good again when the team encounter a sniper. For Stanley Kubrick, it's actually a fairly conventional war scene, albeit brilliantly done. It's full of tension, remains gripping and feels very real. It's incredible to think that the whole Vietnam sequences were filmed in London! Stanley then turns to his unusual self when the group encounter who the sniper is. It's a very uncomfortable and haunting moment which results in the famous Mickey Mouse chant at the very end.I'm not entirely sure what Full Metal Jacket is trying to say, but I'm sure that Stanley has popped in a load of horrendously clever hidden metaphors which still haven't fully been worked out yet. The whole film is of course a visual feast with superb directing from Stanley. However, content-wise I don't think it's as strong as his previous Paths of Glory. Full Metal Jacket may be much better in the technical department, but it feels uneven. Joker is nowhere near as interesting as Pyle and so the film begins to sag in comparison. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the film farm more than when I first layed eyes upon it and will certainly be giving it some more watches!",8,0,1,10 June 2015
Nightcrawler," Blooming marvellous!
","I avoided Nightcrawler when it was initially stirring around because I thought it was some sort of X-Men spin off. Of course, once the positive reviews came flooding in and I realised that it wasn't about a flexible mutant, but about a man who becomes obsessed with filming violent street crimes for the news, I became interested.Nightcrawler is a brilliant film and manages to do everything right. At the centre of it all is Jake Gyllenhaal's sensational performance as Lou Bloom. He's surely the most ruthless businessman since Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, although his autistic characteristics make him far less charming and compelling. Nonetheless, Jake completely morphs into the character and delivers a performance well worthy of an Oscar. His slimy grin is enough to make anyone's skin crawl and he's totally devoid of any moral compass, however you can't help but admire his knowledge and ambition.The film clocks in at almost two hours but not even a second of a scene is wasted. After a fast-paced first half where we witness Lou's rise into the crime filming industry the film takes a slower, yet stronger approach in the second half where we focus on one particular case which is sure to shock. There are some wonderfully tense scenes towards the end of the film where I could not take my eyes off the screen. It's almost as if you're there in the street with the characters.I loved how the media was so cynically portrayed here and the underlying themes of how voyeuristic society has become are relevant and dealt with well. The media is a ruthless business and it's great how the news values of having white, middle-class people under attack is put on display.There's very little to fault with Nightcrawler. Not only is it intelligent, but it is also thoroughly entertaining with an engaging story and captivating main character who is sure to become a cult icon. Jake has never been better and some aspects of his performance are truly chilling. It's just a wonderfully made film and one which I hope to revisit fairly often.Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com",8,8,12,9 January 2015
Watchmen," Made by nerds, about nerds, for nerds
","Superheroes aren't my things at all, I like 'Spiderman' because it's fun nd doesn't take itself too seriously and I like 'Batman Begins' for the opposite reason that it's very dark, realistic and adult-like. So I heard about 'Watchmen' how good it was and how bloody violent it is and decided to give it a go. The opening was absolutely incredible, the cinematography and stylish directing blew me away. The title sequence was also really great, directed flawlessly. I have seen Zack's version of 'Dawn of the Dead' and really enjoyed it and so my hopes were suddenly rising for our dear 'Watchmen' with it's beautiful opening shots but it all ends there.I'm not familiar with the comic of 'Watchmen' I have never read a comic in my life apart from the funny ones in the newspaper, but not Fred Basset he's crap! So I didn't know what I was letting myself in for, I'm all about trying new things and I always go into a film with an open mind but either my mind wasn't opened enough or the film was simply a load of rubbish! Darren Aronofsky my favourite director was up for directing this but turned it down along with other countless directors for it's complicity and now I can see why. A man with an inaudible croaky voice jumps up wearing a mask with moving black splodges and I'm meant to take this seriously? When the blue man came on I began to really doubt this film.Call me crooked but 'Watchmen' did have the potential to be really fun. From the opening scene I was expecting complete 'Sin City' style action throughout! Which would've been really fun. But instead it had been ruined by taking itself dreadfully seriously. No one can't say they didn't have a chuckle to themselves about the glowing blue man with the ridiculous animated penis! He moved it moved! The whole film was ridiculous really and we'r meant to believe all this. I can list countless things that are laughable like President Nixon looking like David Walliems as Omar from 'Come Fly With Me' but that would be a waste of time, because I don't think the word count is big enough.'Watchmen' does look like it's meant for kids, but it clearly isn't with it's violence (sometimes insanely!) and themes such as rape and paedophilia along with a very untasteful sex scene. Yet it can't be for adults because were watching men dressed up as superheroes! I look at 'Watchmen' as a confused child, it doesn't know what it wants to be or what it's trying to do, so it just lingers annoyingly by your feet until you want to kick it in the stomach. The screenplay just crams far too much in the already frighteningly long running time (it feels longer) so you just don't know where you are or what's going on. The flashbacks were the only thing that interested me in the film, it seemed as it 'Watchmen' would've been a hell of a lot more compelling with the back-story being told instead of this confusing and depressing lark about the heroes reuniting! It's also quite sexist, with the women superheroes being dressed in tight leather swim suits just so the geeks who are interested in the film can weirdly drool at her. There are strokes of interest, some of the action is stylishly filmed but for an action film ,there is hardly any action in it! It then decides to be brutishly violent for the sake of it, just to remind us this is meant to be an adults film.With a complete mish-mash of plot (is there a plot) and absolutely ridiculous dialogue such as when the lady is sleeping with the blue man as multiple blue hands caress her mouth she says 'it's like tasting a battery'. It's depressing Hollywood rubbish. It reminds me of 'The Incredibles' with all the fun being completely sucked out of it. 'Watchmen' is something that can't be fixed because it seems as if the original comic was already smashed to pieces. The opening seemed like it had potential (which is why I'm giving it a 2/10 instead of 1) bu then fell flat on its face. 'Watchmen' is unwatchable.",2,3,9,16 August 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Lord of the Disappointment
","OK, so I'm 18 years old in a weeks time and am unashamed to admit that I've never read any of Tolkien's books nor even had the desire to. The truth is that I'm not particularly into all that magic Harry Potter stuff and would take the stark intensity of Chirstopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy over the Lord of the Rings any day. But after hearing such hype, especially from my favourite critic who often loves what I love, I thought the time had come to record them when they came on the TV. My plans were ceased from an orange man called Dale Winton, a program that my family would rather record than Lord of the Rings (they wouldn't even give it the time of day!) But fast-forward about 7 months later and there they are again on Channel 4, Christmas day, and so I stick the record on.I didn't really know what to expect, but after hearing all the unbelievable hype I was excited to take a trip to Middle Earth and see what was so amazing about it all! But unfortunately I came out watching a fun, if not occasionally dragging, swords and sorcery epic that did lose me on more than a couple of occasions. I enjoyed it enough to go and watch the other two, but was simply not blown away like everyone else. I enjoyed the opening narration about the origins of the ring and its wearer etc. I thought that it effectively transported the audience into another world which also had some rather breath-taking imagery. I also enjoyed the time at the shire where there was some very likable characters and surprising humour that did not go a miss! It was just once the hooded horsemen were introduced that things began to drag, and unsurprisingly in a three hour film. It began to lose me with its unnecessary complexity such as the encounter with Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee, that scene confused me and some of the dialogue also had me puzzled thanks to their wizardy speak such as, 'We must retire to Mount Maduro' etc. I also felt that some characters and plot lines were unnecessary and detracted from the story, such as the elf woman who wasn't in it for long and didn't really have a lot to do, other than send a tidal wave to the hooded horsemen. The plot also went off on a tangent such as when they 'enterted the realm of the witch'. I didn't feel that there was any need for it and it just slowed down the pace that was beginning to pick up.It also takes quite a long time for the fellowship to actually be created, as it's from there that the adventure really begins and its at least mid-way through, if not over. However, there were a lot of good points about the film. The characters were very strong and I found myself forming attachments to them (not a euphemism). When one of them bit the dust, I did actually care! There are relationships which we can all relate to and it does help to drive the story along and make you care about their quest. There was also some breath-taking cinematography and scenery which really showed off the epic scope of the film. Some of the directing was also very impressive and memorable such as the sweeping shot over Christopher Lee's place.However, in a film with a three hour running time I did expect a little more action than I got! I also didn't think the action was that well handled, with shots being taken too close and too many quick cuts which make it hard to see what's going on. I'd say that there's more thrills and fun to be had in King Kong and that the action sequences in that are better handled. Hopefully we can see Peter Jackson mature as a director as the series goes on like Christopher Nolan did.In the end, it's down to personal preference. I'm not entirely into magic and fantasy, but the characters and underlying simple narrative makes the film relatable and very watchable. I expect more from the following two, as Fellowship did leave me feeling disappointed. I didn't find it as amazingly mind-blowing as everyone else, but maybe that's because I haven't read the book/s. I may enjoy them more if I set my expectations at a lower level, but nevertheless the spectacular imagery and set pieces do make this film memorable.",7,1,2,30 December 2012
Pitch Black," You want to see Pitch Black? Just turn your TV off.
","Right from the opening I knew I was going to end up hating 'Pitch Black' just because I have a unfair lack of interest for the sci-fi genre. So we're in a space shuttle and everything seems all futuristic and weird, the camera's making a lot of use out of the hand-held, shake to create a feeling of panic and we crash land on this deserted planet with three suns, creating an extremely off-putting filter, you'll be wishing it would just hurry up and turn pitch black! The filters are really awful and in bad taste, the range from an over exposed goldy filter to a strange black and white looking blue filter which doesn't really make sense, it's as if the directors just putting them there because he can. We are then introduced to far too many characters that we lose track of and therefore don't particularly care about! The least one being the 'hero' Riddick, played by the lack-luster Vin Diesal who thinks that he looks cool by wearing swimming goggles in the middle of the desert! I thought he was about to jump into a pool or something! Anyway, he's annoying and egotistical there's no way we can like him especially as the other characters make out he's the bad guy anyway!After a long wait (about an hour) the film eventually revs up a bit, the planet plunges into darkness so we can get rid of the blinding filters and we're treated to poorly animated aliens and the film then plays out as one big rip-off of 'Aliens' in the dark! This swarm of creatures attack the group as we egg them on to, however Imust admit there were times of excitement and some parts were well-paced.But when all is said and done 'Pitch Black' is 'Aliens' with a clunky screenplay and just plain weird directing! It's full of unlikable characters and an empty ending. Although there are times of suspense and exciting action, there needs to be more substance to find it engaging.",3,1,10,2 August 2011
The Hills Have Eyes," The hills do have eyes! (and a bit of blood!)
","Wes Craven created the original 'The Hills Have Eyes' in 1977, and the concept was certainly original and had lots of potential. Unfortunately Wes didn't manage to make a classic, but instead an average 70's slasher film. Here, Alexandre Aja takes that brilliant idea and perfects it into exactly what Wes was trying to achieve.Of course only horror lovers will really understand why this film is so great. Others will simply think it's mindless violence, however I don't believe it is. At times it can seem like killing for the sake of killing but that only occurred to me once during the whole film and is that such a bad thing anyway? What's great here is the wonderful screenplay by Aja himself (I'll call him Aja because that amuses me) it begins as a slow burner. We are given plenty of likable character development, which paints a wonderful portrait of family life. My family isn't like this but I can certainly imagine this would be an accurate portrayal for many other families. The key to a really masterful slasher is having characters who we can relate to and care about. Aja has got this down to a tee! So Aja gives us brilliant characters for the first 40 minutes and teases the audience with only slight cameos of the mutants and then BAM! We're given this truly brutal and hideously memorable scene in within 10 minutes where everything happens! I won't spoil it for you but it really is horrific and as with all French directors, outlandishly brutal and realistic.From here the film turns into this incredibly epic survival game where our anti-hero Doug goes on a bloody quest to find his baby. We're given suspense, tension (like in Aja's superb 'High Tension') and edge-of-your-seat bloody fight sequences that always ends with you going 'OOH!' or 'YOUCH!' But at the same time thinking just how perfect these sequences are.Aja's directing is really nice. He knows how to make the audience jump or how to make them pump with excitement. At times the cinematography can make you feel really isolated, with the long ominous shots of the desert hills and the endless planes of sand. This is film making at its best.Love slasher horror? Then you will absolutely adore this! 'The Hills Have Eyes' is 100x better than the original and that's due to Aja's remarkable directing and screenplay. The acting is pretty good to and the mutants are horrifying! Right from the make-up effects to the soundtrack, the hills do have eyes, they also have a heart and plenty of blood!",10,1,5,10 July 2011
Knowing," Knows a lot! Until the end
","Knowing is one of those sci-fi films that rely on a jaw-dropping ending. Something really well thought out and intelligent. Unfortunately Knowing fails to deliver that impact. The film starts off brilliantly with an interesting flashback to a distant little girl who scribbles a load of numbers into a time capsule. Flash-forward to 50 years later and who ends up getting that picture but Nicolas Cage's son (not his actual son, but you know). I thought the film did quite a good job of building up th characters and creating an involving storyline, so you cared what happened Nicolas and his family. Although some of it was schmaltzy and over-sentimental such as the sign language when his son went to bed, but it made a great effort of caring for the characters.Some of it did defy belief as well, such as randomly noticing that the bunch of numbers had a link to 9/11 but I suppose the story does need something to push it along, whatever that may be. But what's great about Knowing is that it's never boring, thanks to the great build-up to the disasters. The disasters themselves aren't that incredible, but the build-up of not knowing what's going to happen is highly suspenseful. As the mystery unfolds it also becomes incredibly gripping, and you look forward to what the end is going to offer! Unfortunately it doesn't offer much.I found the ending to be incredibly clunky and awkward. It didn't feel as if it fitted within the film and also seemed lazy and plonked. The ending was a total cop-out to me and it's a shame because the build-up getting there is marvellously entertaining, but all you get is a piece of hokum that deserved to be something intelligent. However, Knowing is not an amazingly clever film, it's just a piece of entertainment and it certainly achieves that. Nicolas Cage is as wooden as ever, but if you can over look that, then it's certainly a film worthy of your time (if you can learn to forgive the ending). The special effects are quite impressive too.",7,1,3,24 October 2012
The Shining," Heeeeeres a masterpiece!
","'The Shining' is one of the best horror films ever made. It's a classic and will remain timeless. The thing with Stanley Kubrick films is that after viewing them you seem to view the world sort of differently when you come out of the film. You start to see things from a different point of view when you watch another film. He truly is a one off director and this will remain as one of his best films!One of the best aspects (there are many) about this film is the directing by Stanley. He manages to build up a chilling atmosphere to a masterful affect. He makes us as the viewer seem as isolated as the characters through the ominous tracking shots of the long isolated hallways, the large echoes in the halls and the sublime mountain landscape which almost seems to be devouring them up. It is a truly chilling masterclass in how to direct a horror film! Some scenes create a choking atmosphere and an uncomfortable feeling towards the suspenseful dialogue, it's just genius! Some of the cinematography is beautiful.Also arguably the best aspect is the performance by Jack Nicholson. How did he not win an Oscar? He wasn't even bloody nominated! This will remain as one of the unanswered wonders of the world. The sheer anger of his character shoots through every last inch of him! He puts his heart and soul into the film and makes up for the hilariously bad acting from Shelley Duvall. Poor Shelley, she makes the film seem quite funny when it's obviously not suppose to. Her acting is atrocious and just pretty darn funny! (Something she'd say) but like I said, Jack does more than make up for her weak performance.Stanley's script is great! Instead of just copying the book, he takes the story and makes it his own vision. He leaves more questions to the viewers to answer, making them think and care about the characters. The screenplay is effective, inventive and very tense at times. Most importantly it's suspenseful and makes everything count! He also makes good use of symbolism and could be analysed in a way such greats like 'Black Swan' could be analysed.'The Shining' is also quite creepy thanks to Stanley's masterful directing. The ominous tracking shots of Danny on his trike, the weird unexplainable images and an atmosphere that really cranks up the terror. If you are a lover of films, then you should be able to appreciate everything that is good in 'The Shining'. Aside from it being exciting and creepy, it's also really well-written and directed to perfection. Go watch!",10,0,1,10 August 2011
American Beauty," Beautiful!
","The first time I saw 'American Beauty' was when I was around 8 years old so it's a hazy memory. Unfortunately I had to go to bed about 40 minutes in, but some scenes have stayed with me since (I'm 17 now). The second time I saw American Beauty was on the eve of my blonde friend's birthday party (I must've been around 15) and I was totally gripped. Unfortunately I had to force myself to bed as it was on late, and left 40 minutes in, in order to be awake-looking for the early morning start the next day. Yesterday, I finally got the chance to see American Beauty the whole way through. And it was amazing.Those first 40 minutes hadn't really left my head before. They were just absolutely gripping, full of incredible visuals, cinematography and absorbing writing and character development. Thankfully, the rest of the film doesn't disappoint either and accumulates to being one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I wasn't expecting to give it a perfect 10, as I only reserve that for the most special films, but this really is an incredible and outstanding film. It thoroughly deserves its best picture award!What makes American Beauty works is its well-observed characters. At the centre of the film we've got Lester Burnham, who is fantastically played by Kevin Spacey (another throughly deserving award winner) and is going through a mid-life crisis. We can highly sympathise with him and his childish rebellion. You feel sorry for him and his loveless marriage, his ill relationship with his daughter and unforgiving job. You're almost rooting for him when he rebells. However, his acutely observed character is also wonderfully flawed by taking drugs and having vivid fantasies about his daughter's which are beautifully filmed.The other characters are also as gripping and never shunned. We've got his controlling wife, also going through a mid-life breakdown, his moody daughter and her sexy friend as well as the weird family who've moved in next door, with their strange son and awful army dad. The film would need very little plot at all to keep it entertaining as all the characters are memorable and well-crafted, which means American Beauty never has a dull moment. Right from the startling opening, which confesses that Lester is going to die, the film never loses its grip on the audience as we're all in suspense as to who kills Lester and why!The playful screenplay by Alan Ball is incredible. It's also philosophical and very deep at times, as well as being consistently gripping and entertaining. There are some hilarious moments as well as some emotional and touching ones. As flawless as the script is the directing by Kate Winslet's ex. There is some breath-taking cinematography and striking visuals which add fuel to the already high burning fire. About every single shot is perfectly framed, making the film even more involving and seductive. American Beauty felt hypnotic at times, sucking you into the world of the film like Black Swan and The Artist achieved so memorably.American Beauty builds up to an incredibly powerful and emotionally-charged ending. Bringing together all the characters and leaving some ambiguity, so we don't feel at all patronised. Lester's final narration is very touching, memorable and rounds the film off perfectly. American Beauty is an amazing achievement in film-making. It's a beautifully observed drama about family life and the baggage which comes with it. There's great use of humour, superb writing, Oscar-worthy acting and sensational directing. American Beauty is the full package and is quite simply one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It was worth the 9 year wait!",10,7,11,6 November 2012
Dunkirk," How many times can Chris outdo himself?
","Life can deal you such cruel hands. I am the biggest Christopher Nolan fan so I've been excitedly awaiting Dunkirk ever since it was announced three years ago. I've been avoiding every trailer and every clip in fear of needless spoilers and have been savouring every review since its release. Now, almost one month after its release I have finally been able to see it! If it was any old film then I would've seen it on the day of its release, however this is a Christopher Nolan movie which means that it has to be seen on the biggest screen possible to get the full effect.So I took a trip up to London to catch Dunkirk on the BFI Imax, the biggest screen in England and I can safely say that it was worth the wait. Dunkirk is quite possibly the greatest cinema experience I have ever had, or at least the best since Interstellar which created similar immersive intensity in Imax. But even without the gargantuan screen and crystal clear sound, Christopher Nolan has created not just the greatest war film ever but one of the greatest films of any genre. It is truly a one of a kind film, breaking all kinds of war movie conventions and doing things that have never been attempted in any film before it. Extraordinarily, Nolan has outdone himself once again.Dunkirk is the equivalent of a cinematic pressure-cooker. From the moment the film begins, it's put on high heat and it barely lets up for its entire 100 minute running time. The opening scene is sensational. We watch as a tragically young soldier picks up a leaflet depicting how British troops are surrounded by Germans. There's an instant atmosphere of dread and panic which only intensifies when the first bullet explodes out of nowhere. We're used to guns firing all the time in films. This is the first time the sound of a bullet has sent shivers up my spine. The noise is so loud and so sharp that I found myself jolting in my seat and for the first time in a war film, feeling the same sense of fear the soldiers on screen are feeling.The weight of the situation really hits hard. The idea that these people could die at any moment feels Earth-shatteringly real. This is largely down to Christopher Nolan's directing which tries to squeeze as much realness as possible out of everything. Long takes are used as well as very few visual effects. The images feel so real that you almost forget that you're watching something that was staged. There's a moment near the beginning when a German plane flies over the troops and the roar of the engine matched with the fear in the soldier's faces and the over-powering dreadful score make it one of the most terrifying scenes I have ever seen on film. When the bombs hit, it's utterly devastating but filmed in the most beautiful way, largely in one shot which makes it feel all the more real.The main focus is on a story which presents a week of soldiers trying to survive on Dunkirk but there is also a more talky story which sees Mark Rylance taking his boat out to pick up some troops as well as an almost dialogue-free story where Tom Hardy (face-covered again) has tries shooting down enemy planes. It could have been messy but in the hands of Nolan these stories are expertly weaved and executed to perfection.Unsurprisingly many audiences haven't quite taken to the film. Average moviegoers expecting an ordinary film with characters you can root for are going to be disappointed. Dunkirk is pure cinema and is something that cannot be described or put into words, it's something you simply have to experience. It's the reason why I love films and why I go to the cinema, to be taken on a journey. This is why I'm a fan of directors like David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick whose works consistently provide an immersive escapism into another world. Dunkirk is exactly this. It's a film which sweeps you along with it and completely immerses you in the event.Whatever you look for in a film though, you can't deny the technical mastery of Dunkirk. I mean no hyperbole when I say that Dunkirk features some of the most spectacular images I have ever seen in a film. Planes sweeping over oceans, thousands upon thousands of soldiers lining up on a dark beach, ships sinking and engulfing people in water. These are some of the most breath-taking and indelible visuals I have ever come across. However, there are also quieter moments which haunt my mind. An older soldier throwing himself into the ocean and a heart-breaking final montage which ends each story on a spine-tingling powerful note are just as spectacular as the monumental set-pieces.Hans Zimmer also deserves a mention for providing yet again another remarkable score. Music always plays a big part in Nolan films, but in Dunkirk the music almost becomes another character. It's often dark and brooding but also serves to ratchet up the tension with a constant ticking which adds to the overall intensity. At times of relief though, it's uplifting and gave me perhaps the biggest chills I've ever had whilst watching a movie.Dunkirk is more than just a film, it's a work of art. I can't think of a more intense movie experience than this. by the time the film ended I felt shaken and adjusting to reality outside of the cinema was difficult. This is the first war film to actually drop you in the middle of the war. It's definitely worth going to see on Imax for the full experience, but it's just as unmissable on your TV at home. Hopefully the Academy will now finally recognise Nolan for the incredible talent that he is after Interstellar was cruelly snubbed. Dunkirk is truly extraordinary.",10,5,14,20 August 2017
The Intouchables," Very touchable!
","Prepare yourselves for one of the most touching relationships ever brought to screen! Forget Fred and Ginger, forget Humphrey and Ingrid, because now it's all about Phillipe and Driss. Most French films I watch are nasty (but brilliant) shockers like Inside and Martyrs. Of course I've seen the odd gentler one like, I've Loved You So Long but even that's depressing. The funniest French films I've seen are Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, Amelie and Micmacs, but Untouchable just about betters both of them. It's not just one of the most funny and touching French films I've seen, but just films in general. Only a seriously bitter and cynical person could hate Untouchable.The film opens with wit and energy as we see Phillipe and Driss trying to out-run and out-smart the police for speeding. It's a funny and clever sequence and just a taste for the even more amusing shenanigans to follow. But of course we can't just jump into the middle of the film! We need what Midge calls, 'a flash-back' so we can see how they got there. What Untouchable does so well is build up its characters so we can care about them. Driss comes from a working-class background, living in a tiny and over-crowded flat. He's also a thief and his Mum has kicked him out, and although Driss is a thief we can still care about him, especially as the film goes on and we see just how funny he is.Phillipe is the opposite. He's a hugely rich invalid with silly money to spend on paintings that look like 'a nosebleed' as Driss puts it. But like magnets opposites attract. Driss is obviously attracted to his lavish quarters, already bigger than the whole flat he used to live in! The film takes time building up their relationships, as we see them bond through some very funny and touching moments. The directors make the audience feel as though we're bonding with them, so in a sense it's a three-way relationship and becomes all the more personal. Untouchable is also a comedy, there are some hilarious moments which I won't spoil, but it had me and the audience laughing pretty much all the way through.The directing is really well done, and I also really liked the music which made some touching scenes even more touching! It's no wonder that Untouchable was a huge hit in France, because it's such a light-hearted and entertaining film, yet is also quite memorable too, thanks to the wonderful performances, witty screenplay and classy directing. Untouchable is a sort of rom-com but Jennifer Anniston is no where in sight! It's one of those 'buddy movies' which shows a touching kind of platonic love similar to that of Rain Man. It's a relationship we can all relate to and care about the couple involved.Untouchable is a French classic and one I hope to watching in years to come. I defy anyone to watch and not to become involved in Phillipe and Driss' wonderful relationship. An endlessly funny and moving film which those with a sense of humour can enjoy. It's a wonderful feel-good film!",9,6,11,4 April 2013
American History X," X Marks The Spot
","'American History X' opens with our Hitler-loving, lispy Edward Norton shooting down two black people with a swastika tattooed across his chest which perfectly depicts the mood and theme for the entire film. I absolutely loved 'American History X' and here's why.Tony Kaye directs this film to near perfection, right from the beautiful over-cranking shot in black and white (which cleverly outlines the battle between the blacks and the whites) to the intense rape scene in the shower, 'American History X' deals with some intense subject matter and is also quite upsetting violent which is probably why it didn't win the Oscar for 'Best Picture' although I'm pretty sure it deserved it.The cinematography is equally impressive and Edward Norton plays his character brilliantly and so does Edward Furlong as the confused teen heading down his older brother's path. What is great about this film is that it has an engaging story to tell and it tells it superbly through intelligent flashbacks and flawless directing. It deals with racism roughly, I mean that it doesn't hold back on shocking the audience which is good because it delivers a powerful punch by the time the credits role.The characterisation is superb and we get some really in-depth character analysis as well as well thought out scenes. I also found the screenplay remarkably impressive it's fast and intelligent and manages to build a believable story with an inspirational turn-around before a real bash of realism. The ending is incredibly emotional and thoughtful.'American History X' is for anyone who appreciates good film-making. if you're after an action-filled fiscal noisy ride then stay away. This is intelligent, thoughtful and brave film-making at its best and would go as far to say this is a masterpiece",8,0,1,27 June 2011
The Conjuring 2," Cor, blimey guvner, a sequel worth your sixpence piece!
","I remember being pretty disappointed when The Conjuring first came out. The Internet was building it up to be one of the scariest films ever made and I was getting really excited to be properly scared. I don't usually get scared in films, but James Wan's very own Insidious did manage to conjure up (pardon the pun) some genuinely terrifying imagery so I had every right to expect the same from The Conjuring but the film didn't scare me at all. It wasn't until I re-watched it recently that I realised that whilst it isn't a scary film to me, I can appreciate it for being a very well-made horror film.So when The Conjuring 2 reviews came out and were citing similar hype, I tried to put aside the claims of it being even better than the first film and went in with an open mind, almost expecting it to be a disappointment, but it wasn't. The Conjuring 2 is one of those very rare sequels (even rarer in the horror genre) which manages to better the first. It still has its problems and I still don't think it's scary or that it outdoes Insidious, but it is a fine example of haunted house horror which can stand proudly on its own.You'd be forgiven for thinking that it's simply more of the same when the film starts as it's almost identical to the first film. A seemingly unrelated case opens the film and the title flashes up on the screen along with some jargon about the film being true and this case is yet again the scariest The Warrens' have ever encountered blah blah blah. It's basic scare tactics that might work for horror virgins but us aficionados will just be rolling our eyes. To be fair, the opening scene is actually very well directed and gives you some idea of the film's overall quality. We're soon plunged into 1970's England and we're given constant reminders of this which is something that irritated me. Maybe it's because I'm English myself but the stereotypes were often quite overwhelming, although amusing. Every car in the driveway is a Mini Cooper, The Queen often pops up on the telly and everyone has a seriously strong cockney accent. I know that it's set in London but even so it sounds like most of the actors have moulded their accents on Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. I also found Frances O Connor a little wooden and unconvincing at times as well as a few of the kids.Overall the acting is terrific though. I was particularly impressed with Madison Wolfe as Margaret, the main girl, who gave off Linda Blair vibes at times. The role asks a lot of such a young actress but she tackles it head on and it's pretty extraordinary to watch. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are also as excellent as ever as our favourite paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. I really liked how the film focused so much on their relationship so that it became the emotional core of the film. Similarly, Wan takes his time to carefully build the characters in England so that we become invested in them and actually care about what's going to happen to them. It's such a rarity these days to find a horror film with characters you feel involved with and this is the main aspect which makes The Conjuring 2 so strong and compelling.The other great thing about the film is its atmosphere. James Wan clearly has a deep love for the horror genre and The Conjuring 2 is a labour of this love. The whole film is deliciously Gothic and over-the-top, it's a horror fan's dream come true. There are a lot of spooky scenes crammed into the film and whilst they didn't particularly scare me, you can't help but appreciate the stylishness and effectiveness of them. James Wan really is a master behind the camera and knows how to create genuine tension. Like the first film, a lot of scenes are filmed skilfully in one fluid take and it often becomes very intense, especially combined with the striking loud score and sound design.Even the typical horror clichés like possession and creaky doors are done in such an effective way that you don't care that you've seen it a hundred times before. With a running time of over two hours, I was still left feeling eager for more. The Conjuring 2 creates a gorgeous world of horror and allows you to sink within it. It will leave horror fans consistently grinning from ear to ear. The demon/ghost designs in this one are also much more creative than the first film. The nun character (played by the same lady who acted as the iconic bum in Mulholland Dr) was memorably creepy and a bizarre character known as the crooked man is weirdly delightful, although some might find him a jarringly out of place.If you're a fan of the horror genre then I can't really see any reason for disliking The Conjuring 2, and if you're not a horror fan then what are you bloody doing watching a horror film? Recent films like The Witch, It Follows and The Babadook may be better but that doesn't make The Conjuring 2 obsolete. It's a beautifully crafted piece of supernatural horror which delivers atmosphere and suspense in spades. Some of it does feel a little contrived towards the end but the finale's so excitingly pulse-pounding and intense that you're unlikely to care. It makes sure that the audience actually care about the people on screen so it's never dull for one moment. A third film will definitely be on the cards and if it carries on being as solid as this one then we might be looking at the best supernatural horror franchise since... Well, ever.Read more reviews at www.moviesplusmadness.wordpress.com",8,1,3,14 June 2016
District 9," Get yourself as many tins of cat food to see this sensational gem!
","Please don't be put off by the fact that this is a sci-fi film about aliens. Of course if you do happen to be a complete sci-fi boff then you won't need telling twice to go down and see this, because you've probably spent your whole life trying to find that next great alien invasion films. And here it is. But, I hate sci-fi films, especially those with stupid aliens in them because you just can't take them seriously. Alien films are often a load of rubbish as well unless you're looking at family-orientated ones like 'ET' or 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. But, adult alien films (don't!) are often bad or just don't get it right like 'Signs' which turned out to be really naff. So when I heard the hype surrounding 'District 9' I looked at the trailer and thought, 'This looks like complete tripe!' But when I saw it Asda for a fiver, all I could see was the raving reviews from pretty much everybody! Even Chris Tookey and Chutch claimed to adore it, so in the basket it went.I wasn't expecting much, but what I did get was something phenomenal. I've now seen it three times and each time it's still managed to leave me breathless. 'District 9' isn't your ordinary alien invasion film, or at least it doesn't seem like it. It's a complete masterpiece from start to finish. Neil (the director) plunges you straight into this alien world from the very first frame and its impossible not to get seduced by it. Everything's told using a 'mouckumentary' if you like, and it's really clever and sometimes weirdly believable. Maybe, it's because of the fantastic parallels concerning today's society and apartheid? The opening comes thick and fast and immediately grabs the viewer and pulls them in to the world of Johannesburg but not as we know it. I think that truly great films should make the viewer fell like they're their and not actually watching something on the telly. Films like 'Black Swan' and 'The Artist' have done this to me, and also 'District 9'.The film also seamlessly transitions from a sort of found-footage stroke 'mouckumentary' and actual film. I suppose you could sort of look at the camera crew following the main character, Wikus, as a metaphor, of the humans seeing the aliens through lenses that aren't don't show the aliens truthfully, then when we're transported into the world we see what is really happening with the aliens, and we get the frustrating truth. It's a film that 'Avatar' wanted to be, only 'District 9' is one hundred million times better than 'Avatar'! It explores themes about apartheid and treating people right without shoving it down your throat in a patronising way. It's extremely poignant and handled beautifully. When Wikus ends up becoming friends with one of the aliens it's extremely touching and you end up caring for both of them.That's another great thing about 'District 9' it has fantastic characters. I'm sure if this got a Hollywood re-do then they would make the character of Wikus as someone who has no flaws, a bit like the paraplegic man in 'Avatar'. Some sort of hero who knows exactly what he's doing. Whereas here, Wikus is the definition of a lovable tw*t. He isn't at all perfect but he has such a kind heart and is good-natured. It's only until he knows how it feels to be an outsider that he really starts to understand these aliens. He's a complete idiot and the film does have some really funny moments, although it does help with him having a south-African accent as some how everything they say just sounds so much funnier! The aliens are also in most aspects, more human than the humans, and you really want them to succeed, especially with that incredibly adorable baby alien!'District 9' is not just only superbly written but also fabulously directed. It's fast-paced and the final third or so of the film is just complete non-stop exciting action that is just handled beautifully. Oh, and I'm not talking stupid, pointless action where the director decides that it would be better to just blow up something to make it look cooler (hello Michael Bay). No, this is action with a point. The characters have a motive and its a motive that you really want them to succeed with. It's breath-taking to watch and the special effects are literally out of this world! It's like the end of 'Avatar' only much more exciting because the characters are so much more likable (and some appropriately unlikable). It also manages to take itself seriously without making it look ridiculous. That might be because it managed to poke fun at itself at the start which was also refreshing to see. It's brilliant.So whatever your view is on aliens, get down to your nearest supermarket (or maybe there's a nice cheap one on 'Amazon' or 'Ebay'!) and buy it! Because this isn't just a film about aliens, it's a film about people and I think that's the point. You see the aliens and think 'Oh god, here we go!' but as the film goes on you see them as people too. The cinematography is also sometimes breath-taking, especially with those iconic shots of that incredible mothership, which really must've been a spectacle to see at the cinema! 'District 9' is a shot of adrenaline, straight into the heart and I didn't want it end.",10,4,6,12 April 2012
Batman Begins," Sorry Tim, but this is THE Batman film!
","I'm not very keen on superhero films, I think they're a bit naff, going around in costumes and fighting some crazy camp villain, I think it's all a bit geeky and bizarre for me. But, in 'Batman Begins' Christopher Nolan has taken the story, demolished it and rebuilt it to be a deliciously dark, breathtaking, 'adult Batman' that is more of a gangster action film than a child's superhero film.I wasn't expecting to be blown the way, quite like I did because like I said, I don't like superheroes. The opening basically took me in and it didn't let go from there, because we've got an epic film that I didn't want to end! The screenplay really is top-notch, creating a believable background history on a so called superhero that is more of a masked vigilante, because he doesn't have any toxic powers, he can't make his chin blow up or anything weird like that (can any superhero do that?) Bruce Wayne is actually a believable character and his vengeance is what drives this film on in a breathtaking pace.So we get the back story plus an excellent main storyline. That's one tick in the box, and the next tick must go to the pacing and action sequences. It is the action sequences that got me on the edge of my seat. The highlight for me being the car chase through Gotham, Christopher Nolan can shoot action like Quentin Tarantino. It's pacey, it's exciting and everything you could ever want in an action film. The climax is something truly spectacular.Here's me thinking that Batman was for kiddies! This is much more of an adult film, it's super cool and very dark. The storyline isn't a simple good vs evil, it's complicated and even I got confused! I really like how Nolan has taken the villain in the comic (here it's the scarecrow) and he finds a way to make it seem believable by creating some really evil, sadistic character that isn't that camp at all.But what limits 'Batman Begins' from being a perfect 5 star film is the performance given by the unlikable, uncharismatic Christian Bale. He is so wooden as Batman, 'I'm Batman' he says with a face as miserable as sin. I truly believe he is miscast here and it's a shame because Michael Caine is really great as the butler, Cillian Murphey makes a menacing villain and Arthur Schindler (can't remember his real name... LIAM NEESON! That's the one!) is really superb as his mentor. But, Christian Bale lets the side down once again and is unfortunately meant to be the main character here. Whoops.But forget Christian. Here we really do have a superb film. It's exciting, it's cool, it's high concept and I loved it!*NOTE- After recently watching 'Batman Begins' again, I did actually really like Christian Bale as Batman. I thought he suited the role perfectly. I don't know what I was on before!",9,1,2,12 June 2011
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," If you go down to the woods today be sure for a big surprise!
","If truth be told, I didn't think that I was going to like Tucker & Dale Vs Evil. I remember seeing the trailer and thinking that it looked like a dumb and forced horror comedy in the vein of Scary Movie. However, I had heard a lot of positive reviews so I thought that I'd give it a go. The opening was a little lame and then we get introduced to some truly horrendous characters who are obviously played for laughs. I was beginning to lose faith, right up until Tucker and Dale were introduced.For some reason I thought that the film was about two dumb redneck psychopaths killing some teens. However, what makes the film so clever, unique and funny is that it's not about that at all. Instead it's about two lovable rednecks who get themselves into a lot of farcical situations by mistake. You could hardly call it a slasher film. It's more like a horror romcom with a feel good ending to die for.I laughed throughout Tucker and Dale. It reminded me of Hatchet, only this is far better and funnier, and I really like Hatchet for the record! I watched this on my own and found myself laughing out loud and quite hard too! It reminded me of Miranda sometimes in how everything builds from one misunderstanding to another. The plot is really stupid, but the film knows that and it plays with it in a very clever way offering plenty of sly nods to horror fans who are all too familiar with these types of plots.What makes the film though is it's brilliant characters. You can't help but fall in love with Dale who's so kind and self-depreciating. He's completely different to Tucker who's louder and more amoral, but this makes their relationship that much sweeter. I also loved Allison, the slasher character who normally stays as the drop-dead-gorgeous girl at the back and gets killed quite early on, who turns out to be a sweet and very likable main girl. The rest of the college kids are disposable but purposefully so, apart from the hugely dislikeable psychopath, Chad.Most of all though Tucker and Dale is just bloody good fun to watch. It's a great film to watch with some friends round. It doesn't take itself seriously, but it does take itself seriously enough to give us an endlessly witty and intelligent screenplay, lovable characters and just an all-round good quality film. Some scenes are also really heartfelt which I wasn't expecting. I also loved the infectiously feel good ending which left me grinning ear to ear. This film was such a wonderful surprise to me. I was really expecting to dislike it, but now it's probably one of my favourite horror-comedies. Give it a chance. Only the most stone-hearted person with no sense of humour could hate this.",8,1,2,11 September 2014
Foxcatcher," Chilling drama which soars like an eagle!
","Foxcatcher has the absorbing coldness of a film by Michael Haneke. I had zero interest when I read that it was about Olympic wrestling, however my interest was lighted when I saw the sinister trailer for the film and found out that it was in fact a psychological drama and not some sort of rites-of-passage sports movie. Unfortunately, I did read about the ending and started kicking myself when many critics recommended reading nothing on the true story. So although the ending was no surprise to me, it was still pretty shocking.However, there's much more to admire about the film than its tragic finale. A lot of people have called the film too slow and boring, and whilst it is very slow paced, I never found it boring for a moment. People who find this film boring would probably end up committing suicide if they put themselves through something like Uzak! I did think that it was longer than it needed to be, but it wasn't much of a detraction. Apparently, the original rough cut was almost 4 hours long so the editors have done well to whittle it down to a trim 130 minutes.The beginning of the film perfectly illustrates the lonely existence of wrestler, Mark Schultz. The shots are long, uninterrupted and the lighting is dim. Mark existence is based purely around wrestling as he lacks any sort of social life. His brother is his only friend and even he isn't that friendly towards him. Things change when similarly socially inept, John Du Pont invites him over to his mansion and asks to join his wrestling team and train for the Olympics.There's a thick foreboding atmosphere which penetrates throughout the film. A lot of the sinister edge comes from Steve Carell's outstanding portrayal of wrestling and bird enthusiast, John Du Pont. He's almost unrecognisable with his gigantic prosthetic nose which could outdo Katie Hopkins! He doesn't look, sound or act all that human. There's an otherworldly quality to him and you can't help but become completely absorbed whenever he's on screen. He's an unpredictable character who always remains compelling. The maniacal end scene urged me to find out more about the true life case.I was also impressed with Channing Tatum, who is normally cast as the pretty boy in rom-coms. His performance is pretty intense and a large amount of method acting was involved too. Apparently when he smashed his head on the mirror it was completely improvised! Mark Ruffalo didn't impress me quite as much but he still held his own. Really it's Steve's show and you'll go away from the film with his haunting performance in your mind.Foxcatcher is a supremely creepy and atmospheric film. It's a character and relationship study. Watching John and Mark become friends is quietly gripping. Their fallout is all the more interesting. It's beautifully directed and its quiet surrealism adds to the film's sinister atmosphere. Perhaps it's a little too slow for mass audiences, but fans of Michael Haneke and Paul Thomas Anderson will undoubtedly find a lot to like. I know that I did!",9,5,9,18 February 2015
It Follows," A horror masterclass
","I'm a pretty hardened horror movie watcher. Very little gets under my skin these days, for example I can quite comfortably sit and watch The Exorcist on my own, in the middle of the night and not feel a teeny weeny bit frightened. Whilst all the kids were losing their heads over The Conjuring, I sat there completely stone-faced, although that could be something to do with the crap cinema I saw it at in Loughborough which had a screen the size of a microwave. The last film to properly scare me was Sleepaway Camp, but that's only because of THAT ending Perhaps I'm not as hardened as I make out though. There have been a few recent horror films which have given me some genuine chills: Kill List, Sinister and The Babadook have all unsettled me greatly. It Follows can also be added to that list.I watched It Follows alone last night and once it had finished I ran off to bed with chills tingling along my back, hopped straight into bed and threw the covers over my head like a 14 year-old girl. It's something I've not done for a while, but It Follows really got under my skin! It's been at the top of my watch list for a while after the buzz it created at all the festivals last year. Once it hit a wider release, all of the critics were raving at how brilliant it was and how it was the scariest film to come out in a decade. It Follows quickly fell into what I call the hype machine. The trouble with this is that you often let your expectations rocket to impossible heights which ends up in massive disappointment.I allowed the hype to die down (and for the blu-ray to become cheaper!) and gave it a watch with lower expectations, and it worked! It's easy to see how many were disappointed when people were calling it the new Halloween and a new horror classic. I wouldn't quite go that far, but in an age full of horrendously conventional horror films with bad acting, super-fast editing and unoriginal ideas; It Follows stands head and shoulders above the rest as the superior animal. It grabbed my attention right from the opening shot which is done all in one long take. There's no shaky camera and no cutting away every two seconds, it's just one long shot of a girl running away in a panic. It feels grounded, real and completely refreshing. The incredibly cool retro synth score doesn't do it any trouble either! David Robert Mitchell is clearly someone who knows what he's doing behind the camera. The opening also culminates in a jarringly haunting image which feels like something from a nightmare. It Follows means business from the start.We then follow our hero, Jay who's a blameless young adult going about her normal boring life until she decides to do a bit of innocent dogging. It results in her being cursed like a girl from Japan, but instead of a long black-haired figure following her, it's an invisible demon. It's an incredibly simple premise to pad out into a 100 minute feature film, but it absolutely works. Every single scene is filled with a strong atmosphere of complete dread because you never know when the demon is going to return, or what form it's going to take. Even scenes where Jay and her friends are sat talking are suspenseful because you can feel a presence. Someone is always watching and it makes for a nightmarish experience.When the stalking demon appears, that's when stuff gets real. The film reaches its most terrifying peak when Jay and her friends stay up all night at her house to watch out for spooky happenings. I don't want to spoil it for those who are yet to see the film, but suffice to say that it has a couple of seriously nightmarish images that will stay with me for quite a long time. It's masterfully executed to squeeze out the maximum scares possible. It's scary in the same way Kairo (Pulse) was. Rather than generating quick jump scares, the imagery slowly creeps under your skin and sends sharp chills all the way up your spine. It's truly a spine-tingling experience, or at least it was for me!Throughout the whole film you're basically waiting for the demon to make another appearance and because you don't know when that's going to be the film was never boring for me. The film does lean towards the art-house side, so those not familiar with arty, slow stuff might find it a little tedious. It's not the kind of film you can dip in and out of with your phone and just watch when 'something happens'. It Follows requires your full attention for it to really work.It's not quite perfect though. I have to admit that although the group of characters were likable, I did find them flat. They don't really say a lot and at one point I was thinking that they could possibly be the most boring group of people you could ever hang out with! Also, I found Maika Monroe, who plays main girl, Jay distractingly attractive. I know it's my fault for being a hormonal young man but at times when I should've been completely focused on the film, I was distracted by how drop-dead gorgeous she is! She also flashed a lot of flesh which didn't help the situation. She's in a swimming costume for the thrilling finale for gawd's sake! In all seriousness though, It Follows is a modern horror master-class. It's flawlessly executed and feels refreshing and original. It's also genuinely terrifying for once! I won't use the old cliché by saying 'it's the scariest film in years' because lots of scary films pop up every year if you look hard enough. I'd say it's the best horror film to come out since Babadook.",9,5,16,23 September 2015
Django Unchained," The best Western ever!
","Quentin Tarantino has made some dastardly good films. Kill Bill Vol.1 remains one of my all time favourite films, Pulp Fiction is a captivating classic, Inglorious Basterds is one hell of a gem and Kill Bill Vol.2 is too. When I heard that Quentin was going to doing a spaghetti western I was extremely positive about the idea, despite not having a great taste for the Western genre. The idea of a Quentin Western was very attractive, and his style and writing skills looked as though they could perfectly fit the part of a Western. It turns out that all my feelings were right! For Quentin has created one of the best films I've seen, and certainly the best Western I've seen which makes Clint Eastwood's, Unforgiven look like Bratz: The Movie! (And I really liked Unforgiven).Before the film even starts we get a taste of all the things we love about Quentin, as the Columbia logo is made to look retro. We then get some great pastiche titles over some terrific shots of a chain of slaves walking across the desert and into a forest. Of course we are then graced by the devastating presence of Christoph Waltz, who has a humorously over-sized tooth on his dentist waggon. Christoph gives us yet again another impeccable performance as our bounty-hunter hero, proving that he can make as good a hero as his wonderful villain in Inglorious Basterds.The first sequence is gloriously engaging and entertaining, as we delve right into the plot with Christoph buying Django straight away, and of course it's not quite that simple... From then on we have a string of compelling moments as we watch the pair, who make a marvellous, funny and often touching double act, go on a bounty hunt with some of it even for revenge, which is a theme I'm very keen on! However, things get kicked up another notch when Django and Shultz decide to go and rescue Django's wife who's been kidnapped by the deliriously evil, Calvin Candie (what a great name!)Leonardo Di Caprio puts on a great performance as Calvin, who appears sneaky and calculated, like all the best villains. However, Leo does take a terrifyingly intense turn when Calvin gets angry! It's a pretty intense sequence where Leo actually does draw real blood! Now that's some powerful acting. Of course, the dialogue is tight and suspenseful and hopefully Quentin is pretty much guaranteed to win the Oscar for best original screenplay. The film is packed full of tension when the duo are with Calvin, and the suspense only rises at dinner-time which escalates into exactly the wild west shootout I was hoping for.There's a sequence that is almost matching of Kill Bill Vol.1 where there's gallons of blood flying around! It's madly entertaining to watch and possibly one of the greatest scenes ever! Quentin has created two brilliant heroes who we can root for and care about. The flashback sequences with Django and his wife really involves you in the story, and some of them are rather emotional. I was almost as filled as much rage as Django when he first saw his wife being ill-treated, and just like Kill Bill I couldn't wait to see Django and Shultz exact revenge. Think of it as Kill Kandie! Samuel L Jackson is also brilliant as Candie's servant, he's often hilarious and also very nasty, which sums up Django Unchained! The film is often really funny, with the idiotic Ku Klux Klan being a comedy highlight. The production designs are also breath-taking, especially Candieland's rich set.Whilst Quentin's films can be a tad dialogue heavy, Django Unchained seems to find the right balance between talking and action. The action often arrives thick and fast and surprisingly. Also, the dialogue isn't that much of a chore to watch either, because it's so brilliantly written and full of suspense like the bar scene in Inglourious Basterds. But Django Unchained is even better than Inglourious Basterds! Its a Western with a difference, full of great characters, stupendous screenplay and knock-out directing.It's outrageous that Quentin isn't up for best director! Django Unchained looks amazing. It's a film that you can watch numerous times, as the film flows perfectly. There's one point when I thought that it was going to end, but it actually carried on for another half an hour or so, and it was great! Django Unchained is a triumph. It starts off amazing and doesn't let up, in fact it becomes more and more compelling as the film goes on. And at 2hrs 45mins the film surprisingly rarely drags! It really doesn't feel that long, but time flies when you're having fun and Django is a lot of fun!",10,1,4,14 February 2013
Get Out," Get in
","It's been about one whole year since Jordan Peele's Get Out was unleased onto cinemas and I've only just managed to see it! I call myself a seasoned horror fan but why on Earth did it take me so long to see a four-time Oscar nominated horror film? You know it has to be special when the Academy (who famously shun all genre movies) consider giving it a gong for Best Picture. After all, Get Out is the first all-out horror film to be nominated in the category since The Exorcist in 1973. Unless you decide to count the likes of Black Swan and The Silence of the Lambs which have elements of horror but are no where near as obvious as this film.Is it all that superior then? Personally I think we've seen better recently in films such as The Witch and It Follows, but there's no denying that it's a cut above the rest. It's certainly far more intelligent than most films nowadays, which the Academy miraculously realised after awarding it an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay last night. It follows black British star Daniel Kaluuya as he goes to meet his white girlfriend's parents at their large middle-class home. Everything seems fine a first but gradually things start to take a sinister turn as some very white guests arrive and seem to almost close in on our black hero. To say anything else would be to ruin the terrific surprises in store, I went in knowing almost nothing about the plot and was certainly all the better for it.Get Out takes a simple horror movie premise and turns it into a thoughtful and scarily plausible satire about racism. What's nice is that it doesn't shove it down our throats in a ham-fisted way like say, Mother! (which I loved, I must say) but there's stuff for keener viewers to dig in to. It never patronises its audience and is always interested in building up a sense of paranoia and suspense around a likable protagonist who we can all root for. It also manages to provide an exciting third act which manages to satisfy and thrill in equal measure.It's difficult to believe that this is Jordan Peele's debut film. The technical competence is pretty outstanding, although he has had plenty of experience starring in film and TV before so he must've learned something about being behind the camera whilst being in front of it! He shows great flair and vision behind the camera, always remaining focused and expertly building tension. Where most directors would go in for the heavy-handed approach, Peele uses subtlety and restraint. Even the barmy revelation is presented with such confidence, that you don't doubt the logic for a second.Get Out might not be the ground-breaking classic you were hoping for, but it's certainly a fine horror film with enough comedy to comfortably cleanse your pallet. Despite always having its tongue in cheek, it carries an important message about liberal racism and does an excellent job at making the audience feel what it's like to be a black man in modern America. The ending perhaps could've been less predictable and convenient, but Get Out offers plenty of hidden riches in repeated viewings.",8,17,34,5 March 2018
Drive," Drove me the right way
","I wasn't really too sure with what to expect with Drive. People were calling it an incredibly slow art-house movie, which I don't mind at all, I'm quite fond of the odd good art-house movie e.g. 'We Need To Talk About Kevin' is a firm favourite of mine. I also had high expectations however, as a lot of people were raving about it like it was the greatest achievement of film ever! So I went in with an open mind and found myself being very fond of it. Drive is a film which I shall definitely give a second run around the block again.Drive opens fantastically! It perfectly captures the dangers of being a get-away driver. It's a thrilling chase scene with Ryan Gosling trying to evade the police and is beautifully shot. It tries to rely more on realism than go for the cheap quick-cut and shaky-cam thrills which the Fast and the Furious franchise aims to deliver. Drive takes a slower pace and has much more of an interest in character than action, which is a good thing to me. The slow direction perfectly conveys the loneliness of Ryan Gosling, but also shows that he's in control. He's a severely calm and methodical person, who you wouldn't really like to get on the wrong side with.The main show in Drive is the near-perfect directing, cinematography and lighting. Drive is a master-class in these elements as it's obvious that every shot was set up with great care and precision. There's not one piece of lighting out of place and the cinematography is quite astounding at times. It's incredibly easy on the eyes and carries a very cool charm with it. I loved the realism of the film and the shocking violence was used with reason, and almost reminiscent of a Haneke film, with short and shocking bursts of extreme violence. However, like Goodfellas, it is used to show the nasty and unglamourous side of the mob industry.I also really liked the love story told. There's some chemistry between Ryan and Carey, and although they don't really say a lot to each other, the connection between them is definitely there. Things between to hot up when Carey's husband is released from jail and things take quite an unpredictable turn for the worst. The final half hour or so may be slow, but it is still undeniably thrilling and realistic. There a some beautifully shot sequences that will stay with me for a long time. The finale is also very gripping, and you care about the characters involved.Overall, there's something about Drive that makes it unique and different to other films. It has certainly got under my skin and is an experience I shall look forward to again. The soundtrack perfectly engulfs the retro feel of the film and the directing is almost as stylish as Tarantino. Lovers of dialogue may be disappointed but there is certainly more dialogue than what some people say. I was expecting a film like 'Hunger' where nothing's said for what feels like an hour, until a non-stop 15 minute talk-fest! Drive is nothing like that. It just takes a somewhat different and unconventional approach from the average Hollywood production. Drive's a film of quality and one I won't be forgetting in a hurry!",8,3,4,11 January 2013
Insidious," It felt like I had an outer body experience!
","*Minor spoilers* I was expecting to like 'Insidious', I heard how scary it was and after seeing many 'scary' films that actually failed to scare me. I was ready to be genuinely scared by 'Insidious'. And guess what? I loved every minute of it! Right from the really creepy opening I knew I was in for a pretty creepy experience. There are several sequences in this film that actually are genuinely scary and most of is down to James Wan's fantastic directing. Mr Wan knows how to make something creepy. He allows the audience to follow every bit of camera movement, making every shock count. There is something very unsettling about a camera sweeping through a hallway slowly. It's almost as if you are there and you know that something is going to come out to shock you.The acting is also very good for a horror film. Barbara Hershey manages to impress again, like in 'Black Swan' (only not quite as impressive as that) and there were some characters there that we could all care about.My only complaint would be that the granny should've been the main demon villain. I don't feel that there was any need for the red faced bloke, he was no where near as terrifying as that granny! I think that it confused the story and he ended up being a bit naff.But the final moments in 'Insidious' are really tense, edge-of-your-seat stuff. It turns out to be frightening fun and an excellent experience in the cinema. I think the effect would unfortunately crisp on the small screen, so I do feel it's important to see this in the cinema.What I really liked in 'Insidious' was the fantastic music! It was a throwback to those 70's/80's ghosty films in the way 'Drag Me To Hell' did with its music. It blew me away to hear it in the cinema, and I got a chill whenever something popped up with that dissident/atonal music. It is brilliant!'Insidious' is an updated 'Poultergeist'. It's filled with genuinely scary, creepy and terrifying moments. There are some images in there that will scare the hell out of you! If you're willing to go on with the storyline and accept all the supernatural farce then you will find yourself in for a fantastic ride!",9,6,11,8 May 2011
The Lives of Others," You'll be watching it like the Stasi!
","Films like 'The Lives of Others' don't come around very often, as the film industry is dominated by loud Hollywood blockbusters with no real substance (Helena Bonham Carter would agree with me :) this, an overlooked film because it's foreign and quieter than dominating films, deserves a much wider audience. Anyone could watch 'The Lives of Others' and be touched and perhaps moved by the wonderful acting and deeply drawn out characters (unless you're under 5, but we'll let you off!)If you appreciate fine acting, this is a great film to watch. Because in foreign films you can't understand what they're saying (generally) I usually find it difficult to tell if they're acting well or not, but in 'The Lives of Others' you can tell that they're delivery and performance is fantastic. Right down to the main characters walk! It also helps it to flesh out the wonderfully drawn characters. They're in-depth and you find yourself being emotionally attached to them as the Stasi man watching them! You increasingly want to see more of them making for truly compelling viewing!The directing also adds to how compelling the film is. It's very delicate and clever in the way he tries only to show the couple in the way Wiesler also sees them, so when his shift is over, we as an audience also stop seeing the family which helps us to understand how Wiesler is so compelled with their lives and also makes it exceedingly gripping! Although, I think that the directing could've afforded to be more intense than it was, but that's only a small flaw.The writing is incredibly intelligent and also gives you good insight to the split Germany before the Berlin wall came down. It's interesting and moving with a very touching ending. The screenplay also doesn't fear about delving deeply into the characters either. It's full of excellent characterisation and brings up some delicate themes in the correct manner.'The Lives of Others' is a truly masterful film, every element that makes a classic film comes together perfectly. I can bet that in 50 years time 'The Lives of Others' will still be watched and cherished. It's just a shame it doesn't get the recognition it deserves! Even if you don't feel that 'The Lives of Others' isn't your thing, please just give it a go and I bet that'll you'll be moved and compelled by the experience. A must see!",9,5,5,16 August 2011
The Mist," Primeval with the cast from the Walking Dead
","Of course I'm joking with that above statement! For those of you who don't know, Primeval is an incredibly bad TV show in the UK about dinosaurs that come out of worm hole thingies and a bumbling group of secret service people go out to dispatch of the beasts humanely. It's really bad, uses every cliché in the book and has most definitely run its course. The Mist surprised me, although I wouldn't call it one the greatest horror films of the decade, it's certainly one of the greatest creature features, but I could think of at least 20 horror films (I think) that are better than this one that came out between the years 2000 and 2010.The Mist is sort of like a very well-made B-movie, and I mean that in the nicest possible way. We all know what happens, a bunch of people get trapped in a supermarket as a dangerously thick mist engulfs the town. It would be stupid to leave anyway because you could'nt see where you're going, but it would be even more stupid to leave after Dale from the Walking Dead (beardless!) runs in screaming that there's something in the mist which took someone! Everyone's sceptical, but a few more people are not when they get a rather nasty surprise in the store room! Some people may completely disregard The Mist as being silly, but these people simply do not know how to have fun. Who can't say they weren't entertained when the supermarket was stormed with giant mutant fly things?Besides, The Mist offers so much more than a standard creature feature. It's a comment on humanity and the state of today's society. Immediately the supermarket is segregated into different groups of race, religion and hierarchy. It's the wonderful screenplay that's the real star of the show, giving a fascinating insight into how people could and probably would act in such a situation. It's almost reminiscent of George A Romero's Dawn of the Dead or/and Day of the Dead. There's some wonderful characters who you can either root for or wish for them to get eaten (*cough* *cough* Bible nut *cough*) it's the relationships between people which mean that there's rarely a dull moment in The Mist's two hour running time. Although, I did feel that it was perhaps over-long and some of the dialogue scenes could've been reduced or cut out completely.The directing is quite stylish and sometimes feels very candid, which gives the film a needed realistic edge. The CGI effects could annoy some people as they were a bit iffy at times (not as bad as Primeval!) but they're certainly not the worst effects I've seen, and they didn't distract from the film itself. Some of the beasties were quite nasty-looking and the huge ones, covered by the mist had a particularly eerie edge. I could'nt imagine (nor want to imagine) what I'd be like in that situation. I'd probably be in a corner shipping myself! There's quite a lot of beast action and it is wonderfully entertaining and refreshingly unpretentious.Now, the ending wasn't as mind-blowingly shocking as most people were making out. I'd say that the endings to say, 5150 Elm's Way and Eden Lake are in respects more shocking, nevertheless for an American horror film it certainly had balls! I did really like the ending, it was unrelentlessly nasty and painfully ironic and haunting, but I would've probably liked it even more if it was less hyped up. It'll certainly put the less-experienced American viewer out of their comfort zone!In the end The Mist is a hugely enjoyable creature feature with a hefty/heavy focus on people and characters. It's probably better than I imagined it to be and is much better than the disappointing Stephen King adaptation of 1408. Whilst it isn't up there with Carrie, The Shining and Misery, it can still sit in the 'very good' category of Stephen King horror adaptations. I really enjoyed it and people who say they didn't probably secretly enjoyed it too! I would recommend that you see it, but I think that most people have seen it by now! Still, if you haven't it's worth seeking out, I found it very cheaply on Amazon, and I could see it as the type of film that would get better with repeated viewings!",8,2,4,5 January 2013
Kick-Ass," Kicked arse
","I wasn't expecting to like 'Kick-ass'. Why did you buy it then? I hear you cry! Well, because 'Stella' was doing this fantastic offer where you can choose from 40 DVD's and get one for the price of a text (which is only 10p or so woohoo! P.S. There are other great alcoholic beverages apart from 'Stella'). So I thought ooh, I'll try this one even though I'm probably going to absolutely hate it even though loads of people say it's great. It turns out that I absolutely loved it and by the end of it I was quoting Lynne, 'FANTASTIC, LOVED IT! LOVED IT!' Whilst nodding my body like one of those desktop bird things. Anyway, you won't know what I'm on about because I don't even know myself.Now I've rabbited on for a whole paragraph about nothing really so let's get on to the film. I was scared that i wasn't going to like it because A. I don't like superheroes, B. It's in-your-face awkward yanky humour that's portrayed on the TV spots won't be to my taste C. I hate comic adaptations (hello 'Watchmen') and D. Nicholos Cage is in it. Thankfully all of these letters were not a problem one bit. 'Kick-ass' should be commended for its inability to portray something that seems completely believable but at the same time be incredibly outrageous, like 'The human Centipede 2'. I was really impressed with how gorgeously the film was written (by Johanathan Woss' wife no less, she's obviously got more talent than him... Bloody busy body) it had a fantastic story to tell which blends humour, action and brilliant characters almost perfectly.'Kick-ass' was also exactly my humour. As soon as Nicholas Cage shot his daughter in the chest I knew this film was going to be fine-diddly-ine. 'Kick-ass' is really funny at times, and most importantly at the appropriate times. It keeps it's entertaining story and action sequences separate from the humour so that it doesn't become too over-powering and interferes with the story.'Kick-ass' did kind of seem reminiscent of 'Watchmen', it's almost as if this is what 'Watchmen' should've been. Because whereas 'Watchmen' is a dreary, pathetic yarn which takes itself way, way, way too seriously. 'Kick-ass' is an hour and 50 minutes of pure entertainment, it's never boring and is always engaging and exciting. i really didn't want it to end with it's incredible action sequences and brilliantly drawn characters. The directing was really impressive and almost Quentin Tarantino-esque as it did have that 'Kill Bill' kind of quality to it.'Kick-ass' may also seem very kiddish on the cover but please don't let this anywhere near young viewers. It really doesn't hold back on its insane violence and profanity's. 'Kick-ass' did get a hard time in the press because of Hitgirl who's basically a mini Uma Thurman from 'Kill Bill'. They didn't think it was appropriate to let a child swear and assassinate so many people, but you know what? It's all a bit of fun, and people should open there eyes and not take life quite so seriously.Like I said, 'Kick-ass' is the complete opposite to what i thought it would be. I never thought that I'd be sitting here giving it a 10/10 and glowing report. It is perfect in a way. It's directed brilliantly, written fantastically, it has a fabulous soundtrack as well as characters we can all care about. 'Kick-ass' is pure entertainment and is the ultimate experience in fun as well as having an interesting story put there. If you thought you'd never like it, give it a go.",9,3,7,28 September 2011
Moulin Rouge!," A sparkawing diamond!
","Now I understand that some people simply won't 'get' 'Moulin Rouge' as it is the definition of a marmite film. You will either completely hate everything about it or absolutely love it and watch it all the time. Unfortunately for me I'm the latter half, I love 'Moulin Rouge' and although slightly flawed, I still have to give a complete 10 out of 10 just simply for its uniqueness and watch-ability factor. Heres more reasons why I love it.The story itself is very simple and text-book for a romantic musical. It's very similar to Baz's version of 'Romeo + Juliet' because it's about forbidden love. However believe or not, 'Moulin Rouge' has even more style and is 10x more outrageous and fun! What it lacks in complexity it gains in sheer originality. The first thing that will strike anyone is the incredible visuals that Baz puts in from the very start. It looks absolutely amazing and is a masterclass in how to use sight and sound. The cinematography is really top-notch and awe-inspiring. this is why blu-ray was invented!Baz's directing is outstanding! The first 20 minutes or so are incredibly fast-paced and may put some people off, but it's important to keep with it because it does slow down a little. Everything is completely put on top gear and it's brilliant! The way the film uses modern day songs for a late 1800's style setting is pure genius, and you just get really into the songs and the music. 'Moulin Rouge' could be described as one long music video which may put some people off. But not me! The film is also really funny as well and uses slapstick cartoonish humour to motor along lovely. Richard Roxborough (not sure how to spell it) as The Duke was a delight, his rendition of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' has me in stitches every time! Jim Broadbeny as 'Ziddler' also impresses and goes brilliantly with the over the top style of the film. Let's make this clear that no one can actually sing. Ewan thinks he can get away with just shouting all the time and Nicole can't hit the high notes and usually gets away with it by fainting just before she hits them. But even so, you will find your spine tingling with the incredible music that bellows on the screen.The final scene is really inventive and always gives me chills. 'Moulin Rouge' will make you laugh and possibly make you cry (I didn't because I'm a big boy!) What's certain is that you will be singing along to all your favourite songs (even if it is in your head). 'Moulin Rouge' is best enjoyed with the sound cranked all the way up and probably best seen in blu-ray quality. Just open up your mind and enjoy the incredible visuals, directing and sound. If you watch it for the first time, there's a very strong chance that you will watch it at least 5 more times!",10,1,3,10 August 2011
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," It pushed my buttons
","I was actually expecting to hate Benjamin Button (the film not the character) but actually I ended up rather liking it, but not exactly loving it completely. To me it shows uncanny resemblances to Forrest Gump and is no where near that standard in my opinion.Let me start off with the cons. I really have to express my feelings towards the old woman, supposedly Cate Blanchett, at the start and throughout. Why? What is the point of her, everything she sad just made me burst into hysterics because she was just so inaudible. I literally couldn't understand a word she said. (Apart from a few). She is meant to be a dying woman and even sounds like she can hardly speak because she's so close to death's door, yet she ends up telling a 3 hour story! The whole sub-plot made me laugh with these pointless interludes that were as pointless as the old woman in 'Titanic', and at least I could understand her! Her strong southern accent would be hard enough to hear anyway, never mind a croaky, disjointed strong southern accent. 'Hello worse nightmare!'- Miranda.My other problem is the lack of life. The story is so eccentric and sometimes had mad-cap strokes that were really over the top, which is absolutely fine! It sometimes resembled the works of 'Amelie' yet lacked the life 'Amelie' had. I think that they should've taken it further, instead of making it so still like a gentle drama. 'Forrest gump' was also full of much more life than this.Don't get me wrong, 'Benjamin Butty' really did have strokes of genius and wonder. The script really is top-notch, as it visits a mans life and every aspect of it as he ages backward. The story is interesting and original and David Fincher shows some really fantastic directing and cinematography. 'Butty' really is a nice-looking film.The CGI effects were amazing, making Pitt look like an ancient old hag, to a boy-ish face. Cate Blanchett wasn't quite so convincing, she just looked like herself with a couple of lines drawn on her face. But you can't have it all.Overall, the film is actually really long but it doesn't feel that long at all. I was scared of getting bored, but I didn't thanks to the intriguing story, gorgeous cinematography and top-notch directing. However, I do feel it could've been just a little bit better and perhaps a little more... Crazy!",7,0,1,11 June 2011
Coco," Another brilliant film from Pixar? I should coco!
","Pixar needn't fear about entering the land of the dead after Coco dazzling audiences and critics alike. They've been teetering lately with their three most recent films (The Good Dinosaur, Finding Dory and Cars 3) all of which received relatively mixed reviews from a studio who have churned out more timeless animations than any other. Coco sees them back on top form though by emotionally weaving an engaging and constantly surprising story about family, love and loss.It follows a spirited Mexican lad called Miguel who wants nothing more than to be a musician. Unfortunately for him, his family are from a long line of music-haters after Miguel's great great great grandmother's husband left her and her daughter alone in order to pursue a career in music. Since then every child from the family has been raised to detest all kinds of music (as any sane family would do) which means Miguel has to tinkle his ivories in secret whilst worshipping his superstar musical idol, Ernesto De La Cruz. For reasons never quite explained, Miguel ends up in the Mexican land of the dead where a madcap adventure ensues, never failing to entertain along the way.Coco fools you initially by pretending to be a straightforward family adventure film with stunning visuals and cute characters, but a genuinely shocking third act twist reveals itself to be so much more. It's quite barmy how a film targeted for children is more unpredictable than the majority of films aimed at adults in this day and age. Nevertheless, this is Pixar and we all know that despite being family friendly, they're really made for adults!What makes the film so memorable though is its pure emotion. Pixar have been pulling at our heartstrings for years from the infamous opening of Up to the tragic demise of Bing Bong in Inside Out. I'm happy to say that Coco is no exception. I'm not one to cry in films but I must admit to being quite choked up several times in Coco, particularly in its closing moments. This isn't manipulative, sugary, trying-desperately-hard-to-make-you-cry kind of emotion seen in the likes of the recent Wonder but genuine tear duct pulling. This is a film which genuinely cares about its characters so the audience does too.Some people are calling this the best Pixar film ever but I think that's a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. It lacks the innovation of say, Inside Out and the comedy of Up but that's not say it's a great film because it is. Pixar have just churned out such a high calibre of animated features that to say one is better than the other doesn't really count for much. Coco will certainly be beloved for years to come though, I know I'll be watching it with my kids all the time if anyone would have them with me.",9,0,1,10 February 2018
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Resident Evil: Rubbishalypse
","I'd like to start by saying, I didn't like the first Resident Evil, but I saw potential in the sequel, as we'd be out of that bunker and into the real world, so i liked it enough to see the sequel. And although i would say I did enjoy this one more, I'd still say it was bad.'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is bad on so many levels, but I'd like to start on the good points and end on a negative (I'm in one of those moods).The best part is that it keeps you entertained, in the first half I was rolling my eyes a bit, thinking that it was terrible, but the second half did wake me up a little bit, there's plenty of action and some edge-of-your-seat moments, however this can be undermined by how daft the story is.That's the only good part really, that it was entertaining and enjoyable, arguably the most important factor for a film as well, however I did watch 'Martyrs' for the fourth time the other night and is quite a contrast to this. Masterpiece to meh.Now for the bad points :(. There's a lot of them, so get ya cataracts ready! Firstly, the story was a mish mash like in the first one. This whole business of some annoying engilshman finding his daughter was cliché, his accent got on my nerves, as did his daughter's and I'm English myself! There is little to no character development, no one is likable. When someone dies you don't feel anything, in fact you're egging them on to croak! This is where films such as 'Dawn of the Dead' and '28 Days Later' succeed as zombie films. They aren't big budget, high concept films and so they don't just blow the budget on blowing things up for the sake of it. They concentrate on the characters, people who you care about, making them emotionally driven films. 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' doesn't build on characters. That's a negative in my book.The directing and editing was appalling as well! I couldn't believe what I was seeing, whenever anyone shoots a zombie the cameras all over the place flicking back and forth so that you completely miss what was on screen! It really is awful on the editing side.The acting was bad, the girls just seemed to be there in the male gaze and times have moved on! I'm a male myself, but I just think it's plain sexist to make an attractive female waltz around wearing little to leave to the imagination! We should get past Mulvey's male gaze! In the end Alice ends up fighting bad guys with a towel wrapped around her! Why not go the full hog and have her shooting people naked! Well, it wouldn't be withing Barthes striptease theory then would it? I know I sound like an old man when I say this (I'm actually 16 :S) but I didn't like the use of CGI, the bit in the church was terrible! And a lot of the time it just thought it was too cool by trying too hard. Let's have a man jump out of a helicopter shooting zombies with cool music in slow motion. It's trying too hard and it just isn't 'cool'. Don't get me wrong, sometimes it was quite 'cool' but most of the time they tried too hard.In the end 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' plays out more as an action movie rather than a horror film. Leave the zombies to my Romero. There was plenty of shooting, but no blood. I like to see my zombie films gory and scary. Believe or not however, I did actually enjoy some parts. I don't think I'd be the only person who rolled my eyes at some ridiculous B-movie machine gun wielding monster in a leather jacket. Was I?",5,2,5,5 June 2011
Mulholland Drive," entiendes? ¡No!
","A lot of people say that 'Rosebud' is the greatest mystery from Hollywood, but actually I think that Mulholland Drive is. I've never experienced anything quite like it. Its plot is slow-moving and sometimes feels unconnected to anything, yet it's too engrossing to look away. Mulholland Drive is one of the most intriguing films I've ever had the pleasure to watch and it's one that demands viewing multiple times. It's that type of film where you think that everything will be explained to you at the end (like The Skin I Live In) however, being a David Lynch film, this doesn't happen and the film is all the better for it.Once the film had finished I hadn't a clue what I'd just watched, yet I couldn't wait to get onto that wonderful thing called Google and find the answers! The ten clues in the DVD also did not help one bit! It forces you to analyse everything and makes you realise what an astonishingly clever many David Lynch is. Every scene has a purpose, it just requires strong thought which is why a lot of people would instantly disregard this film as meaningless rubbish. However, if you dig deeper you may find yourself in awe at one of the most intricate plots ever established.I loved the whole metaphor for the Hollywood dream being a lie. Words can't describe how clever this film is. Any film that has a whole website dedicated to a whole range of crack-pot explanations is surely a masterpiece, and I truly believe that Mulholland Drive is. It stops becoming a film and turns into art. An extremely interesting and involving art-piece that I found myself being sucked into. The mystery is just captivating, with various scenes that seem like they've just been shoved in like the hit-man scene (which is hilarious) yet you can't stop watching it! It's very difficult to put into words.Reading various explanations only makes me appreciate this film more, and the amount of thought and care that has gone into it. Naomi Watts puts on a brilliant performance and I found myself completely captivated by her story. There are scenes that seem to go on for such a long time, such as the remarkable audition scene, however it's scenes like this which give Mulholland Drive such a dream-like atmosphere and pulls you into the story even deeper. The club Silencio goes on for an awful long time, yet I wasn't bored, just astonished at the film's atmosphere. There's something about it.Of course the film is fabulously directed and I can see myself becoming more of a fan of David Lynch now that I've seen the brilliant Elephant Man and the good but flawed Wild at Heart. He's certainly very unique and this film is unlike any other I've seen before. It's a film that will make you perplexed but also gripped. At a hefty two and a half hours long I was never bored and just wanted to see it all again! Mulholland Drive really is a masterpiece that will get your mind boggling like a boggle champ. It's incredibly haunting with bizarre imagery that is sure to always find a place wedged in your mind. It's one of those films that stays with you, and you don't really want it to leave either.",10,22,31,2 February 2013
Evil Dead," Evil and deadly. A solid remake!
","Now, let's start off by addressing the elephant in the room. Evil Dead is not as good as the original, The Evil Dead. The original is a true classic in my opinion, although I am biased being a big horror fan. The idea of a remake intrigued me because something truly exciting could come out of the same set-up with a bigger budget and Evil Dead is that! I was hugely excited from the moment I saw the intense red band trailer which promised one hell of a horror film! Unfortunately, hopes started to deflate when Luke-warm reviews came out amidst a horde of rave reviews, so I scaled my hopes down and I'm glad I did because it isn't as great as the trailer. It is however one of the most hardcore horror films to come out in mainstream cinema in years, so it's no surprise that it's been a huge box office hit in America!What's great about this film is that it isn't a complete carbon copy of the original. It has new characters, new set-pieces and a whole horde of differences. This is how a remake should be approached in my opinion, as I see no point in doing something shot-for-shot such as the Psycho remake, because it's already been done! Of course Evil Dead does feature some of the iconic scenes such as the infamous tree rape, but it's largely approached refreshingly differently. One thing I loved was that it wasn't about a bunch of dumb kids going to an old cabin to party at the weekend, rather about friends trying to help someone go cold turkey. This also allows for different interpretations, as it isn't clear how much of it is in the main girl's head.Evil Dead thrives on its break-neck pace. The film gets into the action extremely quickly, even more quickly than the original I'd say, which is a huge plus for me. There really is not one dull moment and once the demon chaos starts, it really does not stop. It's a non-stop thrill ride with some really exciting and memorable moments, making it a film to be watched more than once. Like the original, the film feels like an ordeal, with some extremely tense moments. Also, like the original, it isn't afraid to shy away from the gore. It really isn't afraid to shy away at all! It's one of the bloodiest films I've seen in recent years, which makes it great fun and much more intense to watch. There's loads of cringey moments with a finale to die for. In fact, the finale features one of the best kills I've seen in any horror film, almost reaching the heights of THAT kill in Frontier(s).My only real grip with Evil Dead is that the characters weren't particularly likable or that memorable, aside from main girl Mia. One of the great things about the original is that you could like all of the characters, but here it's difficult to feel sorry for them when they die (which sounds like a really awful thing to say). I would've liked to have seen more character building during the action, to really make the film strong, however as it remains it's still a very much above average horror film. The demons were also less memorable and far less frightening than the original, aside from the creepy Exorcist-styled demon of Mia. I also think the film would have benefited from some dark humour, as there were one or two moments of very dark humour which fitted the film well and would've added to its entertainment factor.However, Evil Dead is still a pretty amazing remake, although probably not as good as Mother's Day or Last House on the Left, you can rest assure that it's better than the likes of The Hitcher and such. It's refreshing to see a real horror throw-back with outstanding practical effects, instead of cheap and lazy CGI (I say cheap, it's probably really expensive, but it looks cheap!). The amount of blood and gore is unholy, and makes for a very memorable horror film. I heavily enjoyed it, but non-horror fans will probably find it hard to like. It should certainly knock some sense into inexperienced kids who get freaked out by Paranormal 26 and the likes! I look forward to seeing it again, and it's definitely a film every horror fan should have proudly in their collection!",8,4,17,21 April 2013
The Piano," Put this in the tip, this piano's out of tune
","So 'The Piano' is a masterpiece is it? Well it would be unfair to say that nothing happened at all, but I don't think that it's possible to make draw out a completely passionless affair for two hours and not feel an ounce of boredom. 'The Piano' for me was a bit like the 'Citizen Kane' effect. People say how it's absolutely amazing and full of thoughtful symbols but I must be blind because I can never see them. Apart from the in-your-face haunting imagery at the end.'The Piano' just felt completely dull and bland for the most part. Very little happens in the way of plot, basically an obnoxious mute woman moves to a barren island to be arranged to be married to Henry Bell (Sam Neill) and she brings her beloved piano with her on a little canoe (as if). Whilst their the stubborn Henry Bell refuses to let Holly hunter bring her lovely piano because it's too big and so the man off Sister Act some how comes to take it (weird actor choice). Annoyed she goes over to his little hut and asks for it back. He makes a bargain with her, she has to come over their and play it for every black key whilst he does increasingly more perverted things to her. Anyway they end up having an affair, Henry bell finds out, chops off her finger and she goes off the island.Character development is sparse, and as you can tell, the plot is annoyingly thin to make a full two hours out of. The affair is also completely unconvincing. Why would a seemingly posh lady have it off with a rough native from Sister Act? The affair is also completely passionless. There is literally zero chemistry between them and so it's hard to care about them. It also doesn't help that Ada is such an unlikably angry character, who you can't help but dislike. The man from Sister Act is also entirely unlikable because he's just a complete pervert. Henry bell's the most interesting character, but he's also not likable. And as for the girl! My god she's annoying with her pathetic Scottish accent and wailing cries. I know she's only a little girl but, that doesn't stop her from being annoying.However, 'The Piano' is nicely shot for the most part, and it did show marvellous potential towards the end when Henry Bell goes mad and chops off Holl Hunter's finger. The last shot is also quite creepy and haunting. But, it's a difficult path getting there. It's two hours but it felt more like two and a half! The performances are OK but they're no one you're bound to fall in love with. 'The Piano' was a dull and sometimes painfully boring film. I think that it spends too much time doting around with symbols rather than giving us some substance to back up the symbols (I'm thinking 'Black Swan'). Save yourself the time and watch the French & Saunders version.",2,7,14,12 February 2012
The Dark Knight," One of the greatest films I have ever seen
","If I had to use one word to describe The Dark Knight it would be one of the following: astounding, incredible, unforgettable, mesmerising, awe-inspiring, masterpiece, unmissable, amazing, gripping, inconceivable, captivating, dizzying, enthralling... And the list of superlatives could go on and on, and these words will probably featuring too much in my review. It's amazing to think that I've been missing out on this hype for about four years, having only just watched it last night (or should I say Knight), it took me a while to sink my teeth into Batman Begins because I thought it was going to be just another naff superhero film, but I actually ended up loving it! After I couldn't wait any longer I snapped The Dark Knight up for the incredible price of £6.00 on blu-ray (that's about $10 I think) and prepared myself to watch it. Although, I was scared that it wasn't going to live up to the hype, it did.The Dark Knight makes Batman Begins look like kids stuff. It can proudly sit amongst Christopher Nolan's other 5 star masterpieces (Memento, The Prestige, Inception) and make friends with every single one of them. Because Christopher Nolan hasn't created a superhero film, but a straight-up adult crime thriller. It's much more mature than Batman Begins and I was surprised and Begins' maturity, because a superhero film suggests that a hint of slight comic violence or caper is going to be involved (even Begins had the comic idea of crazy gas being poured into the city's drain pipes) but there isn't a single camp feature in The Dark Knight thanks to it being so cemented in reality its unreal!The Dark Knight is only rated a 12A because of the merchandising that appeals to young children, but I would not let anyone under 12 watch this. Although no blood is seen, the violence is still pretty horrific with an absolutely frightening and truly psychotic villain which children aren't going to take too lightly. The first hour or so is also incredibly intricate and showcases Nolan brothers outstanding writing skills, which kids are not going to understand in the slightest. Even I found it hard to follow and I'm 17 going on 18! So remember parents, just because its got Batman in, doesn't mean its the hyper-camp 60's TV show that you used to watch! This is an adult Batman (and I don't mean that in a weird porn way) it's incredibly dark. The hefty running time of two and a half hours will also make kids restless, however this film suits being an epic and I didn't want it to end!The action is absolutely mesmerising with some truly unforgettable set-pieces that had my jaw on the floor (The lorry chase sequence was one of the highlights for me) these are heart-pounding action sequences that have an incredible intensity about them because they just feel so real and directed with style! Not only does it make the film unbelievably entertaining to watch, but it makes it utterly captivating and involving, just willing you not to take your eyes off the incredible action that's unfolding. But of course, this isn't just about astounding action sequences (although they do thankfully have a major part) there is also an equally involving and very human story underneath that has you cheering for Batman and cowering from the Joker.Which brings me on to that little chestnut. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is just as legendary as everyone says it is. You might dismiss and think 'well they're only saying that because he's dead' but even if he was alive, he wouldn't lose an ounce of respect. He is absolutely terrifying and a captivating character. Most villains have an objective or motive, but the Joker just wants to cause absolute chaos. And he succeeds. He's like a one-man version of 'Project Chaos' from Fight Club, which makes him one of the most compelling and captivating villains of all time. He leaves Batman in the shade, which is fine because he had his time to shine in Batman Begins! The rest of the cast is superb too. Christian Bale again makes a very suitable Batman, Michale Caine and Morgan Freeman are of course as amazing as ever and the character of Rachel is also made much more interesting and deeper, perhaps down to the wonderful Maggie Gyllenhal (is that how you spell it?) who plays her. I also thought that Harvey Dent would be quite a dull character (probably because of his profession) but he actually turned out to be an incredibly emotional character, played with brilliant humanity by Aaron Eckhart (of Conversations With Other Women fame). Dent's transition is brilliant and his make-up is Oscar-winning stuff (you'll see what I mean).I also have to comment on the incredible music throughout. The score is mesmerising and especially the Joker's theme which really increases the tension and intensity. The music lifts the film straight off the ground just to reaffirm its classic status.The Dark Knight is just pure escapism. By the end of it you feel as if you've stepped into Gotham City and had a deliciously dark tour of a place that feels too real to be true. It's incredibly entertaining and the dynamic relationship between Batman and the Joker is absolutely enthralling. It's jam-packed with breath-taking and intense action sequences and Christopher Nolan has definitely matured in directing. His direction is jaw-dropping at times and the Ariel shots of the city literally made me gasp in awe. There is also some wonderful moments of smouldering tension as well as iconic scene after iconic scene. Throw in a beautifully intricate script, amazing performances and an ending to die for and you have one truly amazing film. You know a film is good when an ending gives you chills and this one did, and that doesn't happen too often. I can't wait to see The Dark Knight Rises! (hopefully soon!)",10,0,4,29 July 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," PhenomenHAL
","Last night I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey for the very first time. I don't know what has put me off seeking it out for all these years. Perhaps it's because I'm not a big sci-fi fan, however I am a Stanley Kubrick fan. I particularly adore The Shining and love the way Stanley Kubrick soaks up a hypnotic atmosphere so that the film becomes an experience. After seeing some clips on the strange documentary, Room 237, I thought that the film looked right up my alley! I've also heard nothing but hype for years with people calling it one of the greatest films ever made, so I was extremely excited when I sat down to watch it.Unfortunately watching it, for me, was a little bit like sex. You want the first time to be the best, but in honesty, the more you do it, the better it gets. I had a banging headache throughout the first half and so really could not appreciate the loud music and atonal sounds because it was just so painful! Halfway through, I had to leave and get myself a Tesco headache pill and towards the end of the film it did go away. I also left to go to the loo about three times, as I had a lot of coffee to drink so that I'd have the stamina to stay up and also to sober myself up.Why am I telling you this? Well, I don't know. I think to get the full 2001 effect, you need to completely immerse yourself in it, but I struggled to do this. However, that doesn't mean that I didn't appreciate what I saw. In fact, I'm pretty sure that what I saw was an absolute masterpiece. I was completely sucked in, right from the beginning where sinister music played for about five minutes over a blank screen. It's such an unusual way to open, hinting that the film you're about to see isn't your usual rip-roaring science fiction adventure. We then get that glorious famous music with a beautiful image of a sun rising over the Earth. It's an amazing title sequence which made the hairs on my neck stand on end.I think it's a stroke of genius having the first scene, in a film which is largely set in the future, be set at the beginning of time itself. It must have been so jarring for audiences in 1968, of course everyone knows that the film starts with the monkeys now because it's so widely talked about. Speaking of the year in which it came out, I cannot believe that this film was made in the 60's! I saw it in blu-ray and it looked like a film which had came out last week. It's easy to see why it so disliked when it first came out, because it's just so ahead of its time. Although, some of the monkey suits did look a bit naff!We're then thrown into the year 2001, where (apparently) space travel is an everyday thing and stewardesses wear bright pink clothes complete with a strange bubble hat. To be quite honest with you, the remainder of the film is very difficult to put into words. It's pure art in the form of film. It's a rarity these days, however people like David Lynch and Nicolas Winding Refn are striving to keep it alive. There are long sequences of spaceships flying overhead to classical music and people walking slowly upside down. It all creates a certain feeling and experience which you have to see for yourself.2001: A Space Odyssey doesn't really have much of a plot. Astronauts find a strange giant tablet on the moon, and then some more astronauts go on a mission which I don't entirely understand the purpose of, with a creepy robot called, HAL, which is of course now an iconic character. It's strange because a lot of the film is incredibly slow and, dare I say it, boring. But there's something about it which keeps you interested and locked to the screen. Scenes which would last five minutes in an ordinary Hollywood film, last up to half an hour here and it does create a unique and immersive experience which stays on your subconscious for a while.A lot of the film is very haunting. The choral chants whenever the strange black tablet appeared created a wonderful atmosphere of mystery and impending doom. I also found the scene where HAL sings, very creepy. Of course, the most talked about scene is the Lynchian finale where we're plunged into a psychedelic and hypnotic fantasy world. The final scene makes absolutely no sense, but it most definitely haunts you. I couldn't help but have chills all the way up my spine when the music plays and the baby looks right towards you. It's scary and very powerful.I think subsequent viewings are going to make 2001 a definite favourite of mine. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. After seeing this now, I find it strange how people are comparing it to Interstellar. Interstellar is a somewhat conventional and fast-paced sci-fi adventure, albeit an absolutely astounding one! Whereas, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a slow art film. They're impossible to compare! Both of them are masterpieces in their own right though. It's a film which will definitely stay with me, and I look forward to plunging myself into its world again.",10,2,6,14 December 2014
Avatar," Avar-rated
","I've got to admit that a film like 'Avatar' is not the usual film I would go for. I'm not a big sci-fi nut and would only really watch a science fiction film if it was meant to be incredibly good. Don't get me wrong, I like 'District 9' as much as the next person, but I would never watch a film like 'District 9' if someone hadn't told me that it was incredible. A film about giant blue people riding around on deformed dinosaurs doesn't appeal to me. However, when my blonde friend mentioned that he had the DVD how could I not borrow it? This is the most expensive film ever made and the highest grossing. Also, there's someone constantly drooling over it, telling me how amazing it is. Well I had to put it to the test and my thoughts are that it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. But it wasn't as good as everyone was saying.If Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' had passionate intimate relations with Tim Burton's 'Alice In Wonderland' then I would imagine that the offspring would look something like 'Avatar'. And there is certainly no denying at how incredible it looks! The film is a visual feast and would be the perfect film to own on Blu-ray because I don't think that DVD did enough justice to the incredible locations. There's such a great juxtaposition between the dull sciency place and the garish land of the giant blue people. The CGI animation is also almost flawless, although I would say no better than 'King Kong' in some areas. The blue people for example didn't look that great compared to the incredible Kong and his dinosaur friends.I think that the visuals were so sensational that people sort of became hypnotised and desensitised into thinking that 'Avatar' is one of the most amazing films of all time. I watched it for the first time on DVD, which means that the screenplay also shows up as much as the special effects, and they certainly differ in quality. When we first enter the land of the blue people it plays out almost like a video game, with a big blue man patrolling the forest with a big gun and shooting weird enemies. The screenplay is incredibly dumb in other words. It's nothing we haven't seen before but because it's put into this garish fantasy world it appears almost brand new.It's also really patronising with the 'save the planet' theme being constantly jammed down our throats. The big blue people even use their hair to connect with the wildlife and be at one with them. They're no different from my hippy tree-hugging Aunty Susie. The love story is also really clichéd and sometimes feels forced. Some of the characters are two-dimensional and predictable as well with the evil Army man with his army of evil humans going to destroy the blue people's beautiful habitat to get the oil (I know it's not oil, but really it's no different to it). However, some characters are also quite likable like Sigourney Weaver's character who was really funny on occasions! The final half hour was actually really spectacular with incredible action gracing the screen. It suddenly became really fun, although predictable. It was so obvious from the fight that the paraplegic was going to have a massive battle with the evil army man. That part became predictable, but fun. This is what the end to Tim Burton's 'Alice In Wonderland' should've been like! The directing was really impressive throughout as well, as it was full of energy and captured some truly fantastic cinematography. The use of sound was also very effective.But in the end 'Avatar' may look sensational and it does have a heart but it doesn't have a brain. 'Inception' manages to balance incredible visuals with an incredible screenplay and succeeds. Maybe, if 'Avatar' was able to do the same it would've been absolutely brilliant. But it didn't. Films like 'The Artist' completely counter films like 'Avatar' as it doesn't even bother to add any colour or sound, yet wins all the major awards and rightly so! 'Avatar' is a loud, in-your-face and dumb sci-fi actioner that is brilliant to look at and it does get progressively more fun as it goes on, but lacks the writing skills. 'District 9' deals with similar themes but in a much, much more effective way. Watch that instead.",5,1,3,13 March 2012
The Artist," Will leave you speechless
","I'm quite confident to say that 'The Artist' will be the best film of 2012 and the year hasn't really even started yet. It's quite a shame to see how 'The Artist' was only playing on my local cinema (well not local, local that one doesn't have anything worth seeing on it! It's just got one screen and it's usually kiddie films, but it's cheap and they have the odd thing on which can be useful) for just one week, on one of its smaller screens (still bigger than my local, local one!) I can only presume that its been taken off early for 'The Darkest Hour 3D' because they thought that a silent black and white film will not do well. Who's going to want to see a black and white film? Never mind it being silent! Obviously a lot more people are going to want to see the upcoming masterpiece 'The Darkest Hour 3D' that's clogging up two screens because it's in 3D. Well they're wrong! (If I'm assuming correctly) because 'The Artist' sticks one gracious middle finger up at 3D blockbusters and has you asking, 'Who the heck needs sound?'! Because it is an absolute masterpiece!The only other film I've ever felt slightly the same about was last year's 'Black Swan' (although I don't think I'd put it up there yet...) But that just shows how 'The Artist' really is for everyone, because it is absolutely nothing like 'Black Swan' apart from the fact that it ended on the stage. 'Black Swan' is an extremely intense character piece that literally blew my mind (don't worry I'm not schizophrenic) whereas 'The Artist' is a character piece but presented in such a different way that it blew my mind as well! I knew that when I went to see it that it was going to be good, I just didn't have no idea it would be THAT good! I probably would've gone to see the very next screening but it cost £8.65 or something outrageous like that. Thankfully, 'The Artist' is worth every single penny. If you have to pawn your watch to see this film then DO IT!Why am I getting excited about this film? Well, I've never seen anything like it, quite literally because I've never seen a silent film, just parts of 'Nosferatu' and so I wasn't quite sure what to get. Actually 'The Artist' has pretty much everything, fabulous acting, beautiful directing and cinematography, engaging story, amazing music that just carries the whole film! The soundtrack is gorgeous and basically does play throughout the whole film, only when their is no music, it's done in perfect timing and is just breathtaking!'The Artist' also carries so much emotion, it's happy, it's sad, it's angry, it's funny, pretty much every emotion is shed on that screen and it's just an absolute delight to see. I wasn't expecting 'The Artist' to be quite so deep either, because I didn't really know much about it, I just knew it was a love story, when actually it is so much more! It's a character piece really on our hero George who places too much faith in silent films, when talkies suddenly appear around the corner. It's also an extremely clever idea to present a film about the silent era as a silent film, because you can actually sympathise with George as it makes you thing 'Talkies are crap!' When a film can look this beautiful and be silent and black and white.'The Artist' is also so amazingly clever! It's like great literature being projected onto a screen. Like 'Black Swan' and 'A Streetcar Named Desire' it carries so much symbolism and visual metaphors that are just so clever it had me astounded. The film is also so beautifully shot! There are some shots that I thought looked absolutely perfect, like when George sees his shadow on the white screen, and when he sees his reflection wearing a suit, these are absolutely perfect shots that are also executed magnificently. There just seem to be so many great moments throughout the film that are sure to make this film a classic for years to come, it's the definition of 'modern masterpiece'.I have to talk about the actors as well, Jean Dujardin is perfectly cast, from the moment we see him he is instantly likable. He has this perfect silent era charm about him and is such a great comic actor and emotionally charged actor. You can feel his pain and happiness where ever is appropriate. Bérénice Bejo also has a great charm about her, she's weirdly beautiful and also a great actress. The dog is also an absolute joy to watch. When he's on screen (I know it's a 'he'!) he brings guaranteed laughs, and also tugs on your 'aww' strings. The dog is actually an amazing actor and probably should win 'Best Supporting Actor' at the Oscars.In fact 'The Artist' should win everything at the Oscars, it should win 'Best Picture', 'Best Director', 'Best Actor', 'Best Actress', 'Best Screenplay', 'Best Music', 'Best Sound' (no really their is some great use of sound in their!) But then again I said the same thing about 'Black Swan' and that only won the one. 'The Artist' is a film for everyone, it's oozing to the brim with sophistication, and if it was a woman it would charm me right into bed! It'll make you laugh and it just maybe might make you cry on a couple of occasions, but one things for sure it will make you full of absolute joy. 'The Artist' is perfect, basically perfect, from start to finish.",10,12,22,14 January 2012
Mama," Big Mama's house
","Mama's getting an unfair reception! I went in with somewhat low expectations giving all the heavily negative reviews from people. Mama wasn't a must-see film for me, it just happened that a red-headed warrior was interested in it. However, I was pleasantly surprised with what I got! Mama immediately grabbed me from its intriguing opening which was also beautifully shot and felt very Spanish so I knew that I was in good hands, directing-wise. The imagery was atmospheric and almost fairytale-like which was apparent from the opening letters, 'Once Upon A Time' but don't get too excited because it's not as fairytale related as Pan's Labryinth or Livid. I was also surprised at the amount of suspense in this opening sequence too so once it was over with an effective jump scare, I was at ease.Mama plays out like a haunted house movie but it has a much deeper story than that. We're introduced to some likable characters and some surprisingly un-annoying child actors! The girls were actually really good and not as wooden as you'd think they'd be. Every scene is filled with tension and I found myself feeling quite scared in some moments, which is unusual for me and was also something I wasn't expecting. The director (don't know his name, some confusing foreign name I gather) certainly knows how to work his audience and I look forward to what he can conjure up next.Now, if jump scares annoy you for any reason then you might want to give Mama a miss because a lot of the scares rely on jump scares. Nevertheless, these jump scares are extremely well done and the build-up to them is done with nail-biting tension! Mama may only be offering cheap thrills, but they're done in a genuinely scary way and the film does also feature a string of effective and creepy moments which adds to the atmosphere. Mama is never boring either and never forgets its entertainment value or characters. I also found the look of Mama to be quite creepy which is contrary to what a lot of people believe. Sometimes the CGI did look a bit shoddy and some of the floaty effects were over-done, but her face was actually genuinely creepy.The sound effects were also top-notch and are really but to great use in the cinema. There's a moment where a character goes into the dark cabin and you know Mama's there, but you can't see her, all you can hear are these horrible groans and Grudge-like croaky noises and it's actually very creepy! Granted, Mama uses some clichés such as the old Rear Window flashing camera effect but that also conjures up one of the best jump scares in the film and really does fill the scene with tension. So although clichés are used, they're used effectively and do offer some great entertainment.Mama can be original too though. There's a really great flash-back sequence which I've never seen the likes off before. It's like an expressionist painting all in the point of view of Mama and it creates a great impact and allows you to gain verstehen for Mama's mysterious character. My only real complaint about the film is that it does lose its way with the ending. Mama stops being creepy because she starts to function too much like a human and we see far too much of her. Everything feels a bit silly and rushed and also gave me vibes of the ending for Hocus Pocus for some reason, which is not good. Don't get me wrong I love Hocus Pocus, but it's a Disney film and I should not be feeling vibes of a Disney film in a serious horror film.Ending aside, Mama is a great night out. It's not as amazing as Insidious or Sinsiter, but it has an original and interesting idea behind it and is played out in a superiorly creepy way to most ghosty films. Mama always kept me entertained and the tension-filled directing is sure to keep you on edge. The film is full of great atmosphere and imagery which stops it from being another forgettable haunted house movie. I think people are giving Mama an unfair time. I really enjoyed it and so did the people I saw it with. I anticipate what this director has up his sleeves next time!",7,1,2,28 February 2013
Sinister," It takes a lot to scare me... This did!
","Ever since the very first trailer came out I thought, 'now this looks good!' However, some quite poor reviews came in so my dreams were shattered slightly. But then suddenly some rave reviews came out, even from my favourite critic, Chris Tookey who gave it 5 stars! My faith was suddenly re-installed and I was incredibly excited to see it. It didn't disappoint!With 'The Cabin in the Woods' and now 'Sinister', 2012 is restoring my faith in modern horror. It's a truly outstanding film that had me gripped for its entire 115 minutes. The film doesn't dawdle about too much either, it opens with a highly unsettling clip of found footage and then we get a beautiful swooping shot of a man and his family moving in to a new house. It's a standard set-up that we've even seen a few months ago in the surprisingly fun horror, 'The Possession' but it's a clever one because we're mostly focused on our hero and in a sense that is what the film is about. His obsession with himself and trying to be re-ignite his fame after writing a highly successful debut true crime novel, followed by several duds.I was quite surprised as to how much exposition was given to the main character and it only makes the film even more compelling than it is. He's also played brilliantly by Ethan Hawke, who makes up for the lack of acting skills his wife possesses. It reminded me a little of 'The Shining' with the egotistical novelist stumbling upon a certain ghostly history, and it certainly contains the same amount of creepy moments. Ethan stumbles upon the super 8 films quite quickly which I was surprised and pleased about, as all too often there's a belated exposition before anything remotely frightening happens.These super 8 films are masterpieces in themselves. It's a sort of car crash effect, as you don't really want to see them, but you can't stop watching. They're all incredibly creepy, unsettling and sinister (like what I did there?) They are also set-up perfectly with the horrible grainy picture, silence as well as highly unsettling music that all adds to the creepiness. All of them are engaging and compelling to watch. They're also very chilling and are sure to engrave themselves into your mind for a long time after the film has finished.From then on it's an intriguing and creepy mystery as more and more disturbing information is uncovered. It's also clever how it's unclear if some of what Ethan's seeing is actually real or not. Is he really hearing noises or is it just the whisky talking? I liked the whole family element as well, showing the protagonist as not just some perfect hero, but also as a flawed character. The whole strained relationship with his wife is a fantastic element on top of the central ghost story. Although the woman who plays her is incredibly wooden!There's a strong, unsettling atmosphere that underlies through the whole film. The demon man is also quite frightening and not too much is explained about him which certainly adds to scare factor. I've heard people call this a boring film and a bad film, but it's none of these things. It's a genuinely horrifying horror film with fantastic writing and directing. It's the type of film that gets under your skin and leaves its print in your mind for a long time after the credits have rolled. The ending is one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen in a horror film and I've seen many!'Sinister' is a ghost story of Japanese proportions. By the end, I was actually terrified and had chills all down my back, which is something that doesn't happen too often. I never get scared watching films, but after this and seeing 'Noroi: The Curse' which also frightened me, I was starting to think that I was becoming soft! But then I thought no. These are just brilliantly scary films that are high on atmosphere and don't solely rely on jump scares like too many American ghost films. 'Sinister' is one of the best horror films this year. It has a relentless sense of dread throughout and is also incredibly effective and compelling. I can't wait to see it again, and also can't urge you enough to go and see it for yourself! Although, I'd recommend a night light for when you sleep.Please read my weird and wonderful horror movie review blog! www.asdaman.wordpress.com",9,171,254,14 October 2012
Up," Soars past every Pixar film to date!
","You might think that from my summary that I hate Pixar films. The opposite is actually true, I love Pixar films, they're wildly original and inventive with brilliant, unforgettable characters and a narrative with heart. I've not seen a bad Pixar film yet (although I haven't seen Cars). I've been wanting to see Up for a very long time and finally my little (well actually, incredibly tall) blonde friend decided to buy it for me this Christmas in Blu-ray no less (he spares no expense!) and what do I find, after I had expectations as high as Carl's floating house? I find probably the best Pixar film ever! It's probably even the best animated film I've ever seen too. Up ticks every single box and more. It has a genius original plot, sensational characters, a huge heart, is absolutely hilarious and is also incredibly entertaining whilst balancing all of these things.Up starts with one of the most touching flashback and montage sequences've ever seen. I can't think of a film that gets you teary in the first 5 minutes, but Up manages it. Whilst it didn't squeeze out a very small man tear, it did undeniably move me and also completely engage me into this old man's super sweet life. The character of Carl is so beautifully realised, as he clings onto the past and never having the chance to have a child, his only lasting aspiration is to go to Paradise Falls, where he promised to take his wife (Ellie) all those years ago. The trouble is that Ellie has now sort of become the house and so that obviously has to tag along too.The image of the house floating off into the sky has already and rightly become iconic. It's a bizarre, yet weirdly awe-some sight and could be symbolism for getting away from a crazy world (like the escapism you get from watching Up!). Now, Carl isn't entirely flawless, he has a temper and there's this rather deep scene where Carl has to go to court after causing someone a head injury! He was also not very nice to a cute and hilarious boy, who happens to be a stowaway on Carl's house. However, of course by the end of this epic journey Carl begins to realise the greatest adventure of all is having a child, or a surrogate grand-child in this case. It's enough to produce tears and chills, seeing such an odd couple become so close.The look of the film is nothing short of breath-taking. I saw Up in blu-ray and it's probably the best blu-ray I've ever seen and is right up there with The Dark Knight! It looks crisper than a Walker's factory and helps to show off the film's incredibly vibrant colours and imagination. The animation has such depth and detail, and the scope is so huge you can't help but feel transported to another world. And whilst the film can be wonderfully surreal (talking dogs flying aeroplanes anyone?) it never loses sight of its plot and characters. Now the characters are nothing short of genius. Dug the dog is an absolute hoot, and Kevin the bird is just as hilarious. Dug actually speaks like how you'd imagine a dog to speak, it's brilliant! The relationships between the colourful characters are also nothing short of touching and engaging. The theme of protecting nature is much more involving and less patronising than Avatar's attempt at conveying the message. The screenplay is full of wit and endless imagination which helps Up to become an instant classic. I was riveted by the grand chase scenes and profoundly moved by the slower, more character-driven scenes.Up is the full package. It's a highly engaging and hilarious animation with a fantastic sense of adventure. The wonderful directing and screenplay will have you hooked on one of the greatest animated adventures ever filmed. It's perfect for children but also offers so much more for adults, as it boldly explores some heart-wrenching ideas and touching relationships. By the end of it I felt as uplifted as Carl's house! It's a tale for our times, a wonderful feat of the imagination and a refreshingly original tale. Pixar's out done itself again, but Up will be preposterously difficult to beat. Do yourself a favour and watch Up on blu-ray!",10,1,3,4 January 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Real horror show!
","'A Clockwork Orange' is hands down, one of the best films I have ever seen. It blew me the away the first time I saw it and then it just started to grow on me, it probably hypnotises you somewhere amongst the sublime, surreal, psychedelic and quite frankly genius film-making. Each time you watch it you gain something new and you find yourself appreciating more of it. This really is what all good films should be about.The first 40 minutes defines the reason for its banning. It's ultraviolent even for today's standards and also quite unsettling the way such awful acts are being committed with a surreal flair and with such weird humour! The most controversial and famed part obviously being the iconic 'Singin' in the Rain' whilst raping a woman. You don't know whether to laugh or gasp in shock. In the end you find yourself doing a bit of both! The directing is so alive and full of unusual techniques and it comes together so beautifully and almost perfect.Kubrick is obviously known for his exceptional films such as 'The Shining' which is another horror masterpiece I adore. Here I think he gives his best example of directing. The cinematography IS perfect! And there is no doubt about it, right down to the lighting it is just utterly beautiful to look at. The shadows of the four youths in front of the infamous tramp beating is possibly the best example of the genius cinematography. Even the fight scenes seem to be like a ballet and an art-form.I know that some people will simply not quite 'get' the weirdness but that's because this sort of thing is new and different. This is an original approach to film-making and makes it what it is. The screenplay is nothing short of genius, even though you can hardly understand it with the futuristic speak like, 'yarbles' and 'viddy' yet you know what they're saying! The plot is brilliant, we're liking this truly awful character but because of the great writing and Malcolm Mcdowell's exceptional performance. We get to sort of admire Alex. Malcolm carries such presence and charm to the film, which also makes it what it is! Their is a great contrast between the psychedelic life of committing ultraviolent acts and the stillness of prison-life.In the end we are given a near-perfect film. It shows a genius direction and writing along with characters who we can care about. This is nothing short of a masterpiece and one of the best films you will see EVER! You might not get it but give it a chance ducks!",10,0,2,3 July 2011
The Fly," Absolutely buzzin'
","David Cronenberg is well-known for his incredibly repulsive films, and this one has to his most revolting film he's ever done! You really need to see 'The Fly' to truly believe it. If you don't cringe at least once then something is really wrong with you. I don't want to sound negative about this film because a man turning into a human fly isn't going to be a pretty experience to behold so I really admire it's sheer power to disgust, and for a film that could've gone the wrong way so easily, this is really a masterpiece.'The Fly' could've ended up really cheesy. Jeff Goldblum could've gotten into his telepod with a fly in it and come out immediately sprouting wings or having big bug-eyes (like the original) but instead the genius lies in the way the film slowly burns as we watch a brilliant man turn into something so unrecognisable. 'The Fly' could've also fallen short if it copied the original which so many remakes tend to do when there's no point! Nope, 'The Fly' perfects the original by about 10 miles, by taking a whole new direction.What really makes 'The Fly' is its hideous make-up and special effects they are truly gut-wrenchingly A-mazing! To be honest I think it would be a crime if it didn't get an Oscar for them because even now they look amazing. I can see that if 'The Fly' was remade again today (I wouldn't be surprised) hideous (not in a good way) CGI effects would pollute the screen and take over from the incredible story. I know I sound like some grumpy middle-aged man when I talk about the effects of today but I'm not one yet.David Cronenberg's directing is also really good! He makes everything seem so positive at first and it's the way David handles the gradual changes in his personality and appearance and the way it effects the people around him. This also goes for the screenplay which is also written by David, as it's equally fantastic and handled with precise care. The finale has to be one of the most mind-blowing I've ever seen, it is just completely over-loaded with suspense and terrifying special effects. It also makes you feel sorry for the fly in the end; even though it's hard to tell if he's a villain or still the hero now.'The Fly' is a must see. Not just for horror fans (although it helps) but for everybody. It's handled with perfection and style with strong performances by Jeff and the other woman who was in 'BeetleJuice' was OK as well. 'The Fly' has everything: Great characters, a great plot, more than great special effects and brantastic direction. It'll have you buzzin'!",9,0,1,10 September 2011
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," The sickest film ever?
","In 1973 most audiences were fainting and having heart attacks over shockers such as, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Exorcist. Little did they know that two years later a little Italian film would pop out of the waters and stun the world to silence. Being the twisted chap that I am, I had of course heard a lot about Salo. If you look at anyone's list of disturbing films, then you're likely to see Salo right at the top. A film so shocking that upon its release, director Pier Paolo Pasolini was murdered in very mysterious circumstances. Having read a lot about it, I put off seeing Salo. Who wants to see about the rape and torture of teenagers? Well, I suppose that curiosity got the better of me.Salo isn't just about the mental and physical torture of young innocents, it just appears that way. The film is quite obviously one big political statement as four bored old fascists decide to use a bunch of young men and women for their own needs. These needs consist of the most depraved sexual acts you could think of. Salo's full to the brim with rape and sexual humiliation. By the end of it, rape feels like a natural occurrence, although it's still no easier to watch.Some call it a masterpiece because of its political message; however I fail to see why. Whilst the film is very well made, with excellent directing and acting, there's no plot. I see the narrative of a film as being quite an important aspect. Salo is quite literally two hours of despicable depravity. There's nothing more to it than watching four old perverts perv over teenagers and finally kill them in the most horrific ways possible.Contrary to popular belief, Salo is not gory. There are two moments of extreme gore at the end, but other than that the violence remains purely sexual. What makes the film so difficult to watch is that it's all real! It's like watching some sort of soft child porn film. The actors are clearly under eighteen, yet are completely naked in nearly all scenes and fondled by old men and women. It's extremely uncomfortable to watch. The constant explicit tales, which the old women tell, of paedophilia are also very disturbing to hear. Especially, as it's used as an opportunity to molest the children.The film reaches its most disturbing peak during the chapter aptly named, 'Circle of s**t'. Parts in this chapter actually almost made me gag and is the hardest chapter to watch for me. Watching people being force fed poo is not my idea of entertainment. The fact that all the old fascists contently eat the poo makes the scene all the more disturbing. It has to be the most disturbing scene I've ever watched. I've seen poo being eaten before (not in real life, but in the Thai thriller, 13: Game of Death) but not in this much grotesque detail.Who would've thought that the most disturbing film ever made would come out in 1975? If this film was made now, then there's no way that it would ever see the light of day, and I'm surprised it has been widely distributed now. Perhaps, Lars von Trier should do a remake? Or maybe we shouldn't give him ideas! Salo is by far the most disturbing film I've ever seen and I have zero intention in seeing it again. I'm bemused by the amount of critical praise this film receives. Even with the political message and excellent directing, you're still left with an overlong and perverted mess of a film with extremely little plot.Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com",3,1,4,25 October 2014
Don't Breathe," You won't be able to
","Being a horror fanatic, I'd been in the know about Don't Breathe for months before the trailer had even come out. It had premiered at some weird festival and started generating a lot of hype. 'The best horror movie in decades!' You know that sort of thing which people seem to say about every good horror movie coming out. So I'd been excited about it and I was also a fan of Fede Alvarez's fun Evil Dead remake. I avoided any trailers and tried to put aside the general hype after being disappointed with Green Room earlier in the year and just went in with the mindset that this was going to be an above average horror film. I needn't have worried because Don't Breathe totally lives up to the hype.Don't Breathe is exactly the kind of horror film I love. Intense, thrilling and relentless. It's set mainly in one location and follows three young tea leafs robbing an elderly blind man. Fede does a great job of crucially making us care for these criminals, or at least one of them. Jane Levy is the girl you'll be rooting for here and we're given a lovely bit of context which outlines her desperate situation so that our sympathies lie with her. It takes just enough time to build the characters and the plot so that we care about the rest of the film.Once the kids step into the little old house the film really begins and I was left holding my breath until the very end. At first I was a little concerned as I couldn't see how the filmmakers could spread robbing a blind OAP into a 90 minute film. I mean, he's blind, how hard can it blummin' be? It turns out very. This isn't just any old blind man, this is an ex soldier with ears like a bat who's still equipped with the skills to beat any grown man to a pulp. He's a character who you'll go away remembering thanks to Stephen Lang's dominant presence as well as the character's dark backstory which is best left unrevealed.Don't Breathe spends most of its running time squeezing every last bit of suspense it can. It reminded me a bit of the French horror, Inside, although of course far less extreme. Just in the sense that it's an absolute roller coaster despite being confined to one location and a few characters. It's a really intense film and at times I was left covering my mouth just in case I made a noise which the blind man could hear. All of the tension comes from Fede Alvarez's superb directing skills though. We're given long and still takes instead of quick shaky edits so you can see what's happening on screen. The use of silence is particularly key in creating tension though and the effect is used to its absolute best here.Whilst the film isn't the most original, it still feels fresh and unpredictable thanks to the superb high level of quality across all departments. The directing is masterful, the writing is taut, the music is effective, the acting is good for the most part, although the young Tom Cruise lookalike was a little wooden at times. The film also offers some deliciously dark ideas which I've never seen explored before in a horror film. So whilst we've seen this kind of scenario before (Livid has exactly the same premise) Don't Breathe still proves itself to be one of the very best of its kind.To say any more about Don't Breathe would be to spoil the nail-biting twists and turns in store. All you need to know is that it's a relentlessly intense experience which never gives you a chance to breathe. It looks like Fede will have a long and promising career in horror, as with only two films under his belt, he has proved that he has the skills to create some of the best horror films that Hollywood has to offer. And let's just take a moment to appreciate all the fantastic horror films 2016 has had to offer. In any other year, Don't Breathe would've been my number one but with films like: The Conjuring 2, 10 Cloverfield Lane, The Witch (my personal favourite of the year so far) and the upcoming Blair Witch, we've been treated to a surge of seriously high quality horror. Don't Breathe can still sit proudly among them though. It's a taut, adrenaline-fuelled ride which I can't imagine anyone not enjoying.",9,4,9,5 September 2016
Eyes Wide Shut," Will leave your eyes were firmly wide open!
","Over ten years later Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is released to the world. I was only four years old at the time, but I could imagine the hype. The final film of arguably the greatest film director to have ever lived. The final cut of Eyes Wide Shut was delivered to Warner Brothers four days prior to Stanley's mysterious death. Stanley called the film his 'greatest contribution to the art of cinema' but it was greeted with hostility and it's easy to see why. Eyes Wide Shut is arguably his most impenetrable film. The average cinemagoer can appreciate the horror of The Shining and the comedy of Dr. Strangelove without digging deeper into them. However, Eyes Wide Shut is very difficult to enjoy without unlocking those hidden meanings and symbols.It's possibly his most enigmatic and mysterious film, arguably even more so than 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining. The eye-popping finale to 2001 has more or less been unlocked, but the secrets that lie within Eyes Wide Shut still remain closed and debated upon just like The Shining still is today. However, whilst The Shining is universally lauded as a masterpiece, Eyes Wide Shut is still yet to receive the recognition it deserves. I remember when I first saw the film one night, on my own and finding it incredibly slow but intriguing. I also remember finding a lot of it very frightening.Last night I gave it a re-watch with my sister and mother by my side. My sister switched off about twenty minutes in and started playing on her phone, whilst my mother said once it finished 'Well, I'm not surprised he died after making that shite!' which of course makes no sense, but you don't know my Mum. I definitely found a new appreciation for it though. There's so much going on in the film that it's impossible to take it all in on your first viewing. You'll probably end up disliking it, but give it a few days and you'll find yourself pondering over it. You may even find yourself becoming haunted by it like Dr. Bill's guilty conscience.At its core, Eyes Wide Shut is a Lynchian mystery set in a dreamy New York City. Most know all the bizarre plot twists and turns now, but the less you know the better. Like most Stanley films, Eyes Wide Shut is more of an experience that can't be put into words. It's not the type of film you can dip in and out of, you have to watch it all the way through and give it your full attention. Watching Tom cruise walking down the street shouldn't be interesting, but something about it keeps you inexplicably transfixed to the screen. Similarly, the seemingly never ending monologues carry a hypnotic grip on your senses, such as Nicole's dreamy drug-fuelled confession which kick starts the entire story.The film holds the record for the longest continual film shoot at four hundred days so the directing is of course beyond masterful. Every single shot is carefully considered and the trademark tracking shots are as dizzying as ever. The mise-en-scene in each scene is also extremely important to consider. There are so many things hidden in the background, such as the recurring multi-coloured Christmas trees which disappear once Tom Cruise enters the mysterious cult. Could this relate to the 'end of the rainbow' as stated earlier in the film? It's little details like this which make Eyes Wide Shut endlessly fascinating to analyse. Only until you analyse the film can you appreciate the painstaking details and intelligent intricacies.Stanley's final film is often claimed to be a limp ending to a phenomenal filmography, however I'd strongly disagree. Any true Stanley lover will recognise the obscure genius of Eyes Wide Shut. Conspiracy theorists will thrive off the illuminati and Satanist symbolism, but I think there's more to it than that. It's a wonderfully mysterious film with a brooding dreamlike atmosphere. I also have to mention the brilliantly creepy (yet incredibly simple) piano score which has to be the scariest use of a few notes since the Jaws theme tune. Whilst the film isn't quite up to the impossibly high standards of 2001, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, it isn't miles off. Maybe after some repeated views I might hold it in even higher regards.",9,1,2,19 July 2011
Les Misérables," One of the greatest films I've ever seen
","I think it's important that I start off by saying that I've never seen the stage version of Les Miserables, nor have I read the original book. In fact, going in I had no real clue what the film was about at all! Also with all the hype surrounding it, I was preparing myself for something unbelievably good and that's exactly what I got. 2013's only just begun yet Les Miserables is already looking like it's going to be the film of the year (as it came out in January in the UK). It's a spectacular achievement with every department exceeding themselves, whether it be acting, directing or music.I knew that Les Miserables was going to be pretty incredible right from the opening shot with the camera creeping out of the water (and I don't think it's any coincidence that the final shot was soaring in the sky) and sweeping over a huge ship which hundreds of convicts are pulling at with thick ropes. It's a truly epic shot which immediately sets the tone and scope of the film. The image of Russell Crowe pacing up and down over them is also not just phenomenal directing but spectacular cinematography which doesn't hold up until the credits arrive. It immediately transports you to the location and I found myself being sucked in until the very last frame.There was a moment when I realised that what I was watching was quite extraordinary mid-way through one of Hugh Jackman's first songs in a church, as I realised that this song was being sung in almost one shot and it was conveying so much power! The scene is only heightened by the extraordinary sweeping extreme long shot which plunges into the depths of Paris at its most depraved. Anne Hathaway's rendition of I Dreamed A Dream is also one of the most astonishing moments in the film as it's sung in one shot and almost entirely a close-up! It gives the song and the character so much power and you can't help but feel moved by it.Anne Hathaway's role is barely 15 minutes long but in the style of Anthony Hopkins and Judi Dench she could very well win the Oscar despite the little screen time. The role she plays is already significant, but Anne gives it even more significance as we see a woman at the lowest point in her life with zero hope and nothing to live for but her child (the poster girl). Similarly Helena and Sacha have few minutes on screen but offer us so much more. They provide some much needed light relief after some of the most depressing moments captured on film. Sacha is a great actor and is naturally funny so it's great to see him in an actual funny role rather than one of his crude obnoxious characters which serve more to shock than to amuse.Hugh Jackman should also have a high chance for the Oscar (although I do think it will go to Daniel) for he breathes such likable life into his character. Now Hugh and Russell may not be able to sing very well but let's not forget that they're not just singing, they're acting as well and they're fantastic in their roles (besides their not Pierce Brosnan bad!) I hate to admit it but Hugh and Anne did make me go a little teary at the end, however they failed to push out even a very small man tear, as it seems bizarrely, only the Nutty Professor has the power to make me cry! The narrative motors along in a breeze. Some people moan about pacing issues but I found it to be one of the fastest two and a half hours I've experienced, in fact I didn't really want the film to end, and extra character development on certain characters would've been appreciated. Yes some scenes maybe did drag longer than they needed to, but in a film of such length that's to be expected and by no means does it effect the overall film. The narrative features such likable and deep characters that you can't help but find yourself become completely involved in the story and their lives.The production design is also astounding. The costumes and sets are all above par and really help to transport you there, making it more of an experience than a film. Tom Hooper's directing is also nothing short of incredible. At times it felt as if Darren Aronofsky was behind the camera! I know he already won an Oscar for the King's Speech, but here his directing is even better. The raw hand held close-ups on certain characters convey a certain power that's difficult to put into words. He directs on such an epic scale and knows exactly when and where to place the camera. His gorgeous directing alone is worth the price of a ticket! Les Mis also made me produce quite a few chills throughout, which is certainly a sign of a masterpiece and that's exactly what it is. The film conveys such power and in the end becomes incredibly uplifting and the only way to get that feeling is to watch it again. I can see myself watching Les Miserables as many times as Matthew Crawley's mother sits in the front of a car (i.e. A lot!) I'll be counting down the days until its out, until I can see this extraordinary master work again. Even if the idea of people singing constantly puts you off, go and see it, trust me it didn't bother me at all and by the end of it you start to think it's weird when they speak! Films with this power don't come along very often, so you'd be a fool to miss out!",10,1,3,17 January 2013
The Happening," The wind should blow this out the shop window!
","M.Night.Shynamalmamama has made one good film, 'The Sixth Sense' and because of that success he now thinks he's God! He thinks that everything he makes is absolutely brilliant. He's notorious for his twist endings and so i kept on watching 'The Happening' just to see what the ending would be. To see that I wasn't wasting my time, and wait for it to explain everything to me. There wasn't one.So many things are wrong with 'The Happening' and to be honest I was actually quite intrigued in the first 20 minutes or so, it was a nice introduction and it seemed as if it had some nice potential, but then I started to notice that not a lot was HAPPENING! (Pun is absolutely intended) It seemed to reflect a sort of zombie apocalypse film, without the zombies. Or the excitement. Or the suspense. Or the gore. Or the interesting characters. Or the... Yes I could go on and on and on. Truth is it was dull.Another big problem is that it didn't know what it wanted to be! Was it trying to be a horror? Was it trying to be a drama? Was it trying to be a thriller? Instead of picking one of those genres and sticking to it, it decided to combine all three (and probably some others) making a loose story with a very dry execution. The story to me sounded like an eerie horror film, yet nothing much about it was horrific enough. M.Night.Shymanamamalam had some great opportunities to actually get some fantastic deaths (let's face it, that's all it had going for it) but instead all the gory deaths were off-screen, not giving us any chance of us seeing anything! ANNOYING! M.Night.Shylmanaman also thinks that he's some sort of Quentin Tarantino in the script department. He tries to mimic (unsuccessfully I might add) the great suspenseful dialogue which Quientin trademarks in his films, yet Mr.Shylanmanamama messes it all up by talking complete b***ocks all the time about plants talking to us and being in a large group effects the plants and all this nonsense. It's stupid an unnecessary. He also tried to be clever by blatantly making the characters say 'happening' every minute, yeah, ha ha, here my genuine laughter.Then there's the characters. Not one of them is likable and when 'The Happening' rushes to its heart-felt tender finale (it's not by the way) instead of being on the edge-of-your-seat for them to live, we're egging them on to hurry up and die! (Well I was) the kids were really annoying as well. Although it doesn't help when the story actually doesn't go anywhere. Running away from the wind is something that isn't intense of frightening in the least. Then there's this stupid sub-plot with this stupid man going to find his wife which quickly goes down the pan! That was very unnecessary.Probably the worst factory was the acting, I don't know why Mark Wharlberg is in so much stuff because he can't act for a toffee apple! The woman was really wooden as well (don't know her name) the love for each other didn't come across I'm afraid. That crazy granny was also actually unintentionally hilarious! When she was smashing her head through those windows it just looked insane, and completely daft.So if you want a plot that goes nowhere, doesn't know what it wants to be and is as unstructured as this review, then get your glad rags on because you're in for the night of your life!",2,0,1,24 July 2011
The Witch," A future horror classic
","This ain't no Hocus Pocus kids! Witches aren't usually the first port of call when coming up with horror film ideas. They work well with family film's like Nicholas Roeg's surreal adaptation of Roald Dhal's The Witches but can cackling old women with pointy hats and broomsticks scare grown adults? After seeing Robert Egger's striking debut, the answer would seem to be a resounding yes. The Witch is the best horror film since Kill List and is sure to become a future horror classic. I like to think of myself as a hardened horror movie nut but The Witch did actually manage to scare me, more so than the recent It Follows and The Babadook.It's a fairytale for adults and Robert Egger goes down alleys as dark as a film can get. Within the first five or ten minutes, I could tell that I'd be in for a stunning ride as we're treated to some seriously nightmarish imagery involving a naked old woman smothering herself in the blood of a baby, accompanied by a screeching score which is sure to give you the shivers. Terrifying sequences like this appear sporadically through the film so it never feels overdone, it just adds to the mounting tension in each scene until it explodes into the most wonderfully indulgent finale.A lot of films set in medieval times can be a bit trying. A Field in England and Black Death both felt like the setting let the film down by getting bogged down in confusing olde worlde Shakespearean-esque language. However, The Witch is never anything more than compelling throughout. The sole focus of the film is the family and all the parts are acted beautifully by the relatively unknown cast. The audience becomes incredibly involved and invested in the characters so you care about what's going to happen to them. There's a sense of dread in every scene but you're never quite sure about what's going to happen next which makes for unpredictable and absorbing viewing.I can't talk about The Witch without mentioning just how gorgeous the film looks. You could pretty much take any shot and hang it up for display in a gallery because it's just beautiful to look at. The eerie shots of the deep wood reminded me of Lars Von Trier's equally unsettling, Antichrist, however The Witch has a more fantastical quality to the images which adds to the Brothers Grimm fairytale kind of vibe. There isn't a second in the film's tight 90 minute running time where a shot doesn't ooze atmosphere. It's so refreshing to get a horror film which doesn't rely on a few seconds of gore to shock the audience, but actually takes it time to conjure up genuinely frightening images. There's stuff in this film which won't leave my head for a long time after viewing it.Equally as atmospheric as the imagery is the sound. I can't think of a more striking score or sound design since The Shining and it helps a lot to generate such an unsettling atmosphere. The exceedingly creepy dissonant violins and loud chants build scenes up to a shattering intensity where I found myself holding my breath. In fact, the whole film has such a strange and unnerving quality to it. It feels like you're watching something you shouldn't. It's no wonder that the film's even been endorsed by the Satanic Temple itself with the Temple's spokesperson calling it 'a trans-formative Satanic experience.' The Witch has to be my favourite film of the year and one of my favourite horror films full stop. I found it absolutely captivating and full of tension from beginning to end. It's pretty much as perfect as horror can get and exudes the quality of a classic chiller from the 60's. Robert Eggers is definitely going to be a director to look out for in the future. He's proved to critics that the horror genre is alive and well and can still genuinely scare the hell out of people. The Witch is a sensational experience for the eyes and ears, it's cinema at its finest. It is a delicious masterpiece of horror.",10,8,16,2 May 2016
12 Years a Slave," 12 minutes of heartbreak (plus an extra 140)
","Steve Mcqueen is proving himself to be a director to look out for. I wasn't a huge fan of his debut, Hunger, as I found it too pro-IRA and slow. However, I thought that the directing was pretty outstanding and it had a distinct style. Shame is a film I've yet to see, but I've heard plenty of rave reviews. 12 Years a Slave looks to be Mcqueen's masterpiece. It's film-making at it's most effective and powerful. I cam away from the film feeling incredibly moved as I sat there in silence along with the rest of the crowd as the credits came up. 12 Years a Slave dares to bare all in a way that most mainstream films would be afraid of doing. Mcqueen shows all the unflinching brutality to create an overwhelming sense of power. I'm used to watching harrowing and depressing films, but these are normally little known like, Dancer in the Dark and The Seventh Continent. 12 Years a Slave is very much mainstream, yet I still found it incredibly harrowing and brutal. Mainstream audiences are go to in for a nasty shock.The film itself has the look of a classic. Like other modern masterpieces such as, There Will Be Blood and Black Swan, the film looks grainy and the cinematography is quite beautiful. You can almost feel the scorching sun dripping off the screen. The directing is near perfection. Mcqueen goes for an art house vibe without over doing it. He keeps the camera deathly still when filming most of the brutality, such as the unflinching whipping of Solomon near the beginning of the film. This distance adds an added emotional punch for the audience as we're forced to feel every lash on his back. Equally as uncomfortable is the scene where Solomon has been left to hang and we're forced to watch him trying to stand on his tip toes for what feels like an eternity.Another impressive aspect of the film is the stellar performances. Chiwetel is hugely convincing in the lead as the wrongly enslaved Solomon Northup. We feel his pain as he's able to draw such emotion without even saying a word. Michael Fassbender is astounding as the evil plantation owner who treats his slaves as the vermin of the Earth. Fassbender manages to pull off a convincing deep south accent, although his Irish twang is very much still trying to come out. Lupita is also distressing to watch as the slave who has lost all hope, she especially impresses in the greatest scene of the film (more on that later). The supporting cast are all brilliant also. Paul Dano is deliciously evil and Benedict Cumberbatch offers a rare glimpse of humanity among the rich slave owners.12 Years a Slave is a film not to enjoy, but to endure. Many people would fail to see the point in going to see a film which isn't entertaining in the slightest, but I'm not one of those people. I love films which are brave, powerful and deeply emotional. The story of Solomon is a grippingly harrowing one and Steve Mcqueen forces you to watch some disturbing, yet important scenes and directs with a shattering sense of realism. The stand-out moment in the film for me was the whipping of Patsey. This scene possesses so much power and it's enough to break your heart. Mcqueen directs the scene in one long take and the emotion of it all is almost too much to bear. The grisly effects make is all the more harrowing.Another thing I loved about the film was the fantastic music. It's unsettling at times, whether it be the strange drum music on the slave boat or the haunting lyrics to Paul Dano's solo song. However, the main score is the most shattering and only served to elevate the raw emotion it portrays on the screen. It came as no surprise to see Hans Zimmer's name appear on the end credits as he is one of the greatest cinematic composers of all time in my opinion.12 Years a Slave is not an easy film to watch, but it's an important one. If you don't feel deeply moved or depressed when it's finished, then you must be Edwin Epps. It's all the more tragic that this film is true and something like this happened for a long time. It could've very easily become sentimental in its last emotional scene, but Mcqueen made it feel real and removed all the Hollywood gloss to create much more of an impact. It won the best picture Oscar and deservedly so. I can't help but feel that it should've won more though and it's shocking to see that it wasn't even nominated for best cinematography. 12 Years a Slave is harrowing cinema at its very best. Even if you just see it once. Be sure to see it.",10,4,6,19 March 2014
There Will Be Blood," There is a classic
","I heard a lot of praise and superlatives for There Will Be Blood with critics calling it a 'masterpiece' a 'classic' and Daniel Day Lewis' performance being hailed as one of the best performances in cinematic history. Thus my expectations were high and surprisingly they were met. There Will Be Blood astonished me right from its sublime opening. We're introduced to a fabulous shot of somewhat threatening desert mountains with The Shining-esque dissident music playing over it, immediately giving the film a sinister quality. Then we're showed the corruption of Daniel Plainview as he discovers oil by accident and elaborately draws it out, presented entirely with no dialogue, just striking direction and visuals. It's a gripping sequence and the film doesn't let up from there.Let's start with the visuals. There Will Be Blood features some of the most stunning cinematography I've ever witnessed. Sometimes it looked as though it was a stunning oil painting (pun kind of intended) with awe-inspiring shots of landscape, almost eating up our anti-hero. Daniel is often presented in raw close-ups like the characters in Les Miserables, giving him a domineering look throughout the film. Daniel is so powerful that he even controls when the film is going to end with a haunting, 'I'm finished.' Paul Thomas Anderson (who's works I've never seen before) directs with amazement. There are often very few camera shots, focusing on the intensity of our protagonist.And let's face it, There Will Be Blood succeeds so spectacularly because of it's terrifically memorable main character. At it's heart, There Will Be Blood is a character study and an intense one at that. Daniel is basically in every scene and he's a compelling character to watch. At first I felt admiration for his ambition, but then we see him turn into someone totally ruthless, filled with greed and anger. I also loved how the two contrasting characters of Daniel and the preacher interacted. The preacher thinks he's some sort of God, whereas Daniel could be alluded to Satan, however in the end the preacher and Daniel are nigh on opposite sides of the same coin.Of course, the character of Daniel Plainview is made all that more compelling thanks to the other Daniel that's playing him. Daniel Day Lewis is truly electrifying and is up there with Heath Ledger's stonking performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight. He has a wonderful charisma about him, he's a great public speaker and has great ambition. However, he turns into someone almost psychotic. I found the final moments to be the most memorable and haunting as we see Daniel in the future, clearly succeeded, but has he? It's here that Daniel Day Lewis is at his most intense and jaw-dropping, helped by the wonderful writing.The screenplay is a tour-de-force of writing. It sometimes reminded me of Quentin Tarantino as it often featured long scenes of dialogue, but written with such suspense it made it all the more gripping. All the characters are developed wonderfully, but of course it's Daniel that we're focused on most. The directing also reminded me of Stanley Kubrick at times, filled with atmosphere and dread just like the extraordinary, The Shining. One of the most intense sequences features Daniel getting baptised in Church in order to secure an oil deal. It's jaw-dropping to watch as one of my favourite critics Chris Tookey pointed out that Daniel is full of rage, yet also genuinely calling out to God. It's quite heart-breaking.After seeing There Will Be Blood I thought that it deserved a definite 9/10. However, it's been almost 48 hours after watching it and it's still swimming around in my head. I also felt utterly compelled to buy it on blu-ray (as I catched the film on the telly) which is certainly telling. Thus, I have to give it the perfect 10/10 as it just resonates in your mind. Plus it just feels right to do so at the moment. There Will Be Blood is an unforgettable film which you'll either get or you won't. I loved the atmospheric music and atmosphere which prevailed throughout the film. Daniel Day Lewis gives an astonishing performance, playing one of the best characters in the film world. It's final moments completely amazed me and immediately made me want to see it again as it's heft two and a half hour running time flew by. There Will Be Blood is a true masterpiece and an utter modern classic not to be missed!",10,5,7,19 March 2013
Burlesque," A little bit of glitz, a little bit of glamour and a little bit of CHER!
","I normally like to watch dark and depressing films with a lot of substance, so every now and then you need a film like 'Burlesque' to blow away the cobwebs and replace them with flashing lights and catchy tunes for your own entertainment. 'Burlesque' is the exact opposite to what I normally watch and I loved every minute of it! 'Burlesque' is a breath of camp fresh air, it's full of life and style. Everything is just a joy to watch, from Christina's raunchy routines to Cher's incredible one-liners, 'Burlesque' has got it all. The obvious highlight for me has to be the wonderful Cher! She made this film as the stressed-out club owner, giving out some hilarious one-liners like 'How many times have I held your head above the toilet as you threw up everything but your memories' what does that even mean? It doesn't even make sense and that is why she is just hilarious! Cher's acting is also superb, I've never seen her act before but she is fantastic and very likable indeed.However, it's not all rosy, because although Cher belts out an incredible power ballad that puts Christina's voice to shame (the bloody Cher wannabee!) Cher only gets to sing two songs! The first one being her in some very risqué clothing for an 80 year old (still looking fresh Cher). This is the Christina show and although she is actually a pretty good actress and bearable singer, she is just no match for Cher. Whenever Christina is on her own your just waiting for your next Cher fix because she has all the best lines and also is THE best character in the film.'Burlesque' is also incredibly cliché. It has read all the rom com musicals in the business because 'Burlesque' is something you could read like a book! but still, this only adds to the entertainment factor and you can't help but enjoy it more because of it.The directing and cinematography surprised me, with most of the dance and song sequences being filmed really well, and although the plot is something we've all seen before the script is hilarious at times and Stanley Tucci is also funny as Cher's gay friend/colleague.As I've said, 'Burlesque' is a hugely enjoyable show, performed on a stage full of likable style and remarkable glitz (whatever that means). It boasts great acting (Cher), catchy songs (Christina), powerful voices (Cher) as well as unintentional hilarious lines. I shouldn't really like this mega camp-fest but I loved every minute of it.",8,0,1,13 July 2011
Whiplash," Black Swan for drummers
","The types of films I love the most are the ones with a real raw intensity. Black Swan is definitely the most intense film experience I've had with Darren Aronofsky's chaotic direction becoming almost suffocating at times. It's a film which I endlessly admire, as is his second feature, Requiem for a Dream which features a similar intensity with an added emotional punch to the ribs. Whiplash is a film with that same kind of intensity. It's rare to find a film which grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the credits, but Whiplash manages to do more than that. It actually tightens the grip as the film goes on until you're just about choking by the end of it all!Whilst I don't think that Whiplash is quite the perfect masterpiece many people have made it out to be, there's no denying that it's an absolutely stellar and riveting film. It does for drumming, what Black Swan did for ballet. Imagine if Natalie Portman wanted to be the most perfect drummer in the world and Vincent Cassel was a shouty and overbearing bully pushing her way beyond the limits of human capacity and you have Whiplash.The film relies a lot on Damien Chazelle's exhilarating direction. He manages to bring scene after scene of gripping intensity which seems to build and build until the electrifying finale. He directs the drumming performances with lots of close-ups and quick cuts which end up leaving you feeling completely exhausted. On top of that you've got JK Simmons shouting at the top of his lungs at the students and wearing them out until they physically bleed. There's a scene early on where he picks on someone who's out of tune and it almost made me want to cry like the poor kid he was picking on.JK totally earned his Oscar here. It's a frightening and wildly intimidating performance full of passion and force. His presence fills every scene he's in and dares you not to take your eyes off of him. Miles Teller, who plays the protagonist drummer boy, is also very good in the role. He manages to be very convincing and you can't help but root for him to do well. He has an infectious passion for the drums and an admirable ambition. Although, if I was in his shoes I'd kick the drums into touch and take that girl and run!The idea of watching a film about an ambitious drummer trying to make it in a jazz band isn't an appealing one. It's down to Damien's superb directing and writing skills which make it utterly compelling. It's also incredibly unpredictable. There are so many twists and turns in the final 20 minutes that you have no idea how it's going to end. I also quite liked how it ended fairly ambiguously. The final scene is truly extraordinary to watch and extremely similar to Black Swan's final scene. It's so intense that it has your fingernails digging into the person you're sitting next to and your heart thumping like a steam train.There are a couple of problems which stop it from being perfect. I thought that the plot lacked more focus which could've added to the intensity of it all. In Black Swan we're made very aware of the days passing to the final performance and so when it arrives we feel almost as nervous as Nina! With Whiplash, it wasn't made clear as to what the jazz band were working towards half the time. At one point I didn't even realise that they were performing in front of an audience! There also felt like a lack of character development. However, ultimately these problems don't detract from the overwhelming experience the film offers.Whiplash is a masterful little film. Made for only one million dollars and shot in less than 30 days, Damien Chazelle has showed the world that he possesses an undeniable talent for filmmaking. It's a sensational debut and I defy anyone not to come out by the end of it feeling exhausted. It may not be everyone's idea of entertainment, but for those who are into dark, psychological and intense films then Whiplash is the film to see. I really look forward to going through it all again.Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com",9,1,5,27 February 2015
Inception," Only dreams are made of this!
","I've regretted not seeing 'Inception' on the big screen. I could've seen it at my local cinema (lovely little place, and cheap too!) But I suppose I didn't bother to save hassle. Also, I didn't quite realise how much of a positive buzz this film was getting until after the screening stopped (they only put films up for about two days, they're bloody ridiculous). By seeing this now only reinforces that regret, because it would've been an absolutely stunning spectacle to see on a fairly large screen with fairly loud sound. It would've left me even more speechless.The biggest complaints without a doubt 'Inception' receives are about it being absolutely, completely and utterly confusing. Their is no denying that 'Inception' is probably the most confusing film I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan throws you straight into the deep end with his script and visuals, as Leonardo explains in the 'simplest' terms about what this dream manipulation malarkey is about. In a way you have to sort of understand it for yourself which is sure to put some people off, but please don't let it. My parents gave up on it immediately as it started, you must be willing to understand and actually want to understand otherwise you will have absolutely no hope.I think that Christopher Nolan is an absolutely brilliant director and writer. I've seen and loved 'Insomnia', 'Batman Begins' and 'Memento' which have all required viewers participation (well mostly 'Memento') they all show off his talent as a writer. 'Inception' is probably not only his biggest and most complex spectacle to date, but THE biggest and most complex spectacle to date. I do not know how this came from his mind, either he's insane or a complete genius. I think that he's a complete genius as there's no way anyone could ever think up such a weave of ideas and present them in such a brilliant way of story-telling. It's impossible. Christopher is absolutely incredible. So incredible that I don't think that he even understood what he was writing! It's not only his writing but also his vision. It's absolutely gorgeous to look at with mind-blowing special effects that make you as the viewer feel disorientated. The scene in which Paris folds over is already one of the most iconic scenes in movie-making history and it's easy to see why. The special effects are just breath-taking. As is the beautiful cinematography, shown off to dazzling effect in the 'Hotel level' and 'Snow level'. 'Inception' is the type of film that craves the blu-ray quality it deserves.What sets 'Inception' aside from other films is it's sheer brilliance in its writing. It is probably the cleverest film I've ever seen, with the whole back story of Cobb and Mal that could be a whole separate feature film in itself. It's fascinating and left me completely exhausted by the end of it, with an absolutely brilliant ending if I might add! It leaves it up to the viewer and adds yet another layer of mystery and confusion. The main plot concerns Leo and his team trying to plant a thought into Cillian Murphey's head, which some of it I didn't quite get but I got the gist to care about what was going on. The music is also sensational aspect. It's loud, proud and ultimately adds a fantastical dimension to the film. The music is just another character!The directing is nothing short of perfection. It's even more involving than The Dark Knight, almost hypnotic, not letting you take your eyes of the screen. I've seen it three times now and it seems as if it's getting better with each viewing and you start to notice different things, which just boggles your mind. If this film was directed by, let's say Michael Bay, the action (which is basically the entire final hour and a half) would be shot too close, with hundreds of quick cuts so that you wouldn't be able to see what the heck's going on! Christopher directs with The Dark Knight styled intensity. He uses long-shots more than close-ups to capture the scale of what's going on, it's just extraordinary! The iconic rotating hallway fight is all done in one shot for Christ's sake! It's just incredible! 'Inception' is an absolute masterpiece. It's full of startling visuals, ingenious twists and turns with one of the most original and daring plots in decades. Did I understand it? No, did I care? No, not really, I understood enough to care and was ultimately blown away. It's quite simply one of the best films ever made, it gets into the head of the protagonist, making you really sympathise for him. I even found myself being profoundly moved in some scenes! Like, 'Black Swan', 'Inside', 'Shutter Island' it left me breathless, in awe and made me feel. Watch it. It's worth it.",10,1,16,16 November 2011
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Well that kicked Private Ryan's arse!
","When I slipped in the disc for Brotherhood I expected a really good war film. I didn't expect to be sitting on the sofa with my eyes filled with tears by the end of it, and convinced that I'd just seen one of the very best war films ever. My love for Korean films is unabashed. Whilst Korean horror is what I go for most, I have also tried and loved some of their explosive thrillers like, The Man from Nowhere and A Bittersweet Life. War films aren't really my thing though. My favourite war film is probably Inglorious Basterds, but even that isn't really interested in showing us battle sequences.What's fantastic about Brotherhood is that it puts its characters first. In fact, this is what the majority of Korean films tend to do and I think that's the secret to their brilliance. With Brotherhood, I was gripped by every battle sequence because I cared about the people who were in them. It's a real epic which spans across the entire length of the Korean War, as well as briefly showing us before and after events take place. If someone said to me 'oh, this is a movie about the Korean War' I'd immediately switch off because war movies just don't interest me. Brotherhood makes you interested right from the very start. The first half an hour is dedicated to events before the war. We see two fantastically likable brothers who are devoted to their family. Some may find it overly sentimental, however for me it worked. I immediately cared about these characters and was totally gripped from when they're whisked away to fight in the war.The battle sequences are brilliantly intense to watch. The camera does shake a little too much for my liking, but it's really not that much of a distraction. They're intense because you care about what's going to happen to the characters. When a comrade dies you almost feels as much pain as the other characters do. The special effects are also very convincing (apart from the shoddy CGI planes towards the end) and manage to put you right there in the firing line. What's most interesting though is watching the two brothers slowly grow apart from each other. At its heart, Brotherhood is a tragedy. One brother turns into a cold-hearted and ruthless leader, whilst the other remains compassionate. This arc is done gradually and realistically throughout the film and it's what keeps the film so emotional and absorbing. The ruthless brother could've easily come across as a caricature, but thanks to the fantastic writing and acting we're left with convincing character development and remain involved with the character.Various shocking events unfold which have the power to move, however it's the relentlessly melodramatic final twenty minutes which really hit hard. Again, many will find this finale too melodramatic and sentimental, but for me it totally worked. I'm not one to cry in films (the only ones I've shed tears for are Dancer in the Dark and Amour) however, there are several moments towards the end where I had tears REALLY filling up in my eyes. It's incredibly emotional and ultimately powerful.Brotherhood isn't a perfect film, but it's a damn near one. I was never bored for a minute of its hefty 140 minute runtime. I cannot urge people enough to check this out, even if (like me) you aren't into war films. At its core it's a character-driven tragedy with the Korean War used as a mere backdrop. It's ten times better than Saving Private Ryan and if you aren't moved by the time it's over then you truly do have a heart of stone. Brotherhood is a spectacular triumph which needs to be watched for its sheer emotional power.",9,1,2,16 April 2015
The Conjuring," Conjured up one of this years best horror films
","Haunted house movies are really getting old, aren't they? We know all the clichés that have been done to death with creaky doors, ghosts that say 'Boo!' in the night, dark cobweb laden cellars that often end up being dimly lit by a single match. They aren't creepy anymore and they're boring. Well, James Wan has proved this philosophy to be entirely untrue and shows that the haunted house genre is very much still alive and still effective and creepy. The Conjuring does nothing new with the genre, and although this may sound off-putting it really shouldn't be, as it still manages to be one of the best haunted house films of recent memory and quite possibly the best horror film to have come out this year (although You're Next is getting closer!) The Conjuring has a great 70's vibe to it right from the terrific opening titles that atmospherically crawl up the screen after the creepy opening involving a possessed doll. Most films that proclaim to be true stories are largely fabricated, but The Conjuring is an exception as it is based on the case files of real life investigators of the paranormal, Lorraine and Ed Warren (played brilliantly by Mr.Wilson and Miss.Farmiga). The writers had been in touch with the real Lorraine Warren during the writing process, and whilst the film has taken liberties, Lorraine proclaims the events depicted in the film to be largely true which makes the film all the more creepy.I liked how the first half of the film balances the lives of the haunted Perron family and the investigative Warren family. This makes the second half of when the Warren's become involved all the more involving. Usually in these types of films (and even in James Wans' very own Insidious) the investigators are thrown in towards the end to get rid of the problem. The Conjuring feels much more authentic in this respect as we gain insight into their lives which show them as ordinary people. Of course, the Perron family moving in are of course the more interesting aspect of the first half, which is why more focus is given to them, and wisely so.The Conjuring is constantly gripping thanks to the continuous scares it delivers. Unfortunately I never felt scared like I did in, say, Insidious or Sinister, but The Conjuring definitely did have one or two moments that creeped me out. James Wan is a master behind the camera and knows exactly how to conjure up (see what I did there?) suspense and a very strong creepy atmosphere. Instead of using close-ups and quick-cuts that make it impossible to see what's going on, James uses long shots that are largely in one take that are so much more effect. A scare is ultimately like a punch line to a joke, and more often than not the punch-line is scares fails to deliver, but The Conjuring does. The use of silences and sounds is also very effective indeed and especially works well in a cinema or, I would assume, with a surround sound system. I'm fairly sure that had I watched this on my own in the dark, I would've been scared.One stand-out scene for me involves the mother playing 'hide and clap' with her youngest daughter. This scene shows off James' talents to a tee and is one of the creepiest scenes in the entire film. After a slow, but never boring first half things begin to heat up more in the second half when the Warrens come in to investigate which acuminates to a thrilling finale where you really care about what happens to the characters. Some people say that the finale is a little too Hollywood, but I found it effective and thrilling within the contents of the film and it also delivered some creepy images.So although The Conjuring offers nothing new, it really doesn't matter. James Wan delivers the frights so effectively that you'll feel like you've never seen anything like it before. It's old-school horror done right. However, I didn't quite like it as much as Sinister, which I found scarier or James' previous ghost story, Insidious which I also found scarier than this one. However, I was also a fan of Insidious' controversial third half, so people who disliked that about Insidious will without a doubt enjoy The Conjuring more. It's refreshing to see a genuinely creepy haunted house film as there have been so many duds such as: The Pact, Darkness and that terrible UK TV show, Lightfields that just do not know how to creep out an audience! Whilst The Conjuring may not frighten the hardest horror fans, some parts might just get under your skin. The film is well worth seeing anyway just for the wonderful directing, acting, special effects and set design. This is a very solid ghost story and I look forward to James Wan's imminent sequel to Insidious.",8,1,3,16 August 2013
Scream," Send yourself a copy
","I'm a sucker for a slasher. I even like the bad ones like 'Halloween: Resurrection' and 'Urban Legends: Final Cut' but to me they're really fun and often have a really cool twist ending. So when an actual good slasher comes along, I'm all over it. As soon as 'Scream' starts with its tremendous opening, you know you're in for a really fun and interesting film with originality. 'Scream' ticks all the boxes and is probably the best slasher film ever! Wes Craven's known for his 'Nightmare on Elm St.', 'The Hills Have Eyes' and such. All have been OK, but I think Wes has really found his place in the teen slasher genre. He makes it fun and original with the help of the excellent writers who are actually really clever at creating irony plus funny lines and characters.The thing that holds a slasher together is its characters and 'Scream' has really memorable characters. Courtney Cox is a delight as the originally annoying TV presenter that eventually turns into someone who we actually really like. David Arquette is also really funny as Deputy Dewey the policeman. In fact the whole cast is brilliantly fun, including Matthew Lillard who is suitably hammy as the friend of the group.Aside from the memorable characters and sharp wit, 'Scream' is also really exciting and suspenseful. There's even a chase scene that lasts a good 15 minutes. A rarity where nowadays its a quick 2 second chase in the woods. The cinematography and camera movements are also really interesting. The camera sometimes has this dream-like quality to it that suits the film really well. 'Scream' never gets dull, it's tense and exciting right up to the shocking end twist that really fulfills your expectations.'Scream' grasps you by the throat from the minute it starts and doesn't let go. It's memorable and really exciting fun. If you're a fan of slashers like me then 'Scream' should be at the top of your list. The sequels are quite good as well, especially the incredible latest instalment 'Scream 4' that is probably on par with this incredible original. Horror fans should also really appreciate the references to classic horror films throughout the film. Don't answer the phone, don't open the door, just go onto ebay and click 'buy it now!'",10,15,16,25 August 2011
Paths of Glory," Stanley's first moment of glory
","Paths of Glory is a World War 1 film with a difference. It's less concerned with the actual trench warfare and more concerned with the sadism found in higher ranking officers. It's clear that Stanley isn't a fan of war, so it may be a little biased, but it is based on a true story and Stanley handles it absolutely beautifully!After the limp Killer's Kiss and entertaining, The Killing, Paths of Glory is Stanley's first truly great film. You can see his directing style really shine here with the fantastic tracking shots and wide angles. If you look at most films from the 50's you'll find that the camera barely moves. Here, the camera is always on the move which is partly why the film still holds up so well today.It's the type of film which makes your blood boil. There is no conventional happy ending, the entire film is on the road to tragedy. There are several brilliant scenes which stand the test of time including the storming of the Ant Hill, which adds a kind of surreal grace to a scene full of ugliness and intensity. Another great scene is the infuriating kangaroo court where Kirk Douglas hopelessly tries to defend the 'cowardly' soldiers.The most memorable moments are probably the final two scenes though. The first one features a long and melodramatic walk to the firing line. There's obvious religious imagery here and it's handled magnificently. The last scene is the famous moment in the bar where Stanley's beautiful wife takes the stage and gets a bunch of rowdy soldiers to hum in unison. It's a weirdly moving moment to end on.I'm not a particular fan of war films, but Paths of Glory has to be one of the best out there. It has a terrific story to tell and it's one which will anger and sadden you. It's superbly acted and directed too. Some say that it's Stanley Kubrick's best film. I'd disagree with that statement, but I can see where these people are coming from. It definitely has to be his most emotional and moving film.",8,0,2,26 February 2015
1408," More like an extreme version of CITV's Scary Sleepover
","I've got to admit, when I saw the trailer for 1408 I thought that it looked a bit naff. OK, so it may have been a few years ago but I can still remember some images that looked slightly try-hard. However, when I saw that my favourite critic gave it 5 stars (usually what he loves, I love) I thought that I should give it a chance. After all, I'm a great fan of the horror genre and the idea of someone trying to survive the night in a haunted hotel room does sound very appealing to me. However, by the end of it the major feeling which I felt was disappointment. Ultimately 1408 was not scary like everyone said it was and I didn't think that the story was strong enough to hold my attention for it's entire running time. However, that's not to say that it's terrible and I regret buying it, because I don't think I do.First off, I loved the build-up. I loved how we followed the likable if not cocky character of John Cusack, I liked how we got to see his work and what he did etc. I also loved the cryptic postcard sending him to room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. I also loved the whole background of the hotel and how it kept us in suspense as to what is so terrible about the room. What I loved the most, and what I think was possibly the best scene in the film, was the confrontation between John Cusack and Samuel L Jackson, the hotel manager. The dialogue was involving and it really made you want to see what was going to happen in that room! The whole build-up to getting to the room in the lift and everything was also brilliant! Of course, a build-up like this which offers great things could easily turn into a let-down, and I'm afraid that that's what it ultimately did.The simplicity of the room was wonderful. There seemed to be nothing out of the ordinary with it and nothing spooky happened for a while, until the digital clock turns into a countdown. Now I was thinking that this is when things are about to pick up and poor old John Cusack is going to have the night of his life! Which he does, but unfortunately I didn't get the night of my life. For me it almost seemed like an unfunny version of the Evil Dead 2 at times. With it aborting to cheap and clichéd haunted house scares such as the wall suddenly being cracked and blood coming through it, the clock working even though it's unplugged etc. It even seemed desperate at times to scare you such as with the living corpse in the pipey thing, but it's something we've all seen before and seen much better.1408 sort of became repetitive, with the room constantly changing, showing how it's messing with John Cusack's mind without really having much to say. I felt that it had similar themes and ideas that were explored much, much more effectively and emotionally in Shutter Island. However, the film was undeniably effective at getting inside John's head. I felt that I was going as crazy as he was at times! There's a wonderfully claustrophobic atmosphere and sense of entrapment. The room was also incredibly cruel at times, which I liked (not in a sick way). I also have to admit that the directing and camera-work was superb, it never made you feel bored about being in the room, it was just the room's constant mind blows that became boring. It did make me feel dizzy at times and for that I applaud it.It's just a shame that the story wasn't strong enough! The whole idea with the flashbacks was wonderful, but there simply wasn't enough there to sustain attention. In the end it just became a film showing off its big budget with endless gimmicks that became tiresome and not at all scary. 1408 does however have redeeming factors, and it did effectively eff my mind, but I was ultimately left feeling disappointed and I think that the film could've offered me more. In addition, John Cusack did give a really brilliant performance as Stephen King adaptations often do. However I'd stick to the likes of The Shining, Misery and Carrie, for this is unfortunately not up there with them.",6,0,0,29 December 2012
X-Men: First Class," Should go straight to the chokey!
","I should probably start by saying that this is my first X Men movie. They've never interested me before and neither has any superhero movie really. I've never seen Captain America, Thor or even The Avengers which everyone seems to rave about. I just find them a bit silly and geeky. If I was 10 years younger or a fan boy then I might like them, but I'm not. I'm not completely against superhero films though. Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy features two of my favourite films of all time (TDK and TDKR) but they have an element of realism and are just exceptionally made.I decided to give First Class a go because everyone was raving about the latest X Men film, Days of Future Past. Plus, I had heard a lot of great things about First Class and it was directed by Matthew Vaughn who directed the brilliant Kick-Ass (another comic book film I actually really like). However, this film really didn't live up to its hype.I just don't understand all the love for this film. I found it pretty laughable from the moment it started with the terrible child actors and melodrama verging on parody. The moment where Erik's mother gets shot by Nazi Kevin Bacon (no, I'm not making that up) should've been heart-breaking and really emotional, but the scene just ended up being a joke! The bombastic music, the over-acting from the kid and Kevin Bacon and the rushed directing just meant that I couldn't take the film seriously. Unfortunately the rest of the film continues in this manner.First Class is definitely a film only kids or fan boys would appreciate. It's so daft and contrived with flat characters. Kevin Bacon is a complete caricature as the villain and the X men themselves are also very cartoony. James McAvoy's character was particularly obnoxious, although I did enjoy Michael Fassbender's slightly more complex character of Erik, who ends up turning into a caricature villain for little reason.Even though the film is over two hours in length it still feels very rushed and withdrawn. The constant globe-trotting meant that you never knew exactly where you are or what's going on! The screenplay is also terribly contrived and very cheesy. All of the dialogue feels incredibly forced and I couldn't help but curl my toes with the end line where Michael Fassbender says, 'No not Erik... I'm Magneto!' Some of the imagery was also just downright bizarre! A man puts his head in a fish tank and grows gills whilst a stripper flutters about with fairy wings whilst shooting fire from her mouth! I don't know what the writers were smoking, but I'd try some!I also found the film quite sexist. It seemed compulsory for all the female characters to show as much leg as possible, even those who worked in the FBI. The FBI agent even goes a step further by stripping down to her bra and pants to covertly follow a bunch of prostitutes into a location. Most, if not all the female characters were objectified in some way and I found it a little depressing. Jennifer Lawrence's sexy blue character was even given ageless cells or something, which explains why she doesn't age in the later films, even though the men do because otherwise she wouldn't be sexy anymore.Most of the action relied on CGI and a lot of it looked pretty appalling and I think it will age extremely badly in a few years time. Having said that, I did quite enjoy how off the wall the action scenes were, especially the last half hour where a submarine levitates out of the ocean, an anchor slices a ship in half and fifty missiles are deflected back into the ocean. It's just insane, and so daft that it's actually really fun to watch.I was never bored during First Class because it was very entertaining, but not in a good way. It was kind of so bad it was good and I started to have fun counting all of the contrived and cheesy lines. I find it baffling how seriously well-liked this film is though. Everything about this film is very over-the-top from the acting to the action sequences. It's also very poorly written with dull characters making puzzling decisions. The way Jennifer Lawrence's character suddenly joined the bad side wasn't explained at all! First Class is a complete mess, but it's a pretty entertaining one. I won't be wasting any money on Days of Future Past though.",4,4,6,19 June 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," He has risen
","How do you follow up something as incredible as The Dark Knight? Well, get Christopher Nolan to write and direct The Dark Knight Rises of course! I had high expectations after the masterpiece that was The Dark Knight, I wasn't expecting something as masterful, but I was expecting something pretty good. Actually Christopher has created something that is as good as The Dark Knight, if not better. People raved about The Dark Knight forever when it first came out, yet not so many people seem to be raving about this one, which is a shame because it still deserves as much hype. Even my mum who awarded The Dark Knight a dismal 2 stars, said that this one was 5 star brilliance.I thought that The Dark Knight was set on a massive scope, but Rises is something of a spectacle. It completely ups the ante, once the chaos starts the film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go for the entire running time. It's an incredibly long film but never did it feel too long. Its length is entirely justified and I didn't want it to finish. The Dark Knight Rises is a masterpiece, it's thoroughly gripping with fantastic characters. Christian Bale is brilliant as Batman but once again the villain steals the show. Although, no where near as legendary as The Joker, Bane is a truly menacing and utterly psychotic terrorist. Tom Hardy doesn't get any where near enough praise, due to Heath Ledger's phenomenal performance.Having Bane in Rises is a stroke of genius by Christopher Nolan, as he is the opposite of The Joker. Bane is a brutal, hulking figure who is also calm and articulate as well as carrying an incredible presence. He fills every scene with such dread, and speaks with such power. The complaints about not hearing what he's saying are ridiculous. His voice projects much loader than everyone else's and with a menacing Sean Connery-styled accent. He unleashes chaos five times more brutal than The Joker ever did. Rises relishes in its incredible atmosphere of utter hopelessness. A brooding atmosphere projects throughout the final hour and a half, making it incredibly tense and intense.The writing is as intelligent as ever, and much less confusing. The new characters are complex and brilliant. Joseph Gordon Levitt was brilliant, as was Anne Hathaway who could certainly pull off that tight leather catsuit. She was both sexy and powerful. Batman and Catwoman work marvellously together, especially in the intense action sequences. The directing is as awe-inspiring as you'd ever expect. I have the feeling that it would blow your socks off in blu-ray as much as it does on the big screen. Once again it's incredibly involving and thrilling. Its final moments are very intense and enthralling. The whole cinema was on the edge of its seat. Christopher Nolan directs action with such raw intensity unlike any other director I know.The music intensifies everything too. It gave me chills that took a while to go away! Hans Zimmer is a master, cranking up the tension and making everything that much more thrilling. The use of silence was also powerful, notably when the boy was singing the American anthem in the football stadium. The Dark Knight Rises feels epic. Probably even more so than the previous entries in the franchise. Bane's motif is also one of the best scores throughout the whole trilogy! It's intense and completely matches his dominant presence.In conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises left me feeling breathless and drained. It takes you on a journey, and even packed a couple of unexpected twists that left my jaw open. It's not your generic superhero movie, it's lavishly dark, with a highly emotional ending that left me with a few tears brewing in my eyes. It concludes the trilogy perfectly and must be the best trilogy since Toy Story. It is quite simply one of the best films I've ever seen, thanks to its surprising tenderness as well as brutality. It's a film that takes a while to get out of your head. It was thrilling and involving with gorgeously fleshed-out characters and amazing action. I loved it.",10,5,13,8 August 2012
Mother!," House party from hell
","With just six feature films under his belt, Darren Aronofsky is still one of the most innovative and striking directors working in Hollywood today. With his unique visual style he creates intimate stories which have the power to grip you by the throat until the very last shot. 'Black Swan' is probably my favourite film of the last decade so you can imagine my delight at discovering that Darren had been secretly filming Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem in a horror film for God knows how many months. It was a shock well worthy of the cheeky exclamation mark pegged onto the title. It looked as though Darren had returned to his melodramatic roots after spending years working on a forgettable biblical epic.Although 'Mother!' also has biblical overtones, it's perhaps less obvious than watching Noah's ark rock around a stormy ocean. It is interesting to note, however the almighty split of opinions on Aronofsky's latest work of art. People talk all the time about 'marmite' films, where critics and audiences alike seem to adore or outright detest a film for equally valid reasons and 'Mother!' is exactly that. Some find it tedious and ridiculous, whilst others find it gripping and intoxicating in the best possible way. I must admit that when I first saw the film, it completely went against my expectations and I was left sitting in a rare state of shock trying to process what I had just seen. Suffice to say that after about 10 minutes, my opinion landed directly on the 'love it' side of the fence.The less you know about 'Mother!' the better the experience will be so I won't delve into plot points. The biggest surprise for me was discovering how funny the film is. The trailers make it out to be like some sort of hardcore horror movie in the vein of 'Rosemary's Baby' meets 'Repulsion' but I was amazed to find myself laughing so much, particularly in the first half. The preposterousness of the situations make for darkly comic viewing in a similar kind of way to 'Calvaire' a Belgian horror film with equally pitch-black comedy. It could be mistaken for bad writing, but it's entirely intentional. It all comes from the fact that J-Law's character is presented as the only sane person who the audience can relate to, whereas pretty much every other character is totally unrepeatable.The film builds slowly but always intrigues. Just like Natalie Portman's Nina in 'Black Swan' J-Law's titular 'Mother!' character is always shown in tight close-ups with the camera intensely following her every move. It makes for claustrophobic and uncomfortable viewing at times, particularly as the action never moves away from the house, which makes the insane third act work even more effectively for it. The point of view is also very subjective, it's made clear that Jennifer isn't quite right in the head and we see all her strange and horrifying delusions as if we were in her shoes. It's fantastically focused filmmaking (nice bit of alliteration there for you) which helps to build up the intensity.The first half might seem more than a bit weird to most moviegoers but it isn't anything compared to the hysterical second half which has to contain some of the most insane sequences ever committed to film. I won't go into details but I was left feeling incredibly stressed and bemused which is exactly how the film wants you to feel. Visually it's astonishing and some of the camera-work is dizzyingly terrific. It also contains some seriously shocking content which left my mouth agape and I'm someone who considers themselves to be a hardened horror nut. It's the kind of big budget surrealism which is devastatingly lacking in Hollywood. Of course none of it is supposed to be taken at face value and there are plenty of metaphors to chew over after the film has finished. It's just a shame that Darren and Jennifer have been so open about what the film is actually about as it means that the sense of mystery has gone already. The film could've and should've been left up to interpretation. Directors such as David Lynch and Michael Haneke would never dream of telling audiences what their films are about because every audience member's ideas are valid and have meaning to them. Anyhow, although the metaphors and symbolism are a little heavy- handed in the film, they are no less brilliant and intelligent.It's also worth mentioning the excellent performances in the film. Although that really doesn't come as a surprise when you have heavyweights like Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem and Michelle Pfeiffer starring all in the same film. Each role is very challenging though and the fact that they all pulled each part off and made it believable is a credit to them. The real star of the show though is Darren Aronofsky whose directing style manages to unequivocally sweep audiences away on a mad, horrifying journey which isn't soon forgotten. 'Mother!' is a very special film. It's divisive but most great works of art are. You will get a strong reaction, no matter who you are or what that reaction might be.",9,0,2,13 October 2017
The Greatest Showman," Great Show!
","'Ladies and gents, this is the moment you've waited for' are the first words Hugh Jackman warbles in this box office smash hit. I'm not entirely sure that the world has been waiting for a jazz-handed, all-singing, all-dancing musical about P.T Barnum (the man who invented the business of show) but the audience numbers prove otherwise. Like a bad penny, Jackman's returned to the world of musicals, only he's looking a little happier in this one compared to Tom Hooper's sprawling adaptation of Les Miserables and his voice is sounding a little better too! Or is that just the autotune? 
Either way, Jackman and the rest of the cast look like they're having the time of their lives in Michael Gracey's infectiously joyous debut. I must admit to being a little apprehensive about seeing it, fearing the worst for a High School Musical-esque cheese-fest, but was immediately drawn in by the spectacular visuals and mighty music. From start to finish, The Greatest Showman does what P.T Barnum knew how to do best, entertain. The film moves at a glorious pace, piling on the impressive images and sounds until your senses feel overwhelmed. Gracey displays great skill and confidence from behind the camera, at best it displays similarities to Baz Luhrmann's musical masterpiece, Moulin Rouge! It's hard to believe that this is a film from a first-time director.
Unfortunately it's the screenplay by Jenny Bicks and Oscar-winner Bill Condon which stop this show from soaring to the heights of Zendaya's pink-haired trapeze artist. The story is undeniably cliché and predictable. It's the rags to riches tale we've all seen countless times before, only this time with more song and dance routines. The film almost peaks too early by rushing through Barnum's rise to stardom and then not giving our hero much to do through the rest of the running time. A flat love story is introduced between Zac Efron (who remains fully-clothed for once) and Zendaya but neither character is developed enough for us to care what happens. Shock, horror, Hugh gets too fame obsessed and ends up neglecting his wife and children only to realise his sins in the end so we can neatly tie a bow and let the credits roll. There are also moments of sugary sentimentality enough to make even the soppiest person cringe.
But in the end none of that matters, The Greatest Showman is a pleasure of the guiltiest kind. It knows exactly what kind of film it is and it does it very well. There isn't a duff song in the film, although that's no surprise given that the lyrics were penned by the duo who wrote for last year's stupendous La La Land. The choreography is also top-notch, daring you not to take your eyes away from the screen. Despisers of musicals might want to steer clear, but those who are a sucker for a catchy showtune will undoubtedly find a lot to admire. It's perhaps not something I'd shout from the rooftops and ruin my street cred, but I was a big fan and strangely I can't wait to see it again.",8,0,1,29 January 2018
Monsters University," Pixar's most underrated?
","Apart from Cars and Cars 2 I have seen every Pixar film and I love them. Pixar is one of those rare studios that produce consistently brilliant work that rank up against some of cinemas finest. Pixar manage to craft a film that can appeal to grown ups as much (or even more so) than its intended child audience. What I find annoying is that people keep banging on about a dip in quality from Pixar, and whilst I admit that their last effort, Brave was there worst as it took a direction away from the adult audience, and tried to appeal more to children, however it was still undeniably beautiful to look at and by no means a bad film. Also, let's remember that two of Pixar's absolute best films (Up and Toy Story 3) only came out less than five years ago! So people worrying about a dip in quality really shouldn't worry. Besides Monsters University still ranks up there with the best of them.I have no idea where these complaints for Monsters University are coming from. I know the reception hasn't been that bad, but the critics haven't been madly praising it like they do with other Pixar classics, which it deserves to be. When I was a child Monsters Inc. was my absolute favourite film. To this day I sleep in a Monsters Inc. duvet and I am now eighteen years old and totally unashamed. Monsters Inc. is one of Pixar's most creative and funniest films and to have a prequel to allow you to enter back into that hilarious and colourful world is an offer only those with the coldest hearts could refuse. The film is Pixar through and through right from the adorable opening which focuses on toddler and loner Mike dreaming of being a scarer, despite his cute looks. It's a sad, funny, engaging and cute opening which had me assured that this was going to be no flop.Almost every single shot of Monsters University is filled to the brim with colour, life and creativity. If you look in the background you'll see something different going on. The visuals are spectacular, making this a must buy on Blu-ray. As always with Pixar there is a lot of creativity going on. Pixar recognises that there are endless opportunities for animation and they use this to the absolute best that they can. There are breath taking moments such as the hazardous (and hilarious) tunnel race where monsters must run in a pitch black tunnel only lighted by glowing balls of sting. Another visual highlight, which I won't spoil, features a terrifying librarian which I found incredibly creative, funny and also very tense. The animation is as top notch as ever.What makes Monsters University the perfect prequel is that it doesn't rely on characters and ideas created from Monsters Inc. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of nods and references but not enough to detract from Monsters University. It works perfectly well as a stand alone film and a companion to the original masterpiece. Monsters University introduces a brilliant array of new and very likable characters. I was loving the film in the beginning where Mike was out of his depth in the scare academy and Sully was starting to become a rival. However, I started to enjoy things even more when Mike puts his scare team, Oozma Kappa, together. Here we meet a brilliant batch of new characters who will stay with you long after the credits roll. All of them are brilliantly funny in their own way and everyone's favourite will be different, although personally I enjoyed the mature octopus-like student.Some people moan about the thin plot, but the plot really didn't bother me. Monsters University relies more on its characters who are all strong and carry the film perfectly. Admittedly the narrative is simple, yet it's engaging and had me cheering the team on! I really didn't want Monsters University to end, and when I thought things were wrapping up, it carried on for another 15 minutes which I loved! The finale is very endearing and heart-warming. It's everything you could expect from a Pixar film. It's also hugely exciting and has you thinking 'How the heck are they gonna get out of this!?' I also enjoyed Helen Mirren's hard-nosed Dean Hardscrabble who coldly runs the Scare Academy after beating the all-time scare record (beaten by Sully in the near future of course.) And of course Mike and Sully are as likable as ever. It's fascinating for a Monsters Inc. fan to watch two characters gradually beginning to really like each other. It also has a great moral message to kids about team work and friendship without being patronising.However, I think (like most of Pixar's productions) that Monsters University will be wasted on children. It can very much be enjoyed by adults, it's certainly no chore to sit through. Monsters University is hugely entertaining and may even leave you wanting more. all certainly be buying it on Blu-ray when it's released, whilst critics can ponder until they finally find the hilarity and genius in it. Whilst it isn't quite as good as Monsters Inc. it really isn't far off and is certainly no decline in Pixar's quality.",9,0,0,4 August 2013
Identity," Hard to identify
","Identity starts off brilliantly. It has various flash-backs and flash-forwards to keep you all entertained and works almost as a puzzle. It's clever and engaging and lets us all get to know the wonderful array of characters who obviously end up stranded at a motel. From then on, Identity tries to pull in a slasher element that would work if it actually tried to be a horror film and not just a thriller with killings. I mean, if you look at James Mangold's previous works, '3:10 to Yuma', 'Walk the Line' etc. He's not exactly in touch with the horror genre and that's almost what the film pretends to be.Nevertheless it's very entertaining, but could've been executed better. The cast is great and the writing intelligent. Identity thrives off its characters, all of them different and engaging. You have to have a reaction when one of them gets the chop! The trouble being that the chops aren't very well done. Most of the kills are off-camera and don't generate up a lot of tension. Howver, it's the twist which the film thrives off. It had mixed reactions in my house. I thought it was really clever (although I had accidentally read an element of it before I'd actually seen it) and although something similar is regularly done in today's films (especially the horror genre) it was also buried under other elements which gives the film a whole new edge to it. Some might call it silly and pointless, but I call it original and intelligent.Identity isn't much of a horror film, which is a shame because I'm sure if it was approached as a slasher I'm sure I'd be giving it a solid 8. It does generate thrills but not as many as you might imagine. Perhaps if it was done today, it would've had a better look and feel to it. But that's not to say it's a bad film, because its not. It's genuinely interesting, has fantastic character development and is also extremely atmospheric with its use of pathetic fallacy and claustrophobia. It's worth a see, but don't go expecting something as great as some people like to paint.",7,0,0,3 November 2012
Amélie," a one off!
","From the moment Amelie begins you can be certain whether you are going to like it or not. The quirky sense of style and directing fulfil the screen in a way that it is almost impossible not to like! But because it is so different, I can totally see why people might not 'get it' because you need an imagination.The thing that stood out for me the most was the marvellous directing. It was so quirky and Tim Burton-esque, making the film look incredibly beautiful throughout. 'Amelie' is a visual treat! There is some incredible cinematography in there, so if you're a fan of a good looking film, you've found one! Films that look good, usually use style over substance but I can't say that with 'Amelie' the screenplay is ferociously original with a fast pace and some really well crafted characters. In fact every character we see actually has there own individual character! This is incredibly refreshing to see, after countless cardboard characters we've all gotten used too! 'Amelie' really is a beautiful film, it's quirky, original, and truly a one off! 'Amelie' manages to balance style with substance to make it a memorable experience. And even though at times I did get lost through the fast paced dialogue and directing, I 'got it' in the end and it was really worth seeing.",8,2,5,30 April 2011
The Purge," Consider me purged
","I may be a little bit biased in this review, because I am a horror nut who has a passion for the home invasion sub-genre. I find these films very tense, involving and thought-provoking because it could happen to anyone. Yes, it could happen to YOU! So when I saw the trailer for The Purge which seemingly burst out of nowhere I was incredibly excited! Firstly, the concept is highly original and very interesting. It's an idea I've never come across before. People have expressed concern about the annual purge just being a set-up for a home invasion movie, but the idea is extremely relevant throughout and serves to make the film even for thought-provoking. Whilst the idea, if it were really carried out, is totally bonkers and dumb, the film convincingly shows it as a good and helpful tool in helping the country that God really loves!People have also expressed concern about the film showing no other purge-related events outside the Sandlin family's attack. Well here I'm going to have to disappoint you, because apart from some CCTV footage for the opening credits to play over, you don't get to see very much else at all. However, I am actually very for this decision because it makes the film much more focused and makes the audience involved with the characters, so when the attack finally does arrive, it makes everything that much more intense. It's very hard to balance a film if its concentrated in several areas, and I think it would've been a bit messy. Sorry if you wanted to see more purge action though. Perhaps they will in the sequel.The lead up to the purge is done brilliantly. There's a great sense of anticipation and fear as we wait for the sirens to commence the purge. I also liked the emergency broadcast, which played out rather realistically. In fact, once the purge begins the film doesn't really stop being a tense and marvellously entertaining thrill ride. Some people say that the film isn't horror because they use guns. I'm sure if they didn't use guns people would be moaning about how it wasn't realistic because they didn't use guns! OK I admit guns were over-used because the horror hound inside me would've preferred some more decapitations with the axe and machete, but do not worry because they are still there! The film first and foremost is horror. You can't deny the creepiness of when the masked folk arrive, along with Rhys Wakefield's 'Polite Stranger'.Also, the masks themselves are brilliant! They have a creepy Strangers-esque vibe to them, and certainly set the horror tone. I've never seen or heard of Rhys Wakefield in anything else before, but the former Home and Away actor puts on an extraordinarily creepy performance, evoking Michael Pitt from Funny Games US. He has a seriously scary smirk that reminded me of Heath Ledger's legendary Joker. Rhys Wakefield could've made an even more memorable villain if he was in it more. Although, he completely stole all of the scenes he was in, I would've loved to have seen him play a bigger role with more screen time.The film isn't shy of throwing up moral dilemmas. It had my brain jogging about what I would in the situation, and we see a lot of interestingly dislikeable sides to Ethan Hawke's smug security expert, which isn't even strong enough to protect his own house! The final 30 minutes or so are incredibly entertaining. It's never short of a tense thrill and there is also one stand-out fight sequence that put a sadistic smile on my face (don't worry, I'm quite normal really). A nice surprising twist tops everything off and by the end of it you really do feel like you've been through quite an ordeal.The Purge offers a creepy, thrilling and innovative slice of home invasion. Whilst obviously not as amazing as Inside, or even Funny Games and the remake of Mother's Day, I think I enjoyed it more than The Strangers and to compare it to a more recent horror film, I liked it about as much (or maybe ever so slightly less) than Evil Dead. The Purge certainly doesn't deserve the knocks it has been getting from a lot of people. I do think it could've been longer as I couldn't get enough of the action-packed finale, which surely isn't a bad thing is it? I enjoyed it a lot and I think a lot of horror fans are going to enjoy it too. It's an under-valued film with a fantastically original concept, which deserves more views!",6,9,19,7 June 2013
The Matrix," Matrix? More Like Weetabix!
","I honestly do not understand why this 'film' is so adored and praised like it's the next 'Citizen Kane' (I personally hated 'Citizen Kane' but would watch it over this!) Yes it does have some fabulous action sequences but they come thinly in once in a blue moon with no plot to actively engage in.That's a good place to start actually. The plot. WHAT PLOT?! I think i must've gone down the rabbit hole whilst watching this because absolutely nothing made sense. Talk about style over substance! Right from the opening I didn't have a clue what was going on. So a man gets sucked down some gooey alien bladder and is told he's the next Jesus or something like that and that everything in the world we know is completely fake and is a computer programme called 'The Matrix' and this 'Neo' character is now in the real world that looks more like a rip-off of a 'Terminator' set! Can we get real here please? Then there are some bad guys who i don't really get why are bad, but that they just go around wearing big wavy coats and stupid sunglasses indoors. Is this meant to be cool? Stick me in jeans and a T-Shirt any day of the week.So we've covered the complete mess of a plot, I literally didn't know where anything was going next! Where are now? Who's he? Why is that happening? Are popular phrases I would use on the 'Audio Commentary' for this load of... What shall I pan next? I don't have to think too hard because there are so many faults it's hard to pick. Kenau Reeves was rubbish as the main character and was far too moody to be likable. Then we've got some black man who acts like a prat 24/7 making 'Neo' do stupid and pointless things like fight kung-fu and prat about in white rooms to add to some more confusion.The action and special effects are really good but they need a plot to engage in to find them entertaining. I didn't know why they were fighting each other or why a certain thing was happening at all! Besides, the action sequences were very few and underwhelming to say the least.Visually stunning? Not really, the cinematography on Coronation Street is more stunning and as were the special effects for the crazy tram crash. So maybe I'm being a bit harsh there but it's merely to outline the disgust I felt from this film, the ending left me thinking how anyone could like this 'Terminator' wannabee.It's unengaging, virtually unwatchable and with a plot more tangled than Hayley Croppers styled wig. Don't you tell how great 'The Matrix' is.",6,3,8,25 June 2011
Looper," Loopy great fun!
","I just had to buy Looper when I heard all the hype surrounding it. I thought I was in luck when a friend lent me his 'friend's' pirate copy, which is something I've never actually done before and will probably never do again in the future because the quality was what I like to call, 'floppy'. Bad sound, pixelated picture, I couldn't watch such a visual treat like Looper on that kind of quality! So I hunted Ebay and found a dangerously cheap copy, and I'm very glad that I did. Whilst Looper isn't the greatest sci-fi film ever made, like some people keep proclaiming, it certainly is a solid, entertaining and gripping adventure with a very original idea. Now, the first 45 minutes or so did lose me slightly in certain areas with its mind-bending premise of time-travel (which still doesn't entirely make sense), but if you just go with it then you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did.Now, I don't completely understand how killing your own future self would not effectively kill you, but like I said, just go with it. It's a clever idea and one I haven't seen the likes of. Of course the film is set in the future so we get all the futuristic clichés of hover-bikes and weird tall buildings (we'll have to wait until 2044 arrives, to see just how accurate everything is) but at its core, the world isn't much different to how it is now. We're introduced to our hero, a drug-addicted murderer that some how remains likable throughout. The first hour of Looper acts like a rollicking sci-fi actioner as we're introduced to the idea of loopers and get to see what happens when things get out of hand.We all know that Bruce Willis comes back as Joseph's future self and silly old Joe lets him go! What I really liked here was that a certain sort of human element was introduced, which proved that Looper has heart as well as brain (almost like a Christopher Nolan film). We see Joseph age up into Bruce and he falls in love with a Chinese woman young enough to be his daughter (but we'll look over that) and I won't spoil the rest of it, but it certainly helps us feel some emotion for Bruce's character as we know what he's been through. There's also a great scene where Joseph and Bruce talk in a diner (reminded me of Heat) and Joseph is quite keen to shoot him. It's suspenseful stuff!For me, the film hit its stride when Joseph meets Emily Blunt at a nice farmhouse and we hear of Bruce's heart-breaking master plan. The film completely changes pace from rollicking sci-fi action to a more gentle, yet no less thrilling, pace. Now, this will probably upset/anger sci-fi action fans, but it adds a lot of emotion to the film and a strong human element. These parts were gripping, touching and very clever. There were some brilliantly tense scenes as well as some rather wonderful special effects which I won't spoil for you. The finale was compelling and very exciting with a clever and almost inspiring ending.Looper isn't as good as Inception. In fact, it isn't even a patch on Inception's mind-blowing brilliance, but it is a fun and entertaining ride with a lot of heart and brain. Needless to say that I really enjoyed every minute of it and I'm not into the sci-fi genre. The action was also really well shot, with no annoying shake or constant cutaways which made it all the more intense. The directing was often very impressive. I especially liked the crabbing camera motion! In the end, Looper is really worth seeing and also has good replay value. Don't go expecting Inception though!",8,1,4,28 March 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Mind-blowing
","I'd like to say that first of all I'd advise you not read any reviews or watch any trailers for this film. I wouldn't even read this one if you haven't seen it yet because although I will really try not to give anything away, I can't be sure because I haven't yet looked into the future. The fact is 'The Cabin In The Woods' is like 'The Ordeal' in the sense that with 'The Ordeal' or you need to know before watching it is that a singer's car breaks down in the woods. Similary with this film all you need to know is that 5 young adults stay at a cabin in the woods. Luckily when I went in I didn't know too much and so I didn't know what to expect at all, but I certainly didn't expect to see what I did see. Just leave all your logic at the cinema's car park (or DVD case if you're reading this in the future) and prepare to have your mind blown.I don't mean to hype this up or anything but it is as good as everyone does say and it took me some time after the film had finished to adjust to that. I wasn't expecting 'The Cabin In The Woods' to be so insane or 'out there' that I was shocked, and I didn't know if it was pleasantly. When the film did finish I couldn't make my mind up if what I just saw was completely brilliant or just cr*p, or if I loved it or hated it (to be fair I was leaning over to the 'love' side just because I had a ball watching it). But, once I had time to gather my thoughts, because 'The Cabin In The Woods' does surprisingly give you a lot to take in, I realised that I had just seen a masterpiece. It's revolutionary and is probably the king of all slashers because it manages to explain them so well, with it being also marvellously entertaining. It manages to dissect the slasher sub genre and almost the whole horror genre itself in a even braver way than 'Scream' did! 'The Cabin In The Wood' has been described as this generations 'Scream' and I think I have to agree, I just hope we don't get any 'Cabin' copy-cats which 'Scream' created! The film opens up in a unusual way and manages to set the vibe you're about to sit yourself in for. We get some stereotypical horror-movie titles with blood dripping down and pictures of old sacrifices and then it's immediately juxtaposed with two technicians having an every-day chat in an office-type building, which almost acts as a oxymoron for what you were expecting. Then the titles flash up on the screen, which I loved because it was unexpected and also not really fitting, which is really what describes the film. And then the first 20 minutes or so show us the stereotypical slasher film, it's amazingly clichéd, but it's clichéd for a reason. We've got our stereotypical five friends, one couple and one 'potential' couple and then we've got the drug-taking nut-case who is actually quite likable, unlike most druggies in horror films who are so annoying that you can't wait to see them die! And then they go off to the cabin, your stereotypical replica of 'The Evil Dead' after stopping at a 'Wrong Turn' slash 'The Hills Have Eyes' styled petrol station that's run by a crazy hill-billy. It's all marvellously done and is basically everyone's schema of a slasher film.But once the basement opens it becomes far from your stereotypical slasher film. It becomes a non-stop exciting fight for survival and that's all I'll say about it. The bottom line is that it's really fun and sometimes quite scary. The final 25 minutes or so actually end up as being one of the craziest sequences since the big mum ending in Peter Jackson's 'Braindead'. It's bloody, chaotic and also serves a purpose. 'The Cabin In The Woods' is an extremely intelligent horror film as well as being 'Breathlessly entertaining' as a quote on the poster promises. It's wonderfully wittedly written by Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard who's work I've been impressed with on 'Cloverfield' and 'Let Me In'. 'The Cabin In The Woods' really does show their true potential though, by presenting something so simple and stupid and then turning it into something incredibly complex, intelligent and high-concept. It's sort of like a fun/funny version of 'Martyrs' in that when you think it's going one way it goes in a completely different direction and throws you off. It's fabulous. Also, all the characters are actually likable, which I always say is the body of a good slasher film.I really admire films that are brave and 'The Cabin In The Woods' could've turned into a confused mess. But luckily by not taking itself seriously (at all!) and structuring itself carefully, it turns itself into an incredibly memorable horror comedy. It presents a disturbing view of reality and the slasher genre, but what's even more disturbing is that something this spectacular was sitting on a shelf for three years gathering up dust! And the reason behind that is even more disturbing! They were thinking about converting it into 3D. That would be a tragedy and would perhaps suck out its substance, by putting its style first.It absolutely deserves a perfect 10 but, people who have never seen a slasher film before are likely to disagree. I saw this film almost one week ago and it still hasn't been out of my head (which isn't the best thing when your A-level exams are 3 weeks away) which you can't say for many films. Also it really is so unique that you couldn't give it any less. Oh, and I'll give you one million pounds if you saw the ending coming a mile off. I can't wait to see it again.",10,4,13,21 April 2012
Mad Max: Fury Road," It's nice to see that George Miller has mellowed in his old age
","Slow, uneventful, boring, and subtle. These are some of the words you'd never hear from any sane person describing Mad Max 4. Before I dig deeper I should probably let you know that I'm a twenty year-old man who only recently watched the original Mad Max trilogy, so I don't have any nostalgia attached to them. The first Mad Max film is genuinely considered mediocre by most people apart from proud Aussies, and my opinion was pretty much the same. It didn't leave a particularly lasting impression.The Road Warrior, however, is generally considered as one of the greatest action movies of all time. I was expecting a full-on action fest (much like Fury Road) but unfortunately what I got was a ponderous seventy minutes involving Max titting about with a colony of people protecting fuel before ending with a spectacular car chase. I was quite disappointed and can name several older action films that are far better than The Road Warrior (Terminator 2 and Hard Boiled to name two). Beyond Thunderdome is generally considered as the worst of the lot but to my pleasant surprise I actually enjoyed this the most out of the trilogy! It might have something to do with me being a massive Tina Turner fan, but I thought there was more action and better characters than the other two films.After being largely underwhelmed by the Mad Max trilogy, I had my expectations for Fury Road lowered. Pretty much every review I've read has been astonishingly glowing with many hailing it as one of the best action films of all time, but didn't they say that about The Road Warrior? Fury Road is directed by the same George Miller, a man now in his seventies who hasn't directed an action film since Beyond Thunderdome and whose recent credits include Happy Feet and Babe: Pig in the City, Mad Max 4 is bound to be pretty weak, right? Wrong.Believe the hype. Mad Max: Fury Road is an incredible feat. I have no idea how George Miller managed to pull out something so utterly spectacular out of his bag. Fury Road is the best action film I've seen since The Raid and has some of the best stunt work since The Dark Knight Rises. In my opinion it leaves the original Mad Max trilogy lying face down in the dust. Fury Road is the great big throbbing war machine whilst the original trilogy is some old rusty bicycle. The first ten minutes of Fury Road is far better than anything from Mad Max 1-3 and the entire two hour film definitely contains far more action than the first three films put together. Fury Road is amazing.It opens with an epic monologue from our new Max, Tom Hardy. Mel Gibson never did anything for me as Max. In fact, the character of Max never did much for me. I much prefer Tom Hardy as Max. His accent may be as muddled as Stu's tan in Mrs. Doubtfire but I think he has much more of a presence than Mel Gibson ever did. His famous interceptor is destroyed within the first five minutes which is obviously symbolic. Just like James Bond getting shot in the opening of Skyfall and a TV exploding in the opening of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, the interceptor getting totalled represents a new era of Mad Max. George Miller has completely cut the ties from the original films and quite rightly so! We get thrown into a huge world and feel fully immersed. The imagery is huge and epic. It feels like something from Lord of the Rings with some powerful masked weirdo sitting on a giant cliff and spilling gallons of water to his loyal pale-painted followers. The villain in Fury Road is basically Aunty Entity on acid and curiously similar to Tom Hardy's very own Bane. He's a brilliantly memorable villain who has his very own breast milk farm and an army of seriously sexy wives.It occurred to me about three quarters of a way through the film that I actually cared about the characters on the screen, which I've never felt before during a Mad Max film (apart from Tina of course). The action still comes first, but there's still some character development to keep you interested in the thin plot. Some have complained that Charlize Theron's Furiosa character takes over from Max but that didn't bother me at all. I love strong female characters and Furiosa is definitely that! I cared about the clan of oddballs and their goal. Enough, anyway, to make me care about who is in the action.Talking of action. Fury Road's action sequences are every bit as amazing as you've heard. It's a total intense onslaught of revving action from start to finish. Within the first thirty minutes, we're plunged into a fiery sandstorm with a furious army of vehicles in hot pursuit. I sat there completely mesmerised by what I was watching. There's a jarring moment shortly afterwards where Max slowly awakes from a pile of sand and the slowness of the scene is so bloody jarring! Ninety minutes of Fury Road is just pure full-throttle action. It's amazingly executed with so little CGI and jaw-dropping stunt work. The final chase sequence is completely exhausting.Fury Road is eye popping. I felt like Toe Cutter before he collides into a lorry in Mad Max 1 for most of it. Let's just hope that the sequel will be like The Raid 2. It could easily get better by putting as much focus on character development and plot as well as the action. The Raid 2 did exactly that and produced one of the best films of the twenty first century. As it stands though, Fury Road is a gigantic, towering achievement. You can almost feel the testosterone sweating off the screen. The Fast and Furious franchise can well and truly sod off.",9,3,9,21 June 2015
