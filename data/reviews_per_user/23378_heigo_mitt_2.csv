The Monuments Men," The most undermined movie of the year - Never trust a Critic with a bag of cynicism
","This is a movie about preserving art at the end of the second world war when the nihilism and anarchy was on its peek by systematically destroying the most precious treasures of mankind. This is definitely not a typical action comedy storyline and sounds more like the premise for an documentary. This is an 'Clooney Style' flick, nevertheless it is definitely worth to watch and be entertained even more than typical action comedy. This is exactly for viewers who don't like documentaries, so not like myself, but still I enjoyed it a lot. Movie should have gone deeper to the characters and specify more the historical side and the treasures of art that were saved. On the other hand it probably would have turned out more like an documentary which weren't the intention with this cast and production. Why there aren't more of these type of films? Motion picture is an art form itself, so it would be logical that this would be a sacred story for every piece of art in the world. Those who live out of the movie business (like critics) shouldn't get much value for their thoughts. Most of the reviews are envious and cynical with unfair amount of criticism.",9,0,0,9 August 2014
The Monuments Men," The most undermined movie of all time. Never trust a Critic
","Making an entertaining movie about preserving art in the end of the war when the nihilism and anarchy was on its peek by destroying the most precious treasures of mankind. Sounds more like the premise for an documentary, but this turned out to be a rather entertaining flick. This is specially made for people who don't like documentaries, so not for me, but I still liked it a lot.Only downside that it should have gone more inside to the characters and specify even more those actual treasures of art that were saved from Hitler and Stalin. On the other hand then it probably would have turned out more like an documentary which isn't the case with this cast. Why there isn't more of these kind of films? Motion picture is an art form itself, but when even people who live out of movies (critics) don't value it how can you trust their opinions and in this case their reviews? Are their views political or are they just a product of our ignorant time?",9,0,0,9 August 2014
