Casablanca," Truly a Timeless Classic
","Casablanca is a movie that most people hear about. A lot of Cartoons give a nod to it in some way, it has been parodied multiple times, and it has influenced numerous other films. Casablanca is a movie I had thought was always over-hyped and placed on a pedestal for no reason other than it being a 'classic'. After watching the film however I understand the hype. It is a timeless movie filled with romance, drama, and the occasional witty line. Bogart and Bergman have an electric chemistry and just look well together overall. Although they do not end up together in the end, Ilsa (Bergman) and Rick (Bogart) share a romance on screen that truly shows that 'if you love something set it free.' Rick risks it all to help the woman he once loved, and still probably does love. Aside from the romantic relationships, the friendship that binds Rick and Captain Louis Renault (Rains) appears genuine. They are two men who become entwined with due to unfortunate circumstances and what becomes of them after the film is something that I personally would like to know about.",10,1,3,11 March 2015
