Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not up to par
","An over-all great movie that was over-hyped to the point of disgust,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, was just a sequel. In 1977 a movie came out that revolutionized not only the sci-fi genre of movies but the entire film industry. It contained unforeseen special effects, an unknown, new writer, political allusions, mythical outlines, intense religious themes, and all came back to the simplistic nature of the family. Now don't get me wrong, this movie was great. It was one of the best movies I've seen. But I believe that another movie deserves much, much more praise than The Phantom Menace and that movie is The Matrix. IT had revolutionary special effects, IT had an original plot, if that movie was hyped up HALF as much as The Phantom Menace It would have gathered mile lines also. But back to the movie at hand. The Phantom Menace was more of a sequel than a film of epic proportions.",Null,0,1,10 June 1999
