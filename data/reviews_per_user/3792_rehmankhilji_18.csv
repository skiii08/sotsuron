Ford v Ferrari," Beautiful
","Everything is beautiful about this movie, the cast, the direction, the story line (though might be a little twisted from reality) in short everything.
Christian Bale, with the weight loss and british accent, wonderful acting. Matt Damon being at his best.
Must watch, with friends, family or even alone. It does not matter.",8,1,2,1 February 2020
It," Not that scary
","Like many other users wrote, the scary element is a bit less in this one. Though u might have a moment or two but that's pretty much about it. Another element is over use of strong language by the young cast, therefore, a little warning.
With so much advance tech many scenes could have been made better. 
But then again it was my childhood movie being remade, all that came back was that era being scared with a smile.
A good weekend watch.",6,0,0,24 December 2017
The Maze Runner," Not impressive
","I am not a book reading person, so for its the movie that matters. What ever was in the book and what ever was adapted thus seem irrelevant. There has not been a single time i have come across some stating that the movie was better then the book. So book readers for you the movie will never be better. Better not watch it or else you will be up for a one big disappointed. From a movie point of view it is once again on those lines that world is destroyed and some people have survived and now they are living up for some goal. But what goal this movie had is something remained unanswered. Its on the same lines of Hunger Games and Divergent but unlike them its not focusing a women be the center, this time its a guy who saves the day. Young kids are put through a test for achieving some unknown results. But what i failed to understand all of them were of the same age except for one and they even killed him in the end. The second thing i failed why and how they made Robo Cop monsters, like what was the purpose. Movie left me with many questions. Not a 7 as IMDb but for one time watch if you don't have anything better to see. So its a 5 for me.",5,0,1,13 December 2014
The Babadook," Horrible
","Another movie which i made to watch by high ratings at IMDb. Guess for this one people were made to rate high. For a start it wasn't scary at all. Like you watch a horror movie not for a laugh but some real shivers, however this movie is not giving one at any level. Further, its a poor budget movie. Horrible lines, boring, just two three characters in the entire movie and with a horrible ending. This movie is keeping the audience confuse as to what happening is real or just in the mind of characters. If you are a horror movie fan and watch the same for some real thrills then this is the one for you dust bin and not something to watch. Nonetheless its a high rates movie at IMDb for the reasons not know. Complete waste of money time and a weekend.",3,1,6,8 February 2015
Us," Illogical
","I am again surprise at high ratings over IMDB, this movie was not only stupid but senseless, confusing, storyless and without a rhyme.
There is no base of this movie, there is no reason attached to it. Movies are suppose to be based on hypothetical averments but this movie was based on something too stupid and complete senseless.
It a complete waste to watch, there is nothing horror or any element of thriller involved. Dont waste time",1,1,2,19 June 2019
The Irishman," Watch it for the CAST
","Bada Bing Bada Bing...
If you understand these words, it very much your type of the movie. & Its cast is humongously beautiful. Like having Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in one frame that like indescribable.
Nevertheless, as you watch on the movie the cast gets better and better. Story line, acting, dialogues everything is beautiful. Yes i found the story a little off beat. It is surely not kind of God Father movie that you will watch a million times but since its there watch it for the cast and the cast only with low expectations.",6,5,9,1 December 2019
Ready Player One," Different as to WOW DIFFERENT
","Steven Spielberg does it again, he really knows how to put up a complete entertainment for all ages. Especially if you have lived through the life of 80's and 90's, you are in for a treat.
Dont waste your time reading the reviews, just watch it.",8,0,1,19 June 2018
The Lost City of Z," Utterly Boring
","On basis of the title was looking for an adventurous movie. But there is hardly anything of that sort present. Don't get me wrong, there is an adventure in the movie for sure, but it has been shown very little. It is a story about a man's adventure for finding a lost city in Amazon which he could not never complete. In the movie much has been filmed as to how he proceeded but not shown a great detail about the adventure. Utterly boring and not a single element of entertainment, effects, scene or anything in it.",1,4,12,9 July 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once upon a time
","Once upon a time there was an idiot who wrote a movie called 'Once Upon a time in Hollywood'. But the story dont end here, he even went on directing it.
To add further he cast best actors in the business, gave them the horrible roles of the career and those idiots went on playing it.
To show his disturbed and unbalanced mind he ends the movie with meaningless, disgusted, ruthless and inhuman scene you would ever witness.
Moral of the story, save your soul and dont watch it.",1,5,8,27 December 2019
Aladdin," Beautifully perfect
","What a movie, what a ride down the memory lane, what a treat, Will Smith simply wow.
Each and every word reminded of the childhood classic, beautiful presented, beautifully played and Will Smith, is simply amazing, he has brought a different flavour to the Genie, without damaging the original. He just paced it up. What a fine actor, what a fine person, he was simply amazing from the word start till the end. Good job sir.
Thank you for a lovely cinematic experience which i enjoyed fully with my family.
Must watch for everyone, everyone must must watch.
Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud, outstanding in the roles, completely justify their selection.
Guy Ritchie deserves all the applause for this magnificent direction.",8,1,3,24 June 2019
1917," Superb Cinema
","This one single shot movie, what an amazing cinematic experience. This movie does not even let you blink your eye, amazing concept, superably made, beautifully laid and a fantastic experience.
Sam Mendes, should have won the awards for this, including oscar, cause on this and joker are movies with some sense.
Nevertheless, a must watch, any time and every time.",8,2,2,24 March 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Over Rated
","Dear IMDb, 7.5 makes the movie to fall in the category of all time best. Such a movie which one can watch unlimited number of times. Don't think you can watch this flick more then one. CGI and technology has given a new life to movies, especially to Fairy Tales. But remaking one tale over and over again makes the story boring. Maleficent was the one which was not only different but too damn good. This on the other hand, well not that good honestly. Ema Watson has done a good job but the rest were just pushing themselves too hard. Dan Stevens should have opted for Gatson and Luke Evans should have played the beast. Lets say this is an Era when a beautiful guy cant be the hero of the day it requires more manly look. Josh Gad, such a stupid role his played. I know he would curse for doing it for the rest of his life. In short awsomely boring and with too much unnecessary music and the end is too cheesy.",4,1,4,4 June 2017
Joker," A master piece
","Monsters are not born, they are created and this is what this movie has laid down. 20 Years ago if someone said Joker or any other character can be nominated for Oscar, that would be a joke. But Joaquin Phoenix has placed this role in one of the most beautiful character ever played list. He made other famous actors performing this role right in the trash. And all and every awards should be given to Joaquin Phoenix for his master piece.
Though would love to see an end seen of Batman in it, but guess after this performance batman would have looked horrible.
A must watch, should not be left regardless you are DC follower or not.",8,4,9,19 December 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Must must watch
","Giving it a nine should define how good it is. Want to write a lot about the movie but then might be subjected to spoiler, so writing one without it. An excellent treat to watch, a movie with a beautiful theme and story. Beautifully made with excellent directions. Hats off to T.C. While i started the movie i was like whats with Tom Cruise and these Sci- Fi Alien based movies..... but this is so much better the previous one. During the movie when you will say 'O i know what will happen next' something else happens and takes you completely by surprise. Its a must must watch for all ages... and i simply love its ending. Watch it and a must for your DVD/BluRay collection.",9,1,4,23 September 2014
Lucy," Horrible
","Its one of the those movies which i watched mainly for two reasons, its cast and IMDb ratings. Both have yet again deceived me and deceived big time. If you have seen Bradley Cooper's 'Limitless' this movie is based on the same lines. The difference is Limitless was easier to be expected my a normal brain. As for LUCY one has to be a complete Moran and idiot to believe in such presentation. First of all Darwin theory is nonsense, no matter how much Holly Wood tries to justify it, its completely, utterly nonsense. Further, Limitless was a movie about a guy who take some unknown pill and it enhances his mental capabilities, makes him a smart guy, makes him remember everything and give access to every thought, every memory and everything that he ever experience. On the other LUCY also takes some same kind of drug, well not the same and not the same way but at least a drug. And she becomes a god. Yes a god. She can make people fly, make people do stupid things, intercept phone calls, making the world as matrix, move in her mind to past, even the time of dinosaurs and a stupid monkey drinking water....!! she can do anything. Not to forget the most irritating part.... she transforms herself into a computer, make a usb out of her... (which part of body thats a mystery) and they she is vanished in air...!! o Sorry she becomes Air...!! as if she is some god...!! A stupid movie, i watched for the cast if you love the cast may see it, other wise you ain't missing anything.",3,6,15,8 December 2014
Midway," Average
","Cast is good, story is about one of the greatest battles over the pacific and which surely change the course of World War. The only annoying factor for me and perhaps the only reason for not liking it was the acting of Ed Skrein, he just did not fit for the role. I am not sure whether Dick Best was similar in real life or not, but he surely have executed the role horribly.
Further the start scene of Pearl Harbour was horrible. Though the movie was not on it but still could be better.
Not one the best war movies just an average one.",5,3,7,8 February 2020
Life," Good Cast Bad Use (Little spoilers you can live with)
","There a certain shift with Hollywood approach towards aliens. First aliens use to be friendly. Now each and every movie alien are bad enemies regardless of their form. And as always the alien life form is intelligent (even without a brain or was there one, well they never told so skip that) powerful but in the end a human will find some way BUT before you think all is good there is that one scene placed mostly in case of sequel. So this movie is somewhat like the previous version of space venture / AKA there has to be a life on Mars. But i missed on this movie, wasn't aware of its release and was surprised to see the cast. But disappointed Ryan Reynolds: You really need to get over with Dead Pool character. All the cursing and swearing might look in that movie but not everywhere. And i think u missed out on the script. There was no way you were being brought back to life in this movie. You were a side kick in this movie. Even Hiroyuki Sanada had more scenes and lines then u had in the movie. And yes one more thing. I believe Hollywood is being forced on gender rights too much lately. Why?.... because once again the command of the ship is a LADY... Russain this time but no hottie Russian.... that ugly type. If u don't see it you wont be missing anything.",4,0,3,10 June 2017
Da 5 Bloods," Terrible Presentation
","The cast i good, the story is interesting but it is simply a very bad directed movie. You will know this from the very start of the movie. Cast playing their past and present looking the same, except for Chadwick Boseman is simply ridiculous. Him being the major star is not even named in the movie info here on IMDB.
You can live without watching it. Netflix, bad bad production.",3,4,7,18 June 2020
