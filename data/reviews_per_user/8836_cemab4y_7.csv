Casablanca," My all time favorite
","SPOILER ALERT! This film is over a half-century old. If you have not yet seen it, do not read the following review.I cherish this film. There are films I love, but I cherish Casablanca. The premise of the film is about doing the right thing. Fighting the Nazis, giving up your one true love, making sacrifices, etc. How can a person not identify with such a film? The dialogue is priceless, many of the phrases and lines have made it into our common speech. There was even a movie made called 'The Usual Suspects'. How many films have had a whole film made, from a line in the film? And my all-time favorite line, is when Captain Renault tells Rick to be kind to women 'Someday, they may be scarce'! I must say I cringed when I learned that there was a 'colorized' version of this film released in Australia. This film must be seen in monochrome. The issues, love/jealousy, and freedom/tyranny are black-and-white issues.The 'battle of the anthems' scene, is one of the most powerful scenes ever committed to film. The band strikes up 'La Marsellaise', and the people sing it with fervor. Many of the actors, had recently escaped from Europe, and they cried real tears. I always weep profusely, when I see this part of the film.One of my pastimes is hookah smoking. This film is one of the very few films ever made, which show a smoldering hookah. Every time I smoke a hookah, I channel 'Casablanca'.I am delighted that the AFI voted 'Casablanca', as the #2 all-time greatest film of the past 100 years. It deserves the honor.",Null,1,2,15 May 2010
Star Trek," Thumbs up!!!!
","A splendid film. And Great fun. I went hysterical at the references to the classic TV series. What a delight to see Kirk, Spck, Bones, Uhura, and all the gang again. I am glad that J.J. Abrams was able to get the the essence of the original show, and give us a real taste.I am thoroughly delighted to hear of the plans to shoot 2 (?) sequels. No matter, Star Trek will never die, the 5 TV series will be playing on TV until eternity.I have urged all my friends to see this film, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.The humanity and humor of the film, came through with excellence. I am delighted with the fine ensemble cast and the obvious respect that the actors had for the characters. I am looking forward to seeing more of Dr. McCoy.",10,3,11,10 May 2009
The Dirty Dozen," One swell picture!
","I saw this film in 1967, at the age of 13. I had been watching 'Combat' on TV, and I knew the 'Krauts' were evil, and the 'G.I. Joe's' were always good and heroic. What a surprise to find out that Americans could be evil as well. I will always enjoy Telly Savalas, as Pvt. A.J. Maggot. He has the most evil laugh, and he is a Bible-reading, avenging angel of the Lord. What an over-the-top performance. When he is walking around the ch√¢teau, saying 'Come out you sinners, come out come out, wherever you are!' I always cheer. Go get 'em A.J. !! The cast is superb, the film was Donald Sutherland's big break, he was picked to play the 'General', and he ripped into the part, like a pit bull, the perfect touch of comic genius. Even Trini Lopez, was terrific, as a felon, whose only problem, is that the guards won't let him have any strings for his guitar. He gets the strings, and gets to sing 'The Bramble Bush'.John Cassavetes (oscar-nominated) is perfectly slimy, as the 'little bastard', Victor Franko. Always bitching about the floor,or the hot water, just superb.The terrific cast includes Robert Webber, as a brightly polished adjutant officer, the perfect counter-point to the undisciplined Major Reisman (Lee Marvin). Robert Ryan, plays a west-pointer, who has the perfect combination of rage and humor.The technical side of the film is excellent. Superb camera work and cinematography, smooth editing, great close-up work on Telly Savalas. Frank DeVol's score is riveting: drumbeats, and precise military rhythms. We even get to hear Sousa's 'National Emblem' march. Robert Aldrich's precise direction, keeps a fine pace, during the first half of the film, mixing some comedy with the efforts of the scum-bags to become soldiers again. The climax builds, and then the successful conclusions.Ex-football player, Jim Brown, is superb. The Army was segregated in 1944, and Telly Savalas asks 'Do we have to eat with n*****s?' and then a riot ensues. We keep waiting for Jim Brown to run. When is he going to run? Finally, he gets to run, blowing up the Krauts. Sort of a reprise to Jesse Owens, showing up the Nazis at the Berlin Olympics.I never miss a chance to see this film, every time it is run on TV.",9,1,3,18 March 2010
Kelly's Heroes," Excellent
","This film is the pre-eminent 'heist/caper' film of all time. The guys go in for a romp, the cast is excellent. Don Rickles playing 'Crapgame', is a master-stroke of casting. My favorite scene is Carroll O'Connor, listening to the radio. The discussion goes: 'I'm not holding back for five hours, I'm not holding back for five minutes! I pulling' out, and pushing forward!' I split my sides.The film takes pokes at the ridiculousness of the rules of war. Captain Maitland, ripping off a yacht, tells the men, that 'The penalty for looting is death!' The double standard is pounded home.Donald Sutherland's character is perfectly realized. His continued references to 'negative waves', is hilarious. He even has the calm, to 'chill out', eat cheese, drink wine, and catch 'rays', during the battle. How anti-war! I watch this film again and again.",10,1,3,15 March 2010
Dark Shadows," A delicious treat for us boomers
","This film was a delicious treat for me. I cherished the original show, running home after school each day to catch the show. It was a real 'retro' feast, with hippies, and a VW microbus, and even Alice Cooper.I got some terrific 'retros' from the plastic ball 8-track player, and the shag carpeting, and the Lava Lamp, how delightful. The film had some really goofy comedy, and some excellent special effects, which were not even dreamed of in 1969.I even enjoyed the Carpenters! A 'cherry on top', of a delicious film.Thank You Tim Burton, and Johnny Depp, and all the cast and crew for your excellent work.",Null,2,4,9 June 2012
Blow," An interesting film
","I saw this film yesterday. I did not feel sorry for the principal character. The character, played by Johnny Depp (a good performance, understated). I have no pity for a dope-dealing scumbag. Cocaine is pure evil, and it wrecks lives. Any scumbag who brings this poison into our country is a traitor. He deserves anything that he gets.I was only sorry, that the dope-head did not get his brains blown out by one of his dope-dealing pals.I am glad that he is in prison, and I hope he rots there.This film shows the banality of our drug laws. We will not legalize drugs, and we will not enact stiff penalties on transporting/selling. The result is a society floating on coke.",5,1,3,13 March 2009
Valkyrie," Excellence
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. But I must say, that I kept comparing the film to the 1989 made-for-TV film, with the late Brad Davis. The plot is minimal, and everyone knows how it will end. The conspirators failed, and Hitler survived the bomb.But there will never be enough credit given to the brave men and women who stood up to Hitler. And there needs to be more examination of the fact that the Allied governments in WW2, all recognized 'governments-in-exile' of the occupied nations, but no Allied government recognized a 'government-in-exile' for Germany.The performance of Tom Cruise, is not one of his best, but the character of a decent man, comes through.",9,2,5,25 February 2009
