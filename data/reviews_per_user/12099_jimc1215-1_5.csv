Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not what I expected
","This movie was 90 minutes of Sasha Cohen being crude and offensive and coming up with all sorts of humorous sexual terms. Normally, I am entertained by this kind of humor and, yes, some of it was very funny,especially early in the movie. As the movie wound down disappointingly, I failed to see the humorous slant on American culture that I expected. Anyone who did must have one fine imagination. Please explain what the hotel room scene was satirizing. Having a limited knowledge of the movie before watching it, I was never sure what scenes were staged and what scenes were real people unaware of what was happening. In the end, I am not sure that it mattered. Though I got some good laughs, for the first time I can ever recall, I felt a little ashamed afterward for having sat through something so stupid as Borat. Check the IMDb voting demographics and you will see that it is the younger crowd that has driven its rating up.",3,5,11,18 December 2006
Friday Night Lights," Why the changes?
","As one who thoroughly enjoyed Bissinger's book, I found myself shaking my head during the movie over the deviations from the book. There are many of them and some reviewers have already done an excellent job of pointing them out, so I feel no need to repeat them. This is not a movie altering fiction, this is a movie changing facts and events that really did happen. None of my three movie companions had read the book and they all enjoyed the movie more than I, who wondered how these changes were making the story better. In case anyone is confused, the author was following the team during this season, he did not simply choose afterword to write about that season. Bissinger wrote a great book, but was extremely fortunate that the season he chose to follow the team turned out to be one full of interesting twists. I hope everyone enjoys the movie, and if you did, I strongly encourage you to read the book!",5,8,16,16 October 2004
Radio," You'll laugh and cry
","A movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family and most everyone will be touched by this story.  The audience certainly applauded at the end.  In fact, there were several instances where applause broke out, usually when the 'bad guys' got their just due.  I went to a preview showing of this movie and knew nothing about it in advance.  When I learned it was based on a true story, I was curious about how many and how big of liberties were taken from the actual truth.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. was lovable as 'Radio', but I compared his performance to that of Dustin Hoffman in 'Rain Man'.  Was it brilliant acting or simply getting in a mode and staying there for a whole movie?  Still, I felt good when the movie ended and my wife loved it!",7,0,0,19 October 2003
The Exorcist," More than a scary movie
","This story dealing with demonic possession is much more than a 'scary' movie.  I was in high school when this movie first came out and recall the way it affected some people.  A friend was so spooked he spent a night in a psychiatric ward.  My dad didn't want me to see it because my sister wouldn't sleep with her bedroom door shut after seeing the movie.  Me, I could handle it, but still was forced to wonder, could this happen to me? What an intense movie, I still get chills whenever I see this movie on TV.",9,0,2,21 August 2002
Born on the Fourth of July," Feel the emotion
","Wow, what an intense movie, the best I have seen on Vietnam or any other war, for that matter.  Every time I watch this movie I am thankful that I was a little too young to be involved in Vietnam.  Extremely well done, you can feel the emotion throughout the movie...young Ron preparing to go to war, the consequences of his injuries and the anguish and turmoil when he returns home.  During the parades scenes, I was intrigued by the irony of the of the veterans cringing each time they heard the crack of fireworks that was saluting them.  I agree that this is must-see for anyone considering the military.",9,0,2,9 August 2003
