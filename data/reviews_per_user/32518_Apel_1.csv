The Ring," Oh my god there's a fly on my screen...
","I just saw the movie.  I don't know where all these negative comments are coming from... probably from people who have only seen 'Ringu' ...  but I can tell you right now, it's my new favorite movie.  Very suspenseful... very unpredictable.  Good pacing, good story, great effects, great acting... ;(  but scary very scary. shhh.. i don't want to play it up too much... just watch it",10,0,0,19 October 2002
