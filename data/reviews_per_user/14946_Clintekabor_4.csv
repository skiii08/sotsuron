Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," History remembers the battle, but forgets the blood.
","You hear a title of this film and think 'meh' this could be absolutely horrendous and just an over the top corny comedy.However take away the incredibly noticeable CGI and just enjoy the film for what is. The sixteenth president of the United States of America as a ruthless vampire slayer during the American civil war.In fact there were only two scenes that were very over the top otherwise the character development and story itself hold up quite well.The story was fun and exciting. There weren't any dull moments as it was full of action and great slow motion cinematography, meaning awesome vampire deaths similar to that of the movie 300.Why this won't win any awards do give it a go if you want something enjoyable. It was much better than I originally anticipated.7/10",7,0,0,16 May 2020
John Wick," I once saw him kill three men in a bar with a pencil
","If your into over the top martial arts, Incredible athleticism, unbelievable shootouts and jam packed action then this film is for you.The story is about a man called John Wick (Keanu Reeves) who's wife has just passed away. He receives a parting gift from his wife, a small puppy named Daisy to help him deal with his mourning and grief.John has a run in with a Russian gang at a gas station who become aggravated and frustrated by not being able to persuade John to sell his car. The gangsters decide to break in to his house at night and assault John, steal his car and kill his puppy in the process.This sets up the vibe of the film. With John hellbent on revenge and retribution. He stops at nothing as he brutal hunts down all that were involved in burglary.A few thoughts about this movie. First I wish they used real Russian actors for their parts. It would have made this film much more believable and authentic. My wife who is Russian said she couldn't understand the accents and some of the dialogue. And I myself thought they were plain and humourless.The story itself is pretty weak. An ex hit man hunting down all those involved in stealing his car and killing his dog. Don't expect any twists and turns or unexpected moments the film just it is what it is.That being said I do hate to give this film such a low rating. John Wick and Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) was great in his role as the Mob boss and were both exhilarating to watch on screen. However the movie offers not much else in it's approach by trying make a new franchise that is both predictable and a little boring. Cinematography, visual effects, character development and story were all average at best. Amusing but a film that I will only be watching once.5/10",5,0,0,13 June 2020
The Shining," Redrum
","I watched this right after I'd seen Doctor Sleep and I must say this film is a timeless masterpiece and has aged beautifully through the years. You can see why this is a must watch for any lover of this type of genre.A highly recommended film that is topped off by an incredible preformance by Jack Nicholson (Jack) who completely made the film into what it is today. His chilling and iconic line 'Here's Johnny' still stands up as one of the best phrases in cinema. Shelley Duvall (Wendy) plays the supportive housewife and a wonderful mother to Danny with great casting support from Scatman CrothersThe location over the overlook hotel, hedge maze and the surrounding landscapes really bring the film to life. You feel a sense of awe in looking at the sheer size of the external hotel and internal structure. Some of the shots from the film were like watching a troubled family story. Such as the scene in where Jack is sitting on the bed with his back to the camera speaking with his son Danny. And you can see Jack's ominous facial expression in the reflection of the bedroom mirror and it is just so agonisingly well filmed you sit with anticipation and tension while on the edge of your seat.Overall a timeless classic of both horror and phycological thriller. It's in with one of the top ten films I have ever watched. And It would be something I would watch again and again.8.5/10",8,0,0,2 May 2020
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," I knew you wouldn't leave without me
","A spirited film which is equally uplifting and depressing. I think it has aged well through the years as it still shows us the mistakes and flawed systems in our past.Jack Nicholson in my opinion is one of the greatest actors of all time and shows us such raw emotion and phyiscal presence that you never know if he is playing a character on screen or just being himself. He shoulders the film (Like the Shining) but again not without the help of a superb support cast. Most of whom went on to become some of the best entertainers of the film industry in their own right such as Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif, Louise Fletcher, Scatman Crothers and Will Sampson.There are moments that make you feel good while you see the inmates starting to stand up for each other and strengthen their friendships. The companionship between McMurphy and Bromden is a major driver in the film which starts with the Basketball scene which was an emotional piece of cinema. It had all the inmates and orderlies bonding together and just having a good time and you start to the see the inmates get a new lease on happiness in their lives. All lead by the spontaneous and charismatic Randle McMurphy.While Randle has done some horrible things in the past to be admitted to the asylum including five assaults and the statutory rape on an underage girl. This film still makes his character fun and likeable and that is because he is a free spirit and not a person who is a danger to himself or others, but someone who just truly enjoys life's pleasures such as watching the world series, heavy drinking and sex.Louise Fletcher as Nurse ratched is brutally cold, manipulative and intelligent. While she does stand up for herself she also bullies, intimidates and uses the patients past and fears against them.The film is one that I highly recommend. It delves into the human mind and the will of freedom, the storytelling is just as good and is capped off in the ending with one of the most memorable scenes in movie history involving Will Sampson and Jack Nicholson.9/10",9,0,0,16 May 2020
