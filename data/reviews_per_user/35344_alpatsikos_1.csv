Ford v Ferrari," It's a joke
","This movie deserves no awards, no nominations, no high ratings. Waste of time. Probably they paid a loooooot in promotion. Comes to show you AGAIN to not trust critics. Embarrassing at least. I didn't know the story and during the entire movie I was wispering 'America First'... Hahahaha. After the end I ended up saying '... and Second and Third'. MAGA people will love it",1,13,32,22 January 2020
