The Ring," New Trousers Please
","I made the mistake of watching this film, after years of evasion, a couple of nights ago. You see, I'd heard this was genuinely scary (albeit not as scary as the original Japanese version). I'd delayed watching it because of the light in the eyes of anyone who told me about it was kind of....unnerving. Now, like several other posters on this site, I can't shut my eyes without playing through sequences in the film. Brrrrr, even writing about it conjures up a series of flashbacks. Having said all thatÂ….I still give this 10 out of 10. I love creepy films, but this is more than just creepy, it's insidious and nasty, you keep trying to swerve away from the creepy content and think about the atmospheric believable acting or the cinematography, but the shadow of flies, maggots, spinning chairs and grotesque facial distortions are lurking just out of the periphery of your minds eye. I think I'll give the original version a body swerve for a while longer.",10,0,1,1 February 2005
