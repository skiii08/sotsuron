It," Awful
","I thought the concept was good. I was so excited to watch it. Then the clown appears with what I can only describe as a mouse on helium voice, forehead longer than LAX airport strip and cheeks totally over done on blusher. Scary? Absolutely not. I thought give it some time it 'may' get better. The clown however becomes this supernatural, limb extending wormy thing. Modern Horror films have the potential to be amazing, with the technology and the ideas but this film just shows that if you want to be scared go back to 1975 horror film that uses plastic arm covered in ketchup and I guarantee you will be more scared.",1,6,10,13 April 2018
