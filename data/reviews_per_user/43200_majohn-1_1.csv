Lucky Number Slevin," There is a thing called 'too much'.
","I had no idea what this movie was about when my boyfriend dragged me along to see it in the theater yesterday. While I enjoyed the movie, I have to make a quick comment on how the movie was explained to death during the last 20 minutes or so. The explanation was not needed (except Lucy Liu's character and the cop and who he is and how he fits in). It would be highly sufficient, and the movie would actually be better if the audience were left to figure things out for themselves. A good movie is a movie who leaves some things unsaid.Other than that, go see it for good entertainment. Don't expect to be blown away in any way, because the plot is nothing new, but still worth mentioning as a decent movie.",7,0,6,13 May 2006
