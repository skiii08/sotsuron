Howl's Moving Castle," Has anyone seen a Japanese movie that actually DOES make sense?
","I'm pretty sure you have to be a) a child, b) completely brain dead, c) on many many hard drugs to make sense of probably all the Japanese movies I've ever seen.I give it a 3 for graphics.The only Japanese anime that I have even come close to liking so far is some episodes of Cowboy Bebop. Is there something wrong with me? What am I missing, people?Suggestions, please! Are there any Japanese movies out there that would appeal to my 'westernized' mind? I live in Hawaii, so I literally constantly find myself surrounded by Japanese people.",3,5,22,11 August 2006
