Catch Me If You Can," OSCAR FOR WALKEN
",Good film. Great cast. Someone should finally give Walken an Oscar for this performance!! DiCaprio blows away his alter-ego 'Gangs of New York' performance. This is a fun film that plays more like a character study than an action/suspense flick - and I the one am happier for it!,9,0,1,7 January 2003
