The Avengers," Can't Compare to The Dark Knight?... just did
","First off, I'd like to say that The Avengers was a GOOD movie. However, it was hyped up way too much, and after reading some review online, I think I know what my problem with it was. A lot of people are calling The Avengers the anti-Dark Knight. While I agree that these two movies are completely different, they are easily compared, and The Dark Knight wins by a mile. I was never really into comic books, but Batman has one of my favorites anyway. After seeing The Avengers, my only favorite was Iron Man, and only because of his own movie and, of course, Robert Downey Jr.. But getting to the point, the Avengers hardly had a plot. It was by far the coolest movie I have seen a while, but some of the things were just too annoying to get past. First: Transformers 3 much? Next: Many people say that Tom Hiddleston was fantastic as Loki. Maybe I wasn't watching the same movie, because he seemed to act without motivation and, indeed, a bit shallowly. Before being defeated, he reveals everything to the Black Widow, one who has clearly revealed her ploy already. For being a guy powerful enough to bring a massive army from another planet, he, and his army, were sure beaten pretty easily. Also, was anyone else perturbed by Hulk's sudden ability to control 'The Other Guy' (a stupid name to begin with) at the end? It's details like these, along with the lack of plot and themes that make me give this a 7/10. However, still a very enjoyable film, and I highly recommend seeing... as long as you don't claim it an 8.8, or #30 on IMDb.",6,4,12,11 May 2012
