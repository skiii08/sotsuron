Black Swan," Mediocre and immature
","Based on the commercials for Black Swan, I walked into the theater expecting to see a film about a career ballerina who is forced to access her repressed dark side in preparation for her role as the swan queen and cracks under the pressure. Instead, the film I saw was about a meek young woman who's possibly schizophrenic and certainly on the verge of a nervous breakdown from the opening reel. There's no real drama because Nina is already broken. All that's left is for the viewer is to watch her become increasingly unhinged.Black Swan has a lot of flaws: The conception of Nina (Natalie Portman) is a major problem. No woman this childish and meek would ever last in an elite dance company, so it's highly improbable that the company director (Vincent Cassel) would single her out for the prima ballerina role. We keep hearing about how Nina is technically perfect but clinical and restrained, but we never see any evidence of this fact because Portman is filmed mostly in tight facial close-ups during these scenes, probably to disguise the fact that her dancing isn't so spectacular.The film is utterly predictable in that Nina becomes increasingly unhinged to the point that we, the viewer, no longer know whether what we're watching is 'real' of one of her hallucinations, which greatly resemble horror movie clichés: she's stalked by her doppelganger, her reflection moves with a mind of its own, she imagines mutilating herself, etc. None of these images are particularly inspired and they spell out the theme of the story in the most obvious way.Black Swan was utterly derivative of other, better movies. I haven't seen The Red Shoes but so much of Nina's relationship with her mother was cribbed directly from The Piano Teacher that Michael Haneke could probably sue Aronofsky for plagiarism. Likewise, the whole angle of Nina's repressed sexuality leading to her breakdown was done better by Polanski in Repulsion, and that was almost 50 years ago. Black Swan is mostly a hodge-podge of better films.Finally, the film is every bit as Manichean as its title, with only two poles for its characters: perfectly pure and virginal white or the sensual black whore. Nina has a few drinks, masturbates and tells her oppressive mother off, and we're supposed to take this as some sort of exploration of her 'dark side.' Her rival ballerina Lily (Mila Kunis) literally has black wings tattooed on her back. Could you get any more obvious? I'd suggest that Black Swan works best as high camp and there were some unintended laughs in my theater, but the film is so self-serious and artistically restrained that it's not even gonzo enough to be funny. Mostly it's misery porn that wallows in Nina's suffering without giving the viewer a credible rationale for watching.Look, the film is well-directed, it looks great, the actors generally deliver good performances despite under-written roles. I've seen many worse films than Black Swan. But in this case the hype is so wildly overblown that I'm tempted to rate the movie even lower than it deserves. Truthfully, this is a 6 out of 10 picture and only slightly better than average.",5,569,911,11 January 2011
Dawn of the Dead," Not bad, but not nearly as good as the original
","The original DOTD is one of my Top 3 favorite horror films of alltime so I was bound to be disappointed in the remake but it was actually a little better than I expected. If you're looking for a slick, glossy and gory zombie film you'll be pleased. Actually, younger audiences and people who haven't seen the original DOTD might like the film more. The intro (first 10 minutes or so) and end credits sequences are both brilliant and make the film worth watching all by itself.I guess my big criticism is that the DOTD remake should've been a stand-alone film because it has almost NOTHING to do with the original, other than zombies the mall setting. Except the zombies in the first film were slow, lumbering and relentless. The zombies in this film are fast, rabid, and quite derivative of 20 Days Later. The mall setting in the first film was used to satirize consumer culture. The mall in this version of DOTD is just a setting - the characters in this film could have holed up anywhere, because the remake complete eliminates all of the subtext of the first film.Some good gore, a few scares and the most inspired intro and end credits I've seen in a horror film in a while, but whereas the original DOTD was funny and smart in addition to being horrifying, this version is slick, shallow and has nothing to say.",6,2,3,3 June 2009
Army of Darkness," A definite step down from the first two installments
","What happened to the horror elements? Although the first two Evil Dead films show some touches of pitch black humor and camp (much moreso in ED 2), the series to this point had gallons of gore and some legitimate moments of grotesque horror. In Army of Darkness, Raimi strips out the horror elements almost entirely, ups the slapstick humor and ends up with a film that feels like Jason and the Argonauts meets the Three Stooges.On the plus side, this is the film in the series that features the best of Ash's misogynist, cocky and moronic one-liners. Bruce Campbell is such a great screen presence that he carries the film all by himself for a good half hour. The set designs are decent in a crappy Terry Gilliam kind of way and Raimi's visual flare and bizarro camera angles are always welcome.The problem is the story and the change in tone. Around the midway point though the novelty of seeing Ash in the fantasy dark ages started to wear off and the humor in the film was a little too broad (i.e. juvenile) to sustain itself. I recently let my 9 y/o daughter watch Army of Darkness - she has NO tolerance for horror films and thought this movie was a riot. Army of Darkness isn't scary at all.If Army of Darkness is the first of the 'Evil Dead Trilogy' you've seen you'll probably like it a lot more than I did. I think my love of the first two films has a lot to do with my disappointment in this installment.",6,2,6,27 May 2009
The Cabin in the Woods," Somewhat disappointing
","I wanted so badly to love this movie but just ... didn't. I think part of the problem is that A Cabin in the Woods (ACITW) is seriously mismarketed as a horror film when really, it's never scary and I'm not sure it's even trying to be. I'm not going to recount the plot because either you know it or you don't, in which case I don't want to ruin it. I'll just talk about what worked and what didn't (for me).The concept was very clever and I really appreciated that the film was willing to go so far off the reservation. There is a scene of utter Lovecraftian mayhem at the end that almost made the entire film ... you WILL know it when you see it! The performances are uniformly strong and the film looks good and it's well-shot. I admired the film's ambition and attempt to deliver something we haven't seen before.That said ... I felt that ACITW was more of a gimmick than a movie and for that reason I was never truly engaged in the story. The traditional horror elements failed to deliver what I like about horror: namely suspense and atmosphere. And the 'twist' was somewhat predictable, stupid, and full of plot holes. There is a difference between knowingly recycling genre clichés and actually having something credible and new to say about them. ACITW never really seemed to get this distinction, and as a result it came across as a movie made by people who don't particularly understand or like the horror genre.Part of the problem is that I've reached the saturation point with these meta-exercises and after a while it almost seems like a cop-out. There are plenty of horror deconstructions out there (Scream, Behind the Mask: the Rise of Leslie Vernon, Shaun of the Dead, etc.). ACITW is better than some of them, not as good as others. Overall though it isn't any more insightful or clever than any of these similar films.I really don't want to dump all over this film because it has it's moments and if it leads some younger viewers to seek out the first Evil Dead or read some H.P. Lovecraft that's a good thing. And it definitely has more to offer than yet another half-baked remake. But I still can't help but think that the filmmakers should've just made an honest to god legitimately good and original horror movie, instead of taking the easy way out - recycling other movies and painting it all with an ironic gloss. Again, that final segment of the film finally goes balls out and finally delivers something we've never seen before. It's a shame I had to sit through so much of the same old crapola to get there.",4,17,33,23 April 2012
