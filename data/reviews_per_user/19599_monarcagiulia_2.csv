The Blair Witch Project," too interesting not to watch
","The Blair Witch Project is a 1999 American movie based on a true story. It is about three young students; Heather, Josh and Mike, who get lost in a woods while they are doing a project on the Blair Witch. They spend a week asking questions about the witch and the related legend, then they go into the woods. They are supposed to spend two days there, but they get lost, and strange things begin to occur. As the movie goes on, tension rises, reaching the highest point when the guys find a house hidden in the trees. There, what told by the legend we heard about at the beginning happens. Mike faces the wall, so we know that Josh is already dead, Mike is going to be killed, and Heater is going to be the next one. Â Even though the killing of the guys isn't shown, the end of the movie is pretty clear. The movie is a psychological horror based on the recovered footage discovered a year later after the guys' disappeared. You really become involved with it; knowing that you are watching what those guys were filming makes you feel their emotions. It scares you because you can feel the real fear. Their acting is very realistic and the use of cameras is interesting and compelling. It is not a usual horror movie, but it is still fascinating. It can be considered boring because not much happens, however I think it does catch your interest till the end. It is probably not the best movie in this genre, but it is definitely a film worth watching.",7,0,0,26 October 2017
The Shining," What was Kubrick trying to tell us?
","At first sight, The Shining may seem just like a horror movie. However, Stanley Kubrick makes it more interesting and compelling. The Shining is not just about a crazy man who kills his family, there is a lot more than that. There are different theories about this movie. What was Kubrick trying to say? Was he even trying to say something? Someone thinks the movie is about incest. Someone else says that the whole film is about the native American genocide, which I think is a more interesting theory. Starting with the initial theme song, which recalls of native music, there are many features in the film to support this theory. There are Native American decorative motifs abound, and Wendy is often dressed as a native. In the fridge scene, the portrait of a native can be seen on a can. The blood river can symbolize the blood of Native Americans killed in the genocide. These are just some of the scenes that can be interpreted as symbols. I think that The Shining is not a simple movie, but it needs to be unpacked. It needs to be watched several times before you can fully understand it. I've seen it just twice, so I can't really say that I got it all. The only thing I know is that I will never get bored watching it again and again. This movie never gets old, and that is why I believe it can be called a classic.",9,1,3,9 November 2017
