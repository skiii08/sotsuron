United 93," Proud to be an American
",I bought the movie with some hesitation. I found out that the actors had met with the real-life family members and that the families of the heroes had already seen the movie. A friend of mine said that she thought the military got bashed unnecessarily. Unfortunately the reality of that horrible day 5 years ago is we were ALL unprepared and maybe a little too confident that the days of hijacking planes were long over. As far as the government? I Love our country and am proud to be an American but facts are facts and what happened that day is accurately portrayed in United 93. My heart goes out to the loved ones of Americans that perished on Sept 11. Let us only pray that we do not ever again become so comfortable to think that we as a nation are safe or protected from this terrorism.,Null,1,4,9 September 2006
