Men in Black 3," Waste of time
","I have no idea how movie that bad can have a above 7 rating on IMDb.com OK, as a matter of fact I do have idea. People who watch this movie are either brainless or are aliens or have some kind of parasitic alien controlling their bodies. I am not going to take 100 min of your life as this movie, instead I am going to give you an advice (which surprisingly works on all new movies from Hollywood). My advice: Watch the first 10 min of the movie. It is going to tell you (99 out of 100) if you want to continue watching or quit/leave/go get drunk/do whatever else you want to do but do not waste a second more on this movie. So take it or leave it, the choice is yours. For me this movie is a total waste of time thus 1/10. Period.",1,6,14,9 September 2012
