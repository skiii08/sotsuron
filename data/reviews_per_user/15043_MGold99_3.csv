Casablanca," Yeah, it actually is that good
","I am usually skeptical of older films. Are they relevant, do they still feel fresh, will they connect with this 20-year-old generation-Y'er? Many, even 'the classics' do not--'42nd Street,' 'To Kill A Mockingbird,' among others--feel dated, out of touch, irrelevant to my life. Yet 'Casablanca' is different. There's something deeply human and personal about the story of Rick and Ilsa, and though even the most cynical viewer may be skeptical at first, one glance at Ingrid Bergman's downy and soulful eyes will dispel any doubts. Everything about this film is pretty much perfect--the script is THE Hollywood script, it is tightly paced and brilliantly plotted. Overall, a true classic that withstands the test of time. Also, makes a great drinking game--you take a shot every time they take one. You'll be on the floor, I swear.",10,2,4,15 June 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," Brilliant and hypnotic
","Though my dedication to this film sometimes freaks people out (I've been known to quote it at somewhat inopportune moments), I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of. This film is a brilliant, tightly-plotted masterpiece, a tour de force of masterful acting, absorbing dialogue, and tempo and pacing that is at once highly tense and soothingly mesmerizing. The give-and-take between Starling and Lector has an almost heartbeat-like rhythm, quiet and subtle yet extraordinarily powerful. I don't think it's inappropriate to say that this film doesn't hit any truly false notes. The main reason that my friends often won't watch this film is simply because it scares them too much -- which, I believe, is one of the film's greatest triumphs.",10,2,3,21 June 2005
Jurassic Park," Absolutely magnificent
","Of course I've read about all the things that detract from this film--the weak characters, the contrived plot, etc--but to me, this film is the ultimate reason why they invented movie theaters. Now, I was only seven when I saw it for the first time, on opening night, in 1992. Imagine yourself as a seven year old boy, not quite yet able to distinguish fantasy from reality, and suddenly you're thrust into a world like this, one where DINOSAURS are walking, moving, living all around you. It's about as fantasy-making a film as they come. I honestly feel bad for anyone who couldn't just totally lose themselves to this experience (ie, anyone older than 13 when they first saw it). It's incredible.",10,3,5,18 April 2005
