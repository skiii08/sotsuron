Walk the Line," Great Movie
","This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. I wasn't a big Johnny Cash fan, but since watching Walk The Line my son (which is 11) and I just cant get enough of him. We have always loved Reese Witherspoons movies. I have never seen many of Joaquin Phoenixs movies but will be watching for them now. Putting the two (Joaquin and Reese) together was magic. I also love there singing . The songs they sing together I love more than Johnny Cash and June singing together. This movie has really made me take a second look at Mr. Cashs life and music, and realizing how much he loved June just made my heart swell. I love this movie and recommend it to everyone.....",10,1,2,28 March 2006
