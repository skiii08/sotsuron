Iron Man 3," Dirctor and writer probably thinks we are retarded
","The story is so horrible it feels like a 5 year old wrote it. It is one huge plot hole, I felt like I was watching an episode from Ninja Turtles. Is there a shortage of writers in Hollywood? Maybe they should get someone from bollywood, they would of done a better job. The whole crew should be ashamed of what they have made.Nothing in this movie makes sense. Even if you just try to watch and enjoy it as an action movie. It seems like the crew never cared about Iron Man or Marvel universe and just did whatever they felt like. I salute the guy who cut the trailers, he did a great job.If you want to see a depressed, underpowered and stupid Tony Stark or maybe hate Iron Man for some reason. Go ahead and see this... Worst movie of the year so far.",2,47,96,5 May 2013
