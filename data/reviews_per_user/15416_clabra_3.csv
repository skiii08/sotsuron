Miracle," This was a fantastic movie!!!
","(May contain spoilers, beware!)☼☼☼☼ (Four out of Four Suns)Miracle, made to commemorate the accomplishments of the late Herb Brooks and the 1980 US Men's Olympic Hockey Team, is a dun, full of action film. The story line follows Herb Brooks developing 20 individual hockey players into a miracle working team. They beat the previously thought to be unbeatable USSR Soviet Union Hockey Team and continued on to win Olympic Gold.Kurt Russell, who portrayed Brooks, along with the rest of the cast, did an excellent job at playing their characters to the best of their abilities. Russell spent a lot of time speaking personally with Herb Brooks, as well as doing notorious research in order to bring his character to life.Overall, this is an intoxicating must-see film for everyone, whether you are a hockey fan or not. Although the film is rated PG-13, primarily for language, I believe that this film could become one of the classic favorite films for the whole family.",Null,0,0,13 March 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," BEST DEPP MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","warning: possible spoilers. (But probably not)☼☼☼☼ (Four out of Four Suns)
Although this movie has been out for a while, I thought I could put i my own opinion after watching it several hundred times. With a good plot and great casting I will give this three thumbs up (if I had that many.) Pirates gives a new edge to the boring and predictable pirate movie. The special effects should definitely not be left out. I watched the 'behind the scenes' and was amazed at how complicated it is to make the skeleton pirates and the many fight scenes that were included.However, no matter how interesting the plot, the cast for Pirates is what really makes this movie great. Kierra Knightly fits her part very well and portrays it realistically. Orlando Bloom although plays second fiddle to Johnny Depp; also adds an essential ingredient. Last but certainly not least is Johnny Depp; and the sole reason that this movie is hilarious. He has a sense of humor that will keep audiences laughing the entire time. (Ladies, see this movie if only to see Depp and Bloom, I promise you won't be disappointed;) (And to see more Depp, see Secret Window, I highly suggest it.) This movie has everything it should, captivating plot, convincing special effects and great actors. Since this movie has been released in stores, I strongly suggest you check it out; a wonderful date movie! ; )",Null,0,0,13 March 2004
Finding Nemo," This is a great movie with great characters.
","warning: possible spoilers. (But probably not)☼☼☼☼ (Four out of Four Suns)
Finding Nemo is a great movie that will capture your heart with unforgettable characters, great cinematography and something that everyone will love. There are three main characters in this movie: Dory, Marlin, and Nemo. Dory (Ellen Degeneres) is a fish with short-term memory loss that Marlin bumps into while looking for the boat that took Nemo. Her memory-loss is brought up throughout the movie but not in a way that it becomes annoying. Marlin (the father of Nemo) is afraid of the ocean. Marlin is an overdone, overprotected parent but with good reason. When Nemo was still a small egg his mother (Coral) was eaten while trying to protect all the eggs from a fishy predator. In some parts Marlin's fear is burdening while in others it is humorous. Nemo is a small fish with a small fin that causes him to be ridiculed at some times and at others makes it hard for him to do thing like swimming far distances. Disregarding his disablement Nemo wishes to be a normal fish and not always be stunted by his fathers caution.
The minor characters are unforgettable themselves. These characters come in groups. The minor characters most focused on by the script are, what I like to call the tank gang. These characters are first introduced when Nemo is dropped into the fish tank at the dentist's office. The `gang' consists of seven former ocean dwellers, all with quirky characteristics. Bloat the blow fish is just a nice, easy going guy; Deb is a fish who thinks her reflection is her sister named Flo; Peach the starfish from e-bay is the all seeing; Jacque is a French crustacean with a knack for cleaning; Bubbles is, you guessed it, addicted to bubbles. The last fish in the tank gang is Gil. Gill is a fish that greatly reminded me of the people I know who want to help me but are really more interested in helping themselves.
The cinematography of this movie is truly amazing and makes you feel as if you are in the movie. This is definitely one of the best-filmed animated movies I have seen in years. It is obvious that the artists took great care to make the movie as realistic as possible. This is proved when Dory has a nosebleed and the blood moves the way a liquid twirls when squirted into water.All in all Finding Nemo is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I only have one warning for parents: your children may take to repeating all the lines from this movie (I for one know all the lines of the movie). This movie touched my heart and imprinted characters in my brain.  I suggest this movie to all people , even those who don't see animated movies much. My parting words are: Just keep swimming.",Null,0,1,13 March 2004
