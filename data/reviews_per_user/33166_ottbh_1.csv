The New World," Good God......
","Oh my, what a grand experience this film was. Malick has an eye for the true artistic film making...Give me a break. It may be a beautiful film in many ways, however, it is not enjoyable in the least. It is one of the most boring movies I have seen in a long time. Each director has their own genre they can dig into. The problem with Malick is, that he can't seem to go anywhere else. He really needs to branch out as other directors do.It's the Thin Red Line set during the 1600s'. Nothing more.And yes...it is indeed very boring.Go and rent something else.",4,2,9,5 May 2006
