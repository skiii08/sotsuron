Airlift," Highly fictional & melodramatic depiction of a true story.
","When you say a movie is based on true events, you expect it to be at least 80-90% authentic if not 100%. But with Airlift we get a highly fictionalized & over-dramatic depiction of events based in background of true events where around 1.7 lacs Indian civilians were evacuated from Kuwait during Gulf War. Our main protagonist Ranjit Katiyal (Akshay Kumar) itself is a fictional character who is said to be churned out of 3 real people. The film largely undermines the combined efforts of then Ministry of External Affairs & Air India which played significant role in one of the largest evacuation from war zone. Instead it highlights our protagonist & another fictional bureaucrat as the MVPs. There are some parts where you'll ask yourself, did this really happen!?. Like for instance, when Ranjit fights with a bunch of Iraqi soldiers to protect a Kuwaiti woman & child risking lives of 1.7 lac Indians, & after being beaten those soldiers don't even inform their counterparts or call for back up. The pace of the film is slow & the needless songs drags it further. Akshay Kumar & Nimrat Kaur have acted well &other supporting cast have done a decent job. Eventually it becomes another melodramatic Bollywood film where fiction is sold as a true story to touch the patriotic nerve of Indians right around India's Republic Day.",5,7,21,25 January 2016

But it turns out it is more than just missing case & something more sinister is going on. Will Judy find out in time? forms rest of story.Positives: The film cleverly portrays situation of our society & deep roots of inequality, racism & caste among us. It delivers strong messages that- No matter what, never give up. Your race, your caste don't decide what will be. Anyone can do anything. The story skilfully combines elements of morale, comic & suspense giving you an entertaining ride. There're plenty of funny moments, like the scene with sloths or Nick making 'pawsicles', or underworld don Mr. Big. And as expected from Disney, all animations are top class.Negatives: Nil.Opinion: An entertaining film which succeeds in maintaining perfect balance between fun & delivering message which can be enjoyed by both kids & adults.",8,3,13,5 March 2016
Ant-Man," Smallest superhero with super-size fun
","Initially I thought Ant-Man will be Marvel's stupidest film, but I'm proved wrong. After disappointing Age of Ultron, Ant-Man brings a refreshing concept by incorporating a heist film with superhero film. Movie starts with younger Hank Pym having a fallout with Stark Industries as he feared his tech will be misused. Few years later, we meet our hero Scott Lang, an ex-con & burglar who is just out of prison, having a hard time getting a job & failing to provide child support. Salvation comes in form of Dr. Pym who offers him a shot at redemption by asking him to steal Yellowjacket suit from Darren Cross's (Pym's protégé, who invents his own version of Ant-Man suit & Pym particles & plan to sell them to highest bidder) highly secured facility. So Pym & his daughter Hope train Scott to use Ant-Man suit & also to control army of ants! There are plenty of tongue-in-cheek moments with delivery of funny lines throughout. All actors provide strong performances, but the main surprise is Michael Pena's Luis who almost steals the show with his wildly cheerful, hilarious comic performance. Action scenes are zippy & colorful with CGI heavy climax. There's no usual destruction of cities, collapsing skyscrapers or falling landmasses from sky. Wasp does make a small appearance & also an Avenger who picks a fight with Ant-Man. Overall the film is pretty good though it once again brings out marvel's problem in fabricating a very good villain. But in the end, smallest superhero provides the super-size fun.",8,3,11,24 July 2015
The Conjuring," Good horror movie with old fashioned scares.
","Reportedly based on true story, renowned paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, are called upon to investigate the most frightening & baffling case of their career. In 1971, Roger and Carolyn Perron have left suburban New Jersey with their five daughters to move to Rhode Island. But Perrons' hope for a peaceful new start is soon ruined by a powerful otherworldly entity intent on waging war against them. James Wan, director of Saw and Insidious, injects a relatively tired concept with some life here, via a neat narrative spin. Unlike most haunted house thrillers, The Conjuring doesn't focus solely on the family terrorized by a demonic entity from beyond the grave. Instead, screenwriters give us tandem narratives, framing the story within the history of the Warrens. It's a smart move, preventing us from growing too irritated with the Perron family. Wilson and Farmiga are personable and great at conveying hidden pain while Taylor and Livingston are authentic and likable. There's a lot here you'll have seen before if you're a fan of the genre. The Perrons' dog is spooked out upon arrival at the farmhouse, Roger feels compelled to investigate the dark, dangerous basement, and if a character in jeopardy suddenly pauses in apparent relief, you can be sure something will make you jump in around few seconds time. The body count is low, bloodshed is minimal & gore effects are limited to minimal towards the end. Is The Conjuring scariest movie ever made? No. But that doesn't stop film from being an enjoyable thrill ride in theater.",9,0,2,3 August 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not as bad as critics say.
","After reading negative reviews I went with lower expectations. But after seeing it, I can certainly say that it's much better to receive a meager 30% on RT & deserves around 70% score. It's not a masterpiece & it does have a few plot holes. The opening scene is great. Rest entire first half is spent in build-up & at this moment I thought- okay, this movie will be disappointing. But from 2nd half once the action starts it's only uphill. Action is amazing & it doesn't look forced or overlong like in MoS. The visuals are incredible. Fight scenes is well choreographed. The ending is totally unexpected. Ben Affleck has done decent job. This Batman is brutal & I liked it. The most amazing character for me was Wonder Woman, though her role was very small. I was a bit disappointed with Jesse as Lex Luthor. He was annoying. It is dark & serious movie though there are funny moments here & there, and I am OK with it as long as content is good. It's definitely better than Man of Steel. Comparing it to Marvel, I would say, it's better than Age of Ultron but short of The Winter Soldier.",8,1,5,26 March 2016
Deadpool," It's a different kind of Superhero movie!
","After a disastrous outing in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Deadpool is back with a bang in this insanely funny & violent entry. The tone is set right from the word go with opening credits like 'a British villain', 'a hot chick', 'a moody teen' & we are introduced to Deadpool right during the action sequence on highway which we have been seeing in trailers. After slaying goons & blowing a few heads we jump back in time & get to know how Wade Wilson was transformed to Deadpool. After the origin story, we return for more chases and fights. Deadpool is a foul mouthed jerk, a rude crude fighting machine breaking the fourth wall constantly. There's plenty of gory violence with heads blowing & hands chopping. Deadpool is funny – frequently hilarious with fun poked at his previous Green Lantern role, Wolverine & even a jab at studio for not providing enough budget. As far as story is concerned it's predictable & there aren't any surprises but surely it's very much entertaining & fun to watch. As for nudity & sex scenes, it was censored here in India so can't say much about it but there is a scene where naked Deadpool is fighting Ajax & we can see his p***s. Also some hilarious moments in sex scene montage between Venessa & Wade. In the end it's a different kind of superhero story & exactly the kind of Deadpool movie we wanted.",8,4,14,12 February 2016
