Lucky Number Slevin," Great Movie!! Reminds me of Unusual Suspects
",I'm a great great fan of thinking movies. Movies that get you to try to use all parts of your brain and keep you up and concentrating on the plot. This was definitely one of them. It does remind me of the same grain of movie as Unsual Suspects. If you haven't seen that one definitely check it out!!! I just got finished from watching it with my husband and although we were both tired we stayed on the couch to continue watching. There aren't that many movies that come out that actually engage further than a brief thought so this is a movie that should be added to the DVD collection because it is worth another watch not because it was on sale for 3 for $20.,Null,0,1,2 October 2006
