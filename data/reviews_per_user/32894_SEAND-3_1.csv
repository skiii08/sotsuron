The Blair Witch Project," What you need to enjoy the Movie.
","Here is a list of what you need to enjoy the movie.1.  The ability to suspend disbelief, and buy into the lost footage idea.2.  Don't set high expectations based on other Horror films you have seen.3.  Spend a night in the Deep woods alone or with only one friend or family member.  (I did wilderness survival courses as a kid, and can tell you that w/o the proper instruction or even with it a night in the woods can be scary enough w/o creepy legends)One of the scariest movies I have ever seen, and I have seen everything deemed Horror.  In fact the only things that scare me anymore are on the nightly news, and shows like 'The New Detectives' series on Discovery.In fact I would also suggest that you see the movie alone, and at a theater that is not in your part of town.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
