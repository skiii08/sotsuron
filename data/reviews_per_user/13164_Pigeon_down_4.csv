The Incredible Hulk," Bad Casting, Feeble Antagonists, Slow Movie
","Norton is fine in this. He plays the role of Banner quite well. Both he and Liv Tyler come out of this review largely unscathed. Tim Roth is over rated as ever. His character is just silly and his fate just as silly.The worst IMO is the General, Hurt is awful. His fake hair and moustache, his make up is as bad as the Hulk CGI (which given the age of this film is almost, almost understandable).There were so many things in this film that made no sense:1. Why was a UK officer (stated to be from the Royal Marines - which are not special forces at all but really just a light infantry unit) wearing a US Army uniform along with a chest full of US ribbons?2. Cuts on the Hulk after the fight at the uni - you can see them on his shoulders - inconsistent with the rest of the MCU where such things don't happen even when he's dragged down a building or hit numerous times by Iron Man's Hulk smashing suit.3. Guatemala - erm, so how close is that to Brazil?4. The Apache Gunship crashes in Hulk and Liv Tyler, surrounding them in an inferno of jet fuel. Hulk stands up holding her in the midst of what must be 1000 degree flames and stares - by which time she'd be barbecued.5. Blomsky - he has an incredibly weedy body, yet he seems to have abilities far beyond that body. I just didn't take to him at all as a credible opponent to the Hulk, let's be honest, Hulk would just pull him in half effortlessly, Blonsky as the adversary is patently ridiculous.There were more issues i spotted in the movie, but back to the bigger picture.The Incredible Hulk is a movie that is best forgotten in the MCU. It's doesn't really contribute or fit in. Hulk/Banner as played by Ruffalo is great. I don't think a stand alone Hulk film works at all. The character (Hulk) simply does not have the finesse to be a hero in a movie taking on baddies. He's too reckless, smashing everything, so is better suited as a side kick within the context of the broader avenger movies.",3,0,2,27 April 2019
12 Years a Slave," Sufficient to sadden my heart
","There were few times within this movie where I didn't find myself disgusted, ashamed, and horrified at the evils that humans can inflict on each other.As a 200lb, white male, former MMA fighter, I found myself moved to tears at the treatment and cruelty imposed on my fellow brothers and sisters within this film. To see a man kidnapped from his family and placed in slavery, a woman separated from her children all suffering such abuse. If movies are designed to elicit powerful emotions through their portrayal then this succeeded with me.I know slavery has existed for a long-time, Greeks had slaves, Romans took slaves from Europe including northern Europeans. The most famous slave in history is perhaps Spartacus, who fought for his freedom against the Romans. Yet this portrayal set during pre civil war America once again highlights the incredible evils that society can allow itself to accept and consider normal, enforceable, lawful.The sense of sadness I felt whilst watching this film, not just for Solomon but for all of the victims in this film, combined at times with rage and a desire to fight in defence of these trapped and fearful people.Hopefully, despite this movie largely portraying white men and women in the role of oppressor, people will realise that racism and slavery have historically been colour blind with abuse against all races. Hopefully, we recognise from the evils of this period how we should all be united against such evils and seek to stand together in protection of all.Thank you for this movie.",10,4,6,31 March 2014
Creed II," A Boxing Film For Non Boxers
","It's not a bad movie, the scenes are largely well shot (Outside of the ring), the acting is largely ok, the set, consume, lighting all ticks the right boxes. Where this goes wrong is the plot is very weak, and it is pointlessly weak.Victor Drago, the son of Ivan Drago is fighting in warehouses in the Ukraine, spotted by a promoter, next thing he is in the US challenging the World Heavyweight Title holder (Adonis Creed).So here is the rub, no back street warehouse fighter is ever going to get a shot at the world heavyweight title because he has no fight lineage. Victor would need to be on the rankings to get a title sanctioned shot, and yet he's fought no one that is a contender. This means the premise is pretty silly, as is the idea that some big warehouse fighter could actually KO a tier one boxer.All they needed to do to fix this was show the rise of Victor through the rankings and establish some sort of fearsome KO trend that really built press support for the fight between him and Creed.On the boxing side, Rocky seems to have one game plan in every fight - learn to take a lot of damage because the more damage you take the more impervious you become to it??? Yep that is like telling a tyre, the more worn down you get the more impervious to getting worn down you become. Oh, and lifting weights, getting bulked up, all that is critical in boxing, forget the fact that the worlds greatest boxers can slip and cover (Think Sugar Ray, Mayweather etc) so they are new impossible for meathead fighters to hit.The strength of the Rocky franchise has always rested in the humanity of Rocky and his struggle with life and poverty, his desire to overcome his life challenges etc. Stallone has over stretched this in the past, the movies moved from the great breakout of Rocky 1 and 2 to the increasingly silly 4 and 5 and whatever the heck that come back in your 60's was called. Trading off the past success and building new chapters that lack the story integrity only serves to weaken the memory of the former films. But, i'm sure they made good at the box office.Creed 2 is a movie that could've been much better, and it wouldn't have cost much if anything to fix the plot holes.Creed 2 still suffers from unbelievable boxing scenes where a fighter is punched full in the face with huge shots and takes several of them shaking them off. Neither Creed not Drago look like good boxers in this movie, they look like meatheads throwing big shot combo's. There is no finesse, but hey it is a movie. However, because the backstory building to the fight is so weak, the belief in it undermines the out of the ring content about family life, rocky and him missing Adrian, the minor piece about the light not working - those more real to life elements are weakened by being attached to the silliness in the core premise.The Creed movies are a nice attempt at extending the brand life of Rocky, although it really is time to call it a day now.",5,0,1,4 April 2019
Alien: Covenant," The Greatest Questions Ever Asked Baked Into An Episode Of Scooby Doo
","I entered the cinema with high hopes but moderate expectations. Promethus held promise. Standing alone it was another Sci Fi movie, but in the context of a larger narrative, it could be redeemed.What Ridley offers is in effect one of the greatest questions ever asked baked into an episode of Scooby Doo - complete with the fact that the Caretaker did it, and classic lines like, 'Let's split up to search'. Alien Covenant (AC) starts well. Its opening scene is both weak and strong. Weak in the sense that Peter Weyland (Pearce) when discussing the more philosophical themes barely seems to have a real grasp on the nature of the questions he ought to be thinking about, and David (Fassbender) makes basic observations but completely misses the big questions he ought to be asking (It's the kind of philosophical questioning i'd expect from high school students and not from the leader of major space exploration company or a cutting edge droid - to me this was a warning that this film hadn't been thought through enough, or if it had, the people doing the thinking were not as smart as the franchise really needs). Strong in that it opened the door and made me think this movie really might go in the right direction and offer the kind of depth this franchise needs to be more than a lucky monster flick set in space. Other reviewers have listed a litany of issues with this movie. I will offer some which IMO were the most troubling, not just with the movie, but reveal the lack of thought, or a blatant the disregard of the audiences intellect by the writers. The crew - Let's be frank, you wouldn't let this lot crew an oil tanker across the pacific let alone be in charge of 2000 colonist lives. The crew resembled an AA meeting, or perhaps a collection of Occupy Artists. What they did not resemble was a crew of individuals educated and qualified to be in space. The average 'trolly dolly' on a United Airlines flight would've done a more rational and sensible job over those in this movie. Sci Fi as a genre can be really poor or stunning. It can dredge the lows of the genre or set out a really solid story with a highly intelligent characters in which events unfold that genuinely stretch the thinking of the brightest viewers and land new ideas or expound on old questions in an original way that leaves the audience thinking about the depth of the movie long after it is over. AC in not the latter and is most assuredly heading toward the former. With a crew this bad you begin to see why i have likened the film to Scooby Doo, because effectively we have Shaggy, Scooby, Wilma, and Fred etc haplessly wandering around on an alien planet only to find out that the villain is ...wait for it....David the caretaker. In this movie i learned - That an advanced race of aliens (the engineers) have no air traffic control protocols or security measures. That their population exists in a place similar to the Vatican square. That you can just fly in and bomb them all with no problems. That they build out of stone and seem to have excellent eyes as well lit rooms are not important to them. The Engineer concept is great and was a great introduction idea in Prometheus, but it has been unpacked very poorly to the detriment of the concept.The movie also fails to address 'growth', how a xeno can grow inside a human at that rate without absorbing material, and once out of the host move from about a foot in size to about 10 feet tall without consuming organic matter to fuel its growth? You can't have intelligent science fiction without addressing these major holes Ridley, and if you're not doing intelligent science-fi than you're making B movie junk. David and Walter - the moment David cut his hair we could all tell where this was going. But for a crew like this, i'm sure that went right past them. The same crew that has just one landing ship and chooses to try to land during a storm, that rather than sending a drone to explore the planet sends the crew, that rather than flying over the signal area in a first pass lands 8 miles from their objective and decides to walk, that wears no protective gear beyond 1950's Norwegian Kagools, that smoke, sniffs plants of unknown make up, washes their face in alien water... the list of stupid goes on and on and on. So you see, you combine one of the most important questions ever asked 'where does life come from, who is our creator' with Shaggy, Scooby, and the Gang and hey presto - Alien Covenant. Finally, the explanation of David as flawed (the reference to Shelley vs Byron) struggles to address the pointlessness of David's quest. Unless David is purely in psychopath territory his quest seems misguided. All life forms share some degree of intelligence, it is our intelligence that is a common factor, a unifying factor. Yes we behave differently, but all species evolve and typically evolve up to greater intelligence. Therefore intelligence is the real directional marker, not life itself. Where is intelligence going? Producing xenomorph's that behave like ants is a step back. It doesn't address any question. It's nothing more significant than playing with biological Lego. I'd expect a 'being' like David to see this. To see into the complexity and realise that biological forms are all moving in a direction that brings them closer in the end not further away but then to wonder why and where this might end.",4,4,8,4 June 2017
