Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I am scarred for life after seeing the nude fat guy wrestle a nude Borat
","This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen! This movie is a a sad collage of rip-offs from shows like 'Jackass' with the twist that it is about a mockumentary of a foreigner's trip to the U.S.The only reason for the popularity of the film that I can see is that people must like it because it makes foreigners look stupid by placing the main character, Borat, in juvenile disgusting and embarrassing positions where he is making a fool out of himself and humiliated without even realizing what is happening.The worst scene had to be a nude Borat wrestling his naked fat friend on the bed...like I said above, I scarred for life. Every time I see a fat or a dark foreign guy on the street or in an elevator that horrid image is going to pop into my head.What is ever worse yet, I took my 13 year old and his friend to this disgusting attempt of humor and will have to explain to the other boy's parents when he talks about seeing two naked guys wrestling on a bed, a naked boy's penis, a guy taking a dump in front of Trump Tower and attempt to kidnap Pam Anderson.",1,17,35,27 December 2006
The Exorcist," Makes you pray that there is a God
","I first saw this movie when I was 14, only two years older than the 'possessee'. At the time, I was agnostic; when I left the movie, I was praying there is and was a God.By today's cinematography standards, the film may seem hoaky and ridiculous, but the plot still and acting is still very well-developed and convincing. I find it even harder now to watch as I am a parent and can relate more now to the role of a parent watching over instead of the 'victim' and since the initial screening have not been able to watch it in its entirety, even on 'regular' TV where the worst has been edited out.After becoming a Christian, have learned that possession and the devil are real, which makes this movie all the more frightening. Watch at your own risk!",10,0,1,11 April 2005
Batman Begins," Major disappointment due to extreme miscasting..
","While outstanding performances are given by Christian Bale as Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Liam Neeson as the guru/bad guy, they are nullified with the poor and unbelievable casting of the rest of the characters.Katies Holmes (Rachel Dawes) is not believable in the role she has been cast in as Assistant D.A. and comes off more as a little girl playing dress up, especially with the contrast of the powerful charisma of Christian Bale. There was no on screen chemistry and I just was just not buyable that Bruce Wayne would pine for Cillian Murphy is another major miscast in this movie; he is neither old enough or a good enough of an actor to bring across the sinister deception that this character needed to be believable. Incidentally, Gary Oldman, who was cast in the move as the 'good cop' would have been perfect for the role.This movie is not even worth at the $2.50 rental that was paid, even if you are a die hard Batman fan, wait 6 months and rent it from the 50c ent movie section as it really isn't worth more than that.",1,9,21,19 October 2005
