Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a great movie but good all the same
",First off i wish everyone would leave this movie alone. OK yeah its not as good as episodes 4-6 and Jar Jar Bink's just needs a punch in the face but lets just forget about all that. Instead lets look at the good points. The start of this movie is amazing. Up until Obi-wan and Qi-gon go down to Naboo. Then OK yeah its starts to suck a lot and the less said about the pod race the better. But when you get over that you have to see that Qi gon jinn is one of the best Jedi in any of the movies. And Darth Maul is just amazing. I just wish i could go back in time (like almost every star wars fan) meet up with George Lucas and make him re-write almost all of it and for god sake don't kill Darth Maul! Come to think of it what was the point in doing that? He could have done the same job as Dooku and done it better in episode 2. Rant over,6,1,7,1 October 2010
