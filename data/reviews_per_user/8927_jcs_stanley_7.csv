The Avengers," The Box-Office shall be Hulk-Smashed...
","GRAAAAH! Oh my god. The sheer power of this film, how it is able to pull of one big magic trick and somehow cram everything in without coming off as a bloated or lazy being that lives off a diet of eye-candy and Clich√©s. No. Absolutely No! The avengers takes the harder but more fulfilling route making it more of a god like the mighty Thor, and god that deserves attention and respect for all mankind.I have personally seen this film twice and not once has it's quality withed with each viewing. It has genuine sense of epicness and suspense that almost makes you think everything will be all right in the end, Meance provided by Loki resonates perfectly, in fact in one of his scenes I felt my heart rate going up! literally. If you only know a bit about the film before seeing it, ;et me tell you he does things that you'd didn't expect which only adds to it all. The visual splendor is huge and with the acting coupled with it believable. The fight sequences can be narrowed down to three things: Tesserect theft, Hellicarrier attack and NY final showdown. It makes you stay on for the ride, it makes wish it could have gone on. Even my family found themselves in joyful hysterics at the end of it!",10,2,5,28 April 2012
The Hangover," Chaotic, stupid ,but very funny
","Nothing more then a deranged completely unashamed thrill ride of laughs, This film delights itself in mocking, teasing and outright twisting things that would normally be frowned upon if they were ever committed in real life.Showing a fairly accurate portrayal of how things can get out of control in Vegas, The film follows the exploits of Phil, Stu and Alan. Three guys who one day go out on a stag-night to the city of sin itself before a wedding with Groom-to-be Doug who goes missing the following day next morning leading to the three trying to piece together the events of what exactly happened during that crazy last night in which they were all tipsy and out of their minds.Characters swear like sailors, Propert is broken and smashed, Danger is made a complete laughing stock, all put together to form one anacarhic and funny comedies. I especially laughed at the 'pretending to ***k a tiger scene. With the amount of raunchy jokes and a scene of full frontal male nudity, This is definitely not one for the kids or grandparents.",10,3,4,14 January 2012
The Hangover Part II," Funny though slightly Bankoked up.
","Essentially the overall film basically just follows the same format that the original had but this time the ever raunchy Chaos is erupting in Bangkok, Thiland with even more Crudness, Frontal-nudity and scenes that will either offend or amuse you. New additions to this crazy sequel include a Monkey who smokes and deals drugs for bananas, Lady-boys (eep), A cut off finger and Stu getting a tattoo Fused onto his skin! When you watch the film you quickly realise that this no ordinary Rehash. It's actually one that offers a lot more Adultness that even the likes of South Park or Family Guy could ever dream of.Being much bigger, The Sequel tends to veer into much darker black-hole content and comedy than the first, But still retains the Madness and hi-cap Hiluarity that helped the original make a name for itself. This sequel will either overall feel like a demented scientific clone Of The first one or The original Upgraded into into something even bigger depending on how you feel. I reckon it will probably feel like both.",7,0,0,15 January 2012
Puss in Boots," Critics, don't make the cat angry!
","Dreamworks has practically mastered the majority of generes in this world. Shrek conquerd 'Fantasy', Megamind took over 'Superhero' and Kung Fu Panda went up to 'Martial Arts, said 'Skadoosh!' and blasted it up into the heavens were the Box-office gods reside. Now Dreamworks has succefully charmed and beaten (sort of) the 'Spanish Western' with Puss in Boots which shows the life of the Zorro-esque cat before he was kicking it with a certain Green ogre and a Certain Talking Donkey.In general the plot is a fun complete with a murderous outlawed married couple, The Origons of Puss and his rather tense relationship with egg-shelled mastermind and Childhood friend Humpty Dumpty, A plot to steal Golden eggs from a giant's castle, Magic Beans, A cat that says 'ooooohhh..', Puss attempting to fix a broken reputation, and a showdown with (I'm not kidding) a GIANT freaking Goose named uh, Mother Goose/The great terror! It might not have that big of a climax, However Puss in Boots offers enough Spectacular Visuals, Voice-acting, Computer Animation and Humor to make this film a worthy addition to 2011's final line-up of films.",9,7,9,21 December 2011
Rio," The Ice team goes samba!!!
","Rio is possibly one of the best animated films I have seen in a long time! I first saw this in the spring of 2011 when me and mum went down to the cinema in Crawley. The film was done by the same people who spawned the equally brilliant Ice age movies which I have seen too. the film was directed by Carlos Saldanha who did Ice Age 2+3. A lot of people say Saldanha can't direct as well as Chris Wedge (who directed the original Ice Age film) due to 2+3 getting a more mixed word of mouth than the first one, but what I have seen from Rio is amazing which shows that Saldanha knows his Brazillian stuff if not his cold sub-temperature skills. Overall Rio was good. The animation was colourful and cheerful, the characters were fun to watch, the joke's were funny and the voice acting was well.. good. If you like feel-good family films mu friend then this is the movie for you!",Null,0,0,8 August 2011
Prometheus," The equivalent of mixing ' Alien' with 'Avatar'.
","In all my life I have never seen something so awe-inspiring yet terrifying, Prometheus is that very thing I'm describing to you! Before watching this I had never seen the original 'Alien' nor do I plan to. Instead I looked up. I studied it, dissected it, learnt it's inner most works to prepare me for what Prometheus has to deliver.So does Ridely Scotts's long anticipated that's sorta prequel to Alien but isn't pay-off??? The answer it happens is yes. Not only does it deliver with incredible visuals and technology almost on-par with what James Cameron has made for his vision of the future, Prometheus provides a genuine sense of fear and tensity to itself especially mid-way with some pretty nasty alien attack and a Caserian scene that wouldn't be allowed on 'One born every minute' even if it were re-cut multiple times, Quarintend , Disinfected and given a lollipop afterwards.And Speaking of Re-cutting, I actually glad 'Prometheus' wasn't butchered and forced to line a life of '12A' because any cuts would have severely water-down the force and and energy of the film and What Scott was trying to achieve. While the likes of 'The Hunger Games' and 'Hot fuzz' are excellent in their own violent rights, their Gashing is almost wussy-like compared to Promethues because Scott is crazy and brave enough goes to places of stomach that most wouldn't consider.The Acting in the film was amazing and well thought out, the ones that stand out the most for me are Noomi Rapace's Liz Shaw and Michael Fassbender's David. I swear to god if Fassbender isn't nominated for the award for 'Best Actor' at the BAFTAs along with Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk), critics will have me to deal with, He deserves a big fat golden face for him to take home.In conclusion that the film has best cliff-hanger ending period. If you've watched 'Alien' before it'll knock yer socks off.",8,3,10,2 June 2012
Despicable Me," Steam rollin, whatever I see, uhhh huh... Despicaple Me!
","Despicable me falls into what I like to call the bad is the new good category in which villainy is the focus but ends up becoming good. only three films exist in this category This one, Igor and Megamind (with a fourth due in 2012 by Disney). Despicable is also the few other computer-animated films out their capable of taking on flagship studios like Dreamworks and Pixar. Don't think of Despicable Me as another lame family film because it's not, it's actually a good one. Kids will no doubt lap this one up as if it was melted chocolate and adults will find themselves entertained by this heart-warming,humorous and clever animation flick which borrows rather smartly from War bros. cartoons and other more higher-ranking studios as opposed to just ripping them off. Kids will obviously fall for the yellow minions in the film with Their cute looks, Irresponsible ways and bizarre native dialect. It also has some great voice talent from numerous A-list actors e.g Steve Carrel, Russel Brand and Jason Segal IF people were to look back at this film in say about 10 years time they will probably consider it the 5th best animated movie ever (Behind A Nightmare before Christmas, Shrek, South Park: Bigger,longer and uncut and of course Toy story umm.. what should I go for here Toy story 1, 2 or 3? I can't decided cause their such good films.",Null,0,0,13 August 2011
