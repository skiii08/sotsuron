","First of all I could mention that the movie itself was one of the most intense movies I have ever seen. From the first part of the movie, we see main character struggling to find a weapon, that he will use to join militia forces. Sound of a plane and a plane itself that appears during that scene creates absolutely intense and scary feeling, creating strange feeling towards his choice to join militia. Second of all movie's plot points and acts are unpredictable. At first you might think that after joining militia, he and he alone will save the Belarussians from terrible life that they're in. Fortunately story shifts so powerfully that every single step is absolutely shocking. When I saw the scene in woods, after main character met the girl, for one second only, I thought this is going towards Hollywood love story. But what happened next absolutely demolished any ideas of boy and girl being together. One more thing - special effects - the way they present the explosions is incredibly realistic and can be put in documentary category. The acting in the film is astonishing. The idea that the actors are always close to the explosions is very terrifying. And of course the scene with the swamp is one of the best struggle scenes ever. No one really knew what is inside the swamp and what might happened. The scene is presented in such a realistic way, that sometimes I felt like being there and seeing them. The last thing that I would like to mention is the whole story of a movie. Although the movie is about one boy, who becomes a man, while trying to survive, we constantly feel the pain of people that suffered consequences of the war. I am from country that is incredibly close to the Belarussia and I have always heard the stories and learned the facts and numbers about what happened and thanks to this movie, people that were not aware of what was happening in that part of the world were introduced to the pain and suffer that Belarussians went through.",9,2,2,31 May 2012
