Raiders of the Lost Ark," Haters of the Lost Ark
","I guess you can say I am a hater of this movie, even though I don't think it's that bad. It's just not that good either. Don't get me wrong, the music and Indiana character are both iconic. Everyone knows the theme and recognizes the hero with the hat and whip. I think that's why this movie gets so much hype. It's so iconic and nostalgic that people overlook everything else.The story is pretty mindless. It's a race to see who can find the ark first. Indy always gets outsmarted by the other guys but manages to escape again and again. There's no real dialog that has any depth to it and as great as the soundtrack is, it is also distracting. The ending is kind of lackluster. I mean, the face melting is cool, but afterwards it just ends with no real resolution.In my opinion, it's just an ok action/adventure movie that happens to have a really charismatic and iconic hero. I'm not even a fan and I was Indiana Jones for Halloween one year. But if you want a great adventure movie, there are others that beat this by a mile. In my opinion, the Goonies is a 10x better adventure movie. The characters have emotions and a reason to fight, the bad guys are funny but not in a cheesy way, the soundtrack is incredible but not intruding, and the ending has a true resolution that leaves you smiling. To me, that's a 10/10, which is why this is a 6/10.",6,0,2,23 January 2020
Rosemary's Baby," High reviews are misleading
","I was always told this was a good movie so I decided to give it a chance despite its age and long run time. It kept my interest at first and had a pretty creepy scene that was kind of trippy. The problem is the movie is extremely predictable to everyone watching it except for the main character. She's like the typical horror movie actress the characters in Scream make fun of. Clueless and helpless. Maybe they call this a classic because it's classically bad and campy. The ending takes forever to get to and doesn't deliver. I don't know how so many people like this movie, but I guess a lot of people like Nickleback too.",4,2,7,4 October 2019
