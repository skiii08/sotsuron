The Blair Witch Project," I guess I must be in a distinct minority who didn't know!
","This movie really captivated me, as I went in fairly knowledgeable about the content.  But like those who were told not to give away the 'secret' in 'The Crying Game,' I must have missed the point that this is simply a movie, with real-live actors who are STILL alive.  It wasn't until the film was over that I realized it was all staged. Which apparently put me in a distinct minority of viewers who went in thinking there actually WERE people who disappeared in the woods, and that actual video WAS found later. The movie itself was a two-step adventure for me.  The horror buildup, of course, but the psychological interplay between the three kids I thought was terrific.  I liked the ending, although I knew something like that was about to happen. Then when I saw the credits and realized the whole thing was fictional,I was shocked and disappointed.  I had been taken for a ride.  It wasn't until a few hours later that I began to appreciate that ride. Perhaps I was one of the fortunate few who went in expecting to see a real-life documentary, and watched innocently that way while the movie played me like a drum. Its the best 73 minutes I have spent in a movie in several years.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
