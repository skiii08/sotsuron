The Blair Witch Project," A GREAT AND POWER FULL EMPATHIC FILM
","Ok maybe the Blair Witch Project is like on the top box of the summer, but don't let that confuse you, this is not a stupid typical summer movie, and as you can see for many critics and opinions this is  not a movie for everyone. The Blair Witch Project is not a film for selfish people who just want to sit there and see a lot of special effects and people dying to feel terror, This is a totally empathic film, you have to get on the shoes of Heather, Mike and Josh to know what they're feeling, to feel the horror of the situation. Its a movie of everyones deepest fears, its about what terrify us, its about getting inside the Blair forest and share the desperation with Heather, Mike and Josh.  And let me tell you if you're willing to get inside this movie you will be scared as hell!!!.  The camera work it's essential to make you feel like you're watching your own video, something that could happen to you.  It's not about if the story is real or not, that has no importance couse The Blair Witch Project is not scary because of what you know, but of what you dont know, what you dont see, what you feel but can't explain. The witch is as real as our fears, and that's the greatness of the story.  I consider myself a horror films fan and I can say I have seen a lot of them, and believe me as I got deeper on the plot of the Blair Witch Project I started to feel this creepy feeling on the bottom of my stomach, that we horror fans love to feel but can't feel  to often. As I said before this is not a movie for everyone couse it's not a movie to see from the outside but from the inside, and believe me if you get inside it, this is truly one of the must terrifying films ever made!! This is one of those films you know its going to become a classic, and it surely deserves it.",10,1,2,22 October 1999
Pi," GREAT, AWESOME, JUST ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER
","Today I saw at last PI, I have to say that I really wanted to see this movie for a long long time and I can say it was like one million times better than what I expected and I really expected a lot. This is one of the best movies of all times, its clever, mysterious, Dark, and exciting from beginning to end, is one of those films no one that really loves a great movie should miss. The story is excellent, it plays with the minds of the audience making you wonder if its just fiction or if its real.  Also the story is based on clues that the audience has to discover to get the plot. The edition work is fantastic as well, and the music fits the intention of the film perfectly. Its not a movie for everyone, couse its a movie that makes you think for one hour and 25 minutes without giving you a break, and for a lot of people thats not their idea of a enjoyable movie, But if youre willing to see  one of the best movies ever and youre not afraid of finding the order of everything in 216 numbers then dont miss it and believe me you wont regret it!! I give it a 10/10 Its just awesome!!!!",10,1,4,26 September 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The way to tie up a piece of art
","The expectations for the third part of The Lord of the Rings were extremely high, which usually leads to a mass deception there are many good examples of filmmakers who were not able to meet the expectations of the audiences; The Wachowski brothers and George Lucas pop up in my mind immediately. Though, Peter Jackson surpassed the high hopes laid on The Return of the King. His ability as a filmmaker has never been in doubt, not even in his glorious and gory beginnings, but he really went over the top with the this saga, proving himself careful, passionate, imaginative and respectful to the work of J.R.R. Tolkien (the changes he made actually work out for the best.) Introducing us into the film with the back- story of how Smeagol became Gollum which is not included in the actual books of The Lord of the Rings, but in the Silmarilion, also by J.R.R. Tolkien, Jackson never lets the peace slow down. The quest to destroy the Ring in Mount Doom continues for Sam and Frodo, meanwhile the remaining of the Fellowship embrace war as the only option to give more time to the forsaken Hobbits. Aragorn has his hands full: he has to lead the people of Rohan and Gondor to an almost inevitable suicide, demand allegiance from the most dangerous army in Middle Earth (the Army of the Dead,) and accept, once and for all, his position as the King, the true heir of Issildur. Not an easy task for actor Viggo Mortensen, who none the less got away with a brave performance: eyes full of pain, heart drowned in doubts but, above all, his loyalty and courage shining from within. As in the previous instalments, the photography and landscapes from New Zealand are enough to make your jaw drop, let alone the special effects.This time Jackson sets his eyes in the development of the characters, leaving the action scenes aside. None the less, whenever they come the results are amazing: if you thought the battle in Helms Deep portrayed in The Two Towers was amazing, you got another thing coming. It seems that every character of this trilogy gets their chance to stand out Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Gandalf (Ian McKellan) in the Fellowship of the Ring; Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen,) Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys) in the Two Towers and, this time, Sam (Sean Astin), Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan.) Seems impossible to leave Gollum (Andy Serkis) out, who since his first appearance is magnificent. The numerous endings of the movie five in total may dishearten some casual viewers, but they're in the book (actually, Jackson even left out a whole chapter,) and they work perfectly on screen to tie a sorrowful journey, that even with some smiles, ends up with a sad and brilliant tone.",Null,0,1,25 February 2004
