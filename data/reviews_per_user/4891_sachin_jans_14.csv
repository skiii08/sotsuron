The Perks of Being a Wallflower," That infinite High School Moment
","Yes, this is that perfect High School movie I had been craving for. The only reason for me to watch this movie on the start was that it was a movie of Emma Watson. But after watching it I felt so complete. You can actually relate yourself with any one of the characters in the movie, for they are all true reflections of our High School self. A beautiful story told in a very beautiful movie. This movie can definitely complete you by all means.The most interesting part of the movie is that you will not get bored at any instance. The characters were awesome, and so was the music, cinematography and screenplay. Also the occasional jokes and the many emotional scenes can definitely move a man with a heart. It is a perfect high school movie to watch by all means. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",9,0,1,27 January 2013
Iron Man 3," Crap of a movie
","I seriously hated this movie. I mean, what the hell was it all about? Iron Man is all about Tony Stark and the whole idiotic crap about bringing more darkness and human elements in a fantasy movie that absolutely went wrong! I mean, I can contain the frustration I had after watching the movie. Mandarin was set as an idiot (and yeah, a tiny character is actually the real Mandarin (spoiler alert if you haven't seen the movie or read the wiki article!) What is it with the Marvel universe? If they just wanna make more money invest them in some other business, do not make bizarre movies as such. I mean, come on! Tony Stark looked like an idiot. Pepper becomes the damsel who saves the hero in the end by simply flicking the villain.OK, forget the marvel universe. They had Ben Kingsley, the greatest actor of all, and what the hell was he doing in the whole movie? And what the hell is it with the Warhead and multiple armors? What the hell is with the flashback? What the.... I just....I am giving it a four for the visual effects were good. Not great, just good! And this is the last of any Marvel movies that I am gonna watch (with the exception of X-Men, of course!)",4,15,30,29 April 2013
Argo," What do I think? Argo....
","I mean, damn! What kind of plot it is? This is the worst script ever. And the locations were crap. Everything is so unreal. I mean...what the heck! So what is the good side of this movie? It saved some lives! Now my review on Argo, directed by the amazing director, Ben Affleck.Turning out a true story into a really interesting movie is a great feather on the hat of the director, a sad thing being he not getting the Oscar nomination for this great effort. He also did well, as sis all the other caste. The best part about the movie is that they have remained faithful to history. This movie is a movie one definitely has to watch.",8,0,2,20 January 2013
Taxi Driver," Literally blew my mind
","I didn't expect this while watching the movie. But seriously speaking, it just blew out my mind. Robert DeNiro was certainly at his best, and so was Martin Scorcese. I still can not figure out how they made such a movie at all, considering the difficulty in portraying such a character that had so much life and yet be unique by all means.While the screenplay is excellent, one has to admire the cinematography and the direction at the utmost. Not to forget, Jodie Foster was cool even at her most tender age. This is a great movie and a must watch by all means. I recommend it to all belonging to the mankind, who wants to feel a little bit of justice within themselves. I loved this movie.",9,0,0,23 February 2013
Man of Steel," Man of Steel is perfectly alloyed!
","Yes, this is the Superman movie we all had been waiting for. This is not the best work of Zack Snyder, Nolan, Hans Zimmer or David Goyer. But this is the ultimate work of a perfect team. Yes, this movie can take you to new heights. A perfect treat for the comic nerds and movie fanatics all at once.I enjoyed the movie, every single aspect of it. Every actors have done their part beautifully, and I must admit, the movie elevated me to new levels. The best part of the story is the way it has been told. It makes us feel the Superman is more a person around us, than who just a character. Yes, this is a must watch for humans and aliens all at once.Technical aspects have been great, all because they have worked together by all means. This is also a perfect sci-fi movie, unlike any other movies you have experienced before. A must watch!",8,0,1,15 June 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," That sweet Silver Line
","Romance just happens. Luck is just chance. And love is crazy. And there's no better way to tell how crazy love is than through this movie. A beautiful movie with quite some nice touch which is really enjoyable. The script is good and so is the direction. But the performances of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence was definitely awesome.Oh yes, it is also really hilarious. You can enjoy this movie no matter where you are or what mood you are in. It is a sweet movie, filled with passion, hope and craziness in its controlled stage. Do watch this movie to cheer yourself up.",8,1,2,20 January 2013
The Intouchables," Beautiful and mesmerizing
","It has been long since I laughed, cried, and more over, felt over a movie. And this has given me all the feelings to be acquired by a man in just two hours. I have to say, I wasn't expecting much. But after watching this movie twice in one go, I have to say it now.... This is a great movie, a wonderful work and a beautiful tale as it is.The story, from the very start to the very end, is so beautiful. And the performances were mind blowing. This movie can teach you the true essence of life and friendship.I have nothing more to say, except one thing. If you are looking for a movie that can melt you literally, you should watch this one.",10,4,7,4 July 2013
Django Unchained," Amazingly awesome
","Just three men... Quentin Tarantino the Director, Quentin Tarantino the Screenwriter and Quentin Tarantino the Legend. Man! This movie is one hell of an awesome movie, nicely knitted, excellent scripted and well executed. There's lot more to say about this awesome movie. I was left with my mouth open.This one is a step ahead of Inglorious Bastards, and a great work indeed. DiCaprio rocked the movie, it is a sad thing he didn't get nominated for the Oscars. But hey, Christoph Waltz did an amazing job over here. Samuel L Jackson did a great work. No words about Django. Remember, the D is silent!Tarantino has always been exceptional, and this is one work that makes him stand apart yet again. You make me wanna ;love you more dude. A great watch, and indeed a must watch. I loved it.",10,4,11,15 January 2013
Lincoln," A totally Worth-It movie
","I had to go through some articles regarding the 13th Amendment and the Civil War in order to get along with this movie. But seriously, this movie was worth the trouble I took. The last months of the great legend has been narrated so beautifully, that I realized why Steven Spielberg will always remain a great director. This is hes best biopic since Schindler's List. The movie follows a steady pace, and has a really good turn at every edge of it.In such a beautifully shot movie,. the next amazing factor is none other Daniel Day Lewis. But he is never their i the movie, it is all about Lincoln. Robert DeNiro was the next who baffled me. Great casting indeed.To feel the depth of a man who could change the world single handed, and to hold the key role in abolishing slavery, man, I respected the legend, and the crew behind this awesome movie. A great watch indeed.",9,2,5,17 January 2013
Les Mis√©rables," One of the best musicals I have ever come across
","To enjoy while everyone sings out their joys, anger, sadness and the epiphany to attain while watching every single move of the person on stage. I could experience it only when I watched the theatrics, but here I get the complete orgasm of movie watching when I watch this one. Staying true to the book, the musical has done a great job in captivating me inch by inch. Tom Hooper has yet done an amazing job as a director.Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathwaway have blown me off, literally, while Russel Crowe rocked wherever he went. Though Amanda Seyfried was as lame as she always is, every other character in this movie have given life to this historic masterpiece from Victor Hugo.The cinematography is yet another factor be praised, and so is the art direction.. This is one movie where one will be able to see the efforts of an entire crew that completes a movie with perfection. A great watch indeed.",8,5,9,26 January 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Extremely brilliant, but I couldn't digest it
","Perhaps it is the contest that got me off the hook. The basic plot itself wasn't digestible for me. But let me be frank with you. The direction is excellent. The screenplay is awesome. The performances were marvelous. Bruce Willis, Tilda Swinton and Edward Norton were at their best, while the children were epic. I just cannot believe how this story went through me. It is the basic plot that I couldn't get along with, hence I give it lesser marks than anyone else who had seen and enjoyed this movie.Indeed this is a great effort taken by the team, so I appreciate what they have done. But frankly, it is not a movie I will watch again. I didn't have any problem while watching Little Miss Sunshine in the similar terms, hence I do not know why this movie was not digestible to me. (Only those who watched the movie will understand what I mean.) Bottom line, it is a good movie to watch for all.",6,0,0,5 February 2013
Looper," Closing the loop ion a beautiful way...
","A really great story that is told beautifully told. Yes, they have added two really unbelievable patterns, one introduced only to bring a twist in the tale. But so nicely the story is narrated, that the story will go just fine.In a normal basis I woulds say that the senior did his best. But Joseph Gordon Lewitt did an amazing job as Joe, and of course, no comments about Bruce Willis. The direction was simply splendid, and the screenplay, which if one small mistake was made would go crappy, went excellent. Congratulations to the writer who did an excellent job over there.But yes, there are still questions in the end that are quite unclear. But I am not going to write any spoilers over here. It is up to you to decide. Bottom line, I loved the movie.",8,2,5,17 December 2012
Heat," Spoiler Alert - This movie is simply awesome!
","My primary reason to watch this movie is that Rick Castle from the series Castle is a fan of the movie. But me watching the movie the second time was purely because the movie rocked by all means. Yes, there is a bank heist gone wrong, yes, there is a good criminal and yes there is that rookie detective. So what is unlikely? Nothing but the fact that there is no exaggeration. The story goes in a plain simple mode, that is the right way of striking the iron hot. This movie is indeed a masterpiece by all means, and I am all over it.I am not saying anything about Pacino and De Niro, they always rock. Val Kilmer surprised me, and so did the other caste. Michael Mann has done a beautiful job here, and every bit of the movie is as moving as it should be. A great watch indeed.",9,0,2,9 January 2013
Cloud Atlas," Disappointed, but for some reason making an effect in me
","I couldn't find any connection at all, except them saying that every life is interconnected. I believe that all can not make a good story. The individual story lines are quite good, all connected by a unique birth mark, but to what? The whole point of the story is either missing, or is quite difficult to understand. I couldn't grasp a single thing on what was actually going on, except that when viewed individually, each story sounded good.Tom Hanks has done a great job, and so has Hugo Weaving, Ben Whishaw and Halle Berry. The movie has a lot of things that people may like, so you rather be the judge of this movie, since this is my single opinion, unbiased and purely based on what I felt when I saw this movie. I was personally disappointed, and that's it.P.S. I can not stop thinking about this movie. It seems like it has made some kind of effect in me. I am increasing the ratings by two pints",6,0,2,27 January 2013
