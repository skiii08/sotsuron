United 93," Politically correct Euro centric news report version
","If a film maker is going to try to make money off an event that I cherish this close to the event, and make most of his money off Americans, he darn well ought to produce a film that I find patriotic and uplifting as an American.This one does not.It is a politically correct CNN/Al Jazeera paint by the numbers rendition of the events. It displays the human side of the terrorist more than it does those who are their victims. It displays the uprising of the passengers not as heroic, inspired and noble, but as a some folks who just decided they might as well.I would not have contributed my money to profit this film maker's bank account if I had known ahead of time it was going to be so worried about projecting a 'balanced' voice (from a European's perspective no less) that it could not truly honor the sacrifice of those who stood up on that plane and prevented terrorist from achieving the greater bloody propaganda coup they would have achieved had they reached Washington.It is mildly entertaining because it has such a noble story to work with. But, it steals the honor from the very heroes it seeks to profit from by feeling compelled to show the 'human side' of those who came to murder those on that plane and in Washington. 0 out of 10 and negative numbers would be better.",1,6,56,9 May 2006
Darkest Hour," There should probably be three ratings for 'Darkest Hour': film, history and 'what if' history
","As a film goer, I give it a 10. It conveys a sense of the greatest moments in world history with the type of emotion such an event deserves. As an aside, it, by comparison, shows where the other movie on the event 'Dunkirk' failed so miserably. 'Dunkirk' took one of the most riveting, awe inspiring events in history and made it play out like a few guys stuck in an elevator in a burning building. 'The Darkest Hour' carried the film goer into Churchill's drama and helped the movie goer experience it as the turning point in history it was. Now, as to the actual history, as many films do to capture the emotion referenced above, it seems to have dropped out some very important aspects of the historical event. Not being a true historian of the period, I would note it disserved the sacrifice and valor of the French army that fought and died to buy Churchill the time needed to get his army off the beach. There may have also been historical inaccuracies in how and why Churchill played out the political hand he had to work with - BUT, what I think it captures well is that Churchill was the guy who had two diametrically opposed routes, capitulate and Hitler would have governed Europe for who knows how long, or lead England into a win or die war. He insisted upon and charged full ahead into the latter and, at a minimum, saved the world from a period of Hitler ruling Europe (the level of his race genocides were not known that that time). Lastly, there is the 'what if' historical questions that are mostly left un-inspected. It would be a whole different film, almost a sci-fi one, if they had been dealt with. What I mean is, the pacifist/peace at almost any cost people were not as wrong and/or ignorant as post war sentiment casts them. As someone noted above, the cost of going to war and defeating Hitler was financially staggering and diminished the UK to a second/third tier power after the war. Obviously the cost in lives and human terms was staggering as well. But for Hitler later veering off into genocide, would 'what if' history have Britain looking as bad for making a deal with Germany to subsist in some form along side a unified Europe under German domination? In a historical context, how different is that history from today's 'history' post Brexit? In my opinion this film can't be castigated for not going more into the latter two issues. Films that try to tell too many big stories almost always fail. It captured the emotion and sacrifice that led to a defining moment in history very well. And I can not say often enough how it did that very well while 'Dunkirk' was an abject abomination on that score. It took a huge, emotionally riveting historical event and somehow made it seem small and tepid.",10,1,7,31 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," No drama, little acting, nice effects
","For an average film it was A-OK. For what should be a blockbuster, it was below par. The biggest problem was there was nothing compelling except the special effects... and they didn't have the 'wow' factor the original did with surround sound. There are no surprises. Nothing to wonder what will happen next. The love story is not made interesting and, when you add in dialogue that is simply without pizazz, you are left waiting for battles and effects to make it worth your while -  and it doesn't.",4,0,0,20 May 2002
Dunkirk," Took an dramatic event of epic proportions and made it seem small and ponderous
","My expectations for this film where high. Its a great story. Not giving away any spoilers to note its history: a 400,000 man British army trapped at the start of World War II. Under constant Germany attack, strafing and attack on land and sea. Rescued by a flotilla of average citizens.And, while visually compelling, the action scenes come across almost as rehearsed. Little drama. Slow for such a riveting story line. Most of the army characters seem like they are either demoralized zombies or weaklings scurrying anywhere to save themselves.Even the character who represents all the brave citizen sailors who risked everything to come to the aid of their military men comes across as more fatalistically compelled than heroic. An event of heroism on an epic scale is broken down into individual groups cast in a light with little of it. Its a large, compelling, riveting story, that the movie maker turns into small, slow, uncompelling and, frankly, almost an amateurish, paint by numbers yawner. It is a story that deserved a far better film rendition.",5,29,59,21 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," More 'The Breakup' than good comic book hero action
","Obviously, I am in the minority, judging by other ratings. However, this movie reminded me more of the rom/com that was neither romantic nor comedic, The Breakup, than an comic action movie.While the action scenes were fine, the plot had viewers sitting and watching their parents fight and screaming 'good one Mom!' 'Way to pound her Dad!' I mean, really, what are these characters supposed to be for viewers? HEROES. How does one enjoy watching one hero beat up, not a bad guy, but a good guy? Another character that is supposed to be your 'hero'.To borrow from an old phrase, with fans like that, what comic book hero needs enemies.And a bit of a spoiler alert, the ending is much like the resolution in The Breakup as well. An hour and 46 minutes to get that?! Obviously, I must be taking the roles of the comic book heroes too seriously. Much like Batman v. Superman, fans watching them bash EACH OTHER for a couple of hours seems to be good fun for many. To me, it just seems the writers have run out of good plot lines and have turned to eating their own tails, so to speak.",1,22,46,9 May 2016
Quantum of Solace," Main fault? It ain't a Bond film
","(Spoilers) First, I've never been a big fan of the Bond franchise. I've seen most of them and would call myself a fair weather fan. The good ones are OK, take them or leave them otherwise.But, I just caught the last one at the dollar show and was simply amazed by what it was and what it wasn't.I remember remarking on here awhile back that it was curious that the latest Bond flick was rated better by women on IMDb than guys, considering what Bond flicks were. Well, now I understand. The latest incarnation of 'Bond' bears almost no resemblance to what the original Bond recipe was all about.Originally it was about a suave, macho lady's man (in the way feminists reviled) who used gadgets and brains to beat the other side in the cold war to save the free world. Lots of T and A.The cold war is over. The latest one is, once you get through all the plot subterfuges and smoke screens to make you think something to affect the world is going on, is really just a bad ol multinational corporation going through all these terribly dangerous and expensive machinations to get to be the new utilities company for a relatively poor South American country. Huh? All you do is bribe the govt and collect your money. World wide attacks on top intelligence agencies not required. Of course, the producers try to give it the obligatory green twist required in Hollywood today that Bond is saving the planet somehow (here groundwater), but, really, there is just a few 'secret' dams. The water is there, we saw this same 'bad guy' building dams in old west movies about water rights. (The bad guy is starving us poor little honest folks downstream Mr Western hero.) Instead of a the macho free world saving Bond, we have one that is running around being loyal and trying to get revenge for one woman and save his other one (Boss lady M). Put him on a white horse and let him go charge a castle. Big Whoop.Nothing more than a cell phone, diggy camera and internet link are used as his 'edge' in gadgets and technology.Leaving T&A as the only remaining element of the Bond franchise to keep it true to what this whole Bond thing is/was supposed to be about for its fans - and there was none. Literally. 'Marley and Me' designed largely for 10 year olds had more sex and titillation than the friggen Bond film. Seriously.This certainly had a neutered James Bond whose only goal in life was to show two women how special they were. Sex and the City fans would have been proud. Bond fans? Give it a 4 on competent action movie scenes of car chases, boat chases and fist fights to the death. The plot was ridiculous bordering on non-existent. The global threat was a joke. The Bond actor was fine as an action hero/knight on white horse for the ladies in the audience. But, he bore no resemblance to the character that made Bond, Bond.They literally made a Bond film without anything a real fan of Bond films would call a Bond film.The next time you owe your lady a chick flick with hero worried only about saving his lady love, call Bond, James Bond, but frankly, you'd probably enjoy a Sex in the City movie more. At least there will be a little eye candy in those.",1,11,17,19 January 2009
Children of Men," Promises answers, has none
","A movie that promises grandiose answers to society's survivals pressing questions.It never quite articulates what questions, and provides no answers except that what we are doing, in-fighting and violence, is wrong. Duh. We need a movie to take two hours to tell us that in neither an original, enlightening nor particular entertaining form?This movie, in its cinematic story line is nothing but a chase movie with no answers. 'Look, things are bad'. And, 'you can't trust people'. Yeah.Either don't promote it as a movie with answers, or provide some that people didn't learn in the first grade. 'We really need to start playing nice' is a very unsatisfying message to sit through 2 hours of a movie to get.",4,2,6,21 January 2007
Fast Five," A fun popcorn movie that is full of improbable
","I watched Thor last weekend. A comic book movie with other universes, and I think there are more plot devices in Fast Five that requires the audience to suspend logic than there are in Thor! Not trying to do a spoiler post here, so I won't go in to them. Its the kind of big action, big Ka-pow movie that the audience doesn't want to get bogged down in the details on if they just want to have fun. (Where's all the money for stuff coming from, how'd that car do that, federal agents really have that on their computers, very rich criminals would really do that?) Ha. Don't sweat the details and its a good movie to romp around with.",7,0,1,16 May 2011
Alien: Covenant," Wanted to leave early and often, should have
","First huge problem with this film. Virtually none of the characters are the least bit likable. They also react and make decisions not like the well trained crew of a huge, expensive space ship with 2000 people they are responsible for. No, they react cowardly, weakly, with histrionics and with such poor judgment the viewers are soon rooting for the Aliens to dispatch them faster to put them, and the audience out of its misery.The big ending is telegraphed long before it arrives.Without spoilers, I can't mention some of the other failings of this movie, suffice it to say that I have never had the urge to walk out of science fiction movie, but the urge started in this one about 20 minutes in, occurred repeatedly and had I not been with a date, I would have happily left this mess of a movie.",1,18,34,23 June 2017
