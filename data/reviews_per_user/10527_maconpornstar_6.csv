The Blair Witch Project," Boring!
","I am not sure why so many people are obsessed with this movie.  The only thing positive I can say about it is that it is original.  I found the movie boring and uninteresting.  I think one reason this movie was such a flop to me was it's billing.  When I first heard of the movie I thought it was real and was extremely interested in watching it.  Then I found out it was fake and I it lost a lot of its appeal.  Then the commercials for it are great, very mysterious.  I guess I was expecting to much out of it making it easy for it to let me down.",Null,0,1,27 October 1999
Spice World," Oh Come on,
",This was a good movie.  How could you not like a movie where the stars are making fun of themselves.  This movie had me laughing the whole time.  The movie had definite high points and was a good break from the usual films. Again my point is they made fun of themselves and had fun doing it.  How can you not like that.,Null,4,6,28 October 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Loved it!
","This is a great movie for anyone to see.  It does lack originality but in this age where mainstream rules who am I  to talk.  It is a good, fun, light movie.  The movie had many high points which I unfortunately can not mention.  This movie is a must see and well worth the price of a rental. ($3.50 for two nights here.)",10,0,0,27 October 1999
Grease," I have to
","Sorry, but I have to be partial on this movie.  I was named after the lead character.  My mother was a huge John Travolta fan and my father a huge Olivia Newton John fan.  Then of course I had to be born in 1979.  All that aside I love this movie.  It has been a big part of my life growing up. The music is great.  I love all the actors in it, besides Olivia and John.  One of my favorite actresses is Stockard Channing.",10,0,1,27 October 1999
American Beauty," I liked it!
",I liked this movie.  I found it very interesting and it held my attention throughout.  I found the character of Jane to be particularly interesting. She seemed real and I felt I could relate to her.  I would recommend anyone to go see this movie who is of age.  I think the content is a little much for children or childish people for that matter.,10,0,0,27 October 1999
The Matrix," WHOA!!
","This is by far my favorite movie of the year.  I have seen it six times (twice in the theater) and it got better each time.  One thing that makes this movie so great is it appeals to people on every level.  It has the themes of love, action, and science fiction.  It is also great to watch for the cinematic reasons.  My brother-in-law did not understand the movie but he loved it just for the action sequences.  My sister enjoyed seeing Keanu Reeves .",Null,0,0,27 October 1999
