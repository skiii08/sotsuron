Frost_Nixon," Not what I was hoping for
","Frank Langella was brilliant as Nixon and manages to give you a small insight into Nixon, the man, as much as Nixon the president. For me that was the high point of the film. David Frost was shown as a playboy and an inept interviewer which I don't believe he ever was. I think was done to 'meat out' the film a little, to give it more of a story, which is a shame. Micheal sheen, had a hard job playing David Frost because there was a real danger of slipping into a 'Hello, Good evening and Welcome' caricature of Mr Frost which he just manages to steer clear of.For me as a Brit, the film never worked, American viewers will look at it differently perhaps. I can't see how you can't base a whole film on one scene, which is what this film is about. As a stage play I expect it was brilliant but as a film....no.",5,9,19,9 January 2009
The Soloist," Not for us!
","Dire!. Not a film that worked for me or the friends I sat and watched it with. The story was too thin, poorly scripted and in my opinion poorly directed. One of it's many sins was the scene which involved a kaleidescope of colours which changed and kept in sync with the music which was playing in the background?. I am amazed anyone thought that scene would be visually entertaining or that it would 'add' something to the film. The mental heath issues suffered by main character was drawn out and constantly revisited. Once you've established his state of mind I see little reason to keep banging on about it. The film also failed to tell us enough about the main characters for us to get drawn in, by the and of the film I felt little sympathy for them and was pleased it was over.",3,6,12,3 August 2009
