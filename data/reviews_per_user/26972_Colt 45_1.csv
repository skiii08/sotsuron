Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than Episode 4,5&6...it sticks in your head
","I was lucky enough to see this movie the night before it was released (shh...don't tell Mr.Lucas!!!),and I must say it was great. As you see the now-famous Star Wars beginning with the quick summary,titled Episode 1: The Phantom Menace,I had a happy little grin on my face.I won't talk much about the plot,but I do want to say one thing:I believe that Darth Maul, though he doesn't even have two lines of dialogue in the whole movie,is the most entertaining character in the whole movie.Why?Go to the movie and see for yourself as Darth Maul fights the two master Jedis at once.It's what George Lucas meant it to be:a space opera.This is not a movie to see on video,it must be seen on the big screen. Enjoy",10,0,2,19 May 1999
