Ghost," Best film ever!
",This film was the best ever being made for early 90s. Great casting! Soundtrack! Those give low ratings they don't know about films! I was 13 when this film was in cinema. Was the same time as Pretty Woman. Worth to watch it as nowadays they don't do good films anymore. Should won more Oscars! I can watch over and over unlikely some film when you watched the once is enough. I am 43 now still love watch it over and over. Few films you can do this. Make please more films like this one!,10,0,0,26 May 2020
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Wow!
",Great movie but not like the end! I would like to see the voting for the final even if they didn't win! Was a film about Eurovision should make it more like a Eurovision Song Contest! But I really enjoyed it! We missed it this year and they should give us something for that! They should make it over two hours and as I said would like see a voting! Maybe they we see sequel! Worth to watch it!,10,2,7,27 June 2020
