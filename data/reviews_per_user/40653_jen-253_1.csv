50 First Dates," Worst movie I've ever seen.
","This movie is the theatrical equivalent of Chinese water torture - slow, tedious, annoying, painful. The plot consists of a tragic and utterly depressing backstory that's dressed up as a candy-coated romantic comedy. The characters consist of what I guess are supposed to be wacky and hilarious people and sea animals, but the lines are poorly timed and/or written and the personalities so far-fetched that they are completely shallow and unrelatable. Rob Schneider should be a spokesman for an environmental activism group, because he is the king of recycling. The jokes consist mainly of walrus penises and other toilet humor. You know the writing is bad when they bring in animals as actual characters. Don't waste your time and money, do something more exciting like sort your loose change in to piles ordered by the date they were minted.",1,10,29,6 July 2004
