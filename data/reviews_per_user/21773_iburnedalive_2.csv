Hereditary," I had such high hopes
","I had such high hopes for this film after the first five minutes. The whole first half of the movie is shot is such a creepy, beautiful, foreshadowing way..the art of it was just fantastic!But then, it settled off into another run of the mill horror flick with none of that cool art spirit it started with.6 stars instead of 5 because the end had some really fun, nasty visuals but overall, the story was uninteresting. I wish it had delved deeper into the Paimon history/story.",6,2,4,12 September 2019
Taxi Driver," Unpopular Opinion
","Upon first viewing, I am terribly confused as to why this movie is touted as one of the all time greats.There's two cool things about this movie, how Travis looks when he has the mohawk and aviators and one of the end shots from above of the bodies and cops (it was like the original 'mannequin challenge.')I only watched it all the way through because of all the great reviews but I'm highly disappointed.Anyways, this is one man's opinion, we all have them I guess.",1,6,16,10 September 2019
