Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Now that's more like it
","I frankly didn't like 'Vol.1' that much because it border lined on an average, although banal script and because of the amount of overdoing it with those chopped hands and feet in the end. But 'Vol. 2' is sooooo much better. Gone is the uncomfortable and unconvincing feeling of watching a Tarantino movie (because let's face the truth - that's what it is and that's why we're there watching it) and in come those magnificent (Oscar worthy even) monologues and the true feeling of spoofing old Asian martial arts movies. Also the antagonist characters are much much more interesting and believable to watch. But most important of all, the humor is back on track and the acting is all together quite excellent. David Carradine's character of Bill would make every girl's panties wet in a flash in real life because everything he says sounds just so unbelievably interesting and true. I'd want to go and fight him in that beautiful moonlight down on that sandy beach because his gentle words were that convincing. Amazing job quite frankly. Michael Parks as Esteban Vihaio is another great example of a supporting role, as well as comedic talent. His lines are drop dead funny.So the comparison to 'Vol. 1' is quite unnecessary. The first one simply laid the tracks, even if in a rather mediocre way. The second one has everything else. Truly brilliant monologues (Superman's perception on humanity being my favorite), great sense of humor, quite astonishing performances (Uma plays the part with style) and loads of fun.8/10",8,0,1,12 September 2004
Howl's Moving Castle," Beautifully rich with imagination
","I was never a big fan of anime cartoons, to me they seemed very two-sided. On one side you have incredibly fluent and perfectly drawn mind-boggling details, which are mainly used in action scenes, and on the other side you have those crude repetitive monotonous moments of people walking, opening their mouths or just chunks of hair dangling in the wind's breeze where it almost feels as if the animation department is rushing and simplifying their job. 'Hauru No Ugoku Shiro' starts exactly like the latter and I jumped to a conclusion way too soon. Because what I was about to see was nothing less than magic. I forgot the last time a movie captivated me so strongly, the last time I truly felt that kid I once used to be-this movie delivered big -time. Such creativity and pure fantasy extravaganza is almost unheard of today, yet Hayao Miyazaki lets us indulge in it with such ease and simplistic honesty it feels as if he's the only person in the world with imagination worth mentioning. And his definitely is! A colorful palette of characters and a beautiful story are the key element why this movie is worth seeing. Recommendations: anyone who misses feeling like the child they were, people who miss creative movies.9/10",9,2,3,14 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," My expectations were too high
","I can't remember the last time I had such anticipation for something, the closest that I can describe it was when I was 12 years old, all pumped up and waiting for the Ninja turtles movie to come to the cinema. I've been a great fan of Sacha Baron's crazy comedy and especially Borat. I've watched the two Borat trailers over and over and over again like a madman, laughing just as much and pushing the bar of expectations higher and higher each time. Then I saw the IMDb rating and knew it was a done deal-I was going to p*ss my pants watching a movie in the cinema...I am deeply saddened that this was definitely not the case:( I will not go into details, because frankly, it pains me I didn't like this movie as much as I'd hoped. It pains me I actually dozed off for a couple of minuted towards the end, that's how unamused I was. I don't know what happened, all I know is that I will reduce my cinema visits even further.I'd like to finish off by saying that I truly hope Sacha makes more Borat clips and unforgettable comic moments, I don't want it to end on a low note.",6,3,8,5 November 2006
Alien 3," Very, very bad special effects
","The main reason why this movie sucked were the so called 'special effects', which are so bad that the movie would be better off without them. Believe me, even without the alien creature this movie would be more believable. But the story's OK. It's dark and depressive but if you liked the first two you should be able to watch this one. When I first saw it I thought it was terrible, but later on I got to appreciate the movie as a whole, without the lame special effects of course, but it's still far from its predecessors.A nice prison movie though.      6/10",7,4,6,14 March 2002
The Ring," Very scary and very confusing
","I haven't been this scared for a long time and 'The Ring' proved to be a great thrill ride. With a great lead by the extremely sexy Naomi Watts and a bundle of great supporting acting, a score that fit the mood perfectly(Zimmer who else) and great visual style and special effects this movie is not to be missed. But the plot was too much for me, I still don't understand half of it. Who made the tape(some say it was that girl), why make it(because she wanted to be noticed?), what, why, where.....AAAAAARRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHH I watched 'The Ring' at a friends house, on his computer(which is always the worst possible way to watch horror movies), but the quality was excellent and he adjusted the volume to the max. What a ride.8/10",8,0,0,11 April 2003
Casablanca," What is it about this movie??????
","I found 'Casablanca' to be pretty unentertaining, funny at moments(sometimes unintentionally), but not worthy of being called a movie classic. Hell no! It's just another movie where Bogart is trying to look like he's to cool for school, and Bergman isn't anything special either. The best moments come from Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault and the best acting is played out by Paul Henreid. However, the story's what really sucks here. If that's really how people used to live half a century ago, then thank god for the 60's and the 70's. And if I'm is supposed to believe that in real life the love triangle would unfold as it does on the big screen or that Bergman just goes along with Bogart's last minute decision that she's in love with Victor Lazslo after all, leaving Bogie, the love of her life behind, well, then I'm offended. If that young couple just needed money to buy their way out of Casablanca, then why the hell didn't Bogart do the same. He was loaded. We're supposed to believe his character's background of being so terribly in love, experiencing a loss of that love, an over acted performance of going through pain when he rediscovers that love, yet in the final scene he doesn't show any sign of true heart break or any kind of pain. He decides he's going to cling to the past and let the love of his life, the only woman he ever loved and will ever love fly away forever. Pretty cheesy. But with some good one liners.     7/10",6,4,15,15 November 2002
Training Day," Auuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
","I can't stop thinking about this movie. Yesterday evening I rushed to the cinema because something told me I just had to see it. Whatever it was, I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL!!!!!! I was blown away in the first few minutes. Denzel Washington' performance left me speechless and a day later I still can't find the right words to use. It was as if he'd been preparing his whole life for this role, building and forming it inside his mind but in the mean time also delivering some of the better performances seen on the big screen like the one in 'Crimson Tide' or 'Devil in a blue dress'... I think a Slovene critic said it best; The role of Alonzo Harris is Denzel's 'Scarface', it's a role, a character, a movie that breaths in the beat of his heart and it's a role that represents a peak in his career.
A movie that never ceases to amaze took me for an unforgettable ride making sure that I will never look at Mr. Washington the same again. When his name is going to be mentioned this is the role I will think of first. Kudos to Ethan Hawke as well who represented another major surprise of the movie proving that he is a good actor and that he could easily follow the tempo of his 'partner in crime'. With the amazing performances by the two actors, a story that kept me begging for more and a bunch of memorable supporting roles (Scott Glen, the surprisingly great Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Macy Gray)and a great sound track this is without a doubt the best 2001 had to offer.Denzel winning his well deserved Oscar (although Russel Crowe's performance was almost equally good) proved to be merely icing on a cake that was already amazing.     My ni**a!        10/10",9,3,14,2 April 2002
Wayne's World," One of the most hilarious movie ever
","If you like comedies, this movie is a must see. The humor might not appeal to everybody, but who cares. I think it's brilliant. And I always knew Mike Myers would become successful, because his humor is new and not cliche. And Dana Carvey is funny as well. One of those movies you can watch again and again and they will never become boring.   9/10",9,0,2,11 February 2002
The Big Lebowski," Great funny movie
","I have taken quite a liking towards the Coen brothers. I never really appreciated their work since until recently when I saw both 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' and 'The Big Lebowski', both very funny and abundantly entertaining movies. The best thing about both these movies was that I watched them each in small bits, every time for about 20-25 minutes. And when I started watching where I left off it was if as I had been watching the movie in one take, there was no 'khmm, I better rewind a couple of minutes back to remember what happened'. They were both highly enjoyable movies to watch because of their simplicity in storytelling. And although simple, the stories are always rich in detail and the two brothers are on hell of a storyteller. I have always loved the movie directors that use the same actors over and over again and then make jokes about this in their movies (the main reason I dig some Kevin Smith movies) and the Coens have a blast out of this as well. It's a homely feeling for the viewer I guess, a sort of subconscious participation and understanding of these jokes, which I find great. The feeling of 'The Big Lebowski' is very easygoing, just as our protagonist. A great sense of musical accompaniment, great acting by each and every actor and a great sense of directing are all wonderfully presented. Plus there are many laugh out loud scenes that are truly hilarious (the scene where the character of Jesus (a roughly 3 minute Oscar-worthy performance by Turturo) is presented). Oh yeah, and a hell of a script. Simple and loads of fun.7/10",8,0,3,9 September 2004
As Good as It Gets," Wonderful
","Now I know what good acting means. You are absolutely surrounded with it in this movie. There is not a single actor or actress in this movie that didn't exceed himself/herself. Helen Hunt is great (I don;t know why, but I find her quite attractive) and I won't bore you about the performance given by Jack Nicholson. When I first saw this movie I thought it was really boring and overrated, but I saw it again the second day and immediately loved it. Maybe the ending is a little bogus, but it's a romantic comedy, so it didn't bother me that much. A fairly complicated plot presented with ease and simplicity works perfectly and there's a nostalgic tone to the movie in whole. Maybe because it's a rare occasion nowadays to come across a movie that isn't stuffed with special effects. This is a movie that should be seen on a beautiful day, when you're in a good mood. Great fun that keeps getting better and better each time I see it.  A strong 8/10.",8,32,45,16 March 2002
Mississippi Burning," Powerful piece of cinema
","I cannot pretend I can even slightly understand how African Americans must have felt (and sadly still feel) during such oppressions but I can only say how deeply I am disturbed at how utterly disgusting, pathetic, idiotic and unbelievably horrible 'white' 'men' and 'women' were(and sadly still are). 'Mississippi Burning' tries to show us a part of such sad times when black(I apologize for the primitive term) people were treated with immense hatred and differences. Gene Hackman in one of his better roles and Willem  Dafoe doubly so try to uncover the mystery behind a murder of three activists and as they go along they realize that a big part of the town shares its views with the KKK, especially the people in high places. Understanding the hatred of these primitive people is truly beyond me and if there's one thing this movie does is show how terribly limited and stupid they are. Great directing, great performances all around and a terrible feeling of sadness and joy in the end.8/10",8,1,2,6 September 2003
Beauty and the Beast," Touching and well made
","I saw this movie in the theater twice in the same day and I loved it. I was much younger (about10), but even now I still like it. Disney's magical movies are never boring and are mostly quality work. And they always make the female characters so attractive. Very nice. Anyway, a nice movie, it's not Disney's finest, but well worth the watch.  7/10",7,2,5,6 March 2002
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Fun for the whole family
","Yeah right!:)So I finally got to see the 'South Park' movie. It's nothing special but it makes its point. It's a world-class parody Mel Brooks wouldn't mind bringing to life, only it's intended for adults only(at least I presume). It's filled with sing-along songs, constantly making fun of the Disney legacy of musicals, but the songs are smart and witty as well.The funniest part of the movie simply has to be the whole German scheisse video scene which made me laugh so hard I almost dropped the glass I was holding in my hand.Not quite as funny as I'd hoped it would be, but still a decent movie. 7/10",7,2,2,6 March 2003
Oldboy," I couldn't believe my eyes, nor ears for that matter
","That's how big an impact 'Oldboy' made on me! The opening of the movie alone is perhaps the coolest opening I have ever seen because when that music started playing and the first scene starts rolling I was in movie heaven. It was one of those perfect moments I guess, and it was all the much harder to believe, because I am no Asian-movie fan. Actually I avoid Asian movies as much as I can because I don't like their storytelling and directing, plus I never remember the faces because they all look the same. I have, since seeing 'Oldboy', changed my opinion on that. How could I not, the movie has more style that the first two Matrix movies combined, visual effects that are more than equal rivals to any big-budget Hollywood movie, actors that I was somehow able to recognize were amazing, despite having to read the subtitles all the way through, and a music score that has been playing in my head for many days now. And I haven't even gotten to the true core of this movie. It's a story that blew me away, it's a hardcore revenge movie that won't leave you cold. Put all of this into exactly two hours of pure entertainment at it best, countless memorable scenes that are beyond amazing, and give it a dash of perfection. You got it, an instant cult classic. 9/10",9,44,151,26 August 2004
Spider-Man 2," Thank God
","'Spider-man 2' is the movie the first 'Spider-man' should have been. Effort has been put into correcting the mistakes from the first one, and it shows all around. For starters, the visual effects have at last become great to look at, there are still some bad moments though, but at least Spidey swinging in the air seems real this time around. Everybody except Tobey does a wonderful job, Alfred Molina and Kirsten Dunst deserve special kudos here. The first is a great villain, showing a rainbow of emotions and making his character as believable as humanly possible and Dunst, whom I never liked, grew on me, like fungi on stale bread. She saved scenes where the script was corny and considering she had to react accordingly to the vegetable that is Tobey Maguire, she was great and played her character perfectly. Tobey himself is still the same lame-ass actor, looking more retarded than not, unable to show a facial expression without looking ridiculous, and he is one lucky s.o.b. for having others saving his terribly ineffective performance. The guy just isn't Peter Parker/Spider-man, he is physically just a weird looking guy that has a weird (bad) way of acting and just didn't understand what he had to do to get into the character. He doesn't seem to be having any fun at all with his performance. Yet strangely the movie works out fine, without any real damage. Besies also having some weird editing there is of course the fact that the movie has many truly ridiculous moments when our friendly neighborhood falls from 100+ feet to the ground about three times during the movie, just stands up and goes about his business. Spider-man as a superhero is also an incredibly careless and hypocritical guy, on one side denying his love for MJ for the sake of keeping her safe if his enemies discovered his true identity, and on the other taking his mask off like he just din't give a damn if somebody saw him. But in the end everything falls into place incredibly well, nothing feels rushed and the movie ends on a truly high note. With Danny Elfman's music also used much more effectively than in the original I finally had the feeling I was watching a superhero movie. Many great scenes, mostly great acting and effects, and a solid superhero story, I feel I've become a light-weight fan of the series.",7,1,3,4 February 2006
Finding Nemo," A let down
","I just have to mention this first to anyone who's about to read this comment - I am not reviewing 'finding Nemo' just as a movie for children, but as an adult who loves Pixar's animated movies and knows that other adults love them too. So, let me start by saying this is the 1st Pixar movie that I wasn't impressed with, and I actually never thought this could happen. So far their movies have been simply amazing and breathtaking, and the animation in 'Finding Nemo' never ever embarrasses this statement. There were however a couple of problems that I simply couldn't forget.-the character of Marlin. He's just to obnoxious and mistrusting to be anywhere near likable, let alone the quiet 'hero' of the movie. I was sure that sooner or later he'd realize that he just has to loosen up and trust people, but he sadly never does. Even in the last scene where Nemo tries to save those fish he does't let him at first. and I know that he's just being protective and all, but isn't that just the whole point of the story, put in words by Crush the turtle; 'You don't really know? Like when they know you'll know, ya know?'. Him being over protective is just stupid but he never realizes his mistakes, which is the biggest reason why this movie blows. It just doesn't make sense - throughout the whole movie he just bitches about stuff that Dory suggests and even after realizing on many occasions that she was right he doesn't learn. -Pixar is much more that this movie. Had they been their usual self they would have made it into one of the best movies of all time. I'm not kidding, throughout the whole movie I expected and guessed how the characters were going to evolve and roughly what was going to happen, but hardly anything if it did, which was a shame because I came up with some great stuff in my mind. I should have written about it immediately after the movie because I forgot most of it. Most importantly, they should have changed the scene where Bruce chases Marlin and Dory. Why you ask? I'll tell you why. It's because of a certain movie called 'Jaws'. And to make a counter effect Pixar could do some good by not portraying every single shark as a vicious killer. Granted Bruce & co have the vegetarian thing going on, but after smelling blood he turns into the usual killing machine and it just ruins the whole concept. The scene should have looked something like this. After smelling the blood, getting his killer eyes and his killer cravings back he should have said, in a controlled, yet tempted fashion, something like: 'daaaarn mate , your AB- sure gives me the munchies!' Then. for a moment, he'd be very very tempted and start munching his mouth. And then Dori'd see what he's thinking and she'd smack him on his nose so he'd just kind of snap out of it, first excusing himself, but then saying 'Hey Dori, you wouldn't mind doing me a small favor, would you?' Dori: 'Sure:). Just name it' Fade to black for half a second. We see them both moving slowly in circle, Bruce just behind her, with a kind of hypnotized and silly goofy-happy look on his face, kind of praying, yet knowing that he must not hurt her(a kind of therapy if you will). And Dori is all worked up and having fun because she's leading him around in circles as if he was hunting her, but knowing very well that he just needs to work on his veggy thing some more. And that's how you do it!-next, what on earth were the writers thinking when they just left the tank fish to save themselves. It had to be the saddest and most shocking thing in the whole movie for me because it was so mean of Nemo & co to forget his buddies. Pixar really should have though this one through. They could have made a movie that was environmentally (even politically!!!)conscious, be a breakthrough movie where sharks weren't killers first, friends later, showed how animals are easily mistreated by humans(OK, they actually have this one), show how parents can be overprotective and not realize when their children should have the right to make their own decision, show how children shouldn't disobey parents too often, just about anything they could think of. The saddest part is that they have every single thing I just wrote in the movie, they just don't use them to their fullest potential or miss them completely.Otherwise a fairly decent movie that probably looked amazing in the cinema. 7/10",7,0,2,21 July 2004
The Others," Surprisingly good
","I was very skeptical about this one. The trailer looked like this was another boring movie the likes of 'The Haunting', and boy did I not want to see something like that again. But somehow my friend convinced me to go see it and I'm really glad I did.It was the perfect movie for a rainy Friday night in April.To begin with, this movie probably contains the best performance delivered by Nicole Kidman. She is very believable and was a perfect choice. The two young actors were even better. Is it these magical and brilliant thrillers('Sixth sense', 'Unbreakable') that bring the best out of children actors, or is it just my imagination. Anyway, a brilliant movie that can easily be compared to Shyamalan's 'Sixth sense', especially the ending part, but in my opinion a very different movie. I consider the comparison to be flattering, since 'Sixth sense' is well, an amazing and unprecedented movie experience, and 'The others' produces a similar atmosphere, but it ends there. This movie takes its own path, and it does so very successfully. To make a horror movie without any blood, simply by playing with sound and light is extraordinary, and I realized it only after I read a review by a great Slovene film critic. Great, great acting, a thrilling and exciting story and of course a brilliant ending make this one of the best movie of 2001 and Alejandro Amenábar passed his first Hollywood movie making experience with flying colors. Almost.       8/10",8,0,2,27 April 2002
Troy," No theme?
","If I were given the chance to change a single thing in this movie it would be firing James Horner. As if his reputation had no base. Where is the unwritten rule of all great movie scores, especially the ones from movies of such magnitude - you gotta have a theme brother. Where's the theme in 'Troy', where's the feeling that something either epic and heroic or evil and malicious is happening on the screen. All we are treated with are female vocals that sound strangely familiar-oh wait, could it be similar to the great score from 'Gladiator'. 'Troy' doesn't hide similarities with the latter, sadly they only make it look cheaper and without its own soul, but still, if they copied elements why not copy them right. In this aspect 'Troy' is very much inferior to Scott's Oscar winner, it lacks in the actor's performances(only the two kings show the stuff that great actors are made of-kudos to Peter O'Toole and especially especially to Brian Cox who singlehandedly made every other actor in his scenes look like a good one, decent at the least), visual effects, cinematography, the works. It has nothing going for it that will satisfy a movie freak like me. Sure, those 3 hours went by pretty quickly, and Orlando Bloom even showed some hints of acting in him(the boy is truly awful in his scenes with Helena), Brad Pitt managed to make his hair color look authentic for a while, and Eric Bana didn't sound and feel like a Russel Crowe imitator all of the time, but the feeling that 'Troy' could have been one of the better movies of 2004 remains-sadly! Need I start mentioning the book this movie is based on. 6/10",6,1,5,24 May 2004
Dead Poets Society," !!!CARPE DIEM INDEED!!!
",I will make this very short since I always find it difficult to put into words(in this case writing) when I encounter a wonderful experience. 'Dead Poets Society' is the biggest inspiration I ever saw put on film and I couldn't have seen it at a better time because I am exactly at this point in my life. I am becoming the master of my destiny and this movie made me believe in my path even more. Robin William's performance of a lifetime and the rest of the cast is just as superb!!!

Insomnia," If there's a good European movie made, an American version will follow shortly
","I think most movie remakes are totally unnecessary because 1) they either show nobody came up with a good story and therefore just took the easy way out by recycling an old one, 2) some director thought he could surpass the original and almost surely failed to do so, or 3)the movie's foreign and American's don't like that If you think number 3) isn't true, just think about it for a second. If there's a demand for something, then somebody usually wants That something. Was there ever a time I read an article on our beloved IMDb with a title like: 'US cinema's can't wait for the next Almodovar picture to be screened'. Now movie remakes derive from the US, by not even checking somewhere if this is true I know it is, without a doubt, a fact. There are nations (I know of bigger European ones, like Germany, France, Spain, Italy), that for generations have been borough up by watching every single possible thing on TV dubbed into their language. Be it 'The Simpsons' or 'Casablanca', they put huge amounts of money into the industry of dubbing and the end result is these nations have poor knowledge of other languages. Except for Germans, who luckily share a language similar to the English language, this is a fact. American't take a different approach, they brand the stuff their way, ALL the way. Big bucks are put into making a movie that's already been done. All this because in the end, they were borough up by watching only American stuff, and because Hollywood likes to earn something as well.It's actually funny and disturbing at the same time thinking just how racist this discussion could become, if pursued on. But this is not my point at all, amidst the almost accusative comments I've made thus far I've almost lost hold of it. In short, if there's a good European movie made, an American version will follow. This is sad enough as it is. What's even sadder is that this is happening faster and faster. It's almost a crime, the makers of the original get some Hollywood money for the rights to the movie, and the price they pay is much greater. Instead of them taking credit for a well done movie, the Hollywood machine does.Why Chris Nolan decided to make a remake is beyond me. After a story like 'Memento'!!! There is nothing bad that can be said about his version apart from it being a remake. Which is more than enough. The only bright side of remakes, and you can quote me on this, is they make you discover good originals.",6,1,2,8 February 2006
We Were Soldiers," Decent
","I didn't expect much from 'We Were Soldiers' since it was made at a time when Hollywood was encouraged to promote the US army(post 11.9). American patriotism is noticeable but they don't push it too far. A nice surprise which is sadly not exploited enough since it brings balance to all that Americana is that we get to see the other side, the Vietnamese commanders, planning and thinking how to defeat the American invaders, so this is not one of those 'kill the f....ng useless yellowskins' type of movies.It tries to be as partial as possible and for the most parts succeeds. The problem is the acting. It doesn't stand out, no particularly good performances, which is about the only big downside since the movie could really use a more personal and dramatic touch. There are maybe just one to many characters in here to fully explore them. But considering that most of the time everyone is fighting for their lives I can understand this.Instead the movie really comes through in the effects department, displaying some truly spectacular visual effects and makeup(the scene where Joe Galloway picks up the burnt soldier by the legs is one of the most disgusting and disturbing things I have ever seen).The end result is a solid war movie taking place in an abnormally unrealistic 'Vietnamese' surrounding that simply doesn't have anything new to tell, quite the opposite, it becomes a victim of a recycled formula from which we, the viewers, know exactly what to expect and therefore 'We Were Soldiers' never really stood a chance at anything, even the American box office. 7/10",6,0,1,30 June 2003
Crash," A thought provoking social study
","Brilliant! That's what 'Crash' is. A brilliant roller-coaster of stirred, sometimes hidden and unknown emotions, but you can't be unaffected by the ride. This movie almost screams about a subject that everybody in the developed world is very aware of, yet there hasn't been a movie made about it in this way. Everybody is the good guy(strictly no pun intended), all of these everybody's are also the bag guys, but what 'Crash' wants to show us is the shift between these two states in each of these people. It succeeds with flying colors. This is a goose-bump movie and I was consuming the screen with my eyes like it was the last movie I was ever going to see. Very precisely and tactfully paced, 'Crash' knows when and why to show something-no screen time is wasted for making moments appear more (or less for that matter) than they are. Paul Haggis, the director, also had a very clear vision of why hiring known, even super-star actors/actresses was going to pay off. He succeeded something remarkable, not one! of these names stands out in the movie as the predominant one, quite the contrary, its the events around them that take that place. You can be a somebody, you can be a nobody, it doesn't matter much really. Either way you can get stopped by cops, robbed, shot at or even get killed.An unforgettable and unrepeatable script, ensemble of actors and a long list of scenes, perfect directing and great music to bring the unspoken to the screen - 'Crash' is the reason why movies of this quality don't get Oscars-because we know better!A movie that shows a so-called rookie director can easily make Hollywood hide in a deep and isolated cave of shame until another Ron Howard eye-tearing drama comes along.9/10 - Recomendations: Absolutely everybody, especially the confused, the oppressed, the hated, the unnoticed, all of you will find a piece of comfort, I promise",9,1,6,14 November 2005
Blade II," Blah
","My all-time favorite comic book hero is Batman. Why; because he's dark, cool and constantly has battles with his almost double personality. Blade is in (pretty close) second spot. Why; the same reasons! Love Burton's style, hate (maybe that's a too strong word for 'Batman Forever')Schumacher's. From ultra dark to super silly just is just too much Love Norrington's style and approach. Despise del Toro's.When somebody sets out to make a sequel they want to make it better than the first one. Better is not more! Quantity sure as hell ain't quality here. More guys on blade's side this time (a bunch of cool looking characters that don't get nearly enough screen time for the viewer to feel any emotion for them), more cool action(which in some cases doesn't really serve the story at all), more effects(some pretty good, but the CG Blade looks unrealistic and just plain bad). Plus he jumps all around the place like a monkey on speed, sadly making the movie loose any credibility it was left with after the opening sequence.Did del Toro even take the time to watch 'Blade'. An opening scene that has gained an almost legendary and infamous reputation, a scene which will go down as one of the coolest club dance scenes ever is more than enough a reason to make the opener in the second installment at least half as good. Nope, not even a glimpse of effort. As if del Toro intentionally wanted to do this, I just have a feeling he managed to make a big F..K YOU to all 'Blade' lovers and threw together a movie that does nothing but the worst with the material. The cinematography (compared to the first Blade) is worth dick and they could barely find some decent electronic tunes to go along. It's pretty hard to find anything better in this sequel except for some really R rated violence scenes and some really funny scenes between Blade and Reinhardt.An adrenaline-pumped hyperactive movie that doesn't take time to stop and think but instead just keeps going into the wrong direction from the very start. And I'm not talking plot-wise at all, but going from the very cool and smart Blade from the first movie to the cliche filled movie (the first action scene where he almost crashes into his car(which is hardly used in the movie anyway) and then gives it a kiss)with a jumping maniac that should at least have done it with the female vampire.
A bad choice for a director whom I respect for making the choice to take a completely different approach but also despise for failing miserably.The Blade franchise stands on a limb.  6/10",6,0,2,24 July 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Pixar has done it again
","This movie lived up to its expectations. With great ease, I might add. It is slightly different from previous Pixar movies, the fact that it wasn't directed by John Lasseter might have something to do with it:), because I felt that there was less of that universal humor that anyone, be it a 5 year old child or an adult can find funny. But the lack of humor was replaced with a truly touching story and one of the best movie climaxes I have seen in a long time. I also thought that the very, very ending of the movie is nothing less than perfect and I left the cinema with a desire to see the movie again. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were great choices for the main characters, but they could have done more with Steve Buscemi's character, if for anything because he has a very distinctive and likable voice. A great story, nice characters and THE perfect ending make 'Monsters, Inc' a great movie experience.         Can't wait for the next one.                 9/10",9,1,2,5 May 2002
Predator," One of the best movies about survival
","This is one of the best if not the best (right next to 'Escape from Absolom') exsistencialistic (is this a word?) movies ever made. The story is simple and effective. No stupid dialogue, no 'deeper' meanings, nothing but the bare necessities. Arnie is great, as well as Carl Weathers, who should have starred in more movies. For some reason I find the scene where the alien blows off his arm very memorable. Well, anyway, the climax between man and alien is satisfactory and delivers the 'goods'. Probably Mctiernan's finest work. Very bloody, very entertaining, very memorable and a true classic. Brilliant.        9/10",8,0,0,1 March 2002
The Bourne Identity," Did the director have a stroke of amnesia
","!!!WARNING: SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!What the hell happened with this movie. The first part was literally breathtaking due to the suspence, amazing action sequences and cool music and I found myself thinking that this might actually be a cool movie. But as soon as Bourne reads that newspaper and puts all the missing pieces together the movie instantly looses its tempo and meaning. After we discover Bourne's identity(coincidentally the title of the movie), well I guess there's just no point in dragging the movie any longer, unless the story had a deeper purpose or meaning. Not in this case though, Bourne decides to singlehandedly challenge the organisation he works for so he can then, after some action scenes of course, leave it on his own terms. Sounds easy?, well they make it look even easier. Oh yeah, and just before the end there's a scene that looks so ridiculously dumb and unbelievable that even Tom Cruise's scenes on the motorcycle in 'MI2' or Pierce Brosnan's leap to catch the falling plane in 'Goldeneye' started looking somewhat credible. It was like the director lost his focus for the 2nd half. The whole background of Bourne's spy organisation is 'explained' in a single line. How or why he became a 30 million dollar government property is sadly never revealed. Nice appearance by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and the sexy Franka Potente though.Good action doesn't make up for a meaningless story. 6/10",7,1,2,19 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A magical tale of extreme proportions
","There truly is no other movie like this. The fantastic epic tale is breaks barriers in many ways and for three hours or so I was really able to live in the world only Tolkien could see and knew existed. The beauty of this film lies not only in the scenic world or the visual effects, but comes to life especially due to the actors who bring a magical and wonderful atmosphere to the movie and thus also bring believability of their roles to the maximum.The scene that I most remember is when the Fellowship arises, because the film makers truly captured the moment. If there is a downside to the movie it's definitely not it's length because the movie never lost its tempo - it's those blasted seats in the cinema that made my but ache and fall asleep. And there's that 'Titanic'-y feel to the score when Frodo and Samwise head off in the canoe. Bhhhhhhhhhh. And the ending, if I can even call it an ending came very suddenly and I left the cinema feeling cheated of the rest of the movie. Oh well, 'The two towers' next year then.8/10",9,0,0,29 March 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," I too, followed the white rabbit into the rabbit hole, but by the time we were more than half way down, he turned around and gazed at me with the weirdest look in his petrified and black little eyes;it was t
","!!!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!The weirdest thing happened while I was in the cinema with my friend. In the scene where Trinity is talking to Neo for the last time people started talking and giggling. More than half the hall I suspect. It was actually quite funny and surreal and I didn't blame them one bit, it actually probably helped us all to get through the 'Revolutions' a bit faster. How the hell did they shift the series from being the don't-make-its-stop-`now` :)  movies to the please-somebody,-make-it-end-before-the-cup-holder-gets-over-filled-with-my -vomit. I'm kidding, it's not that bad, I never ever fill it up the whole way. But the 'Revolutions' still reeks! I briefly read some reviews before seeing it and most of them were negative, which was much better than the opposite because then I'd have bigger expectations which ALMOST always just ruin the movie experience. So bear in mind, I enjoyed the first two movies immensely but I am not a die hard fan of the Matrix nor it's story, the one single thing I was expecting, naturally, was the blaster over-the-top and again incomprehensively unprecedented cinematography and special effects. Naturally. 'Should I stop now, or does this sentence speak for itself. And if it does, would it still have done so had I not mentioned it.' Sound silly, sound confused. Yes, yes, we're learning.
'Forget the rules that apply to the 'Matrix' series, come November they apply no more.' Whoa! 'I'm trying to free your mind, Theo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.' Yeah. Well, that sounds like a pretty good deal. But I think I may have a better one. How about, I give you the finger, and then you give me what I want. ' Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. ' Well, here I am, buster. I saw the first part. I saw 'Reloaded' and the 'Animatrix', what more do you want me to do??? `Stand up and see for yourself.' What? Why? It's not like that's gonna make one hell of a difference. Are you telling me that when I stand up I'll know what I want? That I'll know what you want me to do? `No, Theo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.' English... `Have you ever had a dream, Theo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?Easy, my mom' d wake me up for breakfast. `I know exactly what you mean!' -'The answer is out there, Theo, and it's looking for you, and it will find you if you want it to.'- Who are you? I don't know you!? -'Most guys do.'- ??? What the... -'Please Theo, you have to trust me.'- Why? `-I know why you're here, Theo. I know what you've been doing... why you hardly sleep, why you live alone, and why night after night, you sit by your computer. You're looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It's the question, Theo. It's the question that drives us. It's the question that brought you here. You know the question, just as I did.'-...............! Yes!!! YES!!! I knew it! I knew it all along!. I knew the rumors were true!!! Muahaha. I was right all along!!!I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!!!!!!!!! In your face mom! -'What's he doing?'- `He's beginning to believe.' This is amazing... it's more than amazing....it's phenomenal!!!!!! I finally get to know the answer  to THE question! And to think I almost gave up. OK, OK, guys, so tell me. How DOES Santa Claws manage to bring gifts and presents to every kid in the world in one night? `...??????' -'...!...'-...Come on, tell me!... What?...... Why are you looking at me like that. What'd I do??? Oh don't start with the silent treatment NOW! After all that fancy babble. I WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! `Were you listening to me, Theo?!!!! Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?!!!!' First of all - I was not looking at Santa because he's not even here right now, I think you need to take off those broken-ass shades and No.2  - he aint no woman!, you really should check with your friends on that one. I mean really What's the matter with you guys, first YOU tell me I can get my answers if I just stand up? and then SHE starts talking about my life like she can see through my mind or something, teasing me with YOU KNOW WHO. I'm starting to think you don't want to help me at all. So what's it gonna be? Give me one reason why I should even bother giving you more of my time. ......'You are the One, Theo. You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I have spent my entire life looking for you.' OK....a bit freaky and not very true, but whatever rocks your boat. Go on `You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. Ironically, that's not far from the truth. ` Just show me the damn truth, fruitcake `You've been living in a dream world, Theo. Free your mind.' Okey dokey.. free my mind. Right, no problem, free my mind, free my mind, no problem, right... ........Jesus Why do my eyes hurt? 'Welcome to the real world.'Totally missed the point there. Just like this movie. Those fans searching for answers will be let down immensely, those expecting a fulfilling ending will curse the Wachowski brothers for not at least going for (somebody up there forgive me)your typical Hollywood-ish ending(their anime-ish depressive final showdown between Neo and Smith(even the great Hugo Weaving doesn't seem as brilliant as before)is overblown and disappointing as is the even more depressing and stupid ending where man makes peace with machines and nobody even expects Neo to return(some friends, huh)-they all simultaneously assume and conclude he didn't make it.),  those(me including) expecting your average highly above average and beautiful cinematography and fx will be crying for years to come(sure the fight between robots and humans is great, but certainly not better than the major effects in the first two movies) and those expecting good performances by most of the supporting actors should have known better. Tank and Dozer made sure of that bridge burning in the first one. From the very first Matrix it was always the 'real world' scenes, be it on the Nebuchadnezer or in Zion, that were the worst, they made the first movie not as fantastic as it could have been and they sucked the first half hour of 'Reloaded'. 'Revolutions' is hardly anything else than just this - 85 percent of the movie takes place in the real world. There's a whole different feel to the movie, no beautiful sceneries, no worth-mentioning cinematography that made the biggest impression on me and many others. It was a plain action movie without substance or stlye! DID I SAY THAT? I have to face the truth, this was the 2nd biggest sequel disappointment of my cinematic life. I'm still working on my comment for 'T3'.The Wachowskis failed on every level and people will hate them for that. I hate them for that. I hate them for unintentionally ruining their own movie. Their own. It takes talent to do that. Especially if you spawn a movie such as the brilliant Matrix and then return with a great sequel.The whole cinematic world was expecting the very best from these two, it was going to be the biggest thing in 2003 and the most important trilogy in recent memory(I'm not counting LOTR movies because they're based on books) 'Revolutions' is very unbalanced and has numerous meaningless scenes, like the first half hour(deja vu I guess). And when you want a Matrix movie to end you know something's not right.I predict 'Revolutions' will fail to amount more that 'Reloaded', hell, I think it'll have a hard time breaching the 200 million mark in the USA. The same pattern happened with the 'Back To The Future' series. The first one was an immense hit, an instant cult movie, the second and third were made simultaneously and came to theaters 6 months apart, but because of the not-so-hot response to the second one(because it was reportedly too complicated) the third one (in my mind also the weakest in the series) earned less that it did. The trilogy could have easily been the Star Wars of our generations, but the final part is unforgivingly bad and will be haunting the Wachowskis for a long long time. It just makes me wish they had left the original Matrix movie stand alone. I actually quite like(d) the idea of having the free choice to decide what and how and when and etc. happens to the machines. Having destiny in your own hands, remember. Sad isn't it, they fail at the core of the message that so persistently drove them. It's only now that I realized it. 5/10 DID I WRITE THAT?",5,0,0,20 November 2003
The Thing," Disappointing
","Carpenter actually managed to make his 'The Thing' far inferior to its predecessor , the 1951 'The Thing From Another World'. If you have read my comment on the latter you may know what I'm talking about, but the fact remains that you cannot make this sort of movie based purely on some cheesy monster, it has to be character driven first; that's why 'Predator', the whole 'Alien' franchise and some other monster movies work. And what does 'The Thing' have to offer; well not much; Kurt Russel is his hillbilly self, taking the leader role from the very start and the rest of the cast doesn't amount to much either. The best part of the whole movie is the opener which really got me thinking and hoping what Carpenter had in store, but it just proved to be a disappointment. The movie also excluded some of the best scenes from the original, like showing  the discovery of the space ship. The 1951 movie made that scene very thrilling, showing less than more, making the viewer yearn for a glimpse but never getting one. And don't get me started on the monsters; the comments I read from the IMDb users make you want to think the effects are better and scarier than anything you've ever seen, but the honest to God truth is I'd choose even the original creature from 'Alien' any day. There are just so many things popping and bursting out of those creatures it's hard to swallow, and the head-turn-to-spider scene is a real gem when it comes to idiotic comedy. Plus it shows just how much the special effects creators were influenced by 'Alien' which came out only a couple of years ago; the thing even lived off of the same thing, it needed a host and then it just ate whatever it could find. There were even similarities with the whole blood scene; alien's was acid, this one just lived forever and didn't like fire. I thought Morricone's score was quite good, the whole 5 minutes of it which I'm guessing is one of the reasons it got a Razzie nomination. Ha. Overall, a movie that doesn't pay much tribute to the original, nor does it manage to surpass it, not by a long shot. Not enough atmosphere, a poor script and a bad climax don't amount to much and probably the most inventive and positive thing in this whole mess is the very ending, which reminds us 'The Thing' is definitely a Carpenter movie, sadly just not one of the better ones. 5/10",5,16,40,6 August 2003
Armageddon," A HUGE downfall for Bruckheimer
","After Enemy of the state and this movie I knew the Bruckheimer happy days were over. After The Rock, Crimson Tide, Top Gun, Bad Boys, B. Hills Cop, Days of thunder, Con Air (I consider it as the last of the Great)and many other great movies he sank into a hole he might never climb out of again. What the hell was this crap. I used to love, no, ADORE the beginning of every Bruckheimer/Simpson movie, you know, the camera over an empty road and suddenly lightning strikes, or now when the camera suddenly turns right into a tree,  because it stood for quality action and entertainment in the best possible way. But after the yoakles, who of course have never been to space, but instead know how to drill deep holes into earth (duuh!)an are so chosen instead of the qualified astronauts, save the world, I lost a great deal of faith in the Bruckheimer/ Bay duo. It was completely lost after Pearl Harbor. Man, Michael Bay really took a nasty turn after Bad Boys an The Rock(both excellent , excellent action movies) The only good thing that came from Bruckheimer after that was CSI-not exactly realistic, but hey, there wouldn't be much of a show if they didn't take over every case they came across. But enough about that. This movie was made for 12 year old's and if you don't believe me, well who's stopping you. Go see it, enjoy the almost 2 and a 1/2 hours of pure idiotism and don't forget to cry at the end like you're supposed to. The middle age man sitting next to me did, I kid you not, and he was the most significant reason why I give this movie 5/10. Hey, if Michael Bay can make adult men cry after this movie( which should definitely be considered as a chick flick, the same as the ever so popular Titanic and Pearl Harbor)he really is a genius.",6,0,1,11 February 2002
The Village," James Newton Howard saves the day
","I am kind of baffled by this movie  I have problems describing it!'Unbelievable lack of advertising strategy' would be my first observation. M. Night Shyamalan has made his career with suspenseful thrillers with plot twists at the very end, but 'The Village' takes a somewhat different step, perhaps unnoticed to the untrained eye. The entire movie still looks and feels exactly the same as the rest of M.'s previous movies, which, in this case is more of a negative than a positive thing, yet at the same time it's exactly this rich quality of production that gives it the strongest assets. Let's face it, 'The Village' is yet another one of M.'s misunderstood movies due to 'poorly educated' viewers. I'm talking about the type that doesn't get the blatantly obvious or the blatantly irrelevant and writes posts like 'what color does Ivy see in Luscious and her father'. A Non-important, Irrellevant one, btw!. The exquisite ensemble of actors and actresses (special kudos to the sexy redhead Bryce Dallas Howard) made the script breathe and gave sense to M's story. But what saved the whole movie was the musical score. James Newton Howard singlehandedly brought life to 'The Village'. What this man does is beyond me, I can describe it only as perfection. Every score he has so far composed for M felt like the movie was made after the score so it could blend in just the right way. The music editing deserves a ton of recognition and praise as well because it gave the movie just the right tone and atmosphere. M's movies have always demanded the viewers utmost attention, and so far this has always been rewarded many times over. 'The Village' will probably be remembered as one of his weakest and least liked movies, and I have to understand why. He has been using the same style of story-telling since 1999 and this movie should have been an exception because it stands out. The story is minimalistic (as are the 'twists' towards the end) and if one doesn't pay enough attention the main theme of the movie gets easily lost. It's love! I think. The plot, the motives, even the explanations are pretty shaky but this movie delivers numerous amazing moments that I know I'll just want to see over and over again. M is THE MASTER of subtlety and if you won't see it in 'The Village' you won't see it anywhere else! And it's exactly these incredibly subtle, thought-out scenes that have immense power and are the best parts (literally) of the movie. It's because of them that I enjoyed 'The Village' as much as I did and looked past the simple story that never even intended to be the key thing here (it's even revealed before the end). It's unnoticed things like cinematography that treats the character of Ivy differently that any other character because she can't see, it's the barely noticed tear on her left cheek that falls down her face when Luscious declares his love to her, it's the expression that he makes when he gets stabbed, it's the breath-takingly perfect last 5 seconds of the movie, then the score with instant fade to blackpriceless! I sincerely have to admit I have no idea what happened to the 60 million dollar budget and where it went to, but 'The Village' does feel rich (despite mostly being in a very minimalistic location), full of details, and manages to provide the absolute best of sound, style, cinematography, acting and music making it an absolute treat for the senses. And I actually like the fact that this movie is generally hated, it makes it more mine on some personal level. 7/10Recommendations: any avid fans of M, you are the ones that will appreciate this movie, anyone into great sound and music editing, cinematography, outstanding acting performancesthe works. BUT A WORD OF CAUTION-don't expect much from the story, this time the movie relies completely on the actors and the solid production.",7,8,11,18 December 2005
American Psycho," Confusing
","This is a movie I would probably not bother seeing, had it not been for its trailer. I was on vacation in Las Vegas and saw the trailer which was really convincing, for some reason. I saw it so many times that I remembered all the lines everybody said. And the music, used in the background was great. After seeing this movie in the comfort of my home I can only say that it is a very confused movie. I didn't quite get it. The main reason why I liked it was Christian Bale, who could definitely pass for an American. With honors! But the ending of the movie is sort of disappointing and the movie altogether is short. But the way the movie is made really impressed me. It was like watching a big budget movie, but only the good parts, when in fact it was made for a much smaller amount of money. But it's very confusing.",8,0,1,5 February 2002

I'm glad as it is I didn't pay to see this movie in the cinema, but rented it instead. Afterwards I was completely without any strength or energy to do anything, because it really put me down. Enough words lost over this movie!!! A huge disappointment.",9,0,0,5 February 2002
American Beauty," I was such a fool
","I almost pity myself. How I wasn't able to comprehend this movie a couple of years ago is totally beyond me. I hated it, despised it actually and right now, after giving it a second view I understand why a couple of people actually bothered and sent me practically threatening letters. Now I know why; how can you not love this movie. A raw satire that doesn't show life from a perspective, it just shows it, period! It shows us that life is very beautiful, you just have to do something with it and not let others run it for you. And that's exactly what Lester Burnham does. Wow,  at least I didn't overlook Mr. Spacey's performance the first time around. His performance deserved all the positive attention it got and I know exactly what won over the Oscar people. It was the smile when Jane Burnham(Mena Suvari) tells him his daughter (Thora Birch) is really happy because she's in love. Perhaps the most endearing, most authentic(if you put yourselves into his shoes) and most wonderfully sincere smile I have ever seen. For real. What an immature person I must have been less that two years ago to find this movie both boring and sad. It is one of the highlights of the previous decade and to those who found my first comment, shall I say, offensive- I truly apologize and hope that I've learned to become a more experienced movie fan to not let pieces of sheer beauty like this slip by me. A wonderful cast that truly shines in the last half hour makes 'American Beauty' amazing. Adding great cinematography, music and direction makes it a masterpiece. 9/10",9,1,2,30 August 2003
Van Helsing," Lord Of The Rings gone very bad
","'Van Helsing' never becomes what it wanted to be. I'm guessing that was supposed to be a mix of modern-age (kind of hip, if you will) and old-school (the look of the monsters) wrapped around two of the hottest Hollywood stars and a dash of a plot. Blah, you've seen practically everything this movie has to offer in other, better movies and after the LOTR trilogy this one looks pretty cheap. A budget of 160mill wasted on bad, over used and recycled special effects, 'Van Helsing' thinks that CGI redeems all its other flaws. That theoretically might have been the case had these effects been better and used much much wiser that they actually are-by the gallon! There's so much of this that it gets tedious after the first half hour, and that's 2 hours more to go! Absolutely nothing positive comes to my mind after seeing this crap (apart from the side-kick Carl, some genuinely sarcastic and funny moments and the actor playing Dracula-he looks like he's really enjoying himself and does impressive work with his script) The two main protagonists are not even worth mentioning, Hugh just does his job and Kate plays a stereotypical Romanian-accented woman.Bad bad bad, I would enjoy it immensely bashing it some more but I have better things to doRecommendations: a perfect movie for study breaks. A hardcore popcorn-movie you can see 15-20 minutes of every study break and know exactly where the story left-mainly because it doesn't go far;)PeaceP.S. to big-shot Hollywood producers-stop making such CRAP!!!",5,1,3,16 November 2005
Save the Last Dance," Some nice dance moves but a cliche
","A strong cast and a 'touchy' subject make this movie worth watching, especially if you add some good dance scenes.

Spider-Man," What a hype
","It's a usual procedure to compare newly spawned comic-book based movies with Burton's 'Batman' and rightfully so as it is only a small step away from perfection. After doing just this I came up with the following:THE COSTUMES: Spidey's is great but the Goblin really does look like a badly done creature from the Power RangersTHE MUSICAL THEME: As far as I'm concerned one of the most important parts of a comic-book based movie. Well I didn't really expect Elfman to surpass his Batmen theme, but the music in 'Spidey' is hardly ever noticeable and besides sounding very similar to much of his previous work, lacks in atmosphere and should have been much more powerful and striking. One of Elfman's worst.THE BIRTH OF A SUPER HERO: They wanted to show how 'Spidey' came to be and I have no real complaints except for not making the most of it. The most enjoyable part of this movie for me was the part where Peter Parker is discovering his super powers. This movie was intended as the first of many so why didn't they take some more time to explore his newly given strenghts as they sure won't be able to do so later.THE VILLAIN: Oh please, anybody can wear a mask, if they decided to go for the cheap, move-free mask they could have at least made it cooler looking. Dafoe didn't do it for me, he seemed to weak and sympathetic-looking to be a worthy, let alone dangerous opponent. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS: They sucked in the trailers, they sucked in the movie. Some unnecessary scenes like the one where Parker is jumping from rooftop to rooftop are so bad I couldn't believe my eyes. There are some nice moments in the movie, no doubt, but even 'Superman(1978)' , and notice the year of release made me want to fly. Spiderman made me want to kick the s..t from all those special effects 'artist' because they did such a low standard job.THE ACTION: To be honest I don't really remember any good action parts since they were all ruined by the special effects. Mediocre at best.THE FEMALES: I don't find Kirsten Dunst to be very attractive, but she did an OK job. But I liked the kissing scene. Aunt May doesn't look like she's going to make it to the sequel.THE REST OF THE CAST: J.K. Simmons is the only one worth mentioning for his portrayal of the ever cynical and spider-hating Jonah Jameson. He looks exactly like his character in the comics and the cartoon. It's one of those lucky casting marvels(like Hugh Jackman's Wolverine)AND THE FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURHOOD HIMSELF: Well, Maguire's not bad at all, but as soon as an emotional scene arises I knew exactly why many people thought he was a mistake. He just looks so passive all the time and he has the most ridiculous cry, but I like his goofie scenes and expressions. Oh well, we're stuck with him for some time.I guess I didn't really compare 'Spidey' with 'Batman', but all those enthusiastic Spidey fans would probably be furious if I did because it would be tough to spot a positive quality.ANYWAYS, THE FINAL VERDICT: Although possessing some nice moments(all in the first half of the movie, where Parker is exploring himself) the movie lacks a solid (PG-13 free) script(and none of those 'We'll met again, Spiderman' or 'You're out Goblin, out of your mind'. It's just not necessary!!!). I liked Raimi's 'Darkman' much better, with all those cheesy effects and everything, because it had heart. 'Spiderman' could have been spectacular, but wound up being a mediocre summer disappointment that earned itself over 400 million US dollars. 6/10",6,1,2,13 June 2003
Ratatouille," Feeling just slightly sub-par compared to the Pixar 'greats'
","I'll be quite honest, I think this is definitely Mr Bird's weakest feature film so far, but that's not really saying much since 'Ratatouille' is still pretty darn good (...plus I should also mention that 'The Iron Giant' and 'The Incredibles' are my favorite animated movies). Bird's great and very distinctive sense of humor is still here, but not in abundance like I was used to from his previous work, which is probably what I missed the most. 'Ratatouille' is luckily faaar superior to last year's 'Cars', it's got great visuals and truly incredible voice-overs, but it mysteriously failed to impress me. My best guess is that Mr Bird has so far managed to set the bar so high it simply wasn't possible to go anywhere but down. But not severely, I respect the man for trying different stuff every time, for finding mesmerizing and captivating stories and bringing them to the big screen, and for always having great sense for everything, be it random details, voice actors, character animation. I hope this movie positively surprises at the box office, so far the buzz has been kind of mixed, which is to be expected since last year's Pixar's weakest and dullest entry 'Cars' failed to make an impression. In the long run I predict 'Ratatouille' will be fondly remembered, adored by some, but mostly feeling just slightly sub-par compared to the Pixar 'greats'. But let's not forget how high their average is;) 7/10",7,4,9,27 June 2007
The Fast and the Furious," An entertaining no-brainer
","'Fast And The Furious' is nothing revolutionary, even the car scenes aren't as good as I'd hoped for, but you just have to like the world these characters are living in. Fast cars equals having gorgeous women at every corner (loved the sexy Michelle Rodriguez) and dodging cops all day long.The acting's nice, the cars look good(but a far cry from great since, with the great exception of Diesel's 900 horse power monster, they all look too much alike), and the women doubly so, but the plot in this movie is just the glue that binds together. Some compare this movie to 'Point Break'. Please, the only thing they have in common is that the guy is an undercover cop that lets the 'bad guy' go free. A good popcorn movie, nothing more.  6/10",6,1,3,17 March 2003
The Exorcist," Should have seen it in 73
","Well, I wasn't even born back then so I had to rent it on video. Well, what do you say about the (arguably) most horrific movie EVER MADE. After seeing it I can say that it's definitely more disgusting than it is scary, containing some of the most disturbing images I have ever seen (and believe me, it's really really hard to show ME something that'll throw me off line!!!!!)I'm talking about the scene where the mother looks at the stairs and sees her demon-possessed daughter speeding(crawling) down them on her hands and feet. Or the one where she's 'offering' herself to her mother, jumping up and down the bed. But apart from that the movie's merely disgusting(the barfing, masturbating). It is definitely one of the most influential horror movies ever made(now there's something new) ,has a good story(something most modern horror movies seriously lack!!!) and imagining I would watch it in a theater in 73 I'd probably be scared as hell. Even today, a couple of hours after watching it I can honestly say that some things will never be the same. It's probably the hype surrounding the movie that made it what it is today, but nontheless it's a movie every movie lover should see. Although, sadly it has been shamelessly copied in numerous movies, like 'Stigmata', where Gabryel Byrne's character is a twin copy of Max von Sydow's father Merrin. But the question that really bugs me is what kind of parents would let their child have anything to do with this kind of movie. And I came to the conclusion that Linda Blair was probably an orphan. I mean she had to be, or she had some irresponsible parents. I can't imagine what an experience like that does to a kid. DAMN!!!! A movie that after almost 30 years still does the trick. 7/10",7,1,2,22 September 2002
American History X," A movie that makes you think
","After I saw this movie I couldn't stop thinking about it. I was supposed to meet some friends afterwards and go out like every Friday, but I couldn't stop thinking about the movie, so I called them and said I was going home. And I couldn't stop thinking about it even after I had gone to sleep.It's so, I don't know, thought provoking I guess. Definitely changed the way I thought about some things. Go see it, you won't be disappointed.",9,0,1,1 February 2002
Pearl Harbor," What's the deal with the women in these movies
","CONTAINS SPOILERS I saw this movie on DVD (I thank the stars for that, since it gave me time to prepare for this movie, having heard the reviews and all) and have to say it was slightly, SLIGHTLY people!, better from what I was expecting. This of course is due to the so many times praised and unbelievable fighting scene. But that's it!!!!! The rest of the movie is completely lost. COMPLETELY. The whole movie, well let's face it, the whole chick flick(we've got everything here, the cute actor, the woman that has to choose, and of course the touching score), relies on the romantic triangle between the three actors. Kate Beckinsale is probably the only person that put everything she could into her role. The others just rode along. Ben Affleck, after Chasing Amy, deserves just an OK, and that Hartnett fellow is nothing thrilling, no new discovery as some claim. But this story is so immensely dumb and presented in such a way you get the feeling that the whole attack on Pearl Harbor was rigged so the 'third wheel' (in this case the Hartnett boy) would be fairly and properly disposed of. Quite sad, actually. You will not find character development in this movie as it is too busy finding a way to get rid of Danny Walker.I should say that I was, and still am a huge fan of Bay's movie, because I find them very entertaining and filled with energy and style. I am talking about BAD BOYS(8/10) and THE ROCK(9/10), while ARMAGEDDON(4/10)should be seen by thirteen year old's and extremely patriotic Americans only. The way he presents movie is amazing. The camera movements and the way he uses light and slow motion is unbelievable, it was the only highlight of this movie.This movie goes in the 2nd category of Bay's movie as it lacks just about everything there is to make such a movie. Bay should definitely stick to making pure action movie or get a capable and propper writer to write the romantic crap. Because that's what you'll find here. Whoever found the romantic development plausible is either a person I feel really sorry for, because he clearly possesses the IQ of a raisin or in the other case is a teenage girl, either with a huge crush with one of the male actors, or without a boyfriend hence not being able to understand these things(sorry, but it's true).You'll recognize the female part of the commentators immediately; 'Great romantic movie', 'People were so unfair to this movie' and similar. They most likely cried at the end, every single one of them, and that's OK, but please, not because the Hartnett fellow died. I admit, I had a lump in my throat, you know the one you have when you are at the verge of crying, but I had it because I felt really sorry for Ben Affleck's character. He got the leftovers, so to speak, as the love of his life slept with another man (some special gal, huh, and with his best friend to be exact - it could happen, sure, but not on the first date and not so soon, that is, if she really was in love with Affleck's character, even though he was supposedly dead)got pregnant with him(Hartnett), told Affleck she would choose him(Hartnett) despite being 'immensely' in love with Affleck, since he was the father of her unborn child, but since he(Hartnett) died, saving Affleck's life, well now, then she would of course 'choose' Affleck. AAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHH. Even now I feel really sorry for Affleck's character. It really makes me cry. Sure, he could forgive his best friend eventually, but the woman, come on, she's the biggest slut ever portrayed on the big screen. I can't help but think that she would never have chosen Affleck if Hartnett were to live, and she says that to Affleck too, but why does she end up with Affleck, surely not because Hartnett dies. If this is the case, well, then this woman is just looking out for herself, not caring about others. How would you feel if the love of your life told you she couldn't be with you because of another man, but when he would die, she'd 'choose' you.She clearly doesn't know the meaning of being faithful to somebody.As was the case in Titanic, the woman is guilty for screwing up the future of her man. In Titanic Kate Winslet is so selfish she doesn't even think of asking Leonardo to climb on the BIG piece of wooden raft. In this movie the woman ends up with a man, whose life and his relationship she ruins in the process. Disgusting. Sad. I was appalled.I will not try to pretend to know the whole deal about Pearl Harbor and the stories surrounding it, but the way it is portrayed in this movie is offensive. A totally patriotic movie, elevating America to an even further ground(Independence Day anyone), showing others as negative and inferior. The line where an old Japanese man (just after they hit Pearl Harbor)says they have just awoken a giant, or something like that is a statement I will not even comment. I will however end this too long comment by, well commenting on the opening scene where the young Affleck and Hartnett are playing. Needless to say, they are shooting German bastards, or something like that. But when they say those lines, something like 'Nobody messes with America.' -'Land of the free' 'Home of the brave'. MAN, when they said that I of course knew what a crappy movie this was going to be, BUT MOST OF ALL I WANTED TO KICK THEIR REDNECK, YOACKLE ASSES, THEY WERE SO ANNOYING. Please Mr. Bay, no more of this. Once was enough. Stick to action movies. 3/10",4,0,1,16 February 2002
The Usual Suspects," Only see this movie once
","If there was ever a movie that was composed of the perfect cast it was this one. Pollak, Baldwin, Del Toro, Byrne and Spacey give all give their best at this movie. The director, Bryan Singer made another excellent movie, Apt Pupil, but then chose to make a big (or at least a lot bigger) budget disappointment, the X-men. It had great actors in it (again!), but lacked a propper story (The senator should stay alive, because this way there won't be any sentinels).But enough about The X-men. This movie is what Singer will be forever known. But a word of caution, if you haven't seen it, do so, of course, but avoid seeing it again, because some minor mistakes in the story will make the experience less enjoyable.But then again, who am I, your mother.     10/10",9,0,1,5 February 2002
Blue Crush," BLatant CRap
","A feel good chick surfer movie. The bad kind. Need I say more. Maybe. Sexy lead actresses, some incredibly nice underwater shots and shots of waves, not much of a story, a lame surf-stylewannabe soundtrack, but still, there's an idea as to what a surfer's life should look like, except here it (with little surprise) all about being number one and getting rich and famous. In between there's some unnecessary comic relief and a love story if you believe that's what it is.Recommend - if you liked 'Coyote Ugly' then this movie has your name on it. Otherwise just skip it and rent 'Point Break' instead. And if you're really into surfing find a movie called 'Sprout'. You'll thank me",5,10,21,19 November 2004
Saving Private Ryan," One of the best war movies ever made
","From the literally breath taking opening sequence, which immediately became a standard which newer movies would only try to touch ('Gladiator') to the brilliant photography and sound, unprecedented cinematic achievements that Spielberg became very fond of (I think he used the ENR process in 'Minority Report' as well) and the Oscar worthy performances of every single leading actor. So what exactly is missing, what possible thing makes 'Saving Private Ryan' one of the best and not maybe the best war movie of all time. It's the final message. I though that just ending the movie with the elderly Ryan, comforted by the thought that he was indeed a good man who lived his life the best he could was just to trivial to be inserted in the movie. And of course Spielberg had to take a long final shot of the American flag, despite the fact that the movie was almost completely fictional when it came to the plot. But despite these flaws the movie is spectacular and is one of the best movies of 1998, falling in second place to 'The Thin Red Line' which should have won every Oscar it was nominated for. But then again, loosing to 'Shakespeare In Love' hurts every bit as much. A visual triumph. War never looked so real and brutal. 8/10",8,0,0,1 February 2003
Seabiscuit," The little horse that could
","What Seabiscuit doesn't fully achieve is give the topic of the movie a 100% credibility. This is something very common in Hollywood movies portraying a specific era or person. 'A Beautiful Mind' or 'Cinderella Man' anyone. But this is a minor problem, the movie as a whole is a solid accomplishment. It has a hell of a lot more virtues than debilities, the strongest of the former being the editing and storytelling. We are left to fill many pieces in for ourselves, always a sign of a smart movie that doesn't underestimate it's viewers, and the editing made sure that certain scenes stay in the viewer's head (a particular one being the first race Seabiscuit wins, or the very ending of the movie). The ensemble of actors works great and even Tobey Maguire (whom I usually find unsatisfactory given his abilities of emotional span) shines. Overall apart from being too much of a crowd pleaser this movie will stick around for a long time as being a beautiful addition in movie-making.8/10Recommendations: everybody!",8,1,2,12 February 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Such an overrated movie
","This was one of the worst movie experiences of the year 2001, no, make that of my life. Everybody was saying the story was so beautiful and how it touched them and that it will surely win an Oscar for best picture, but I was disappointed to even see it nominated in that category. And it definitely stole  it for best score. But enough about that. The one and only thing the movie's got going for it are the amazing fighting scenes wich are done really well and precise. But that's it. The rest of the movie (except, well, Zhang Ziyi) is really boring and complete garbage. The movie really put me down and I can't remember when I last fell that depressed. Afterwards I just went home and went to bed at 10 o' clock on a Friday night. I have to blame everything on the people that put together the trailer of the movie - they presented it as a sort of kung fu movie, making sure that they only showed the action sequences and the effects (about 15% of the movie) and none of the boring stuff (you do the math). And that has never happened to me before, I always knew al least what kind of a movie I was going to see, so imagine my surprise: there I am, watching the movie, expecting to see lots of action and the characters just keep babbling about a magical sword and talking about read-it-between-the-lines love. Blah. And I knew this movie would be bogus the moment I found out who was directing it - mister sensibility himself, I just convinced myself I'd give it a chance. After this crap I began appreciating my instincts a whole lot more.But it couldn't have been that bad a movie says the layman; let me put it this way, I consider myself an eye-candy man, meaning that I have seen all kinds of crappy movies, but hey, if they had decent effects, if they were presented in an interesting way, mercy, if they even had a decent musical accompaniment, they had something to offer, they were at least viewable. Well, this movie has special effects that should be seen with a bib only, but the story, it really hurts just to remember myself about it, well for the story you need a vomit bag, the kind they have aboard airplanes, SO I DEFINITELY NEVER, EVER WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE EVER AGAIN (except the Zhang Ziyi part). A waste of time, but a good movie if you're the masochist type.",5,0,1,1 February 2002
The Number 23," Not exploited enough
","Like this year's 'Next' with Nicholas Cage I can't stop but feel this movie had so much more to offer. Although the execution of the movie was somewhat superior to 'Next', they both follow a really similar storyline AND they both failed to use what was laying around their backyards.I missed those goose-bumpy feelings, the ones I get when something falls so perfectly into place that it simply couldn't have been done any better...after all 'The number 23' is a thriller, and the 3rd act is always the most important...Sadly, the end result is too Hollywood for my taste, the idea of somebody writing a book and forgetting about it is pretty interesting, but it could have been done much better.I missed more explanation behind the 'infamous' number 23 itself, how it came to be, why it would pop out on every corner of human history etc, after all the movie revolves around it, and the whole ordeal simply felt just like an excuse to make a story for a movie...Sadly, it remained so throughout the whole movie.I missed more of Jim Carrey's book narration, to me the absolute best part of this movie was when he starts reading it and narrates us through the author's words...that's when the movie really got my attention...Sadly, the remainder of the book doesn't come anywhere near these moments and looks and feels like about a gazillion other popular movies with flashbacks.A movie, that like 'Next' could have been a masterpiece had it been done 20-40 years ago by a more daring crew of filmmakers, a movie that like 'Next' failed to explore the very interesting topic it imposes on us (quite stupid really) and a movie, that like 'Next' bombed at the Box office....Destiny...?;) MY MORAL OF THE STORY: A potentially good story for a movie is surprisingly rare to come by these days. The right people should know that it should be treated with the utmost care by a far superior director",6,8,12,3 June 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Two Towers
","Has it really been a year. With 'The Two Towers' it certainly doesn't look so, because I was immediately thrown back into this epic adventure and even quicker reminded of its brilliance. The second installment of the Tolkien novel is shere perfection when it comes to visual and sound style, be it the special effects(which are basically flawless and have come a long way since 'The Fellowship Of The Ring') or the beautiful photography or the amazing score and sound effects. But what it doesn't have is the essence of the first one, the atmosphere which was just too strong and great to last forever. Instead the movie relies on its final battle scenes (during which I often found my mouth wide open)and forgets about the fellowship. Aragorn is given new depth as he has much mores screen time and becomes the hero of this movie and Frodo discovers a new friend, Gollum, shere brilliance of computer animation. Despite the lack of 'fellowship' from the first one 'The Two Towers' provides for an unprecedented visual feast which, after 'The Matrix' or 'Minority Report' speaks for itself.  It's is probably going to be the weakest of the Ring Trilogy because let;s face it; Peter Jackson has spoiled us rotten, but it's still damn near perfection. 8/10",8,0,0,28 January 2003
The Mist," A movie that teaches to never give up...no matter what!!!
","Say what you will, but I'm sticking to the title of my comment. It's been a while since a movie played me like the piano, and Frank Darabont's 'The Mist' managed to permanently etch itself into my mind for numerous reasons. But I'll skip most of them and name just one: it has one of the most memorable endings I've ever seen. The whole movie is pretty good, but the ending made it a great one. The last 5 minutes are simply WOW! This is because Darabont manages to easily add a surprising new aspect to the already multi-layered story and characters...it is undoubtedly the most powerful one in the whole movie, and it fits the mood of the last act PERFECTLY.Whatever the reason to change the original book ending was, the director knew exactly what he was doing! He successfully avoided the lame, ambiguous anticlimax of letting the viewer decide the fate of the survivors for him/herself...and I have to admit, I really thought I saw that one coming.Instead you see exactly what happens and how the story ends. Darabont knew there were already too many things left unexplained as it was, so he concluded what he had at his disposal...the human character. This ending is where I got the inspiration for the title of my comment because that's exactly what 'The Mist' taught me! ...this is where I part, dear reader. If you haven't seen 'The Mist' yet, you have something to look forward to:)",8,2,6,26 November 2007
The Elephant Man," Deeply touching
","At the end of this movie i had such a big lump in my throat it almost hurt. What a touching movie. As if it were made for the single reason to make you cry, and believe me there's a big chance you will. It was one of those movies I saw simply by chance and at the end was so impressed because of the unexpected impact it made on me. Beautiful.   10/10",10,1,1,30 January 2002
No Man's Land," A good movie, but nothing special
","Everybody has been praising this movie since it came out, but I find it to be rather mediocre. Nothing new (maybe the fact that the war was going on in , nothing breathtaking (except maybe for the ending when the Bosnian soldier is left to die). A movie made to please the audience, especially foreign, which in some cases don't quite know the whole truth. If you want a real portrait of atmosphere and life during the war go rent a movie called Rane. Now that's a shocker.",7,0,2,12 February 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," Highly unpleasant to watch
","I will make my comment brief since I want to forget this junk as soon as possible. Why would anyone make a movie about an unamusing (no offense to those who actually lived to tell the tale) story about an accident in the Russian navy. Besides the very story  had already been made into a movie some years before, why try and make a 'fancy' Hollywood version as well.Furthermore, why would anyone want to see this movie. It's overly long, boring, extremely unpleasant to watch(I think the cast didn't have a fun time either) and in the end I felt robbed of two hours when I could spend one watching a K-19 documentary(which would without a doubt be more accurate and fun to watch) on the discovery channel. Watch closely to witness Harrison Ford's worst role and acting yet. A terrible miscast. The makers of this movie were actually surprised by the box office failure, I am shocked this movie was ever made. 4/10",4,1,3,2 August 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Terrible trumpery
","Renting this crap was a huge mistake. What was I thinking. I totally hated 'Romeo & Juliet', and this looked even worse in the trailers. Plus the ever so annoying 'Lady Marmelade'. Uuuugggggghhhh. Well I rented it because I was curious. My parents saw it in the cinema and they said they'd had walked out after 10 minutes if they hadn't been sitting in the middle of the row. And then there was this friend of mine that said 'Moulin Rouge' was the greatest movie ever made. HA I admit my parents are no Siskel & Ebert (not that they were any better), for example they hated 'The Godfather' and thought 'The Lord Of The Rings' was boring and unrealistic. Yeah! Anyway, I was faced with a dilemma. Believe my parents or a guy that once engraved a cross on his hand with a pencil. Not that other's opinions count, not by far, but I just had to see this movie, curiosity u see.The only solution was to rent the movie.Who said that curiosity was a good thing. After seeing this movie I can say that IGNORANCE IS BLISS!!!! It starts of funny with that man conducting to the 20th century fox opening theme. But as soon as the movie picks up the pace and blasts you into a Luhrmann vison of the France during 1900 you get the general idea. Fast and awkward editing spoils, no, destroys a nice concept to revive a little piece of music and bring it to the big screen in style.This movie could have easily been stupendous and could singlehandedly bring back the zhanra of musicals. Instead I was left with the feeling that it was made very poorly, most of the sets were awful, and there was that dreadful windmill that got more screen time that most of the actors. Besides the first five minutes there's nothing to like about this movie except the somewhat good performance by Nicole Kidman. She definitely has her moments and was the only reason why I didn't push the 'STOP' button on the remote control. Still, what demon possessed her to star in this one. Ewan McGregor, showing off his pearly yellowies, was watchable but in my opinion miscast. The others aren't worth talking about.It's not easy to make a musical that has a terrible sound track. Baz Luhrmann, I salute you. To shamelessly make use of many great songs and not make a single one sound even half as good as the original, now that takes true talent.A love story that is predictable and makes very little sense since Satine falls in love with Christian after he sings her a song. Is that all it takes, a song. C'mon, here we have a curtisan who daily plays with men for money and as soon as one of them breaks a base she's swept off her feet. The movie gets so boring in the 2nd half I started feeling a little masochistic, but I had to see the ending. All I can say is that nominating this movie for anything besides the 'Razzies' is ludicrous and insulting to movies. Because this is nothing short of a really bad play, and that's where it should belong, on a rotting stage in bloody England. Don't get me wrong, it's not really that bad, it's just that the director is soooo much worse. I have to commend Mr. Luhrmann, for he has again surprised and amazed me with his lack of style, taste and colors.Congratulations.Without doubt the worst musical ever made.           3/10",4,0,2,29 April 2002
Pi," Great movie, great music
","This is one one of those movies you never heard anything about, but when you see it, you wander why the hell not. A low budget extravaganza. With a very simple story, which compelled me right till the end. And accompanied by great music. Very sadly, this movie was totally ignored untill people with some taste actually recognized it for what it was. Brilliant.       10/10",9,2,4,5 February 2002
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Unexpectedly good
","Never knew George Clooney had such talent as a director (I have yet to see 'Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind). His work on this movie is nothing less than brilliant. He managed to capture the feel and the look of the era perfectly. He moved through the story with such ease, simplicity and effectiveness that it's almost a crime the movie isn't longer. I was definitely yearning for more at the end, a rare occasion. The actors are splendid all around, David Strathairn being the crown jewel. A smart movie that realises it's limitations and uses them into it's advantage (the usage of footage being the only portrayal of senator McCarthy being one of them). A delightfully fresh breeze of air that only comes along every so often, 'Good Night, And Good Luck' is a great movie experience that probably won't win awards come Oscar night (p.s.-who gives a damn), but will be shared and admired among people who will discover it for what it really is - pure independent marvel, the best kind! 9/10 Recommendations: anyone who likes the era and simplistic, kind of easygoing feel of the 50's, anyone who just want's to see a smart movie",9,3,5,12 February 2006
Mulholland Drive," ??????????????
","Read the title of my review, you'll get the picture. But not literally, you sure as hell won't get Mulholland Dr. From the reviews I've read nobody has. On one side there's the Lynch fans who swear this is his greatest work, and on the other there's us who think that sometimes movie tickets should handed out for free. Because this movie isn't worth whatever amount you have to pay for a movie ticket, it isn't even a movie come to think of it, it's just this completely unedited, uncut, unshaped piece of celluloid that has no meaning whatsoever. Believe you me, WHATSOEVER. It is one of the most pointless movies ever made. But don't get me wrong, I loved 'Lost highway', I admired 'Twin Peaks', etc, because there was a point in there somewhere. After the end credits the audience just wouldn't get up, the same happened when I saw the cube, they were just bedazzled by the movie itself and cursed Lynch. 'How David Lynch didn't get lynched after this one', proclaimed an utterly upset man behind me. He was absolutely right, as if Lynch did this on purpose, a 'movie' that has no meaning, no point, no story, no connection between scenes, just to piss of the viewer, but squeazing in a couple of sexy scenes between this really amazing brunette and a goody goody blonde just to satisfy the average male. And that's exactly my point, a pointless movie should be treated with the same attitude",5,0,1,15 August 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Too silly for Tarantino
","So I finally saw 'Kill Bill', Tarantino's fourth movie. UUUUUUuuuuuuuuu. To be honest, I'm kind of glad I didn't get the chance to see it in the cinema, it was kind of a bummer watching it over at my friend's house. The first half or so is, apart from the dry script, more or less great, brilliant cinematography, great music and there's a true Tarantino-ish feel to it. But the big fight in the end is overly silly and spoils the atmosphere filled with anticipation. Really cheesy blood effects that were perhaps intentionally cheesy get tiresome after the first dozen cut off limbs or so, and the whole movie just seems to loose its edge and witt. I definitely want to see the second volume, just this time anticipation will be left at home. A really nice nostalgic and cinematographic effort by the foot fetish director. 7/10",7,0,1,11 March 2004
Saw II," 'Saw' it once. 'Saw' it 'Twice'
","Not nearly as brilliant as its predecessor 'Saw II' forgets about the strongest reason why the first one worked so well. It was a devilish cocktail of a great plot with many turns and thrills, solid acting, impressive cinematography and most of all, psychotic frightful tests Jigsaw made his 'patients' go through. 'Saw II' feels a bit off from this, trying hard to maintain and even surpass the level of 'Saw', but the bar the latter set is surprisingly high and although this movies mainly sticks to the same formula (it was even made for peanuts of a budget like the first one) the intensity and originality are GONE!!! No doubt this is because a different director took over, which is NEVER good with successful movies-I will die of shock when a sequel not made by the same director as the original is better.'Saw II' holds on fairly strong (especially considering the above statement), but the characterization of the 'test subjects' (for the lack of a better word/expression) is nowhere to be found. This, later on in the movie, doesn't prove to be a wise choice because I just couldn't care less who would make it out alive-compared to the original where I broke a sweat before Cary Elwes even started tightening his shirt above his ankle. I will applaud the plot, and the way it's going to progress into another sequel, but somebody lost all the imagination that made the 'tests' in the first one so chilling to watch. That was the best part, damn it! Overall, 'Saw II' feels as if I've already seen all of this before somewhere and that's what makes it fail as a sequel. The cast doesn't stand out (which it probably even shouldn't, but their performances are weaker than not), Beverly Mitchell just feels all-the-way wrong among them going for that 'don't want to be type-cast' thing, and Jigsaw could have had a script worthy of his screen presence to enlighten us with his fu...d-up philosophy of appreciating life.7/10-Appreciated the plot unraveling, thought the rest was weaker than in the original.",7,0,0,22 November 2005
Black Hawk Down," The DVD extras were almost better than the movie
","When it comes to DVD's there's nothing more annoying than renting a 2 disc movie(which is becoming a standard with the block busters) and then realize the movie sucks which means there's no point in watching the 2nd disc because it's usually about the making of the movie. Well this movie wasn't bad on its own, but it was quite a bad war movie. All the remarkable and beautiful photography(the scene where the hawks are hovering above the sea is forever burnt into my mind)the brilliantly done special effects and Zimmer's score couldn't fully compensate for the poor story and lack of character development. If you watch the extra disc you actually hear the screenwriter and some other people say that they excluded a majority of the actual characters from the original events in order to give the viewer a chance to understand and feel with the important ones. They failed miserably, I couldn't care less for the people portrayed in the movie. War movies usually have some meaning, a moral ending, an abstract ending, something to show how terrible and useless it is. This movie was more like a documentary, but who cares if 19 American soldiers died in some war where so more innocent people were killed before the free world actually did something about it. They didn't have to go to Somalia, they certainly weren't forced. And how does Ridley Scott honor the fallen men. Well, the note at the end speaks for itself. A disgrace, that can only be surpassed by that dear dear movie entitled pearl harbor. It seems that when Jerry Bruckheimer doesn't produce excellent action movies he makes terrible war movie with excellent directors instead. What a waste, because the production value, the acting, the visual and sound effects and photography, even the score(which sounds suspiciously like Zimmer's 'The thin red line':) ), all is sadly spoiled by the story.7/10",7,0,0,25 October 2002
A Bug's Life," Another great Pixar movie
","I just love these animated Disney movies. They aren't made just for the kids and many adults find them to be very funny. They just have this appeal that I can't explain, but it gets the better of me every time. None of my friends wanted to see Toy Story when it came out. When the 2nd Toy Story was released they were the first to buy the tickets. This movie is very funny and entertaining and can be seen over and over again, a great DVD buy.   9/10",8,0,0,11 February 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Mind boggling special effects
","The main reason why I liked this movie, besides the brilliant musical accompaniment by the Strausses, were the amazing special effects. And this movie dates back to, well a very long time ago, 1968 to be exact. I don't know how he did it, the scene where the spaceship is landing on the moon, and the dome starts to open, or the one where  Dr. Poole is running around and around. It blew me away, and even if t is just a cheap trick, I don't care, it looks fenommenal, the way special effects should - so that you don't notice that they're fake. Well these certainly did not. And I just love those scenes where the spaceships are cruising and you hear the classical music - so perfect. And the movie itself wasnt bad -just very, very bizarre.",9,1,4,1 February 2002
Saw," Pure horror
","It's been a long while since I was this scared while watching a movie and I have to say it felt great! I was never a fan of slasher movies, they always seemed to deliver (and still do) such cheap and short thrills it felt a waste of unexplored potential. Now 'Saw' comes along, maybe the most thrilling, disturbing, horrific and fresh movie of the year, (plus immense kudos for making it on such an outstandingly small budget), and proves my previously mentioned point perfectly. Either way, I'll repeat it again-slasher movies are for pus.ies! Everything in this movie surprised me, and every surprise was more than welcome. Like the dreadful Jigsaw's mind 'Saw' feels prepared in advance and knows exactly what it has to do. Set the trap, pick a victim (us, the audience), and leave everything else into our hands. I was genuinely petrified in every 'trap' scene, some work just because of great imagination and the main one because of the story and acting. I probably wouldn't have recognized Cary Elwes in his role, and somehow a combination of low budget meets known celebrity faces works really well. I will give you no gory details, you should go see this movie with absolutely no information whatsoever-just step into a world of senseless sense. I couldn't help but admire the crazy Jugsaw man, as sick and banal it may seem, but his character makes a lot of sense. Which, in the end, when we are let to put together all the pieces of the puzzle, makes this movie more than worth your while.Perversely enjoyable, incredibly well paced and thought out, impressively acted(and I'm talking especially about Cary Elwes's character in the end) and directed with a fresh new approach and interesting cinematography, 'Saw' is a pure cult classic. You will not forget about it, you will only appreciate it-just like Jugsaw wanted you to;)Can't wait to see the next installment!9/10 - Recommendations: Anyone who's looking for much more than a cheap thrill",8,1,2,22 November 2005
The Last Samurai," A beautiful experience
","I cannot remember the last time I was moved so much by a movie that I wept. And I wept hard. Before writing this comment I didn't bother reading any reviews or try to dig up the movie's lack of historical background, I simply loved 'The Last Samurai' for what it had to offer. In most part, beauty. The movie is quite long, but I there was never a glimpse of boredom, I devoured every scene because mr. Zwick's effort was so impressive. Oscars all around, I say, everybody who's anybody in the movie steals the show, which is kind of contradictory, but believe me, it makes some sense:) I will not waste more words, you've grasped my enthusiasm by now. And if you'll excuse me, I'll go looking for my perfect blossom.

National Treasure," Exactly what I expected
","There apparently isn't much room for coming up with adventure stories that don't, in some form or another, resemble good old Indiana Jones's series. Apparently the bar was set so high one might actually argue it actually reached the peak of adventure movies, and that's almost 25 years ago. 'National Treasure' isn't a bad movie at all, in fact it's pretty funny and at times even a tad unpredictable, but it lacks inovativity, something as I've mentioned before, hasn't been achieved in almost a quarter of a century-damn, it sounds even longer when I say it like this. How can this be, has Indie done absolutely every possible crazy stunt, been to the craziest places and discovered the most amazing things or is Hollywood just in some deadly serious hibernation state. Or have we just seen one too many similar movies and are just fed up. Well this one is luckily one of the better ones, due to a funny script and good acting by the three main protagonists, Nicholas Cage-with more hair than usual I think, Justin Bartha-a very funny actor whom I know nothing about, and a sexy Diane Kruger. Somehow Jon Voight winds up in every second movie about hidden treasures so he's quite the familiar face-nowadays you can't get a motion picture like this started if he's not in it. Harvey Keitel seems rather misplaced-not really much reason to place such a strong actor in a small role that doesn't add any crucial meaning to the whole plot. Sean Bean plays his villain the way he's played him(self) in ooh, just about every movie so far so it's pretty much a standard routine here-I'd be so bold as to say the most standard routine from a known actor. He does add some new looks and smiles here and there for a change, he actually has a different hairstyle which I think helped get him into the character of 'Sean Bean playing anyone-take 18sth', but if the saying that the movie is only as good as it's villain is true, then Sean Bean is one of the biggest mistakes in movies in the last 10 years. The more I think about it, the more I want to bash the guy right now-he genuinely sucks. 'Goldeneye', 'The Island', 'Equilibrium', even the 'Fellowship Of The Ring'-he just can't not act the same way he usually does-ergo he doesn't act at all, he just thinks he is. Apparently, so do some people in Hollywood. Me, I just know exactly what to expect and what not to-the latter being diversity.Everything else is pretty much standard here, the score is rather unnoticeable, which is always a shame in these types of movies-you should hear some familiar theme to cheer for the good guy. I think I should write a manual for adventure movies, don't you-meaning, I'm going to stop with the bickering and just end this comment.6/10-lacks inovativity and has Sean Bean and Jon Voight castRecommendations: kids, anyone who hasn't been 'spoiled' by the Indiana Jones trilogy yet, fans of Sean Bean...man, they're never disappointed are they;)",6,0,1,7 November 2005
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Great movie
","I wasn't expecting much from this movie, because everybody kept telling me how good it was and that way my expectations are always too high before I even see it.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Oh well, I guess I'm too old for this
","I did sort of like the book, but remember that Professor Gilderoy Lockhart's character had some funny class scenes which were not in the movie. Slightly better than the first one, although Daniel Radcliffe still needs some serious acting lessons as he yet again manages to ruin too many scenes with his slow and cautious babbling. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley manages to give the funniest scene in the entire movie as he manages to put a very unpleasant spell on himself. Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy looks hellishly evil and I look forward to seeing him in the fourth movie and Emma Watson is much less annoying in this second installment. But the movie is (again) overly long for what it has to tell, which is stupid since the main public are the children. Some nice scary spider moments, though. A movie where nothing is a coincidence, where everything you hear and learn will happen and where Harry Potter once again manages to look like a conceited and annoying knowitall. Should have seen in ten years ago. Wishful thinking.6/10",6,0,0,30 July 2003

When Harry Met Sally...," Not to miss
","What a great movie. The dialogues between Harry and Sally are extremely funny and interesting, they're basically everything that I like to think and talk about with my best friend. Who is a guy, and not a girl, a thing that is perfectly explained in the movie by Billy Crystal. Except for the dark side thing his character is somebody I really relate to, we just think alike. Great acting, great music, great dialogues(especially by Crystal who, at moments looks like Jerry Seinfeld;I don't know if i's those white sneakers or the dialogues:) and a bunch of very funny jokes make this movie a must see for everyone. Oh and a nice touch with those scenes where old married couples explain the (sometimes almost unbelievable) circumstances in which they met. Old people had 'Casablanca', this is a movie for the younger generations. And you don't even need the hankies.  9/10",9,7,12,5 December 2002
Ice Age," Funny and touching
","Finally I got to see the infamous 'Ice Age'. Apart from maybe not being as dead funny as I'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word I can say about it. Sure, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production(besides, it is Fox's 1st attempt at a full length CG movie) but it's got immense heart and on some occasions(like the look in Manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past) I found myself on the verge of tears. But when they reunited the baby with its father I just couldn't hold them in anymore. A movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and cliché and manages to bring more than the best out of it; the end result being one of the most touching animated creations I have ever seen. Great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you(and great voice talents as well) and many funny memorable scenes, especially from Scrat's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002.I honestly don't get it, but for some reason it really looks like CG animation will be taking the upper hand in the future. But if it just means that there will be more movies like this one (and who can forget Pixar's creations) then I don't really mind, at least for now. 9/10",9,11,16,17 September 2003
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Had a fonder memory when I was younger
","I especially remembered this one thing in particular; the amazing costume Dracula is wearing in the beginning of the film before going to battle. It looked like it was alive, like a worm had enwraped his body or something. Anyways, after a couple of years I saw this movie again and definitely didn't like it as much. I found it to have a rather poor production value and a weak ending. It does however posses some good qualities like a great score by Wojciech Kilar( a name suspiciously similar to my college professor's:) and of course Gary Oldman. His role as Dracula is almost legendary and rightfully so because his over-the-top performance fits the movie perfectly and is one of those roles that no other actor could have done half as good(like Brando's Godfather, Denzel's Training Day, Sellers Pink Panther, McDowell's A Clockwork Orange, Spacey's The Usual Suspects, etc) But the rest of the cast is more or less miserable and Keanu should thank his lucky stars for ever acting in another movie after this one. Despite being over two hours long the movie never gets boring although the ending could have provided a bigger climax. Still decent. 7/10",7,0,1,26 June 2003
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Great ending to a trilogy
","This movie just keeps getting better and better every time I see it. Entertainment at its absolute best. Someone once said that the good guy is only as good as the villain is. In this case I could not agree more. Jeremy Irons delivers an excellent performance(was he always that buffed) and Willis and Jackson just made a compatible and believable duo. They managed to top their acting skills in the M. Night Shyamalan movie Unbreakable (10+/10). Funny, highly entertaining and the story is OK(the ending is a little disappointing). As far as action movie are concerned this one has it all(well, most of of it, anyway).        8/10",7,0,0,16 February 2002
The Green Mile," And so we wept
","'The Green Mile' is an emotional bomb that leaves a mark, just as John Coffey did. Frank Darabont's masterful direction proves once again how much he cares for his characters, it's them that always make the good stories in movies. Just enough of magic to make a head turn, just enough reality to make a head bow, and more emotions than we can afford or deserve, 'The Green Mile' left me sobbing and feeling for every good soul in that movie, I simply couldn't help it. Perhaps it was meant to be, I seriously needed to shed a tear after the week I've just had.Simply put, this movie is need-to-watch material for every quality movie fan! 9/10",9,2,4,12 May 2006

Halloween," Admirable cinematography, a disappointment of a movie
","First of all I have to give praise to the very neat camera movements and a cool theme score which definitely boost the movie to a higher enjoyment level so you never have the feeling you're watching a low-budget horror movie. The first slasher movie to be exact, or so I've read. But there's not much slashing in it, which is the biggest disappointment of them all. On a Halloween night, 25 years after this movie is supposedly taking place, I expected a nice little blood bath but on the area I was most expectant 'Halloween' disappoints immensely. There's very little violence (to be honest, an average Jerry Springer episode has more of that-and bear in mind that it's even more phony on his show)and just a hint of the vein filler and the ending is so unexpected and unfulfilling it should be given a slap. On one side, I admire the movie makers for creating a big-budget-ish movie with flying colors and John Carpenter for creating the suspense he did, but on the other side the movie miserably fails the test of time since the level of violence and brutality in the present time is much greater and today's youngsters (me including) don't find it nearly as petrifying as our parents.

1408," Despite a captivating 1.st half and good acting, '1408' fails to deliver as a unique and original scary movie
","Haven't we all seen this somewhere before??? Somebody trying to escape a haunted place, ...c'mon, whoever thinks '1408' is fresh and unique is either a total movie layman or has a short-term memory. There is nothing new here, sure, the acting is pretty good (especially Sam Jackson's character), and the tension at the beginning of the story is great, but is there a law somewhere that clearly states that sometimes all further potential should be flushed down the toilet...I'v seen too many movies that go down a similar road and loose themselves in cliché's and copy/pasting of other movies.Director Håfström has a great sense of character development and knows how to shot truly captivating dialogs, but whenever there was action instead of drama he became tepid and boring...the second half feels looooong and forgettable.And some of the scenes in '1408' were truly stupid and boring...like Enslin trying to escape the room through the window...most people would first probably try knocking down the door for like two hours before even thinking about pulling a stunt like that, but Enslin is all prepped and ready to go just because the door didn't open the first time he kicked it. Then of course, you have to have the painful memories of seeing a home video and flashbacks from your past (something that in '1408''s case is so obviously thrown at us beforehand I couldn't stop but just anticipate and expect it) Then there was the matter of lousy effects that made the old victim flashbacks more annoying than amusing.I hate this movie, not because it's bad (cos it's not, the first half is actually great), but because it's like so many other failed attempts of trying to give us a scare, and also because the only thing I'v heard about it were rave reviews about how unique and horrifying it is.",6,0,0,30 September 2007
The Iron Giant," This is how movies should be made
","If there was ever an animated movie that completely surprised and overwhelmed me it's definitely this one.

And it's exactly these kinds of movies (the one's that catch you off your guard, simply surprise you in the most positive magical way, that make the best, well, movies. It deeply touched me in a way that I can only wish other movies could and I am not he least surprised it has found it's place in the IMDb's top 250 movies of all time.

Signs," Phenomenal
","What to say about a movie that changed my life? And to lean on Travolta's character from Swordfish - 'I'm not some grungy wannabe filmmaker searching for existentialism through a haze of bong smoke or something.' But realizing the message of this movie was profoundly enlightening! 'Signs' is a most felicitous mixture of hidden symbols and meanings. It goes way past other such movies because mr. Shyamalan has the utmost sense of perfection in his editing, musical score, scenery, photography, dialogues and especially actors and actresses. His movies are constantly feeding the viewer, but not stuffing them, he knows very well when to let the viewer figure and realize things out for himself. As characteristic for both 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' he provides an amazing revelation at the very end, and it left me with goose bumps till the closing credits. When I put the puzzle together it was simply magical, as if the world was an enormous map, I just had to look around and read it. The execution was yet again flawless and faultless but I do think that the initial idea of signs should have been realized in a non alien manner, which would probably make it as timeless as 'The Sixth Sense'. But I do find it most entertaining and annoying when I read comments about the movie and see that half the people didn't even get it, they just didn't like the alien CG and get all mad because they think the movie sucked. Well, in my mind the aliens were so crudely made because they were not even the main part of the story, they just began turning the wheels of the movie. As for the message the movie gives, well, I guess it just isn't for everybody. Just for those of us who can read Signs.  8/10",8,0,2,22 December 2003
Amélie," Great Big Eyes
","If you saw this movie and can honestly say you didn't like it, love it in fact, then I can honestly say that that I am speechless. There are so many wonderful emotions in this movie that even a lifelong pessimist will come out of the cinema smiling and thinking of a brighter tomorrow. The movie is very very funny and is celluloid proof that the so called 'Academy' doesn't have a clue when it comes to good movies. If you saw both 'No man's land' and 'Amelie' you should know what I mean. But no matter, those Oscar people have lost the last speck of credibility a long time ago.'Amelie' is a truly magical movie and it doesn't try to be anything else. Right from the start you are taken for a joyride through her wonderful and exciting life and it doesn't end untill, well, the movie ends.The brilliant visual portrait brings a great amount of freshness and ingenuity to the movie as well as the screenplay. There is also the score that fits perfectly with the movie and the great voice of the narrators that made me want to learn French What I didn't like about the movie was its ending, because I thought that the optimistic atmosphere of the movie was spoiled with the unnecessary and incomprehensible twist of faith(when Amelie's coworker goes out with Nino???). Because of that everything that the movie was trying to(and did) accomplish, the wonderful and surreal world of Amelie, was suddenly placed onto reality and the magic was lost.But that's just me. A movie that doesn't hide its ambitions and rightfully so, due especially to the great leading actress, without whom the movie wouldn't, couldn't have lived up to its potential. She has the most amazing eyes that could have done all the acting by themselves. I never say this, but go see it.     9/10",9,1,3,29 March 2002
Rear Window," Is this REALLY the best Hitchcock had to offer???
","In IMDb's 'Top 250' this movie ranks in the top 15, it's Hitchcock's highest ranking movie, so obviously many people see it as an exceptional one. I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about. I was eager to see it and perhaps I was expecting more, but frankly, is that so much to ask from supposedly one of the best movies ever made? +To not come off as a lover of criticism, I truly have to commend the excellent use of sound effects throughout the movie. I realized on many occasions just how smart and practical the director was in making the outside world truly come into the viewer's life. I even realize how the whole concept of the movie must have been 'fresh' back in its day, but here's where the lauding stops.-I found 'Rear Window' as a movie that definitely hasn't passed the test of time. The main set (around which the whole movie revolves) looked really fake...I mean come on, besides the incredibly wide windows that were just convenient enough for a peeping Tom to get a frigging panoramic view of everything, all of the apartments looked like two-dimensional sets from a drama play, even Jefferies's) The plot itself is almost laughable in its simplicity and more so painfully predictable. The first 30 minutes or so nothing much happens, there's a romantic subplot etc etc and when the main, murder plot comes into focus I simply realized there wasn't enough time left for it to turn anything BUT murder. So the supposed 'thrill' of the movie mystery never even got to me.I read that the scene where the murderer returns to the apartment and finds Lisa snooping around is apparently a 'classic'. LOL!!! The whole time I couldn't stop but wonder why Jimmy frigging Stewart didn't jump from his chair and limp like crazy to that apartment!!!?!!? All he could do was cling his teeth. Now that's love for you;) Overall, way to many subplots and no real plot. Decent acting. Great sound but poorly-made sets. Bad ending. Bad premise actually. Not Hitchcock's finest moment. Honeslty, it's one of his weakest ones! And just a personal observation that I find rather amusing: If the pianist was heard all the way to Jefferies's apartment, wouldn't any of the other residents ever get pi**ed at him for always playing that piano??;)",6,5,10,9 June 2007
300," 300...one hell of a movie experience - If you know what to expect!
","If you know that '300' is based on a graphic novel, if you know that that comic book itself was directly inspired by true and truly 'inspiration-worthy' events that took place in Greece some 2500 years ago, then you're almost certainly in for a big treat. If, however, you'll resent the sometimes imaginative touches and elements in this movie for not being hardcore historically accurate then I suggest you leave '300' for another day.The rest, hopefully, should be history...and as incredible as the true last-stand at Thermopilae already was, the fact that this movie, as grand and epic as is, for the most part remains surprisingly faithful to the actual facts, is indeed worth a praise. After reading '300' graphic novel series I subjectively conclude that Frank Miller's comic served Mr. Snyder more as a guide, and not as the goal. The movie skillfully uses the rather spartanesquely scant, yet powerfully written comic but also manages to integrate novelties to even further commemorate the legacy that the military state of Sparta has left behind. There's further reading to be found in places like wikipedia and it's more than worth your time...I can only laugh at accusations regarding the movie and current political affairs, but to each his own. What Zack Snyder's '300' managed to do is combine the absolute best of both the pure historical facts (the legacy of Spartans) and historically-inspired fiction (the '300' novels) to bring the mother of war stories to the big screen. He knew exactly how to do it, made the best use of every scene and moments, carefully steered away from pathetic ones, found one hell of a 'Leonidas' and gave the most courageous last-stand in history just the right dose of magic to turn it into a unbelievable and unique tale...whoever knows what the REAL '300' did knows what I'm trying to say...it was them who performed the real magic.A great testosterone movie that surprisingly pays true homage to bravery, honor and glory.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae",9,3,9,31 March 2007
Tarzan," Very overrated
","This movie is nothing special. I like the old Tarzan comics and this movie just didn't do it for me. The only good part in the whole movie is the scene where Tarzan chase the leopard around the trees. The animation there is just awesome, but the rest of the movie lacks charisma. None of the characters are memorable and the scene where the apes play with the pots and pans is a 'Jungle Book' ripoff. Even Phil Collins couldn't help this movie.And did anyone notice the poor quality of colors they used in this movie. This is the only Disney movie that, to me, looked like a cheap cartoon they usually play on some low budget TV network. It was really bad. And it's not just this movie. Check out 'The Whole Nine Yards' or 'Sixth Day' or some other movie I can't think of right now and you'll get the general idea. As if they were using some new cheap cameras that totally ruin the 'magic of colors'. Now there's a technical term for you! I am of course speaking in layman's terms but the point I'm trying to make is that these movies are not watchable. But let's get back to Tarzan. A really bad movie with no climax, a lame villain (he's like the villain in 'Dinosaur') which left me depressed and disappointed and I would not recommend it to anyone.",5,4,10,7 March 2002

Happy Feet," The last 1/3 sadly leaves an unnecessary bitter-sweet flavor
","The first and the second act of the movie (the first being Mumble thinking he's not worthy of staying in his flock, and the second one restoring his self-confidence) were a pleasant surprise to me, since the trailer failed miserably to impress me. Light, fluffy, and funny, 'Happy Feet' succeeds in bringing new atmosphere to the usually 'by-the-book' storytelling in today's animation...and it does so with what could barely be called a plot...but I certainly can't hold that against the movie because it manages to entertain nonetheless, plus the animation looked really nice.There were some moments when I found the musical portion highly annoying, but at others it gave me goose bumps, so I'm pretty evened-out on this element of the movie, although the idea was at least fresh.However the last 20 minutes slow the pace, try to quickly inflict us with a feeling of guilty conscience and remorse (which they do), and then without at least ending what it starts on a high moral note, or any explanations, for that matter, it quickly wraps up the charade. It all feels terribly forced and unnecessary (albeit the topic of human pollution is one that 'shouldn't' be overlooked) and had the movie just glanced at some of those serious topics it would have probably made a greater impact. But in this case I was left pondering if I just saw a light-hearted family movie that unsuccessfully squeezed-in some serious elements, or a failed attempt at a moral lecture that was sadly turned into a joy-ride.",6,1,2,1 April 2007

","This is one of the worst things that has ever come out of Disney animation studios. What a bore. No amusing and witty characters in this one. After the movie I was really depressed because of the ending and the movie in whole.And apparently the whole story is bogus. No matter, in any case this movie really sucks. I remember every Disney movie I have ever seen. There's always something memorable in every single one. Pocahontas (and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'!!!) are like a bad Robert Zemeckis movie.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Much better than the last one
","Well, Spielberg realized that 'The temple of doom' really sucked and luckily returned to the successful formula of the first one. But that's also the main downside to this movie; some scenes are done almost exactly like in 'Raiders'. The scene where Dr. Brody walks into the classroom and all the girls are drooling over Indy is done just like in the first movie and they could have fooled me. But let's get to the good stuff. 1. The dark theme from 'Raiders' is back, but is sadly not heard often. 2. Excellent performance by River Phoenix as the young Indiana Jones. He was truly believable and I was sad that he was not given more screen time as the early part of the movie was really captivating. When he spots the golden cross and tells his friend to go get the professor his eyes look exactly like Ford's. 3. Sean Connery's performance was very memorable and different from his previous and future work; he is believable as the father and makes for some very funny moments in this movie. 4. Probably  many other things I don't remember at the moment but will as soon as I press the 'Now send your comments for approval' button
Ford is great as usual, the special effects are OK and the story is interesting enough (the religion thing was also in 'Raiders')A movie with a truly great cast and a high entertainment value, but lacks an innovative approach to the material. But hey, maybe it's for the better, I certainly didn't want to see another 'Temple of doom'. 8/10",8,1,1,20 March 2002
Back to the Future," An unforgettable experience
","Let me just say this out loud - THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIE FROM MY KID-HOOD!!! So cool, so different, so friggin' awesome. Marty Mcfly, one of the slickest, most energetic and entertaining characters ever brought to movie-life was forever Michael J. Fox's 'Christopher Reeve-Superman' thing, but the price wasn't too high, he's simply irreplaceable in the trilogy. The exact same price-tag is also on Christopher Lloyd's Dr. Emmett Brown, Crispin Glover, and the guy who plays Biff. Don't even know his name, don't even care to, he's just 'Biff'.The music, the special effects, the sets, the Dolorean, heck the idea, and the acting-they're all impeccable. Impeccable. I still write all this after more than 14 years, but something that's usually stamped on Robert Zemeckis's movies is perfection to details and just about everything. Rarely does he fail at this, that's a consistence I admire about him a lot! 'Back To The Future' is still one of his best movies, one of the best movies of the 80's, one of the best sci-fi movies, a true marble, after 20 years it's holding on without even a struggle, and is one of those eternal movies everybody who's into movies will see for sure.9/10 Recommendations: if you don't at least like it I don't believe you:)",9,0,1,30 January 2002
