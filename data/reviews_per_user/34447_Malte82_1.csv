Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Disappointment
","I watched this movie because I found the idea of mixing genres very intriguing (historic drama plus vampire fantasy). However, what annoyed me most is the look of the movie, it's in sepia... terrible! Also, it does not really mix genres. It's mostly an action movie. So do action movie goers get one's money's worth? I personally don't think so, because the action scenes are very exaggerated and unrealistic. In most of the fight scenes Abraham Lincoln behaves as if he was a super hero. I just don't buy it! Benjamin Walker didn't convince me in his role at all, but maybe he was just one victim of the bad script and cinematography. My advice: don't be a victim yourself! Don't watch this movie unless you are really desperate!",2,12,27,3 October 2012
