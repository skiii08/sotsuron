Hereditary," Horror movie?? Maybe Drama
","After reading some reviews, I thought that this movie is one of the best horror movies of all time! And....I WAS WRONG! This is a suspenseful and dramatic movie, that's all. Nothing horror about it.
And the ending....OMG! Terrible!!",4,1,2,14 September 2018
