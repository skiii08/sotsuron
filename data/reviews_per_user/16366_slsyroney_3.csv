Ford v Ferrari," Fun!
","Christian Bale killed it in this movie. Matt Damon was great too. As a racing movie, a bit of a let down but the last race was fantastic. A real nail bitter! The title Ford V. Ferrari is misleading; it really is a story about two guys who love cars, and I really appreciated that. I really loved the family dynamic with Bale's character in this movie especially. Overall, I can see why people would give this movie a perfect score, but for me the writing just makes it fall a little short. But for a biopic, it was fantastic!",8,1,1,14 January 2020
The Irishman," Slow but good message
","Ok so the first 2 acts of this movie are sooo slowwww. If you cut off an hour and a half of this movie it would still be fine. DeNiros constant stuttering and muttering drove me crazy. I get that maybe he was going for realism but dear god it was so boring to watch.Al Pacino was the best in this movie. I loved him. The music I thought was also very good. The VFX were also quite impressive.The 2nd half is when it is actually bearable to watch. The last 10 mins or so were very powerful. The message was fantastic and I loved it. However, the length of this movie killed it and how boring it was :/",6,0,0,14 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Totally was NOT expecting that
","Knowing Waititi and seeing the trailer, I expected this movie to be a comedy with some emotion. After seeing this movie, I saw comedy and emotion equally balanced, emotion even a little higher.The acting in this was CRAZY good. The chemistry between JoJo and Elsa was SO good. I believe this is the first time I've seen either actor in a film and boy did I love them! Yorkie was a great source of comic relief and I found myself smiling every time he appeared on screen. All these young actors were SO good! ScarJo and Rockwell were fantastic as well. Waititi's take on Hitler was hilarious and had me dying.My two favorite scenes was the one with the grenade and the one with the shoes. Great examples of balancing emotion and humor. Also as a history nerd, I thought this movie did a good job balancing the small scale war and the wider scale war too.Overall, this movie will make you laugh till you cry and cry cry for real. I loved this movie would 100% recommend it.",10,1,3,13 January 2020
