Mission: Impossible III," suffers from typical sequel-itis
","This movie suffers from a serious lack of plot-imagination and tries to make up for it with stunt-imagination and shock-and-awe.It failed to impress me. You can't serve up the same slop over and over again with minor variations and hope to get a reaction. There is nothing fundamentally new about MI-3. If you think about it, he's once again trying to save his girl from the bad guy against impossible odds.The Bond series is also plagued with the same malaise, and those guys hope to save the movie by getting box-office stars like Halle Berry to bail it out. They still manage to produce fare that has a little more takeaway than this MI movie series. Only the first MI movie passed muster in my book. But then, I also thought Matrix shouldn't have been a series, and they should've stopped with the first. =shrug= I wish American studios start making movies from good original scripts soon, rather than rely on formula and diving down memory lane to relive past glories. By that I don't mean something totally different and weird , but original enough to keep the audience guessing, and hence enthralled.My sister and I went and watched it for a buck last night, and I guess that's about all I'd pay for this. Fans of the MI series and Tom Cruise might give this more favorable rating.",5,1,2,8 July 2006
