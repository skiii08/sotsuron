Alien 3," Very underrated
","This third installment is often refered to as the worst in the Alien franchise.  The film is dark, serious, dramatic, and emotional.  In other words, it lacks the wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am action of the second film, and it's missing the suspense and mystery of the first movie.  But just because it's different does NOT mean it's bad.  In fact, the dramatic tone of this film is exactly why I thought it was just as good, if not better than the first two.  The only flaw with the film is that it kills off two of the survivors of Aliens right away.  Anyone who goes from watching Aliens right into Alien3 will be upset that the people they came to care about in Aliens are suddenly dead--after living through the excitement of the last film. Once I was over my disappointment, however, I became enthralled with the tone and atmosphere of this movie.  Directed by David Fincher (who later directed 'The game' and 'Fight Club,') the film is extremely moody.  It's dark, somewhat amber-tinted, and very quiet.  There are no guns and no aliens leaping around frantically.Is this such a bad thing?  Did people expect to see Aliens2 instead of Alien 3?  I liked the fact that there were no guns.  I liked the fact that the alien had taken on some characteristics of a dog.  And I liked the fact that Ripley wasn't the same 'Get away from her, you bitch!' Rambo-type woman as she was in the second film.  This was her big send off.  The film is almost a tribute to her--and Weaver's performance is heartbreaking.
As we all know, they filmed a fourth Alien film.  Stay far, far away from Alien: Resurrection.  Watch the first three films and you get a complete trilogy, with a beginning ('Alien' as the introduction), a middle (the excitement and action of the second), and an ending (Alien3 providing the resolution and conclusion).",9,0,2,19 November 2001
Unbreakable," What the ???
","I loved the Sixth Sense, and I was really looking forward to Unbreakable. Maybe that was why I hated it so much--my expectations were way too high. When the movie ended, I turned to the woman next to me and asked 'What the heck was that all about?'  Her response?  'Beats me.'  The movie starts with an interesting premise:  a man lives through a train wreck.  He's the sole survivor, and he doesn't have a scratch on his body.  In pops Samuel Jackson, who tells our hero that he, in fact, IS a 'hero.'  He's like a comic book superhero, he's just never known it.  Yep, you read correctly. He's a superhero.  Then, our 'hero' decides to dress in a trenchcoat and save a kidnapped girl.  Huh? He tromps around, gets the living crap beaten out of him, but still beats the villain because, as the title suggests, he is literally unbreakable.  The movie ends with another 'twist' like the Sixth Sense, but this one is much less effective.  Many people enjoyed this movie.  I guess you either go with it or you don't once Bruce Willis realizes he's a modern day Superman.  I, for one, certainly DID NOT.",1,22,48,25 September 2001
Memento," Comment on some of the Negative Comments
","I've read through many of the comments on IMDB for 'Memento,' and I was surprised at how many of them focused on the 'top 10' argument.  (As in, 'This is a good movie but it shouldn't be in the top 10 of all time.') Well, obviously enough people have voted on this movie at imdb to place it in the top 10, so the whole argument is over.  Done.  Move on!Secondly, some of the 'holes' that people have pointed out can either be explained or are, in my opinion, intentionally unexplainable.  For example, the whole 'if he REALLY had no short term memory, then he wouldn't remember that he had no short term memory' discussion.  Was I the only one that noticed that this argument was the whole point of the movie? SPOILERS!!! I mean, when the film ends and Lenny's memories are brought into question--did his wife really die?  Did he already kill John G?  Was he really Sammy Jenkins?--then I began to wonder if he even really had a memory problem to begin with.  After all, everyone doubted Sammy's memory problems, even Lenny.  In fact, Lenny says to Sammy's wife that Sammy should be able to make new memories.  But HE's Sammy...  It's like his subconscious is trying to tell him that if he really wanted to, he'd be able to make new memories without a problem.  He just doesn't really want to... he's stuck in a world of depression and guilt over what happened.  That's why every once in a while he remembers things that he probably shouldn't have (like the gun in the drawer...knowing the car that Teddy drove so he could write down the license plate number... etc)  Then again, that interpretation could be totally false, too. There's no definitive answer... the movie is built to make you discuss and question everything you've seen.  The BEST thing about Memento is that it DOESN'T explain everything away (a la Vanilla Sky).  It trusts the audience to form its own opinions through intelligent discussions...",10,0,1,9 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Fantastic Interpretation of the Book
","When I read The Fellowship of the Ring last summer, I wondered how it could possibly be made into a film.  It seemed so large and so epic, and yet so simple at the same time.  Then I found out that Peter Jackson, the director of silly horror movies like Dead-Alive, had directed the movie.  I was prepared for a HUGE letdown.  I was completely wrong.  The movie was totally fantastic--visually stunning, unbelievably loyal to the text (with the exception of a few missing characters, none of whom really mattered, and one small change with Arwen), tragic, exciting, sad, and emotional.  Everything an epic film should be.  I've never been in a theatre in which people stood up and cheered--until now, that is.  Go see this movie!!!",10,0,0,20 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Better that the Second, but...
","Okay, first things first:  The Matrix Revolutions is much better than Reloaded.  There is much less dialogue, much more action, and there is NO underground orgy scene (thank GOD).  But, there still feels like something's missing in this 'finale' to the trilogy.(MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD)1)  The beginning of Revolutions is extremely slow.  It takes the movie a good 45 minutes before anything really happens.  There is one great fight between Trinity and an agent that emulates the fights from the first film, but other than that, the beginning is mostly Keannu Reeves stuck in a bland, white train station waiting for the 'train man.'  Uh... okay.2.  Once the war begins, the movie is nothing but action, which for the most part is great.  But sometimes the CGI is so intense that it's hard to tell what's going on.  I wasn't the only one in the theatre that kept asking 'who was that?' and 'what just happened?'3.  The plot is somewhat predictable--yes, there are deaths, and it's not tough to figure out who dies in this movie.  I won't spoil it here, although I'm sure there are other reviews that already have.  But the death scenes themselves are extremely drawn out and melodramatic.  One in particular drags on and becomes a total 'Titanic'-sized good-bye scene that had people laughing more than crying.Overall, this movie is entertaining.  But after the excitement of the action dies off, it becomes more apparent that the sequels really weren't as original as the first Matrix.  They borrow heavily on other science fiction movies, such as Dune and even Aliens.  (Those things the human army wore--did anyone else keep waiting for them to shout 'Get away from her you bitch!'?)My recommendation:  go into this movie expecting some cool action sequences, cheesy dialogue, unintentionally funny moments, and a great final battle scene between Neo and Agent Smith, and you won't be let down.",Null,0,0,6 November 2003
The Shining," A Masterpiece of Horror
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Many critics claim that there were two failures in Stanley Kubrik's career. One was the over-hyped 'Eyes Wide Shut,' which seemed underdeveloped and overacted.  The other was 'The Shining.'  Most critics mentioned the differences between the book by Stephen King and the movie's screenplay. (Jack Torrance was too crazy in the movie, his wife was too wimpy in the movie, the boy was too strange in the movie, the moving hedge animals were missing in the movie, etc, etc).  I think these critics have actually gotten in wrong.  Stephen King should be thanking Kubrik for what he did--he took an average book about the effects of child abuse and turned it into a masterpiece of modern horror.First, let's examine the events in the book.  We learn that Jack Torrance has a bad temper, and that he has been fired for hurting a student.  We also learn that he broke his son's arm once in a fit of rage.  Most of this was done in an alcoholic rage.  Needing money, he moves his family to the Overlook hotel and takes the job of the winter caretaker.  His son, Danny, has visions of horrible things in the hotel:  a blood-stained wall, a hand coming from a bathtub, and the words REDRUM.  Slowly, Jack becomes obsessed with the hotel's past, while strange things begin happening to his son.  A fire hose begins to menace the small boy and the hotel's hedge animals begin to move and 'hunt' him.  He has recurring nightmares about a figure stalking him in the hallways with a bat, telling him repeatedly to 'take your medicine!'  Meanwhile, acting as though he's back off the wagon, Jack becomes convinced that he should kill his family and, quite predictably, turns into the figure in the hallway with the baseball bat.  Only at the end of the novel does Jack snap out of it, rescuing his family from the hotel before it blows up (he forgot to fix the heater in the basement).  (Bear in mind, this is an extremely brief summary of a 300+ page book).
Okay, here are some problems right away with the novel.  One, it's almost downright silly.  Moving hedge animals?  That's not scary, it's almost laughable.  A threatening fire hose?  Not scary.  A blood-stained wall? Seen that on television too many times.  The only true terror from the book comes from room 217 and the woman in the bathtub.  The other problem from the novel is that most of it is told through the child's point of view. His 'shinings' and visions are scary, yes, but they are still childlike.  We don't question if the ghosts exist to Jack or Wendy, we question if they are real for Danny.  Are these the real ghosts of a haunted hotel?  Or are they the ghosts of a traumatized, abused child's mind?Now let's address the movie.  The film begins similarly to the novel. Jack Torrance interviews for a position at the Overlook Hotel.  Meanwhile, his wife discloses to a nurse that her son was once 'injured' by Jack by accident when he was 'still drinking.'  The student from the novel is dropped. Danny begins to have his visions--an elevator opens to release torrents of blood down a hallway.  As the family moves into the hotel, Danny continues to have 'shinings,' such as seeing the two twin girls mutilated in the hallway.  These visions are graphic and haunting.  Meanwhile, Jack begins to have visions--a bartender serves him alcohol, a caretaker tells him to rid of his family.  Danny eventually wanders into room 237--room 217 in the film--, and when Jack goes in, he finds the woman in the bathtub. She appears beautiful, but when he sees her reflection, he realizes she is actually a decomposed body.  (To get into the use of mirrors in the film would require a whole new essay). Eventually, Jack goes insane, stalking his family with an axe, chasing Danny through a maze of hedges.  Wendy runs through the hotel, seeing several ghosts and bizarre visions.  Jack eventually gets lost in the maze andfreezes to death.How is this an improvement on the book?  For one, Kubrick changes the point of view.  The movie is told strictly through Jack Torrance's point of view. We see Danny's visions, but they are much more 'adult.'  The blood streaming down the hallway is much more menacing than a dog-shaped hedge animal. Secondly, Jack himself is much scarier in the movie.  Some people say the character is over the top, but I disagree.  In the book, the repeated 'Take your medicine!' references got old REALLY fast.  Watching Jack Nicholson smile crookedly and say 'Heeeeere's Johnny!' in the movie still gives me the chills.  The bizarre visions that Wendy sees near the film's conclusion are also an added bonus.  While searching for Danny, she sees three different visions.  First, she sees what appears to be a man in a bear costume performing oral sex on a man in tuxedo.  A viewer might be tempted to say 'HUH?', but that is what makes it so frightening to me.  Wendy wouldn't know what the heck was going on, so why should the viewer?  Not knowing makes us as scared as Wendy was at that point.  Then, she sees a man with blood trickling down his forehead.  'Great party, isn't it?' he says.  What party? Who cares!  Like I said before, she would have no idea what was going on...why should we?  Finally, Wendy sees the blood pouring from the elevators, a terrifying image that gave me nightmares the first time I saw it.Overall--and since I've been writing far too long already--the movie is much better than the book.  The novel seemed silly and juvenile, while the film seemed subtle, morbid, terrifying, and very, very adult.  Some say Kubrick didn't tie up all of the loose ends.  I say he left out enough information to bring the audience back for more.",10,2,3,25 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Yes, it's different from the book, BUT it's still great!
","I am so tired of reading comments about how 'awful' this film is because it 'destroys Tolkien's vision.'  THIS ISN'T TOLKIEN'S VISION--IT'S PETER JACKSON'S!  Yes, the Two Towers strays from the literature in several key places.  Most notably, Sam and Frodo don't go to Mordor in the book, Aragorn doesn't fall off a cliff, and backstory of Arwen and Aragorn's romance isn't discussed, Shelob the spider is missing, and there are no elves fighting at Helm's Deep (speaking of which, the battle in the book is quite short--but it manages to take up the last thirty minutes of the movie.)OKAY, so it's different.  But how can you say the film is 'awful?'  The movie is absolutley beautiful and breathtaking, and some scenes look like gothic, epic, biblical portraits.  The scene in which Gandalf the White comes down the hill to battle the Orcs at Helm's Deep, for example is wonderful.  His entire army backlit by his powerful white light, it's such an image of hope that it gave me chills.And Gollum is terrific in this movie.  The scenes in which he argues with himself were done superbly.  His character as a whole sets up suspense and humor.  He is simply the most realistic CGI character ever created.I think it is fair to say that you can feel frustrated that Peter Jackson changed some of the material and some of the characters.  But how can you hate such a powerful, beautiful film just because it's different??",Null,0,0,9 November 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Fantastic and Magical
","For the first fifteen minutes of this movie, I was sure I had made a mistake.  I was totally caught off guard, and the quick-cutting style of Luhrman made me dizzy and almost nauseous.  But then, something magical happened.  Nicole Kidman came on the screen, and the movie suddenly switched gears.  It slowed down a bit (just a bit, but enough), and a love story began.  Familiar songs, such as 'Your Song' filled the theater.  And suddenly, without warning, I fell in love with the movie.  I couldn't believe the change from my initial reaction to my end reaction.  I think some people absolutely hated this movie because they couldn't shake that initial reaction, whereas I sort of fell into the fantasy of the whole experience.  Yes, it's silly that they're singing modern songs.  Yes, it's silly that, at one point, they appear to float among the clouds while pixie dust sprinkles around them.  But I accepted these as images, almost as metaphors, to help explain the excitement and beauty of the love story.  To make a long story short, ignore the bad reviews and give the movie a chance--and stick around past the first 15 minutes--and you'll see that it's truly unforgettable.",10,0,1,22 October 2001
From Hell," Extremely Gory and Dark
","I think a distinction should be made about why this movie is getting such universal praise from critics.  I think visually, the film is stunning.  It sets the perfect tone, and it never lets the audience go or relax.  It's tense, it's beautiful, it's well-acted, and it almost plays like a long, opium-induced hallucination.  I think this is why the film is receiving praise.  As far as the story goes, it's somewhat bland and extremely graphic.  The film was hard to enjoy because it was so dark and gory, and some of the death scenes were quite brutal.  I heard numerous gasps of displeasure in my theatre.  So, if you like to see a film to see a director's vision recognized, then go see From Hell.  If you're squeamish, stay far, far away.",7,0,1,22 October 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Will Make You Think Twice About Mental Illness
","My aunt is schizophrenic.  For most of my life, I've always just known her as 'crazy' Aunt Kathy.  She talks to herself, she mumbles a lot, and she often talks to people that aren't there.  I never truly understood her illness, and I simply shrugged it off most of the time. 
After seeing this phenomenal movie, I can finally understand what she goes through on a daily basis.  The film presents the hallucinations and real-life events of John Nash in a way that allows the viewer to understand why a schizophrenic would have difficulty distinguishing what's real and what's not.  (SPOILERS}...  When Nash first learns that certain people in his life, such as his roommate/best friend and his secret spy boss, don't really exist, he struggles with the realization that he's been hallucinating.  Later in the film, when he stops taking his meds and these people reappear, it's completely easy to see how Nash must have felt relieved in some way.  'I was so afraid you weren't real,' he says, even though we as the audience know that they weren't.  This might all sound confusing if you haven't seen the film, but all I can say is prepare yourself.  It will touch and educate you deeply, espcecially if you know anyone battling mental illness.",Null,0,1,14 February 2002
Love Actually," Love Actually? Or Non-Realistically?
","To sum up this movie in a brief review probably wouldn't give it justice. It's a cute movie about all different kinds of love--love between a sister and her brother, love between married couples, love between language barriers, love between fathers and sons, and even first, more innocent 'love' between 11-year old children.  I have read some comments on this board that the movie was unrealistic and even offensive in its use of nudity and language.  **Spoilers** Well, some of the situations are a little far-fetched, which can be somewhat frustrating in a movie that more often than not nails the realism of love. For example, two people can fall in love despite the fact that they don't understand a single thing the other is saying?  I'm not sure that would be love--lust, maybe, but not love.  And a man travels to America so he can improve his love life and instantly hits it off with not one, not two, but FOUR American girls at the first bar he goes too--all because of his English accent.  Somewhat doubtful.  But as I stated, the movie definitely touches more realistic aspects of love, too.  For example, a middle-aged man is tempted by his younger secretary.  A young American girl realizes that her crush cannot be fulfilled because of her obligations to her brother.  A man falls in love with his best friend's girl, but achingly realizes he can never act on those feelings.  All of these situations rang true to me, and I found these storylines to be touching and even sad.But the thing that really touched me about this movie was the speech that Hugh Grant gave at the beginning.  And I think that speech summed up the entire 2 hour movie in 2 minutes.  The scene takes place in an airport, and we watch as people greet friends, relatives, and lovers.  Hugh Grant begins to talk about how all you read about these days is that the world is filled with hatrid and greed.  But when he thinks about comments like that, he thinks about the airport, and all he sees is love.  He mentions that when 9/11 happened, the phone calls that were made from inside the buildings were made from love, not hate.  And he realizes that love, actually, is all around us.  That speech gave me the chills--and after the movie was over, you realize that this speech is the message of the movie.  Maybe it's not all meant to be totally realistic.  Maybe some aspects of the movie ARE fanciful and far-fetched.  But when you look at the movie as a whole, it's all about love being everywhere, and how can that offend anyone???",Null,0,2,18 November 2003
Vanilla Sky," Worst Movie of the Year
","This was the worst movie I saw last year, and I saw some doozies (Corky Romano, Freddy Got Fingered...)  That acting, directing, editing, and soundtrack to this film are all horrible.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.Let's start with the plot.  Normally, I enjoy somewhat confusing movies, whether they explain themselves in the end (Memento) or leave you wondering 'Huh?' (Mulholland Falls).  But THIS movie just made me angry.First of all, Tom Cruise's character was an arrogant, cocky, rich kid that the audience immediately disliked.  He used women, he never really worked all that hard, and everything in life had come easy for him.  For the first 15 minutes, Tom Cruise simply walks around and flashes his annoying smile.
Then Penelope Cruz comes into the picture, and suddenly we're thrown into a confusing mess of a story.  Is Cameron Diaz really dead?  Is Penelope Cruz actually Cameron Diaz?  Did Tom Cruise kill somebody?  Did the Phantom of the Opera loan his mask to Tom Cruise?  Did Kurt Russell suddenly forget his daughter's names?   (If you think these questions are confusing, they're ACTUAL questions posed by the plotline....so if you think they sound dumb then you must agree to stay away from this film!)  The plot literally folds in on itself numerous times, but when it finally offers an answer to all the confusion, you just want to throw your popcorn at the screen and yell obscenities at the writers.  The 'explanation'--if you can call it that--is completely absurd.Then we have the acting.  I've never been so annoyed with Tom Cruise before in my life.  He needs to stop playing over confident characters who are suddenly challenged a la Jerry McGuire, Maverick, etc....  After the accident that disfigures his face, Tom's acting takes a nosedive into bizarroland.  Wearing a latex mask, he stalks around nightclubs, muttering about regaining his life, blah blah blah....  He must have had his eyes wide shut when he received this script.  Then we have Penelope Cruz.... If she said 'Open your Eyes!' one more time, I would have left the theatre.  Her character was a cardboard figure that you couldn't possibly understand, and it never seemed clear why Cruise was so madly in love with her character. She seemed strange and stale to me.  And Cameron 'do you believe in God' Diaz....maybe it was just the writing, but her character was so filled with 'crazy girlfriend' stereotypes--right down to the stalking scene at the party--that I cringed every time I saw her.I could go on and on about the inappropriate soundtrack--why Radiohead and REM appear in a movie like this is beyond me--and they horrible editing (so quick and incomprehensible...Look!  There's Cameron Diaz's face saying Boo! There's Penelope Cruz in a wedding dress on the bed!  Did you miss that? Oh who cares!!!).  Bottom line--if this review made no sense to you, then you have a small perception of what the film's like.  Stay away from this movie!!!",1,35,87,3 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Stunning Conclusion
","The Return of the King is a visually and emotionally stunning conclusion to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Not only are the special effects amazing, but the story develops to a heart-pounding, emotional climax.The characters all come full circle in this movie.  The most notable character in the Return of the King, surprisingly, is Sam.  Sean Astin does an amazing job of showing loyalty, fear, surprise, and hope all with just his eyes.  Although I'm sure his acting will go unnoticed by the Academy, he definitely deserves some recognition for his skills here.  Elijah Wood once again performs magnificently as Frodo continues to spiral downward toward despair.  If you watch the Fellowship of the Ring before this, you can really see the emotional impact of his journey and the toll it has taken. All of the characters are given special attention here, and they all receive satisfying storylines.  (With the exception of Sarumon, who is curiously missing in this installment).I am sure a lot of people will point out differences from the text.  Yes, there were a few, but I was pleased with the changes.  Shelob the spider finally makes her appearance--and the suspense and special effects that accompany her are jaw dropping.  The conclusion is a little different as well--AND yes, it does seem a little long.  The movie continues after the climax at Mount Doom for another thirty  minutes or so, but in my opinion it's all necessary.  I for one would have been upset if the movie ended abruptly after Mount Doom and we didn't get a chance to see where life was taking these characters that we have grown to love now that their respective journeys have ended.Overall, this movie was fantastic.  The acting, the story, the special effects, and the devotion to the imagery and genious of Tolkien were amazing.  I hope the Academy finally gives Peter Jackson--and this movie--the awards they deserve!",10,0,0,18 December 2003
