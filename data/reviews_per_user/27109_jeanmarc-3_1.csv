The Blair Witch Project," A Short that is a Wannabe Full-Length Feature Movie
","Small budget cults: Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Blair Witch Project... NOT! The Blair Witch Project is the example of the short that is a wannabe full-length movie. It is 75 minutes long and still, it seems soooo long and stretched. So stretched that I felt seasick because of that fake amateur movie shooting style. Even my little 6-year-old cousin is better with the video camera. I trusted and respected Sundance until now: what's the hype around that film-school-project-like short that included all the take-outs... Or were they take-outs? I usually like movies that nobody does and have a very versatile taste in genres and periods. This movie is boring, long (and yet so short in length) and does not carry ANY cinematographical value, except maybe an extensive collection of not-to-dos.",2,0,2,2 August 1999
