The Mask," Wild, cartoonish fun with Jim Carrey
","I don't know how anyone could see this film and not love it. Much as Michael Keaton did with Beetlejuice, Carrey maniacally brings alive the role of Stanley Ipkiss, a down and out loser, who is transformed into a cartoonish superhero once donning a magical mask. Ipkiss uses his newfound powers to woo the heart of Tina (Cameron Diaz) and save the city from an evil gangster. Although Diaz is totally overshadowed by Carrey, his dog and the wild special effects, she still makes an impression. The clever story line is a perfect fit for Carrey's off-the-wall humor. The movie moves at a nice clip with lots of funny little moments to keep you smiling.",10,1,1,11 March 1999
