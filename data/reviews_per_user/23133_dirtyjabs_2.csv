The New World," It was okay
",We started watching this movie because of history class. So John smith goes to this land and finds Rebecca/Pocahontas and ends up having a kid with her. The movie was very slow and but the graphics was actually really good. The movie was super slow so I feel like it got boring at times. Or one of those movies where you have to push through. The age difference on the movie wasn't as bad as actual real life. They literally seemed almost the same age in the movie but in history they were 11 years apart. I liked the plot twist at the end were she ended up dying and were she was playing with her kid but it was her spirit not really her. Also how she adapted to the new workd when she came to it. One thing I didn't like was how slow the movie was it was hard to stay awake. I thought the movie was alright but it could've been more thrilling or exciting to keep the watchers engaged. Oh one other thing I like is the fighting part that was crazy.,5,0,1,30 August 2018
The Alamo," I liked this movie a lot and best one so far for my history through film class
",This movies was super good to me and we watched it through history through film class. I liked the movie a lot and it kept you on your toes for sure the acting was super good but I cannot understand why this movie is such a low rating. The guy who didn't ever miss a shot and shot that other dudes shoulder pad off was pretty cool. So that's how you know he was a good shot because back then those sights sucked. When the guy started acting like a leader too was good and overall I liked the movie a lot. It was a good action movie and had good fight scenes. Made you nervous to see what would happen next.,9,0,1,11 October 2018
