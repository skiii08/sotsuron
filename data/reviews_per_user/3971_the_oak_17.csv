The King's Speech," Powerful movie
","The Kings Speech moved me strongly. I used to have a pretty bad stutter problem, so I could really understand George. You could ask what all the fuss is about. It's only about a man who has a hard times pronouncing words, and also the royal house is so distant. Why should we care and why should this story be told? I think the story is relevant because it is very basic. George wants his father to love him, but every time he opens his mouth, he proves what a failure he is. Still, we can see he is a decent man. I liked that. I also liked Elizabeth. They have a happy marriage and wonderful kids, and it is of great comfort to the viewer as well as to George himself. Geoffrey Rush plays an unconventional speech therapist. He is from a different walk of life, a con artist, but they eventually develop a friendship that carries the movie to the end. That is when George has to declare war on Nazi Germany. Broadcasted to the entire civilized world. You know the rest and I did, too. But still it touched me to the bone.",10,0,1,9 December 2012
The Equalizer," A good man removes bad people
","I liked this movie. It feels right. It does not feel meaningless, because it teaches us something about how we can chose to live. It speaks about how we can show kindness and be helpful to people we meet and people we know and people we hardly don't know. It also gives us hope that bad people will not win. That being good is worthwhile.",8,1,1,28 January 2019
Source Code," Gripping sci fi that leaves a good feeling
","I was skeptical. Time loops have been explored very well in many Star Trek episodes through the years, and I expected some commercialized version, with loud action and little drama.I was wrong.On the surface, the film is about trying to find a terrorist on board a train. Gyllenhaal plays a military helicopter pilot killed in action. They hook him up to an advanced sci-fi machine enabling them to put him into the mind of one of the passengers for 8 minutes before a bomb destroys the train. His task is to find the terrorist. It is very exciting.Very early on, I felt the chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan. Love always gets to you. I was full of wonder. It is like the most incredible thing you could imagine. To live 8 minutes over and over, and being able to connect with people. Tell them what you really want to tell them. Make them happy. Especially a girl you really like. This is what makes the whole movie tick. It reminded me of Groundhog day. There was the same sense that I am being told something very important here.While I was watching, I was thinking about my own life. How do I spend my time? The thought came to me that life is like a source code, and every moment is a chance to do something good.. Only thing is that we only have one chance. Because moments go by. But there is this beautiful song by the late Norwegian song writer, Alf Proysen, saying that tomorrow is a new day with blank pages and thumbtacks.I don't have to say much more about the movie.It spoils everything if you haven't seen it. Just to say that the main character is a good guy, and he gets close to at least 3 people during the movie. It all helps to suck us into the drama and the suspense.I can safely say this movie made my day better.",Null,0,1,19 November 2011
The Ring," Almost as scary as Blair Witch Project
","This movie scared me pretty good. I would say that the beginning of the movie is nicely done,really setting a creepy standard. But then it settles down, and we get somewhat of a deeply disturbing detective story as the heroine tries to get to the bottom of the mystery before her time is up.The last 10 minutes will have you shaking and coldsweating. First the director offers us a happy ending, then a sudden descent, and we are left with a sense that it was pure evil with little redemption at the end. The part where a horse runs amok aboard a ferry is scary. I didnt see the Japanese original version, but if it is better than this one, then there is no way around seeing it as well.",Null,1,2,14 March 2004
Inglourious Basterds," I could only watch 30 minutes of this terrible movie
","I suspected this movie to be really bad and racist, so I have avoided it at all costs. Then a friend of mine said it was very good, so I borrowed it from him. I also read Roger Eberts review, because they are often accurate. But he gave it 4 stars, so I suspect it is a jew thing, because the film it total crap. Needless to say, I didn't watch the whole movie. The first scene where an ss officer interrogates a french farmer, was good, but then it all turned awful, and Brad Pitt and some really lame and un-likable guys smashed in the skull of a brave nazi officer. This is a disgrace for all those who died in the war, on all sided and no matter what race. Avoid at all costs.",1,17,30,25 September 2010
Lords of Dogtown," Bad boys who were good on the bottom
","I was intrigued by the rawness of this movie. How the young boys lived for surfing, then turned to skate boarding when the new type of wheel was invented. It was touching to see how they struggled at home, how they found meaning in skating and in friend ship and having something together that was on the side of society. Then fame came, and I must say Jay, played by Emile Hirsch, was a bit intimidating. He didn't seem to give a damn, and I didn't like the way he stole Stacy's girlfriend, although I liked him better later in the movie, because he never gave in to fame and he never sold out. Late on in the movie we saw that things just turned out the way they had to, and that was comforting. In the end, the movie left me with a good feeling, even though one of them died from brain cancer. I really liked how Skip kept on making boards, but his shop being taken over by someone who knew how to run a business, and I liked the end scene, where the boys reunited in the empty swimming pool, grudges forgotten, just having a good time. It touched me, and I was left with a feeling that I had witnessed the birth of a new youth culture. We all know how trend setting it became and all that developed from it.",8,1,2,11 October 2014
12 Angry Men," great classic movie
","This movie is shot inside one single room, where the 12 chosen jury men try to decide if the defendant is guilty or not. It stars a great Henry Fonda trying to defend the boys life against the prejudice of many of the jury men.  J. L Cobb is magnificent as an angry man who effortlessly ignores any argument that the defendant shouldnt 'fry' in the chair. But as the film evolves, we learn that he has some built up anger towards society and that failure in life leads him to act the way he does. When he collapses in tears, muttering the words, not guilty, I had a tear in my eyes. Ronald Emmerich could never have made this. Its great.",Null,0,1,27 September 1999
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," This film is a disgrace
","I have been a fan of Schwarzenegger for many years, and I have even money on him becoming president at odds 500/1. However, his last good film was True Lies. After this he had made a lot of garbage, probably being topped off with the enigma that is Terminator 3. What do you get when you have a lame script, a mediocre director and a lead actor that is not as hip as he used to be? The answer is a lame film. Another viewer rated the scene where he gets his clothes off a homosexual stripper a good one. I think it was very stupid, and totally destroyed any credibility that the terminator had built up in the first two outings. The rise of the machines and the almost total destruction of human kind is not a subject to me made fun of, and it is very sad that they did not understand this when they made T3. The T3 script is a mess. It is as if the script for Terminator 2 was a vase but it fell to the floor and broke and then a group of retards tried to glue the pieces together. I am a fan of Nick Stahl, and he was in my opinion one of the few that did a good job here. This is just very sad.",1,11,20,3 April 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," T-2000 fights the T-1000
","Arnold Schwarzenegger enters the scene naked, and he proceeds to ask a tough biker to give him his clothes, his boots and his motorcykle. The biker looks at him and stumps his cigar on Arnold's chest. A few broken bones later Arnold has new clothes and a cool vehicle. Schwarzenegger was problably born into this world to be in this movie. James Cameron knows this. Great entertainment. Great violence. Just great.",Null,0,0,16 January 1999
Collateral," Tom Cruise beyond redemption
","Tom Cruise is Vincent, a hit man who through a traumatic childhood failed to develop some elements integral in most humans. He hires Max, a taxi driver, to drive him around LA to do contract killings. For 12 years Max has been lying to himself about taxi driving part time while saving up money to start a limousine company. This is a good film. Vincent has greyish beard and hair and is very brutal. He is not to be saved, but the film leaves us with hope that dawn finds Max to be an improved and upgraded man.Michael Mann has directed a movie with an existential theme. Tom Cruise sements his place as Hollywoods Nr1.",Null,0,0,6 November 2004
Django Unchained," Captivating, but unmemorable
","I found the movie to be well made. The camera and the sound is good, with many nice effects and interesting combinations. It is all very animated and arranged. I like the actors as well. The problem with the movie is that it is very black and white, very violent and cartoon-like. You don't really care what happens, or if you care slightly, after it's all over, you know it wasn't real, so it doesn't matter. This is pure escapism and does nothing to make the world a better place or to make us reflect and maybe reevaluate. It appeals to the worst in us too much. But I don't think Tarantino is capable of nothing else.",5,0,3,17 February 2013
Event Horizon," An OK science-fiction flick
","Event Horizon starts out great with a dark, gloomy atmosphere,and then Sam Niell freaks out, and they start to imagine things.It gets even darker, and then Sam Neill (strange, now his nameis inversed) is blown to pieces together with his belovedportal. Well, well, this is not Star Trek, it is much darker,more violent and Sam Neill is blown to pie",Null,0,0,2 June 2000
Saw," Bad acting and uninteresting characters
","I thought Saw was a bit like Jaws 2 for me, because I really could not care less who died or survived. The two men being kept captive inside a room that looks like a public toilet might both be the killer. One is a doctor and the other a photographer. Or the killer might be Danny Clover who plays the detective. Or maybe the killer is the somewhat retarded janitor at the hospital were the doc works? The plot lines are confusing, and when the docs wife and daughter are held hostage, they scream and act like hysteria is the only response there is. Kill them and get it over with I say.I do not know why they make crap like this. I suggest you rent the German movie Das Experiment, it is far superior.",3,3,5,13 March 2005
Groundhog Day," 19 out of 21 students liked it
","I showed this movie to my secondary school English class, and it was a success. Only two of them didn't like the movie. They thought it was boring and repetitive! The other 19 thought it was a nice message about how we should strive to become better human beings and that being good is what ultimately makes us happy.Some of the students thought the best parts of the movie was when Phil Connors killed himself in different ways, others thought it was the scene in the restaurant where Phil tells Rita that he lives the day over and over and demonstrates it by showing that he knows everything about everyone in the restaurant. Yet others liked the scene where he tells Rita how he loves her and she said: did you say anything?This movie has something for everyone, but really it is deeply philosophical and touching.",10,3,6,17 April 2010
Die Hard," die hard in a sky scraper
","This movie is undeniably an intense action roller-coaster. Hans Gruber and his group of 'terrorists', seize control over the Nakatami corporations sky scraper to get their hands on the 600 million dollars worth of 'stuff' in the Nakatami vault. This is on christmas eve, and God wouldn't let villains get away with that, would he? of course not, because New York cop John McClane, has come to visit his wife, who works for the Nakatami corp. The corporation is holding a party for its employees, and when the terrorists barge in on the party, McClane conveniently is out of sight in one of the offices. So you know what happens next, its a lone cops struggle against a pack of no good germans. The germans are of course stereotyped, with blond hair and blue eyes, and a sense for detail planning. In fact, the whole movie is all about stereotypes, the FBI agents are depicted as morons, the black cop outside is neglected by his superiors etc. Other than a few discusting features, Die Hard is good fun.",Null,0,0,19 September 1998
The Wrestler," It's a hard life - find happiness where you can
","I liked this movie. There are many reasons. One is that we get so close to Randy. It becomes so realistic that we start to identify with him.I was surprised by that. What we see is that he is gentle. The same with the other wrestlers. They seem like good and friendly guys. At least I was surprised. At the same time, we learn that he is lonely. He struggles. In one scene Randy and a few other worn out, old time-heroes sit and sign autographs and sell DVD's. It's a sad sight. This also surprised me. So there is this two-fold surprise in the movie.Another reason I liked the movie, is that he tries hard to find some happiness. There is a touching love story, and as we have already started to have sympathy with Randy, we start to feel the same for Cassidy. She is a local stripper, played by Marissa Tomei. She is so beautiful, and life is hard for her too, so we really hope that it will work out for them. I think Rourke and Tomei have good chemistry. Randy also tries to make it right with his daughter, who he has neglected. I think Evan Rachel Wood also a good choice for the role. The only thing that I can point my finger on, is the very predictable way Randy blew his last chance. I felt the daughter was too strict, almost as if she just had to follow the script.A third reason I liked the movie is Mickey Rourke. I felt like I could identify more with Randy knowing the struggles Rourke has had in his private life. Not being judgemental. The Ram has his reasons, and I am sure Rourke had his. We all have.A final reason is the ending. It is a relief that movies don't have to follow a certain formula. You could argue that this film has it's own formula that it has to follow, but at least it is a rare one.I recommend The Wrestler. It is 1,5 hours well spent.",Null,1,1,17 November 2011
Arrival," Beautiful movie with a heart
","The Arrival has no shooting and explosions, the soul of the movie is beyond that in my opinion. Rarely have I seen a movie that resonates so deeply with longings and wishes of my soul. I am a huge fan of science fiction, especially Star Trek. I prefer it to Star Wars because Star Trek is about the human condition. If you know what I am talking about, I am sure you are going to love The Arrival.",10,2,13,14 January 2017
