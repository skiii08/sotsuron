Requiem for a Dream," This is a powerful and great simple story, but the material is too spare to be great.
","Harry Goldfarb is a not a bad guy, he has many redeeming qualities just the wrong dream. He cares about his mother, has a nice good looking girlfriend that likes him, and at least one friend. And we see those redeeming qualities in scenes that are too short, and maybe a little too pat. OK, this is the scene where he shows us that he is caring son, this is the scene where...that's how the scenes ultimately come off; striped to the bone of most nuances of humanity and as a vehicle to move the story along. I don't like Leto's work much, but it is still difficult to blame his performance and not the script's abridgment in this movie. One could almost sense Aronovky struggling with the limits of the budget, but that's still not an excuse for the underwritten quality of the scenes in this film. When you're making something this powerful, you go to the United States Department of Health and Human Services or NIDA for the extra cash to shoot three or four more scenes. Consider the following scene. Marion and Harry go to have a wild time, off drugs, if we can imagine that, on the Atlantic city boardwalk. It is important for us to see them bonding while not on drugs, since only then when they do commit that unpardonable sin to the self, we can fully empathize with each of them. They ride the Farris wheel, then go grab a hot dog, and after that end up on the roof like they did in the film. A sequence, and not individual scenes no lees. Aronovsky would have done well spending some time in humanizing the characters further before unleashing their devastating fall. Before you tear it down you have to build it up. If one hasn't built all of the relationships and the characters up before tearing them down, then there really isn't much to tear down. Our emotions are continually obligated to grind and shift from gear to gear following the choices and actions of the characters, instead of cruising easily in automatic.Furthermore, Requiem, with its balls out creativity, relies too much on those same special effects for emotional substance which should have been created with more action and perhaps dialog. That kind of creativity can only underline what is already there, not create it by its presence. It seems to me the kind of special effect shots Aronovsky uses play best when they are part of a cohesive symphony rather than an elongated short story. This is a powerful and great simple story, but the material is too spare to be great. This is a great film for Aronovsky. Standing on the shoulders of the visuals of his mostly unmatchable student film Pie, Requiem explodes with raw energy and socially attempts and succeeds to some degree to undue as someone has written, :'...everything that Tarantino has done to make drugs glamorous.' It is a great little story, and a very good film. All it needed to be great are the few things that I talk about. 20/20 hindsight is a wonderful thing, but judging from his work on Pie, and now this film, cutting his story aesthetic toward minimalism when it doesn't exactly serve the content might be ingrained in this director. If I am right, time will tell if and how his films will mature.",7,0,1,25 January 2006
Ali," The film needed a broader scope, and a much, much bigger vision.
","Mann's film was respectful to the champion, nothing more. Most all of the mainstream critics got it right, the film was much more like a funeral procession than the encapsulation of the life of the most dynamic sports figure in history.Michael Man's film falls short in many respects. I remember the meeting between Bundini Brown and Ali as it was orchestrated in the film as something primary in Ali's story, since its placement so early on in the film and just the importance that the director chose to give that event...nothing could be further from the truth.Thomas Hauser's biography would not have been a bad template for this film. Where was Ali throwing his Olympic gold medal into a flowing river? Renting a bus and driving to Florida in order to torment Sunny Liston in the middle of the night before he became champion? At one time at the height of his popularity, Ali said of himself, 'More people know me than Jesus Christ.' He may have been right. As a reviewer noted, Mann succeeded in making Ali smaller than life.Spike Lee has stated that When Will Smith came to him and asked, 'Spike, I need you to expand your vision for this film,' Lee knew he wasn't going to get the job. Interestingly, Man's film does play in a similar tone to Malcolm X. It was said by Lee also that Man's people scouted all of the same locations that he used in X. I'm not sure that Lee would have brought anything earthshaking to the film, but he would have spiced it up.The film needed a broader scope, and a much, much bigger vision. And if the budget for some reason couldn't contain the scope, than the correct vision could have been enough to propel the film into the stratosphere to which it naturally belonged.",4,1,2,25 November 2005
Stop-Loss," Stop-Look...
","..at the fine print. If Stop-loss is actually in the contract when the soldiers enlist or sign up for their tour or however it works, which some people on this website are saying, then there is no film. Doesn't Sgt. King say 'Me and the President had a contract?' Isn't the whole idea that it is unlawful for the president to yank them back? The following review, then, is for the film in a world which Stop-loss is unlawful...This film has two problems, but I did enjoy it. It got my heart involved, which is what a good film is suppose to do. One of the things anyway. I cared. The story made sense. I felt for those guys. The camera is too close on everyone from the very beginning, which forces the images and people down the viewer's throats instead of keeping back a bit and letting us get to know the characters before we can accept them at so close a level. This is important for a filmmaker to get, because, well, it's important. All great directors understand this. The hand-held stuff is a bit overdone, and needed to find its place.You can't really blame the screenwriter for the ending, but let's blame them anyway. Can't blame them because it is feasible, but, isn't art suppose to seek some higher truth? Isn't that the point, after all, and not just settle for what is? After looking the Rico Rodriguez character in his eyes and shaking his hand Sgt. King still goes back to war. Hm. Feasible, but not really art. He could have made a good case for going to Canada or Mexico, and justified that. That would have been a better ending. **** the president indeed.",8,5,12,1 April 2008
Friday Night Lights," Inocuous, ineffective film. They know what the're doing.
","Apparently this is a very hard film to make well. It very well maybe an impossible film to make well. I haven't read the book, but by all serious accounts it by and large dismisses and does not articulate the main argument in the book. Impossible for two reasons: It would take an Oliver Stone in his Midnight Express devotional mood to make it, and apparently not Grazier and Berg. Is being stuck in the realities of Football Texas as bad as a Turkish prison? No, but at least there you know you are in prison. In the realities of this film you do not realize significantly the quality of that which binds you, which is the failure of this film. In the end it can't have it both ways. To have all of the expectant beats of a traditional sports movie, and have the desired ironic effect. You get exited as you watch this film by all of the sounds and reactions, and those realities aren't shaped with irony by the screenwriter. Can they be? Very tricky to do I think. In the end we are suppose to come away with... is an insurance salesman, so and so is has twins, they lost the football game...and what? Everyone in this film lost, even the likable coach who was the inadvertent orchestrator of this institutionalized brutality that we have been conditioned to accept as normal so those unfortunate 'normal' people who are everywhere can get there anger out by first investing their emotions in, then watching young men, so unlike themselves, time has proved, bludgeon themselves every week. Oh, now they cash in on the fact and we are reminded that it's a true story. That surely has to give it some more credibility. Did you know...this actually happened...Oh, oh, the critics lauded the film, and it made money, oh, oh, I like it when I touch it cuz she moan a l'il bit/ Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a l'il bit. Chingy knows where it's at and he says it. These filmmakers hide and distort it pretty well. They might be 'Gettin' it' in their personal lives, but on screen, well its a different matter altogether isn't it. A really a muddled effort and message. Impossible to make maybe also because of the economics of film. Who would pay to see one of the sacred cows of American culture (football) beaten and demolished on screen? I would, maybe you would too, but unfortunately not enough people to pay for the film and let the people at Universal keep their jobs, or so they timorously believe. What a great film that would have been! Hard to write well, impossible to make, but at least worth the work and effort. You see you have to hate it and enjoy it at the same time both in traditional ways the filmmakers believe. So you get the watered down bittersweet Koolaid to sip on. It won't kill you, but might make you wonder, hopefully at the duplicity of film's meretricious, ineffective creators. Hollywood's sharp understanding of the economics of the lowest, common, safe economic denominator time after time. The false thin facade of Grazier, Berg, and co. that if it has the veneer of truth that it's all good. They know what their doing.The irony here is, though, that I think the people involved were considering and are considered being involved in a 'cutting edge' non commercial venture film, because this film is not intrinsically commercial. Go figure. In which case they just didn't have the know how to do it right, or perhaps their ideological baggage kept them from seeing the correct path because I think they think they made a great or at least a good, maybe even a very good 'against the grain' film. Probably an amalgamation of everything.",1,0,3,3 May 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," ...pretty good film....
","Chronicles of Narnia is pretty good film. It does seems to loosen up a bit in the second act, but overall the tale and its execution does manage, at times, to amaze. All the kids played their parts well, and I especially liked the performance that James McAvoy gave as the faun; one can tell that he is an exceptional stage actor immediately. The only other faults that I found with the film were that the editing could have been more generous at times, holding on a shot or two for an extra beat here and there to further the effect of the image and the pacing. And the backgrounds, especially toward the end of the film, all have strange saturation with odd artificial hues. I don't know if this is usually done with the theory of making it more appealing to kids, but my eyes didn't like it. They were either over saturated with the wrong values, or were the wrong mixtures of reds, blues and greens. In light of excellence, one has to consider a few other things. Like why didn't the battle climax scene, which was pretty good, elevate the film to the level of true spectacle? And as another reviewer wrote, as soon as the prophesy of the destiny of the children becomes known, they loose any sense of self-determination and events happen to them not because of them. There are answers to these questions, but perhaps they demand a larger forum than a capsule review. Suffice is to say, I think, that the film holds together despite these imperfections, and, as a third reviewer wrote, 'Bring on Prince Caspian.'",9,0,0,7 January 2006
Superbad," Supersad
","I don't know why I don't like this film. I mean, it's about two guys who are long time friends and want to get laid. And it doesn't turn out to be that hard for them because the girls like them in this film. I still don't know why I have antipathy for this film, but it just makes me sad. Maybe because that guy was so angry through the whole film and their relationship was kind of weak, even though they realized they loved each other. Co-dependent, OK, I just didn't like this film. Where is the center of good in it? Nowhere. So they were co-dependent. So that nice looking chic wanted to get with the mean guy, OK, OK. Sometimes girls go for outspoken angry personalities. That's OK. I understand that. But why didn't I like this film? I guess it's everything else. Life doesn't' seem like this. This is an escapist fantasy and not funny at all. It is not a dramedy but a drama it seems. What's the film's meaning? What does it mean? For me, it wasn't a fun ride, just made me kind of sad and I watched it with not a little contempt in my heart. That can't be a good thing.",1,18,34,21 October 2008
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," What an awesome site of resistance.
","Was this movie entertaining? Yes. Did everything work? Yes. And perhaps that's the problem with it. The fact that we don't see anything the matter with it's principles, its presuppositions on which it builds in order to make us laugh and feel. These people are living 'the good life,' wouldn't you say? A young, healthy advertising agent and a columnist in the fabulous New York City. They make two simultaneous immoral, crusty bets and don't suffer for it. Instead, it is presented as a comedy. I laughed too. This movie is, of course, an advertisement and confirmation in latent form for certain tenets which I will probably not go into (I apologize, I just don't have the time for the work.) but hopefully enough is to say that, as they agreed on, : 'all is fair in love and war.'",4,2,5,2 November 2007
Elf," What spectacle, what heart!
","Will Farrell stars as a human adopted by elves into Santa's workshop at the North Pole. When he finds out he is human after all, he heads back to New York City to be redeemed by the love of his biological father and perhaps civilization in general, or at least the half-hearted Christmas Caroling of New Yorkers; It takes little while for the suspension of disbelief to come into effect, but after it gets a hold of you, you're off for the ride. Hold onto your reins, because it's a good one.I watched this film with tears in my eyes. What spectacle, what heart! With a good story, and most importantly with actors like James Caan,Will Farrell, Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, and Zoey Descchanel's bittersweet charms to counterpoint the mix, it is easy to see why.Does this redeem America? For two hours and ...minutes I would have to say yes. I don't think you can make a comedy better than that.",10,0,1,12 February 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Boy, oh boy.
","I'm not sure I have anything original to add to all the other one star reviews. They kinda say it all together. Um, uh, well, uh, oh boy. The most interesting and saddest thing is, one supposes, is the film itself, and the popular 'official' reaction to it. These people have no decency, and no taste (which requires judgment.)Ten lines of text? Better to forget about it, but not entirely. What else can one say? What else should one say? Did a good part of the academy show itself in celebrating this, eh, film? Can you say 'Academy award.' Queasy yet?",1,5,10,19 March 2008
Mamma Mia!," Mama Mia!
","Why not make a film like this with young actors instead of old women who are not funny? Maryl Streep is miscast in this role. She is very difficult to look at, and would be a better cast as a which in Narnia, or something. Young, healthy, energetic women, that's the way to go in a musical!I have never wished anyone ill in my life. I hope they loose their shirt on this film. Try as they might to ruin the great ABBA songs, they fail mainly if you exit the theater in time! Good luck! Terrible film. Awful film.",1,10,20,22 July 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Not post-modern smoke and mirrors
","Charlie Kaufman has come up with what I think is his best film. He has a wicked shameless idea, and in Eternal Sunshine he sets his widgets on the board and puts them in motion. And what do they do? They hurt, they insult, they blame, and they cry. And at the end none of that changes. The pleasure in this film for me was minimal, yet holistic, which is to say Kaufman did his job. The idea behind the images is a thoughtful one and one, I believe, worth seeing played out on the big screen. What one hopes one takes from this film, in addition to the ride, is a thorough understanding where heart and mind fuse for an instant or maybe a few minutes while the film lingers in one's consciousness, is that most people walking around these days are sick, seriously sick organisms who not only want to function as normal people do, that is to say find love and happiness, but don't realize that they are sick. That's the danger to normal people, and to themselves. We can understand them, sympathize with them if you want to, but comprehend that it is only when they develop understanding regarding their problems, as the people in the film did, that they can begin to come into their own sunshine.This film is just so sad. But the message is twofold, for me anyway. The intended one by Kaufman, is that that's the way it is, and it's o.k. Another film should really start when this one ends, in which those two live their lives together, at least for a while. How would it be to look at that? Making do with sickness, co-dependency, childhood neglect, trauma , and finally finding someone who will still try to love you. Hm. Yeah. The second thing I get from it is that this is such the other side of the coin. Life is so Amazing, so beautiful, if you're healthy, of course, and can escape these travails. Unfortunately it's not a choice for everyone who finds themselves in this situation. But if your not like these people, as I am not, the best that I can do is stay away from them. They're kind of hard to spot right away, aren't they?! Especially when you're young.This movie is astounding. In a way. You have to keep closed the entire time and let it open you up in the end for you to appreciate it, and understand it. Not the way I'm use to looking at films. Sickness, Co-dependency, it's everywhere according to Kaufman, welcome to urban America! I'm watching this film and thinking the whole time, God, a bunch of sick people going through the motions of trying to find love and failing miserably. Great. And I get to watch it all...but in the end it makes sense. I was also thinking 'Post-modern smoke and mirrors,' but, no, what this film says is that' the way it is, these are the kind of people who are around, and for me anyway, BE CAREFUL, right? Why can't you open up to this film? So much bad energy. So sad. Better to think about it. It will hit you in the end, though.",9,0,2,17 January 2009
The Fountain," Exceedingly bad
","The only thing good about this movie is Hugh Jackman. There was no hook in the story from the very beginning, which makes one say the writing was awful. It was awful throughout; too intellectual, not enough emotion, no emotional core to the film, but apparently that's Aronovsky. Maybe he'll do better with Robocop, which might be more for him, after all. Sad to say after Requiem.Apparently not a good idea to make a large Sci-fi film for 35 million with stars. This film should have never been made. Bad effects, bad cinematography (a surprise actually), and terrible production design because everything looks phony including the colors in the frame. I understood the hubris part on the part of the main character at the resolution after trying to conquer death the entire film, but after being bored on the verge of pain for the entire film it is an intellectual insight that can hardly make the film worth it. It's like a long, boring, painful trek up a mountain that when you get to the top you discover that, in fact, look, the sun does set in the west. Amazingly bad pretentious painful movie, oh sorry, film.",1,1,5,27 August 2009
There Will Be Blood," Really suffers on second viewing.
","Anderson is the best American director working with big budgets, period. Which screenwriter who has penned a masterpiece on paper (and not wanting to do the dirty work themselves) would not want Paul making their film? I have the highest regard for him. The highest. In the league with Mikhalkov and Almodovar. I think I know what's wrong with this film. To me the catchism 'character study' has always been a cop out for not making a film which works on what Robert Mckee terms the 'extra personal' level of conflict. That, or has not classically arced the character which feels completely wrong for this film. It is fantastic to begin to show this devastating greed of the American flavor in such detail, but to what ends? To the spiritual and moral devastation of one man, but so what, meaning that what Anderson has here is the primordial greed that is still destroying this country, and with what he has written it is not enough to make an aesthetically definitive statement on how it effects everyone of us.Many people are confused by its message, as they were with the central message of Magnolia...which was unavoidable actually..(who's fault is it that people aren't versed in the Bible....The plague will come if we don't wise up.) If the film were to have shown, for example, how this redoubtable myopia affected at least the townspeople already in the film, or to write more emboldened (WARNING: The budget just went up considerably) if Mr. Plainview becomes Senator Plainview and naturally continues his cultivated habits of the perfect businessman really in the political arena, then we would start to care, because then it would be plain to comprehend and appreciate what a felt monster this character truly has become, and the consequences of the propagation of this cherished American ethos (when unchecked by other forces like religion, or love of family) when applied unilaterally ....work hard, be number one, etc. This film does not go far enough.",3,9,15,24 March 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Excellent historical fiction
","I do believe it was the editor's fault that this film was not even nominated for an Academy award. Should have won in my opinion instead of The Departed, but Scorcese was due.How many times can he cut to James McAvoy's face for reaction before the film becomes as heavy-handed as a leaden spoon? Excellent film really which moves a bit too fast for me.Was there enough coverage in this film? Hard to say without seeing all the footage. Really impressive that it was apparently made for eight million considering its scope and quality. Leave it to the English to keep the costs down.",10,0,1,26 September 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Iv'e never seen such honesty on the screen, have you?
","This is the most enjoyable Woody Allen film that I've seen. Wonderful, open, honest, film about people searching for meaning through relationships with others. Would have been very nice if the people involved had in fact forged out a more meaningful life for themselves, but at least they got a taste of something real, and I suppose that is more than many. Those two girls going back home at the end of the film is actually interesting, because we know when they come back nothing will ever come close in feelings to what they had. So the ending actually works. The world needs more fearless and honest screenwriters and filmmakers! What a treat this film is. What a treat.",10,4,10,14 March 2009
Pineapple Express," The best comedy ever made.
","Pretty cool, ay!? Not much to say, just got back from the film, at least...a couple of girls sitting next o me laughed, really dead house. One has to see this movie on Friday night, for sure. People just sat there in front of me. 2 of them. I hardly noticed they were there, because they never made a sound.This was a great film because it lets you feel. You can relax and open up and enjoy life. People are so frozen these days they just sit there in the theater. I don't even smoke out. The concession you have to make in order to partake in this disbelief are the murders, which are too real at times, it seems. Couldn't they have made the gunshots quieter? This is the best comedy ever made. I laughed my head off. Why did the screenwriters decide to sell drugs to fourteen year olds? Smoked so much they didn't think about it. Movie builds a really good case against legalizing drugs, actually, and surprising that it carried some serious heart.",1,3,13,30 August 2008
