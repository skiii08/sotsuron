The Ring," Can We Say..SUCKS *spoilers..sort of*
",Okay...can we say horrible...its almost like a rip off of fear dot com....its the same Flavor of Kool Aid Just a different color. It has a few more suspenseful parts but its not very explanitory...its cut sort of short...and it does way more than just leave u hanging...One of the 3 movies I tossed my cup at the screen.Everyone was saying 'O that movie rocks...' after I saw it the first time. SO I watched it again. It didnt get any better. I think its yet another sad attempt at a horror.Im not going to say it isnt worth watching..If your easily scared...and your gullible..then watch it. If you like to nit pick the facts out of the movie and explain how horrible it is...then watch it..laugh...and rent some classic horror that floats your boat.I gave this movie a rockin 1,1,0,2,27 October 2002
