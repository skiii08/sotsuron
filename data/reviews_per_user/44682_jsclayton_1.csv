The Hangover," Best Comedy Ever
","You know I thought it would be hard to top the comic lineup of films that we had in 08'. Tropic Thunder, Pineapple Express, Step Brothers, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and Role Models. Last year was a good comedy year. Until 12:01 A. M. June 5th, 2009.The Hangover has got to be the funniest film I have ever seen. The characters have great development and fall wonderfully into their situation. If you haven't seen the preview here's a synopsis: Guy's go to Vegas for bachelor party, they get messed up, spend the rest of movie looking for the groom they lost the night before. Bradley Cooper was the perfect choice for the leader of the bozos about in Las Vegas. Ed Helms is perfect as the doctor with the horrible girlfriend (Also played very convincingly by Rachel Harris) and the uptight but loose at the same time attitude. ALAN is the off the wall comic relief in this equation and has some of the most memorable lines in the film. The soundtrack is also great and goes well with this film.This is truly the funniest movie in a long time that I have seen.Go Watch AS Soon AS Possible",10,4,9,9 June 2009
