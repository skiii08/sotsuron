Scarface," The Greatest Movie of the 80s?
","What can I say?This movie is simply fantastic! Al Pacino is masterful and extremely believeable as Tony Montana. This movie never drags, always excites.It is 3 hours long, but of all the 3 hour long movies I have ever seen, this seems like the shortest. It never seems like 3 hours, and to achieve that, for me, is the sign of a great movie.One of the best without doubt!",Null,0,0,13 November 1999
