The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," amazing and not far from Perfect
",I have seen this movie twice. I liked it MUCH better the first time because I watched all the Twilight movies before this one and it affected me so much... The second time I saw it was great but not as powerful. It was not just because I have already seen it i saw it at a private screening last night Kristen and Robert's acting was outstanding but Taylor Lautner was a little Disappointing at the birth scene and i'm team Jacob by the way First time viewing: 10/10 Second time viewing: 9/10 You MUST watch the rest as well. I guarantee it will be such a satisfying experience. Twilight FORTHE Oscars,10,17,78,14 November 2011
