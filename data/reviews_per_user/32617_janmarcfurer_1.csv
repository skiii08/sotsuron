Blade Runner 2049," Watch in cinema!.. But don't think there is anything to think about.
","I watched this movie with about 10 friends (different age, different sex, very different taste of movies) and we all more or less had the same impression of the film:Visuals: Stunning! Definitely one of the most beautiful movies ever! (10/10) Music/Sound: Amazing, immersive, powerful etc. ! (10/10) Story: The opinions go from 'not bad, but predictable' to just 'Boring' (there are definitely some big issues with the script) (6/10) Acting: Gosling does a great job, Ford is just Ford...(aka 'boring') (7/10) Philosophy: Stupid or non-existent. (2/10) Why should we care about replicants but hate humans? The distinction between men and replicants is not thought through at all... The movie tries to be meditative (like the first one) but really isn't because there is barely anything to meditate about (also like the first one). Conclusion: It is almost a 'must watch' but don't expect it to be suspenseful (the only thing suspenseful is the music..). Please watch it in a cinema! (2D or 3D doesn't matter but image and sound does...)",8,1,6,9 October 2017
