Blade Runner 2049," Breathtaking!
","As a true fan of the original, this one takes the core heart of the original and expands on it, fully complimenting the original! I cannot recommend it enough and think the reviewers giving it bad low rating s are missing the point and not fully appreciating the subtle references and expansion of all the themes in the first film. Of course still has a high average rating of 8 but it should be 10 IMO. All I can say is don't go and see it for yourself before pre judging. It's well worth it, even if it's just for the awesome visuals!!!!",10,4,9,1 April 2018
