Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I was soooooooooo disappointed!! If you have not seen the movie you may not want to read on!
","I loved Kill Bill VOL I.  In fact, I had watched it three times in the three days prior to rushing out to see this one.  Unfortunately, what I walked out with was utter disappointment!  Not only does this movie not enjoy the pace of the first, but it is downright boring!!  As I sat in the theater at the end of the film, I found myself trying way to hard to like it.   About 20 seconds or so later, I had to admit that I hated it.  It wasn't until I got home, however that I hit on the core reason I didn't like it.  I could have gotten past the fact that the storyline felt thrown together in a feeble attempt to bring it all together at the end.  I even could have gotten past Darryl Hannah's horrible overacting in both films.  In the end what I found unforgivable was that QT casts David Carradine, Mr. Kung Fu himself, and then doesn't let his character, Bill, survive for more than a couple of minutes.  I was looking forward to seeing a grand finale' of a fight scene with more of the same amazing wire work that was used in the first film. It was the most anticlimactic ending that could have possibly been conceived. How do you cast David Carradine and then not even have him in a decent fight scene.  The real pity of this film is that it ends up ruining the first one too.  Part of the appeal of VOL I is the cliffhanger ending.  But with no payoff in VOL II, who cares??",Null,3,7,18 April 2004
