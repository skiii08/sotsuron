Skyfall," a real thriller with a good mix of older 007 and new
","I enjoyed this DVD from the library very much. Daniel Craig plays a believable James Bond. There are some of the older 007 action scenes and similar gimicks with updates thanks to the younger Quartermaster. Eve plays well with grit and feminism including a surprise revelation at the end. It's touching as well with the final scenes in the mansion and the old Caretaker. Adele's award for best song is well deserved. The title sequence is awesome with old and new graphics in a very mesmerizing vein. Opening chase with top of train running, car chase and sniper like shooting is memorable including the Boss's directive to take the d... shot! I plan to re-view other 007 books and movies. Daniel Craig looks great in his workout poses.",9,2,8,8 April 2013
Taken," good story of family, change and action in Paris
","I watched Taken on a library DVD after watching Taken2 earlier. Taken sets more of the scene of the retired CIA agent trying to stay near his 17-yr old daughter while being the ex-husband and much poorer than the step-father. He has his daughter's best interests at heart. As other reviewers have noted, watch the story unfold and don't think about the props and action scenes. Iaam is great and always finds the weapons, technology, and people just in time. The location and action scenes are lovely as well as dark. His buddies are helpful and funny. The rescue scenes are physically brutal as well as the shooting particularly in the French agent's house.",7,1,1,3 April 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Well done script and action of sensitive subject
","This movie made me think throughout it of the time period and what little I knew of the events outside of the U.S. There are many roles citizens play that only are known from being there or seeing an excellent movie. Tears, patriotism and completing the tasks go together. The R rating is valid but one should expect it from the subject matter. It presented well in the movie theater with great sound as it's Oscar win indicates. Jessica deserves her Oscar nomination. The conclusion is spellbinding and sensitive with mission accomplished and thought to a humanitarian element which must be weighed with the early scenes of terrorism.",8,0,3,14 March 2013
Taken 2," fast action, serious family issues yet humor at times
","I enjoyed this DVD from my local library. I like Liam Neesen. Since I had not seen the original Taken movie my only knowledge of the movie was in the brief trailers around the Academy Awards time. The scenes over the roof tops reminded me of some of my son's video games a few years ago. The triangulation of location by cell phone signal, counting turns, smoke, and wind direction is somewhat a 'leap of faith'. The speed of the scenes led me to accept the locating of the family members rather than thinking too hard. There is a good underlying story of family cohesiveness or sometimes lack thereof. The funniest line was his asking Kim if 'she could shoot'.I also wondered as another reviewer how she could on demand drive a stick shift so well with speed. Use of GPS was funny too in the fast action scenes.",7,0,1,25 March 2013
Flight," awesome story with multiple depths of action and pathos
","This is an awesome movie with deep stories of family, professionalism, friends, heroism, and addictions. The 'R' rating is very accurate. I know some partial viewers who may not have previewed it well enough and were disappointed and stopped the video. The story is much deeper in the relating of the addiction traumas than the plane crash heroism and sadness. Expect flashbacks to the excellent flying maneuvers and passenger and crew reactions. More to the movie than the early flight scenes and aftermath. It reminds me somewhat of 'Pulp Fiction' on a more believable sense for many folks. I saw this video from a library DVD. I was pleased with John Goodman's acting, comedy, and high speed delivery.Denzel is great in all facets of the complex character and a thought provoking conclusion.",8,0,1,30 March 2013
