The Devil's Advocate," Great overall movie, except in the horror department.
","A prime example of how a bigger budget doesn't necessarily means a scarier horrorfilm. As a matter of fact, it's very hard to be scared of the devil when he's played by Al Pacino. Although he's one of the greatest actors of all time, i just never stopped seeing him as Al Pacino, when i should have seen him as the devil. That's what you get when you cast a megastar in this kind of part. He smirks, smiles, an surely talks a lot. There are wisecracks, dialogues filled with philosophy and intelligence. There's nudity and beauty, and some degree of hard violence. But if this is THE devil, Satan himself, then he sure doesn't scare me.The scenes where the girlfriend, played by Charlize Theron, gradually goes out of her mind are the most effective in the movie, including the scene where she ends her own psychological suffering. But for the rest, it's a great movie, with fantastic acting performances (even by Keanu Reeves), great dialogue, good special effects, a great climax, and a damn good score. Too bad it's supposed to be a horrorfilm, because where it fails is the most important part, it's just not scary.",7,0,0,26 July 2000
The Blair Witch Project," Pure terror, for only 50.000 dollars in production costs.
","First of all, to all the people saying nothing much happened in 'Blair Witch project', this is NOT 'Friday the 13th part 10'. So if you wanted to see this movie thinking a hockeymask-wearing maniac jumps from the bushes, lopping heads off with an axe, you've been heavily misinformed. You can't be cheated, nothing of the sort was ever stated in the ads. This is a movie about REAL terror, not about 7 foot mutes who get up after stabbing them 20 times with a pitch fork. Those who say they've never been remotely scared or at least feeling uneasy when hearing strange sounds in the woods at night, read no further. You don't really exist. I dare you to really watch this movie, try to experience it, and then go out in the woods at night and say you're totally cool when you hear children crying out in the dark, or twigs snapping all around you as if you're surrounded by a group of unknown animals or even humans.I must honestly say i knew about the hype when i saw this movie, and still wasn't disappointed, because once again, i KNEW there was going to be no Jason hiding in any barn waiting for an unsuspecting victim to foolishly come strolling in just to get spliced into ribbons of human flesh. I expected frustration, anger, fear, hysteria and downright TERROR. You know, the emotions real people have when in a situation like this. That's why the acting was perfect. These were real flesh and blood people who first got uneasy, then frustrated to getting more scared with each abnormal sound or found object. Real people yell at each other when frustrated and get hysterical when at the end of their emotional ropes. The photography and editing was perfect too. To people saying it was amateuristic: HELLO,WAKE UP! The whole idea of the movie is based on the premise of amateur filmmakers making the footage we, as an audience, see when they go into the woods. If these amateur filmmakers made professionally shot footage, then it would have been an amateuristic movie. The whole thing is brilliant. Right upto and including the nerve-wrecking ending. If you only have about 50.000 dollars to spend and want to make to make the best movie you can make with that kind of movie, this is how you make it.Remember: Godzilla cost over 100 million dollars. What a great movie that turned out to be, huh?",10,2,3,25 July 2000
The Exorcist," The devil made me do it.
","I can just imagine how this film was the scariest film ever seen when it first came out. Imagine, in 1973 a movie coming out about a 12 year old sweet little girl who is gradually becoming possessed by the devil, and starts spitting out the most vile and embarrassing profanities, that would even have the average movieaudience turning red now. A priest getting green vomit in the face. Physical decline. And thrown in a lot of psychological and emotional pain for some of the characters, played by an extremely well performing cast. Although a movie like this wouldn't shock as nearly as much today, it still hardly seems dated.Most of the 'possession' movie have been inspired by this classic, from 'Evil dead' to 'Fallen'.Sequels differ in quality, with the dreadful 'Exorcist 2-the heretic' and the almost worthy 'Exorcist III - Legion'.",10,0,1,29 July 2000
The Evil Dead," Brilliant milestone in horror history!
","Here's another movie that definitely has viewers give black or white opinions. You either love it or you hate it. Exceptions not counted, my guess is: if you're not a true horror fan, you'll absolutely despise this brilliant piece of film. It's understandable because if you're not to it, the constant terror, haunting sound effects, scary photography (from the forest creature's point of view), and bathtubs full of blood and other gore that occupy the screen for 75% of the duration will put you off if not sicken you beyond belief. But if you would manage to see beyond that, you'd see the incredible talent of Sam Raimi, the director. The vision, the way of shooting the movie, the choice of sound effects, are examples of a great new master at work. The special effects are low budget, yes, but once again to all the people who complained, THIS WAS A LOW BUDGET FILM! You can't buy a Mercedes with minimum wage. And however 'bad' the effects may have been, they were still effective and at times pretty scary. Just watch this movie alone in the dark late at night and you'll see.When i first saw this movie i was shocked at the gore displayed in this film, and although less so, still am today. With the exception of certain zombie films, especially the brilliant 'Brain dead', there has yet to be a horror movie making this attempt to gross you out. Another thing which made me give this milestone of horror a perfect 10 is that there's some dark humor, but just enough to not get in the way of the shocks it's trying hand out.",10,1,2,27 July 2000
Carrie," One of the best Stephen King adaptations.
","This movie is an adaptation of the first book Stephen King ever wrote, and i think it couldn't have been better.First of all, it's directed by Brian DePalma, who made some dreadfully boring thrillers (Obsession), but also some very suspenseful thrillers (Dressed to kill, Body double). This falls into the second category. It also has some great actors at the start of their careers. After this movie, Sissi Spacek, Piper Laurie, John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving became highly respected actor/actresses.What makes this movie work so well is the involvement with the characters. Carrie, the main characters is a tragic and (aside from the supernatural powers) very realistic character. Who hasn't know a very insecure, shy teenage girl that the more popular people used to pick on. Only this time payback is a bitch. And although the way Carrie executes revenge on all those who have taunted her is very violent, you can't help but sympathize with her after all she's been through. Here was a girl who after a very unhappy childhood was given a glimmer of hope by being chosen as the prom queen, only to find out it was a setup for the most disturbing, embarrassing humiliation possible. Sissi Spacek is especially great at this point, when she's lost all her marbles. Piper Laurie is fantastic as the domineering, religious fanatic mother, and the likes of John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving are pure evil personified as heartless classmates of Carrie who are relentless in their badgering of her.Weakhearted people should brace themselves for the final shot.",9,1,2,25 July 2000
The Sixth Sense," Great, but not as great as the hype says.
","So here it is. THE psychological/supernatural thriller of the new millennium, rewarded with 6 Academy award nominations. I expected a lot here, and got what i expected. A great, and sometimes chilling movie. I have to admit there were times i grew a bit restless while watching. After all, the boy was seeing things that other people couldn't see. Even we as an audience couldn't see. And it's hard to sympathize with this kid if we don't understand what scares him. But we got to see it about 30 minutes into the movie. The images presented to us were sometimes scary, as the deceased people the boy claims to see are in the state they were when they died. E.g. A boy who played with his father's gun, misses the back of his head. In the end comes the surprise you wouldn't have guessed if you tried. Which just proves how involving the movie is because the obvious clues to the surprise are there in plain view throughout the movie. To the people who haven't seen the movie yet, I dare you to guess the surprise even now i've said these things.Sixth sense is a great, if somewhat overhyped movie. It's great, yes, but a classic? Will you remember it 20 or 30 years from now as most people remembered Psycho? I doubt it.",8,0,0,25 July 2000
Evil Dead II," Comical remake of the best horror movie of the 80s.
","When you have to describe this film in one sentence it's like this: Evil Dead part 1 where 50% of the gore is replaces by hilarious slapstick and one-liners.Yes, it's more of a black comedy with some nasty gore than all out splatter like the first movie. You can't take a movie seriously in which a sawed off hand gives it's former owner the bird. It's almost as if the writers of 'the Naked gun' dropped by for a visit. Almost a replica of the original, the story follows the same road as in the first. Ash drives to a cabin in the woods with a new girlfriend, accidentally brings the demons back to this world and hell breaks loose again, only to make the movie become one big joke. First of all, it's totally incomprehensible why Ash would even THINK about setting foot in a cabin again, let alone willingly speak out the lines that would bring out some evil force. Did he suffer from amnesia after what happened to him the first time? It's almost as if Sam Raimi, the director said: 'ignore the first movie, and start with this, then go see Army of darkness'.If his intention was to make a comic book like horrormovie, he succeeded. The brilliant photography is almost another spirit as it races through the woods, tilts and spins. Bruce Campbell is fantastic as an anti-hero, especially when spitting out one-liners. However, never is this movie scary or shocking as the first movie, and that's always what i go for when watching a horror movie. As a spoof it's hilarious, as horror it's only average. However it's still an extremely entertaining and brilliantly shot film, so personally i'll give it a 9 out of 10.",9,1,1,27 July 2000
