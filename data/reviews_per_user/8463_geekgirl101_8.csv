Iron Man 3," What was the point in this movie?
","After seeing Marvel rewrite its own version of its own comic strips into movies and doing a far much better job at it I was looking forward to this one, even though Iron Man 2 was a bit meh and confusing. After all it's Marvel, and the comics are written by Marvel, what could go wrong?...Short answer: Everything in this movie.So Stark gives away his home location on live TV telling all the bad guys where he lives and to come and get him. And that's precisely what they do. After turning his luxury home into powder his costume breaks down and so he now spends a good chunk of the movie trying to fix it with the aid of some kid fan.Only we learn right at the end of the movie that it's not his only costume. He has not one, not two, but hundreds of them! Which leaves the question, why focus all his attention on fixing the one costume to fight the bad guys when he has hundreds at his disposal?The answer is pretty apparent when the Iron Man army is easily torn apart like paper dolls. No wonder Stark was focusing all his attention on his original suit. These weren't Iron Man suits, these were Plastic Man suits.And then what does he decide to do at the very end? He blows them all up! He has an operation done to remove the shrapnel from his chest, a contradiction to the Marvel comics where he was unable to have the shrapnel removed without it killing him, which is why he had the device in his chest to save his life in the first place!His decision to give up being Iron Man so that he and his wife can live a normal life is almost immediately set in full reverse when he goes back to the rubble of his home to pick up bits for building a new costume and states at the end 'you can take away my suits, you can take away my home, but there's one thing you can never take away from me - I am Iron Man.'Most confusing and pointless ending ever. Please don't make any more Marvel... please.",4,1,3,16 October 2013
Star Trek," Worst Star Trek movie ever
","I was very disappointed with this movie in so many ways. Decades of Star Trek lore have been completely annihilated in this movie.We meet the crew as they are at the academy, and straight away it's like one cheesy catch phrase after another. I just could not associate any of the characters with their future counterparts. Their personalities didn't really reflect each other. They looked like giddy teenage pals going to a Star Trek convention.The whole storyline just made no sense at all, and with so many plot holes, technobabble, unrealistic sequences, and characters that I couldn't relate to, it just wasn't a good movie to watch.On top of all that the only character I was able to relate to was Spock, only to me it wasn't Spock it was Syler with pointy eyebrows and ears and throughout the film I expected him to lift someone in the air and slice their head off. Thanks Heroes...",2,2,2,11 April 2013
Pacific Rim," Intense earache after watching
","Well, storywise there's plenty of reviews about this, so my beef is going to be about the noise levels. This movie seems to struggle with being too darned quiet when you want to hear what people are saying and too darned noisy when it gets to intense moments. I could hear it from 2 rooms away as if I was in the same room. My ears were ringing from the bass. The floor was vibrating, even the radiators were vibrating and buzzing, but as soon as the intense part was over it was too quiet to hear anything again. I was having to constantly adjust the volume control.You really don't have to deafen your viewers to pump up the intensity levels you know.",7,1,3,25 December 2013
Cast Away," An obvious advert for Fed-Ex
","Just because it has Tom Hanks in it does not mean I'm going to give it 10/10.For no reason at all the door of a delivery plane rips off and Tom ends up stranded on a remote island for years after the plane crashes into the ocean, using plane debris and washed up packages in order to survive.Of the washed up packages there is one that he reserves, and when we come to the end of the movie as he gets back to America he delivers this one package, hinting that no matter what Fed-Ex will deliver your parcel even if the delivery guy was stranded on a remote island for years.I really wasn't into this movie at all, it just wasn't appealing to me. Watching a guy living in a small cave talking to a volley ball and no background music just wasn't my idea of a movie.",5,0,1,20 October 2012
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 20 years later ...
","... and this film is still pretty damned awesome.Years after fighting for her own survival against the T-101 Sarah Conner has been locked away in an institute for mentally unstable criminals where she frantically worries about the safety of her son John who is living in foster care. Her concerns are just as not one but two cyborgs from the future have come in search of John.Once more we meet Arnold Schwarzeneggar playing as the T-101 who has been reprogrammed in the future by John to save his own life, and we meet a new advanced cyborg the T-1000 played by Robert Patrick which can mimic various shapes and people and can mold itself back into shape almost instantly when damaged.There is much excitement, high-speed chasing, and lots of wreckage and explosions throughout this movie as the T-101 attempts to save the lives of both John and Sarah and defeat the virtually unstoppable T-1000. This is an epic action movie that will have you watching on the edge of your seats.Enjoy!",9,0,0,11 April 2013
Thor," Awesome
","I don't know if this is the first time I've given a movie 10/10, but this does deserve every point. It's got a decent plot, the graphics are pretty damned awesome, and you can tell a lot of thought and money went into making this. It wasn't even cheesy, which a lot of movie conversions tend to suffer with. Marvel did a really good job at converting this comic book tale into a movie.I'm not going to complain about the use of mixed races in the movie, the actors all did a very good job at playing their roles and they really fitted in very well. And the ending was just perfect. I've seen too many 'and they all lived happily ever after' type endings, so the ending to this was just right.",10,1,4,19 December 2012
Sausage Party," If I could give it less than 1 star I would.
","For the first few minutes I found the sexual referencing and swearing in song pretty hilarious, but as the movie went on it was just going too far. The swearing was far too excessive, there was a lot of drug use (which says something about the guy who wrote this movie), and there was also a fair amount of offensive stereotyping too. It got beyond amusing and was just plain offensive with half the script being nothing but profanities. When I eventually got to watching it through I was not at all entertained but was angry with myself for letting myself watch it through. It went from being plain offensive to absolutely vulgar just for the sake of pushing how far they could go with this movie. Very distasteful and pure garbage. There were very few moments where I found the movie funny but this paled to the amount of frustration and disgust I felt in watching the majority of it. You don't have to be sickening to be an adult movie.",1,3,6,30 September 2018
Warcraft," Good but...
","Despite having played World of Warcraft since vanilla days I'm not one of those fanboys who is going to give this a perfect 10/10 full of praises, because it's not a perfect 10/10.Without giving away the plot if I can the movie is already condensed to roughly 2 hours and it is very noticeable. It feels as if the 'filler' scenes have been cut out in order to create 1 movie instead of splitting it into 2 movies. Unless you are a long-time World of Warcraft player you will be lost into where the story is taking place as it jumps from one place and extremity to another with no buildup or any sense of direction. You're given names of places part-way through but you'll still end up pretty lost wondering where the heck things are currently taking place. You end up discovering things as they are in full immersion and asking yourself many times 'hey did I miss something, when did that suddenly come into play?'Despite that the movie has many holes in the storyline that if you blink you feel you might've missed what feels like 15 mins of plot buildup, the biggest fear of all I had was the use of CGI and the announcement that the graphics were going to look slightly cartoony in order to fit in with the game. Thankfully the orcs don't look like badly rendered Hulks (except for baby Thrall who looks like mini Shrek), but the dwarf race looks like they were plucked from Disney Pixar's Brave.There's no introduction to the other races and they don't have much to do in the story as it's virtually based on humans vs orcs. The introduction to the movie only tells you that there is a war between orcs and humans and that the orc world was destroyed, but it doesn't tell you why their world was destroyed other than that the Fel had something to do with it. There's no explanation of who Gul'dan is and why he influences the orcs so much when they already have a warchief, and who the blue race at the start of the movie is and why the orcs have them in cages. Back in Stormwind during a heated discussion at the round table we see what I assume are 3 high elfs of the Kirin Tor who had only 7 words in the entirety of the movie and then we never see them again, but for anyone else who's never played World of Warcraft nobody would know who they were or why they were even in the movie. Even I don't know why they are there as they contribute nothing to the movie.Graphics wise the movie is beautiful and full of tremendous detail on the cities and orc outposts, except perhaps the street view of the city exit to Stormwind being once again something plucked out from Shrek the movie. The music is also good and has you in places thinking you're watching the game until you realize the graphics are a bit too good for the game.The acting is pretty good, but with holes throughout the story it makes it look bad in places.Overall not a bad attempt, if there's a director's cut to be released then it must be enough film to double the length of the movie and make sense of why events took place instead of pasting all the action scenes next to each other and calling it a movie and would've appealed to not only the existing World of Warcraft players but to all viewers.",8,0,0,27 September 2016
