Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A note on violence
","In all the reviews I've read here, none seems to mention one basic thing: the explicit cartoon-style violence of the film. I know that's the whole point of the film, I know it's a parallel world, and I know it's supposed to be comic-like, but the constant slow-mo beheadings and blood splattering are nauseating. I've clearly seen too few of these kinds of movies and am equally clearly old-fashioned. But to read reviews saying 'it's boring' or 'the action is fun' – have we become so completely jaded that we think killing sprees are a bit of fun (yes, I know it's like a cartoon, yes, I know Lincoln's slaying evil in the film - I'm talking about the principle of the thing)? Are we so blasé that we need even more gore to be stimulated into feeling anything?",2,2,6,14 September 2012
A Beautiful Mind," Overacted
","I'm as big a Russell Crowe fan as they come, but this time he has taken the facial tics too far. All one sees on screen is (O-V-E-R)A-C-T-I-N-G rather than a believably portrayed character. One can never get past the fact that it's Russell-Crowe-as-John-Nash rather than just John Nash. This does not matter so much in other (types of) movies, but here it disturbs the whole process of spectator involvement, never allowing you to relax and settle back in your seat in order to watch the drama unfold.The film does manage to take the spectator into the world of schizophrenia and make it seem 'real', and the moment of realisation (when Nash is suddenly able to separate reality from delusion) is cleverly done. As a whole, however, the film is belaboured and conventional, crying out for Academy attention with its uplifting love-conquers-all story featuring a mentally disturbed genius as the protagonist. (This practically sounds like the Oscar instruction manual on How To Get Nominated.) The attention was duly given. Never mind that the actual facts of the real John Nash's life were somewhat white-washed in the movie for mass appeal.Jennifer Connelly is a graceful presence throughout the film, but her character is too good to be true. Only one or two scenes show her as a human being with messy emotions and desperation rather than as that June Allyson cypher, the long-suffering 50s wife. The standout is Paul Bettany as Nash's room-mate - charming, believable and natural, as effortless in his acting as Crowe is obvious.",5,0,1,22 February 2002
