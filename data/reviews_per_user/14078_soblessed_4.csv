The Blair Witch Project," No Movie In My Lifetime Has Made Me Feel More Ripped-Off!
","They should have been SUED big-time for the lying hype for this piece of garbage! Scary,not in the least. Offensive,extremely so,unless you you get off on a SHRILL,unattractive female saying the 'F' word every few seconds.This was a group of TOTAL MORONS! Most 12 yr.olds would have shown shown more intelligence than these idiots! Their stupidity is absolutely jaw-dropping,and infuriating. So unbelievable as to make this completely appear as the worst piece of backyard video(OK,so it's in some woods)anyone has ever attempted to make. I believe 12 yr. olds would have done a better job all the way around,come to think of it. I HATE,HATE,HATE this movie and how offensive and totally unbelievable it is.I hope no one who has not seen it will ever waste their time with this. If you do, you have been forewarned!",1,3,6,18 August 2005
Lost in Translation," What A Bunch of Undeserved Hype!
","I watched this at 3 in the afternoon and could barely manage to keep awake. Unbelievably slooooow, and BORING! I did not care for this at all. I didn't care about the characters, and I thought they both seemed incredibly bored with this movie themselves! I can't believe all the hype about this movie. You must have to be 'stoned' to get into this! Spoiler Ahead: What is with the disgusting scene with the topless dancer? Totally uncalled for and just a dirty, cheap shot. I gave this garbage a '1' and it didn't even deserve that! You can be sure that I'm telling all my movie-going friends who appreciate 'good, decent' films to avoid this. I  wish I hadn't bothered to sit through the whole thing. It was TORTURE!",1,3,9,22 August 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Don't Know Whether To Laugh Throughout Or Be Offended!
","I cannot fathom why so many love this movie! I find it an insult to serious martial artists. I don't know that I have ever seen ANYTHING so outrageously unrealistic in my life. I felt like I was watching Peter Pan trying to be a serious movie! Completely Ridiculous would describe it for me. Yes,there is some nice scenery and that's about it for me. I think Jackie Chan's movies are more honest. At least they do not take this nonsense seriously. I will stick to my Bruce Lee DVDs and forget these modern martial arts films that make a mockery of the art. maybe that's the way they like them in Asia,but they can keep them over seas then as far as I'm concerned! Makes me wonder what drugs so many of the movie-going public is on. 2 stars for the scenery!",Null,1,8,30 July 2005
The Last Samurai," This Movie Was AWESOME!
","Despite the fact that I am not a Tom Cruise fan,(never liked him in anything except Far And Away) I thoroughly enjoyed this movie which I just watched on DVD last night. I still don't think he has any great acting ability and feel that this movie is just sooo good that MANY actors could have carried his part. As an example- Warning Spoilers ahead: When the Japanese widow of the warrior he killed is dressing him in the samuri armor she shows great feeling for him in her movements and especially her eyes, while Tom Cruise's character seems totally unaffected, like a statue, and his eyes show no emotion what-so-ever. This, despite the fact that the movie has been leading you on with shots of their growing feelings to one another, but even in those, she is the one who gets the point across, much more so than anything Cruise gets across. I have always found Tom Cruise attractive, but his acting just doesn't impress me at all. He just doesn't have 'something' for me. I don't know if it is the movies he has been in or exactly what it is. Yet this movie is excellent and his ability as an actor, I am still not convinced of. I actually think I would have been even more moved by another actor playing his character,but cannot think of who I would have chosen at this minute. I agree that he did not deserve an oscar for this part. This wonderful part carried itself, in this film. That said, I must say, I found the film beautiful to look at and very emotionally moving on several different levels. It was a wonderful movie-watching experience for me. I give it an 8 out of 10.",Null,1,2,16 August 2004
