The Perks of Being a Wallflower," This is real life on camera
","Beautifully written, expertly acted, directed well, and perfectly designed, this movie succeeds on all levels. And not just as a high school movie, but as one about human beings. The clich√©d issues and scenarios that inevitably come with a high school film are handled with such humanity and honesty that they become authentic. There are hilarious moments and heartbreaking ones and your emotions go on a roller coaster ride that is synonymous with high school itself. Instead of the usual cringe-worthy sentimentality, you feel something for the 3 dimensional characters simply because it is all so real. During one of the best scenes, the main character Charlie says 'I feel infinite.' This movie is infinite because it can appeal to more than just high school students. The core themes and conflicts are all humane that just happen to be set in a high school.",10,0,1,22 December 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," How to do a novel adaptation right
","One of only a handful of films that successfully adapt a novel to the screen. The movie manages to perfectly capture the thrilling atmosphere of the novel, and for that reason alone, is a strong film in its own right.Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter is chilling right from his first shot. And despite having less than 30 minutes of screen time, his influence is felt throughout the entire film.Jodie Foster is right at the same level. Not until the end did I notice her seamless transition from a submissive to dominant character. Her performance shone through and carried the film.The direction is spot on; tight and tense. There is a remarkable buildup of suspense, particularly at one point towards the end that made my heart race.Perhaps the most amazing accomplishment is that every technical aspect managed to not stick out in an overt way. Instead, they all blended perfectly to create the right mood, which is what film is all about. I cannot recommend this film enough. You get well-crafted writing, outstanding performances, thrilling direction, and an all-together feeling of terror.",10,5,11,9 December 2012
