Ford v Ferrari," Meh
",It's just another dramatic portrayal of an already interesting story. The movie is entertaining but you can get more out of reading Wikipedia. I sound cynical but there is more to film than this.,6,1,2,5 March 2020
First Man," One Small Step (Back) For Chazelle
","I feel like this film is supposed to be trying to say something but I just can't tell what that is or if it is even trying at all. It is a different perspective of the 'man' from the legendary 'one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind'. It takes a look at the dark side of the story of Neil Armstrong and tells the stories of his misfortunes. It does this, I think, poorly. If the movie's only goal was to tell the story of the First Man then, sure, it did a fine job but I find it hard to believe that this was supposed to simply be a dramatized documentary. There are frequent dramatic moments throughout the film that occurred in real life but left me feeling nothing. I can't remember a single moment when I felt like I was feeling any emotion other than mild frustration. Chazelle just isn't in his element. I don't think it was the musical aspect of his previous two films that brought out the quality in them. They had much better acting, more daring shots and less bad special effects. Ryan Gosling isn't close to as good as he was in La La Land. It's like he was told to act as melancholic and mysterious as possible while just quoting Armstrong. There isn't anything about his character, or any character for that matter, that I admired. I get the appeal of making a movie about one of the most important men in history and I get the appeal in trying to make something original but it seems that Chazelle's charm was lost in his ambition.",5,0,1,7 February 2019
Black Swan," Unnecessarily Unpleasant
","This has all the pieces of a special film but I can't help but think that it seriously missed the mark. I think it's trying too hard is what it comes down to. I enjoy subjectivity and feeling uneasy while watching something but there are too many lazy plot points to ignore. There are so many unnecessary little occurrences that are in the film for no other reason than to cause uneasiness. They don't move the story along and they don't add a tense layer to the movie, they simply make me not want to watch. The story, itself, is interesting but the movie is just unnecessarily unpleasant for too long. Portman and Kunis do well with their roles but Portman's character is far too annoying at times. I understand all of these visions she has are products of mental illness that is derived from her unusual home-life and uncompromising commitment to her work but a lot of the film just doesn't work for me. I'm a very big proponent of showing things instead of always saying them but Black Swan takes pieces of information that might have been better off implied and brazenly puts them on screen, often in a manner that comes off as cheap. I admire the idea behind the film but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.",5,4,5,17 April 2019
Us," Nothing Special
","This is an average thriller. I can't find anything that makes it anything more. The characters, to me, are boring and I didn't care for any of them. I found myself laughing more at their stupidity than caring for their situation. I don't get why they couldn't be a bit more compelling. Right from the start, they constantly make stupid decision after stupid decision. Stupidity is the driving force behind the plot just like so many other basic thriller/horror movies in the past. I know that it's probably supposed to be an allegory for what our current real-world situation is but I just couldn't get myself to care for it. The twists were boring and didn't make the story that interesting. It feels, to me, like Peele was so concerned with trying to say something that he didn't bother to wonder if the movie was something worth giving a voice to. Get Out was, at least, different than what most people had seen before. This, though, is just more of the same.",5,1,1,3 April 2019
Knives Out," A Good Puzzle

The Irishman," Just Fine
","The actors ages were a little hard to get over for me but I still enjoyed the film. The narrative is interesting but, along with the whole movie, clearly catered to an older crowd. I don't really see anything that makes this film stick out over others in Scorsese's oeuvre. Pacino's performance as Jimmy Hoffa was the most notable aspect of the film.",6,0,4,27 January 2020

BlacKkKlansman," At least it had something to say
",This movie isn't anything special but at least it had something to offer other than just mindless entertainment like many of the films recently lauded by audiences. The message that the film presents is certainly polarizing but at least it is trying. The movie is somewhat entertaining and follows a story that doesn't seem too contrived. There are some decent acting performances save the typical overacting we get from characters who are supposed to be portrayed as racists. The main drawbacks of the film are the occasional lapses in logic that present themselves and the score. The score is terrible. I don't know if Spike was going for a Fargo type of thing or simply cliche dramatic music but it doesn't fit at all. Too much of my time was spent wondering why I was hearing so many unnecessary horns and strings instead of enjoying the show.,6,2,3,28 January 2019
The Passion of Joan of Arc," The Groundwork for Cinematic Drama
","This movie feels holy. Like if a Bible story was shot on camera, that how it feels watching this (I know it's not a Bible story). Every frame is packed with so much drama that it seems as if it were portraying something truly world-changing. Any frame could be a painting, they're all so well thought out. The Passion of Joan of Arc is carried by not only the surgical camerawork but by the passion of Marie Falconetti. She acts exactly how you'd expect a saint to act. I read somewhere that this was the first film that let people know that film could be art and, while I don't necessarily agree that this was the first, it's influence is clear even today in more serious films.",7,1,1,13 February 2019
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Good for a laugh or two
","This is a good movie if you care for comedy music, I guess. It has its funny moments but a lot of it is also dull. It's not trying to be a great film, it's just going for laughs. Not all of the jokes land but a good amount do. It's not the funniest movie I've ever seen but it's definitely not not funny.",5,0,0,2 May 2019
LÃ©on: The Professional," Too Many Bad Decisions
","Leon: The Professional is a somewhat engaging film filled with cliche, bad dialogue and overacting. I'm not sure if it's the first eccentric hitman movie and that's why it gets so much praise or if it was just different when it came out but this is just not a quality piece of work, in my opinion. I guess it's possible that some of the aforementioned cliches were derived from this movie and that would make it at least influential but I don't think many of them were. Gary Oldman's character was kind of compelling but it is clearly one of the many victims of overacting along with everyone in the police, the Italian mob and Mathilda's family. Add onto all of this the unshrouded sexualization of a 13 year old and you have what seems to be a highly praised film.",4,6,14,28 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," No Risks and No Reward
","This is a not a great work of cinema like most reviews on here would have you believe. It is mediocre, at best. There is nothing in the film that is done great except for the lip syncing. Everything else is average to bad. It's a typical overly dramatized biopic with the traditional random moments of serendipity sprinkled throughout to keep the story moving along. The acting is highly overrated. Malik is unconvincing in his role any time that he has to talk in a non-singing voice and the rest of the cast is as boring as the movie is itself. The only redeemable aspect of the film is (what I'm guessing is) archive audio of Freddie Mercury and the way they interpolated it.",5,3,6,28 January 2019

North by Northwest," The Blueprint
","In terms of influence, there are few that can be looked at as more important to film than North by Northwest. The way that the narratives plays out and reveals information to the viewer has been copied thousands of times since its release. The creative writing is the reason that the film has survived and is viewed the way it is now. The visuals are far superior to most of its contemporaries but it isn't enough to blow the viewer away like in Vertigo, for example, and the acting leaves something to be desired. However, the film is certainly one of the most influential works of art since the inception of cinema.",7,0,0,12 August 2019
American History X," It's All Ridiculous
","This movie is seriously flawed. Like everything about it is flawed. The slow motion is dreadful, the flashback scenes are almost always terrible and the message is ridiculous. A few specific awful pieces of the film include the fact that Danny has a single night to write this paper and does so with the eloquence of F. Scott Fitzgerald, the entire basketball game scene and how much blood Danny has in his body. But the worst part of the movie is definitely the idea that Derek needed to meet a nice black person in order for him to change his views. I get it has to do with him being sheltered and closed-minded but it doesn't make sense and gives the viewer a horrible idea of how racial differences can be solved. The film tries to push an agenda on the audience so hard and, at least in my eyes, falls flat on its face with its most important message. It's a major problem when a character's white supremacy rhetoric makes more sense than his reason for being reformed. There are countless cliches and more moments of bad acting. I don't think Norton did anything special and nobody else was good.",3,1,7,19 November 2019
Climax," It's Not That Deep
","The idea of Climax is an interesting one. It follows the same structure as a found-footage film if the found footage was shot professionally with a full crew. The events in the film follow a narrative but they are not leading towards anything. It's simply a progression of what might happen next in relation to preceding events. The film's problems come not from this unconventional style of storytelling but from the 'story' itself. Nothing in the film matters any more than anything else. The film keeps the viewers interested through shock-value more than anything else which, to me, comes off as cheap. There's not much to enjoy during the movie since it's mostly unpleasant. I think I understand that it's trying to forego the need for anything other than a climax but other than the atypical structure and some of the displeasing scenes, this film isn't memorable for much.",5,1,3,26 August 2019
The Pianist," Harrowing and Realistic
","I feel like I would've liked this more if I'd never seen a WWII movie or didn't understand before going into how horrible the period was for those involved. I did like it but I think I could've liked it more. It does a fantastic job of portraying how horrid the main character and other's descent into destitution was. It doesn't pull any punches. It treats the audience with respect. Brody's performance is great, mostly because of how much he is able to change throughout the film. I liked how (comparatively) lucky Brody's character kept getting throughout the movie because I thought it served as a commentary on how nearly-impossible it was for someone to survive in his shoes. I did feel as thought the film, as a whole, was missing something though I don't know how to say it without calling it boring, which it wasn't.",7,0,0,26 March 2020
The Favourite," It's just not weird enough
","There are two things you expect when going to see a Yorgos Lanthimos film. One: that it will be visually appealing and two: that it will be strange to the point of absurdity. This film meets the first expectation with flying colors. It is without a doubt his best looking project to date but it falls short in terms of the second. It is almost a normal movie and that is not necessarily a bad thing, it was just unexpected. The problem comes from the story itself. The events that the film is based on are fascinating and the film does them justice but there is only so far you can take this story without completely betraying the history. Now, this is only conjecture but it's possible the increased budget came with the goal of making a film that appealed to a wider audience (the director's other films certainly not being for everyone). Anyway, it is not a bad film but it certainly leaves me with something to be desired.",6,7,14,21 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A Modern, Revisionist, Western Fairy Tale
","As far as I'm (and I'm sure many others are) concerned, this is a two part movie. Both are quintessentially Tarantino. The first part of the film is filled with nostalgia and entertainment. It is an almost two hour love affair with the imperfect Hollywood of the 1960s and more specifically the part of Hollywood concerned with Westerns. It is no secret that Tarantino sees the Western genre as hugely influential to himself and it seems as though he is trying to pay homage to it and the culture around the genre's production for the majority of the film. There are multiple extended scenes devoted entirely to fictitious movie scenes that do little more than give DiCaprio's character more depth. This marks the third film in a row from Tarantino that is heavily concerned with the Western genre and his second consecutive, in my opinion, to have pacing problems.
I enjoyed the drastic turn that the narrative took very much. I thought it was clever and a quality display of a classic Tarantino ending. The film switches to its second part at the distinct moment where the narrative of the past and the narrative of Rick Dalton meet. From here one out, almost all historicity is thrown out in favor a sort of retribution for the fact the American psyche has been so corrupted by the events that actually took place. The idea that I think he was trying to get at was that this was his version of a fairy tale. The film didn't feel like a typical Tarantino movie until the end and I feel as though this idea has something to do with that as is evidenced by the 'Once upon a time' in the title.
I didn't dislike the first part of the movie but after watching the rest of the film it's hard for me not to have any problems with it. It doesn't feel like much of it matters in the grand scheme of the whole movie even though it takes up most of it. There were also a few characters who I felt were detrimental to the film; namely Bruce Lee and the little girl, Trudi. That's nothing against the actors (you're welcome, Trudi) that portrayed them. I just don't think their characters (among a couple others) were written well.",7,2,5,9 September 2019
1917," Made for the Oscars
",Basic characters and story structure with a little bit of expectation subverting. The 'one-shot' technique used comes off as gimmicky to me. I like how they actually made the soldiers look young like they should.,6,2,6,10 February 2020
Cold War," Too Much Left Unsaid
","I don't know if it was the language barrier but I had a difficult time following this movie. I couldn't tell where any of the character's motivations were coming from other than that they were lustfully attracted to each other. I understand that the political climate of the time dictated the lives of the people in the film but I couldn't always tell why it was making people do what they were doing. I'm usually one to appreciate subtlety in a film, especially when concerning changes in the background of it. But, with Cold War I feel that some nuanced explanation of events could have been useful. I was particularly frustrated at the very end of the movie when I had been thinking the whole time that the film was just too subtle for me to follow properly only for it to hit me with one of the most ham-fisted metaphors I can remember to close the movie. Maybe that was a play on how secretive the film had been and, if so, its charm was lost on me. I did enjoy the music and thought the two leads did a good job.",5,2,4,25 February 2019
Eyes Wide Shut," I Think I'm Disappointed
","This is a difficult film for me to wrap my head around. Stanley Kubrick is unequivocally my favorite director of all time. My two favorite movies (Dr. Strangelove and 2001) are both directed by him and I love most of his films. He is objectively a master of cinema. Having that opinion going into a film can sometimes be problematic. I have to resist the urge of over-analyzing things and treat it like a regular movie. I find it hard to tell what is important in Eyes Wide Shut. Is it the dream vs. reality narrative? Is it the lust? The power of the ultra-rich? Something unseen and unsaid? Or, more likely, a combination of all of these things? There are a few films that are so different than what we're used to that you have to rely on a feeling that what you just watched was special in order to get a grasp on what you think of it. I think 2001 is an example of that but I think Mulholland Dr. is a better example. At the end of both films you basically have no idea what you just watched but, at least in my experience, you're okay with that. You know you're not supposed to get everything. With Eyes Wide Shut I didn't really get that feeling. I went into the film ready to watch something that I would recognize as amazing and ended up let down that I found it to be just alright. I was left with a lot of questions. I think a lot of this feeling can be attributed mainly to a couple of things. One being Nicole Kidman's character. I found too many of her scenes hard to watch. Her slow, monotone dialogue took over nearly every scene she was in and not for the better if you ask me. I understand that it's supposed to be somewhat dream-like but there is just too much of it for my tastes. The other thing that irked me was the theme music. I couldn't help but think that the piano theme was lazy and that is coming from someone who thinks that Kubrick movies have some of the best scores there are. I have a feeling that it was intended to make the viewer uneasy but I wasn't too big a fan of it. Conversely, I thought the framing and lighting were immaculate, as expected. Cinematography is not something you have to worry about with Kubrick. The acting was pretty good, including that of Kidman, I just had a problem with her character. The story was compelling and thought-provoking but that is more due to the source material than the film itself. The liberties that the movie takes with the source material is what has kept me thinking of it for the past few days and I think a film that is on your mind for days after (in a non-negative way) deserves some credit just for that. I am about as confused as I've been after watching a movie and I have a feeling that my qualms were intended but at this point they are mostly lost on me. The film is often thought of as misunderstood and I probably agree but, at this point in time, I don't find it to be a masterpiece.",6,2,3,28 March 2019
Pulp Fiction," A Masterpiece
","This is one of the few movies that I have to watch almost every time it's on. It's just so good. Everything about it is great. It's completely absurdist but it's authentic to that absurdity. Every second contributes to the building of the world in a way that comes off as the opposite of contrived. It doesn't focus on any single character but instead focuses on the story itself. That's not to say that the film doesn't contain some of the best characters that there has ever been on screen. The characters are portrayed in such a way that the story is seen as a natural product of their beings. The movie is technically amazing. It is able to so easily master long drawn-out single camera takes as well multi-camera quick cuts. Everything is perfectly timed and everything has a purpose. Pulp Fiction is seen as Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece and it is for very good reason, it's one of the best films of all time.",9,0,0,2 April 2019
Joker," The Joker Doesn't Need to be an Anti-Hero
","There wasn't really anything that made me believe that Phoenix was the Joker other than his makeup and laugh. He's the proto-Joker, I guess, but still I don't see much of a resemblance. I'm not a fan of the comics and I don't know all of the lore behind the Joker but this take on the character seems to me like an attempt at making something as serious and gritty as The Dark Knight without the success. There isn't much complexity to a character and story that warrants complexity. The motivations of most characters don't make sense and the Joker just becomes cool out of nowhere towards the end of the movie.",4,3,15,7 November 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Watch For The Special Effects
","I have a soft spot for Godzilla but I did not expect much of this movie when I started it. I expected bad writing, poor acting and over the top special effects. Well, I got all three of those things but the over the top special effects ended up being what made the movie watchable. The story didn't make much sense and the acting was laughable at times but the special effects were some of the best that I have ever seen. And the fact that they were so over the top made it possible for them to be the main focus of the film. Seriously, whenever I wasn't enjoying a particular scene of dialogue some completely preposterous action scene that was expertly crafted would steal my attention. The explosions, Kong, the MUTOS, everything looked amazing. Other than that the movie was pretty bad but the special effects were so good that it was positive viewing experience. I'm also a sucker for Vera Lynn.",6,1,1,3 April 2019
Parasite," 'It's so metaphorical'
",A good movie with no jarring flaws. The only trouble I have with it is that it could've been better. I'm guessing a lot of the film's subtlety is lost in translation because I wasn't overly impressed by all of the metaphors. I feel like I got a firm grasp of everything that went on and what it meant while I was watching and it hasn't left much of a lasting impression on me. I could be failing to see things but I wish it was a bit more dense. I kind of think the movie is a little overrated and think that some people like it so they can say they like foreign films.,7,3,11,10 February 2020
Black Panther," Just another superhero movie
","Black Panther is a joke of a movie. Killmonger was the least insane person in it and they killed him because he told the truth then took his ideas and passed them on as their own. These people hide the secrets to prosperity away from the world and call anyone who doesn't live with them an 'outsider'. They determine their leaders via either birthright or by combat (extremely advanced stuff from the Wakandans). Maybe if they didn't just pick the strongest guy they could have had a leader with morals make some positive changes to the world, instead their xenophobia causes them to sit and watch people suffer and die all over but they choose to save a hobbit just because. Then the hobbit flies a plane-ship simulation and takes out Killmonger's aerial force by himself and all this time another ship is trying to kill him. The movie sets it up as a life or death decision for Mr. Baggins; choose to stay in the simulation and die fighting or leave and let the enemy win. He chooses to stay and fight but somehow gets out in the nick of time anyways; just a complete waste of time to even present the illusion of risk. Oh, and how the hell is the hobbit supposed to know how much time he has left when he's told 'shields are at 50%', what does that even mean? Black Panther is stabbed in the abdomen and thrown off a waterfall but survives because a fisherman finds him and puts him in a snow bank. Killmonger decides to burn the flower that gives him power for some reason that still escapes me. There are so many plot holes that I was questioning my own ability to comprehend story structure. I'd rather not even get started on the War-Rhinos. The use of CGI was liberal to say the absolute least. Of course, there were some parts that looked cool but there were way more parts that you could tell were shot in front of a green screen. Most of the accents are terrible and almost none of the actors/actresses offer anything in terms of emotion. I would say it's a shame some smarter nation is going to take advantage of them and their Vibranium but it's really not, they deserve it. Then again Wakanda does have deus ex machina on their side so they'll probably be alright.",4,5,7,23 January 2019
The Deer Hunter," A Different Type of War Movie
","The Deer Hunter is a different war film than most. There aren't any battles or last stands or any of the typical war games. Instead, it is a look at the people involved and a look into a particular piece of culture associated with the Vietnam War. Clocking in at over 3 hours, this felt like a long movie to me. Parts of it were overlong (like all the pre-deployment stuff, particularly the wedding) and other parts were long enough to get the viewer understand the gravity of the situations that are unfolding on screen. The length of the film worked both for and against it. There is some cheesiness that I didn't enjoy like the random breaks into song, specifically the 'God Bless America' at the end came off a little too propaganda-ish for me. However, what carries the film is the psychological effects the war has on the characters and how compelling the Russian Roulette scenes are. Both of these are mostly products of the actors. De Niro, Walken and some of the Vietnamese characters are fantastic. The decision to focus on Russian Roulette is also an interesting one because it's one of the only things that can compare to war in terms of limits of the human experience. The stakes are so high already but when it's put on top of war it becomes something else entirely. The climax of the film is one of the darkest that I have seen. There is also something to be said that this film was made not when Vietnam was a memory like most films we know but instead while it was still a relatively fresh scar on the American populace.",8,0,0,3 April 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Different but great
","An entertaining and comedic take on the absurdity of war and in particular the end of the second World War. I can imagine, in today's environment, how a lot of people felt watching Hitler make jokes but I thought that and other things that I'd guess people took offense to were in-line with the message of the film. The world needs more films that are willing to take risks.",8,1,2,26 March 2020
The Matrix," A Thought-Provoking but Outdated Technical Display
","Unfortunately, I never got around to watching this movie before it was outdated which it is now. That is probably a function of its massive success and cultural impact but it's the truth. Everyone knows what it means when someone leans back and waves their arms in slow motion so those kind of moments of awe were lost on me. The story (outside of the background) is corny and the acting is bad but I can understand why it was seen as important when it came out. It took a lot of risks but only a few of the stand the test of time. What it really is is a technical display and those age as technology advances.",5,0,2,8 March 2019
Green Book," A Step Above the Traditional Buddy Comedy
","This movie is a buddy comedy with some serious circumstances thrown in it. It has the typical story where two people from wildly different backgrounds are forced to be together and eventually overcome their differences to become lifelong friends. We've seen it so many times before that we know what is going to happen when we see the movie poster. In that sense, it is nothing new and nothing special. What I think puts this film a step above the rest is the acting. Specifically, Viggo Mortensen. I think he does a very nice job of playing the cliche endearing scumbag. He's funny but competent and that does a lot for the movie. Mahershala Ali also does a decent job but I don't think it's anything special. He does well with the limited range that the script allows. Since the film is centered almost entirely around them, it is entertaining and able to keep your attention. However, not all of the acting was good. The more the Italian family was in the film, the worse it got. It's just so uncomfortable watching such a cliche loud Italian family. Other transgressions that I think the film commits include Mortensen's character having contradictory views on race and the frequent contrived teaching points. These types of things are expected in this kind of movie but that doesn't make them any less diminishing. Overall, it is a decent film that almost overcomes it's genre.",6,2,3,1 February 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick Does What John Wick Wants
","I'm really enjoying this franchise. From the subjective editing to the badassery of John Wick, both movies so far have been a delight to watch. The reason that I've found both enjoyable is because they are very similar. In fact, I would say that everything the first movie got right, this movie also got right, just to a slightly lesser extent because the 'wow' factor that came with the first one has worn off a bit. The narrative in the first was more compelling than the sequel but this story was still interesting. I really like how the odds against John keep multiplying but he could not care less (as is perfectly portrayed by the monotonous Keanu Reeves). The only real negative about the film is that, I think, the overall aesthetic could become overused if the team behind the scenes don't make any changes. I'm very excited for the third movie because I feel that the end of the second set it up pretty well.",7,0,1,10 April 2019
Jackie Brown," Character-Driven Tarantino
","In many ways this film is typical but also atypical Tarantino. Nothing in the film is anything outside the realm of possibility for pre-Jackie Brown Tarantino but it's much different than his previous work. For one, the narrative is mostly linear or at least relatively linear. This compounded with the fact that the plot isn't as dense as his other work makes for a much easier story to follow. Some of the details do become a bit muddled but it isn't a serious problem. The film is defined by its characters moreso than its plot. The characters make the movie more engaging than the plot does, in my opinion. The characters are great. They're entertaining but it's not quite enough to carry the film up to the quality of its predecessors, for me.",7,0,0,12 August 2019
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," So Dumb It's Genius
","It's not easy for me to imagine how hilarious this must've been when it first came out because I watched it for the first time 44 years after; long after its influence had already cemented itself in the worlds of comedy and cinema. Parts of it are still laugh-out-loud funny but some parts also come off as played-out because of how many times the certain trope or line of dialogue has been used since its release. For example, I could see myself laughing my ass of at the Black Knight scene but I'd seen the 'flesh wound' meme so many times that I already knew what was happening. But, there were parts that did have that effect on me like the witch scene or any part to do with swallows. The nonsense humor, that I think was unheard of before this, is genius. The film is very funny and I can only wish to have seen it earlier to get the full effect.",7,2,3,15 July 2019
Incredibles 2," Pixar Tries To Keep a Good Thing Going
","Incredibles 2 is a decent, entertaining watch. It is not as good as the first but I don't think many people expected it to be. The animation is as great and the characters are engaging, as expected. The problem is that the story isn't as compelling as the original. It didn't feel like much was happening, honestly. Most of the family is doing normal stuff for most of the movie while Elastigirl and Jack Jack take center stage. The film doesn't take many risks and it suffers because of that. Clearly, there will be a third Incredibles movie but Pixar may have hurt future audiences' expectations by trying to not mess anything up with this sequel.",6,1,1,19 February 2019
Inside Llewyn Davis," The Coens Made a Regular Film
","I enjoyed watching this movie. The narrative is interesting and engaging. The characters are mostly well-portrayed. The songs are decent but dry which is understandable given that it's only meant to be heard once or twice. There are a few moments that were as clever or intriguing as anything the Coen Brothers have done but there is an overall lack of subtlety for most of the movie that is uncharacteristic of their films. It doesn't really feel like a Coen Brothers movie but more like a regular story about a folk singer; an enjoyable one but nothing too special. The story does has its twists and turns and ambiguities but the film, as a whole, didn't stick in my mind after the way that I had hoped it would.",7,0,0,22 July 2019

","This is the best action film that I've ever seen. I love everything about it. The visuals are absolutely stunning and the special effects are up there with the best of the best. But, what really takes Mad Max to the next level is its subtlety. It uses subtlety in a way that not too many other films can, let alone action films. Sure, there is some dialogue that is too blatant in its goal to move the story forward but most of the world-building and plot movement comes not from dialogue but from everything else. The all-out action, the changes in scenery and the characters' general demeanor all help shape the world that the movie takes place in and tell the story. This is a credit to everyone involved in the film. Everything is done so well. The visuals, sound, acting, directing, everything. This not just a ridiculous two hour long car chase, this is a masterpiece.",9,1,4,17 April 2019
