Lucky Number Slevin," Fantastic fast paced movie
",Great movie. Awesome cast. Awesome stylising. Awesome one liners. Really different plot; written in a mix of common prose and poem. Watched it multiple times and would highly recommend.,10,0,0,9 September 2018
Us," Very poor with some positives
","Bits were brilliant, others atrocious. The plot was very indulgent with so many holes in it that it became an embarrassment to the JP legacy. It felt like a group of stoned, amateur film students all pitching in, as a chaotic-committee, for the content. Otherwise, nice cast and some good one-liners.",3,8,15,24 March 2019
Life Is Beautiful," Make you laugh, cry and think
",Emotional rollercoaster. Beautifully scripted and played out. Made me laugh out aloud and even cry. Motifs are simple yet deep. One of my favourite movies and would certainly recommend.,10,0,1,9 September 2018
