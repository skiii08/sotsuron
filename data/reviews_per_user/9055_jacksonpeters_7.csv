First Man," Visually Stunning and Emotional Biopic 10/10
","First Man doesn't just tell the story of Neil Armstrong getting to the moon but also the Armstrong family and the effect that getting to the moon had on them. The visuals in the movie are stunning and even though you think you may already know what will happen next it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie also has a deep emotional side to it, which adds to the greatness of the movie.Congratulations to Damien Chazelle, is there anything this man can't do. Also an outstanding performance from Ryan Gosling and Claire Foys portrayal as Janet Armstrong really puts you in her shoes and makes you think how she felt about her husband going on this giant adventure. The soundtrack is also fantastic and fits perfectly with the tone of the movie. This movie will become a classic!!!",10,9,20,14 October 2018
Us," ORIGINAL HORROR!!!
","I saw this movie on opening night and what I can say is just ignore all the negative reviews about Us, this film was a blast from beginning to end. It will have you on the edge of your seats and also has parts of humour in it as well. Terrific acting from Lupito Nyongo who plays both Adelaide and Red. Jordan Peele is becoming the new master of horror and thriller and his ideas are so original. The movie also has a killer (creepy) soundtrack. Go see this movie you won't be disappointed.",9,39,84,23 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," GREAT FUN TO WATCH, IGNORE THE 1 STARS!!!
","The Rise of Skywalker isn't the terrible film that everyone's making it out to be. It may not be the best in the saga but nonetheless it's still a strong entry and a fitting ending to the 42 year franchise.The film is action packed from start to finish and has parts of humour throughout. You'll love some of the new characters that are introduced in the film and there are also some shocks, twists and turns that you may not see coming. As a life long Star Wars fan I can see why some people are left disappointed but it doesn't deserve the deeply negative reviews that it's receiving.I had a blast watching the film at a midnight showing and although it isn't my favourite film from the saga, I already can't wait to go and see it again. Go and see the film for yourself and make your own opinion on the film.",8,5,10,20 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," All aboard this EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER
","I've just got back from watching Endgame at a UK midnight release and I'm lost for words. This film had me laughing in hysterics and put a huge grin across my face during some unbelievable scenes. It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and made my spine tingle and then also left me in an emotional wreck. No one will be ready for what they're about to see but what a ride it was, it's up there with Infinity War, if not better as it completes the whole 22 film Infinity Saga. The Russos are amazing, everyone of their MCU films are pretty much flawless, fantastic job guys.... WE'RE IN THE ENDGAME NOW!!!!",10,1,4,25 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," BLOCKBUSTER OF THE YEAR!!!
","This is my first review on here so gonna keep it short and simple. I saw Avengers Infinity War at the midnight showing and it was so worth it, the film exceeded all my expectations and as soon as the credits rolled, I wanted to watch it again. Full of laughs and shocking moments that you won't see coming. This is one of the best superhero films ever made, GO AND WATCH IT!!! I'll be going watching this again at the cinema, no doubt about it.",10,1,2,26 April 2018
1917," A MASTERPIECE & AN INSTANT CLASSIC
","1917 is truly on a whole other level from start to finish. Sir Sam Mendes has created something special with this 'one shot' movie, that will have you on the edge of your seats. I found my heart beating out my chest in some scenes and the hairs on the back of my neck stand up in others.Roger Deakins' cinematography is absolutely beautiful, combined with Thomas Newman's score, just adds to the massive scale of this film. The film has everything, action, drama, humour and emotional scenes and truly deserves all the awards it's receiving.",10,8,12,11 January 2020
It Chapter Two," CGI Will Never Be Scary!!!
","It Chapter 2 is an okay film, however if I'd known before I went to watch it then I'd have just waited till it came out on video/bluray and rented or borrowed it. It just wasn't worth the money.I thought it was just the exact same as the first one but longer and more boring. The film felt like it was being dragged out. There was a few one liners from Bill Hader's character Richie, but most of them were out of place. James McAvoy's performance was also okay. The CGI in the film ruined it for me because it just wasn't scary or frightening and was quite comic at times.The third act was just a big CGI mess and also went on for too long. I hope they don't make anymore prequels, sequels or whatever in the future because this film was a major let down.",6,3,4,7 September 2019
