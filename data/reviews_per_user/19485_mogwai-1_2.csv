Requiem for a Dream," 10 out of 10. Unquestionably.
","This is, quite simply, the best film I have ever seen. Horrific, hypnotic, beautiful, disturbing, real and dreamlike. Darren Arnofsky has taken his filmmaking to another level here. The closest comparison, stylistically, is David Fincher's Fight Club (see the jail sequences in Requiem, the lightning-speed editing, steadicam, etc.). Thematically, well I suppose Last Exit To Brooklyn, obviously, and maybe Pleasantville, as in the becoming-one-with-your-television thing. Ellen Burstyn is, even by her own standards, incredible. Jennifer Connelly, it is almost impossible to believe after watching this film, was the girl in Labyrinth. These characters have no rock star friends or helpful entourage to bring them back from the edge; they are on their own, and it shows.What an ending.What a score (possibly the greatest theme ever written).What direction.What a film.How do you top this one?I think only Darren Arnofsky has the answer.",10,0,0,21 February 2001
Taxi Driver," The best performance by an actor in any film ever.
","What can I say about Taxi Driver that hasn't already been said?It's directed faultlessly, by possibly (probably) the greatest director in the history of cinema.Robert de Niro? 11 out of 10.Paul Schrader? Likewise.Thelma Schoonmaker? Ditto.Jodie Foster? Her best performance.Cybill Shepherd? It could only go downhill from here.Brilliantly scripted, brilliantly directed (see: the scene with Travis on the phone, when the camera pans down the hallway; the shooting scene; everything, actually), brilliantly acted. In a word : brilliant.",10,1,2,21 February 2001
