Hereditary," Never pay to watch this
",Very slow. We all laughed out loud at one scene. Some of the acting was atrocious but nowhere near as bad as the storyline. The ending was pathetic leaving us asking what we had just wasted our time on. The rating would have been lower but I didn't see a zero option.,1,2,5,27 October 2018
