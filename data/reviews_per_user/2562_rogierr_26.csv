Vertigo," probably never want to see it again, here's why...
","My favourite Hitchcock films are (not having seen Psycho yet): Notorious, Rebecca, Rope and North by northwest.  Notice the absence of Vertigo and Rear window?  (Two are even from his Selznick-dominated era).  Indeed, Vertigo is not one of my favourites.  Hitchcock isn't one of my favourites at all.  Everybody wants to be Hitchcock's biggest fan, but I am not everybody. Some IMDb-users want nicknames like Hitch or even Hitchy as if they were close friends.  Hmm.  Wouldn't it be easy to conform to the majority and try to find ANYTHING appealing in Vertigo?  It may be technically and aesthetically flawless, but there is nothing really special in this personal piece.  Absolutely NO rough edges.Hitchcock makes a gesture at the narrow-minded audiences all over the world again as always.  That's why we can say: 'I'm going to see a Hitchcock!', and everybody knows what we mean.  That makes me a bit itchy.  It also explains why Hitchcock's films are so over-rated: they are appreciated very well ON AVERAGE.  Nobody really wants to admit that they didn't like a Hitch they just saw (try to imagine these statements with Bunuel's films in mind...).  Well, e.g. 'the Birds' (1963) rates 4 in my list.The 'vertigo-effect' of zooming out and riding the camera forward isn't new at all (saw that in a '30s movie once).  However it was used extremely appropriately here.  The best element of Vertigo is the visualization of the psychology (obsession) in the story.  But if you want to see really interesting films about obsession see 'Obsession' (1949, Dmytryk, written by Alec Coppel ! - a must see with music by Nino Rota (Godfather, Amarcord)). And 'Ossessione' (1946, Visconti), 'Les Enfants Terribles' (1950, Melville) or even 'Abre los ojos' (1997, Amenabar, with very clear vertigo-references).  Great films with rough edges about psychological problems are Suture (McGehee&Siegel, 1993), Seconds (Frankenheimer, 1966) and Fight Club (Fincher, 1999).Where would cinema be if Hitchcock had never directed ONE film?  In my opinion exactly where it is now.  No hard feelings though.  I enjoy a Hitch too every once in a while.  But after three attempts I don't think I want to see the sluggish Vertigo ever again.Still rates 7/10 :-)",Null,1,7,1 August 2001
Come and See," unremitting graphical terror and accumulating atrocities
","Elem Klimov and Aleksei Rodionov's handheld cinematography, present the viewer with the mental and physical destruction of a boy who changes in front of your eyes beyond recognition.Cacophoneous, industrial sounds and sometimes cryptic story-elements (for as far as there is a story) contribute to this ruthlessly escalating history lesson about Nazi's who burned down hundreds of villages in 1943 in Russia. The realism makes you wonder how many people were harmed making the film, while the score represents the mindnumbing experiences of Florya, a tour-de-force performance by Aleksei Kravchenko (16 at the time).  All along, somehow Klimov knows very well how to prevent the audience from becoming numb.ILM's specialFX are smoother, but the FX here in 'Come and see' are so realistic, it's almost unreal: reminiscent of the first 30 min of Saving private Ryan, Thin red line (watch the animals), Apocalypse Now and the painstaking 'Band of brothers'.  Indeed forget about the rest of 'SPR', Platoon and even Full Metal Jacket.  However, I would like to recommend Deer Hunter (Cimino, 1978) and Hotaru no haka (1988).  But I never suspected there was something massive like this.  10/10",Null,66,91,17 January 2002
Monty Python's Life of Brian," grab a firm hold of your socks, because you will laugh them off
","On one hand, it's more complex than 'the Holy Grail' that I do not consider a religious satire, but more like a satire on tales of knights, compared with 'Life of Brian'.  On the other hand there is the uncomplicated controversy 'sex, sex, sex that's all they think about' in a supposedly medieval way.  But of course the lavatorial humour is only there to lighten up the more concerned and clever jokes, like the mockery of the stoning, feminism, the gladiators, the crucifixions, the self-chastisement, the bargaining nonsense, the supposed superiority of the Romans (Biggus Dickus et al) and the repressing of Jews.  Religious viewers who don't have much stamina could have a cardiac arrest when watching this film I guess.  But under all the mockery MP have a very sharp knowledge of the bible, philosophy and events that 2001 years ago took place (or what is believed by certain religious groups) and don't really get anti-clericist.Without George Harrison this 'hand made film' would not have been possible. I see it twice a year to remind me of the craziness of religious herding, stalking and hypocrisy.  And also to remember to always look on the bright side of life.  Do not make your history homework: watch this instead!  The only time MP got carried away really is with the alien spaceship, which is childish and not important.  What is important, are the settings and decors, which are more convincing than those of 'Gladiator' (Scott, 2000) and 'the Last temptation of Christ' (Scorsese, 1988) as far as I'm concerned.  BTW, how would Kirk Douglas in Spartacus (Kubrick, 1960) have performed the the famous song at the end of the film?  Anyway, MP perform 40 (fourty) brilliant roles with just them six and that might just be the biggest gag of the film.Strange, that 'Life of Brian' is considered one of the best comedies ever and Buñuel's 'Simón of the desert' (1965) and 'the Milky Way' (1969) are almost not known at all.  Let's just blame it on the subtitles.  On its turn, Life of Brian might partially have been an inspiration for 'Army of Darkness' (Raimi, 1992).  My favourite line by Simón del Desierto: 'I'm beginning to realize that I don't realize what I'm saying.  What am I saying?'  So satisfy your curiosity and try these films: what are you waiting for ... Christmas?  10/10",Null,1,4,24 December 2001
Fight Club," Separate the cynicism from the sincere in this one.
","It could be nice to construct this comment the same macabre and ironic way the movie was done, but I won't.I went to see this movie in a theater only months after its release, because I thought it would be some kind of Van Damme flick about streetfighters. However, I heard that it was a good movie from some respected friends.  So finally I saw it and wished I did earlier.  The movie title couldn't be more wrong.  This is NOT a flat BudSpencer/TerenceHill flick about people hitting each other over the head.  No reactionary or fascist ideas and not a gladiator flick either.  The story is actually about people searching for completeness and the futile need for material things and above all about presence of mind.  The quest for reality (and luck) simply runs out of control.It's a great cinematic experience: some CGI but very appropriately used. Don't let the number of visual FX crew members (42! +10 for special FX) fool you: it really doesn't get overdone.  However, some visual insider jokes are probably best appreciated by professionals and filmschool students (which I am not).  I simply cannot wait to see the next movie by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and, of course, David Fincher.You're probably not 'complete' until you have seen this movie.  But watch it with a critical eye, I might add, because the irony and cynicism must be separated from the sincere.  David Fincher makes any Hitchcock look like greasy kid stuff.  This is probably the superlative of any Hitchcock movie. Fincher seems to dictate Hollywood already.Why o why can't we vote 11 :((",Null,1,3,24 June 2001
Memento," fantastic unconventional thriller without pretensions
","Some argue that you get the trick of the flick after a few minutes and that's it.  What a boloney!  After that it only gets better (horror? suspense?).  Don't look for a message in this fantastic thriller (apart perhaps from: make an allowance for the disabled).  I'm not going to write much about it, because I'm walking a thin line of getting this off my chest and spoiling the fun for anybody who didn't see it.  Very decent acting!

Catch-22," sophistry of logic and lunacy of war
","Nichols caught sophistry of logic and lunacy of war on film.  He does not take you by the hand through Heller's realm.  We are scarcely guided by music.  It will not come AT you.  Except for the ominous roaring of the bombers, the excellent cinematography, and all-star cast (with justice). Many fabulous background details, surrealistic flashbacks, and stupefying conversations: where MASH (1970) is good Catch-22 (1970) is brilliant and it's still under-valued after 31 years.  Probably because we're used to being flooded with easy-to-digest crap. Cpt. Yossarian tries to be recognized as being crazy, but he is probably the only sane soldier in the world.  Orr is he?  After the eighties and the early nineties, todays audiences should again be able to appreciate non-straightforward cinema.  Could this be 'Alan in Wonderland'?  'A very few good men' maybe?  'Dr. Verystrangelove'? Aware of the fact that it would probably take 9 sequels to catch all the contents of Heller's anti-war novel, Henry and Nichols together with David Watkin make a fine selection and create a masterpiece.

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," After this film I dreamed black dreams about black sheep
","The best cold-war film there is.  It's a hilarious nightmare about the escalating arms race (and its consequences), in which Peter Sellers is obviously brilliant and George C. Scott is hilariously funny.  Is it a coincidence that the book 'Red Alert' was written by Peter George? (could it have been Scott Sellers who wrote it?) Also, this is the best performance by Sterling Hayden (Asphalt Jungle, The Killing) I've seen so far.  He has to be one of my favourite villains ever.  I saw this film by accident at 2 a.m. on my own and I couldn't control my (hilarious) emotions and imagination, so I probably woke up some neighbours by laughing.  I simply watched it in one breath and dreamed about mushrooms. Those where black dreams about black sheep I assure you!  BTW 'Two hours to doom' doesn't apply completely to this satire, because the film unfortunately only takes 93 minutes, but those were the best spent 93 minutes of my life. The cinematographer Gilbert Taylor (Repulsion, Star Wars) and ofcourse Kubrick make it possible to watch this film again immediately after you saw it, simply to see the whole thing start and escalate again.Why o why can't we vote 11  :(",Null,1,1,3 July 2001
Alien," convincing space-opera as well as a character study
","Has this become an all-star cast because the movie is brilliant or is the movie so good because the actors are great?  I think both.  Seven (plus a hairy quadruped) tour-de-force performances make it a convincing space-opera as well as a fantastic character study.  I particularly like the interaction between Yaphet Kotto (Midnight Run, 1988) and Harry Dean Stanton (Paris Texas, 1984) as opportunistic engineers.  I saw this film every year in the past 15 years, and that will definitely continue for decades.  Since that first time I tend to compare every SF and every horror movie with this one, but just recently I realized that it's an unfair race against this horror-milestone.  Ridley Scott builds up the pace towards the end and doesn't spill his guts (at once) so you aren't able to take your eyes off the screen. This has the most intellectual plot (and coolest plot-twists) of all four alien-films: one of the key elements (why do they wake up in the first place?) of the film is the moral dilemma faced by commercial corporations anywhere to sacrificing employees in order to make more money or to make less profits in order to serve humanity.  Strangely enough, the two SF masterpieces Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) made are also his only two intellectual achievements.Here's one of the greatest movie scores of all time by Jerry Goldsmith (the Omen, Chinatown, L.A. Confidential), because it's subtle and instantly recognizable.  As is the art direction, which was not only flawlessly executed here by Les Dilley and Roger Christian, but could also not be surpassed by any SF-horror without computer animations until now, and by which this genre stands or falls.  No need to mention the concept artists. Derek Vanlint (cinematography) also puts his stamp upon the film very carefully.  The nerve-wrecking hand-held scenes are also used to make the all-time scariest theatrical trailer you've ever seen.  I hope there'll be no computer-animations in part five, for they could not compete with this art and are probably more expensive too.Beware of Alien-wannabees like 'Pitch Black' and 'Leviathan' (entertaining though).  If you liked this you should not miss Aliens, which is more of an adrenalized war-movie but does NOT disappoint.Why o why can't we vote 11 :(",Null,1,3,13 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," George Lucas read&watched LordOfTheRings closely and learned
","Ep2 has a more distinguished place in history of cinema than Ep1, 5 and 6, without being groundbreaking.  There are numerous cliche-scenes, old-fashioned costumes, and the directing overall was conventional.  But of course, that's why we go and see a Star Wars movie.  Lucas definitely did not let us down.  Anybody who wants 2 C art should look further.  All the references to other classic scifi-movies are great.  To name a few: Blade Runner (noir feel of the dark side, rain, robots who want to live, air traffic), Metropolis (dehumanised workers, air traffic), Matrix (computercontrolled breeding of human beings), Robocop (Jango Fett), Starship Troopers (massive action scenes), Gladiator (arena fights), LOTR1 (fantasy politics, good vs evil forces) and basically most movies based on stories by Philip K. Dick.  Yes, even A.I. (coldness, boy looking for mama). W/o the ethical questions that is, and w/o intelligence.After the first 45 min I was afraid that Ep2 was turning into some kind of Star Trek, but luckily I was wrong and treated with magnificent action mostly in the latter half of the movie.  And the lightsaber-battles have become delightfully more convincing.  The star wars are back!  A much heard complaint about the unfinished storylines in Ep2 is a very weak one, because nobody complained about unfinished storylines in LOTR 1 did they? Everyone knows the events in Ep3 will be the link between Ep2 (2002) and Ep4 (1977).Great that the annoying Jar Jar Binks has almost vanished from the story. Let's hope he'll be completely removed from Ep3.  Good riddance.  Ep2 is more mature than Ep1, but the 'dark side' is still not all over the movie as promised.  For the first time it does rain though in Star Wars, a lot happens at night time and the evil Christopher 'Saruman' Lee and Temuera Morrison (Once were warriors) contribute to a new sense of evilness that hopefully will stretch far into Ep3.Some complaints: firstly, the CGI animals in the 'Gladiator'-scene are pathetic, because there seems 2 B no neither gravity nor mass and none of the protagonists seems 2 B emotionally affected.  Not even Boba Fett for christ sake, despite he must have suffered the most.  Secondly: are chromatic 30-year-old SR-71's (Blackbird) and 20-year-old B-2's suddenly the airplanes from the future (also in Ep1)?  In Ep2 they don't even have jet engines anymore, but returned to the good old days of conventional engines. But the roaring definitely makes them more impressive.  Third: the 'airtraffic'-scene in the beginning of the movie was uninvolving and not new too (Fifth Element, Blade Runner).  Fourth: 'Ep2 - attack of the clones' is NOT the first completely digitally shot movie as Lucas likes to believe: that was Vidocq (2001).Ep2 is entertaining enough to be 180 min though.  The music has become somewhat more subtle in my opinion and does more justice to the storyline than in Ep1 and Ep6.  The CGI and the action scenes almost surpass LOTR1 (never the art direction) and the acting was WAY better than in the callow Ep1.  The humor is still a bit childish.  Let's say Ep2 is the puberty of Star Wars and let's hope Ep3 will be grown up (not too much though ;-). Don't expect much more than thrilling action, scifi and fantasy in Ep2: 8/10.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," ultimate fantasy/adventure w/o excessive morality and unwanted humour
","I haven't read any of Tolkien's books, but I guess he couldn't be disappointed by this exhilarating (this is one of the few films that really deserve that word) craftmanship.  Peter Jackson (Heavenly Creatures, Braindead) confirms with LOTR1 that he can entertain audiences w/o excessive morality or annoying humour (not that any of his other films fail at that) and seamless sews the climaxes, violence and serenity together. Cinematographer Andrew Lesnie (Mad Max 2, Babe) knows how to handle Jackson's (virtually impossible) dynamic camera fantasies and keeps it far more aestethic than e.g. Indiana Jones (another exhilarating adventure) at the same time, w/o being groundbreaking and w/o christmas messages (except something like: 'use the time that was given to you wisely').The film shouldn't be any shorter, but isn't there supposed to be more bloodiness here and there?  Furthermore, there are some ugly mistakes in the CGI, but the art direction more than makes up for that with the design of armour and monsters.  Idyllic landscapes, huge (but meticulous) sets and terrifying monsters define a world that smashes movies like 'The Matrix' and even 'Time Bandits' to smithereens.  I guess I'll see it a second time this winter.Most of the cast can draw from their experience (and image) in good horror movies (except Elijah 'angel face' Wood): Ian Holm (Alien), Christopher Lee (Sleepy Hollow, Dracula '66), Ian McKellen (Gods and monsters), Liv Tyler is a Heavenly creature (didn't play in that Jackson movie though), and Cate Blanchett still has the Gift.  Already looking for LOTR (VG)?  Try Diablo2, Quake1 and especially Unreal1.  What good things have you heard about this film?  Yep, it's all that and more (part 2&3) in the pipeline.  10/10: WingNut rules more than ever.",Null,0,0,20 December 2001
Apocalypse Now," a mission into moral terror: not the average war adventure
","Vittorio Storaro (Il Conformista, Reds, Last Emperor) here did his best cinematography ever.  The atmosphere he created with Coppola will stay with you forever.  Not to forget the integration of music: it's like a ballet on experimental sounds and contemporary rock.  That's what makes this more of a hallucinating adventure into a darkened heart ('Horror and moral terror are your friends.') than an a fast-pace war-movie about some horrifying experiences or.  This is art.  I liked Martin Sheen in Catch-22 as Dobbs, but this is the most intriguing part he ever did. He himself seems to be hallucinating (apart from the booze) as he learns about what's going on around him and what his mission is about: 'The bulls..t piled up so fast in Viet-Nam, you needed wings to stay above it.'  Marlon Brando wasn't great (although his character is terrifying and he looks great) in this film, but I felt Laurence Fishburne (Cotton Club, Matrix) was more interesting with his disarming performance. Surprisingly, Robert Duvall is the comic (hilarious?) relief as the virtually untouchable Kilgore.  I don't think Orson Welles could have done greater work directing this one (novel by Joseph Conrad) than Coppola.  Zoetrope rules.  And I haven't even seen the extra 53 minutes yet!

Aliens," a sequel but still better than any Star Wars
","So here we have the adrenalized version of Alien: it's a high-paced war-movie.  The cautious civillian characters are simply replaced by macho soldiers.  One of the best sequels ever, yet not surpassing Alien in many ways. First the cast is not brilliant: it's made great by the cinematography, the editing and mainly the directing, which has become something of a trademark of Cameron.  Secondly, some key elements of the first film are copied (except the intellect), e.g. the entrepreneurial dilemma.  That does not mean that the rest of the plot isn't fantastic: the story builds up gradually and explodes even further than Alien (including plot-twists). Third, the aesthetics are gone.  All the subtle details from Alien are replaced by funky eye-catchers.  But then again that doesn't diminish the reality of what's going on.  It does explain why Aliens has more votes than Alien though.  Finally, Aliens keeps up with the times and is definitely one of the 10 best SF-movies ever made.  As far as I'm concerned this still surpasses every Star Wars episode there is: this is not just greasy kid-stuff!  Did you know that the aliens are actually crossbreedings of the Terminator and E.T., as is Johnny Five (Short Circuit, 1986) ?  Also see Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein and Bill Paxton in Near Dark (1986!, stylish horror). 10 out of 10, where Alien is 11 out of 10 ;-)",Null,0,1,20 June 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," aesthetically grim
","This is a worthy sequel as I enjoyed myself as much as with part 1.  I still haven't read any of the books, but I have to say that the story and plot twists develop in a way I could never have imagined.  Some of it was even reminiscent of 'Throne of Blood' (Kurosawa, 1957) which was of course a brilliant adaptation of MacBeth.  See that film to figure out which parts I mean plz.The art direction is of course still great as they shot the movie together with part 1 and 3.  Here the CGI has become fingerlicking good: Gollum puts Jar Jar Binks AND Yoda to shame!Let's wait for part 3 to drop some concluding remarks about this trilogy. For now it feels great to experience the premieres of these movies and be a part of the hype as well, I might add.    The videogame should be Everquest I guess (never played it though).

Moulin Rouge!," Tous le Soirs: SPECTACLE - CONCERT - BAL
","Three days after standing on Place de Figalle in front of 'le Moulin Rouge' (and bought some of Lautrec's posters as a souvenir), I decided to go and see the movie.  Moulin Rouge! turned out 2 B plain and cliche entertainment. I guess that's what it's supposed 2 B and should be treated like that.  It was a disappointment in general with some good moments and dynamic cinematography.  The point is that it was flat but musical world with round bellies and lots of booze: Burgundian, flamboyant, bohemian, cancan and tragic.  Tragic because the actors didn't have the chance to give the love story (which could have been good) sense.'Smells like teen spirit' (Nirvana), 'Your Song' (Elton John), 'Heroes' (David Bowie), 'One day I'll fly away', 'Roxanne' (Sting) and the inevitable 'The show must go on' (Queen) are examples of the arrangements for the score.  The original songs once are great, but the rest of the movie didn't do much for me.  I can understand the nostalghic feelings for those songs, but that doesn't really contribute to a great movie: it merely sets a firm tone and provides convenient dialogue from songtexts.The exclamation mark should have been removed from the title and especially from the movie itself if you take my meaning.  Neither being a fan of Kidman and McGregor nor of musicals in general, I still say that Kidman and the cinematography deserve 2 B nominated, but no winners as far as I'm concerned.  6/10",Null,0,1,20 February 2002

The story and the b/w cinematography gave the film an appealing indie character and is definitely more interesting for people who were disappointed by 'Hackers' or 'Knight Moves', simply because it lives up to its ambition with not much means.  It is not filled with culture as someone stated.  Good movie though and worth to see again sometime.  7/10 (not including positive discrimination of indies :-)",Null,1,2,20 February 2002
Mulholland Drive," 'everything is prerecorded'
","Lynch leans heavily on the performances of the actors and they truly pull it off.  Naomi Watts initially comes across like a vacuous nurse from 'flying docters' and rapidly shows she is a very talented actress.  Laura Harring did a good job, but Watts is clearly more versatile and subtle.  Mulholland Drive starts as a completely credible story and develops into a genuine David Lynch work of art: enigmatic, cryptic, steamy, surreal, baffling, kind of slow with (unfortunately) terrible music.  Lynch totally forgets about entire parts of the 'plot' and concentrates on the unexpected.  Even some strange (horror) sequences from Eraserhead (1977) are recognizable.Unmistakenly from the director of Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway: not exactly intuitively directed, but I say intuitive viewing is required like when viewing Lost Highway.  Don't try to explain everything that's going on and let the images and surreal editing/developments create the atmosphere of the movie.  Some may say it's arthouse, but IMO it's too accessible for that.  I'd say it's off beat and haunting from beginning to end.  Peter Deming (Lost Highway, Evil Dead 2 !, From Hell) is quickly becoming one of my favourite cinematographers.  Get this guy in 'Visions of light 2' plz.If you thought David Fincher makes mind candy, see Mulholland Dr and think again.  Most people will find this more accessible than Twin Peaks though. Go see it in combination with 'Outer Space' (1999) in the Paradiso theater in Amsterdam.  There are some really annoying and pointless sequences, but I still rate it 9/10 which includes positive discrimination of Lynch, not because I supposedly don't want to admit I didn't understand the movie ;-) This one really made me curious about the way Lynch directs a movie on set.",Null,1,2,3 February 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Once upon a time in the universe: the evolution of tools
","Could it be the biggest practical joke in the history of cinema: to make a very anticipated film (+ novel) about absolutely nothing and see how many people buy it.  Based on the reputation of already illustrious career of Kubrick.  The joke gets funnier when the years go by and before the titular year more than 24000 people voted it here on IMDb.  People keep talking each other into it for decades and MGM and Warner surely aren't the ones to spoil the fun (that is, one of their cash-cows).I think not.Kubrick takes the time to let Clarke's screenplay develop into a mesmerizing masterpiece.  Even by todays standards.  Or should I say especially by todays standards, with all their goofy CGI and not really convincing lightFX?  It has never been more appropriate and better than '2001: a space odyssey'.  Cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth (Superman, Othello '65) and John Alcott (Clockwork Orange).  The fact that there is almost no dialogue is more than compensated by the poetic imagery.  If only I could see it in a theater once!  The story about evolution and technology could just as well have made in another form than a space-opera.  But then there wouldn't be the fenomenon of the first and last space-opera by Kubrick (from whom each film is in no way similar to another) that happens to be the most universal and everlasting SF made in an era when (french) filmmakers denounced cinema dead, would there?  Actually I think the story is about the history of tools invented by homo sapiens.The pace is never high, but just when you think you know what's going on, the setting changes completely.  I don't think there could be any spoilers for this film, because if you tell the complete story it would be just as fantastic and mesmerizing.  But I won't spoil anything.  BTW it was a good choice not to use Gerald Fried for the score, because the film would probably have become dated.2001 is another brilliant work of art from the most versatile director and I had the honor to write this comment in the titular year.

The Graduate," not so much a comedy as it is a time portrait and a film-noir with great music
","The Graduate is more of an intriguing and sometimes tragically light characterstudy than a comedy. But that's not especially why I like this film so much: it's the more or less surrealistic cinematography (Robert Surtees) and the music that does it for me. The Graduate is one of the films (film-noir even) you want to show everyone once you've seen it. Well, maybe not if you need action in every movie. Surtees really was the most important man behind the scenes in this film. Please observe how camera position is chosen, composition of the shot and how he zooms in (over Hofmann's shoulder to Anne Bancroft in the hallway) at very appropriate moments. Moreover, the story is told for a substantial part through the camera itself. He might as well have inspired Vittorio Storaro for 'Il Conformista' (1970, Bertolucci), that also looks like a film-noir very much.I almost could not believe that Mike Nichols' first four films (Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf, The Graduate, Catch-22, Carnal Knowledge) where so brilliant, until I heard that he has been a Broadway director before he started with cinema. That may explain why the dialogues and characters are so convincing and real with their peculiarities. The screenplay by Buck Henry (Catch-22) has not so much the feel of a play, but it could have been very well.Prepare to hear at least two complete songs by Simon/Garfunkel in the film. Garfunkel worked as an actor with Nichols in his next two films (Catch-22 and Carnal Knowledge) that should have been awarded also with some prize. Not many will agree that Graduate is a film-noir on the side, but in my opinion that's more likely than that it is a comedy.Why o why can't we vote 11 :(",Null,1,3,5 July 2001

I couldn't help but recall parts of some greasy Troma VHS-tapes i rented in another life, something to do with Cult Videotheek Amsterdam. T&R used many technical achievements of the old masters of cinema, absolutely fantastic framing combined with vacuous conversations (Are you OK?

Also some was reminiscent of Mad Max and Reservoir Dogs, admitted i never did see Vanishing Point, White Line Fever and Big Wednesday.Be sure to see Death Proof first and Planet Terror afterwards.

A Clockwork Orange," aesthetic perfection and unremitting ghastly
","Alex is one of the worst delinquents you've ever seen, but his treatment is even more deterrent.  The worst punishment by the authorities of a delinquent I could think of was something like solitary confinement or lobotomy.  Until I saw this movie.  Anthony Burgess' ultra-violence (and the old 'in and out') isn't very controversial anymore if you consider the success of Fight Club and many others since Clockwork.  But the message (social problem) is still very important.  It comes in the form of moral terror and science fiction (although you might not even think it's SF after having seen it) but is the best character study I have ever seen.  The question is whose character is studied here: the authorities' or Alex'?  This is definitely Malcolm McDowell's best achievement by far.  He kind of made this into his own movie.  I don't think I could ever take a look at McDowell again without seeing his incorrigible character from this film. Could anybody?  I couldn't help but drop my jaw due to astonishment and admiration when I saw this film a few years ago, although I had seen it ten years before and probably never fully comprehended but remembered every detail.  It's so beautiful (neither idyllic nor romantic!) in any way.  It doesn't need gore and blood n' guts to leave a strong taste.  That is the achievement of cinematographer John Alcott (Shining, Barry Lyndon, No way out) and Kubrick's perfection.  Almost everything in this film is unforgettable: the decor of the film, the slang Alex and his collaborators use (without subtitles probably even incomprehensible), the new interpretation of famous music and the outstanding performances of the rest of the cast.  Kubrick seemed to have touched a wound when he made Burgess' novel into cinema.  While I'm writing this I realise that there is a US mockumentary named Punishment Park (1971!) that has a comparable frightening message. First, Punishment Park is also banned from television (not by it's director but by US government I hear) because of its extremely disturbing imagery. Secondly it is also a denunciation of the punishment of (supposed) delinquents.  Third it is from the same era and in the not so obvious form of SF.  Well, see for yourself if it's comparable, but don't expect the brilliance of Clockwork.I think I have to conclude that this is one of three best films (2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove) by one of my favorite directors.  This film is one of the reasons cinema is my favorite form of art.

Army of Darkness," not just pillowtalk
","Bruce Campbell is captivating (read: decapitating) as ever in this great sequel of Evil Dead 2.  He plays the arrogant hero with unsurpassed facial acrobatics.  'Army' is less experimental, shows off it's big budget and has totally different brilliant action scenes that kept me laughing (hysterically pounding with my feet on the ground).  It has a more solid plot (no matter which version you choose), better actors than The Evil Dead (doesn't actually matter, because Campbell rules anyway, especially when he's on his own), eviscerating art direction, a walnut stock, cobalt blue steel and a haired trigger.But seriously: it was the first movie in the series that I saw ('94) and I was immediately caught up in Raimi's web.  Moreover, I can't resist any movie which features Bruce Campbell since Army.  They both blow the Evil Dead concept to almost epic proportions here.  Cinematographer Bill Pope gloriously continues Peter Deming's stunning work on Evil Dead 2.  E.g. the 'Ash/little Ash' scene in the mill is fabulous.  Unfortunately, the hard-core experimental b-movie appeal is (almost) gone with the arrival of Dino De Laurentiis.  Still, you can call me in the middle of the night to watch it again anytime.  The ultimate recommendations after seeing this one should be Chinese Ghost Story (1987), Braindead (1992) and of course Evil Dead 2 (1987), although The Evil Dead (1982) started all the fun of course. Oh, and the terrible waster Evil Dead Trap (1988) has NOTHING to do with this one.More serious (far-fetched) recommendations about guys trapped in the wrong time/system are: Catch-22 (1970, Nichols) and Brazil (1985, Gilliam) and maybe even Kafka (1991, Soderbergh), Le Procès (1963, Welles).  Warning: the last two are definitely neither meant to be funny nor horror.10 points out of 10 :-)",Null,1,1,8 August 2001
Platoon," powerful but synthetic
","I think this is an important war-movie because the essential elements of the story are historically and personally important and because the many details (art-direction) are historically accurate.  Apocalypse Now and Catch-22 (MY single favourite film of all time) are still ahead of Platoon by a long shot, because they portray the horrors and insanity of war in a much more human AND horrifying way, and don't concern themselves with supposed realism.So, definitely not the best war-movie, but absolutely worth seeing/renting/buying.  It is a movie about supposed experiences of one man and is actually a compilation (as many war-movies) of experiences of different people (mostly Stone's own though).  The cinematography by Robert Richardson (Casino, Salvador) is great, but the acting ('method-directed' !) is not brilliant and the whole is made digestible and cliche; it has not become cliche after Platoon-wannabee-movies, but it was already cliche when it was released in 1986.  Platoon feels synthetic, because it is too picturesque and the music drowns out the emotions and therefore destroys some of the realism, where the music in Apocalypse Now (Coppola, 1979) poetically stresses the horrors and Catch-22 (Nichols, 1970) doesn't need music at all.  Oliver Stone made it digestible when he wanted to show horrifying experiences.  That's its (commercial) power and its weakness.Platoon succeeded however, to reach a VERY large audience.  That couldn't be said of the other two at time of release (don't count the IMDb votes: they don't represent box-office success).  So every war-movie is effective in a way, if only for the director to free himself from terrible memories. Platoon is in that way perhaps similar to 'The Big Red One' (Fuller, 1980), which is from another perspective very off-beat.  Platoon simply came a little bit too late.  Full Metal Jacket (Kubrick, 1987) a little bit more. Not to speak of 'Born on the first of July' (1989).But after all I'm the kind of guy who thinks Saving Private Ryan (1997) was a terrible waste of time, apart from Janusz Kaminski's (Schindler's List, A.I.) great contribution.  Finally, 'Wild Palms' (1993, miniseries) is Stone's most interesting project so far, unfortunately not directed by himself.9/10",Null,1,2,21 July 2001
Blade Runner," Unforgettable film-noir and S.F.
","The greatest film-noir I've ever seen! Also one of my favorite SF (besides Alien and 2001: A space odyssey). And I'm not interested in film-noir purists who don't think Blade Runner fits their criteria list. Director of photography is Jordan Cronenweth, who makes this his definite masterpiece. A good D.P. is important in both genres to get the mood across and Cronenweth definitely raises the standards drastically here (yes I am considering Star Wars). Some people even say that The Matrix (1999) was the first S.F. that did that next. I'm not one of them, but Blade Runner will always be one of MY favorites. I don't think it matters very much whether you see the dir's cut or the other version.It's hard to compare this film with anything else: not even the actors have comparable performances. I think this is the best film by any of them: Rutger Hauer, Harrison Ford, Daryl Hannah, Sean Young etc. Look at it this way: if you don't like any of the cast it's still safe to go and see the film! Together with Alien (1979) this is the only intellectual work and the only S.F. Ridley Scott ever did. I'm still hoping Scott will make another S.F.Be sure to see this film with a good sound system, because the quality of the sound and music (Vangelis) is crucial in this film. In order to achieve that you do want at least an average DVD release but both DVD editions so far are pathetic. It's a disgrace that the copyrights are in hands of Warner :(( But BE sure to see this film!Why o why can't we vote 11 :(",Null,0,0,2 July 2001
Amélie," Jeunet steps out of the dark
","Amélie leaves the macabre and moisty darkness behind and tries to change destiny: born under a bad sign, but coping and helping others while she is on the job.  Not better than Delicatessen (1991) or City of the lost children (1995), but a certainly more accessible story (and not too graphical nudity too).  Strangely it was a summer hit, while it might as well be the ultimate christmas film, because it accomplishes with subtlety what most other christmas movies tried with in-your-face emotions and cliche tear jerking.  None of that here.  There is the subtle mood of surreal intervention with everyday life and virtually impossible camera-angles to accompany the kinetic and dynamic cinematography from Bruno Delbonnel as you might expect from a life that's existent of dreams (disappointments) and coincidences.  Comparable in a way with the appropriate cinematic acrobacy of Fight Club (1999) and the eye-opening imagery of coincidences in Magnolia (1999).  120 minutes seem not to be enough to tell the entire heartwarming story of Amélie.And then: how to cast a woman like Audrey Tautou with eyes like worlds and lips like magic.  Where do you find actresses like that?  Only Liv Tyler (Stealing Beauty, Lord of the Rings) could come close to that.  The cover of the video doesn't do justice to the awardworthy protagonist.9/10",Null,1,3,6 December 2001
Evil Dead II," You'll never quite read Hemingway's 'A Farewell To Arms' the same way again
","Hmm, what adjectives shall I use next? Disturbing? Unsettling? Hilarious? Horrendous? Stupefying? Abject? Tragic? Accessible? Well, this one will force its way into your living room once you start it up, so 'accessible' would be a sore understatement. Neither watch this with your fiancée nor if you're petit-bourgeois, as you learned from the tagline: 'Kiss your nerves goodbye'Hilarious horror can't be better than this, except 'Chinese Ghost Story' and 'Army Of Darkness'. One of the most original films ever made (yes I am considering it is a sequel): it's a genre on its own maybe. If you didn't like The Evil Dead, you will still like Evil Dead 2! It isn't even necessary to have seen 'The Evil Dead' first. The story isn't fantastic, but the pace and the editing are so incredibly fast you will not know where your 84 minutes went. Forget about 'Poltergeist' and 'The people under the stairs'.Sam Raimi really lets himself go and unleashes Bruce Campbell in an unprecedented way. Or should I say unleashes the Evil Dead on Bruce in an unprecedented way? See for yourself. Cinematographer Peter Deming is also a crucial mind behind the eviscerating success of this masterpiece: the lighting and composition are inventive and convincing, but above all extremely dynamic. I can't imagine my life without 'Evil Dead 2' anymore. Yeah, that's right: who's laughing now? Rrrhaaaahhh lovely!10 points out of 10 :-)",Null,0,1,13 July 2001
The Godfather," Neither the best film ever, nor my favourite: the greatest crime flick it is
","Definitely not the greatest movie of all time, but the greatest crime movie it could be. Not only because of the very good and epic story (Mario Puzo), but also because of the aesthetics and fabulous cinematography by Gordon Willis (Annie Hall, Klute). Not to mention the absolutely fantastic cast. It's is impressive that Marlon Brando played the completely different part he did the same year in Bertolucci's 'Ultimo tango a Parigi'. I think it is a pity Sterling Hayden (The Killing, Dr. Strangelove, Asphalt Jungle) had such small part in this nine-hour trilogy.One of the most distinctive elements of this great crime movie is the music, which was already recognizable in 'Rocco e i suoi fratelli' (Visconti, 1960) and was more or less recycled for this film by Nino Rota (Amarcord, Obsession, Boccaccio '70).10 points out of 10 :-)",Null,2,4,31 July 2001
