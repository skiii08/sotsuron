Mission: Impossible III," 3's the charm!
","For those of you who thought that Tom Cruise dropped the ball on 'War of the Worlds'(I am not one of those, I happened to like the movie), be ready to see Cruise carry this ball all the way to the bank! The latest installment of this trilogy is the best one! Tom Cruise turns it up another notch in this movie as the missions appear to be more impossible than ever! I do believe that there will be more missions to come after this one, why not, they only keep better and better as time goes on! Cruise is challenged in this movie like no other time within this trilogy! As with most trilogies, you should see the last 2 installments first to get acquainted with the 'Mission Impossible' team and how proficient they do what they do. Don't miss this one, you'll regret it! A must-see!!!!!!!!",8,2,4,29 May 2006
Alien vs. Predator," This should get you to see this film!
","Considering its 'PG-13' rating, this movie is surprisingly very good!  Being that the previous 'Alien' and 'Predator' movies('Alien', 'Aliens', 'Alien3', 'Alien: Resurrection', 'Predator', 'Predator 2') were all rated 'R', I thought that this movie wouldn't stand up to its predecessors with the 'softer' rating!  I was wrong!  I believe that you have to have seen at least a few of the other movies of both creatures in order to truly appreciate this one(just like 'Freddy vs. Jason')! This movie is packed with the action that only these two beings can generate!  The best way to enjoy this movie is to pick a side, 'Alien' or 'Predator' and see if you're happy with your choice at the end!  No matter who you choose, you will enjoy the battle! A must see movie for fans of the two creatures!  You will not be disappointed, trust me!!!",6,0,0,23 August 2004
Million Dollar Baby," 'Do not confuse this one with 'Rocky'!
","This movie is definitely one of the best, if not the best picture(s) of 2004, and probably one the best pictures I have ever seen! This film is surely one of Clint Eastwood's best pictures ever! The chemistry between the powerhouse talents of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hillary Swank is just extraordinary to say the least! This movie is so full of purpose until it hurts! One of the major components for me in this movie is the fact that it targets boxing from the women's perspective, showing that women's boxing is truly no different than men's boxing just in gender! Hillary Swank gives an unforgettable performance, and in my eyes is a shoo in come Oscar time! A must see for boxing fans and Oscar-caliber film fans alike!",9,3,5,22 February 2005
