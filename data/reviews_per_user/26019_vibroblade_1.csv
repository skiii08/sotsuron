Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Everything and more
","With the unbelievable hype, and media circus, it's no wonder that some people are feeling let down by this movie. Their ridiculous expectations have jaded their judgment and made them cynical.I for one LOVE this movie! It is one of the, if not the, best in the series. It was everything I expected and more. It rewards repeat viewing too. After one viewing, I thought it was great, but not as good as Empire. After 2 viewings, it became my favorite. This is not an isolated occurrence either. Many have posted at others sites on the net that their opinion of TPM increased with each viewing. I think that's because they just watched the movie instead of analyzing it, after the first viewing.In short, this is a movie for the family, for the Sci-fi fan, for the action fan, AND the Star Wars fan. Go out and enjoy, and leave your ridiculous preconceptions behind. You're in for a wonderful ride with one of the finest Sci-fi movies ever made!",10,0,0,24 May 1999
