The Avengers," One of the best films I've ever seen. A MUST SEE!
","Like many people, who have been fast forwarding the credits to see the teasing snippet at the end in the Iron Man films, Thor, Captain America etc, I was ridiculously excited to see this film. I'll hold my hands up now and admit that I am a huge sci-fi nerd and regard Thor and Iron Man 1 as two of my favourite ever films (along with titles such as the recent Star Trek, or the Lord of the Rings trilogy). Needless to say, I was not disappointed. This film was, there's only one way to put this... INCREDIBLE! The special effects were out of the world, literally the best effects I have ever seen, on a larger scale than the most recent Transformers film, but less in your face and over powering. The effects were first rate, completely seamless and is definitely something to watch on the big screen, rather than wait for the DVD.I found that the acting was really good as well, everyone pulling their weight with a big nod towards Tom Hiddleston who i believe was one of the stars of the show. Definitely the best Hulk there has ever been and Chris Hemsworth was utterly fantastic. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr will deserve all the plaudits he takes from this film as he was brilliant, as always, in his role of Tony Stark. Even Scarlett Johansson, who many assumed would just be 'token bo__' was really good and her character had surprising depth.This is one of those films where you cant help but smile while watching it as you follow an incredible story line while witnessing faultless special affects. I cannot recommend this film enough, I have seen it once at the cinema and have already booked tickets to go see it again. The phrase 'a must see' has not been as relevant since Lord of the Rings, People..GO SEE THIS FILM!",10,5,11,9 May 2012
