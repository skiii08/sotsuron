Ford v Ferrari," 2019: The Year They Started Making Them Like They Used To Again
","Ford v Ferrari is of a type. A certain brand of mainstream, middle America, crowd-pleasing movie about people that audiences love and critics begrudgingly accept. Movies of this type used to come around a few times a year, and they'd end up at the top of the box office at years end. That concept is completely foreign to an industry held hostage by giant TV series, custom made for a devoted but niche group of fans. We've forgotten that big blockbuster movies can be for everyone. Because for all the gibes about it being a 'Dad Movie', Ford v Ferrari has the well-rounded, old-fashioned, slick, star-driven Hollywood entertainment that goes down smooth for anybody.It makes an almost too perfect comparison with the movie's star car, the Ford GT40. Somewhere between its impersonal factory-made cohorts and its sophisticated and refined rivals is a solid, powerhouse machine built with rugged American drive and ingenuity.From the acting, including one of Christian Bale's best ever performances and a series of surprisingly charismatic supporting work, to some of the most sensational racing scenes I've seen, Ford v Ferrari is strong filmmaking all the way through. Granted, mainstream Hollywood stuff like this inevitably smooths over a lot with cliche. We get a fair share of dopey dialogue and a particularly annoying child actor, but director James Mangold is too good to let the film succumb to its formula.This is red-blooded, American, alpha-male excitement, of the kind we've come to forget even exists anymore. It's heartfelt enough, smart enough, and fun enough to make its standard issue underdog trappings feel genuine. And just like that, a huge swath of ignored audiences across America are heard again.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," On Familiar Tides. Pirates 4 Is A Standard But Entertaining Bonus Adventure
","When Gore Verbinski wrapped up his Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy with the massive, climactic epic, At World's End, it felt like the end of an era. The history built up between the characters was brought to a head and completely resolved by the closing credits. And yet, with more money to be had, a fourth movie was commisioned. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides suffers mightily in comparison to Gore Verbinski's iconic trilogy. It is lacking in energy and style, and the new cast of characters are uninspired. Still, On Stranger Tides gets the job done competently. This is a serviceably entertaining comic adventure with some fun set-pieces and beautiful scenery. Taken on it's own merits, it works as a nice bonus adventure for the series.The story is the antithesis to At World's End's sprawling complexity. Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, The English, The Spanish, Blackbeard (Ian McShane), and his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz), are on the trail of the Fountain of Youth, all with their own motivations for getting there. The rules and regulations of the fountain's mystical powers require a good bit of side quests (finding two silver chalices, capturing a mermaid's tear, etc.), but On Stranger Tides' story is dramatically slimmed down from all three previous movies.On the one hand, I liked the decision to shed the extra narrative weight. It would have been impossible to try to top the epic richness of At World's End, so scaling down makes perfect sense. However, what On Stranger Tides loses in narrative fat, it also loses in charm, personality, and energy. Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann may have seemed like dead weight at times in the first three movies, but their exclusion here makes you appreciate what they brought to the series. They were the straight men among the colorful ensemble cast, directing the story forward and allowing Jack Sparrow and the rest to find that sweet spot on the peripheries of the story. With On Stranger Tides, most of the characters from the previous entries are gone, and the show is run by Jack Sparrow in as close to a standard 'hero' role as he's had in the series. There is no getting around it, things just feel lonely without that crew we grew to love over the trilogy. The cast around Captain Jack lacks the personality of the first three films. Everybody fulfills a standard archetype, nothing more, nothing less. Aside from Cruz's Angelica, who has a great sultry chemistry with Depp, the cast is forgettable. Even Ian McShane's Blackbeard seems like a discount Barbossa from the first movie. His ship, The Queen Anne's Revenge is a beautifully designed set, but it's big hook is that Blackbeard's magic sword can control its ropes and shoot fire from the hull. Compared to The Black Pearl and The Flying Dutchman, it's pretty lame. That feeling seems to extend to the production design and action as well. Where this series used to savor the opportunities for unique creature designs and action set-pieces, On Stranger Tides coasts along well worn territory. There's nothing wrong with zombies or carriage chases or any of the other adventure clich√©s that are trotted out in the film, but nothing is particularly inspired. The mermaids are the most unique of the new additions in the creature department, and they're well-rendered, but like the rest of On Stranger Tides' design elements, they don't add up to much. Everything looks nice individually, but I can't say I was swept up in the world the same way I was in Verbinski's Trilogy.Rob Marshall, as director, proves that not just anybody can bring to these stories the type of crowd-pleasing excitement that Gore Verbinski brought to his trilogy. The action scenes are fun, but the rhythm and cadence is somehow off. Verbinski seamlessly merged humor with action and he filmed his action scenes with a palpable sense of zest for filmmaking. Marshall's action scenes move along jauntily from beat to beat, but the humor therein lurches forward and back when it should blend with the thrills. I liked the opening chase and the first swordfight between Angelica and Jack, and the rest of the set-pieces are functional, but none of the action quite reaches Verbinski-level excitement. The climactic final fight in the Fountain of Youth in particular is deficient. Compare it to the similar finale of Curse of the Black Pearl. That scene was so full of life, with sweeping camera moves, a roaring score, and the enthusiastic vigor of the cast. It was heaven for an adventure enthusiast like myself. Tides' scene is dead in comparison. It boasts a beautiful set and good fight choreography, but that alone is not enough to bring an action scene to life. As disappointing as Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides can be, I still found myself satisfied with it as a straightforward adventure. I was particularly impressed with the tropical locations, which are often jaw-droppingly beautiful. The jungles, beaches, and caves are bright and vibrant and alluring. If you get nothing else from On Stranger Tides, at the very least, you get to see some very pretty landscapes. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a smaller, less exciting movie than the first three, and I can't believe that this relatively low energy romp was directed by the same man who gave us the vivaciously dynamic Chicago, but if you think of this movie as a sort of side quest in the Pirates series, it does the job. The simple tale of the voyage to the Fountain of Youth provides ample amounts of what makes adventure movies fun: lush scenery, polished production design, humor, and thrills. Held against Verbinski's brilliant trilogy, it doesn't hold up, but as a kind of Pirates DLC, it's comfortably satisfying. 72/100",7,0,0,4 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Beginning of the Star Wars Saga Introduces a Vivid New Universe and Celebrates the Innocent Fun of Star Wars, Despite Its Flaws
","While it received generally positive reviews upon its release, and captured the imaginations of an entire generation of younglings, The Phantom Menace has garnered an almost toxic reputation on the internet in the years since. Sure, it's not a perfectly structured film, and yes, there are more than a few dopey decisions, but the sheer spectacle and sense of fun in Star Wars: Episode I cannot be denied. George Lucas' return to a galaxy far, far away is a triumph of creative vision. A movie that overcomes any and all of its narrative deficiencies through the pure drive of its creator to wow, thrill, and inspire.The Phantom Menace is chapter one of the Star Wars Saga, and it feels very much like the beginning of a larger story. It introduces all of the important players in the saga, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, The Jedi Council, and Anakin Skywalker, the tragic hero who we know will one day become the legendary Darth Vader. On a micro level, the plot revolves around an intergalactic trade war that leads to tensions between the Trade Federation and the inhabitants of the peaceful, Garden of Eden-like planet called Naboo. Jedis Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), are sent as peacekeepers to protect the planet's leader, Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) from the evil Trade Federation and the ancient Sith Lord, Darth Maul, one of the most frightening and iconic characters ever to come out of the Star Wars universe. The Trade Federation plot does not have the same level of buoyant escapism as the originals', but it's not far off. The politics are kept at a minimum, and they only serve to create bad guys for our heroes to fight. The more important element of Episode I's story is the extended introduction of young Anakin Skywalker to this new Star Wars universe. The most interesting beats of the story center around Anakin and his mother, and The Jedi council's trepidation regarding the boy Qui-Gon suspects is the Chosen One. You get the sense that there is something special, yet sinister about the young podracing phenom from Tatooine. It's a great aspect of the film that largely goes unrecognized.None of the pieces of the plot really mean much for the prequel trilogy's overarching story of the downfall of Anakin Skywalker, but The actual conflict of Episode I is largely unimportant. At it's core, The Phantom Menace serves as a feature length introduction to George Lucas' new (old) Star Wars Universe. Episode I is the prologue to the Saga, telling a simple story that puts the pieces in place for later films while still standing on its own. On that level, it's kind of brilliant. Lucas takes a universe that was, as sweeping as it felt, still confined to a small collection of characters, and tears the lid off. The Phantom Menace does more to create a fictional history and detailed lore for the Star Wars universe than any other film. All of a sudden, this universe was no longer just a backdrop for the characters to play around in. It became a real place, with real politics, history, tradition, and age-old myths of its own. Remarkable if you ask me.Next to their storytelling, Star Wars movies have always been known for their special effects. With 16 years between movies, George Lucas' ILM team had the chance to perfect all of their award-winning visual effects, and perfect they did. Incorporating a litany of techniques from miniatures and animatronics to innovative use of CGI, The Phantom Menace is a breathtaking film to look at. Every single shot of The Phantom Menace is a work of art, and the sheer amount of imagination put into the world is worthy of praise. From the environments to the vehicles, the costumes, and the creatures, everything in this universe is unique, and ILM and company craft them with an unrivaled eye for detail. So strong is Lucas' vision of this world, that the plotting and dialogue are almost unnecessary. The visual storytelling of The Phantom Menace is that uncommonly strong.That expert craftsmanship extends to the action sequences. George Lucas' strengths as an editor and technician translate to more than a few show-stopping set-pieces. My favorite of which is young Anakin's bid for freedom, a kinetic and thrilling race across the vast deserts of Tatooine. The Podrace is a visually stunning and genuinely tense showcase of absolute speed. It still remains one of the most fun sequences in recent movie history. The same goes for the climactic three-way lightsaber duel at the end of the film. With brilliant visual effects, fast-paced and furious choreography, and a euphoric sense of scope, it brought something brand new to the Star Wars Universe, large-scale lightsaber duels. The battles, both in space and on land, stand out as old-fashioned, innocent fun. Despite a few silly moments, they tap into that Saturday matinee spectacle that resonates with the kid in us all.I love The Phantom Menace, despite its quirks. The script is clunky, especially in the first act where the plot seems to spin its wheels. There are slow moments and plenty of silly gags that fall flat. But my God, this movie is fun to watch! The visual splendor, the larger-than-life action set-pieces, the grand fun of the whole thing, The Phantom Menace is irresistible entertainment. An event movie with this kind of innocent charm is something unique in Hollywood, and that child-like earnestness is what makes this movie particularly endearing for me. The Phantom Menace might be different from the original trilogy in certain aesthetics, but importantly, not in feel. For the majority of this movie's runtime, it exudes the same brand of vibrant movie magic that made A New Hope a beloved classic. I won't call TPM a classic. I have my hangups with it, but I personally cannot bring myself to dislike this movie. Star Wars: Episode I works as an introduction to a brand new world, and as a stand-alone adventure that celebrates the innocent fun of the Original Star Wars.86/100",9,93,134,1 December 2015
The Sound of Music," A Sweeping Tale of Family, The Sound of Music is a Film to Fall in Love With.
","The Sound of Music, Bob Wise's adaptation of the Rogers and Hammerstein musical, is so beloved, and has been for so long, that it almost seems wrong to look at it with a critical eye. It's not so much a movie as it is a cultural monument. But forget the monumental money it grossed, or the Oscars it won. There's something about The Sound of Music that cuts through the critical divide. I love this movie. No, it's not that I simply think it is an exceptionally well-crafted piece of family entertainment. I do, but unlike almost any other film I've seen, The Sound of Music makes me feel something like real, genuine love. When Julie Andrews sings, my heart swoons.Based loosely on the true story of the Von Trapps, and the stage musical that came from their remarkable exploits in Austria in the late 1930s, The Sound of Music is primarily a tale of family. For those few who haven't seen it, the story centers on the Von Trapp patriarch (Christopher Plummer), and Julie Andrews' nun-turned-governess Maria, as she teaches the family music, and brings life back into the Von Trapp home. The plot takes on a richly un-purposeful quality. Maria's connection with the Von Trapp children is the main thread through the picture, and it is given ample room to breathe and grow. Intimate as it is, the film's story of the Von Trapps' gradual shift from a strict and regimented household to a place of warmth and love, actually has something of an epic reach. At 3 hours long, including intermission, The Sound of Music is set against the rise of Nazi Germany. That length and historical reach, however, is not all that makes The Sound of Music feel epic.The film benefits immensely from its locations. Salzburg is given the spotlight, and it is appropriately majestic. Framed against those famous Alps, the city is, pardon the clich√É¬©, a character unto itself. The Sound of Music does one thing that seems so simple, and yet very few movies achieve. It creates a tangible sense of place from its opulent sets and exquisitely photographed exteriors. Simply looking nice is not enough to give the audience the type of experience Bob Wise's production does. This is a patient film, one that savors its spectacular settings, immersing rather than just showing.And it is also patient with its characters, even more to its benefit. We are allowed to live with the Von Trapps, and really get to know the Von Trapp children, all well-cast and played. The familial relationships are built naturally over time. The meandering quality of the story is an asset. It's not a film where every scene counts, where every beat moves the story forward. It would be a lesser film if it was. Instead, The Sound of Music spends time with 'meaningless' scenes. A frolic in the hills, impromptu musical numbers (The Lonely Goatherd puppet show is a totally unnecessary, but absolutely delightful interlude), and outings that convey only the remarkable charm of the actors and the splendid beauty of Austria. Part of the movie's success rests on our connection to these characters. Mercifully, nothing is rushed. These people make fabulous company, and the acting only makes our hearts grow fonder.As stated before, the Von Trapp children are genuinely charming, never falling victim to the sugary artificiality that plagues many child actors. The supporting characters, including Eleanor Parker as The Baroness, strike the same note, colorful but not overbearing. Christopher Plummer is invaluable as the film's straight man. A rigid drill sergeant who gradually discovers love again, he provides the movie's most potent emotional beats. But I'm burying the lead. Julie Andrews is miraculous in the lead role. Maria is a more understated take on her Oscar-winning Mary Poppins, but Andrews is just as vivacious here. It's hard to play motherly, lovable, or fun. If you don't have a natural effervescence, the audience will reject it. Julie Andrews has it in every fiber of her being. Her performance is a tour de force. The film is about bringing life and love to a family that needs it. Andrews' performance does just that. She brings no less than life itself to the screen whenever she is on it. Along with her classically beautiful singing voice, Andrews' presence is uncommonly memorable. More so than perhaps any other movie character, I felt as if I myself had fallen in love with Maria. Julie Andrews is just that good.All this is in service to the film's outstanding soundtrack. The songs are classics, we know them all by heart, even if we haven't seen the film. In the vein of the rest of the film, the music is bubbly and lovable. For me, the standout numbers are 'Do-Re-Mi', with it's catchy lyrics and gorgeous montage of Salzburg locations, and 'I Have Confidence', a new song that showcases Julie Andrews at her most girlishly buoyant. Even the smaller songs work their magic in context. The patriotic folk song, 'Edelweiss', written by Rogers and Hammerstein specifically for the musical, is given a rousing rendition late, as is the titular song, 'The Sound of Music', in a poignant scene halfway through the film. They're not all gold, but the songs in The Sound of Music are a class above most movie musicals.The Sound of Music succeeds on terms that we don't often think to evaluate movies on. It is lovable to an extreme, not concerned with the strength of its script, but with the charm of its actors, the quality of its locations, and the sound of its music. Bob Wise's direction, as technically accomplished as it is, is not as important as the intangible spark of magic in Julie Andrews' eyes. The breathtaking cinematography is great, but what makes The Sound of Music truly special is the sense of family, and the love we have for them. It's hard to evaluate The Sound of Music critically, because its greatness extends beyond critical evaluation. I fell in love with this film, and like the real deal, I'll never be able to fully explain why.94/100",9,2,2,25 December 2018
The Longest Yard," Crude, Boorish, and 'Jock'ular. Sandler's Longest Yard is a Guy's Dream Football Comedy.
","I have no connection to the original The Longest Yard, the classic Burt Reynolds sports flick, so my review of Adam Sandler's remake comes without the full context. That being said, I find the 2005 film one of Sandler's best. A hearty mixture of prison comedy, football drama, and vice-versa, The Longest Yard is nothing if not entertaining, especially for fans of the gridiron.Adam Sandler stars as Paul Crewe, a former football star who is sent to jail for drunk driving. Once there, the corrupt Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) organizes a football game where the sadistic prison guards can take out their frustrations on the inmates. Crewe gathers an eclectic team to take on the guards, and this is where kickoff starts, so to speak. The Longest Yard boasts an all-star cast, but not in the traditional sense. Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, and Burt Reynolds are the headliners here, but the real genius of the casting in The Longest Yard is in its supporting characters. The use of other kinds of stars, namely actual athletes who play the inmates and guards is no less than inspired. A rapper, Nelly, professional wrestlers Bill Goldberg, Bob Sapp, Dalip Singh (The Great Khali), and 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin, and NFL stars Michael Irvin, Terry Crews, and Brian Bosworth, are the heart of The Longest Yard. The athletes' here have screen presence to spare, and the movie oozes with goofy machismo. Each of the supporting players, including other comedians like Nicholas Turturro and Tracy Morgan, are cleverly drawn comedic characters. Each player has his place in the story. Both teams are made of people you can remember, and root for (or against) by the time the big game rolls around.As funny as The Longest Yard is, and it is at times up-roaringly hilarious, the movie works on more than just one level. Unlike another Adam Sandler football comedy, The Waterboy, The Longest Yard has some truly sensational football sequences, as well as a dash of genuine drama in a couple later scenes. On the topic of the 'Big Game' that the movie builds to, I really can't think of a time I have been more amused by such a well-worn clich√©. These football scenes are a joy to watch, if only because the inmates vs prison guards framing device allows the filmmakers to go above and beyond what you'd see on a regular Sunday. The players hit each other absurdly hard, but there is still a layer of authenticity to the scenes, thanks to the professional athletes in front of the camera.I'm not one to turn my nose up at Adam Sandler or his popular comedies, but The Longest Yard is more wildly and consistently entertaining than just about anything he has ever done. From the start, there is a macho zest coursing through this movie's veins. It's a guys flick if ever there was one. For dudes who can handle some good-natured racial ribbing, and tackles that make your head rattle just watching them, The Longest Yard is as cathartic as a touchdown and as satisfying as a cheeseburger.75/100",7,0,2,12 November 2017
The Hangover," An Interesting Concept Is Wasted In This Ugly, Humor-Free Trash
","I understand how The Hangover became a hit with audiences. The raunchy, foul- mouthed spirit of the movie is precisely the kind of thing teenage boys try to create in the schoolyard. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis are the type of group every middle schooler wants to be a part of. They're vulgar, cool, and a little dopey. The 'jokes', if you can call them that, are dumb teenage humor incarnate. I get why The Hangover has its younger fans. What baffles me about The Hangover is that it is so celebrated by critics. This is a comedy of the worst kind. One that is less interested in wit than it is in four letter words. The concept of The Hangover is a good one, ripe with potential for lots of laughs. In it, three friends retrace their steps after a wild bachelor party in Las Vegas in order to find the missing bachelor. There's a clever idea to have the crew rediscover the pieces of their crazy night along with the audience. Unfortunately, the concept basically fizzles out after the first couple encounters.And let's talk about those encounters. The little vignettes that the crew goes through to piece their night back together are total whiffs. There is plenty of room for comedy here. What did the crew get up to last night? Your mind runs wild with possibilities. What does the movie give us? Mike Tyson, a tiger, and a baby. If you didn't laugh at that list, chances are you won't laugh at the movie because all writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore do is present these scenarios flat. We're asked to laugh simply at the fact that Mike Tyson is on the screen. 'They met Mike Tyson last night, isn't that funny?'. There is absolutely no attempt to be clever with the concept. It's all surface. Another famous gag sees Ken Jeong jumping out of a car naked. Again, if you don't laugh at the idea of a naked Asian man, then you won't laugh at the movie. Without adding any kind of situational thought, a naked man running around screaming has less comedic value than a birthday clown. Scenes like this just sit there flailing around aimlessly in hopes for any kind of laugh.And that's the target The Hangover aims for--any kind of laugh. That's why the movie is so vulgar. The director, Todd Phillips, is clearly just trying anything. It's trial and error right before your eyes. This joke didn't hit? Throw in a couple F-bombs and see if that gets anything. The movie is just so peppered with filth that it all becomes meaningless. When every other word is a swear, it just becomes noise. The trio of actors do nothing to help matters. Bradley Cooper is a fine actor, and a relatively likable persona. Here he is a disgusting, mean-spirited prick. Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis are funny, funny guys. They are squandered here. Let's face it, it's hard to be funny when you have nothing clever to say. The dialogue here is comedically bankrupt. When 'So long, gay boys' is one of your big quotes and a guy getting tazed is one of your big scenes, you've got some serious script problems. There are hundreds of comedies that fail because they're too silly or they try too hard to get laughs. Then, every once in a while comes a movie like The Hangover. A film of such laziness, such ambivalence to the idea of creating comedic scenarios, that it physically repelled me. All The Hangover does is insist you laugh at its concept, and if you like filth, laugh at that too. It's a total mess. I have no idea what people see in this movie. It's ugly, nasty, gross, and I did not laugh once. Other than that, well, it still sucks.06/100",1,3,5,27 August 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Inglourious Basterds is an Expertly Written Time Bomb. The Blast is Worth the Wait.
","The importance of a good ending cannot be overstated. Take the case of Quentin Tarantino's nazi revenge fantasy, Inglourious Basterds. The majority of the 6th film by Tarantino is talky, a bit slow, not quite as thrilling as you might expect from Quentin. But even if these early scenes, as literate, beautifully shot, and tense as many of them are, don't grab you completely, they serve as foundation to what becomes one of the most daring, insane, masterful endings of all-time.The movie is told in four chapters. Chapter One is a prologue of sorts introducing us to the two main players in the story, Hans Landa, The Jew Hunter, and Shosanna, an escaped Jewish girl who eventually inherits a Parisian cinema. It's a classic showcase for Tarantino dialogue, with two men at a table playing the most subtle of mind games with each other. It's also the first chance for Christoph Waltz to show off the joie de vivre he brings to Landa, a highly intelligent nazi hitman. Chapters Two through Four are also slow, dialogue-driven set-up pieces. The Basterds are introduced, Brad Pitt's team of Jewish soldiers, Hellbent on murdering as many Nazis as they can before the war ends. So is Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Br√ºhl), a German war hero and star of A Nation's Pride, the fictional propaganda film created for this movie. Lastly comes a British spy unit, headed by Michael Fassbender's scene-stealing Lt. Archie Hicox and German actress-turned-double-agent Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger). As the plot moves forward, we realize that each thread is leading to the same place, the Nazi premiere for A Nation's Pride.With Tarantino's dialogue propping them up, and these actors filling them with such vitality, the scenes building up to Chapter Five are never less than watchable. A Tarantino scene cannot go on too long. In this film, even the mundane things, the eating of strudels or the playing of a card game, are laced with multiple layers of tension. It's hard to explain good dialogue except to say that when it has the rhythm and colorful vocabulary of Tarantino's does, you don't want it to stop. Also watchable are the performances, with standout turns from the aforementioned Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender. Waltz is the main acting attraction, oozing a kind of satisfied mastery over the art of evil. He is stunning from the get go. But Fassbender is the overlooked gem of the bunch, in a small part that he makes brilliantly large. His dutiful British agent is a fabulous creation, smart, sophisticated, and intimidating. He bloody rocks!Then comes Chapter Five, Revenge of the Giant Face. What a ride these last twenty minutes or so are. Perceptive viewers may feel they know precisely what's going to happen come the big premiere. The revenge plot/war-ending sabotage mission is spelled out along the way, lighting the fuse for an eventual explosion. The genius of this script is that just when we are finally ready to sit back and watch the fireworks, things begin to change directions in ways we didn't see coming. Surprise after surprise left me awe-struck (One such moment happens to be one of the best laugh lines of recent memory, 'Grazie!'). It's a cascading wave of resolutions that seem to come out of nowhere, yet we realize were totally inevitable. Of course there is also delirious, shocking violence, and some terrifying, iconic, monumental imagery. These images sear themselves into your memory for weeks. The whole film is exquisitely photographed by Robert Richardson, but the ending rises to another level entirely. For a film to coast along for two hours as a buttoned-up suspense yarn, only to evolve rapidly into a work of insane madness, it had to have been made by a filmmaker as creatively liberated as Quentin Tarantino. So many directors, even the great ones, work off existing templates. They accomplish certain goals with skill. Tarantino makes his own goals and his own methods of reaching them.Like a great magic act, Inglourious Basterds lulls us into trusting our own intuition, before revealing something utterly unexpected. If you were to only watch through Chapter Four, Basterds would seem like a disparate collection of stories loosely tied together with thematic similarities. The movie would be a suitably tense, very well-constructed, middle-of-the-road war picture. It's that balls-to-the-wall madness of Chapter Five that retroactively infuses the rest of the film with significance. After being blown away by a swift burst of provocative violence, all of a sudden, Inglourious Basterds is a whole lot more interesting.94/100",9,0,3,26 November 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One: A Worthless Story
","As is customary when reviewing a Star Wars movie, I am obligated to begin by explaining my own connection to the franchise. I love Star Wars, but I am of the opinion that George Lucas' six-part saga is the only story worth mentioning in the cinematic history of the franchise. I find the post-Lucas sequels to be a disgusting affront to what is left of artistic originality and creativity in Hollywood. A hostile corporate takeover of what was essentially a uniquely auteur piece of pop art. I am against Disney/Lucasfilm's fan fiction on principle, but that doesn't mean I can't still enjoy it for what it is; Disposable science fiction action with a Star Wars branded coat of paint. That is especially the case with Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Unlike its big Disney brothers, Rogue One doesn't try to pretend to be part of the same ongoing saga. Instead, it does what I might've hoped Disney's fan fiction would; fill in the gaps with a unique, smaller scale trifle whose purpose is only to entertain. Still, even with tempered expectations, I got little out of Rogue One. The sad fact is, this is a bad movie, littered with terrible decision after terrible decision, leading to a trite waste of the Star Wars name.Rogue One is a different kind of 'Star Wars Story'. As a tangential 'one-off' story about a group of Rebels only mentioned in A New Hope and their mission to capture the plans to the original Death Star, Rogue One is not aiming to be a new chapter in the saga. It is more like an attempt to recreate Marvel's reliable pattern of standalone films that bolster the 'main storyline'. And like those films, it feels unashamedly manufactured. There is a lot of heavy speeches and overblown melodrama, but really, this movie is only superficially 'big'. The story is small-scale all the way through; A tension-free, low-stakes, TV-style lark for action buffs. And all of this is despite the fact that director Gareth Edwards pulls out all the visual stops to make Rogue One feel like a war epic.I understand that Rogue One wants to be a war epic, but the visual style of the film, for the most part, is a major disadvantage. Edwards does scale well, and the extended, multi-layered battle that takes up the film's last half hour is pretty spectacular. It's everything else that took me out of the experience. Edwards and DP Greig Fraser are obsessed with close-up, out of focus, handheld camera work, and the film's color palette is disgustingly drab. With the exception of that final battle (which takes place on a beautiful tropical military base), Rogue One is awful to look at; closer to a moody TV ad than an epic war movie. The visual style is a major miscalculation, but it is one of many.Most notably misjudged are the characters. From the writing to the casting to the acting, this thing is a disaster when it comes to portraying people we are supposed to care about. Felicity Jones plays the protagonist, Jyn Erso, an insipid take on the lazy 'orphan-turned-leader' formula that gave us Rey. She meets, among others, Forest Whitaker, Diego Luna, and Riz Ahmed. I don't find any of these actors particularly appealing regardless, but all of them give bad performances here. Whitaker makes some truly bizarre decisions as a Rebel extremist, and Jones is even worse. Her face lacks anything but a blank, detached, dopiness, and when she is forced to give grandiose rallying cries, it's impossible to not roll your eyes. The only one in the whole cast that comes out relatively unscathed is Donnie Yen as a blind wannabe Jedi with a pointy stick.There is not much keeping Rogue One from being a mildly enjoyable sci-fi action flick. The story, as trivial as it is, is enough to hang some battles on and call it a day. This film should have been, at least, exciting. The final battle is, but the journey there is filled with far too many ridiculous errors in judgement. For all the production designs and cutting-edge CGI, Rogue One can't keep from shooting itself in the foot. The characters stink. The cinematography stinks. The dialogue stinks. If these aspects were merely tolerable, the action (directed quite well by Edwards) might have been fun. But there is so much that is not tolerable, so many distractingly bad elements, that it is hard to lose yourself in the battles. Even when Darth Vader shows up at the end, I could only get partially giddy. If you must exploit the Star Wars name, it has to be more worthwhile than this.35/100",3,1,8,8 January 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," For Rip-Roaring Summer Adventure, It Doesn't Get Better Than Dead Man's Chest
","When the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Curse of the Black Pearl, became a cinematic sensation overnight in 2003, a sequel was all but assured. Thankfully, Dead Man's Chest builds on its predecessor, rather than coasting off its success. With Gore Verbinski back in the director's chair and salivating at the chance to up the ante on the first film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is simply electrifying. Thrilling, humorous, and straight up fun, Dead Man's Chest is a skillfully crafted summer blockbuster with more exuberant joy per square minute than just about everything else hitting cinemas today.Dead Man's Chest amps up the stakes dramatically from Curse of the Black Pearl. Where that film was a straightforward adventure in the vein of the classic pirate movies of the 1930s through the 50s, the sequel is darker and more dramatic, while still retaining the wholesome charm of the first film. Captain Jack Sparrow, once again played with enthusiastic charm by Johnny Depp, is the focal point of the plot this time around. A prior deal with this film's villain, the grotesque fish creature named Davy Jones (motion captured by Bill Nighy), leaves Jack Sparrow on the run as Jones and the cursed crew of his ship, The Flying Dutchman, lead a relentless pursuit. This short summary fails to capture the complexity of the story of Dead Man's Chest. There is a lot to keep track of here. The rules for the various ancient curses and spells are given an exorbitant amount of screen time and the peripheral characters each have their own side stories which converge around this film's MacGuffin, a chest containing the still-beating heart of Davy Jones. Would it be a better film if the story shed some of the superfluous side stories and charted a simpler path? I'm not sure that's the case. The story of Dead Man's Chest is very involved with many moving parts, but it is not particularly difficult to follow. Basically, Pirates 2 simply raises the stakes from the first movie. It's a grander adventure. A pirate saga where characters like Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann get some appreciated character development. Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly both give an earnest sweetness to roles that may have otherwise rang hollow. The story is also a good deal grimmer than the first movie. Most of that darkness comes from Nighy's Davy Jones. Jones and his crew are the standouts of the movie. The Flying Dutchman's half man, half fish creatures (envisioned by master designer Crash McCreery) are wonders of imagination in the way they combine man and sea in constantly inventive ways. Jones himself is one of the great special effects creations ever. The iconic coiling tentacles that make up Jones' beard are completely photo-realistic, even in extreme close-up. You never believe what you are looking at is an effect. Jones is as real a CGI creature as I've ever seen. It's in his eyes though that ILM's work really shines. Nighy's spirit is all there and his unpredictable motion capture performance gives Davy Jones tremendous menace whenever he's on the screen. If Johnny Depp's breakout performance as Captain Jack stole the show in the first Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest belongs to Gore Verbinski. Verbinski is clearly having a blast with this script (written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio), and his passion is there from the opening frame. There is a youthful vigor and enthusiasm for filmmaking all throughout this film's two and a half hour run time. Verbinski has an eye for adventure, and his complete command over tone is unmatched. When Dead Man's Chest commits to scenes of classic swashbuckling excitement, this thing sings. The locations are so lush and vibrant, the characters are so charming, and the action scenes are so fervently inventive, that Dead Man's Chest completely overcomes any narrative bloat it might have. This movie is a feast of pure adventure spectacle. The big action set-pieces, the most exciting of which are an elaborate three-way sword-fight through the jungle on a giant wooden wheel and an epic attack by the mythical Kraken, are showcases for Verbinski's talent at giving his action scenes personality and life. Here is a director who just knows how to mix thrills and humor into a perfect entertainment gumbo. The balance is effortless. For their part, the cast does phenomenal work keeping up with Verbinski's manic energy as well. There is something to be said about how lively an action scene can be when you can see the actors savoring everything about the scenes they are in.And it's not just the action scenes that spring to life on the screen. The entire movie is supercharged with crowd-pleasing energy. This is one big, lovable film. Even with a story that sometimes feels arbitrarily drawn out, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a soaring success because of director Gore Verbinski's zest for big budget summer popcorn filmmaking. From Verbinksi to every member of the enormous cast, everybody involved with this film seems to be fully committed to the spirit of fun that made Pirates of the Caribbean one of the most deservedly popular movie franchises ever. Dead Man's Chest is a top tier summer blockbuster, with a visionary director working the audience like a fiddle. In Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Gore Verbinski takes us on an unforgettable ride. In a theater with a big crowd, it's as good a time as you will ever have at the movies.93/100",9,0,0,3 June 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Johnny Depp's Unforgettable Performance Helps Make This Swashbuckling Adventure A Modern Classic
","Today, few people can remember going into the local multiplex on a warm summer afternoon and being treated to something completely original. In the 1970s and 80s, pioneers like Spielberg and Lucas were creating modern myths, putting stories and images on screen that would be seared into the collective consciousness forever. Jaws, Star Wars, E.T, Indiana Jones, and even Jurassic Park, were more than just quality entertainment. There was a magic to those films that I thought had gone extinct by the time the 21st century rolled around. Then, in the summer of 2003, came Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. Yes, it is inspired by the theme park attraction at Disneyland, but what director Gore Verbinski and his collaborators do, is use the spirit of the ride to create something truly special. With an ensemble cast featuring big stars, veteran character actors, and young up-and-comers, lavish production design, an iconic score, and a heaping spoonful of humor, Pirates of the Caribbean represents the perfect storm of summer entertainment. The Curse of the Black Pearl does not simply coast on a recognizable name. Instead, Verbinski and company dare to create something brand new. In the end, thanks in large part to Johnny Depp's audacious lead performance, Pirates of the Caribbean brings magic back to the movies.The titular curse of the Black Pearl is the driving force behind the story of Pirates of the Caribbean. The Black Pearl's ruthless captain, Barbossa, played with scenery chewing gusto by Geoffrey Rush, and his crew are cursed by mythical Aztec Gold to live forever as the undead (In a bit of design brilliance, they're skeletal bodies can only be seen by the light of the moon). After Barbossa kidnaps the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan, played by the young beauty Keira Knightly, in order to break the curse, a young admirer of Elizabeth, a blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), enlists the help of legendary pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp in one of the most iconic performances of the decade, to help free her from the clutches of the undead crew. Now is as good a time as any to mention Johnny Depp. What he does with Jack Sparrow, with the makeup, the costume, and the unsteady, drunken, charismatic persona, is a tour de force of acting. Depp creates a pirate rockstar icon where just about everybody else would have phoned in a typical smiling Errol Flynn impression. He is simply electrifying on screen. The story of Pirates of the Caribbean is appropriately old-fashioned. Writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio take care to include just about every pirate trope there is into the script. Sword fights, romance, sea-faring battles, and buried treasure, every classic pirate situation is here. While it might have been clich√©d in less capable hands, the story here is deliciously simple. While there is a good deal of background to what the curse is and how it can be cured, the basic structure of Curse of the Black Pearl is in the spirit of the grand pirate adventures of the Golden Age of Hollywood. It is a classic adventure yarn with good guys, bad guys, sweeping romance, and high spirited adventure.Depp gets the lion's share of the credit for the success of Pirates of the Caribbean, and he does steal the show, but Gore Verbinski's direction is nearly equal to the Johnny Depp show. The pairing of the high-energy director and the classic swashbuckling material proved to be a stroke of genius on the part of Jerry Bruckheimer. Verbinski brings enough personality and humor for a dozen movies. From a purely visual standpoint, Pirates of the Caribbean is equally unique. The exotic locations, from the Bay of Port Royal to the picturesque beauty of Rumrunner's Isle, are bright, colorful, and lush. Where the production value really excels though is in how the real-life locations sync perfectly with the sets, which tastefully evoke the Disneyland attraction. In it's production design, Curse of the Black Pearl is as satisfying a visual experience as you can have in a summer blockbuster. The locations, the sets, and the dependably boundary-pushing special effects from ILM make the most of all the natural beauty of the real life Caribbean, as well as the nostalgic Disney glow of the theme park ride. In my eyes, Gore Verbinski is currently one of the best action directors working, but back in 2003, his brand of swashbuckling adventure was eye-opening. It's not just that Verbinski is so adept at giving the stunts, the highlights of which are a massive battle on the high seas and a climatic sword fight in a treasure-filled cave, an enthusiastic electricity. It's that the humor mixed throughout the action is so darn effortless. The action scenes in Pirates of the Caribbean are so fun by themselves, it seems the actors can't help but have fun along with them. The mix of humor and action in Pirates of the Caribbean is simply unrivaled. Nobody buckles swash quite as entertainingly as Gore Verbinski, and Curse of the Black Pearl represents him at the very top of his game.This movie is fun. Not just the type of fun where you walk out of the theater feeling placated, but the type of experience that leaves you with a big dumb grin on your face the entire time. Without Gore Verbinski or Johnny Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl would probably be a solid adventure. It's with these two, plus the rest of the eclectic cast, that Pirates of the Caribbean becomes a bona-fide classic. Depp's Jack Sparrow is an unforgettable character, an instant icon that came out of nowhere. Nobody could have predicted what Depp brought to the character, and yet he fits into Verbinski's world like a glove. These elements are what make Pirates of the Caribbean special. Summer blockbusters come and go, but Bruckheimer, Verbinski, and Depp did something I thought could never be done again, they captured that old movie magic, like a ship in a bottle.94/100",9,0,1,1 June 2017
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Good Sword and Sandals Adventure, but Fans of the Games will be Disappointed
","Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time is supposed to be based on the video games of the early 2000s, and it does have some of the elements from the games: parkour, time-shifting elements, etc., but the film version of the PS2 classic is closer to an average sword and sandal adventure than the magical, sprawling world of the video game.Prince of Persia tells the story of Prince Dastan, an Aladdin-type orphan thief turned Arabian hero, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, as he attempts to stop the evil vizier, played by Ben Kingsley, from destroying the world and capture the affection of Gemma Arterton's beautiful princess Tamina. There is more to the story, but it all amounts to the basic 'stop the bad guy, get the girl' story. That's not always a bad thing though, and Prince of Persia does add some clever time reversing tricks to the plot thanks to a mystical dagger that runs on the sands of time. However, with the exception of a back story regarding a ostrich farmer played by the always wonderful Alfred Molina, Prince of Persia's story is fairly strait forward.Still, this outline could've made a truly great film, but Prince of Persia: Sands of Time fumbles some key elements. For one, the set design and the locations don't have the same type of flair as the game at all. Where the film could've taken us to enchanted gardens and vast temples, it sticks close to the typical cityscapes and mountain ranges. While some of the sets and locations in the film are impressive, it seems like a big missed opportunity to create a truly unique Arabian world. The other thing holding Prince of Persia back from reaching the heights of its video game inspiration is the action. The Prince of Persia series of games is built on parkour and sword combat. The movie has a fair amount of parkour and of course there is some fighting, but it all seems small-scale. The parkour is simple and practical instead of daring and dramatic like it is in the games. The same goes for the fighting. In the games it is epic, in the film it's kind of boring.Don't get me wrong, Prince of Persia is a fun movie. The action is fast yet cohesive, the sets and costume give off a nice Arabian flair, and Alfred Molina breaks up the stiffness of the main characters nicely. It's simple, mindless Jerry Bruckheimer produced fun, but considering its source material, it could've been great. For fans of classic sword and sandal adventures it is well worth a watch, but fans of the game might be disappointed.67/100",6,14,23,15 September 2015
Ted," Seth McFarlane's Gift For Zany Humor Is Nowhere To Be Found In This Comedic Calamity
","Ted is director Seth McFarlane's first feature film. Now, I think McFarlane is a funny guy. His massively popular TV show, Family Guy, was at one time the single funniest show on television. I am a true fan of McFarlane's brand of irreverent humor, but somehow, his first film is almost 100% devoid of laughs. Ted is about a lazy stoner, played by Mark Wahlberg, and his talking, sentient, teddy bear, voiced by McFarlane in his Peter Griffin accent. The majority of the movie sees the two of them engaging in all sorts of devious behavior. They smoke pot, they pick up hookers, and they party hard. That description seems to warrant, at the very least, a handful of good laughs; especially with McFarlane running the show. However, McFarlane completely botches the humor in this movie. For example, an early gag shows the two friends using a bong. You would assume that's just the setup to the joke... nope... that IS the joke. 'They smoke pot. Isn't that funny?!'. There are so many of these instances where we're asked to laugh at the premise alone. The idea of a vulgar teddy bear is only so funny, and to hang the entire movie on that premise alone is foolish. I don't think a foul-mouthed teddy bear is funny. If you don't either, then Ted offers nothing to you.When the jokes don't simply fail, they fall into the raunchy, shock humor trap. Ted himself is incredibly crude, and yet, his vulgarity is not complemented by any type of actual comedy. He's raunchy for the sake of raunchiness. A popular segment, The 'Thunderbuddies Song' is not clever or funny in any way. It just has a ton of indecent language, so people will laugh at it, right? Judging by its popularity, I guess that's the case, but come on! Are people that easily tickled? Maybe I'm just a square, but I need more than swear words to make me laugh, I need wit. All of these comedic failures would sink this movie on their own., but the movie has another glaring issue.The second half or so of Ted is when McFarlane just gives up on the idea of making a comedy. The story of a crazed fanatic who attempts to steal Ted takes center stage and the movie becomes a straightforward chase picture. The jokes stop falling flat, but only because they stop showing up at all. The conflict itself is not at all interesting, and it is totally pointless. I don't go to comedies for action or drama, I go to laugh. On that front, Ted is a failure.I had one or two laughs during Ted. I can do better than that with any single episode of Family Guy, and I'd save myself a precious hour of life. Ted is unfunny throughout, and the second half is totally misguided. The movie is a nasty, extremely unpleasant misfire. I like Seth McFarlane, but I hate Ted.16/100",2,14,24,31 August 2015
The Irishman," The Resurrection of Classic Cinema.
","In the year 2000, Martin Scorsese appeared alongside Roger Ebert to discuss his picks for the top ten best movies of the 1990s. At number four, Scorsese chose Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, Eyes Wide Shut. He said of it, 'I cherish the film because it puts you in the authoritative hands of an old master, with a style that flies in the face of every modern convention.' Those words hold truth. It seems the very best movies are the auteur pictures. The ones with a guiding hand that shakes you in your seat, directs you through the story, and pummels you with images of power and grace. And that is how I would describe Scorsese's own film, 2019's The Irishman. This sprawling mob epic/ intimate character examination/ eulogy to a lost film era, is a gift. Through all three and a half hours of The Irishman, I was awash in a kind of deep gratitude. I had the surreal sensation of witnessing an all-time classic reveal itself before my eyes. It was like discovering The Godfather in 1972 or Goodfellas in 1990. I felt the warm truth the actors brought, and the ultra-confident hands of a filmmaker who may one day be recognized as the greatest artist of the medium. The Irishman is Scorsese's Eyes Wide Shut; a master director 's masterpiece, a towering beacon from another era, somehow, gloriously existing in this one.The most apt descriptor of the Irishman may not be the first thing to come to mind when you look at the pieces involved. For all its small time thugs, cozy interiors, and countless scenes of meetings, phone conversations and casual dinners, The Irishman is an epic. Epics seem to come to Hollywood in waves. For every boom time (1920s, 1960s, 2000s), there are long droughts where nary a single movie is made that can rightfully claim the title. We are in the middle of such a drought. Many movies are overblown and overlong, but none truly epic. The Irishman, which has gotten plenty of ire for its daunting three and half hour runtime, is one of the only true epics if its decade. And not just because of its length. The story of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a supposed mob hitman and crucial cog in the rise and fall of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) seems very much of a piece with Scorsese's other, smaller mob movies, Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed. Those films teem with energy, but they don't match The Irishman for scope. Here is an adapted screenplay by Steve Zaillian that traces the breadth of the Golden years of American crime and filters it through the eyes of a handful of characters. Following Frank from the end of World War II to the beginning of the 21st century, Zaillian and Scorsese create a story that feels enormous. The script somehow manages to weave together a slew of major world events into Frank's story a la Forrest Gump, but in a way that feels real and inevitable. This movie is huge. Scorsese holds nothing back; no idea, no bit of color, no set piece or character moment. It's all in there. Yes, The Irishman is very long, and it feels long. It should. This is a journey. The film sweeps you along for its entirety. The sumptuous technical craft and storytelling involvement make it next to impossible to tear yourself away from its embrace. You savor every single moment of The Irishman. It's a feast. The canvas is enormous and every inch of it is painted with exquisite detail.The Irishman is cast like a film lover's ultimate fantasy. The epic crime drama is populated with many of the finest character actors working, as well as a few inspired outsiders, and it stars three of the all-time titans of the industry. But fantasy this is not. What's better is not just that this film exists, for real, in our time, but that everyone is at the very top of their games. Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran roars back into the world of acting after a long hiatus as a human cartoon character. His Sheeran is an extremely tricky challenge for an actor. He is asked to play a man who is a bit of a dolt, but is still racked with unrecognized guilt. It's an internalized performance if ever there was one. DeNiro plays it absolutely right. He doesn't command the screen like we know he can, but instead wisely chooses a weak, almost bashful, but kind of charming na√É¬Øvet√É¬©. The heavy lifting comes from the supporting players. Specifically, the two other legends brought back from the cinematic grave, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. Pacino plays Jimmy Hoffa in a towering performance worthy to stand alongside the very best of his legendary career. His entrance in the film brings a thunderbolt of classic acting energy. If any living actor understands the power of commanding theatricality on screen, it must be Pacino. His Hoffa is a shining example of the tremendous power of acting joie de vivre. The beating heart of The Irishman is, however, Joe Pesci. His very appearance is a shock, having been retired from acting for 20 years, but almost more shocking is his unprecedentedly subtle brilliance as Frank Sheehan's mob mentor, Russell Bufalino. He is far away from the volatile goons on which he made his name. Here Pesci is relaxed, sagely, and world weary. His presence onscreen is awesome in an almost religious sense. It's literally like watching someone rise from the dead, wiser and more ethereal than before.Who knew this was possible? Who knew these legends who seemed to have faded away into history long ago, still had this intensity, this sensitivity, this skill? Maybe they never lost it. How lucky are we, then, to have gotten this showcase script for them to shine in? The Irishman's detractors have hid behind certain 'controversial' elements, such as the CGI de-aging used to assist the actors in portraying their younger selves, the film's length, or its distribution on Netflix. None of these trivial hang ups negate what Martin Scorsese and his collaborators have done with The Irishman. This is a classic that will hang in the annals of film history. A film to stand alongside The Godfather, Goodfellas, and the other greats of the genre. The simple fact that it exists brings me immense joy. The fact that it is a perfectly crafted piece of art, overflowing with meaning and themes and personal connections to its auteur brings me something else entirely. This is why I watch movies, why I never allow myself to get too discouraged by modern sensibilities. Because the masters are always a spark of inspiration away from returning to glory. Don't lose hope, there is still room for new classics.98/100",10,6,9,4 April 2020
L.A. Confidential," Hollywood Noir At Its Seedy, Stylish Best
","Film noir. It's like my own cinematic femme fatale. Attractive in its look, with shadows and neon and pinstriped suits, and often complicated underneath, the genre of detective stories and crime thrillers is seductive to this film connoisseur. I approach every film noir with anticipation. And yet, just like the dames who lure in an unsuspecting private eye, these films often leave me burned. Burned by mysteries whose hooks never catch or whose resolutions leave me baffled. And I still come back. Why? Because of films like L.A. Confidential. Curtis Hanson's adaptation of James Ellroy's novel represents the peak of what the genre can do. It outclasses Chinatown, overshadows Double Indemnity, upstages The Maltese Falcon. If those great films are the seduction, L.A. Confidential is the orgasm. This is the very best film noir.Three characters drive the mystery at the heart of L.A. Confidential. Police detectives Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) the by-the-book rookie, Bud White (Russell Crowe) the bruiser, and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) the crooked veteran, lead an investigation into The Nite Owl Murders, each tackling the case in their own way, and each forming a tenuous connection with a mysterious woman named Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger). Here is where most film noirs stop; with a case for the protagonist to solve, and characters who will reveal their secrets along the way. But L.A. Confidential is not so simple. It doesn't unfold as an episodic progression of events, but rather as a growing and building, tapestry of mystery. The secondary characters involved do not enter the plot in tidy, regularly-scheduled interludes, but in ever-shifting, fluid ways.Describing the plot any further would detract from the surprise of watching this mystery unfold. The Academy-Award-winning script by Hanson and Brian Helgeland finds a way to not only streamline Ellroy's sprawling novel, but dramatically enhance its underlying themes. We are kept abreast of all the plot's developments, never getting lost in the shuffle of characters, dealings, and unsaid secrets. And because the hook catches so easily, the film's carefully timed surprises work completely. What we are dealing with here is a case-study in mystery writing. More than almost any other crime thriller I've seen, L.A. Confidential invites audience investment, leading us along, convincing us we've got an idea of where it's headed before revealing a card that was there the whole time. I was riveted by this story, active in trying to figure out where the mystery was headed and thunderstruck by a shocking third act denouement.I was also, crucially, invested in these characters. Credit goes to the cast. Pearce is a natural rooting interest at the film's core, and Crowe and Spacey bring nuance to their broadly drawn characters. Elsewhere a veritable Hall of Fame lineup of character actors bring Hanson's vision of 1950s L.A. into razor-sharp focus. James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, and David Strathairn lend juicy, colorful support to the film. These are three of the best to ever do it, all working at their creative maximum. Kim Basinger is the one to come out with a gold statue for her work, and she is great as the damaged object of our cops' affection, but everyone here is Oscar-worthy, straight down the line. One of the great ensemble performances I've ever seen.And then there's Curtis Hanson, and the 50s Hollywood underground he and his collaborators resurrect in fabulous detail. L.A. Confidential is a lush period production featuring authentic costumes and sets, photographed with assured style by Dante Spinotti, lending the sleazy underbelly of Hollywood an alluring technicolor shine. Hanson's direction is ultra-confident as well. It's enough to keep the audience firmly on the story's track until the last shot, but for a movie with an arsenal of guns, shootouts, and the like, it's quite an achievement that Hanson makes us fear for every bullet. Hanson doesn't do movie violence. He does violence that is real and scary. When the guns go off, you can feel your heart in your throat. It's powerful. Real excitement. Topping it all is a brilliant, pounding jazzy score by Jerry Goldsmith, yet another reliable professional contributing their best work.The best films have a way of activating our mind, of forcing us to sit up and pay attention, and of rewarding us in turn. The act of watching L.A. Confidential is not a passive admiration of craft, as so many film noirs are. It's an active process, tempting us to try connecting the dots ourselves. You watch it with your eyes wide open, searching the screen, observing faces, trying to find cover in a gunfight. It's so much more exhilarating, so much more satisfying than any other film noir I've seen. It's grand where everything else seems small, it's fast where others are slow. It's glorious to look at and even better to think about.98/100",10,1,1,17 September 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Excessive to An Extreme, At World's End Is A Grand Pirate Epic Marred By Some Serious Narrative Glut
","The third and final installment of Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy, At World's End is a massive sea-faring spectacle. If Dead Man's Chest started the franchise on a slightly darker path, At World's End leaves no doubt that this is a completely different animal than the first Pirates adventure. Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a sweeping finale stuffed to bursting with superfluous characters and dozens of interweaving subplots, but it is also packed with energy and humor. Gore Verbinski's massive send off to the trilogy is overblown for sure, but it is satisfying enough in the big categories (action, characters, humor, visuals) to make it a worthy climax to the series.The story of At World's End revolves around no less than the Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and the East India Trading Company's plan to eradicate all pirates from the face of the earth with the help of Davy Jones and the crew of the Flying Dutchman. The scope of the story is massive. Unlike the first two movies, Pirates 3 is better described as a war movie than a pirate adventure. Alliances between the East India Trading Company and the Pirate Brethren are in a constant state of flux during this two hour forty-five minute behemoth of a movie. Along the way, Jack Sparrow must be rescued from Davy Jones' Locker, the pirates must unite against the encroaching modern world, and all the characters have to find resolution in their arcs. The story is incredibly ambitious, but its density is so overbearing for the most part that that ambition too often goes misplaced. The primary character stuff is not bad. The problems with the story stem from the fact that there is simply too much exposition, too many MacGuffins, and too much screen time given to needless subplots for the story to really shine. It's not that the script is lazy, it's not. Writers Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot put effort into connecting the dozens of side stories in a natural way. If you do your research and take notes, you can follow the plot, but at some point, the shifting alliances and expositionary curses become overkill. There's a great story in here about the celebration of old-fashioned romance in the face of a cynical modern world, but the extra baggage weighs these themes down dramatically.Still, with Verbinski and company back, the film once again drips with invigorating zeal. The cast continues to buy into the spirit of the franchise. They're all having fun, and Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly, and even Bill Nighy get to do some real acting in their respective love stories. There are no revolutionary performances here, but the sum of all the parts of the cast makes for an earnest likability to the movie as a whole. By this film, Depp's Captain Jack loses a lot of the unpredictable charisma that he brought to the role in the first two movies. His role is mainly comedic in At World's End, that by itself does not make Depp's performance any worse. Depp is a great comedic presence. He's genuinely funny, and if he doesn't get as much of the serious moments as he might have, it really didn't bother me.At the risk of sounding redundant, the look of this trilogy capper is yet again captivating in its overflow of imagination. Most of the creature designs are carried over from Dead Man's Chest, but the new additions here, including the steamy Singapore sets and Chinese junks, are rich in detail and personality. John Knoll and his team at ILM continue to dazzle with their special effects as well. The action scenes are imagined at a scale so much greater than the swashbuckling swordfights and battles from Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Man's Chest, and ILM does a superb job bringing them to life. The final conflict, a gigantic battle between the entire cast of characters procured throughout the trilogy in the middle of a biblical whirlpool in the pounding rain, is the perfect stage for the climax of the trilogy. It is a rousing action scene because of Verbinski's complete control over its complexity. Every character has a role in the battle, and there are even character resolutions that happen as the action is happening! Even with an ungainly amount of stuff going on in the scene, Verbinski gives it a fantastic orientation. You can tell what's going on and you can actually follow the battle. The scene is transporting. It puts you there, in the rain, with the characters. By the time it's over, you feel like you need some dry clothes and a nap. Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a balls-to-the-wall extravaganza. The Verbinski Trilogy gets bigger with every installment and At World's End represents the series' absolute zenith of 'bigness'. That is both harmful and helpful to the movie as a whole. The story is completely over-inflated with exposition that drags on forever and an unnecessarily shaky set of alliances (would it be so bad to know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are from the start?). There are flaws in this movie that would doom a hundred similar films. It's Gore Verbinski's direction and his relentless aura of fun that keeps this ship afloat. At World's End has gotten better with subsequent viewing for me. I'd wager it's because every time I see the film, more of the story comes into focus. The first time I saw this movie I was completely lost and unable to connect to the film's big moments. By now, those moments hit harder than ever. Who knows, in a few years I may be singing this movie's praises even more.77/100",8,0,0,3 June 2017
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man Unhinged. Raimi's Trilogy Capper is a Big, Trashy, Deliriously Entertaining Superhero Soap Opera
","I've realized over the years that I have not been watching the much-maligned Spider- Man 3 the right way. The first time I saw Spider-Man 3, I came in with expectations that Sam Raimi could somehow pull off the impossible, and hit three straight home runs. Needless to say, Spider-Man 3 did not live up to the insurmountable standard set by the first two films. The precarious balance of tone in Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 had slid too far into the comedic, the effects had leaned too far into the digital, and the story had lost focus. I didn't like Spider-Man 3 the first time I saw it. Watching it now, my feelings have changed. Maybe it's the dreary-as-a-cubicle Amazing Spider-Man movies that have made me appreciate Raimi's gonzo energy, or maybe I've just come to terms with the fact that Spider-Man 3 is not the comprehensively perfect comic book adaptation its predecessors were. Either way, I can now enjoy Spider-Man 3 for the big, trashy mess it is.You've heard the big complaint before, 'Too many villains'. It's almost become synonymous with Spider-Man 3. Any time a movie tries to cram more villains than needed into its story, it pulls a 'Spider-Man 3'. It's the rallying cry for Spider-Man 3 haters, but you know what? It doesn't bother me. Sure, Harry's 'New Goblin' is an uninspired design, but his character arc demanded he take his revenge on his friend. Sure, the controversial Sandman retcon partially negates the impact of Spidey's origin, but his presence teaches Peter forgiveness. Sure, Venom is shoehorned in, but his story is directly tied to the symbiote suit and Peter's out of control ego at the heart of the film. To not have any of the three villains in the movie would have felt like a cheat. And individually, the villains work. James Franco does what he can with his role, even if his Harry Osborne is infinitely more interesting than his Goblin. The Sandman is an inventive digital creation and Thomas Haden Church gives a solid performance as Flint Marko. And yes, I like Venom. It was, and still is jarring to see Topher Grace's dorky face emerge from the snarling monster, but his Eddie Brock is a good character, developed over the entirety of the film. His transformation into Venom doesn't come out of nowhere. So what are my problems with the film? Well, generally it comes down to the details. There are a lot of little contrivances and coincidences in Spider-Man 3, and a few big ones. Some, like Harry's amnesia or Bernard the Butler's late-game bombshell, I can take in stride. It's part of the heightened soap opera drama of the best Spider-Man stories. Others, like Sandman's phantom reason for wanting to kill Spider-Man, or the corny news broadcast as a framing device for the final fight, are harder to swallow. Spider-Man 3 is a movie in desperate need of another run through the typewriter. The whole thing feels rushed. Raimi was infamously saddled with studio interference and a firm release date deadline, so it doesn't surprise me that the script is so sloppy, but if you ask me, the best way to handle a sloppy script is to double down on the entertainment value. The biggest sin Sam Raimi could have committed was to make a boring movie out of this material. Spider-Man 3 is anything but boring. This movie is pure entertainment on every level. The action scenes are clearly the best reason to see Spider-Man 3. Down the line, they pack that signature, high-flying, kinetic, Raimian dynamism that makes his scenes punch harder than most anybody else's. The special effects, on the other hand, are all over the place. There are times when Spider-Man is swinging through the New York skyline, and it hits like an air-born ballet. Then there are shots where the CGI looks shockingly, inexcusably rubbery and fake. Even so, accounting for the inconsistent digital effects and accounting for the fact that we've seen the same type of stuff twice already, there wasn't a moment when Spider-Man was on screen and my eyes didn't light up. The action is sumptuous to behold. The visuals, sound effects and direction of Spider-Man 3's action scenes are world class, and let's be honest, it's hard to complain about anything in a blockbuster that can deliver not one, not two, but at least three showstopping action set-pieces. Between the action, things are almost as lively. Raimi is not interested in subtlety when it comes to the story's dramatic moments. Make no mistake, this is a soap opera. Relationships flip and flop, characters scheme and fight, and plot details turn so dramatically you can almost detect a faint 'Dun, Dun, Duuuun!' on the soundtrack. The whole thing is so outrageous, that while yes, it is hard to take seriously, its rather easy to enjoy. Even those jazz scenes everyone complains about. They're funny. Whether the humor is intentional or not is irrelevant. Tobey Maguire going full tilt emo and dancing to old school jazz music is fun to watch, context be damned.There are two ways to watch Spider-Man 3. You can watch it in comparison to the soul-affirming classiness of the original two movies, and lament the fact that the franchise has fallen victim to the 'Bigger, better' curse that hits all franchises at some point. Or, you can give into the zaniness of the whole thing. This isn't a prestige picture. It's drive-in pulp. And it's some of the most action-packed, flat out spectacularly entertaining drive-in pulp you'll ever see. It might take a few viewings, but if you can get yourself to surrender to Spider-Man 3's giddy charm, it's well worth it. When it comes to summer blockbusters, give me too much action, too many villains, and too much humor, over ponderous, self-serious safety any day.84/100",8,1,2,23 November 2017
Ready Player One," Spielberg Returns to the Blockbuster in This Technologically Astounding Video Game Adventure.
","The King of the Blockbuster is back! In the decade since reuniting with George Lucas and Harrison Ford for the shamefully underrated Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Steven Spielberg has tackled the heavy subjects of World War One, The Emancipation Proclamation, and the Cold War. With the exception of a couple of big budget duds (Tintin and the BFG), the man who practically invented the summer blockbuster had seemed to grow out of crowd-pleasing summer fun. Ready Player One isn't quite a summer movie, but it is in the great tradition of Spielberg Action Extravaganzas. Enormous, assured, and a whole Hell of a lot of fun, RP1 is the type of blockbuster that nobody else in Hollywood is even trying to make. An original script based on an original novel, visualized by a cinematic genius, and played without a constant, prying eye on the sequels, team-ups, and tie-ins... Marvel, eat your heart out.Ready Player One is based on the novel written by Earnest Cline, in which a young gamer, Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) attempts to complete the quest for the Ultimate Easter Egg. Within the virtual world of the OASIS, late creator James Halliday (Mark Rylance) has hidden three keys, which unlock the gate to the Egg, and gives the winner total control over the grandest virtual world ever conceived. Cline's novel had the potential to open itself up to limitless story possibilities. The imagination runs wild thinking of the spectacular challenges that might face Wade's avatar Parzival and his merry team of Egg Hunters (or Gunters), Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), Aech, Daito, and Sho. Cline totally squandered all the potential his premise had. Most of the challenges in the book revolve around playing dated video games (with a controller and TV) within the virtual world, and coasting through such fantastic movie worlds as War Games and Monty Python (sarcasm intended). The book is shockingly unimaginative in the way it plays in what is the world's biggest sandbox. A total rip-off!Thank God for Steven Spielberg. The man has more imagination in his little finger than Cline has in his whole body, and his movie capitalizes on the book's premise as fully as anyone could have hoped for. The first challenge; forget playing an arcade game, how about a sensational race through a virtual New York City? The second challenge; forget playing another arcade game, this time within War Games. How about a rollicking trip through the labyrinth-like Overlook Hotel in The Shining? I won't spoil the final challenge, but take my word for it, like everything in RP1, it is imaginative in ways that Ernie Cline's book never dreamed of.Spielberg realizes how transporting the OASIS would be, and transport us he does. That first race is one of the best action scenes I've seen in years, so much more effective in visualizing space and movement than every other rockem-sockem, building-crumbling, CGI action-fest in theaters today. It has impact. The action of Ready Player One is as loud and chaotic as most disposable modern special effects pictures, but the difference is that with Spielberg, it makes visual and aural sense. The big battles, races, fights, etc. are almost all completely CGI, and the mayhem is cranked up past maximum, but that is what you would expect action in the OASIS to be. The overblown, CG, motion capture world full of nostalgic references is less Spielberg straining for effect than it is a visualization of how our current culture of hyperactive leeching of the past can take over society.And on those digital effects from ILM. It's been years since I've seen a movie that I felt pushed moviemaking technology forward. Avatar might be the last time a film has showcased special effects that felt 'new'. Ready Player One felt new to me. We've all seen so much CGI, motion capture, and the like in movies that the phrase 'How did they do that?' just isn't uttered anymore. Everything is CG, and most CG looks good. The sense of discovery is all but gone. However, throughout this picture I wondered to myself 'How. Did. They. Do. That?' Spielberg uses the special effects here to liberating effect. Anything you can imagine doing in the OASIS is done. It's creativity run amok, and still, you take it all in stride. Imagining what it would be like to search the James Halliday archives or step inside a decades old movie is enough, but Spielberg and ILM's ability to make that stuff real is not to be taken for granted. This is an amazing piece of special effects work, surely deserving of an Oscar, and despite some good performances, especially from Ben Mendelsohn as the corporate villain Nolan Sorrento, it's the best reason to see Ready Player One.What a refreshing movie this Ready Player One is. An original story idea is hard to come by, especially when it comes to popcorn munching entertainment. An original story crafted with an expert eye for cinematic detail is rarer yet. Ready Player One has both. It also has problems. Mostly with the few elements of the book that did make their way to the film. For example, the love story is pointless and half-baked, and the ultimate lesson of 'spend more time in the real world' comes out of nowhere in the last two minutes. But after suffering through years of mind numbing, forgettable summer blockbusters, it sure feels nice to get something this rich, substantial, and genuinely fun. Technologically forward thinking, but with a foot planted firmly in blockbuster past, RP1 is the perfect antidote for all that is wrong with genre film today. My hope is that with this movie, Steven Spielberg can inspire more of this kind of entertainment in Hollywood. But even if other directors don't follow his lead, The King of the Blockbuster has proved that even in 2018, he is still the rightful ruler of the throne.86/100",8,9,17,8 April 2018
The Hateful Eight," In a Hateful World, Tarantino's Intimate Western Epic Shows the Unifying Power of Violence.
","For a filmmaker known for homage, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight functions less like a love letter to a forgotten Hollywood genre than a sincere example of one. It doesn't imitate the classic westerns, it is one. Shot on honest to goodness 70mm film and scored by Ennio Morricone himself, The Hateful Eight plays like a relic unearthed from Hollywood's now ancient past. Its sumptuous technical quality, paired with another sizzling Tarantino script, makes The Hateful Eight a shining beacon in a movie landscape starving for quality, grown up entertainment. It's a big bad mother******, and it's one of the best films of the year.Most of The Hateful Eight takes place in a single cabin. That intimate plot is one of the things that keeps The Hateful Eight feeling distinct from its inspirations. Tarantino turns the film into an Agatha Christie style chamber piece, set against a massive blizzard, where eight mysterious figures work out secrets, lies, and personal vendettas. You can't very well describe The Hateful Eight as a spaghetti western or even a tribute to the spaghetti western because its structure is completely new. Tarantino's script indulges his best impulses. The movie is almost entirely dialogue punctuated by extreme violence. The tense conversations wherein characters play subtle power games with one another in order to uncover secret motives is a staple of the best of Tarantino's writing, and he lets that urge run wild here. The movie is long, nearly three hours, but Tarantino never reaches a creative plateau. The story twists into pretzels, constantly surprising and delighting with new wrinkles. It only gets more complicated, more suspenseful, and more thrilling as it moves towards its resolution.All eight of the principle actors are in fine form, so much so that I have trouble singling any one of them out of the bunch. Samuel L. Jackson is as charismatic as he's been in years, Kurt Russell and Walton Goggins exude real joy in their roles, and others like Tim Roth, Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, and Demian Bichir are textured and complicated. But if I had to pick a standout performance, it would be from Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue, the most vile, nasty woman in film history. It's some kind of brilliant performance, a snarling, sarcastic psychopath who takes repeated punishment only to return the favor in increasingly evil ways. She is the lightning rod to the entire film, the only character that is pure, blood-spitting bad. The story hinges on Kurt Russell's character bringing her to justice and hanging her by the neck until dead.And it is in that story thread that The Hateful Eight becomes truly special. Tarantino and Leigh punish you with Daisy's wretchedness over and over again until you start to believe that total evil will win the day. That is until two characters who began as principle opposites learn to come together for a common goal. The climax of The Hateful Eight is at once both gutturally horrifying and profoundly hopeful. A hanging by an olive branch. In the most Tarantino fashion, he creates a statement about American tensions more moving than a dozen entire movies on the subject. It's about justice, human decency and male camaraderie, and it is satisfying on a spiritual level.The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino let loose. It comes from a writer who feels completely free. Tarantino is doing what he loves, and doing it with an earnest passion. He's making his own legend to stand alongside Leone and Eastwood. It just so happens that when Quentin Tarantino simply messes around and has some fun writing interesting characters, it can be more substantial as a visual and intellectual piece of art than almost anything else.96/100",10,0,2,23 February 2020
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Stephen Sondheim's Gory Opera is Given A Powerful Tim Burton Adaptation
","There are words that pop up all the time when describing Tim Burton and his films: Kooky, Weird, Esoteric, Irreverent. They all fit. The man makes Tim Burton movies, and he's the only one who can. You might be forgiven for thinking that all Tim Burton makes are bizarre, deadpan, mad scientist entertainers. But then, along comes a film like Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. The Stephen Sondheim musical adaptation is a shockingly assured effort from the weirdo auteur. Extremely provocative in its violence and maturity, Sweeney Todd is a major achievement by Burton. Paired with truly great material, he makes the first of his films that I can confidently describe as powerful.After being framed and exiled by the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to Victorian London under the alias of Sweeney Todd to take revenge on the man who stole his wife and child from him. And what sounds like a straightforward revenge plot is then complicated by the arrival of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter), the pie shop owner who finds in Sweeney a devious partner in business and pleasure. Adapted from Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, Sweeney Todd is a story of ever-building darkness, of the gradual blackening of the soul into total despair. Sweeney Todd is one of Sondheim's most well-written musicals, not only in terms of music but of plot and character. There are rich themes and complex characters nestled within what is otherwise a booming musical extravaganza. And while Sondheim's themes are present on stage, they are even more potent in the film. Credit the performances foremostly. Johnny Depp plays Sweeney as a furnace of suppressed anger, distant to Mrs. Lovett, pinpoint-focused on revenge, and bursting with fury when the moment finally comes. Likewise, Bonham-Carter is brilliant in a role she was born to play. She is a delicate psychotic, preening for Todd's love while baking his victims into the Worst Pies in London. There are also professional, understated performances by Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall, and a standout appearance by Sacha Baron Cohen as the flamboyant showman with a darker offstage persona, Pirelli.With the underscoring of an eloquent story to fall back on, Tim Burton is able to flex his filmmaking muscles. It's something we don't often see from Burton, who prefers to keep within his comfort zone of darkly funny mainstream-adjacent fare. With Sweeney Todd, his is forced to break out, and the result is all but perfection. He pulls Sondheim's lyrics inward. Focusing the camera on the characters, placing them in intimate 'stages' and letting them sing with natural gravity. When he does break out of the pie shops and barber chairs, Burton sweeps the camera across the monochromatic beauty of Dante Ferritti's coal-black Londonian production design. And when violence comes, Burton handles it with over-the-top glee. Blood sprays in ridiculous fountains, and you can almost see Burton in the background giggling as we shriek in giddy horror. These moments, or the artful framings (of cracked glass or flames) are there to enhance the emotions of the story. They look incredible, but at the same time, they serve a purpose. There is a distinction that Burton rarely makes. With schlocky material to work from, he often only compensates with visuals. It's a very common criticism of Burton's to say he makes films that look great, but don't register on an emotional or intellectual level. Here, with a solid baseline, his visuals work in tandem with everything else, giving the story even more power.Musically, the film also upstages the stage version. With a cast of untrained singers, the movie takes on a rougher, grittier life. The songs are not belted out, but sung gently and naturally. The approach gives the characters so much more authenticity. They don't turn from characters into singers every time the orchestra picks up. They are characters all the way through, expressing themselves through song in a way that enriches instead of distracting. And still, even with the pared down direction, Sweeney Todd manages to feel just as bombastic and roaring as the stage musical. From the opening explosion of organ music, the orchestral score is thunderously good. At the risk of sounding ignorant, I find the Sweeney Todd film to sound better, in its songs, arrangements, and scoring, than any other stage version I've seen. Almost all the runtime is dedicated to songs, and the way they roll into each other, from No Place Like London into Johanna and Pretty Women into My Friends, is musical genius.Much of the credit for the success of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street has to go to the original writer, Stephen Sondheim. It's a great story, a modern opera with a brilliant sense for storytelling through music. Sondheim is a certified genius when it comes to making this brand of mature, nourishing musical. And because Sondheim is so good, Tim Burton can relax. Burton doesn't push the material too far into his territory. He massages it, pumps it up with enough visual style to enhance its underlying ideas without detracting from it. Directing this musical would have been a high-wire act for any director, and that is why I find myself so shocked at how well Burton pulls it all off. He shows intelligence and skillful cinematic intuition, realizing that part of the thrill of Sweeney Todd is in its Grand Guignol excess, and part is its deeply felt characters. He plays both elements exactly right, knowing when to hold back and when to let loose. Tim Burton was certainly deserving of a best director Oscar nomination, and the film was clearly one of the five best of 2007. But alas, murderous barber musicals are not really the Academy's cup of tea. I'm sure ol' Timmy likes it that way.93/100",9,1,1,11 October 2019
Black Mass," A Bland Look at the Underground Boston Mob Scene, Black Mass Fails to Make Use of a Powerhouse Performance from Johnny Depp.
","I had gotten my hopes up for Black Mass, perhaps too high, when I heard Johnny Depp would be playing the lead role as infamous Boston gangster Whitey Bulger. Combined with director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) it was reasonable to think that Black Mass could be a triumphant return to Donnie Brasco form for Johnny Depp, and a strong gangster picture in its own right. Upon seeing the film, I was disappointed. Depp's Whitey Bulger lives up to the hype, but the movie around his performance never got me hooked.Black Mass recalls a period of time in the mid 1970s when Irish Mob Boss Whitey Bulger began working with his brother, Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) and FBI informant John Connely (Joel Edgerton), to take down the rival Mob families of Boston. Sure, it is an interesting true story, and Whitey Bulger is an interesting real life character, but the film struggles mightily to build a dramatic structure. This should be a movie about personalities, about betrayals and backstabbing. But Black Mass plays more like a documentary. It follows certain characters, but not intimately. Its players serve as parts used to explain the inner workings of the Irish Mob and the FBI. Not as individuals with their own feelings. In a documentary, there is an interest that comes from seeing the actual historical evidence of the story. In a crime drama, you have to do more. I never felt that Black Mass had anything of its own to say about Whitey Bulger, the Mob, or the FBI. The drama in Black Mass is incidental. All I saw was a film that tells me what happened, but not what it meant for anyone involved.The reason Black Mass doesn't work is not because of the performances. Individually, there is some great acting on display. Edgerton and Cumberbatch are convincing as hard boiled Bostonians, and Kevin Bacon gives a performance reminiscent of his work in Mystic River. Depp, however, is the main attraction, and his Whitey Bulger is the first truly Oscar-worthy performance from him in years. Working with cold, blue eyes, he creates a ghostly, menacing figure that can stare at the screen and tell you more about his character than any amount of writing can. And that's a good thing, because Bulger is not much of a character on the page. According to the script, he's a bad-tempered wise guy, a la Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas. But that's it. Depp does all the heavy lifting. He fleshes out Bulger as much as possible, illustrating his fierce connection to his son as well as his hair trigger temper, but it's still not enough to save the film.Black Mass is not a bad film, but it is a misguided one. There are good performances all around, and hints of strong filmmaking, but the movie never managed to grab me. Simply telling Whitey Bulger's story is not enough. With only an admirable Johnny Depp performance to differentiate it from the countless crime dramas that have come and gone in Hollywood, Black Mass is unfortunately forgettable.43/100",4,1,1,5 November 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A Grey, Bland, Dud. In Other Words, 'An Exemplary MCU Masterpiece'
","MCU fans will tell you, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is great. Better than great. The internet is clogged with reviews from endless Youtube pseudo-critics and Marvel shills whose entire cinematic knowledge stems from Breaking Bad and The Dark Knight, calling The Winter Soldier a game-changing masterwork. It is not. It's every bit as dull and uninteresting as every other ephemeral episode of The Marvel Cinematic Money-printing Machine. And it's aggressive mediocrity is yet another piece of evidence in my continuing theory on MCU apologists; they're idiots.That's harsh, I know. Some fans out there are perfectly content admitting that a movie like The Winter Soldier offers only disposable pulp thrills. However, it's the people claiming The Winter Soldier as 'innovative', or 'revolutionary' that really irk me. The chief reason given by these idiots is that Captain America: Winter Soldier is a superhero movie that is also a '70s political espionage thriller'. Let's break it down. Yes, Captain America 2 contains elements of political espionage. The storyline involves two political organizations, S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra, a covert assassin (The Winter Soldier, Sebastian Stan), and Robert Redford (He's from the 70s). This is called window dressing. Surface decorations that evoke the feeling of a conspiracy thriller. What The Winter Soldier does not have is the actual structure of a political thriller. It's an efficiently made, TV-style superhero flick. The good guys punch the bad guys, the cars crash into each other, and the big CGI heli-carriers crumble like peanut brittle.There's nothing wrong with a superhero movie that only does these things. A schlocky action movie can be very enjoyable on that basic level, but only if the film embraces its core identity. When a movie like this fails, it does so because it wastes energy trying to be something else. Captain America: The Winter Soldier pretends to deal with issues. It pretends to be about real figures. But it's pretend. S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra are made-up, and as much as directors Anthony and Joseph Russo want you to recognize these things as analogous to our real institutions, you can't when it's all connected to a silly comic book world where a guy named Falcon flies around blasting machine guns at faceless goons.The cost of this focus on being a half-prestige picture is that nothing is allowed to go over the top. Want more proof that this film's champions are idiots? Look at the fight scenes that they praise as masterclasses in filmmaking. A fist fight in an elevator. Revolutionary! Look at those punches and kicks! It's unlike any other film I've ever seen! A fist fight on a highway. Brilliant! Hand to hand combat! Never before has a hero used his fist to punch another man! #Masterpiece! I can't be living on the same planet as these people. The action in Captain America 2 is not only not revolutionary (That is extremely obvious), it's flat-out bad. Hand to hand fist fights are usually boring by nature. It takes a real master of film craft to overcome the blandness inherent in such a scene. Cameron can do it, Raimi can do it, The Russo Brothers can't come close. There is absolutely no sense of invention in the action. No passion. No ideas at all. Just punches, filmed with detached digital murkiness.I can't think of a better way to describe Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The whole thing is detached. It's a filler TV episode. Efficiently produced, with the fa√ßade of something meaningful, but completely uninterested in personality, life, or genuine fun/excitement/thrills. It's boring, transient garbage that managed to fool stupid people into thinking it was great. Well idiots, you get what you deserve.31/100",3,4,7,25 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A Colorful and Fun, Messy and Limp Ending to a Flawed Trilogy.
","No, I will not join in on the chorus of jeers. I saw this capper to what Disney now calls 'The Skywalker Saga' (a slimy way to ensure more fan fiction is on the way) with expectations for new Star Wars movies pretty well dead. I came away quite content. I don't know for certain, but Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise if Skywalker could be the most purely entertaining of all the Disney Star Wars films. It's fun and adventurous, and not so smug, so already it's a far superior replica of the real Star Wars than The Last Jedi was. The dreadful dourness and awkwardly small structure of that film are replaced with a globe-hopping adventure story that feels in line with what a Star Wars movie ought to do. The Rise of Skywalker is also an unruly mess, but give me that over a cleverly written bore any time.Rise's reputation suggests it is a course-correction from The Lat Jedi, picking up where The Force Awakens left off and mitigating any consequences of Rian Johnson's story. While part of that is true; the film does gloss over major plot points of its predecessor, it actually functions most like a self-enclosed one-off story. Now, Emperor Palpatine is back, there are a couple new threats to go along with him (The Final Order and the Knights of Ren), and our heroes continue their spunky fight for good. It feels as if very little is being carried over from the other sequels. Instead, brand new characters, situations, and McGuffins are introduced throughout. Unsurprisingly, this gives most of the movie a terribly rushed feeling, where even the action beats don't seem to last long enough before it's on to something else. The young quartet of actors are exactly as you would expect at this point, lively and enthusiastic, bordering on overbearing. Adam Driver is once again the most interesting of the bunch, and the decision to put him back in the mask is a good one (what can I say, he looks cool). Unfortunately, old heroes Leia and Lando are forced into hurried cameos. Carrie Fisher being long dead is quite the hurdle, but at least she gets a dignified sendoff.The story, all the chasing after different mystical items and relaying information to and through spies, is neither here nor there. What matters most in The Rise of Skywalker is the entertainment value. On that front, it's great. Most impressive is the movie's eye-popping visuals. Rise is incredibly satisfying to look at. Brilliant, filmic color, exciting pace with the camerawork (something J.J. Abrams is exceptionally good at), and gorgeous set design and special effects make Episode IX a candy-colored dream. What the movie lacks in imagination, it makes up for with craft. Sets, puppets, animatronics, and CGI abound. I have called The Force Awakens the most polished movie ever made. Rise may have it beat.Although it may feel like the action scenes come hot and heavy in this film, there aren't really that many set-pieces. The pace comes more from Abrams' style and the fact that some of the chases and fights go by so quickly that it seems to be more action packed than it actually is. That said, the midway lightsaber duel is visually exciting and the final space and ground battle is fantastic fun. If you can give into the zany spirit, you can have a real good time.The Rise of Skywalker was never going to have much impact as a conclusion to the series because the whole sequel trilogy has been no more than the deformed tumor growing off the side of Lucas' actual saga from the beginning. This finale is more of a salvage job than a true conclusion. The trilogy has not been building to anything, so whatever Rise closes has only been opened along its own runtime. It's impossible not to look at how Revenge of the Sith handled the task of ending the saga. Sith took compounding story threads, both political and personal, from both its previous films, and brought them to their logical climax. All the while, connecting old threads in a way that closes the circle of all six movies. It was a movie that felt, in every moment, like an epic finale. It even ended on a shot so emotionally perfect and thematically resonant that The Rise of Skywalker had no choice but to ape it. But Rise has none of that feeling of finality. It's another colorful distraction, albeit one where characters die and wars are won.Looking back on the whole Sequel Trilogy project makes one really appreciate the cyclical storytelling brilliance of episodes I-VI. The way they thematically weave together, all the while being unique, daring, visionary, and unafraid to be silly. But that's with George Lucas, an artist, at the helm. With Disney, Star Wars has smoothed out the quirks and beefed up the effects. As far as fan fiction goes, I'm happy with that approach. As long as you can recognize that these are bald-faced corporate cash grabs, you'll find that they are relatively enjoyable as bald-faced corporate cash grabs go (I'm not sure that applies to The Last Jedi, but nevertheless). I look for these non-Lucas movies to entertain me, and this one did. That is all I require anymore.73/100",7,3,9,1 July 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Underrated Star Wars Adventure, Full of Intrigue, Drama, and Jaw-Dropping Fun
","Much like its predecessor, Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones has gained a rather sour reputation on the internet. Fortunately, many of the popular complaints about this film are either highly exaggerated or downright wrong. Chapter two of the Star Wars Saga is an energized and highly enjoyable two hours at the movies.Attack of the Clones follows Anakin Skywalker ten years after his exploits in The Phantom Menace. An older Anakin, played surprisingly well by Hayden Christiansen, is now training under the watchful eye of Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi. Searching the Internet, you won't find many fans who praise Christiansen's performance, but I found him to be very effective in the young, arrogant hotshot role he'd been given. McGregor does similarly well in the older brother, mentor role. I enjoyed Episode I a lot, but the story is much more focused this time, with major events happening for Anakin, and an actual political conflict engulfing the Republic. The two major story lines in the film are, one, the political underpinnings that eventually lead to the start of the infamous Clone Wars, and two, the personal story of Anakin Skywalker, including the romance between him and the former Queen, Padme Amidala. The first of these story lines is wildly interesting, following the two opposing forces of the Clone Wars, The Republic and their clone army, and the Seperatists and their droid battalion, as they prepare for an imminent war. After an assassination attempt on Senetor Amidala, Obi-Wan embarks on a detective mission to a track down the people behind the plot. The political espionage and behind-the-scenes dealings make for a fascinating and focused story. The other major storyline is not as focused, but still works as a chapter in Anakin Skywalker's overall story. Anakin and Padme's love story works as a throwback to the grand, old-fashioned film romances of the 1930s and 40s (think Gone With the Wind), but for contemporary audiences, the few extended scenes of corny 'love speech' dialogue might be pretty drab. However, these aren't as distracting or offensive as some claim. In fact, a couple of them actually work well, such as the meadow picnic, where Padme and Anakin discuss the futility of politics in the beautiful fields of Naboo. The actors have chemistry, and both are likable, especially Natalie Portman as Padme. Yes the love story can be a bit forced, and sometimes drab, but it fits the feel of the saga. It is a grand, sweeping, throwback to Hollywood's golden age.If the love story might be hit or miss, it's the other facet of Anakin's character arc that Lucas gets absolutely right. Plagued by visions of his mother in pain, Anakin takes Padme to Tatooine where he tracks down his mother, only to see her die in his arms. His response is chilling and powerful. The scene between him and Padme in a garage after he brings his mom's body back is perfectly executed, unveiling a dark, angry side of Anakin, while simultaneously showing his frailty and confusion. It truly is one of the very best scenes in the saga.Even if you didn't find the story as interesting as I did, there is no question that Episode II is an audio/visual feast for the senses. Lucas and company introduce a stunning variety of sprawling landscapes, crazy creatures, fanciful vehicles, and formidable weapons. Once again, the sheer amount of imagination contained in this world is unbelievable. While Attack of the Clones does tend to favor CGI backgrounds and creatures too much, it still looks undeniably cool. The nighttime skyline of Coruscant, the rain-drenched clone facility on Kamino, the termite mound planet of Geonosis; They all, along with the creatures that inhabit them, feel real, and look great. On these beautiful planets, we are treated to tons of terrific Star Wars action. George Lucas once again revels in directing off-the-wall fun. This film is an adventure through and through. Set-pieces range from a one-on-one battle between bounty hunter Jango Fett and Obi- Wan on the rainy platforms of Kamino to a gladiator-like fight against intergalactic monsters. The last half hour of the film particularly impresses, with a massive battle between the two giant armies, dozens of Jedis, and a helping of fantastic war machines. The whole thing ends with an epic face-off that sees Yoda battle with mind and sword against Christopher Lee's devilishly evil Count Dooku, a memorable villain with an air of gravitas. He's a classic Hollywood archetype with a Star Wars spin; an elegant villain who just happens to have a lightsaber (with an awesome curved handle) and can shoot lightning from his hands.Needless to say, Attack of the Clones is much better than its reputation suggests. Complaints of poor story, too much politics, and 'fake' looking CGI are almost completely unfounded, and the few moments of clich√©d dialogue (the only complaint I can really understand) are such a small part of the film, that I barely notice them. However, for some reason that I honestly can't understand, it has become increasingly more 'uncool' to like this film. Personally, I value energy and atmosphere in a blockbuster like this, and Episode II of the Star Wars Saga is packed with it. Attack of the Clones is a grand, sweeping, large-scale adventure. The story is mostly great, with only a few stretches that drag, and as with all the Star Wars movies (especially the prequels), the special effects and action are top notch. That is, after all, why you watch the Star Wars movies; to visit unknown worlds and have a ton of fun doing so. Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones isn't a world-class lesson in dialogue, but between the visual spectacle, first-rate action, and heavenly John Williams score, it is entertainment of the highest degree.86/100",9,166,232,2 December 2015
The Matrix Revolutions," A Different Kind of Matrix-Flavored Action Spectacular.
","With expectations significantly lowered by The Matrix Reloaded's ridiculous pseudo-philosophical hogwash, the trilogy closer, The Matrix Revolutions, came as a bloody, brutal, action-packed surprise. No one can expect a Matrix sequel to compete with the Wachowski's visionary original, but even by dumb summer action standards, The Matrix Reloaded was too pompous for its britches. The half-baked (in every sense) ramblings came at the expense of pace and fun. Revolutions rectifies this with a story that is easier to follow, and a greater embrace of The Matrix' inherent goofiness.I won't pretend to remember what exactly Reloaded was about. At this point in the trilogy, the rules for what can and can't happen, who is jacked in and who is a program, where anybody is at any given time, and why anybody is fighting anybody else in The Matrix, were, at best, muddled. Inheriting this mess from themselves, the Wachowski's decided to slim down the exposition for Revolutions. In essence, all you need to know about Matrix 3 is that the real-life humans are fighting a war against real-life machines, and Neo is trying to save the Matrix from Agent Smith. Any questions of 'why' can be answered with one word: 'love'. Sure, it's simple minded, borderline stupid, but it gives orientation that Reloaded lacked. I will even admit to feeling rather struck by a character death or two. The unwieldy strings are tied together more or less satisfactorily by the finale.Like the original Matrix or its first sequel, Revolutions is a huge science-fiction action spectacular. But where Reloaded came across as re-heated leftovers of the Gun-Fu Matrix style, Revolutions takes a different direction: massive, CGI, robot battle overkill. Those who scoff immediately whenever special effects begin to fill the screen, miss out on how exciting these sequences can be, especially when the effects work as well as they do here. There is real invention to the action of The Matrix Revolutions. You get the sense that the Wachowskis are having a blast visualizing the giant drills crashing through the human's fortified dome city, the swarms of flying octopus robots, or the mech-suits as they fire unending streams of bullets at the invaders. There are a couple bullet-timey shootouts and fight scenes that recall the first film, but they aren't given the spotlight. Rather, Revolutions biggest and best scenes are its most overblown. The centerpiece Siege of Zion clocks in at a happily indulgent half hour plus, and the climactic fight is the rainiest, punchiest, most epic super-powered brawl you're likely to ever see (And boy does it make me wish we'd get a Superman movie with that kind of energy).I, for one, don't find the Wachowski's world-building in the Matrix to be all that interesting. The high-concept premise of the first movie was a bolt of creative genius, but the attempts to bolster that premise generally fall flat. That said, in a movie that prioritizes action spectacle over dour philosophy, I can buy into it. I was rooting for those scrappy humans in The Matrix Revolutions, as dull as they may seem. I was thrilled by the battle scenes and over-the-top fights. Plus, I was interested in finding out what was going to happen by the end. Because things do happen by the end. There are resolutions, denouements, and grandiose, epic music from Don Davis which fits the images much better than the early 2000s techno-crud from Reloaded. This is a very good movie when accepted on its own terms. A screamy, sweaty, slam-bang great time at the cineplex.83/100",8,0,0,12 June 2020
Cast Away," Parable of Life on a Deserted Island
","'I've got to keep breathing because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?'For a film noted for its sparseness, Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away is one of the richest film-going experiences I have ever had. It is a story of mythic simplicity: a man, stranded alone on an island. And yet, this film contains multitudes.Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Fed Ex executive whose life is dictated by the clock. The love of his life is Kelly Frears, played by Helen Hunt. While performing a routine delivery, Noland's Fed Ex aircraft crashes, and he washes ashore on a small tropical island. These are the select few components of Cast Away's plot. The film is carried almost completely by character and theme. Once the story gets to the island, the movie becomes a deeply reflective allegory. William Broyles Jr.'s script is fluid, moving organically around its central character, following him through the trials of island survival and the human mind. It is impossible to discuss Cast Away without mentioning Tom Hanks. Hanks' performance is an all-encompassing master class. He is tasked with selling every conceivable emotion from sorrow, heartache, fear, and misery, to hope, joy, and optimism in his time in and off the island. Then there is the physical transformation from plump Everyman to raw, naked vulnerability as an emaciated creature of the jungle. We spend an extreme amount of time with Tom Hanks in Cast Away. He is so layered, so pitch perfect in every moment, that you never want to leave him.Zemeckis excels with the details of Noland's years-long struggle to survive. The direction is intimate and tactile, placing us right there with Chuck as he uses relatable ingenuity (he is never superhumanly intelligent) to fight for each new day. While so much of the pleasure of watching Cast Away is the realism in which it depicts island survival, The film is always operating on the level of myth or fable. The island is not simply a setting. Fire is not simply a source of warmth. A volleyball is not simply a toy. Deeper meaning permeates every pore of Cast Away. When Chuck Noland washes up on that island, he lays out the pieces of human desire. Longing, desperation, joy, companionship, hopelessness, and resilience. Those tenets of the human heart are what Cast Away is really about. The story is told completely in metaphor, lending every small moment an impact that goes beyond the surface. What is so remarkable among all of these ideas is the entertainment value encased within them. Tom Hanks makes wonderful company, and Robert Zemeckis wisely finds room for humor. Cast Away is also a beautiful looking and sounding film. It works on very basic levels as well as the metaphorical ones.Finally, in a third act that left many wrongly underwhelmed, Cast Away reveals itself as, among many other things, a suicide parable, and it's themes crescendo. In one of the greatest monologues of Hanks' career, we're given a line that transcendently crystallizes the film's messages. A line that has stuck with me for years, and one that I believe has the power to change lives. To anyone who has ever experienced intense loneliness or depression, anyone who has felt hopeless in the face of the enormity of life's challenges, Cast Away is a spiritual journey. The movie holds a special personal connection to myself, as someone who has been emotionally paralyzed by depression. Like me, it doesn't wallow in sadness, but instead pushes toward gentle optimism about overcoming it. It provides a pillar to my own philosophy. An extraordinary inspiration when I feel marooned within my own life.99/100",10,1,1,9 March 2020
Split," My Reaction to Shyamalan's Latest?... Split.
","You won't find me talking of the Shyamalannaissance anytime soon. Partly because I don't think the worst of the infamous director's catalog were that bad to begin with, and partly because his second 'comeback' film (After 2015's surprisingly effective, The Visit), is not that good.Split is a return to psychological horror for Shyamalan. It stars James McAvoy as a disturbed mental patient with 23 unique personalities, who kidnaps three girls in a mall parking lot, and keeps them locked away in an underground bunker. Their bid for escape provides most of Split's plot. The hook here is the multiple personalities. The film asks, what would it be like to be at the mercy of a man who can be anyone? One minute he is a calculated assassin, the next he is a loving nanny in women's clothing. Ok, interesting. Coupled with Shyamalan's skill with claustrophobic tension, there's a real winner buried in this story. Unfortunately, the movie we got doesn't work.Split has been praised by many for James McAvoy's performance(s) as the diverse personalities. I guess this is my biggest issue with the film. I don't think McAvoy's acting is brilliant. In fact, I think it's a mediocre performance. His character represents a kind of acting exercise you might give budding thespians. Take a handful of wildly different people and make them distinct. On that level, McAvoy does just fine. But that's an acting exercise. A movie character, a good one anyway, needs more. It needs a spark that not anybody can provide. McAvoy's interpretations are simplistic and obvious. There's nothing under the surface. No juice to these people. They are written as cliches, sure (excitable young boy, effeminate fashion designer, etc.), but McAvoy simply mimics these cliches, rather than raise them to a higher level.But it's not totally James McAvoy's fault the movie didn't grab me. M. Night Shyamalan turns in a script that is far below his talents. In addition to the girls' escape plans, the plot devotes a good portion of time to 'The Beast', a personality of McAvoy's that is said to be supernaturally gifted physically. People talk about The Beast, warn of his arrival, and perform various other superficial tension-building dialogue. It all leads to an underwhelming climax that culminates in a Shyamalan twist that has no impact now that it has been revealed to the world. There's also the problem that Split is not very scary. The moments that are supposed to shock, are well-directed (Horror is where Shyamalan has always had a keen eye), but once again, there is a bridge they don't cross. I could sit back and remark at the craft of the tense scenes, but they never really grabbed me.Split is not a bad movie, but it blows its opportunity to be good. There is an interesting idea, and a good horror concept at work in the script, but it needs another run or two through the typewriter. As it stands, it is not worthy of a recommendation from me.51/100",4,0,2,22 January 2019
Little Miss Sunshine," A Ray of Sunshine in a Dreary Genre.
","Every kind of movie genre has potential for greatness. I have to remind myself of this from time to time. The is a certain hopelessness you feel when you watch dozens of trashy horror movies or pretentious art house films without finding a great one. But it's films like Little Miss Sunshine that convince you to keep searching. This movie plays like a lot of would be 'feel good' indie pictures. A happy little goofball of a film complete with an offbeat sense of humor and an eclectic group of quirky characters. Those are dangerous waters. Way too often does 'quirky' give way to cloying. Except these characters are quirky like real people are, not like overwritten movie characters. And this movie is real and affecting, not tongue in cheek or sarcastic. Little Miss Sunshine is a winner.The film could be classified as a road movie (another dangerously corny genre), following the extended Hoover family on a road trip to a child's beauty pageant in California, where Abigail Breslin's Olive dreams of competing to be Little Miss Sunshine. The group escorting Breslin there are mom Sheryl (Toni Collette), dad Richard (Gregg Kinnear), sweet gay uncle Frank (Steve Carrell), aspiring Air Force pilot brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), and wise-cracking grandpa Edwin (Alan Arkin). What follows is a delightful series of gags, many of them featuring a beaten up yellow VW van, that slowly build to something emotionally impactful.The acting from all six of the main players is brilliant. A case could be made for any of them to be nominated for Oscars. Alan Arkin won an Oscar for his prickly grandpa Edwin and Abigail Breslin received deserved acclaim for her winning turn, but the best performance of the film comes from Gregg Kinnear. His character has the widest emotional range, and Kinnear has a deft touch at every step. It's a classically restrained acting job. I have to also mention Toni Collette, who delivers a particularly stirring monologue at a crucial point in the film.The gags and one-liners could all end up so precious, so self-consciously offbeat. That is death for indie movies. I can't stand it when it's done wrong. So what a surprise it was for me to find myself caught up in this particular group's story. It's because supporting all those fine performances is direction that is restrained and natural. Never once do directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris push for laughs. There is a humble quality to the humor. A 'we hope you'll enjoy it, but that's up to you' attitude. And underneath the comedy is sincerity. Faris and Dayton treat these characters as people. People who are susceptible to grief, anger, and sadness, just like the rest of us. They aren't sock puppets speaking the writer's stand up material.I don't like road pictures or indie movies or quirky comedies. I sometimes find it hard to believe there could be a truly great example of any of the three. But Little Miss Sunshine is special; a great example of all those genres. It's a wonderful movie about family and the special connection they have to all of us. It's hilarious and touching and quirky, yes, in the right way. Little Miss Sunshine may look like other cutesy darlings, but give it a chance and you'll find it a genuine delight.94/100",10,0,0,10 November 2019
Wanted," Stylish Snuff
","To call Wanted an 'action movie' would be like calling Cannibal Holocaust a 'horror flick'. This movie is one step removed from being the most stylish snuff film ever made. Wanted is full of flair, inventive action scenes, and good special effects and sound, but it is thoroughly violent. Taken on craft alone, Wanted is good, but factor in the effect of the endless scenes of vicious, bloody murder, and this becomes a film you endure rather than enjoy.Wanted is about James McAvoy's Wesley, a frustrated office worker who is recruited by Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman into an underground assassin community to finish his legendary gun master father's last job. Or at least that is what the plot summary is about. In reality, Wanted is about violence. Lots and lots of increasingly brutal violence. Wesley and Fox (Jolie) kill gobs of hulking thugs, sometimes in creative ways, but always with bullets. Lots of bullets. And that's the movie, basically. Characters stop and talk here and there, but almost no single scene ends without somebody getting maimed or killed.Those scenes of protracted murder start out kind of fun. There are some imaginative sniper scenes, with long slow motion tracking shots of the bullet as it passes through the air, and Fox teaches Wesley to curve bullets in a memorable early scene. Director Timur Bekmambetov takes a hard-edged, gritty kind of style and rolls with it. For about an hour, you might get caught up in the mayhem. By the end, it's just too much. The movie is under two hours, but without any kind of engaging story to prop up the action, fatigue sets in quick. As things get more and more gruesome, the slickness of the bloodshed is lost, replaced by a feeling of nauseous unpleasantness. I understand Wanted is no family film, and I can get into angry, stress-relieving ultra-violence as much as anybody, but Wanted is a bridge too far for me. It is a very mean spirited movie, taking way too much gleeful pleasure in blowing the brains out of hundreds of heads. That's where the movie really crossed into snuff territory for me. I can handle violence. I can handle very gruesome violence. But the kind of sustained gun porn seen in Wanted would test anyone's stomach. The action is done well, and in a shorter, more absorbing story, it would work. By itself, drawn out over almost two hours, it doesn't. Your results may vary, but after a while, I was entirely turned off by Wanted.54/100",5,1,2,6 June 2018
Spider-Man," Iconic, Electrifying, Classy, Vibrant, and Emotionally Stimulating, Spider-Man Represents the Gold Standard in Superhero Blockbusters
","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies 'Look, it's Spider-Man!', fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not 'more' than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100",10,103,114,5 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man," Sony and Marc Webb's Attempt to Recreate Perfection Swings and Misses.
","When dealing with comic book characters, you know studios can't let a good thing die. Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man film is one of the greatest comic book adaptations ever made. Not only did it have groundbreaking special effects and action, but it had a perfect cast, a mature love story, and themes of growing up and becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. It was a definitive take on the character. Yet, here we are with The Amazing Spider-Man. Just five years after Raimi finished his Spider-Man trilogy, this origin reboot was commissioned by Sony; and for what purpose? Marc Webb's Spider-Man brings nothing new to the table, instead opting to try its hand at its own version of Spider-Man's origin. You know what they say about trying to recreate perfection.The Amazing Spider-Man is nothing more than a remake of Raimi's first movie. Sure, We get a half-baked romance between Peter and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and a fully uncooked subplot about Peter's dead parents, but those plot threads are window dressing at best. It's another origin. The difference? This one sucks. In an effort to appeal to the nerds who equate comic book faithfulness to quality, some details are tweaked. For instance, Spidey uses mechanical web shooters instead of Raimi's more dramatically potent natural version (which worked as a symbol for bodily changes during puberty), because the comics are always right, right? In the end, these superfluous changes mean nothing. This is the 2002 film, just way worse.The villain this time is The Lizard, one of my favorite spidey rogues. It's nice that he's in the movie, but he's completely wasted. Rhys Ifans plays a boring British scientist, who might as well be a parody of boring British scientists. He brings nothing of the warmth that Dylan Baker brought to the role in what was basically an extended cameo over 2 films, and as a special effect, The Lizard is even worse. The design is ugly (Webb went for a lizard/human hybrid look that would be more at home in the tie-in video game than the actual film), and the CGI is rudimentary. By 2012, I thought I had seen the last of that herky-jerky 90s era computer animation. I was wrong.The problem with all the revisited plot points is that every single one of them has been done infinitely better ten years prior. Compare any scene to Raimi's version, and it's unmistakable, one is a work of giddy passion and the other is a contract. Forget the clearly inferior compositions, set design, cinematography, and casting. At some point, you have to step back from all the little details and realize, this is barely even a film compared to the original. It feels like a TV pilot for a direct-to-Netflix Spider-Man show. How can a film with such a big budget end up so cheap?There is a fundamental problem with The Amazing Spider-Man. The handling of Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is all wrong. There is something non-negotiable about the character of Peter Parker, something essential to his personality. He has to be uncool. Tobey Maguire brought to the role a sweet, boyish naivet√©. Garfield's version is a sulky male-model. He skateboards, talks to girls, and rejects authority. You can't make Peter Parker edgy and hip. It goes completely against what the character is all about. He can't be 'cool'. Andrew Garfield is way off the mark with his performance, and he is not alone. His counterpart, Emma Stone, is equally repulsive to me, but that might have more to do with my general disdain for Stone as an actress. She's too gruff and crude for my liking. Unfortunately, the movie lives and dies by your connection between these two characters. I found them grating to an extreme. They're nails on the chalkboard whenever they're on screen.There is action in The Amazing Spider-Man, but even it is no saving grace for the film. Director Marc Webb, another example of certain studios' inexplicable pattern of hiring quirky indie directors to helm big-budget action blockbusters, is apparently lost when it comes to envisioning or generating any kind of exciting sequence. The set-pieces are lame. I've seen all the rooftop fights and high-tech labs a person can see. If you're going to hang your hat on these set-pieces, you need to be a special kind of filmmaker. Raimi is, Webb is not. He handles the camera with nothing of Raimi's slick confidence. His action is diverting, but it is devoid of any style, any dynamism, any life. To make matters worse, almost all the action in the film is set at night, and its all smothered in this murky, dim sheen. The muted, gray, 'realistic' cinematography represents The Amazing Spider-Man's head-scratching desire to be gritty (a Hollywood word meaning devoid of color, style, or individual artistic license), and it does nothing but hurt the film.The Amazing Spider-Man was made to ensure that Sony could keep the rights to Spider-Man and it shows. There's no shaking the feeling of cold studio contract fulfillment that infects the film. Marc Webb was hired to get the script on screen and nothing more. The final product checks all the boxes Sony thought pertinent to check, but collectively, it is useless. There is no individuality, no heart, no soul, nothing to The Amazing Spider-Man. It might look nice here or there, and some of the effects are impressive, but The Amazing Spider-Man is an empty experience. It's a forgettable origin story, rendered downright antagonizing by a pair of extremely unlikable leads. Sony and Marc Webb set out to re-envision Spider-Man for a new generation. Newsflash, perfection doesn't need re-envisioning. The Amazing Spider-Man is one big mistake. I hoped Sony and Marc Webb could at least take Spider-Man in a fun, new direction. What they did was a cobble together a disposable imitation of Sam Raimi's game-changing original.33/100",3,5,15,1 June 2016
Aliens," Bigger, Meaner, More Action-Packed. Aliens Is a Crude, but Bitchin' Sequel
","When Aliens hit theaters in 1986, it's predecessor, Ridley Scott's Alien, was already a science-fiction classic, and it's director, James Cameron, was a relative unknown in Hollywood. Coming on the heels of his surprise hit, The Terminator, Cameron blew the doors off what anyone was expecting to see in a sequel to Alien. Aliens was a huge, ambitious sci-fi action spectacular that traded quiet horror for slam bang pyrotechnics. It was a rousing success in 1986, but looking back at it today reveals some cracks. As per usual for a James Cameron film, Aliens is a rock solid story with some totally badass moments, but unlike Cameron's later work, it never quite captures the exquisite craftsmanship and event movie feel of The Abyss through Avatar.57 years after the destruction of the Nostromo, Ellen Ripley is discovered by a deep salvage team and recruited to join a team of Colonial Marines on a mission to a colonized moon that has been overrun by a horde of xenomorphs. It's a genius story premise by Cameron, taking the seeds planted in Alien, and growing them, naturally, into something bigger and better. This is what sequels always strive for, and rarely achieve. Aliens is a completely different kind of film from Alien, but it extends organically from it. It's also better than Alien. More exciting, more fun, and with a more potent emotional core.Sigourney Weaver is far and away the standout of the cast, which is otherwise comprised of the old Cameron standbys, hard-core chicks (Janette Goldstein as Vasquez), military grunts (Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton), and greedy corporate men (Paul Reiser). Weaver is fantastic as a woman traumatized by the events of Alien, who finds purpose in the protection of a stranded young girl named Newt (Carrie Henn). Her Ripley is one hell of a character. Fearful yet warm, determined but motherly, and in the end, a complete badass. Her Oscar nomination was unquestionably deserved.For a film famous for its action, with the greatest action director of all time at the helm and a story perfectly designed for rip-roaring thrills, it's almost a disappointment that Aliens is merely very good when it comes to the action set-pieces. The big alien ambush at the center of the movie is exciting, the facehugger attack is tense, and the marines' last stand against the xenomorph warriors is a great example of controlled mayhem. These scenes, however, don't have quite the polish I expect from Cameron action. It isn't until the last thirty minutes or so of the film, when Ripley begins her battle with the Alien Queen, that Aliens' action takes off. That final chunk of sustained action is the first taste the world got of just how special a director James Cameron could be. When Ripley steps out of the elevator, a giant gun in hand, the movie surges into overdrive. The Alien Queen is a brilliant concept in and of herself, and Cameron's direction of the entire sequence is superb. He saves his best for last, and introduces himself as a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood.It may sound blasphemous to some, but I think Aliens is crying out for a George Lucas-style special edition. Don't get me wrong, the alien effects by Stan Winston are great. The warrior xenomorphs are frighteningly designed and mostly free in their movements. The Alien Queen is one of the great large scale puppets in film history, an iconic creature. The effects work. But they aren't perfect. There is a crudeness to many of the effects. The miniatures sometimes look like toys, the xenomorphs sometimes move stiffly, and there are often visible wires and other mechanisms. It hampers what Cameron can do with the action. I think a conservative use of CGI would enhance the film, and liberate it from the constraints of the era and the film's small budget. Aliens was so ambitious, it deserved a bigger budget and more polished effects.The movie, as is, still rocks. The story is simply a stroke of genius, and the action is bolstered by a powerhouse performance by Sigourney Weaver. Aliens represents the transitional period of James Cameron's career, from enterprising low-budget fare to monumental event movies. There are moments of greatness in Aliens, even if the general unvarnished quality sticks like a pebble in its shoe. The structure of the film and its 'in-your-face' attitude carry the day, but even so, I find myself imagining how breathtaking the movie might have been if Cameron made it with the resources available to him in the 1990s or 2000s. Despite my few nagging hangups with Aliens, the movie deserves its status as an action classic. Watching it with modern eyes, I can't call it a masterpiece, but I can call it a damn good time at the movies. Aliens is not a state-of-the-art thrill ride, but even a bumpy, slightly dated roller coaster is worth riding.84/100",8,1,3,14 July 2018
Quantum of Solace," Bond Without Any of the Action, Spectacle, or Fun You'd Expect
","Quantum of Solace is the follow-up to the electrifying reboot of the 007 franchise, Casino Royale. By the end of that film, I have to say, I was ecstatic about the direction the Bond films were heading. If you haven't seen it, Casino Royale told what was basically a James Bond origin story. It showed how Bond became the legend we see today, and by the film's end, it seemed as though Bond was back. It gave the impression that the next film would show 007 in all his classic glory, with action, gadgets, exotic locations, and spy thrills. Instead, Quantum of Solace turns out to be a hollow, depressing exercise in new age 'gritty' action movies. I won't bother with the story of Quantum of Solace because frankly, I didn't understand it. What I do know is that the interesting, over-the-top villains and their diabolical schemes are long gone from this Bond flick. Replaced instead with bland, confusing political espionage, and a completely forgettable bad guy (And I mean FORGETTABLE. The only thing I can remember about him was that he wore a suit), Quantum of Solace ditches the traditional Bond formula in favor of 'realism'. Unfortunately, realism doesn't translate to quality. Even accounting for the incomprehensible plot and forgettable characters, there is still something in Quantum of Solace to, at the very least, get excited about. That thing would be the action. I remember seeing the trailer and being absolutely giddy. 'A classic Aston Martin car chase, a speedboat set-piece, a breathtaking motorbike stunt, and a hand-to-hand fight, Bond is back baby!'. In the actual film, these shots are undeniably great, but the big catch is that all (yes, all) of the action from the trailer takes place during the opening scene of the film. The film's best stunts, set-pieces, and moments are stuffed into one five-minute sequence at the very start of the movie, leaving the rest of the film to sit flat as a board until the equally underwhelming climax.Quantum of Solace is not a Bond film. The fun typically associated with James Bond is nowhere to be found, and the bookend action scenes are certainly not enough to overcome this. Now, Bond can be realistic; I think Casino Royale and even Skyfall did a great job of putting Bond in a realistic setting. The difference is that those films retained the elements that make the James Bond franchise great. Quantum of Solace is embarrassed by the classic Bond films, ditching anything fun and anything over- the-top in favor of 'gritty realism'. The result is a completely joyless endeavor, and one of the worst Bond movies of them all.30/100",3,23,33,7 November 2015
Mamma Mia!," Amiable Pop Musical, Short on Story, Big on Cheer
","Mamma Mia!, the film adaptation of the popular stage musical, packs no surprises, no new insights, no real emotions, but it never had to. Like the popular Broadway play, Mamma Mia! is a sweet, summery tonic of wholesome good cheer. The kind of which that women and families will drink up, even if the nutritional content is low.The plot, (you know, that thing in between the ABBA music) is about bride-to-be Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) and her quest to discover the identity of her real father by inviting the three possible candidates to her mother's beautiful Greek villa, in hopes that she will 'just know'. Things aren't so simple in practice however, as Donna (Meryl Streep) rekindles flames she thought were lost forever. It's not a horrible idea for a story, it's not a great idea, but it's cute. The three suitors, played by Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsg√•rd, are instantly appealing. Put a less likable actor in any of their shoes and you would have yourself a far less tolerable film.Most of the leads are charming, with Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep standing out. One could criticize both their singing voices, if one were so inclined, but I enjoyed Streep's airy vocals and Brosnan's deep, hard rock style. The ABBA songs are hit or miss, with some lethargic early songs, and a few vivacious tunes to close the film. The music is what you would expect. Every musical has some duds, but Mamma Mia! has enough good stuff to justify them. The film pulls a nice balancing act when it comes to the songs, not too many, (ABBA overkill never fully sets in), and the best stuff is saved for last. Pretty good formula, if you ask me.I'm not the best audience for Mamma Mia! I've never seen the play, I don't particularly like ABBA, and I'm not a woman. For those who fit into any of those categories, Mamma Mia! will be a joy. I wasn't impressed with some of the formulaic chick flick fluff, but beyond that, I liked Mamma Mia! It's what your grandmother might call a 'nice' picture. Wholesome, charming, and sugary sweet.66/100",6,0,0,19 May 2018
Batman Begins," Mature Batman Origin Story With Enough Comic Book Flair To Satisfy Fans Of Every Kind
","Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat, as it were, with Joel Schumacher's childish mess, 'Batman and Robin', Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton's two Batman movies, it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since.Batman Begins is an origin story straight through, detailing Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) emergence from tragically scarred child to a symbol of heroism and darkness. After training with Ra's al Ghul and the League of Shadows, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham in perfect mental and physical shape. What Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer do perfectly here, is inject Bruce Wayne with an emotion never before seen in a Batman movie. You can feel the pain and grief Wayne is experiencing and you can see why he decides to become a living symbol of good. The first full origin story for Batman on film, Batman Begins is very much told from Bruce's point of view. Earlier Batman movies often focused more heavily on developing the villains, leaving Bruce Wayne in the shadows. The approach that keeps Batman a dark, mysterious figure is a valiant one, and it makes sense. However, context rarely hurts, and Batman Begins provides the character with heaps of context. You can clearly understand the emotions and motivations of the man behind the mask. The origin is also utterly believable. You can see why Bruce Wayne dresses like a bat, why he needs a cape, how he gets a super-car and super-gadgets, and why he hides in a cave. Does it strip Batman of his mythic status? Yes, a bit. Luckily, unlike Nolan's two follow-ups, Begins doesn't get too carried away with realism, retaining a comic book style that its successor would forget.While it does take a while for Bruce Wayne to fully become the bat, it is worth it. Once Bruce Wayne finally dons the cape and cowl, there are a few jaw-dropping action scenes including a brilliant batmobile chase scene and a thrilling climax on Gotham's elevated trains. The atmosphere and feeling of Gotham City is nearly perfect in it's own way. It does not have the Gothic beauty of Tim Burton's Batman universe, but it's blend of comic book dinginess and contemporary sleekness makes Gotham a terrifically realized cityscape. The city feels like what a comic book world would be like if it actually existed. Batman himself is a dark, brooding, wonderfully realized character in his own right and he shares the screen with an ensemble of great actors. Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon are standouts in an ensemble cast that is playing the comic book material straight as an arrow. Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow is an excellent but criminally underused baddie, but on the whole, the supporting cast elevates the material.Batman Begins is still as fresh today as it was more than a decade ago. The origin of Batman is engaging, engrossing, and emotional. The story provides a context to the Bruce Wayne character that elevates the movie beyond its fun comic book plot. The origin is a satisfying and believable one, and once Batman finally enters the scene, the action is unmatched. Batman Begins is a strong, confident summer superhero blockbuster with more maturity and emotional truth than most dramas. I hesitate to call it the definitive interpretation of Batman (Batman 1989 takes that title), but Batman Begins is the best of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, a film that balances gritty realism, human drama, and thrilling comic book fun.85/100",8,27,29,10 September 2015
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Supremely Thrilling, Suspenseful, and Visually Breathtaking, The Lost World is a Summer Blockbuster Sequel Done Right
","The Lost World: Jurassic Park, the sequel to Steven Spielberg's iconic blockbuster, was released to massive commercial success, but critical disappointment. While audiences flocked to see the follow-up to the highest grossing movie of all-time, critics lambasted the movie for failing to live up to the high mark set by its groundbreaking predecessor. I'm here to set the record straight. The critics were demonstrably wrong. The Lost World is one of the most underrated, and over-hated movies of recent memory. Four years after Jurassic Park captivated audiences around the world, Steven Spielberg returned to the director's chair to craft a sequel that matched the original in every area that mattered. The Lost World is as technically accomplished, as thrilling, and as exquisitely crafted as the highly praised, Jurassic Park. Critics be damned!Michael Crichton's sequel novel serves as inspiration for The Lost World's story, which introduces Isla Sorna, or Site B, as its main setting. This island is the site where Jurassic Park's dinosaurs were bred and raised. After the events of Jurassic Park, the site was abandoned and dinosaurs roam free once again, in a proverbial 'lost world'. Ian Malcolm, the neurotic chaotician from the first film, is the centerpiece figure of The Lost World, substituting for Sam Neil's Alan Grant, who was left out of Crichton's book. Malcolm's girlfriend, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) and her team of biologists are sent to Isla Sorna to study the unique animals on the island. Meanwhile, InGen's team, led by great white hunter Roland Tembo, played with scene-stealing gusto by the late, great Pete Postlethwaite, come to capture some of the island's larger inhabitants. Ian Malcolm learns of this news and takes it upon himself to retrieve his girlfriend from the dinosaur-infested island. The Lost World doesn't bother much with exposition (After the pieces are put in place, it's non-stop dino-action), but David Koepp's script is not simple-minded. Here is a story that, in its own way, still develops its characters and encourages engagement. There are ideas present in The Lost World (on greed, nature, human hubris), which is more than you can say about its successors.One of the criticisms The Lost World often receives is that it lacks the compelling characters of the first film. It's a complaint that holds no water. Moore's wide-eyed, overly enthusiastic Dr. Harding, Vince Vaughn's militant eco-activist, Nick Van Owen, the aforementioned big game hunter, Tembo, and the rest of the new characters are, in the most basic sense, well drawn. What they lack in situational awareness (haters will have you know that there are dumb decisions made by some), they make up for in personality. Love them or hate them, these are real characters. People, with passions and flaws. Not the fleshy placeholders of JP3 and Jurassic World. And that's not to mention Jeff Goldblum, who carries the protagonist load admirably. When you think about it, his role here is not only different from the first film, but different from most anything Goldblum has done. We know he can do quirky, but his understated cynicism here comes off totally natural all the way through. Malcolm is the ultimate grounding force among all the dinosaur chaos; a huge asset to the movie.The cogent story and memorable characters, as welcome as they are, are only the icing on this cake. The essence of The Lost World is its fantastic dinosaur action. Here is where this movie outclasses nearly all its competitors. The Lost World is Steven Spielberg flexing his cinematic muscles. He takes the set pieces, a trailer dangling off a cliff, a basecamp ambush by territorial T-Rexes, or a raptor hunt in long grass, and weaves from them some real tension, suspense, and above all, thrills. Spielberg knows how to tease an action scene and have it explode to life at just the right time. Even when things move to San Diego in the final act, the richness of Spielberg's action remains. His sense for visual iconography, like glass slowly cracking, shadows streaking across tents, and trails being made in grass, is unparalleled. We've grown used to modern action that numbs the senses, but the satisfaction of Spielberg's action is that it enriches them. At this point, he's just showing off.But what is dinosaur action without the dinos themselves? If Jurassic Park redefined creature effects for the modern age, The Lost World perfected them. Combining the very best of both animatronics and digital effects, Stan Winston and ILM create dinosaurs even more dazzling than those in Jurassic Park. The intricately detailed large scale animatronics move smoothly with a wide range of motion, and the CGI is as photo real as anything in 1997, or today for that matter, but what separates these dinosaurs from other movie monsters is the way they are treated as characters. The dinosaurs of the Lost World: Jurassic Park are written and directed with a constant eye for realism. The T-Rex parents, the biggest stars of the film, don't chase and eat people just because they are T-Rexes. When they attack, we know why. They exhibit maternal instincts when their baby is taken from them and territorial instincts when the scientists venture too far into their domain (As do the stegosauruses, in a fabulous early scene). It is a credit to writer David Koepp that a film that could have easily devolved into mindless action maintains a certain level of intelligence, even in its most fantastic moments. And we aren't just told that the dinosaurs are 'animals, not monsters'. They actually behave that way. The T-Rexes sniff the air for signs of their baby, the raptors snap at each other during a hunt, the compys swarm a piece of food dropped on the beach; These moments feel like they were taken from a documentary. Of course this is how dinosaurs would behave. They are given reasons to roar and chase, when the lazy thing to do would be to create dinosaurs that exist only to look cool.Okay, so the story may not be as fresh as the original Jurassic Park, I can buy that, but The Lost World matches the first movie in nearly every other way. The special effects, action, score, set design, cinematography, you name it, they all carry the same mark of quality as the original Jurassic Park. There is passion behind the creation of The Lost World: Jurassic Park. A novel from Michael Crichton, Steven Spielberg at the helm, ILM and Stan Winston at the top of their respective games, and John Williams providing the music; This is the only Jurassic Park sequel that can stand with the original. It does exactly what a big budget sequel should do. It skips through the requisite set-up and launches full force into the thrills. The Lost World is jam-packed with jaw-dropping special effects and pulse-pounding action, yet it stays smart enough and scary enough to feel fulfilling. It's the very best kind of summer popcorn entertainment, and without question the best sequel to Jurassic Park.89/100",9,103,127,29 August 2015
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," In Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee Weaves Magic From Martial Arts
","Before Ang Lee's foray into Chinese martial arts movies, the Wuxia film genre had only enjoyed a small cult following in the West. With Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, it hit the mainstream. Steeped in the tradition of Wuxia, and fully celebratory of its genre's over-the-top conventions, Ang Lee's 2000 masterwork plays perfectly as an action-packed and rousing martial arts movie. That alone would be enough to champion this movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, Ang Lee and his collaborators have created something for which the word 'transcendent' is meant. Crouching Tiger mines from its pulp heritage, a type of metaphysical artistry. The action is not just exciting, it is endlessly and exquisitely creative. The scenery is not just pretty, it is otherworldly in its beauty. The characters and story are not just interesting, they are mesmerizingly spiritual.Crouching Tiger is a classic romantic adventure, and while I have little experience with Chinese martial arts cinema, I assume its story sticks closely to well worn genre traits. Based on a book by Wang DuLu, the story centers around two women, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), a veteran Wuxia warrior and Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) a princess who dreams of living free of her upper class life, and their respective loves, the master warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and the renegade outlaw 'Dark Cloud' (Chen Chang). In Jen's journey of self discovery, Li's philosophical meditation, and Yu Shu's liberating romance, the course is set for a sweeping, large-scale adventure. Crouching Tiger is exactly that; a rousing action fantasy full of fun and thrills. What's more is that it is also a stirring emotional experience. The three principle characters are effortlessly magnetic on screen. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh deliver the finest work of their careers here as lifelong friends and repressed lovers, and Zhang Ziyi is enchanting in the role that turned her into a Chinese sensation overnight. The story of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one that snuck up on me emotionally. There is a good deal of talky time spent discussing the plot of a stolen sword and a mysterious Jade Fox character, as well as a long flashback that apparently does little to forward the plot. The emotions are relatively understated for the first two-thirds of the movie, so when the character resolutions finally hit, they feel like body blows. The movie very subtly builds its themes and endears us to its characters. It is a remarkable feat of storytelling from scriptwriters Hui-Ling Wang, James Schamus and Kuo Jung Tsai.Perhaps the most remarkable of Crouching Tiger's many remarkable elements are its martial arts action scenes. Under Ang Lee's direction, Peter Pau's cinematography and Yeun Woo-Ping's sensational fight choreography are given an elegant, mystical energy. The action in Crouching Tiger resonates like nothing I've ever seen before. It is fast, inventive, and so ceaselessly exciting, that it becomes more than just action. There is something hypnotic about its juxtaposition of sublime craftsmanship and pulpy cheesiness. It's enough that the fight scenes are perfect from a technical standpoint, but the tone here strikes the perfect balance of camp, fun, and danger. I've seen a lot of great action movies. None of them left my jaw on the floor every time the swords clash. Crouching Tiger did.If story and action weren't enough, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon also excels in each and every one of the technical departments. The costumes, sets, and sound all radiate quality. The production values in Crouching Tiger are lightyears beyond its drive-in schlock cousins. Peter Pau's cinematography, which won him the most deserved Oscar in the history of the award, is a top-to-bottom perfect showcase of what a great cinematographer can do. Crouching Tiger is beyond beautiful to look at. The streets of Beijing, the vast Gobi desert, and the lush, green Bamboo forests are just a few of the standout locations in Crouching Tiger and Pau photographs them in a way that makes them feel like characters unto themselves.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an extraordinary piece of film. Plenty of movies claim to have 'something for everyone', but few are able to master dozens of elements the way Crouching Tiger does. This is one of the great art house films ever made and also one of the great action spectaculars. How delightfully crazy is that to think? What Ang Lee has done with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is create pure art from the basic elements of a genre mostly accepted as meaningless junk. It's miraculous. Any way you look at it, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is magical.96/100",10,0,0,31 July 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Kick Back, Relax, and Soak in the Splendor of Tarantino's Hollywood
","Of the handful of elite directors still working today (a number that has dwindled in the past two decades), Quentin Tarantino is the undisputed leader in 'cool'. He makes movies that sync to the movie geek's unexplored subconscious. Movies that can be both literate and silly, and can harmonize these opposing ideas into pristine cinematic art. Tarantino is a director who can make a woman's hanging feel poignant, or a monologue about Superman feel positively riveting. He specializes in creating the cinematic equivalents of adrenaline shots to the heart. His newest film, Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood, is not that type of 'cool'. It's not the thrilling, electro-charged, go-for-broke mad genius mayhem of Tarantino's best movies, but rather something quieter, more laid back, groovier.Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood doesn't necessarily have a plot. At least not the kind that moves linearly from beginning to end. The story roams around the events, people, and places involved in the Manson Family Murders of 1969, but we are privy to only glances. Our protagonists are aging leading man Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double and friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). It's hard to describe these characters' story in movie terms. The film follows them, but not through a journey or a mystery or a caper, but through their everyday life. Rick on the set of a western TV show, Cliff fixing a TV antenna while reminiscing about the time he challenged Bruce Lee to a fight. In actuality, the movie is almost entirely made up of such scenes. Interesting vignettes of Hollywood life.In the moment, these don't seem to have a purpose. I can imagine a lot of people (Tarantino fans included) thinking to themselves around the middle of the film, 'What's the point here?'. The thought never crossed my mind though because I was too busy admiring the craft. For starters, we have a trio of brilliant performances from three of our greatest modern movie stars. DiCaprio and Pitt, neither of whom I find to have upper echelon acting talent, are given roles that play directly to the strengths they do possess. DiCaprio has room to go way over the top playing an actor who is trying to literally act his way out of irrelevance. He has always had a tendency to overact, but it works for this character. The same goes for Pitt, who too often underacts. He is gifted here with a character whose steely, tough guy personality fits him like a glove. Pitt settles into a comfortable groove with Cliff, centered and in control at all times, while adding an unexpected warmth not often seen from this type of character or Pitt himself. It's his best performance in years. The third great performance comes from Margot Robbie, an emerging classic Hollywood starlet playing a classic Hollywood starlet who was robbed of her chance to emerge. Robbie in a small, but vital role, radiates with innocent charm. Her function in the film is as a monument to a lost time, place, and feeling. Her performance has to be bigger than reality. It is just that; an idolized tribute to aspiring actresses, and to a larger extent, the good vibes of the 60s.The other thing keeping the vignettes fresh is Tarantino's direction. He's always been a limber, creative filmmaker, not afraid to surprise the audience with something utterly unexpected. He plays with time, narration, and story structure with giddy enthusiasm and a straight face. This manifests itself in Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood through his delightfully stubborn insistence on letting entire scenes play out. We've been conditioned to expect a certain pace in our films. We expect to get the desired information, and move on. Trim the fat. This film is plenty fat. We don't get a glimpse of Rick Dalton's TV work. We get a full recreation of a 'Rifleman'-style shootout. We don't get one shot of Booth driving a Coupe Deville across the Sunset Strip, we get long, almost action-set-piece-y montages. Indulgent, yes, but endlessly watchable.Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood is among the least 'exciting' of Tarantino's work. It doesn't have the wild supercharged energy of Kill Bill or the thrilling character dynamics of The Hateful Eight, but that doesn't make it less of a film. And it's not to undersell this film's ending in which we are accosted by an explosion of violence so insane you can't help but cackle with glee. It's fifteen minutes of wacko brilliance. But for the most part, Tarantino's 9th picture is a mellow affair. A refreshing and wonderful elegy to a lost time. It's a collection of some of the best acted and directed scenes of the past five years. A much needed gift to those of us who still treasure good old-fashioned grown-up entertainment, with plenty to savor afterwards.91/100",9,17,33,3 August 2019
Get Out," Regressive Racial Politics Infect an Otherwise Interesting Horror Flick
","Get Out has proven without a shadow of doubt that in today's Hollywood, critical praise has less to do with traditional cinematic qualities like strength of story, richness of character, and technical craftsmanship, and more to do with a film's relative scale of 'wokeness'. The blackest, gayest, most leftist movie wins. Jordon Peele's directing debut hits high marks on the traditional criteria. It's a refreshingly original horror movie with some good performances, and it's staged well by the less funny half of the comedy group, Key and Peele. In a sane world, that would be all the movie is. But... and it's a big but, Get Out is a race movie. A race movie whose regressive views on black/white relations made it a sensation with critics, and a frustratingly divisive ordeal for me.The biggest strength Get Out has is that it is an original piece of work. Underneath all the flashy racial business dominating the conversation around the movie, is a very cool horror movie premise. A family kidnaps young, virile strangers in an attempt to ultimately live through their bodies. It's interesting as written, and when things heat up towards the end of this movie, it leads to some electrifying, sustained tension. I wish that that was all the story had on its mind, but it's not. No, the movie has to bring race into things. The evil family doesn't kidnap just any young, cool, or physically superior bodies. They only kidnap black people.The message of Get Out can be debated. Is it a critique on standard white racism or the subtle racism of white liberals? Who knows. I read it as the latter, but any way you look at it, Get Out ultimately concludes that 'Black people ought to be scared of white people'. And there lies the reason this very well done horror movie has to get a thumbs down from me. The portrayal of the relationship between black and white characters here is the dictionary definition of 'regressive'. Every black person in the movie is distrustful, and scared of white people, and the white people in the movie... well. The white people in this film are all irredeemably evil, which is deplorable in its own right, but Peele undercuts even his own metaphor by having them behave unlike any human who has ever lived. These are an alien's version of what evil white people are like. They gleefully discuss their love of black bodies (which nobody has ever done), and their dialogue is so tin-eared, performed with such rote formality that it's impossible to take them seriously as characters. They aren't characters. The white people in Get Out are evil aliens, every single one of them. Most troubling about this is that these are meant to be stand-ins for society at large. Jordan Peele wants to make a point that even though overt racism has settled down in modern society, subtle racism is worse than ever. It is a decidedly ugly view of people, one designed to stoke the flames of fear and distrust; to drive a massive wedge between whites and blacks until we share no common ground. When it is revealed that this evil white conspiracy stems from their jealousy of black people, I just about lost it. This has to be the most ass-backwards anti-racism movie ever made. It's not a call for understanding, it's a paranoid revenge fantasy, and it made me sick to my stomach. White people leave the theater hopeless (There is nothing they can do to redeem their evil ways. They just have to be killed), and black people leave the theater more fearful and distrustful of white people than when they walked in (Even the people who don't seem racist are out to get you). The racial politics of this movie are borderline reprehensible. For all Get Out has going for it, and that is a lot (Daniel Kaluuya delivers a great, subdued central performance, LilRel Howery provides some fun comic relief, and Jordon Peele keeps the tension high), it's all ruined by the very thing that is responsible for the movie's absurd critical fawning. What really sucks is that had this movie been a straightforward horror mystery, it would have really worked. The race angle, as it is, provides nothing of substance, and worse, it's malicious. What could have been a terrific horror flick is strangled to death by a message movie that actively preaches fear. Of course critics love it.35/100",3,167,292,3 March 2018
Drive," Muddy Neon Dreck, Drive is the Harbinger of Doom for Real Cinema.
","Drive is representative of an entire subset of movie that has wormed its way into popularity among film buffs. A harbinger really. I've taken to calling it the 'Instagram Filter Film'. Exercises in the style where 'style' is defined as a neon, washed out, out of focus Instagram filter over bland handheld camera work. The Instagram Filter Film also comes with dreary, meditative, vacuous electronic music and performances so subtle, so bereft of emotive risk, that the characters barely even speak at all. The Instagram Filter Film is king. Moonlight, Waves, Under the Skin, and countless other A24 darlings are routinely praised as masterpieces. Online, people frequently cite these films as their ALL-TIME favorite movies. I am baffled, downright perplexed by this sentiment.Why do people love Drive? It cannot be for the story, which follows Ryan Gosling as a stunt/getaway driver through the seedy L.A. crime scene in a series of drawn-out, boring jobs and stilted-beyond-comprehension conversations. The forward momentum of Drive's plot is broken beyond repair. Dialogue is delivered in long, slow, mumbly fragments. Characters are constantly pausing, staring, freezing in place for seconds at a time. It's a massive directorial failure, stabbing the movie in the jugular and watching the lifeblood pour out. This movie dares you not to fall asleep. People have the audacity to call this thing a thriller. I've seen more thrills in line at the DMV. There are some good actors here, but with the possible exception of Albert Brooks, they are zombies. Ryan Gosling is as bad as he's ever been. I have rarely seen a movie star of his caliber deliver as lazy a performance as this. He fights back against any semblance of human emotion. He's so hung up on being cool, that he forgets the part about acting like an actual human being. I think if director Nicolas Winding Refn had his way, he would have hired a wax statue of James Dean instead. That might have been an improvement.No, people love Drive, apparently, for its style. Because Drive is 'cool' and it looks 'cool', and it sounds 'cool' and the costumes are 'cool'. But is it? Refn is clearly obsessed with the superficial elements, at the expense of everything else. And that would be one thing if the superficial elements were interesting. They are not. The music is not my thing. Whatever, I won't hold that against it. But the look. I simply refuse to believe that a human person can prefer the look of Drive to ANYTHING. Pick any movie ever shot on honest-to-God celluloid and it looks clearly, obviously more pleasing to the eye than this dank, murky digital vomit. Seriously, think of the first movie that pops into your head... Good Will Hunting, Lawrence of Arabia, The Cider House flippin' Rules, all infinitely brighter, clearer, more colorful and alive. The mood of Drive is so turgid and mucky and off, I was repulsed by it.Now the real dilemma I have is that so many intelligent people had the direct opposite reaction. People LOVE this movie. They love the look, the mood, the stillness. It's at times like these when I feel like a Martian. I have no idea what people see in this movie, the same way I have no idea what people hear in mumble rap or taste in kale. Someone telling me they prefer Drive to thousands of other movies is like someone telling me they prefer their food rotten. It's literally unbelievable. I can't see the other side of the argument, sorry. To me, Drive is nothing but a boring, plodding, self-righteous, full-of-crap slog.23/100",2,2,4,25 February 2020
Frozen," Classic Disney at its Most Lifeless, Frozen is a Cold CGI Bore.
","Frozen, the 2013 Disney ultra-hit had been floating around my peripheries since it was released. I would hear the songs everywhere, my friends would talk about it, I would watch parts of it on various screens in various places. By the time I sat down to actually watch the thing from beginning to end, I had thought I knew what my opinion would be. Frozen seemed like a riff on the classic Disney princess formula, an upbeat fairy tale with colorful characters and great music. However, upon watching it closely for the first time, I quickly developed an overwhelmingly negative reaction.My dominating thought? Frozen should have been made using hand-drawn animation. Despite the movie's many strengths, I found this notion impossible to get past. Watching Frozen is a mildly enjoyable, but ultimately sterile experience. Against the memorable songs, the computer animation feels bland, uninspired, and, pardon the pun, cold.The story is indeed a riff on the Disney formula, with princesses and magical kingdoms and goofy sidekicks. It's formally efficient, not really much different in structure from any other Disney princess movie. Frozen leans towards some kind of girl empowerment message (which critics unsurprisingly blew out of proportion with transparent praise), but not in any way that Mulan or Princess and the Frog or Pocahontas didn't. And all three of those films are much better than Frozen. Why? Because they felt alive. The voice actors do their best to prop up the missing verve. Idina Menzel is a very good singer, she helps. Josh Gad has an amusing moment or two as Olaf. Kristen Bell, for her part, tries very hard, but her skittish modern girl act gets tiresome quick, and straight-up annoying the longer it goes.But it's not the story or the voice acting that makes Frozen feel dull. It's the animation. I have to preface my opinion by saying that I am open-minded about the strengths of CG animation. Obviously, it can be done tremendously well. It can work in tandem with the right story. Frozen is just not the right story. It is a classic Disney musical. It is crying out for classic Disney animation. It needs the warmth, personality, and texture of animation made by hand. Without that special touch, something feels 'off'. It is designed to look like an old-school cartoon, but it isn't one. The entire movie exists on an uneasy point between realism and idealism. Why try to awkwardly replicate an art style in the computer when the tools are there to do it for real?This is a topic that really winds me up. I don't think it's impossible to make a nostalgic Disney movie using CG animation. It can certainly be done (Frozen shows the difficulty inherent in trying, but nevertheless). What I stand passionately against, is the belief that CGI should replace an entire separate art form. There seems to be a common belief that hand-drawn animation or '2D animation' as some call it, is technically obsolete, like fax machines or paper maps. Or that it's too expensive, so it should be phased out of existence completely (The fact that Disney themselves have led this charge is doubly maddening). Traditional animation is an art form. Done well, it has the exact same appeal today as it did in 1937. The same way oil paintings can still be uniquely beautiful even after the invention of the photograph. But don't tell the animation studios this. They are content with throwing the entire medium in the trash, as if they simply cannot afford to scare audiences away with a 'dead' technology. But would Frozen have been any less of a box-office hit if it were frame by frame the same movie, only drawn by hand? Absolutely not. In fact, it'd almost certainly be a better film. A film with more personality and charm, with more energy and life.I totally resent people's compulsion to simply declare Frozen's animation 'beautiful' without any solid reasoning. What does 'beautiful' really mean? That the snow looks like real snow? That the ice shoots across the whole screen in elaborate patterns? What does the increased complexity of computer animation really add if it forsakes the important charms hand-drawn animation provides? For a movie like Frozen, the answer is, nothing.You're making a fairy tale. You need an artistic reason to animate it with computers. It can't be the standard. Frozen has no reason. It is technically proficient. You've got a story, characters, and music that basically work, but animation that does not. Just because CG animation exists, doesn't mean hand-drawn animation has to retire. In fact, if Frozen proves anything, it's that even some modern stories deserve the timeless personal touch of pencil on paper.42/100",4,2,4,19 November 2019
The Number 23," Jim Carrey Cannot Quite Breathe Life Into This Dopey Thriller
","The Number 23 is a psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher, and while the film contains an interesting premise and a juicy role for its star, it never coalesces into the taught adult entertainer it is trying to be.The story focuses on Jim Carrey's Walter Sparrow, a dog-catcher whose life is soon thrown into turmoil as he begins reading a book titled 'The Number 23'. The book seems to be based on his own life, and it details the seemingly supernatural aura surround the number 23. Through his reading, Walter begins to obsess over 23. The plot makes more than a few major leaps in logic in order to spice up Walter descent into madness. I won't say these logical forgivings are deal breakers. In fact, there are some neat ideas in The Number 23 (The hook about the titular number is at least mildly intriguing), but Schumacher and company don't do enough to mold these ideas into something entertaining.Jim Carey is the main attraction here, turning in a rare dramatic performance. Carrey has an excellent track record with dramatic material (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), but here the focus of those three wonderful movies is not there. Walter as a character has no defining character traits beyond obsessive or psychotic. Carrey tries his best to energize the role, and he is the most interesting part of the film, but his performance is really nothing special and it certainly doesn't make the plot any less silly.I think Joel Schumacher is often unfairly criticized for directing the worst film interpretation of one of the most popular superheroes ever. Schumacher is a competent director and he can (and has) done great things when paired with good material. In The Number 23, he is lost. This film treads just too close to Lifetime movie territory. The emotional beats never quite hit, the story is clumsy, and the characters are foggy archetypes. The Number 23 has an interesting Jim Carrey performance and it made me look at 23 in a new way (which is something), but there is not much to recommend with this messy thriller.35/100",3,1,3,18 March 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Dead Men Tell No Tales Botches the Attempt to Recapture Pirates Magic
","I walked out of the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales, deflated. I did not expect the movie to stand toe-to-toe with Gore Verbinski's trilogy, but my hopes were high for something of a return to what made the series such a big hit in the 2000s. Dead Men Tell No Tales does try to rekindle some impression of the classic trilogy, but it trips up areas that every other chapter thrived in. The new directors, Joachim R√∏nning and Espen Sandberg, bring daffy energy to the film, but fumble the action set-pieces the series is known for. The new villains are inspired, but the old hero is botched. The script revives lingering plot threads, but doesn't understand why droves of people fell in love with the series to begin with. I'm such a big fan of this series' brand of swashbuckling adventure that I was willing to forgive plenty of the film's many clunky creative decisions, but by the end of Pirates 5, I left feeling that maybe dead men are better off telling no tales at all.Unlike On Stranger Tides, which took pains to separate itself from Verbinski Trilogy, Dead Men Tell No Tales tries to plug back into the history of the first three films. The driving force of the plot is Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) who must locate The Trident of Poseidon to free his father from the Flying Dutchman. Suffice to say, each camp, including Captain Jack's gang and Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar and his frightening ghost crew, want the trident for their own reasons. Salazar is after Jack Sparrow (AKA 'Jas-berrrrow') for revenge after Sparrow killed his entire crew in a battle at sea. That battle is recalled in a neat flashback scene starring a convincingly de-aged Johnny Depp. For what it's worth, the new curses and myths within the story seem like they come from the same DNA as Pirates 1-3.Some characters also return from At World's End, but let's not pretend that means anything. It's just nice to see familiar faces. The new faces, as was the case in On Stranger Tides, are dull. Henry serves his purpose and connects the film to the earlier Pirates films, and Bardem's Salazar is a frightening villain, well designed and creepy. But on the other end of the spectrum is Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), an astronomer who holds the key to the location of this trident everyone is talking about. She is a black spot on the cast; a blatant attempt at cashing in on the 'strong, independent woman' trend. She's a girl-power gimmick. I hated her in her first half minute on screen, and things never got better. The good news is, she gets lost among the droning staleness of the rest of the large cast. And what about the man of the hour, ol' Captain Jack? How does Johnny Depp fare in this fifth go around as Jack Sparrow? Badly, I'm afraid. Here's where things get ugly. Jack Sparrow, who for four movies added an eccentric spark to the series' adventures, now comes close to actually subtracting from the story. Where Captain Jack was once a charismatic trickster, he is now a complete and utter buffoon. Johnny Depp plays Jack drunker, higher-pitched, and leagues dumber than ever before. It's like the original, Oscar-nominated Jack Sparrow got kicked in the head by a horse. I can blame Depp for a lot of the problems with Jack Sparrow, but it's certainly not his fault that every situation he finds himself in is written for laughs. 'Dead Men' is the first Pirates movie without writers Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott, and I believe the script is worse for it. Jeff Nathanson doesn't seem to understand how to use Jack Sparrow. He worked so well in the first three movies because he was a lovable scoundrel; charismatic and unpredictable, yes, but always a step ahead of the game. Captain Jack was a clever son-of-a-gun, not a clown. In Dead Men Tell No Tales, his dial is perpetually set to 'goofball'. Yeah, he's funny, and Depp is a fine comedic actor, but Jack Sparrow is one of the most iconic characters in cinema history for reasons beyond conjuring laughs.The directors Sandberg and R√∏nning are not in the same class as the swashbuckling maestro Gore Verbinski. They even struggle to match Rob Marshall's average work in On Stranger Tides. At least Marshall kept things clean. Sandberg and R√∏nning do a sloppy job with the big set-pieces. There are moments of fun on land or in the big ship vs ship battles, yet the action scenes often fall into traps that the franchise had managed to avoid for 14 years. Almost every action scene suffers from choppy editing, and there are times when the lighting gets so murky that scenes become incomprehensible. Rob Marshall's action scenes may have been tepid, but they were basically fun. The action scenes here are frustrating. A long, long way from the rousing excitement of the Verbinski movies.For Pirates fans like myself, Dead Men Tell No Tales promised a welcome bit of adventuring, with a story that returns to the same threads we left in 2007. It could have worked, but this movie has major problems, some of which teeter on fatal. Its too juvenile for its own good, Johnny Depp leans way too far into goofy slapstick, and the directors struggle to find their footing in this universe. I like adventure movies, and in these cynical times, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales does provide a wholesome (In a PG-13 sort of way) bout of summer escapism. Still, even for those of us who love this franchise, Pirates 5 made me wish these dead men would have stopped telling tales at 4.55/100",5,0,2,5 June 2017
1917," A Harrowing New Way to Experience The Horrors of War and the Thrills of Cinema.
","I hate the word 'gimmick' as it relates to filmmaking. Gimmick is an unconstructive word, something that can be tossed off to cheapen actual visions. 1917 is no 'gimmick movie'. It's an experimental grand slam that takes a chance on a unique visual structure and successfully moves cinema into new directions. The conversation around Sam Mendes' World War One drama has inevitably revolved around its audacious, single-shot framework. That technical feat is worth discussing. But so is the film itself and the way Sam Mendes weaves both camera and story together into a brilliant tapestry of beauty in the most hellish war ever fought.The bones of 1917 are familiar to those who have seen their share of war movies. It's World War One and there is a mission that has to be carried out. The British Army are preparing for an all out charge against the Germans. Little do they know, they are running into a trap. With communications down, two young soldiers, played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay, are dispatched into enemy lines to deliver the message to stand down. This type of story is not new territory for war movies. Saving Private Ryan chronicled a very similar mission, and Dunkirk involved similar themes of the affecting nature of battle. In the hands of a less capable, less creative director, 1917 might not do enough to separate itself from those towering films. That's where 1917's visual style comes into play. The movie is designed to look like one, continuous tracking shot. A gamble to be sure, but one that pays off.Cinematographer Roger Deakin's camera is 1917's ace in the hand. It moves fluidly through each set piece, keeping the action clear, informing key moments, and only drawing attention to itself when it should, in the grand emotional climaxes that litter the trek. That said, there are certain things you can't do as well with the one-take approach. It's harder to get those iconic, stand out images when the camera is so often in the same position; following the protagonists from behind or back tracking in front of them. Mendes can't as easily put the camera in interesting positions or angles when the characters have to be in frame 99% of the time. But what that apparent disadvantage does, is make the few memorable images there are, such as a cherry blossom 'snowfall' or a ruined town lit completely by flare light, more special because they seem to spring organically from the world. We don't have the expectation that we're going to see art, so when it's there, it stuns.The real advantage of the camera is in how it intensifies the pressure of the mission. Being so intimate with the characters makes the explosive beats shockingly effective. I jumped out of my seat on more than one occasion. Also, the movie takes place in real time, making the major point of tension, the countdown to the dawn attack, all the more impactful. Here, the passage of time isn't imagined through age old editing tricks, it's really there. From the first five minutes, we get a refreshing sense that this movie is going to provide feelings unlike any other war film. You're locked into the mission immediately. The clock starts ticking and the movie never lets you out of its grip until the very end.The reason this novel experimentation never wears thin is because underneath the visceral excitement it creates is a major emotional ride. Chapman and MacKay are a solid step above the average young British actor, exhibiting welcome restraint in moments that could slide into melodrama. Thomas Newman's rousing score does most of the heavy lifting in that department, but the balance never tips to schmaltz. That is due to an authenticity rivaling Saving Private Ryan, the best ever cinematic approximation of war. The ubiquitous little physical details in the trenches and on the battlegrounds seem to inspire the actors. No one player feels out of place. There is an overwhelming sensation that this is what The Great War was like. The relative attention to realism, combined with thunderous sound design and real time tension, make for incredible immersion.To discuss this movie based on its cinematography alone, ignores how stunning the rest of the movie is, and the way every element works together. Forget the 'gimmick' talk. 1917 is simply a brilliant, harrowing war film. The most unforgettable image, MacKay's character sprinting through the battlefield, with mortars exploding around him and hundreds of soldiers charging forward into certain death, is momentous not because of what the camera is doing, but because we were there with him in every moment leading up to it, and we feel its significance in the story. See 1917 for its exhilaration, its horror, and its beauty. There's no other film quite like it.92/100",9,7,10,13 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Neither Great, Nor Terrible, The Last Jedi is Oddly Anti-Star Wars
","I have written about my absolute disdain for Disney's Star Wars on the basis that I find it immoral to highjack an author's story for the purpose of building a brand. There is no getting around that. But I'm open to viewing Disney's fan-fiction as just that. And there is nothing keeping me from judging them as films, and not personifications of corporate greed and creative bankruptcy. And so, I sought out The Last Jedi. What I found was a film that was neither the masterpiece some claimed it to be, nor the failure others did. Instead, Episode 8 left me feeling a dull indifference about a property I thought I loved. Much like the latest Pirates of the Caribbean misfire, I walked out wondering if I actually did love Lucas' movies. Because The Last Jedi is prefixed, 'Star Wars', and it does follow familiar characters, but it felt alien. Like it was trying not to be Star Wars with the same transparent effort that The Force Awakens had trying to imitate it.I don't find the story worth discussing in detail. This is, after all, written and directed by a Star Wars fan, not its creator, but I'll give an overview. So the Rebellion 2.0 is running from the Empire 2.0 while Luke, Han, and Leia 2.0 learn to bad together for the common good. That's the formulaic stuff. But The Last Jedi is not simply a retread of the original trilogy. The most interesting thread comes from Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren as a triangle of force users, each trying to pull another to their side of the force. There is a lot of philosophy about the shades of morality, about the power of hope, about self-validation, hubris, religion, and more packed into this plot. Not to mention the secrets haunting their pasts. It is unexpectedly thought-provoking material to come out of a Star Wars movie. On the other side is the main thrust of the picture, a low speed chase between the Empire and Rebellion 2.0. Here we have large chunks of story time devoted to getting away from a Star Destroyer. No political intrigue, no mysteries, no creation of lore, not much drama at all. Only a throwaway casino detour to mix things up. It's almost shockingly low in stakes and small in scale. The thing is, even though one storyline is interesting and the other isn't, neither comes from the same DNA as Lucas' Star Wars. And that's not a good thing.The problems I have with Episode 8 are not the micro-complaints that some Youtubers have peddled. I don't care about plot holes. I don't care about space physics. I don't care about fan theories that didn't come to pass. Honestly, I don't mind big issues like the way Luke's character is handled or the liberties Rian Johnson takes with the Force. I took almost every internet complaint in stride. The issues I have are macro. The tone, the essence, the feeling of The Last Jedi. This is a heavy, serious, philosophical, artsy science fiction film. Heavy, serious, philosophical, artsy science fiction is great. Heavy, serious, philosophical, artsy science fiction pretending to be a chapter of the Star Wars Saga just feels wrong. Star Wars is George Lucas' creation. It's rooted in child-like na√Øvet√©. An archetypal myth wrapped in earnest Saturday matinee fun. Its 'feeling' is shaped by the bits and pieces of George Lucas' cinematic inspirations (Kurosawa, John Ford, Flash Gordon), as well as the special quirks of his mind (A goofy sense of humor and an ear for silly dialogue). Rian Johnson doesn't have this. He has his own stylistic impulses, his own inspirations, his own 'feeling'. Great. But his movie claims to be part of Star Wars. You can't have your cake and eat it too.This is where we run into an argument I have made before. Franchise movies that are labelled 'More than...' are usually 'less than'. 'Casino Royale is more than a James Bond film', 'The Dark Knight is more than a Batman movie', 'The Last Jedi is more than a Star Wars movie'. The conceit is that a genre film that is serious or grounded is better than one that stays within the framework. I think the opposite is true. The best James Bond film is the one that uses the formula best, not the one that strays farthest from it. And so the best Star Wars movie is the one that most successfully captures the magic of the series (I'd say Episodes 1-6 all do a good job of this). Episode 7, as deplorable as it is, at least made the attempt. Rian Johnson's film proudly tries to be 'more than' a broad, kid-friendly myth. It goes for textured characters, and subtle allegory. It's less space opera than space art house. If it was its own thing, and if it dropped the awkward cutesy comedy shoehorned in, it might be great. However, when you call your film, 'Star Wars - Episode 8', you enter into a contract with the audience. You have a responsibility to justify your film as a part of the same fictional universe. On that front, The Last Jedi fails. For all its directorial flair, world class special effects, action, set and creature design, the movie doesn't work like it should.When I walk into a Star Wars film, even a Star Wars fan-fiction film, I want to be swept up by bold visual storytelling. I want to enjoy a story that nestles big themes in a bright, fun, adventurous exterior. The Last Jedi kind of resembles a Star Wars movie (space battles, lightsabers, and all that), but it feels anti-Star Wars. It's strange to complain about subtly drawn characters or nuanced themes about letting go of the past, but plopping those things into a Star Wars movie is odd and misguided. The more Disney fan-fiction that comes out, and the more it strays from the special Lucasian quirks, the faster the magic fades. Star Wars was a special Hollywood outlier; an original, independently made, unique piece of modern myth. Disney seems to want to ignore this. They want to treat Star Wars as a genre itself. A universe where directors can play around as they like. I say, if you are really interested in letting directors do their thing, then let them create their own universes. The Last Jedi has plenty to admire, some to enjoy, but nothing to justify that lofty title.59/100",5,4,6,29 March 2019
Jurassic World," Spielberg Magic, This Is Not. Still, a Visit to Jurassic World Is Worth the Price of Admission.
","You may have heard some critics champion Jurassic World as 'The best Jurassic Park sequel', some fans declare that it 'brought them back to their childhood', and others who may have made the absurd claim, 'It's better than the original'. Don't believe the hype. Jurassic World is nowhere close to the best Jurassic Park sequel (Spielberg's own, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, will always have that title). It is not going to bring you back to your childhood, and it doesn't hold a candle to what Steven Spielberg and crew accomplished with the original Jurassic Park. That being said, in a time of dark, self-serious, and pretentious blockbusters such as last year's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films, Jurassic World is a refreshing antidote. Light, wholesome, and heavy on adventure, JW harkens back to the big Hollywood 'event' blockbusters of the 80s and 90s. Let's just not pretend this is anything groundbreaking. The fourth Jurassic Park movie remembers to have fun with its premise, but Spielberg's magic touch is still sorely missed.Jurassic World is the latest film in the Jurassic Park franchise in name only. Call it a sequel, reboot, or re-quel, the fact remains, this is not the same world created by author Michael Crichton and made real by Spielberg and company in 1993. All the major characters from the first three films are gone. Alan Grant, Ellie Satler, Ian Malcolm, and the rest of the appealing and memorable characters of the earlier movies are replaced with broad movie archetypes and superfluous supporting characters. With respect to our new kid characters and Vincent D'Onofrio's bone-headed military grunt, the only two characters worth noting in Jurassic World are Owen Grady, a rugged dino-expert played by bona fide movie star Chris Pratt, and Claire Dearing, an uptight scientist played by Bryce Dallas-Howard. Both are really likable in doses, and the script doesn't subject us to too much of their dopey bantering. While Owen and Claire are cliched, and ultimately uninteresting, as characters, the charm and sheer star power of Pratt and Dallas-Howard are quite enough to bolster JW's brand of disposable summer adventuring.There's a neat little hook to the story of Jurassic World. After a re-branding of sorts, John Hammond's dream is finally realized and Jurassic Park is opened and fully operating. However, when the public begins to lose interest in seeing the same old dinosaurs, the scientists of Jurassic World are prompted to create an all-new hybrid dinosaur called the Indominus Rex. Well, you guessed it, that dinosaur escapes. Okay, so that's a clever solution to the classic Jurassic Park sequel dilemma, 'How does this stuff keep happening?', but that plot line takes all of twenty minutes to peter into a chase picture, and a simple one at that. The few subplots are banal. Be it, two brothers who come to Jurassic World to spend time with their aunt, or a ridiculous plan to weaponize velociraptors (The latter of those subplots is one of the most embarrassingly stupid ideas I've seen in a movie in years), Jurassic World doesn't have much to get invested in besides big scary monsters running after people.There is one aspect of the film that I love, and that is the design of the Jurassic World Resort. The care that went into perfecting the look of the theme park is a great deal higher than the care that went into the story or the filmmaking. Jurassic World is a living, breathing place, and it is filled with all kinds of minor details that help sell the illusion. The triceratops petting zoo, the hamster ball ride, the souvenir shops, and scores of other theme park related details are touches that I was grateful made it into the film. There are more than a few nice moments where you get to enjoy the park as it was 'intended'. The immersion lasts throughout, even as the prehistoric psycho-killer, and all the destruction that it brings, takes center stage. Once the Indominus Rex gets out, and all Hell breaks loose, director Colin Trevorrow's filmmaking starts to show its deficiencies. Jurassic World is an impressive technical feat. The action is staged well, and the special effects and production designs are incredibly polished. It all looks like a million bucks (or 150 million to be exact), and it's all very fun, but when it comes to the meat of the movie, it's foolish to think that Jurassic World is anything more than Transformers with dinosaurs. In Jurassic Park and The Lost World, Steven Spielberg infused his action scenes with tension and suspense. There was a certain kind of visual poetry to the T-Rex attack in the first movie or the raptors in the grass scene from The Lost World. They were exhilarating because of their selective restraint. Without showing everything, Spielberg made scenes that were subtle and scary, and that exploded to life at just the right moments. Jurassic World's action scenes are big, loud, and entertaining, but it's all chaos, no technique. Trevorrow throws the kitchen sink into every shot. The Indominus Rex chomps up dozens of machine gun toting mercenaries, pterodactyls dart all over the screen pecking and biting everything in sight, and big, lumbering CGI beasts fight each other and destroy every last peanut brittle building around them. Sound familiar? It's the kind of Call of Duty-esque sensory bombardment that can be loads of fun to watch while you're there but doesn't leave the lasting impact of truly great action.So it is with Jurassic World. The movie is big, bright, and fun, with lots of action and good special effects. It pleases crowds. But as with most big budget crowd pleasers, it comes with dull characters, brain dead plotting and booming CGI overload. Jurassic World left me with the exact same feeling I got after seeing Jurassic Park 3. Both movies are serviceable summer romps, full of dino-action and great visual effects, but there is simply a noticeable dip in the quality of the production. Jurassic World successfully mines from the franchise name a good B-caliber FX spectacular. For dumb summer fun, it works. But there was a time when Jurassic Park aspired to more than dumb summer fun. Steven Spielberg's first two movies had class. They grappled with ideas, they were intelligent, they showcased real filmmaking, and they were genuinely thrilling. Jurassic World is colorful and entertaining, but let's be clear, when it's all said and done, nothing beats Spielberg. 74/100",7,68,93,12 June 2018
Avatar," Avatar is James Cameron's Magnum Opus. A Revolutionarily Immersive, Awe-Inspiring Science Fiction Epic.
","James Cameron is a force of nature. His movies have an all-encompassing, ambient power of their own. The kind of power that makes a James Cameron movie a bigger deal than everything else. Avatar is his biggest yet. Every Cameron trope is out in full force: Bad-ass chicks, space marines, over-the-top action, and a sweeping love story. Avatar is in many ways an amalgamation of everything that makes James Cameron a unique voice in Hollywood. Elements of Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, True Lies, and Titanic are distilled here into a visionary masterwork of classic epic filmmaking and cutting-edge technology.Avatar's ambitious story follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) as he travels to the rainforest planet of Pandora to replace his late brother in the Avatar program, which allows certain humans to inhabit a body that resembles that of Pandora's native humanoids, the Na'vi. The leader of the program, Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), hopes to use avatars to peacefully interact with the natives. Meanwhile, others, including the greedy CEO, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) and the military leader, Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) look to exploit the Na'vi for a precious resource called unobtanium. Jake Sully is caught between these two worlds when he meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a blue-skinned Pocahontas who introduces him to her culture.Jake's inner conflict drives Avatar's story, and structurally, it works. Yes, it borrows a lot from Dances with Wolves. Learning from and becoming part of another culture is nothing new, but Avatar presents this classic tale in a fresh way. As a paraplegic, Sully's avatar allows him freedom. It gives him a genuine reason to view Na'vi life as an opportunity to start anew. I can buy it. And once the two sides of him finally clash, the power of that conflict really hits. It's a tangibly large story. Epic and engrossing. The effectiveness of that simple story, well told, of connecting with your supposed enemies is why I resent the disingenuous love story Cameron decided to put front and center.Before I get to the lavish praise of Avatar, which I consider one of the most special movie experiences of the century, I must address my one nagging grievance. The love story, the Neytiri character, and all the preachy 'bio-spiritual' fluff that comes with her, irked me. James Cameron has never been known for subtle characters, and Avatar doesn't change that. Dr. Augustine is a tough-talking scientist with a penchant for cigarettes, Colonel Quaritch is a hard-as-steel military grunt with a giant scar across his face, and the CEO practices golf in his office. The point is, these are bold-faced archetypes. Neytiri is no different. She's a tree-hugging, flower-power philosopher. That's fine, but Zoe Saldana's performance has none of Stephen Lang's towering vitality or Weaver's cool confidence. It's all screeching and posturing. She's shrill and angry, and her spirituality quickly devolves into a full-on castigation of the evils of military conquest and deforestation. Shouldn't this spiritual guide be a little more even-keeled? I never believed that Jake would fall for her. Compared to Cameron's other movie romance, Titanic, Avatar seems manufactured. Neytiri is less a character than she is a face on which to pin the movie's heavy-handed message.With that out of the way, let's get to what makes Avatar the single most monumental cinematic achievement of this generation. James Cameron creates, in Pandora, the most rich, realistic, and fully realized fictional world in the history of cinema. From a design standpoint alone, the imagination ingrained in the animals, plants, and vehicles is absolutely staggering. Pandora is miles ahead of everything else in terms of diversity of life, and what's really astounding is that with all these varied alien elements, Cameron somehow makes this place real. From the high-tech, lived-in military bases to the elaborate Na'vi culture, with its palpable sense of history, Cameron's attention to detail in Avatar is revolutionary.So too are his technical innovations. The movie is remembered most for it's pioneering use of 3D, and rightfully so. Implemented alongside the uncanny photo-realism of the Na'vi's, the creatures, the mountain-sized trees, and the bio-luminous plants, the 3D is more transporting than anything I have ever seen. All the superlatives in the world can't completely do justice to the Weta team that brought Cameron's gargantuan vision to reality, so I won't bother. The truly commendable aspect of Avatar is not that the special effects are so sophisticated, but that you forget that what you are watching are indeed special effects. Avatar uses 3D to immerse rather than amuse. You are absorbed in the world of Pandora so completely, that it cuts across the divide we have with most films. You don't watch Avatar, you live it, feel it, experience it.That feeling of absolute immersion is what defines Avatar. It's a movie, with plot, characters, and a story, but that stuff doesn't matter as much as the physical sensation it creates of actually being in a brand-new world. It's true, Jake Sully is less important than Pandora. But those who dismiss Avatar as simply 'pretty pictures' are undervaluing the impact of James Cameron's image-making. Avatar creates visuals and utilizes technology so well, it makes the audience feel like part of the film. Some people take for granted just how significant that is. Others take for granted James Cameron's direction. Here is the single most ambitious movie ever conceived, and Cameron handles it all with the confidence of a world-class chef. This guy is not intimidated by anything. He is an elite director; the world's leader in action and world-building, and miraculously, he keeps getting better! Avatar is his most accomplished film.Avatar's success lies in its ability to engross every kind of moviegoer. Science fiction geeks and action aficionados can revel in some of the most thrilling action scenes ever put to film (The final battle alone is more exciting than 99% of blockbusters before or since), sentimental romantics can connect to the classic story, and even those who don't connect to either can experience the once-in-a-lifetime thrill of visiting Pandora. James Cameron has made a picture that defies comparison. There is not another movie that reverberates with the ethereal power of Avatar. Because Avatar is beyond movies. The film is overwhelming; An event imagined and shot on a scale bigger and bolder than anything I've seen. Assisted by James Horner's majestic score and Mauro Fiore's epic cinematography, Avatar totally envelopes us in an exotic world. An original masterwork of popular entertainment, Avatar deserves its spot as the biggest hit in movie history. This is truly Cameron's magnum opus, a movie that burns with boundless passion. A classic that thrills as it inspires awe.93/100",9,11,15,21 January 2017
War of the Worlds," Powerful And Frightening. War Of The Worlds Is A Disaster Movie Of The Highest Caliber.
","Steven Spielberg's adaptation of H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds is another home run for the king of the blockbusters. It's big, expensive, and action- packed, but with an overarching sense of terror and real world panic, War of the Worlds succeeds where most alien invasion/disaster movies fail. It is genuinely frightening. I can enjoy lighter disaster fare like 2012 and Independence Day because seeing things get blown up can always provide for some amount of fun, but War of the Worlds is no Independence Day, and that's a very good thing. As an alien invasion story, War of the Worlds doesn't play the conflict up for cheap thrills and fun. It plays it straight, focusing for the first time on the serious real-world implications of such an invasion. Tom Cruise stars as a deadbeat dad named Ray Ferrier who is called on to watch his kids, a young daughter played by Dakota Fanning, and a teenage son played by Justin Chatwin, for the weekend. Their world is thrown into chaos when a bloodthirsty alien race ascends from the ground beneath them and invades Earth. The majority of the film shows the family trying to seek refuge among the millions of panicked New Englanders as the alien tripods attempt to exterminate the human race. While the plot is pretty straightforward, the real meat of the story is in seeing how the invasion affects the humans. Between the action, writers David Koepp and Josh Friedman punctuate the story with personal scenes detailing the toll that these events are taking on Ray and his family, as well as the general public. Koepp and Friedman are less concerned with plot and more concerned with character. One scene in particular sees the Ferriers driving through a crowd of desperate, cold, panicked people. Having the only working car in the area, they are targeted by a man with a gun. Without giving too much away, the dispute demonstrates the collective fear that an alien invasion might instill in real life. It is a powerful scene. These personal moments are plentiful and they give the film a sense of weight that is unheard of for similar summer blockbusters. Spielberg handles the human drama delicately and deftly and Cruise holds it all together with an intense and surprisingly heartfelt lead performance as a dad who will do anything to protect his kids.Of course, no alien invasion movie is complete without two things: Aliens, and scenes of invasion. This is where Steven Spielberg's direction dazzles. The aliens themselves, and their tripod vehicles, are not only extremely convincing special effects, they are utterly chilling characters. Spielberg and Koepp sensibly leave us in the dark when it comes to the aliens. We know what Ray knows; these things are not from Earth and they want to kill us. That is precisely the amount of information we need on these creatures in order to be afraid of them, and afraid I was.Spielberg got the aliens right, and the action right-er. The invasion set-pieces, which include the jaw-dropping initial attack, a sensational scene aboard a ferry, and an unbearably tense face off in Tim Robbins' fortified safehouse, are so effective in their sense of panic that they affected me on a physical level. These action scenes radiate with a primal kind of horror. Spielberg commands the screen. The man has a gift for rocking an audience, and what he does with the scenes of massive destruction is virtuosic. The big attack scenes are thrilling for sure, but the complete devotion to authenticity is what makes this stuff exceptional. Just look at Spielberg's staging; The ground-level compositions, the cutaways to panicked crowds, and the way the biggest explosions are shown away from the characters, sometimes fully in the background, make it seem as if the events are being captured on film in real time. It's a credit to the brilliance of Spielberg as a director that scenes of aliens vaporizing people can be utterly real and truly horrifying.That is by far the biggest strength of War of the Worlds. It is entertaining, we expect nothing less from Steven Spielberg, but it is much more than that. As a subtle allegory to post-9/11 America, it's brilliant. The story of a full-scale attack by a remorseless enemy was decidedly relevant back in 2005, and it's just as relevant today. War of the Worlds wisely sidesteps the issues of how the aliens got to Earth, what they want, and what the leaders of the world are doing to stop them. The story of War of the Worlds focuses on the everyday people and how these events affect them. The film is above all else, effective. Here is a film about panic that literally induces it. And as brilliantly realized as those sinister visitors from another world are, It's still the humans that make War of the Worlds profound.91/100",9,43,64,30 September 2015
All Quiet on the Western Front," More Than a History Lesson, All Quiet on the Western Front is a Powerful, Moving War Drama.
","The first silent film I ever watched was Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush, as part of a film class in college. I thought it worked well as an introduction to silent film, and as a way to convince steadfast casual viewers that very old movies can have just as much impact as anything today.Then I saw All Quiet on the Western Front.This is the film to show to people who refuse to touch anything made before 1985. It's not a movie to passively appreciate like so many other influential silent films, it's a movie that grabs you by the collar and forces you to stare at unthinkable tragedy. All Quiet on the Western Front is a war film as viscerally and emotionally powerful as any ever made.What impresses me most about All Quiet on the Western Front is its complete confidence. We may think of silent cinema as simplistic, juvenile even. Maybe it was more of a realm where filmmakers had to find their footing rather than show off their skill. And yet, as a piece of storytelling and as moving pictures, All Quiet on the Western Front is extremely assured. It has the David Lean-ian breadth of scope, the Spielberg-ian iconography (a masterful sequence follows a pair of boots' point of view through the war), and the kind of filmmaking craft that doesn't even seem possible from a movie made in 1929.All Quiet on the Western Front gives proper credit to the colossal bravery of WWI's soldiers, but it is emphatically anti-war. The miraculous thing about the film is that it earns every bit of its lofty message. Nowhere is that message better visualized than in the film's final images, of a butterfly, and of innocent faces that look directly at us, silently pleading to make it stop. Those final seconds, and the film as a whole is a burning reminder of the tragedy of war. If you only see one silent film in your life, this is the one.95/100",10,0,0,11 January 2020
Joker," For Comic Book Nerds, Joker is Surprising, New, and Daring. Film Fans Have Seen Much Better.
","Is it close-minded to say that comic book movies should stay in their lane? Most will say yes, and they will praise Joker for expanding the reach of superheroes even further into Hollywood's already saturated landscape. In one way, these people are right. Joker does barely qualify as a comic book movie. Batman and the Gotham City universe are relegated to the background, leaving in the foreground Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill clown who comes to slightly resemble The Clown Prince of Crime. If we have learned anything about comic books fans in the post-Avengers world, it's that they are very easily impressed. So used to their episodic bores they are, that anything that seems slightly more human or cerebral is celebrated as a revolutionary triumph. Joker is the latest comic book movie to get that treatment. From the director of The Hangover comes a movie starring everyone's favorite Batman villain in a capital F Film, that is most definitely not your average superhero movie. I don't see that as a positive. Joker tries very very hard to be a respected human character-piece. But because it strains in every moment to prove its worth as 'more than' a Batman movie, I couldn't embrace it.Joker is a protracted origin story for Batman's eventual arch-nemesis. It revolves around Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) a failed clown turned stand-up comedian who dreams of making it big. He is bullied and broken down by the system, leading to an eventual turn to evil. For all the 'discourse' (huge scare quotes around that word) surrounding the movie's stance on politics and culture, race and real world violence, Joker is not much more provocative than that. To talk about its deeper themes is useless, because the movie isn't even interested in that stuff. Joker kills some rich guys, he starts a wave of 'Rich Guys are Bad' sentiment, and eventually it leads to a small uprising. Along the way, writers Todd Phillips and Scott Silver sprinkle in some lines about mental illness that sound profound but go nowhere. It's as if the filmmakers figured the movie should have some serious themes, but weren't bothered to do the work. And I don't blame them. In fact, if I have a major complaint about the film, it's not that the movie wasn't serious enough, its that it takes itself way too seriously. Just be a comic book movie. If you want to be serious, takes your cues from The Killing Joke, not Taxi Driver. What's apparent all the way through Joker is the effort in which Todd Phillips tries to make this Gotham City 'real'. If you're so invested in making a Scorsese homage, drop the Batman mythos completely and call your movie 'Fleck'. The problem is, the movie has been a success because of the Batman mythos. I ask you then, why be so embarrassed by it? Make an honest-to-goodness Joker movie. It's the pretending to be 'above' comic books that bothers me.If you run down the technical qualities of Joker, you'll find things to admire. There are some interesting shots, some really gorgeous cinematography and production design showcasing a Gotham City that looks like the world's most beautiful garbage fire. There is a standard of quality here. The movie doesn't flat-out stink. That said, the script kind of does.But I digress. The only element I find worth discussing at any length is Joaquin Phoenix. He is a whole Hell of a lot of things in this movie, but most of all he is crazy watchable. Phoenix commits with everything he has to freakish physicality. He's got the rail thin body and the large, exaggerated movements of a silent era comedian. Then there's his laugh, uncontrolled and visibly painful. It is something to behold. Simply extremely admirable work from one of the most daring actors out there. The way he speaks dialogue though is a lot less admirable. Phoenix affects a weird child-like cadence that feels forced all the way through. He is going for creepy I suppose, but it comes off awkward. Still, he's in frame for almost the entirety of the movie, and because of him, you can't help but watch.I just don't see how anyone can walk out of this movie feeling energized by anything outside of the central performance and a few moments of violence. If the movie feigns in the direction of politics or mental illness, it certainly doesn't devote any energy to exploring them. There is far more attention given to the task of trying the shed the comic book image. Admittedly, the movie starts to get interesting in the last 15 minutes. Interesting enough to make you think at least. As patently ridiculous as the talk show scene is, as shoehorned in as some of the lines are, it ends with a genuinely provocative shock. But those final moments are an eleventh hour twist on what is basically a lame super villain origin story without any of the charms of a comic book.Comic book fans love darkness. In the world of superheroes, Darkness = Greatness. And Joker certainly is dark. It's the kind of thing tailored-made for comic bros who think The Dark Knight is the best movie of the century and Captain America: The Winter Soldier is some kind of monumental leap for cinema. But Joker is painfully transparent to the rest of us in its attempt to be edgy. I continue to implore comic book moviemakers to just play the material how it ought to be played. It's a lesson for every movie ever made, but one I think Todd Phillips really should have taken closer to heart. Joker strains hard for seriousness, desperately clinging to pseudo-profound dialogue, dirge-y strings on the soundtrack, and vacuous flirtations with topical issues. I didn't like it as a Batman-adjacent comic book movie because it constantly tries to push away from its source, and I didn't like it as a character-piece because it's too dependent on your familiarity with Batman's arch-nemesis. I like this movie ONLY as a showcase for Joaquin Phoenix to go absolutely mad with skinny underwear dancing and murder. I saw it, and I have no particular desire to ever think about it again.55/100",5,3,9,29 January 2020
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Coppola's Dracula Is An Atmospheric Masterpiece That Falls Just Short Of Greatness
","Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic vampire story is unlike any other film I have ever seen. A beautifully crafted Gothic horror romance, Bram Stoker's Dracula is infinitely rich in haunting atmosphere, but a conventional love story prevents it from becoming truly great.Bram Stoker's Dracula is a mostly faithful adaptation of the original novel, telling the story of Dracula's quest to find his long lost love through four characters, Keanu Reeves' lawyer Jonathan Harker, who experiences Dracula first-hand after being imprisoned in his castle, Harker's fianc√© Mina Murray played by Winona Ryder, the subject of Dracula's affection, Van Helsing the vampire hunter, played by Anthony Hopkins, and the man himself, Dracula, played with intensity by Gary Oldman. All four principle actors do well in their parts, lending a heightened drama to the fantastical story. Reeves is comfortably quiet as the straight man in the story. Ryder is an attractive presence on screen, wisely dialing back on the melodrama that may have infected her performance. Conversely, Anthony Hopkins gives a delightfully over-the-top turn as a man obsessed with killing Dracula. And speaking of the Count, Gary Oldman's irritating habit of wildly over-acting is actually channeled here into something incredibly watchable. Dracula is a fascinating presence every time he's on screen, especially when he's wearing Eiko Ishioka's brilliant costumes or sporting some of the most convincing creature makeup I have ever seen. The problem with the narrative in Bram Stoker's Dracula is that it spends too much time on an somewhat standard love story. Winona Ryder's character is well written and her arc works well enough, but at a certain point, the erotic love scenes only carry so much weight. I was far more interested in Dracula's point of view, and aesthetically, I simply wanted to spend more time in his castle. The first chunk of the film is so consistently engaging, both visually and thematically, that it is a pity that the rest of the movie never manages to get back to that level. I can't say I have a real problem with the love story. Like the rest of the film, it's well written, crafted, and acted, but the Dracula point of view as well as Van Helsing's vampire hunt were both more interesting story lines than the conventional love story, and I wish they would've gotten more screen time in comparison.Even with nagging problems regarding the story, I can't deny the power Coppola infuses into this film atmospherically. The costumes, music, sets, and special effects are uniformly amazing and they work together seamlessly with Coppola's direction to create a final product that is uniquely Coppola and uniquely Dracula. From the first shot of the film, Dracula is constantly surprising as a audio/visual experience. The first 45 minutes in particular showcase some of the most captivating visuals ever put on film. The opening flashback sequence alone is masterfully designed, composed, and shot. There is a heightened reality to the sequence, a storybook detachment that had me transfixed on the screen from the first second, and it didn't let up. The time spent in Dracula's castle is the highlight of the entire film, with the vast corridors of the castle illuminating with eerie shadows in some of the most daring and artistic cinematography I've ever seen. Dracula himself is a haunting creation, as he glides and coils about in an unsettlingly alien manner. The film never gets back to the same level of atmospheric intensity after we leave the castle, and that is a real shame, but still, Coppola continually shows us new visual tricks and inventive effects throughout the film. As a sensory experience, everything works. Coppola gives the film a breathtaking visual signature, utilizing age old camera tricks and special effects to create something that puts you in another world. It's not just unique locations we're treated to, it's a unique method of filmmaking. Wojciech Kilar's music is similarly special. Big, bold, haunting, and dramatic; the soundtrack here is exceptional. The same can be said for the costumes and makeup. There is a boldness to every technical department here.In Bram Stoker's Dracula, Francis Ford Coppola has created something daring, ambitious, and different in the best way possible. Unfortunately, the movie's best section is its first, and the story lingers too long on it's least interesting story line. While those complaints keep the film from being truly great, they don't stop Bram Stoker's Dracula from showcasing a master filmmaker's unique vision. This is a special film, an extraordinary sensory experience, a 2 hour journey to a dark, foreboding dreamworld that I won't soon forget.85/100",8,12,17,30 October 2016
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Drifting Further Away From The Charm Of The Original
","The Ice Age series is one of the more endearing animated franchise from the past decade. The first was a heartwarming and genuinely funny adventure taking place during the time of mammoths, sabertooth tigers, and clumsy sloths. The first sequel lost a lot of that magic, but Dawn of the Dinosaurs did do some fresh things with the series. However, generally, over time, the films have gained plenty of characters, but lost most of its charm. The fourth in the series, Continental Drift, is the least exciting, least funny, and cheapest of the bunch. That's not to say that Ice Age 4 doesn't have its moments: the main characters still have their appeal and there are a few good laughs, but it is clear that the Ice Age train is running out of steam here.Continental Drift kicks off with the lovable rodent Scrat causing the continents to drift apart. The trio of Manny, Diego, and Sid are soon embarking on an adventure adrift on the open sea. They meet up with pirates (and a whole collection of new characters) and try to find their way home. The plots of the Ice Age films have gotten simpler as they go, instead relying on introducing as many new characters as possible.The problem with Ice Age 4 is that none of the new characters are memorable, funny, or charming. The effort just seems to be down here. Ray Romano, Dennis Leary, and John Leguizamo, still manage to breath some life into the picture, but the passion is clearly not there like it was in 2002. The animation is also less-than-stellar. Ice Age Continental Drift could be a TV movie and I wouldn't know the difference. It's just cheap.There are some moments of wit and excitement in Ice Age 4, but on the whole, it is an exercise in diminishing returns. Most of the passion and effort of the series is gone, leading to a generic and, dare I say, boring animated adventure. Look elsewhere for family fun.42/100",4,9,9,13 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Epic, Emotional, and Powerful. George Lucas' Farewell to the Star Wars Saga is an Operatic Masterpiece of Blockbuster Cinema
","The final entry in George Lucas' Star Wars saga, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is one, giant climax to arguably the most popular movie franchise in history. It's also the most riveting of the series; A movie of such visual and storytelling intensity that it makes our typical standards for summer entertainment seem trivial. Sith has wall-to-wall action and jaw-dropping special effects, yes. By all measures, Episode III is a grand success when it comes to giving the legions of Star Wars fans any and everything they could have hoped for after Darth Vader uttered the words 'We meet again' in 1977. The beauty of Revenge of the Sith is that it earns much more than diverting summer thrills. Strip away all the baggage that comes with the name 'Star Wars' and what you are left with is one of the most enthralling films of 2005.Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith serves as a bridge to the first Star Wars, A New Hope, where we see the culmination of Anakin Skywalker's fall to the Dark Side. This is where Darth Vader is born. In addition to finally delivering on the promise of the entire prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith also has the gargantuan task of telling the story of how the Clone Wars ended, how an evil Empire emerged from a democratic Republic, and how Luke, Leia, Obi-Wan, and the rest found themselves where they are at the start of the original Star Wars movie. With all these massive story lines, it's a wonder that Lucas manages to squeeze the best out of every plot line, without straying from the film's most important element, Anakin's seduction by Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine. After having a vision of his wife, Padme, dying in childbirth, Jedi prodigy Anakin Skywalker consults with the chancellor, who expertly influences the young Jedi into turning to the dark side of the force. The entire seduction works brilliantly. With the seeds of Anakin's tragic flaw planted way back in The Phantom Menace, and expanded upon in Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith is free to focus on the straw that broke the camel's back. Anakin's desperation to save Padme's life makes his eventual turn believable, and Ian McDiarmid and Hayden Christensen both do well portraying an icy relationship that turns into a destructive mentorship. Anakin's final fall, framed alongside the rise of the Empire is a storytelling masterclass. Palpatine's seduction is subtle, yet dramatic, and the numerous loose ends from the originals are all tied with a certain kind of poetry. For all his writing deficiencies, Lucas spins this fable elegantly, with a delicacy that makes you realize, he's been dreaming of telling this story for a long, long time. The plot marches relentlessly forward with commanding momentum, but it is only one side of Revenge of the Sith. The special effects and action are in a class of their own. Episode III is the biggest of all the Star Wars movies in terms of story, and the visual effects return the favor. Once again, Lucas and company revel in all kinds of wide, sweeping shots of new worlds such as the lava fields of Mustafar or the city-sized sinkholes of Utapau. It's all part of a grand, dramatic style of filmmaking that makes Revenge of the Sith look like a finale, through and through. It's also remarkable how certain elements like the ships, soldiers, and costumes seamlessly blend into what is seen in the originals. As sophisticated as the effects are, its George Lucas and his painterly talent for composition that propel the effects from technically well done exercises of CGI and miniatures to truly beautiful cinematic images. Lost in all this is the action. The film begins with an old-fashioned space battle on an epic scale. It's a feast for the eyes, and it feels distinctly like classic Star Wars. The lightsaber duels, the lizard versus mono-wheel chase scene (which includes the villain General Grievous; a half droid, half alien, wheezing wonder of imagination and digital wizardry), and the Clone War battles are dazzling on levels rarely seen in traditional summer blockbusters. The final duel between Obi-Wan and a newly christened Darth Vader is operatic and straight-up Shakespearian in its emotional complexity. Along with the Order 66 montage, the action of the last half of Revenge of the Sith is as powerful as anything in the series.As with any movie, there are things in Episode III that could be criticized. The dialogue isn't dramatically better than it was in the previous two movies, and the acting can be wonky at times, but none of this amounts to anything in the grand scheme of things. In the end, Sith does so much right that complaining about a line or two that was corny or delivered awkwardly is an utter waste of time. The finale to the Star Wars saga aims so high and nails so many key notes, that its minor flaws are almost completely inconsequential. Revenge of the Sith is one of the boldest works of blockbuster filmmaking ever made. I can't name another tentpole franchise movie that comes close to the level of operatic emotional poignancy that marks the best moments of Episode III of the Star Wars Saga. Movies like this don't come around often. A New Hope is still the Star Wars movie we will cherish most, but in its boundless ambition and breathtaking power, Revenge of the Sith is high art in the form of a summer blockbuster. George Lucas puts every idea he's had about good vs evil, fathers and sons, and the rise and fall of empires into this masterpiece of popular entertainment. Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is a brilliantly crafted epic, one that cements George Lucas' Star Wars Saga as one of the great achievements in filmmaking history.92/100",9,192,224,19 December 2015
Finding Dory," Finding Dory, Losing Entertainment
","These days, it's too much to ask for a genuine Pixar gem. The glory days are long past. The creative fire that sustained the animation studio's best films is out. We won't get another Finding Nemo. But when an ill-gotten Nemo sequel comes along, is it too much to ask for something reasonably entertaining? Finding Dory retains the talent from the 2003 Pixar classic, but the 2016 sequel, like others before and after it, drops the passion. Sure, it's passably drawn, and it gave me some chuckles, but It's not as funny, not nearly as charming, and simply not as good as its predecessor.Finding Dory purports to have come from an original story by Nemo director Andrew Stanton, who also happens to have directed Dory. Honestly, I find the credit dubious. There's a good story here, but original? I don't know. In Finding Dory, a fish is taken off to a human world, other fish come to its aid, and things are wrapped up in an affirming message of love. This time, however, it's Dory that needs finding. Whatever, if Stanton wants to deliver the same beats in Nemo 2, that's all well and good by me. We know the story works. I'm just here for a good time, so shoot. Now if only Dory could have delivered the same personality, humor, or heart.Dory doesn't get those notes right. It's not a lack of effort, really. Finding Dory introduces new characters like Ed O'Neill's camouflaging octopus, Hank, and a whale shark voiced by Kaitlin Olson, but they are forgettable. It stages new escapes, but they aren't very exciting. There are new emotional beats featuring Dory and her parents, but they don't ring very true. The new elements of Finding Dory, as welcome as they are, are pale. With the exception of Ellen 'Why doesn't she do more movies' DeGeneres, the voice acting is lifeless, the character designs are obvious and kiddy, and the writing and direction seem flat out lazy. Case in point, the humor. I'll admit to chuckling one or two times during Finding Dory, but I never laughed. Half the jokes are recycled from Nemo, and the rest are uninspired guesses at what makes for good cartoon comedy. The reality is, I spent more time cringing than smiling. Why they decided to take a hilarious one-shot gag from Finding Nemo (Dory's whale speak) and stretch it out for an entire film, way past its breaking point, is beyond me. But it's not just the incessant whale noises that left me grinding my teeth. What about a wacky bird that exists solely to transport Marlin and Nemo around? Not funny, not memorable, not voiced by Geoffrey Rush.If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times, when the passion isn't there, the product suffers. Like Cars 2, Monster's University, and Incredibles 2, Finding Dory is good ole' apathetic Pixar. Not as shockingly Disney Junior-ish as Monsters U, Finding Dory doesn't quite qualify as a 'bad' Pixar movie. The animation is lovely to look at, and the settings are colorful and detailed. It's a nice little world they cooked up in this film, and I can't say I didn't enjoy being there. That said, there is a real lack of entertainment value in Finding Dory, which coasts along a familiar track while sloppily throwing together some 'funny' new characters, 'exciting' new situations, and a 'message' about family. I came into the movie with open arms. I had absolutely no expectations that it would approach Nemo's greatness. All I wanted was a fun afternoon at the movies. And still, I left Finding Dory in an indifferent funk.55/100",5,0,1,17 July 2019
The Terminal," The Art of Sincerity, Craft, and Optimism. The Terminal is a Delightful Grown-Up Crowdpleaser.
","Around film buff circles, the question of the best filmmakers alive seems to invariably lead to names like Nolan, Scorsese, Fincher. My answer is the same it's been since I was 8 years old. The 'corny', 'obvious', 'uncultured' pick; Steven Spielberg. When I posit Steven Spielberg as the greatest living director, there are plenty of films I could use for example. Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, E.T. But the one film I would choose for my thesis is 2004's The Terminal. Why does Spielberg's frothiest comedy prove him as the greatest filmmaker working? Because it illuminates pure directorial talent. When the subject is as inherently powerful as the horrors of warfare or the tolls of human suffering, you may not notice the quality of movie direction. If you really want to see why Spielberg is uncommonly skilled, you have to strip away the extra storytelling weapons. Take the mundanity of, say, an airport terminal, and watch how he makes it appear so magical, sparkling, and alive.The Terminal stars Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, a common traveler from the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia, who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. The place happens to be New York's JFK airport. The time? Smack dab in the middle of his country's civil war. Krakozhia is no longer, and little does Navorski know, he's legally trapped in the airport until the war ends. It's hard to describe the elevator pitch for The Terminal. It is based partially on a real life figure, but Spielberg takes the bones of that story to indulge in a Carpra-esque Hollywood entertainer. The Terminal is a lot of things, all of them delightful: a fish-out-of-water comedy, a crowd-pleasing romance, and a tear-jerking character piece. The dramatic pull of the film takes shape, we realize, in the form of Viktor Navorski's mission to get the autograph of a famous New York jazz musician. But that's not exactly what the movie is about.The story serves as an outlet for a collection of aforementioned fish-out-of-water scenes. Now would be a good time to highlight Hanks, who contributes heartily to the value of these scenes. Considering his talent as a dramatic actor, we tend to forget that he is one of the very best light comedians. Here he gets to go full Hanks ahead on the comedy. With his endearingly dorky Eastern European accent, Hanks delivers a winning one-man-show performance, pitched at just the right angle for the tone Spielberg is working with. Tom Hanks is someone who knows how to play broad without sacrificing sweetness.But more impressive than Hanks, or any of the other great supporting performances (Catherine Zeta-Jones reminds one of the classy Hollywood starlets of the 40s and 50s, and Stanley Tucci is an endlessly watchable baddie.) is Steven Spielberg's direction. He had an entire airport terminal set built specifically for this movie, and the way he populates, stages, and moves his camera around it, is deceptively virtuosic. Because again, nothing incredibly special happens within the terminal's confines. No more than a series of routines that we see through the puppy dog eyes of Hanks' character. And yet, every moment of The Terminal is invigorating. It's just light entertainment, but the way Spielberg carries us through it visually, it feels life-giving. There are shots here, of tiles on a bathroom wall, of tv monitors, or common bookstore facades that are as exciting as anything in Blade Runner 2049, Interstellar, or any other 'most beautiful movie ever'. There is a sequence where Navorski figures out how to acquire change to buy fast food, and it's electrifying. Others can try, but no one else can make that claim. Steven Spielberg could literally direct Hanks making a sandwich and I would be on the edge of my seat.The film is quite long. It would be unforgivably tedious and indulgent had it been directed by anyone else. But the greatest living director deserves to indulge. I could watch The Terminal for days. In all it's cheesy, earnest glory. It's a real delight. An old-fashioned crowd-pleaser that most people are scared to take a swing at in this century. Maybe that's because no one else has the directorial swagger of Steven Spielberg. Stripped of everything except a couple of great movie stars and a professional comedic screenplay, he shows how invaluable his cinematic instincts are. Airport Burger King has never looked so good.85/100",9,0,0,10 April 2020
Wonder Woman," Blunder Woman. This Critical Darling Is No More Than a Mediocre Superhero Origin.
","I wanted to like Wonder Woman. I thought I would like Wonder Woman. I had a sneaking suspicion that I might love Wonder Woman. Hey, critics practically fell over backwards praising the film as not only one of the greatest superhero movies ever made, but a historic step for womankind. And while I've learned in the last few years to not put too much stake into what critics say, even from the trailers, Wonder Woman looked appealing to me. I love DC Comics, I love old-fashioned adventures, and I love Greek Mythology and WW1 history. How could I not love Wonder Woman? Well, it's because Wonder Woman is not the masterpiece critics have anointed it as. It isn't even a success by the meager standards of modern superhero movies (it's been compared to The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2, when it is actually more like Green Lantern crossed with Thor). Wonder Woman is a bad movie. A standard, by-the-numbers superhero origin with dull characters, pointless action, and incomprehensible themes about the power of love (or something).Wonder Woman, as a character, does have one of the more interesting origin stories among DC superheroes. Steeped in Greek mythology and grand in scope, Wonder Woman's origins as a Greek demigod, modeled from clay by Hippolyta (played here by Connie Nielsen) and brought to life by Zeus on a hidden paradise called Themyscira, is perfect cinematic inspiration. It's no wonder then, that Wonder Woman's first twenty minutes are its best. The early scenes on Themyscira suffer from the same stilted dialogue and dubious acting of the rest of the film, but they are bright and colorful, and at that point in the film, the action is actually fun. The Greek mythology stuff is interesting, and while the first act is no home run, it's entertaining. When Chris Pine's Army pilot Steve Trevor shows up on the island, and the setting shifts to WWI-era Europe, Wonder Woman begins its long spiral downward, until the whole thing crashes to the bottom of the superhero barrel in the final act.Gal Gadot plays Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, and you've probably heard the praise. The role has launched her into stardom and granted her an almost God-like status among the select group of feminist superhero fans. You want the truth? In the role of Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot is... Well, she's got the build, she's got the looks, she has moments when her fish out of water schtick works, but she is barely an actress. The handful of moments when she has to get riled up and stand up for herself and her mission to kill Ares (the Greek God of War, assumed to be living as a German officer, for some reason) flop. I'm sure the devout feminist cult of Gal Gadot loved these moments, but to me, it seemed like Gadot could barely get the lines out correctly, much less give them any impact. Her struggle with English washes away any pretense of her as a genuine actress, and exposes the tall, Wonder-Woman-looking model underneath. She could have been much more annoying, but nevertheless, this is no 'great' performance.And speaking of overrated women involved with Wonder Woman. Director Patty Jenkins. She's female, and she directed a superhero movie. That seems to be enough for critics to elevate her to the highest level of the industry. Her exclusion from the Best Director Oscar nominations was considered a 'snub' by many. Puh. Lease. This is no great directing job. Let's look to the action scenes as an example. Early on, the action is kind of fun; staged competently, and bearing some creative and cool stunts. However, somewhere along the line you start to notice that these sequences are peppered, infected, overrun, with slow motion, bad CGI, and totally unearned grandiosity. Eventually, Wonder Woman absolutely devolves. Soon, it all becomes mindless, pointless, stupid, rubbery CGI crap. The final fight, without spoiling too much, sucks. And its monumental stupidity alone should have been enough for somebody, anybody, to give a negative review to this movie.But alas, critics ate this crap up. It would be baffling if I didn't know exactly why. Wonder Woman marketed itself as a feminist triumph before it was seen by anyone. A female-led superhero movie, directed by a female, with a message about female love and compassion conquering male aggression. No feminist worth their salt would dare speak ill of such a historic piece of entertainment. And no feminist did. Like Black Panther after it, critics interested in keeping their 'woke points' were held hostage by the hype. It doesn't matter if Gal Gadot can't act, or if all the secondary characters come off as cartoons, or if Patty Jenkins doesn't know how to handle action. It's a big-budget 'feminist' movie, so it is important. Therefore, no matter how bland, dull, tedious, and dumb Wonder Woman is, it was destined for great reviews. It will get no great review from me. I wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I have the guts to tell you, it's no good.39/100",3,13,21,26 June 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Big, Dramatic, and Action Packed, Batman v. Superman is Unapologetically Off-the-Wall
","Superman and Batman are my two favorite superheroes. I've always had a special affinity for their characters and an interest in their respective universes. As such, I awaited their first theatrical team-up like a kid on Christmas Eve. And like presents under the tree, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice is a colorful and exciting assortment, showcasing DC's most popular heroes in a big, bombastic romp that pinballs from character to character and plot line to plot line with reckless abandon. This movie is not a world-class lesson in narrative. However, as a fan of these characters, I was hooked the whole way through.It is understandable why the critics haven't been very kind to this film. It doesn't play by the rules. None of the characters are given enough time to be developed, there isn't a focused threat, and the story doesn't follow a linear path at all. Instead Batman v. Superman jumps from dramatic story lines to huge action scenes to personal character moments and writers David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio weave them all together with the grace of a bulldozer. When looking at it through a critic's lens, the movie doesn't hold up, but those with even a faint interest in the DC universe will not care in the slightest about the narrative clumsiness. I was consistently excited about the next big revelation or the next crazy action scene waiting just around the corner. The main thread of the story, if there is one, centers around Batman and Lex Luthor's respective quests to stop Superman, who has become a polarizing figure around the world, from turning on humanity. Of course there are plenty of side stories featuring Amy Adam's Lois Lane in a globe- trotting mystery, Holly Hunter as a Kentucky senator leading the trial against Superman, and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman as she pieces together the origins of the Justice League. The two titular characters may be controversial to some hardcore fans; This Batman is extremely brutal, and he even 'indirectly' kills with regularity. Superman doesn't fare much differently. He's a much more brooding character than some are used to, and the film plays up his God-like status a lot. While these aren't my ideal versions of the characters, I did enjoy seeing a slightly different take on them. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill do just fine in their roles, even though neither has enough screen time to truly develop. Affleck nails the tired, broken down Bruce Wayne, and Cavill is surprisingly effective in the few introspective moments he has. I can say definitively, both Batman and Superman pass this fan's eye test.Where this movie really shines however, is in the action and visuals. I was actually somewhat surprised that this film looked so good. I was not a fan of the cinematography in Man of Steel; with the extreme close-ups, shaky cam, and washed out color, it looked like a bad TV commercial. Visually, Zack Snyder and company take a giant leap forward in this sequel. Snyder's signature comic book style comes out in full force. The action scenes are beautifully shot, playing out like a series of full page splashes in motion. The titular battle in particular is absolutely jaw-dropping and worth the price of admission alone. In fact, the entire film is an audio visual feast, especially for comic book fans. The style Snyder infuses into every single frame makes it the most visually astounding comic book movie since Spider-Man 2. It's the type of epic, dynamic, at times stunning sensory experience that has made Zack Snyder a household name among blockbuster filmmakers. The rich, engaging visual flair also helps to differentiate the film from the bland, TV show look of Marvel's movies.In the end, Batman v. Superman is an absolute behemoth of a film. It throws the kitchen sink into everything for better or worse. On the one hand, the story is jam-packed with all kinds of subplots and secondary characters, to the point where the casual viewer may very well be completely lost by the end. On the other hand, the movie is dripping with style and action. I thoroughly enjoyed this beast of a film, and even though I still don't know how I feel about it's controversial ending, I have to recommend it. If you are a fan of DC's two most popular superheroes, you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot.82/100",8,62,106,8 April 2016
The Greatest Showman," Great Music and Likable Leads, but This Show Is Not the Greatest
","I will admit, I'm a sucker for movie musicals. Give me genial, upbeat stories set to catchy music and I'm willing to forgive a lot of flaws. Generally speaking, musicals are easy to enjoy, no matter who is behind the camera. The Greatest Showman, Hugh Jackman's musical biopic of circus pioneer P.T. Barnum, is indeed likable. Jackman makes a great ring leader, for the circus as well as the film, and the songs are undeniably appealing, but with banal, clich√©d, uninteresting stuff going on between the music, The Greatest Showman is barely worth the two-hour investment.The film is very light on story. The narrative is your standard biographical retelling of an unlikely rise to fame. In this case, it's P.T, Barnum, who had an interesting real life, but whose circus' rise to prominence is rendered pretty well drama-free, here. The Greatest Showman pays lip service to ideas of self-worth and confidence, and it admirably creates a sense of camaraderie among the circus' entertainers, but whatever interest I took in the story was fleeting. The manufactured conflicts, including an interracial love affair between Zac Efron and Zendaya's characters, or a sub-plot concerning circus protestors, wear thin as they go along. The best musicals not only have great music and colorful dance numbers but a powerful central narrative. That aspect is clearly lacking in this script.Despite feeling like an old-fashioned Hollywood musical, The Greatest Showman is actually rather unorthodox when it comes to its music. The songs are all modern pop, which is initially rather odd considering the film is set in the 19th Century, but before the first number was over, I had warmed to the notion. Now I don't consider myself a fan of modern pop music, but these songs impressed me. There's a brassy mix of acoustic and electronic to nearly every song, and as a result, they all sound kind of similar, but I couldn't help tapping my toes to most of them. These are great songs. If I had one complaint, it's that the best songs seem to be loaded at the front.There is a subset of 30-40-year-old women who will absolutely adore The Greatest Showman. It is rooted in classic Hollywood, with a charismatic lead actor, a feel-good story, and wholesome themes. Yet, it's hip enough in its music to feel fresh. For that subset and others, that is all they will see. They won't be bothered by the lack of a compelling narrative or the shopworn clich√©s about letting your freak flag fly. They won't mind the grinding pacing or the chopped-up dance numbers that never linger long enough. There is a lot you have to overlook in The Greatest Showman to really enjoy it, but it is possible.63/100",6,1,2,13 February 2019
Monsters University," Pixar Gets an F. The Juvenile Monster's U Shows Little Effort.
","We all know how unprecedentedly great Pixar was in the late-90s and early-2000s. With classic after classic after classic, the CG animation pioneers redefined family cinema. Then, around the turn of the decade, they ran out of ideas. Monster's University is another of their subpar sequels, and what a sad reminder this film is of those past glory days.Monster's university is technically a prequel to the fabulous 2001 film, Monster's Inc., showcasing Mike and Sully (voiced again by Billy Crystal and John Goodman) as newly acquainted college freshmen at a prestigious school for scaring. And now is where I ask, Who thought this story was worthy of a feature film? There is nothing of value to the whole premise, much less to the film's trite plot. The writers do their best to spice up the obligatory prequel features (callbacks, introductions to people we already know, and the like) with a manufactured 'College Games' that pits several fraternities against one another in a race for a school trophy, but it only serves to illuminate the lack of interest in revisiting Monster's Inc. It's also shamelessly kiddie. For a studio that made its name with storytelling strong enough for parents to enjoy, it's almost shocking to see something as trivial as a 'big game' as the movie's centerpiece. Monster's University's story barely qualifies as a Disney Junior Original, never mind a Pixar product.The downfall of Pixar is two-fold. In one sense, they have lost the creative spark that led to Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, straining to recreate their signature blend of smart storytelling, colorful characters, and creative animation. And then there's movies like Monster's University, which doesn't even try to imitate a formula that works. It's low hanging fruit to prop up a few mildly amusing gags on a paper-thin storyline about some manufactured college competition. Monster's University will distract kids, but it won't do much else. I did not hate the film, but I was thoroughly disappointed by it. At one time, you could count on the fact that Pixar would never play it safe. If Monster's U is any indication, those days are long gone.38/100",3,1,2,8 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Disney Sponsored Fan Fiction. The Force Awakens Is A Disgraceful Example Of Corporate Filmmaking.
","For those praising this film, Star Wars Episode 7 is a despicable corporate product of a movie, that leeches off the imagination of the man who created its universe, while simultaneously giving him a giant middle finger by erasing all remnants of his Prequel Trilogy and turning the franchise into a vehicle for pandering fan service and a 'progressive', feminist agenda. Episode 7 is nothing but glorified fan fiction made by a corporation desperate to get a return on their investment. With years of careful risk-benefit analysis, they were able to produce a film that upset the least amount of the rabid, vicious 'original fan base' as possible.So 'fans', you got everything you wanted. George Lucas, and the prequels are but a memory and you get all your original toys back, with just enough new crap to fool you into thinking your experiencing something fresh. You'll see the next 20 Star Wars movies and you'll get everything you begged to have, but you'll never be surprised. When Lucas wrote the script for A New Hope, he wasn't trying to please anyone but himself. He wasn't feeding a hungry mob everything they wanted, he was crafting a story that he wanted to see told on film. After 6 great chapters, he finished his story. So enjoy Disney's Star Wars movies until the end of time, but just remember that you're never going to see a film series so daring, ambitious, and above all, entertaining as George Lucas' Star Wars. Now, onto the aspects of this travesty that I fundamentally stand against.1. A Star Wars Movie Without George Lucas Is Not Star Wars<ul><li>George Lucas didn't just have a part in the making of Star Wars, he CREATED it. Star Wars wasn't a collaboration that incorporated the imaginations of many different people. It wasn't an adaptation of someone else's work. Star Wars is solely the product of one man's imagination. Sure, tons of people worked on the films, but the entire Star Wars universe is George Lucas' vision. The uniqueness of Star Wars is that it all comes from the mind of one, incredibly creative man. Episodes 1-6 are the official Star Wars story as told by the man who created it. Any other story is, by definition, an imitation. Lucasfilm can try all they like to make these new movies look and feel like the real deal, but the truth of the matter is, they will never be the genuine article. Lucas' quirky touch is what makes Star Wars special. Without it, it's just another disposable sci-fi franchise.</li></ul>2. Every Decision Was Made By A Corporation. <ul><li>The Force Awakens is a focus-grouped, market researched, PRODUCT that reeks of corporate control. After acquiring Lucasfilm, Disney had this film made so they would make their money back and then some. Storytelling was absolutely secondary. And the conception of the film isn't the only glaringly obvious corporate decision in Episode 7. EVERY major decision in the film was overseen by Disney and Lucasfilm. The new characters in particular reek of corporate greed and agenda pushing. The main character is a female and the secondary characters are mostly played by women or minorities. Disney will champion these casting decisions as a progressive triumph, but the truth of the matter is that these new characters exist purely as a PR move. Congratulations, your SJW street cred is through the roof, but I will never support a movie that uses someone else's creation as a platform to help their brand. </li></ul>3. It Panders To A Vocal Minority Of 'Fans'It absolutely sickens me that this movie deliberately ignores and actively mocks the prequels. George Lucas spent 10 years of his life crafting those films, and millions of people loved them, but the executives at Lucasfilm and Disney were so afraid of the pathetic internet trolls that they became one themselves. All the marketing of 'The movie you've been waiting for since 1983!', 'It's all real!', 'The magic is back!'... it's all a ploy to appease a vocal minority of sad losers that couldn't stand that Episodes 1,2, and 3 tried new things. Even the title of the movie is a shot at the prequels. 'The Force Awakens', as if those 3 massively popular movies somehow put the force to sleep. Once again, all of these decisions are corporate based. As a result, we get a two hour apology tour. They hear people complain about dialogue, so everyone becomes an over-acting spunk machine. They hear people complain about politics, so they ax that aspect entirely. Basically, they hear people complain about the prequels, so they do everything possible to remove them from memory. 'We hate George Lucas and the prequels too, see?' Because the vocal minority of whiners is more important than the majority of people who love Lucas' entire saga. It's almost shocking how disrespectful Lucasfilm has been to prequel fans and Lucas himself. Almost. 4. This Is A Troubling Sign Of Things To Come. <ul><li>The Force Awakens ushers in an era of prostitution for the Star Wars name. With Episode 7, Disney has learned that they can make whatever they want, and as long they do exactly what the 'fans' tell them, they'll have a cash cow that never dries up, and they'll never have anyone complain. After all, fans are getting everything they want, right? Well what about those of us that want to see NEW things? These corporations don't care about us. New ideas could upset people, so innovation loses over imitation. The Star Wars story ended in 2005. It's time for something new. Boycott the rest of Disney's Star Wars fan-fiction, and maybe we can prevent Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens from being the movie that killed the blockbuster.</li></ul>",1,192,250,7 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," George Lucas' Timeless Classic
","Before Star Wars became a multifaceted genre unto itself, before it became an executive-managed branch of the Disney Corporation, before it was even a saga, it was a movie. That movie, retroactively titled A New Hope, came from the mind of George Lucas and penetrated straight into the public consciousness like a bolt from the blue. A New Hope is one of the handful of movies to attain cinematic immortality. George Lucas' timeless myth exists on a plane that few movies can ever reach, as a kind of magical accident. You can't intellectualize why Star Wars works like it does, although many, many, many people have tried. It's George Lucas' disparate tastes and goals that shape A New Hope into something utterly unique in Hollywood. Westerns, samurai movies, science fiction B-pictures, and classical mythologies are the raw ingredients to Star Wars. When filtered through George Lucas' imagination, it comes out as a towering landmark in film history and the first step of a story that will last for all-time.I'm in no position to add anything new to the discussion of A New Hope's greatness as an adventure or as a kid-friendly vehicle for universal themes. What I can describe is the appeal A New Hope has for me. In comparison with the rest of Lucas' saga, A New Hope is smaller in scope and less ambitious in themes. It's the broadest Star Wars movie, a good vs evil fable without the complexities of later entries. It is also, by nature of being the first, the clunkiest Star Wars film visually. The special effects are the baseline for what the series could do. They only got better with time. When it's all said and done, it might be my least favorite of Lucas' Star Wars movies. And yet, it works in ways that none of the other five do. A New Hope is the Star Wars movie that will live on a hundred years from now. It has an effervescent magic, an innocent exuberance that no other Star Wars film can boast quite as well. It has a sense of place and verisimilitude that I am always amazed by. You can't help but feel you have actually sat in the dusty cantina and walked through the cavernous halls of the Death Star every time you watch it.A New Hope defines the strange wonder of Star Wars, as something completely new and yet cobbled from the most varied and interesting of sources. It captures the oddity of Star Wars, and of George Lucas' child-like imagination. It is movie magic, the strongest piece of purely cinematic myth making ever created. Its best qualities can be lost in comparison with the other Star Wars films. And it's true, I have a personal fondness for the others of the series, but they simply can't compare to A New Hope for pure impact. As a movie, and not part of an ongoing episodic tapestry, A New Hope is the one we will remember most fondly.90/100",9,0,0,15 March 2020
Deadpool," Everything Wrong with Hollywood in One, Smug, Vulgar, Annoying Package
","Hollywood has a ton of problems these days. An irrational reliance on big, loud, CGI filled blockbusters, a fixation with TV style digital cinematography, and a compulsion to make movies that are meme-friendly, self-congratulatory, and above all, trendy. This describes the downright depressing point Hollywood has fallen to in the past decade or so. It also describes, to a tee, Deadpool. This subversive superhero movie is a personification of everything today's sardonic millennial moviegoers cherish. It's vulgar, violent, ugly, devious, ironic, and hip. It's one, big meme. Comic book nerds and teenage boys love it. Fine. I hated every second.The problem right away is that Deadpool is a terrible character. He's a joke, but one that is only funny to those who drool over spandex-clad musclemen and collect kids' toys in their free time. I'm talking about nerds. Deadpool is what nerds think 'cool' is. Played with infuriatingly self-satisfied panache by nerd God Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool is an impeccably sculpted, overtly confident, wise-cracking nerd himself. He can win any self-respecting geek over with a quick reference and hardy, fourth wall breaking high five for those who get it. For those in the know, Deadpool is a naughty wish fulfillment character. The asshole they always wished they could be. To the rest of us, he's just an asshole.Deadpool is among the most unpleasant movies I have ever sat through. I could go a step further and say it is the most unpleasant two hours it could possibly be. Deadpool serves as a shining example of every single thing I hate about movies today. For starters, it's another superhero movie. For all director Tim Miller's insistence that this is a different kind of superhero story, it's really just a typical origin story, peppered with enough F-bombs and sex jokes to make something superficially unique. Secondly, the movie looks dreadful. Digital and grey, just like literally every other movie that has been released since 2010. Is it the current TV-Mania sweeping through the younger generation that is convincing filmmakers to replicate the cheap, washed out look of low budget television? Why else are movies getting worse and worse to look at? Third, and most egregiously, Deadpool is relentlessly full of itself. The script really isn't a script so much as it is a list of jokes, gags, and winks meant only to placate the fans who practically bullied the movie into existence. Deadpool knows its audience will go gaga for its star and his dumb schtick. In fact, they are so confident of their dominion over geekdom that the whole thing reeks of the kind of self-satisfied arrogance of a hack comedian making a dumb crowd go wild.Deadpool is a movie that will make you lose faith in movies. Hell, it made me lose faith in humanity. If this is the kind of thing people will praise as the new gospel, then we as a race are in serious trouble. Deadpool is a bland superhero movie, a vulgar comedy, and a cynical corporate exercise rolled into a rotten chimichanga of the worst impulses of modern Hollywood. It's not technically the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is, in its relentless nastiness, one of the most thoroughly depressing. I got no enjoyment from Deadpool, and it made me question whether I will ever like a movie again.07/100",1,32,63,17 February 2018
Incredibles 2," Incredibles 2 Packs an Action Punch, but Lacks the Original's Creative Spark
","Since 2010, Pixar, the one-time CG animation juggernaut, has been crippled by the sequel bug. The studio that for a solid decade plus made nothing but modern classics, has in recent years strained to imitate the formula that launched them into the animation stratosphere in 1995. The result of this effort? Sequels to nearly all of their most beloved films. Their latest, and possibly most anticipated, is Incredibles 2. The original Incredibles is one of the five most influential movies of my childhood, and a perfect action movie in its own right, yet I was firmly in the minority when it came to the possible sequel. I didn't want one, and I suspect its writer and director Brad Bird didn't either. Because after a 14-year hiatus, The Incredibles sequel arrives with all the action and humor of the original, but none of its passion.Incredibles 2 begins immediately where The Incredibles ended; with The Underminer on the verge of a high-profile bank heist, and the newly assembled Incredibles ready to take him down. After that rousing introductory action scene, we are introduced to our new characters, Evelyn and Winston Deavor (Catherine Keener and Bob Odenkirk), a brother and sister duo determined to legalize 'supers'. To do this, they recruit Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone, to take on a publicity tour of sorts, and create goodwill among the people. Elastigirl is given the biggest spotlight, leaving her husband at home with the superkids. So the story goes, with Helen Parr performing grand acts of heroism while tracking down the mysterious Screenslaver, and Bob struggling to keep up at home. Throw in a handful of quirky new superheroes, and some spy thriller elements, and you have a plot that differs enough from the first film, but never does quite enough to justify itself as a natural continuation of the story. The Screenslaver is an interesting villain, and the mystery plot unfolds in relatively surprising ways, but I couldn't shake the feeling that this story was simply one of hundreds of possible exploits for the Incredible family. It pulls you in, but only as much as a new episode of your favorite TV show might. For me, that was plenty, but for fans feverish over where the series might head, it may be a disappointment.Incredibles 2 matches the first film in most important measures. Particularly the action and pacing that made The Incredibles so much more than just another cartoon. Despite directing only two or three films that can be considered 'action movies', Brad Bird has managed to position himself as one of the great action directors working. His work on Incredibles 2 once again proves why. Through several impossibly complex set-pieces, including an exceptional train rescue, Bird uses animation and action together like the maestro he is celebrated as. Because he's working within an animated comic book world, these action scenes always have something new up their sleeves. The various superpowers are utilized so deftly that it makes the Marvel and DC movies look like they're not even trying. Animation liberates great filmmakers, and if you needed more evidence that Brad Bird is indeed a great filmmaker, the truly rousing action scenes in Incredibles 2 should put that to bed. The film is also remarkably well paced. There are two distinctly different stories going on simultaneously, one a taut thriller and the other a family comedy, and it doesn't feel as if either is given too much or too little attention. That means the film moves steadily and purposefully, but still allows for laugh breaks and breathers. That doesn't mean both story threads are equally good, though. The home life stuff starts off as a pointedly funny look at superpowered parenting, before becoming a hit or miss sitcom by the end. If you like baby noises, boy is this for you! Me? I found Jack Jack's antics (involving his increasing number of powers) annoying. Baby giggles are low hanging fruit for a sequel whose predecessor was so naturally, and confidently clever in its humor. I was also struck by how off line the voice performances were. Craig T. Nelson sounds totally disinterested throughout, and the supporting characters are always pushing a little too hard for a laugh. Holly Hunter is the only one to recapture the casually natural sound that made the first movie special.It all leads back to my initial hypothesis. I don't think Brad Bird really wanted to make this movie. Why else for the 14-year gap? It's not as if the script connected to the first in any meaningful way, or broke any new ground. It's simply a hunk of meat, thrown to the fans to shut them up. And at the same time, it's really good. Bird is the key player. He's a great filmmaker, and he keeps Incredibles 2 lively and fun. So a few gags failed to land, so what? The film works. The action scenes pop off the screen, the story moves along briskly, and there are good, hardy laughs along the way. You can't recapture lightning in a bottle. Incredibles 2 doesn't. But in terms of sequels, I can live with something that entertains and thrills heartily, even if it doesn't meet the original's passion.76/100",7,1,1,31 July 2018
Braveheart," Mel Gibson Fights for Freedom in Braveheart, A Full-Throated Epic of Overwhelming Emotion and Intense Beauty
","Braveheart is a rousing adventure, a passionate romance, and a soul-stirring drama. In short, Mel Gibson's 1995 classic is everything a great Hollywood epic should be. Gibson's second feature film as a director was a revelation. Who knew that Mel Gibson, an established action superstar and leading man, would be capable of helming a grand Medieval epic with the artistry of Braveheart? The story of William Wallace's legendary fight against English tyranny in Medieval Scotland works as a strong action spectacle, but more than that, Braveheart is a heart-rending, almost spiritual experience, a rare film of bellowing passion that earns every towering emotion it conjures.Braveheart tackles the ambitious task of retelling the legend of William Wallace (Mel Gibson), a Scottish warrior who led a revolt against the English occupants of Scotland in the early part of the 14th Century. After his secret love (Catherine McCormack) is killed by English noblemen occupying the Scot's village, Wallace begins a rebellion that eventually leads all the way to King Longshanks (Partrick McGoohan) of England. The story is not a historical retelling of the real William Wallace, but an account of the mythic figure of William Wallace, the larger-than-life Scottish hero. Mel Gibson is at his charismatic best as Wallace. His presence on screen conveys every bit of the folk legend that Wallace has become. It might not be an accurate portrait of a real historical figure, but it is an exquisite visualization of a fabled warrior. The movie is, after all, based on the epic poem written by Blind Harry in the 15th Century. The choice to treat the story romantically rather than realistically is treated as a negative by some, but it is actually a brilliant decision by Gibson and screenwriter Randall Wallace. The romantic approach opens the film up to more emotion, more drama, and more action than a straightforward docu-drama would. Braveheart relishes in the romance of a time and place. The story is massive in scope, and it plays to all those time-tested notes of classic Hollywood adventures. Braveheart is a sentimentalized version of William Wallace, no doubt, but it is also surprisingly authentic. From the muddy village huts and crude stone castles to the close-quarter violence of the battle scenes, Braveheart is a legitimately unvarnished look into the cold, cruel world of Medieval Scotland. This marriage of idealism and realism strikes at the heart of what makes Braveheart so special. It works just as well as a tear-jerker and an action adventure.One of the standouts in Braveheart are the battle scenes, which Mel Gibson stages with tremendous scale and violence. The action is appropriately chaotic, but the way Gibson and editor Steven Rosenblum cut between the indecipherable mayhem and punctuative killshots gives the battles orientation. The violence is effective. Every brutal blow is wince-inducingly severe. This is not typical Hollywood sword and sandals action, this is real, visceral action, and it carries a purpose. Braveheart brilliantly captures the strategy, as well as the barbarism inherent in Medieval warfare.Braveheart is a fantastic action epic, but it outclasses those trappings. There have been many historical epics that have come and gone before and after Braveheart, but precious few of them can compete with this film's craftsmanship. What Gibson has achieved here is almost miraculous. He takes what might be groaning clich√©s in the hands of a lesser director, and injects them with a poignancy that they frankly do not deserve. We get the obligatory love stories, the death scenes, the speeches, the evil kings and the treacherous allies. It's all been done before, but never with such unbridled passion behind the camera. The characters are archetypes, but they show what influence a great director and great actors can have on a character. The supporting cast is so filled with personality, you just cannot help but root for what could have easily become two-dimensional placeholders. James Cosmo's Campbell, Brenden Gleeson's Hamish, and Sophie Marceau's compassionate Princess Isabelle are excellent, and Angus MacFadyen as Robert the Bruce does Oscar-worthy work as a man who's loyalty balances precariously between the English and the Scottish sides of the conflict. James Horner's music may be the under-appreciated key to Braveheart's success. The mournful bagpipes and spirited Scottish melodies of Horner's score are downright essential for the film's emotional climaxes, of which there are many. When those climaxes hit, they hit hard, and that is thanks in large part to the music. Horner's score carries the same earnest spirit of the rest of the production. The music of Braveheart is precisely as big and bold as the story demands.Braveheart is a masculine story, a simple-minded tale of heroes and villains executed with brute force. Of course it is an exciting action movie, we might have expected that from the star of Mad Max and Lethal Weapon, but the real discovery in Braveheart is its beauty. For all its violence and primitive mayhem, Braveheart never lets go of its absolutely rousing grandeur. It doesn't just allow you to look on it with appreciation, it demands it. Braveheart is cathartic in the way it overpowers you with emotion. There are shots in this film that nearly brought me to tears by their sheer beauty alone. When the story, the characters, the images (filmed by cinematographer John Toll), and the music crescendo, it hits like a wave of overwhelming gratitude. The admirable thing about Braveheart is how Gibson and company stick to their guns. They don't conceal the drama or play it subtly. Gibson allows the tragedies, the treachery, and the triumphs of the William Wallace legend to be extravagant. The story is sprawling, the romances are passionate, and the emotions are let out with uninhibited fury. Braveheart is a man's movie, a brutal action epic that will satisfy any red-blooded man's desire for violence and carnage. The remarkable thing is that Braveheart is also a movie that moved me like few have before. 95/100",10,97,122,11 May 2017
Gladiator," Both Old-Fashioned And Modern, Gladiator Is An Intoxicating Blend Of Action Spectacle and Intimate Drama
","Gladiator, 2000's Best Picture winner, was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the decade. It made tons of box-office cash, nearly swept the Oscars, and revitalized the sword-and-sandals genre for years to come. Does the movie warrant the massive success it received? For the most part, yes. Ridley Scott's Roman blockbuster doesn't have quite the overwhelming emotion of another Oscar-winning epic, Braveheart, but as a brawny action spectacle, Gladiator soars. With a strong story, a profound sense of character, and action and special effects that are suitably exciting, Gladiator is a special kind of sword-and-sandals picture; One with a true dramatic core.Like the great epics of Hollywood's past, Gladiator is simple in its story. Russell Crowe stars as the Roman General, Maximus, whose life is thrown into chaos after the jealous Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arranges for his execution. Maximus is sold into slavery where he meets Proximo, a former gladiator played by Oliver Reed who shepherds him through life as a gladiator as Commodus scrambles to stop Maximus' influence among the people. The story of Gladiator is a rock-solid tale of revenge, bolstered by well written characters, some sly political subtext, and a couple of stellar performances from Crowe and Phoenix. The two principle characters, Maximus and Commodus, are what separates Gladiator from the slew of sword-and-sandals epics that came after it. They are simply but elegantly written as characters; Maximus, a man singularly driven by a need to return to his family, Commodus, a confused young man singularly driven by a need to be loved. However, it is the performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix that really elevate this material. Phoenix gives a brilliant portrait of an emotionally frustrated young man. He is completely unpredictable, but he never becomes campy. He is a real person with real problems, and there is an underlying sadness to his character that makes him so much more interesting than your typical stock villain. As for Crowe, his performance is all about physical presence. Apart from a few big emotional scenes, Crowe's performance is one of quiet masculine stoicism. He adds a remarkable gravitas to this character that all but makes the movie. You feel for him, you relate to him, you root for him, and you become inspired by him. It is a perfect heroic performance. The character stuff in Gladiator really works. Coming from a genre that made do with archetypal characters doing obligatory British accents for years, it is nothing short of a revelation that Gladiator is such a fulfilling dramatic experience. Here are characters you actually care about and not simply placeholders to string up the plot in between action scenes.When it comes to general filmmaking, Gladiator is rarely pedestrian and often astounding. Apart from some strange quirks in the filmmaking like the seemingly digitized zooms or the moments when the frame rate seems to cause a weird flicker effect, Gladiator is a deep, rich, and meticulously detailed visual experience. Hollywood production values don't get much higher than this. The technical departments are tops in terms of production design and costuming. The movie looks expensive, but there is something else in Gladiator's visual style that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The look of the film, with its mix of traditional, large- scale sets and CG enhancements, is almost dreamlike. The environments of Ridley Scott's version of ancient Rome, including a painstakingly crafted digital recreation of the famous Colosseum, seem untethered to any kind of physical reality. It's as if what Scott has created is an environment that reflects the feeling of Ancient Rome rather than the reality of it. Just as with the deep characters and eloquent script, there's a modern feeling to Ridley Scott's filmmaking in Gladiator. The reliance on CGI is sometimes overdone, but in conjunction with the costumes, sets, and impressively grandiose score from Hans Zimmer, it adds to the intoxicating atmosphere of Ridley Scott's world.The main attraction of Gladiator is its scenes of gladiatorial combat, and on that front, Ridley Scott aptly gets the job done. There are a few moments when Scott falls back on to standard sword clashing and disorientating shaky cam, but for the most part, the action scenes are exciting, bloody, and imaginatively staged. The best action scenes are the opening Barbarian battle and a fantastic fight scene between Maximus, a veteran gladiator, and a Colosseum full of bloodthirsty tigers. In those scenes, Scott's emphasis on close-up, sweaty, brutal action is totally effective. I felt the cold of the forest mud, the heat of the flaming trees, the sharpness of the swords, and the dusty claustrophobia of the Arena. The action of Gladiator is visceral and bloody, and there is plenty of it. Those hungry for bloodsport will find more than enough manly derring-do to satiate their red-blooded desire.For all its dramatic depth, I can't say I came out of Gladiator heavily affected by feeling. This is still, at its core, a visceral experience, but the small character moments and the textured performances are miraculously riveting. I was intrigued by every second of Gladiator. The action scenes are thrilling, the dramatic scenes are mesmerizing, and the $103 million budget is all up there on the screen in every frame. Ridley Scott's direction is superlative, especially in the third act, as the story, action, and emotions reach a fever pitch. The last few scenes, including the climactic final showdown and the closing 'Elysium' scene, exhibit a crescendo of the kind of daring artistry that permeates the film's best sections. Gladiator is a meaty Hollywood epic of the best kind. It's visually sumptuous and supremely thrilling, but there is a beating heart within this beast. Sure there are a couple of bumps along the way, but with Crowe as the sturdy hero and a simple story of returning home, Gladiator stays with you long after the credits roll.92/100",9,18,19,9 July 2017
Pocahontas," Beautiful... In Every Sense of the Word
","During the famed 'Disney Renaissance', a period that started in 1989 with the release of The Little Mermaid and continued through the entire 1990s, Disney was creating modern classics with every film they released. In the midst of this revolution came Pocahontas, a rousing animated musical, directed by Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg. Pocahontas is something of an outlier in the Disney cannon. It is not a cutesy, kid-centric fairy tale a la Disney classics like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or Beauty and the Beast. What Disney's 33rd animated feature is, is a sensational movie musical, and one of Disney's most technically accomplished works.Pocahontas, in typical Disney style, takes a well-known tale and molds it into an easy-to-digest story set to music. In this case, for the first time at Disney, the story is not entirely fictional. Here's where some people come down on Pocahontas. No, it didn't stay completely true to what really happened with John Smith and the real story of Pocahontas, but it would be a much lesser movie if it had. Pocahontas, the movie, is based on the legend of Pocahontas rather than the reality. The decision to romanticize the legend is a no-brainer. This is Disney after all. We expect strong archetypes and accessible drama.The story begins with English settlers setting off for Virginia. Their leader, Governor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) comes in search of gold, John Smith (Mel Gibson) comes for the adventure of a lifetime. Back on the New World is Pocahontas, a young Algonquin princess voiced by Irene Bedard, who is set to be married to the tribe's dashing bachelor, Kocoum. It's all very predictable Disney stuff. The settlers are mostly just boisterous, gold-lusting, brutes, The princess is weary of getting together with the jock character, and there's only one man who understands her. We've heard it before. Even so, the story is handled with care and the familiar elements are welcome for the most part. The unfamiliar elements, chief of which is a surprisingly mature and complex love story between John Smith and Pocahontas, are where Pocahontas' plot stands out from its Disney siblings. There is more to this film than surface layer romance. Complimenting the dramatic story of betrayal and acceptance is a poignant message about coexisting peacefully with each other and the world around us.The story is as moving as any other Disney classic, but what makes Pocahontas a notable Disney Renaissance landmark is its animation and music. Hand drawn animation had been around for a half century before Pocahontas, and stage musicals a hundred years before that. It's a wonder then, that somehow Pocahontas still manages to be a jaw-dropping example of both. I don't think the film gets the credit it deserves as one of Disney's best drawn films. The animators, led by the legendary Glen Keane, do things with animation that were game-changing, even by the high standard set by the world's leading animation studio. The character designs are expertly idealized, accentuating facial features and movement without ever crossing the line into cartoon. The backgrounds are even better. The untouched beauty of the American landscape is given scale, depth, and an expressionistic dynamism. It all comes together in the musical numbers. Music is always a matter of taste, but for me, every song down the line in Pocahontas worked in a big way. I honestly cannot think of another musical that can make that claim. Every musical, animated or otherwise, has at least one dud. It's a rule. Pocahontas breaks tradition. The rhythmic 'Just Around the Riverbend', the wonderfully wicked 'Mine, Mine, Mine', and the grand, Oscar-winning spectacle that is 'Colors of the Wind' are all rousing, bombastic, and sweeping pieces of music. The songs are up to the quality of the very best Broadway musicals, and the animation only improves the numbers. The explosively vivid colors and spacious movement that go along with the songs are artistry of the highest kind.There is a surplus of talent and passion in every fiber of Pocahontas. When all the pieces come together, the story, the animation, and the music, Pocahontas is remarkable. It's a film of craftsmanship and quality. While kids will no doubt enjoy it, it's not made 'for' kids. Like the best Disney movies, Pocahontas appeals to anyone who loves music and appreciates the warm touch of hand drawn animation. Add to the sights and sounds, some of which were enough to literally take my breath away from me, a timeless message of acceptance and stewardship of nature, and what you get is a classic, Disney or otherwise. Show this movie to your kids, watch it yourself, just see it. Pocahontas is in a word... Beautiful.92/100",9,44,53,18 November 2015
