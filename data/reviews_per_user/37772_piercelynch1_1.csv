Skyfall," Im sorry,but was i watching the same movie.
","I just had to comment after seeing so many glowing reviews of the same movie I just sat through.Come on guys are we that easily pleased these days.The movie is plain and simply boring.The first half an hour is well worth a watch but after that its a snore-fest,as i entered this snore-fest I found myself checking my watch a number of times,not a great thing if the movie is as good as many others have boasted. Bond gets shot (in the shoulder)by a MI5 marks-woman (Eve)and this somehow ruins his future,we learn later he heard the order being given to take the shot,so why the hell didn't he duck,dive or just plain old spin the villain in the direction of the shot.This is where his loyalty is tested,wow I feel so hurt for him.....NOT. The main villain (Silva) is supposed to let us believe that what ever he needs to demolish or take control of all he needs to do is flip open a laptop and away he goes,the world is his.Sorry but if this guy is supposed to be as professional as we are led to believe,then MI5 are on their last legs,the guy is an idiot,come on,a firefight to kill Bond. Im sorry guys but I found this movie,boring,dimwitted and a waste of 143 minutes. Oh how could I forget about the twists,if I was 10 or 11 then maybe id be astonished ( OK maybe even at that age I'm pushing it~) but again the same word comes to mind 'boring'. It also looks like Craig is soon to be replaced,they played on his age factor a fair bit in the movie too,id say he has maybe 2 more starring roles to go before they replace him. Its not the actors,its not the sets,its not the action (or lack of) these are all as good as all the other bond movies.Its the writing and direction that falls flat on this one. We go to a bond movie to be amazed,shocked,seduced and entertained and this one just does not deliver.Sorry but all I can give this is a 3 out of 10 and thats only for the first half an hour to be honest.Don't waste your money on going to see this in the cinema,rent it,at least you can pause,eat,drink and smoke or do what ever you do when you get bored. Beware,anyone who rates this movie over an 5 is either cast,crew or part of the production team,after reading the overly positive reviews it becomes more and more apparent.Don't say you were not warned !",3,26,53,3 November 2012
