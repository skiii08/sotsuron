It," Decent reproduction
","Decent enough to watch n faithfully followed the original. However, the characters lacked chemistry n charisma n weren't as likeable as in the original movie.
Good enough to sit through but acting a little wooden n what special effects that were in the film were ok.",8,0,0,26 March 2020
Wind River," Sound too low! Phenomenal!
","I have to agree with another reviewer! I had to turn my TV to max to even make out what anyone was saying n therefore I couldn't follow the plot! Mumble mumble mumble n hey! Hey! Every now n then! Mumble mumble mumble hey! Repetitive.Great story just extremely poor audio n I have excellent hearing although this was in dispute whilst trying so hard to hear the dialogue.Gunshots were phenomenally loud!!!! Such a brilliant beautiful film spoiled by lack of audioI've watched it once again when everything around me was silent. Beautiful brilliant take on a relevantly common movie topic!!!I can't emphasise how poignant this film is, from violence to extremely private moments with a sincere ending to the many who may not be with us anymore.Absolutely brilliant n sometimes tearful n gutwrenching! Outstanding!",10,0,0,21 August 2018
Se7en," Crap ending
",A very long movie with lots of holes. However the brilliant Morgan Freeman was outstanding. Pretty predictable after the first half but still not too bad for spending a couple of hours of action.I would have given it more stars had it not been so obvious of the reasons of the murders n the so predictable outcome.,6,0,0,28 August 2018
World War Z," Updated version of an old idea
","Predictable throughout. Nothing much left to say except Brad Pitt wasn't a right choice of an actor in this role. The plot holes were too many too count but hats off to the zombie actors!!!! Incredible movement of involuntary body parts!!!!
I've just finally watched the end of the movie after an hour of giving my head a shake! It's even more outlandish than I can say with words. I've already submitted 5 stars but I'm deducting 2 simply for the crap ending n ever so predictable plot n holes in it too!!! The world war Z? Where did the electricity supply come from at the end of an apocalypse? Fuel? Recharging phone's? Absurd!",5,0,2,27 October 2018
Predator," Excellent in every aspect!!!
","I needn't say anything more about this movie!
Like another reviewer said....'they don't make them like they used to!'.. ..
Brilliant n a must see for every young movie buff.",10,0,0,11 September 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," OUTSTANDING!!!!!!
","Just got back from the cinema and I can honestly say with my hand on my heart that this is a brilliant breathtaking portrayal of an icon!!!!From the acting n writing I felt like I was back in time to a historic event in the life of a superb human being!!!!No sex drugs, bad language etc just a magnificent movie n I'll eat my words if this movie doesn't get nominated far an Oscar!!!!I cried n laughed n stomped along to the music ðŸ˜ŠA must see even if you weren't around at that time ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š brilliant!!!!!",10,2,2,14 November 2018
The Thing," Finally a brilliant movie!!!
",No darling babes in full make up or 6pack beefcakes!!!A brilliant on the edge of your seat movie n gritty with it!More please!,10,2,7,9 November 2018
2012," Unintended comedy movie!
","Start......poop
Middle........poop
Ending........... More poopSilly CGI n graphics n action scenes bizzare!",3,2,6,2 September 2018
A Quiet Place," Stunning
",Superb piece of film with no virtual dialogue n little subtitles n beautifully acted. So tense n edge of seat movie n I held my breath n didn't blink much throughout it all. Highly recomend this n the aliens were unique n did indeed look convincing. Brilliant!!,10,2,2,19 March 2020
Sinister," Predictable n boring
","It's not a shock horror at all. It's a mediocre film that a 10 year old would find boring. I long for jump of the edge of your seat scary n this is definitely not one of them.
3 stars for effort n -7 for acting.",3,0,1,5 December 2018
Kong: Skull Island," WOAH!!!!!!
","Excellent adventure movie n sort of sci-fi (humongous animals etc) action packed from the getgo! Never a dull moment n acting a bit ott but still brilliant.
Great soundtrack too n a definite must see movie n kids of all ages (with parental guidance) will thoroughly enjoy it.
Cgi is first class n special effects amazing!
Finally Netflix got it right (I'm normally a massive horror buff).",10,3,4,26 October 2019
Mother!," Drama! Not horror!
","Utterly crap n a total waste of 2 hours of precious time I could have used washing the dogs feet.
The whole film was taken up with 'mother' shuffling about the house n staring blankly at a spot of blood (that's the horror!) on a rug and 'him' 'entertaining' totally random people knocked at their door.
Horror!!!! Catherine Cookson books/films have more blood n gore in them n if I wanted to watch a drama I would have gone to that section of Netflix!
Get your act together Netflix n put something decent on for a change!",1,4,7,19 September 2019
Life," Ã°Å¸ËœÂ±Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¨Ã°Å¸ËœÂ°Ã°Å¸ËœÂ±!!!!!!!
","That was amazing and shocking!!!! Had me on the edge of my seat! Heart racing n more horrifying than sci-fi! I don't have any idea why everyone is saying this film is crap! Maybe they're secret bookworms who pretend to enjoy a good escapism movie about the unexplored n unexpected!
I've been a major horror, sci-fi lover for many decades n this one was brilliant! Acting good, set good, heart racing constantly n that's what counts! It's really amazing n nothing like alien!",10,3,6,3 March 2019
Annihilation," Second time watching this movie!
","Had to watch it again, I think now it's more of a movie about female empowerment. I must stress that I am a female myself!
It's too focused on the voyages of female friendships than being about a sci-fi movie.
No edge of seats spooks n even when the renegade crocodile appeared it was more of a visit to the zoo!
Good film nonetheless but definitely not worth delaying coronation Street for.",6,2,5,26 March 2019
