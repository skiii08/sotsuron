Angels & Demons," What are your demons telling you to do.
","The Ring of the Fisherman, which bears the official papal seal must be destroyed immediately following the pope's death. The papal apartment is then sealed for nine days of mourning, which is a period known as sede vacante, which is the time of the empty throne which it is called. The pope has died and Catholic leaders from all over the world have flocked to see his end. The Cardinals lock themselves behind doors until they decide on a new pope. In a lab Silvano Bentivoglio (Carmen Argenziano) has created a very powerful animater with the help of his lab partner Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer).With in a matter of minutes the animater is stolen and Vittoria has found Silvanos eye ball on the ground not far from his dead body. Claudio Vencenzi (David Pasquesi), Corpodella Gendarmeria Vaticano has come to find Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) to figure out a case of the Illuminate, with the taking of four Cardinals from the Vatican. From his recent solving of church mysteries, he is told that he is the perfect guy to help stop this abomination. Figuring out through the numbers 503 which were shown numerous times Robert finds information in Galileos book which he needs to finish his second book that angels will lead their way in finding the Cardinals. Robert reads from Santi's early tomb with demon hole, they have their first location in finding each cardinal and saving them. With the help of Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård) and his men they hope to find each location before it's too late.This movie is yet thrilling and exciting to watch. Tom Hanks also lost weight for the part in this movie. In the first movie, he was with a younger actress and in this one he is with someone more close to his age which makes it better, actress Ayelet Zurer. From the first movie actually Hanks looks a whole lot healthier if that's the word in this one. Hank's has a lot to offer when he plays each character. With more movies to come his intriguing talent in his movies has not hit rock bottom yet and was fun to see him in this movie Angels and Demons.",7,0,0,18 November 2009
The Hangover," Funny from start to finish!
","Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) is getting married and for his bachelor party his friends Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper), Stu Price (Ed Helms), Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis), and him are going to Las Vegas to celebrate. Toasting to a night they will never forget, Alan wakes up and finds a Tiger in the bathroom, Phil calls Doug because he is nowhere to be found, and along with Stu woken up too they find a baby in the closet. None of them remembering anything that has happened and Stu somehow has lost a tooth. They all begin to empty their pockets and find traces of what they did last night to find the groom Doug.All throughout this movie there is a lot of funny scenes to keep you intrigued from start to end. I last saw Cooper in the movie 'What about Steve' where he plays a guy being chased by Sandra Bullocks crazy character throughout the movie. Which you can also see Cooper in some episodes of Nip/Tuck and the movie 'He's Just Not That into You'. Helms you can find in the show 'The Office and recently was in the movie 'The Goods'. Galifianakis you can find in the movie 'What happens in Vegas' and is in upcoming movies G-Force, Up in the Air, and Youth in Revolt. Bartha is in a couple movies I have never seen one being 'New York, I love you' and the others I am unsure of really, but what I most remember him in is the 'National Treasure' movies which were fun to watch. All of these guys play really great funny characters and I will look forward to seeing them again sometime soon!",8,1,3,12 December 2009
Star Trek," A new generation of Star Trek
","Somewhere in space U.S.S Kelvin ends up running into this huge romulan ship who fires on them and asks the Capitan to come aboard the ship or be destroyed. Nero (Eric Bana) the captian of the Romulan ship fires at Captain Robau of the U.S.S. Kelvin urging him to come aboard the ship or loose his whole crew, putting James Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) in charge. Pavel Lychnikoff (Romulan Commander)starts asking Nero questions about Spock and where he is, unable to answer it is made to look like he is eliminated. Giving Kirk no choice, he orders an immediate abandon ship, but he ends up staying aboard so everyone can leave safely. Crashing Kelvin into the romulan ship. Years later James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) the son of Jim Kirk, is older and gets into a bar fight trying to schmooze a star fleet crew member Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana). After doing so he is spoken to by Captian Pike (Bruce Greenwood) of the U.S.S Enterprise how he was assigned to the file of the U.S.S. Kelvin and how his dad saved his mothers and his life along with 800 members the day the romulans attacked them. Telling star fleet is missing that kind of bravery his father had done and given his assessments being off the charts he should enlist in star fleet. After agreeing to do so three years later, while in a simulation mission made by Spock (Leonard Nimoy) Jim finds a way to cheat the system and find a way to beat the scenario. Jim is then in front of a jury asked why he cheated Spocks program. The graphics in this movie and special effects are really great in this movie. It is true that this movie probably has nothing to do with the other Star Trek's or at least does not play off any of the other stories. Even tho that is the case, this movie keeps you intrigued and is very interesting to see this story unfold. J.J. Abrams who also directed recently TV shows Fringe and Lost is on his way to become a great director if he has not already done so. Along with a star studded cast this movie is soon to become one of your favorites and may have you going back to the old Star Trek movies just to see any sort of connection or resemblance.",8,1,5,15 November 2009
Fight Club," A movie a little far from the norm!
","Edward Norton (The Narrator) is a stock broker who is sent to go and check out what is going wrong with some cars. Norton's character meets Tyler Durten (Brad Pitt) who sells soap and teaches him how to live a little more. Tired of being consumers Dirten and Norton's character make a Fight Club which rule number one is, you don't talk about fight club.Based on a Novel by Chuck Palahniuk, this film has you look at paranoia in a whole new meaning. From one thing to another 'Fight Club' leads you in so many directions it intrigues you. With performances from Norton, Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter in this movie, it is a film that grew into a classic for many who love out of the norm films. If you have not seen this film I encourage you to, because it will blow your mind.",8,2,6,5 January 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Quentin Tarantino, your thinking there is going to be to much blood in this, actually not really.
","Brad Pitt, what more could you want in this movie? In Inglorious Basterds Pitt plays Lt. Aldo Raine who has assembled a group of Jews to disguise themselves at Nazi's and kill them. Your thinking what the heck that is stupid well there is more to it than that. Mélanie Laurent (Shosanna Dreyfus) is under disguise from the Nazi's so she wont be killed and says she owns a theater from her Aunt and Uncle who had passed away. Christoph Waltz (Col. Hans Landa) plays a German who is mostly in charge of finding all the Jews who are still in hiding. Raine along with others attempt to kill as many Germans and make a plan to eliminate Hilter with some new acquaintances. This movie has comedy, some drama, action, and romance all tied into one. One of Tarantino's best i would have to say, it is sure to be one of my favorite's. The movie also stars Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, Diane Kruger, Daniel Brühl, Til Schweiger, Gedeon Burkhard, B.J. Novak, and the list keeps going of coarse but those are some of the major characters in this movie. Probably not one to bring the kids to, but if you like Tarantino's style this might be a good one to check out. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.",8,2,11,15 October 2009
Public Enemies," Lets take a trip back to a criminal named John Dillinger back in the 1930's!
","1933, it is the fourth year of the great depression and for John Dillinger (Johnny Depp), Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi), and Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) it is the golden age of bank robbery. Agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) is assigned to track down and capture Dillinger. Purvis also is the Special Agent in charge of the Chicago field office. A declaration on the United States first war on crime is declared to capture every dangerous criminal throughout the U.S. starting with Dillinger. J. Edgar Hoover played by Billy Crudup is helping directs this movement of putting a stop to criminals.Two great actors in my book go head to head in this cat get mouse thriller. In a way, this movie reminds me of 'Catch Me if You Can', in which a kid Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) starts to make fraud checks making up fake identities and being chased by Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). One trying to out-whit the other and not be caught doing what he does best which in that case was getting money from fake checks and getting away with it. Love is a powerful thing and when it comes into affect for someone you start to put away your defenses really and become more peaceful rather than dangerous. This movie is a great adaptation of a true story off John Dillinger's life in the 1930's. This movie has a good plot too and should keep you intrigued from start to finish.",8,1,2,6 December 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The start of the new X-Men has arrived!
","In the Northwest Territories of Canada in 1845, Victor is watching over his friend James. His father is heard being shot and James runs down to find him dead. He then attacks the man who shot him with bones that come out from his hands putting them into the man's chest killing him as he tells him that he is his son. After doing so James flees the house Victor close behind him finally catches him. Victor tells James do you realize we are brothers now; we need to stick together no matter what and take care of anyone who gets in our way. There are flashes of the brothers Victor and James going through every major war and never stopping to look to the past. It gets to be too much and Victor ends up killing a Sr. officer and they both end up undergoing a firing squad. Striker opens their cell and tells them if they want to join a special team with special privileges they can join or either stay here and rot. They join the team and their mission is to get a rock that is from outer space which they yet don't know that. After they have gotten the rock from a heavily guarded building with diamonds they head to an African village to try and get answers where the rock came from. The villager said it came from the sky and not believing them, the villagers begin to run and people almost get killed including Victor almost killing the guy. James tells Victor to stop because he did not sign up for this and does not want to be a part of this team anymore and leaves with Victor yelling his name. Six years later Striker finds Logan working at a logging mill telling him that someone has killed Wade and Bradley not to long after that from the old team. Not wanting anything to do with it, he just says he wants nothing to do with it anymore. Logan tells his girlfriend about Striker showing up. The next day he smells a scent of Victor and finds his girlfriend dead close by her abandoned car. Tracking down Victor at a bar they battle it out and he tells Logan how else was I supposed to get your attention. Leaving Logan telling him he is more like him than he knows, he just doesn't know it yet. Waking up at a hospital and finding Striker there who tells Logan that Victor went AWOL and is coming after everyone from the old team. Wanting revenge for what his brother has done, Striker injects Logan with Adamantium which is what he was looking for in Africa that day six years ago, which is a metal so strong that he will be able to withstand virtually anything. Unlike the other X-men this one has a story although Last Stand did have somewhat of a story with Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto. Wolverine has some of the students from the other movies just starting to go to the school for the gifted for their powers, so I wonder if they will play off that a little more. This movie shows, how Logan/Wolverine has become what he is and how he lost his memory. The special effects in this movie are really amazing and also you get to see some characters which you probably have not seen in the other X-men movies. Even if you haven't seen the other X-men movies you don't have to because this one is about Logan/Wolverine which intrigues you more I think. I mean would you rather see the good guys fighting the bad guys with powers or have a story behind how each character grew and where they started out at? Even if you have never seen the other X-men movies I would highly recommend checking this one out before the others.",8,6,8,19 November 2009
Orphan," Make sure you adopt the right girl before its all said and done.
","Isabelle Fuhrman plays Esther in this horrific movie about a girl who is adopted after Vera Farmiga (Kate Coleman) and Peter Sarsgaard (John Coleman) lose a daughter. Also her daughter almost drowns after an alcohol incident by the ice. They finally decide that adopting another daughter would be a good idea, but what they didn't know about Esther is she as not as innocent as she looks. Esther starts off by pushing a girl off the playground jungle gym then escalades into more worse things than that including using a hammer and then making sure Max (Aryana Engineer) would not tell anyone about what happened. After that it gets more out of hand and she causes Kate and Peter to fight. This movie kind of reminded me of the Uninvited in some ways and you might think so too that is if you have seen the Uninvited. The thing i liked most about this movie is it was a mystery how Esther kept coning everyone and how she would play so innocent and not get blamed for anything. This is sure to be a favorite for some people who love horror movies. Just hope you enjoy it as i did. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.",7,2,3,23 October 2009
Terminator Salvation," Another Terminator, but i have no clue where this one fits in.
","Early in the 21st Century, Skynet, a military defense program, became self-aware. Viewing humanity as a threat to its existence, Skynet decided to strike first. The survivors of the nuclear fire called the event Judgement Day and lived only to face a new nightmare, the war against the machines. To hunt down and eradicate humans, Skynet built Terminators. As the war rages on, Leaders of the human resistance grow desperate. Some believing on a man that holds the key to salvation. Others believe he is a false Prophet; his name is John Connor (Christian Bale). The year is 2018.Upcoming Avatar's star Sam Worthington plays Markus Wright and Kyle Reese played by Star Trek's (Anton Yelchin). I had a feeling that I was going to watch somewhat of a destruction of human's type movie when going into this movie, but that is what to expect with the Terminator movies. You don't know what's going on most of the time tho and end up trying to figure out where this movie fits in with the other Terminators. Bale, last seeing him in 'The Dark Knight' which he did a superb job in playing John Connor which is a big role for him in this one too which he does a great job with. Also this movie leaves you wondering what happens after this, well hopefully not another movie for the Terminators.I mean look at Saw, already on it's sixth one and is still some how making death traps even though jigsaw died in the third movie. After only seeing Worthington in this movie you will start to like him I think and he has an upcoming role in hopefully a blockbuster hit movie Avatar which I am looking forward to seeing. Along with great special effects and graphics they have made somewhat of a computer generated face of Schwarzenegger which is done so well that will have you believe that it is him, but he does not talk at all. Anyways, take a look at this one if you liked the other Terminators and you might find this one fun to watch.",7,0,0,30 November 2009
500 Days of Summer," 500 days of heartbreaking memories!
","Throughout his life Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has been looking for that special someone in his life, when a new co-worker comes along named Summer (Zooey Deschanel). He thinks she might be the one and he starts to talk to Summer. This movie goes through the 500 days Tom has with Summer hence the title. This movie is a really heart warming story which is funny too, what is there not to like about Levitt and Deschanel's performance in this movie.Relationships have their ups and down and people don't like the idea of a relationship, but would rather be with someone rather than no one. Can a certain girl really ruin you life so much that you can't be yourself anymore until you get recognition from that person who you had in your heart to help you move on and go on with your life. This movie shows you that certain girls or guys can make you a better person throughout your relationship with them. I think every relationship makes you a stronger person and when you meet your next somebody it will surprise you without you even knowing at first. It's one movie that will tug at your heart a little a have you feeling sad and happy at the same time. The music also glides this story along and fits perfectly for this movie.",8,1,4,11 December 2009
Watchmen," A movie about Superheroes, just not your typical Superhero movie tho!
","They are the superhero's who protected people in this movie and this is their story. The world grew to not need superheros and some had no more purpose in their lives anymore and others became rich to help the world become a better place.In the beginning of this movie it shows the Comedian/Edward Blake saying that their lives as hero's will soon come to an end because they won't need them anymore. Along with masks becoming outlawed and superheros were not longer needed to maintain order. Overall you see in the superhero's eyes what their life was like and what decisions they have made to make the world a better place or what they think will make it better. Not knowing any of the actors in this movie except Malin Akerman who I recently saw in 'Couples Retreat', this movie is well acted, but most of all the graphics and the special effects are what made this movie good. This movie is two and a half hours long, but it's not one of those movies you would fall asleep watching. If you like superhero movies this one might be a little different for you, because it shows another side to superheroes you probably haven't seen yet.",8,0,2,30 November 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," Monters vs Aliens Review
","Your thinking this is just another dumb animated movie or something if you didn't like animated movies before. This movie Monsters vs. Aliens was really well done. A star studded cast includes Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Kiefer Sutherland, Rainn Wilson, Paul Rudd, Jeffrey Tambor, Ed Helms, Renee Zellweger, and John Krasinski. Seth Rogen's is of coarse the funniest but Reese Witherspoon does a great job playing Susan who starts out as a human and becomes a giant super hero. Galaxar (Wilson) tries to get back his powerful meteorite which gives you super strength and after sending one of his huge metal drones he takes matters into his own hands. Really great movie to watch with the family and with all these great actors it is soon to become a favorite of yours. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.",9,0,1,14 October 2009
District 9," Alien creatures coming to earth in this Peter Jackson masterpiece!
","Alien creatures come to earth and there are thousands of them which they have had to contain all of them into a location called District 9. Of all locations they came to Johanesburg, South Africa and the whole world was watching what happened next. They are to move what they call the Prawns out of Johannesburg to help all the people feel safer and so they won't contaminate the city anymore. Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) an alien's affair worker is promoted to evict the 1.8 million Prawns and give them the order that they will be moving soon. One of MNU's main focus is the Prawns weapons and to be able to use them, but only their DNA allows them access to use the weapons. Wikus becomes contaminated with an alien slim and starts to transform into on of the Prawns starting with his hand becoming one of the Prawns hands. He somehow escapes a test facility and tries to find a way to help the head Prawn in order to hopefully become a human again.This movie is strange, but kind of interesting at the same time. To find a normal guy turning into an alien who then helps them is really creative and fun to watch. This movie is one of a kind and I have never seen a movie like this before. All unknown actors and actresses at least I haven't seen them before in a movie, but this movie is really a ground breaking accomplishment for Peter Jackson which I'm sure he is glad he finally was able to make come to life.",8,0,2,21 December 2009
Twilight," Good movie for the first book or just plain hysterical.
","When Bella's mom decides to go on a road trip with her new husband Phil, she goes back to Forks, Washington to live with her dad Charlie (Billy Burke). He dad is the chief of Police in this small town. Having staying there two weeks every summer it has been years since she has been there last. First day at a new school and it's the middle of the semester in March. Her Biology partner is Edward Cullen, one of Mr. and Mrs. Cullen's several kids. Saying nothing the whole time the first time they meet. Bella (Kristen Stewart) finally is able to talk to Edward (Robert Pattinson) for the first time just chit chatting about the weather and why she moved here. Back and forth stares at Edward in the parking lot, a car almost hits her and Edward gets there in time to hold out his arm before it hits her. Bella try's to talk to Edward to get information out of him about how he stopped the van. Going to the beach she meets Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and he tells Bella of the Quileutes which are descended from wolves, which is where his tribe comes from. The Cullen's were found by the Quileutes hunting on their land back when his grandfather was chief of the tribe and made a deal with them. If they stay off the Quileutes land they would not tell the pale faces who they really are. I could go on with the whole or most of the beginning here, but I'm just going to give the basis of the story since almost every girl who was obsessed with the movie has seen it already. Filled with cheesy lines and funny reactions to situation leave you not being able to stop yourself form laughing. Like the moment in the Biology class when Bella comes in was pretty hysterical. After Pattinson's sudden death in 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', he was asked to be in 'Twilight' and he fit perfectly for the character of Edward Cullen. Kristen Stewart on the other hand this was her big break in her acting career. Along with the others in this movie this was their moment to be famous and be known and no longer known as a no-body in the acting world. Although this movie seems ridiculous at first the more you watch it it's not so bad and it's the start of more Twilight's to come. With the new movie of 'Twilight Saga: New Moon' looming every girl who was and still is crazy about Edward and Jacob's new wolf body is going to be there at the midnight showing in excitement to see what new things will happen in this one.",6,1,5,11 November 2009
2012," Highly spectacular and the most exciting end of the world movie I have seen yet.
","Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) goes underground 1100 feet in India to be shown by his good friend Gurdeep (Raj Lal) to find out there is major sizemic activity. The water goes down six feet and has started to boil also. Helmsey then goes to Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) an adviser of the president to show him the activity. Anheuser then tells Helmsey he reports anything he finds to him and him only. The President of the United States Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) then begins to talk to the leaders of the other countries about six months ago he was aware of activities happening which is so devastating that it will bring this world as we know it to an end. Throughout the world people are preparing for the worst including making plans to keep their family safe.Destruction of the world is a frightening thing and is a really devastating thing when you bring families and friends into the scenario. When life is very important in this situation, everyone goes a little chaotic as shown with the character Carl Anheuser. The person I didn't expect in this movie was Woody Harrelson who shined in his short but important role in this movie. Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor had the main leading roles in this movie and was exciting to see them in this one. The special effects are off the charts in this movie, the last time I saw something like this was in The Day After Tomorrow which this movie definitely outdoes that one which is the same Director actually. It could not have all happened without the great work from Ronald Emmerich who has also directed other action packed movies The Patriot, Independence Day, and 10,000 B.C.",8,1,5,17 November 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Twilight Saga: New Moon Flop or Not, The Review is in!
","In somewhat of a frightening dream of being old with Edward, Bella (Kristen Stewart) wakes up and it's the day of her birthday. Joking about getting old, Edward (Robert Pattinson) says he is one hundred and nine and she is only eighteen. Jake comes to talk with Bella and gives her some sort of a dream catcher gift. Edward saying it's unfair that Jake gave him a gift and doesn't get to. Edward saying it's unfair that Jake gave her a gift and he doesn't get to. Edward's gift is to just have Bella in his life and to be with her.This movie had a lot more action than the last movie and was more exciting to watch. This movie was serious, yet it had jokes to lighten the mood sometimes. The special effects were great and it was great to see the guys morph into wolves and just see how it looked on the big screen. Having no knowledge of the books the first movie wasn't really that good, but usually when doing more than one of a saga like this the first movie is the best, but not in this case. The relationships with Bella and Edward and her and Jake were very intriguing to watch. You felt bad for Bella who is just trying to figure out what she really wants in her life after starting it when she kept getting more and more close to Edward. Stewart, Pattinson, and Lautner are the main stars in this movie and they had a great performance along with the others as well, but theirs was overall more important. The Twilight movies can only get better and not looking to read the books anytime soon and get too much into the craze I will just be looking forward to the third movie coming out this next summer of 2010.",8,9,19,21 November 2009
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Food falling from the sky in an animated 3D movie, what more could you want!
","Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) has always tried inventing something useful the past ten years of his life. When one of his inventions actually works and it starts making it rain food from the clouds. Anna Faris (Sam Sparks) is the weather girl on the scene describing food that rains from the clouds that could make the town big once again.This movie is funny, animated, and comes in 3D which makes it fun to watch for the kids and whole family. I really thought this movie looked quite dumb when I saw it playing at the theater and then I saw it and I have started liking animated movies more and more. They are getting better too with the technology improving. This movie makes you realize what is important in your life and that being important isn't everything.",8,1,2,3 January 2010
Avatar," A humanoid population called the Na'vi protect their land as humans try and find a way to obtain anything they want from them.
","Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his brother have been cryogenically frozen for five and a half years. When he comes out of the state his brother is dead and has left an investment to work on a planet known as Pandora. He will make a lot of money for taking his brothers place since he has the same genetic order. He told himself that he do anything a marine could do and has the will to be the best. Every marine was told of the humanoid population called the Na'vi, they are very dangerous and hard to kill. With the help of Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and Dr. Max Patel (Dileep Rao) they combine avatar and human gene's so the humans are able to become and avatar to infiltrate their world and investigate their ways and life.Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) tells Grace the only reason they are here is to get Onubtanium, which is a rock worth millions to the humans. Jake reports to Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) who gives him a mission to give him intell on the Na'vi and he will give him his real legs back since he is paralyzed from the waist down. When exploring Pandorum with the help of Grace and Norm Spellman (Joel Moore) who has been studying the Na'vi, Jake is chased by a creature leaving him stranded in the woods. With creature trying to attack him he is saved by a beautiful Na'vi girl named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) who discovers he is graced by the Aiwa which is the Na'vi's god. Neytiri then takes Jake to her parents Moat (CCH Pounder) and Eytukan (Wes Studi) to tell them what she has seen from Aiwa. Neytiri is then asked to show the ways of the Na'vi to Jake and if he passes he is one of them. Jake discovers he has a stronger relationship with the Na'vi than the real world he lives in now.The graphics and the CGI in this movie were amazing and to see why this masterpiece took so long makes sense, because James Cameron did not have the kind of technology he did back then when he had the whole idea at hand. Everything comes together with great music and James Horner does a spectacular job in that part of making the scenes come to life with the right music for each situation throughout the film. Other music he has composed were from big movies such as A Beautiful Mind, Braveheart, Apocalypto, Troy, The New World, The Perfect Storm, Aliens, and most known for the music in Titanic. Hoping this movie wins some Golden Globe awards, because by far this was the most fantastic film I have seen this year. Along with what I have said the main actors Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and Stephen Lang all giving great performances worth winning any award in my book. Looking forward on seeing more work from them, this movie brings your feelings a boost and will give you feel good feelings if not an aching body from sitting through the whole movie.",9,2,6,19 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Drag Me to Hell

Christine has a elderly lady who needs another extension on her house when she has already had two. When faced with the decision to make on her own Christine denies her another loan. I know if i got more into the movie from here i would get carried away and just end up telling you the whole movie. Well after that you kind of get what is going on, Christine is getting haunted by the Dalia and her time is running out. This movie did seem like a lot of other exorcist movies but just some of the scenes in the movie keep you intrigued until the very end with a twist ending which can be figured out easily towards the ending. Definitely one to watch for a Halloween night or even before the night all ghouls and witches come out. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.",8,1,2,13 October 2009
Invictus," One true story of Nelson Madela giving inspiration to his Country!
","Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) becomes President of South Africa and vows to the people that the Country will never be the skunk of the world again. Becoming attracted to the sport of Rugby he contacts the captain of the South Africa spring league Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to bring greatness and inspiration to his country.For some people in order to give them inspiration to become great they need something to inspire them and that's what happened as shown in this film based on a true story. I have always thought the little things count in life weather it be helping out with a food shelf or giving people money, but to help the people of a Country is a big weight to put on your shoulders. To see joy and happiness in people's faces is a blessing from above and a blessing that if you have the power to give can in the end become a beautiful thing. Many people liked to be known for something or make a stand and a change. That is what I think Mandela did and the message Eastwood wanted to show in this powerful reincarnation of the true story.Freeman in this movie is so convincing to be the real Nelson Mandela. Even though there were some parts in the movie that were funny to me which I think were put in there to make the people laugh and enjoy the movie more and not make it all too serious. The only African-American actor/actress to appear in three Best Picture Oscar Winners: 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989), 'Unforgiven' (1992) and 'Million Dollar Baby' (2004). I have always seen Freeman as a man who stars in those thriller roles which make you cringe and as a down to earth guy that almost anyone can relate to.Damon plays his role well and without knowing the real person has a convincing yet honorable role as the captain of the South Africa Rugby Team of 1995. Something you may not know about Daman is that he dropped out of Harvard 12 credits short of graduating to pursue his acting career. Which I think is kind of a funny fact, because he became an actor anyways from not graduating there. I have always known Daman for his roles in Drama as well as Action films such as 'Good Will Hunting' (1997), 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' (1999), 'The Bourne Trillogy' movies (2002/2004/2007). Always playing the, I am tough guy willing to knock out a guy to get answers which would have served him well if he was given a role in the bond movies. I just think that wouldn't have fit his persona maybe though.Clint Eastwood, a living legend, best known for his roles in 'Million Dollar Baby' (2004) and 'Gran Torino' (2008) directs this film which actually is based off a true story off Nelson Mandela and the South Africa Rugby team. Even though Eastwood is done with his acting career, he will continue his directing of movies such as this one. Already having received an award from the National Board of Review for Best actor Morgan Freeman and Best Director Clint Eastwood it is nominated for 3 Golden Globes and another 3 wins and 8 nominations.",8,2,3,22 December 2009
Up," Up in the sky or the feeling of being up lifted.
","Carl Fredricksen played by Edward Asner is a young boy and starts out by watching his childhood hero Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) who is in South America at Paradise Falls discovering new species or almost that is. Showing him with Spirit of Adventure Metal blimp which he takes his adventures in.

Prospects of going to Paradise Falls and having the adventure he has always been waiting for. He meets up with Wilderness Explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) and talking dog Dug / Alpha (Bob Peterson). Going head to head with childhood hero Charles Muntz seen capturing a colored bird towards the end. Don't want to give much of the movie away, but this movie is sad and at the same time it makes you feel happy inside in the ending. Pixar did a great job and this is one of their movies that is probably one of the best of them all.",8,0,0,9 November 2009
Zombieland," Are you ready for some Zombie's?
","Alright, your thinking this is going to be a really dumb movie with Zombies and people running from them the whole time. right? Well its not your typical Zombie movie starring Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Abigail Bresin, and Bill Murray. Narrating some of the movie before he first see's signs of the Zombies and then after that he has made a set of rules to follow not to be killed by the Zombies and to live by. Meeting up with Harrelson and later meeting up with Stone which you probably remember her from Ghosts of Girlfriends Past lately. Also you can't forget Bresin who is taking on bigger roles and soon will be up to speed with Dakota Fanning even though we know they aren't the same age of course. You might remember Jessie Eisenberg from the movie Adventureland not too long ago and your thinking Zombieland, Adventureland. Is this kid going to be in all the movies ending in land. Not to sure on that but he is the main character in this movie as he was in Adventureland. I know you may think this might be kinda cheesy here, but once you get into it you will get that it is not really a waste of time. Eisenberg is a lot like Michael Cera in such that he has little lines throughout the movie, but with Eisenberg he kinda has a twitch to himself which you can see throughout the movie. Im guessing Eisenberg will take on roles Cera won't and hopefully grow in his acting career. Stone does a great job in this movie and I'm interested to see what she will star in next. I've enjoyed these young actors in this movie and they will only get better and have bigger roles to take on in the future. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.",8,2,4,13 October 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not as good as the first but what else did you expect.
","In Transformers:Revenge of the Fallen Shia LaBeouf is back as Sam Witwicky and in this one the Decepticons try to destroy Earth and along with that the rest of the Autobots. In this one you find out how Optimus Prime is the last one of his kind and what happened to the rest of the primes. Josh Duhamel (Major Lennox) and Tyrese Gibson (USAF Master Sergeant Epps) both return in this one and they are teamed up with the Autobots in a group Called NEST to find all the remaining Decepticons in different Countries trying to hide until NEST finds them. Sam is also off to college and Ron (Kevin Dunn) and Judy Witwicky (Julie White) are trying to face the facts that Sam is growing up. Judy is taking this off to college thing a little more harder than Ron. Mikaela (Megan Fox) is still Sam's girlfriend, but since Sam is going to college they are going to try a long distance relationship to stay together rather then break up. Also returning is Agent Simmons (John Turturro) from sector 7 helps them find and old Decepticon who helps them figure out how to save Optimus Prime to save the world from destruction from the Decepticons.

Here are also some of the other stars in the movie which are Ramon Rodriguez, Isabel Lucas, John Benjamin Hickey, Matthew Marsden, Andrew Howard, Michael Papajohn, Glenn Morshower, John Eric Bentley, and along with others. This is a fun one to watch with the family when watching movies for a family night in. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.",9,17,30,19 October 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are on the case to solve crimes and punch people out when they feel needed so!
","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and John Watson (Jude Law) have stopped Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) from killing another girl and Watson saw to it to his hanging for the use of black magic and the death of five girls. By his death and talking to Holmes beforehand he said, 'I will return and kill three more, death is only the beginning.'An old acquaintance Irene Adler (Rachael McAdams) happens to come back to see Holmes, but she may be up to more bad than good now. Both Holmes and Watson are always having fists pummeling the next unlawful hoe as well as gathering evidence to solve the case. Holmes has a way of analyzing everything and finding a solution to solve it whatever it may be. The funny thing is that Holmes and Watson fight about everything like they are brothers, but we all know they are just partners throughout. Witty jokes by both keep the seriousness out of the film. Quick witted and a personality that makes him a bit quirky Robert Downey plays the part perfectly as Holmes in this thriller of a film. McAdams character distracts Holmes yet keeps him interested in a beautiful glow that never strays her. Laws character fits him well and there are times that make you laugh with joy showing the flawed yet strong friendship the duo of Holmes and Watson share.The music and as well as the explosions, fight scenes, and funny lines gives the film intensity and intrigues you to want to see what happens next. A fun fact about Downey is that at the age of 10, while living in London, Robert attended the Perry House School in Chelsea and studied classical ballet. So, to come go back and experience taking part in a movie filmed in London for most of it. It was something he experienced from his childhood must have been a treat for Downey as well as the audience to see the great scenes of London in the film. As for Guy Ritchie, seeing his films he directed in the past being 'Snatch', 'RocknRolla', and 'Lock, Stock, and Smoke two Barrels' this film is a big step for him since I think his other movies didn't intrigue me, but left me wondering what I just saw and if I wanted to see it again just to remember.",8,2,7,25 December 2009
Iron Man," Tony Stark constructs a new iron suit of destruction to use for good!
","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the Worlds biggest creator of weaponry. He is captured by terrorists after showing the use of his new missiles and somehow escapes his enemy by the invention of a strong metal suit.If some terrorist were using your weapons for killing people, wouldn't you stop making them for one thing and try and stop them from hurting civilians. Also if you figured out your business partner is going against you for power and to take your spot, you would stop him from becoming to powerful, wouldn't you? When people are greedy they want the power and to be the one everyone answers to instead of vice versa. This movie most likely reminds me of Transformers with Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox. With aliens from space, that transform from cars into machines with guns throughout that movie to protect a cube from getting into enemy hands.Downey Jr. plays the character of Stark so well I don't think they could have picked a better actor for this role. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is convincing as a redhead and has a romantic tie in the movie to Stark having been by his side as his assistant all his years of his work with Stark Industries. Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is the bad guy in this film who just wants to be a step above stark as the CEO of Stark industries. This movie should give you a boost in your view of comic movies and have you wanting to see the next best movie with more technology, movies are becoming something different and more spectacular than we could only imagine. Plus also a romance between Potts and Stark comes into play through the movie because she has always been there for him throughout the years to help him with whatever he needs and realizes that she is the only one person he can count on in the end.Robert Downey Jr. is the son of underground filmmaker Robert Downey Sr.. His first part in a movie was in his father's Pound (1970), in which 5-year-old Downey played a puppy. During traffic stop for speeding, he was arrested for drunken driving, possession of heroin, and possession of an unloaded pistol in his pickup truck. This was his first reported brush with the law at age 31. He was given a suspended prison sentence of 3 years, and granted probation with requirements of random drug testing and drug counseling. Which was just two years before Iron Man came out. It is amazing how he changed his life around which is really someone to look up to I think, because some people can relate to his situation. Before he starred as Iron Man (2008), Downey had done films with three of the actors who played Batman: with George Clooney in Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005); with Val Kilmer in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005); and with Michael Keaton in Game 6 (2005).Continuing with his acting career Downey Jr. release of Shelock Holmes is only days away coming out on Christmas Day. Along with that he is working on the second film for Iron Man 2 to be released in the earlier months of 2010. His movie Sherlock Holmes I have only seen the preview for about a dozen times throughout watching movies or just on television. For Iron Man 2, it looks like there is to be more villains and more romantic ties with Pott's character played by Paltrow. Terrence Howard having been a fan of the comics of Iron Man plays Colonel Rhodes head of the Weapons Development. Which in part I though he played his character well so when he asked to be in the second Iron Man they didn't give him that approval to continue with his character. The actor to take the part of Colonel Rhodes will be played by Don Cheadle and the villains Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson and Ivan Vanko / Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke which are just some of the main characters to look forward to in the second Iron Man.",8,1,3,24 December 2009
The Ugly Truth," The Ugly fact that you have to be yourself.
","Katherine Heigl plays Abby Richter who is a Producer on Sacramento's morning show. Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) has a talk show that tells about men and women and their relationships. When Abby's cat gets outside and goes into a tree and she gets stuck she gets out with the help of her new neighbor Colin who is a Orthopedic Surgeon. After seeing Chadway on his show the ugly truth when Abby is getting new ideas to save her network, he shows up the next day at her office. Stuart (Nick Searcy) gives Chadway the job to improve on their ratings. When finding out Abby likes Colin she makes a deal with Abby that if he can get Colin to like Abby, she will help him on the morning show. Butler and Heigl make a funny comic duo in this film. Butler has many talents and has grown to be a versatile actor in his career. Heigel which last seeing her Grey's Anatomy, 27 dresses, and Knocked Up is as funny as always and fun to watch. This movie has a good message and shows you that you have to be yourself and not someone else when finding someone you want to be in a relationship with. This movie will give you laughs and have you satisfied at the end. check out more of my reviews at getthenew.com under brownah18, thanks.",8,1,4,7 November 2009
The Proposal," Marry me or you'll lose your job.
","Ryan Reynolds, you have seen his other movies right? Well in this one he is with still as always beautiful actress Sandra Bullock. Her character Margaret Tate is everyone's boss at a book company and everyone despises, including her assistant Andrew Paxton (Reynolds). After Margaret hears that her green card didn't go through she is going to be forced to go back to Canada. She does anything that she needs to do to stay in the United States, well New York you could say. When forcing Andrew to go along with the plan of marriage or you will lose your job Andrew agrees to go along with Margaret's plan. Reynolds recently in X-men Origins: Wolverine and Adventureland comes into this movie shinning. He is a really great actor to work with i think and is really funny. I have enjoyed watching his career only get better and better and hope to see him in another movie soon. Bullock is doing great as ever with her still slim and slender look which is good. She has a great role in this movie as Reynolds boss which makes it funny and delightful to watch. Im hoping after this movie we will see bullock do another movie that keeps audiences wanting more from her. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.",8,0,1,14 October 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," The good, the bad, and the ugly truth
","Gerald Butler and Jamie Foxx are the stars in their newest movie Law Abiding Citizen. Butler plays Clyde Shelton, when the movie starts out his family is getting robbed and then brutally murdered by Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte) and his partner in crime Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart). Shelton talks to the DA assistant on the case Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) who has already made a decision for Ames to serve in prison for ten years then will face the Death Penalty while Darby is set free after five years in prison. I have watched Butler grow in his acting career from P.S. I Love You, 300, Gamer, and his latest one before this movie the Ugly Truth with Katherine Heigl. He has shortly become one of the more popular actors. He has proved himself worthy of playing almost any role in a movie that is thrown at him. Without much spare time, i haven't been able to catch him on the tonight shows to hear him talk about his work. Foxx hasn't had as many movies come out since i saw him last in Dream Girls, but when he finds a role which is mostly a serious role in a drama type movie he plays the part well. His acting in Ray was so well done it makes you believe that he is actually the real Ray Charles. Foxx who actually sings too, has made some music off Charles music with him singing instead of Charles himself. Also Butler had a role in a Movie with music The Phantom of the Opera. Although you may have not noticed that the Phantom was him which i did not at first, just goes to show you what his capability has come to as an actor. The special effects if any were well done in this movie, if you call blowing up cars special effects. An intense movie that keeps you watching till the very end which leaves you wanting more from Foxx and Butler. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.",8,1,4,28 October 2009
