Stop-Loss," Stop-Loss, how much would that suck!
","Ryan Phillippe continues to impress me, as of late he has chosen great roles and given even better performances. He is most definitely on the very verge of becoming one of the great actors of today. The film itself is an emotional look into the lives of these soldiers and their families and confronts some very serious issues and questions of our times. It is at times powerful and emotional, none more then in it's final scene, a scene which is sheer perfection in it's inevitability and simplicity. Even in a smaller supporting role Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines and is easily one of the most underused and under-appreciated talents in Hollywood. As for Channing Tatum he delivers the performance of his life, unfortunately that's not saying much, I would hope he would use this to spring board to consistently better material from here on out because he has shown he is capable to take on things bigger then Step-Up. The 'girl' in this film, not her personally but her character seems like a waste, a girl thrown in like in so many other films just for the sake of having a girl, adds nothing to the large amount of screen time that she wastes. Even though at times this film does take a political stand on some issues, I was glad that they didn't go full bore down one way or the other. I think the missing side to this story and to so many of films of this kind is simply this, not every person that comes back from war are all screwed up, plenty of men and women go on to live a normal lives after seeing combat. Not every person that goes off to war has no other choice but to go, it is not only under privileged kids that can't hope for anything better. There are plenty of men and women who choose this life out of a feeling of duty and take it on with honor, who are committed to fighting for this country and the freedoms it allows us. To them we should simply say thank you. Hollywood's movies consistently imply that nothing good comes from war and at times they are right, but at times like now when the sons and daughters of America are overseas fighting, maybe we should spend a little less time debating the war and a little more praying for our soldiers and their safe return and for God to grant wisdom to our countries leadership.",8,0,0,8 July 2008
Children of Heaven," Perfect Family Film
","From Iran comes a wonderfully unique and family friendly film. Unique in the portrayals of it's children characters, children who act and feel like real children. Their acting is great and their emotions pull you right along with them. This film is a great example of simple storytelling that works in a grand way. This would be a great film for younger kids to see, much better for them and their young minds then some of the Hollywood trash that's pumped into their face. The subtitles are relatively easy to read and the story is simple and easy to follow. The camera work gives you a great feel for the area of Iran and it's people at the time. All said a unique and original film and in all the right ways.",8,1,1,19 July 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Visually stunning.
","Slightly better story wise then the original but that's not saying much. The focus is less character driven and more on just the next adventure of these characters. I guess we can't have both, that would take some intelligent writing and this is a super hero flick. Ron Perlman now owns the character of Hellboy, he has him down pat, unfortunately it just feels like a retread of the first Hellboy. Selma Blair is just plain awful, no point or purpose to her character really. With all that said you would expect a low ratting but surprise, that's not going to be the case. Guillermo del Toro is a visual genius, this movie is beautiful, his creature creations are amazing to look at and the special effects are great. The look of the film was just to good to let little things like story and acting bring it down. Also there is also a very memorable singing scene that I just loved, yes you heard me right.",7,3,7,11 July 2008
21," Blackjack, no but not a bust either.
","21 is pretty much as advertised in the many trailers I had seen, but in this case that's not all bad. It's trailer pretty much sets up the whole movie, introduces pretty much every character and gives me a pretty good guess as to how it will all play out. Trust me in no movie where the character says 'I'm going to do this but just until I get a set amount of money, then I'm out' do they ever hold true, never. I guess that would make for a very boring story, maybe, then again maybe not. Anyway the predictability for the most part doesn't bother me here, I'm too distracted by some solid performances and just some amazingly beautiful cinematography and camera work in all the Las Vegas scenes. But, and yes there is one, in the early moments of this film there is a scene that leaves the main character in what he feels is a hopeless situation, of course him not having the benefit of seeing the trailer like we all have, he doesn't know that the answer to his problem is just around the corner. Which separates us from the character and makes all the scenes after where he doesn't know what he's going to do so pointless to the audience. Also that early scene I mentioned earlier, remember? Ya, that anyone could watch that scene and not figure how this whole thing was going to end is beyond me. So I guess my bottom line is, the trailer tells you everything but doesn't seem to ruin it because it is a fun ride, the only thing that remains a mystery is how the ride will end, well the first 10 minutes took care of that mystery for me, so what remains, the fun ride and yes it is. Kevin Spacey is great, and by the way where has he disappeared to recently. Jim Strugess is a great up and coming young actor and Kate Bosworth plays her part well enough (but she should never have been Louis Lane). Laurence Fishburne has been better, way better but the length and pace of this film leaves little time to delve much deeper into his character and what time he has he puts to good use. Overall a fun and enjoyable movie, but far from worthy of a Chicken Dinner.",7,1,2,22 July 2008
Tropic Thunder," Thunderess
","I don't want to give to much away about this movie, I know that sounds weird about a comedy but in this case it's true. Some of the films most laugh out loud hilarious moments are surprises, things you wouldn't have expected just from seeing the trailer. I am so glad that is the case because so many comedies lately have been ruined by their funniest moments being in the trailer. With all that out of the way, this is a entertaining movie, a lot of that is due to the quality of Robert Downey Jr., he is without a doubt the most underrated actor in the main stream today. Sure this movie does not really give him a chance to really stretch his legs but he does bring his quality of acting to a genre that most dramatic actors dare to go. At times this film is really aimed at movie buffs, so of course I love that, all the little references or shots stole from other movies. Sometimes it takes movies like this to realize how overly dramatic certain other movie moments really are. Bottom line on this one is this, this film was not all I had hoped it would be but maybe my hopes were a little high, it's not often that I am excited to see a new comedy in theaters, so when I was maybe I expected a little to much. This film has many hilarious moments, many memorable lines, and some great surprises. Compared to most straight up comedies this is definitely a step above all the rest.",8,1,3,19 September 2008
The Love Guru," Critics have been unfair
","Austin Powers most definitely is not, no were even close, but is far from the horrid mess the critics have reviewed it as. A current 3.5 on IMDb is proof that if you get enough people to say some things crap then most people will see crap no matter what and forget the times the movie made them laugh. Or like a friend of mine who has a built in stereotype of comedies of this kind, anything with stupid or gross-out humor makes him forget about all other times the movie was funny. I'm not saying this, or movies of this kind are great by no means, but horrible and unwatchable they are not, and not deserving of a low ratting just for it's lower moments of comedy. OK, personnel venting out of the way, this is far from a great film. Funny at times but not enough, Jessica Alba's movie choices continue to make me wonder and after Justin Timberlake's fantastic work in both Alpha Dog and Black Snake Moan, this is a huge step back for him. Hell the fact that I just said Justin Timberlake and fantastic in the same sentence should be reason enough to keep him away from The Love Guru. Not that his character in this could have been way better, because it could have, I'm not sure if that's bad writing or bad directing. Honestly though, should anyone be even commenting on directing in a film like this, it's just one sketch scene after another with a little story to keep things moving. Wow, I have gone on way longer then this film deserves.",5,3,8,8 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Thank You Nolan
","Wow, so much more then you typical superhero movie, in fact easily the best superhero movie ever made. I have to wonder why it has taken this long for someone like Christopher Nolan to come along and take these characters seriously and treat them as if they are real people. I can do nothing but thank Nolan for raising the bar in this genre, I would hope more will now follow his example. The only problem with that is I can't imagine anyone doing anything close to as good or better then The Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan in my opinion has the only one who even has a chance to top this work. There are no words describe how spot on perfect Heath Ledger's Joker is, he completely embodies the character and takes him to a level neither him or the character have reached before. I was surprised to find the Ledger's performance didn't completely out shine the rest of the cast. Sure every Joker scene is amazing and your always left wanting more but the rest of the cast is awesome. Aaron Eckhart, Christian Bale and Gary Oldman are perfect, they play off each other amazingly and are the heart and soul of this film. Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman get more to do this time around and deliver some of the films most important lines. Maggie Gyllenhaal should have been cast as Rachel Dawes in the first place, Katie Holmes was a sore thumb that stood out in the all-star cast of Batman Begins. The special effects were amazing but more so because of the way they are blended into the film and feel less like 'special effect scenes' and more like necessities to the story. The music by the master Hans Zimmer is even better then the Batman Begins and that's saying something, there is simply said and epic feel or should I say sound to it. At a 2 hour and 45 min runtime it still was not long enough for me and just when I thought I had seen the best this film had to offer the last scenes and the overlaid speech, brought an amazing ending to this amazing film.",9,3,8,19 July 2008
The World's Fastest Indian," A master at work.
","If only more men were like Burt Munro, I don't know how many liberties the director and Anthony Hopkins took with the performance but if even a little bit of it is accurate the world is a better place for men like Munro. Hopkins once again gives a masterful performance that made me love the character for the opening minutes. Every time someone or something would set him back it was a s frustrating and heartbreaking to me as it was to Munro. I guess that's what makes Hopkins such a great actor, that the same man was Hannibal Lector makes it even more impressive. The story itself is amazing and inspirational, and had me cheering him on by the end. The only thing I have to complain about is the supporting cast, I felt they all gave about average performances, nothing stand out. But I wonder if that is because of Hopkins being so damn good that he overshadows everyone else. I think we could all take a lesson from the character of Burt Munro in this film, about how to treat others and how to live life.",8,1,1,9 July 2008
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," But why?
","Well, the music is great, unfortunately most everything else is way over the top. I do assume that most Tenacious D fans will not mind that, seeing as most Tenacious D fans are probably teenage boys. Here again is a perfect example how I do not fit into the stereotypes that go with my interests. Just because I like Tenacious D music must mean I also love gross out, over the top and just plain stupid comedy. In most cases those things do go together, but not in mine and sometimes that really sucks for me. Now I do admit being briefly amused by Jack Black a few other times and there were some clever ideas thrown in to the film but honestly is a full length movie really needed or necessary.",6,0,1,7 July 2008
Hancock," Gotta love trailers!
","Well, today were going to talk about trailers, I admit that I see more trailers then the average person but how could anyone miss seeing at least a few Hancock trailers seeing as they've been playing them forever and so very often. I think I have seen three different trailers and from those trailers I could have told anyone the whole plot and most of the plot points before the film even started. Even what I am sure most viewers saw as a surprise I could have told you was going to happen just by watching one trailer. I won't give away anything here of course but that anyone who has seen the trailers would be surprised by anything in this movie surprises me. Either I see to many movies or your average movie goers are rather stupid, I'd say a little of both. Also the first half of the movie was almost all in the trailer, nothing fresh or new that I hadn't seen before for at least the first 40 minutes. My point is that making trailers is a lost art, only a very few trailers a year are well made and don't give away the whole film. OK, now back to the movie, the idea for this film is great but this movie doesn't take advantage of that, and there are few things I hate more then bad trailers and wasted ideas. All that said I loved the music and a few scenes were great and could have been amazing if the story around it would have been better. I admit there was maybe three or four funny lines that I hadn't heard before going in, but in a Will Smith comedy only three or four kind of sucks.",6,1,2,12 July 2008
Never Back Down," Models, Models everywhere.
","Wow, there is not one ugly person in all of Orlando, at least that's what this film wants you to believe. Do any high schools or high school students look like this, come on. What I love best is the quote on the back of the box ' A little Karate Kid, a little Fight Club and a whole lot of The OC', WHAT? Is that suppose to make me buy it, please find me someone who loves all three of those, ya, no one. OK, so the film is not all bad, Djimon Hounsou is good as always, the look of the film is unique and the fight scenes are pretty darn good. Unfortunately the plot is predictable the characters are one dimensional, there is a girl cause there has to be, right and it attempts to send a message and fails horribly. I think the directors theory is fill the film with fight scenes and loud music montages and then you don't have to have character development or to much of their crappy dialogue. So I guess that helps the film instead of hurting it.",6,35,64,29 July 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," (- Scarlett = Success)
","Far from Woody Allen's best, with that said I am far from sold on Scarlett Johansson. In my opinion she has been very lucky to work with good directors and be surrounded by great actors. In this film she is completely out shined by both Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, more so then any of her previous films. All I could think during this film is how a movie about Bardem and Cruz's characters would be way more interesting and at the same time spare me from Scarlet Johansson and her winy voice and sub par acting skill. Woody Allen is known for his quick, witty and intelligent dialog and most the time throughout this film it's present and promising, except of course when Johansson makes her attempt at it. The dialog does not sound at all convincing coming out of her mouth, it is as if she has no clue what she is saying and how her character should be delivering her lines. Not to mention the fact that her character doesn't even seem smart enough to talk the way she does. In another Allen film, Matchpoint, her part was to play the sexy, alluring and tempting girl, so natural that comes easy to her, but here she stands out like a sore thumb. Anyway back to the film itself, about three times this film feels completely Woody Allen, the characters are smart, witty and very interesting. Then later they turn winy, self obsessed and just plain boring in there search to find the meaning of love. Blah.",7,0,4,22 September 2008
