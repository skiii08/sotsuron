The New World," Natureza
","This is another Malick film in which the nature of man and nature of God are confronted. The suffering and ambition of men who destroy the purity and sincerity of a free people. This is not a war movie. It's a movie of God and men. Terrence Malick is a master at deciphering the deepest human anxieties and questions. The philosophy of life, especially life connected to nature is his context, and God is his quest. His films are always for me a reason for great reflection about my life and my motivations. This is not a movie to mediocre audiences, which, unfortunately, are the majority. This is a great reflex of human alienation today, exposed by the deficient capacity of understanding and reflection.",10,0,1,5 May 2012
