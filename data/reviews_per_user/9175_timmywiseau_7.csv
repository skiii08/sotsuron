Minority Report," Great for its time
",Weird watching the trailer back after so long. I remember really enjoying this film. Had a real noir-esque feel as a scifi film with a deeper message. I'll definitely watch it again.,8,0,0,4 October 2018
The Fifth Element," SO MUCH FUN!
","I watch this film over and over - ok yes it has its corny moments, but it fits with the style of the film. Really good, comical moments interspersed with a deeper message, romance, action and drama. Bruce Willis' best IMO. Check it out.",9,2,2,4 October 2018
Forrest Gump," Jennyyyyy
",I love this film. TOM HANKS is a total master and chameleon when it comes to acting. I loved him in this film. You'll cry and laugh and cringe all at once. Run Forrrrressttt run!,10,0,1,4 October 2018
American Psycho," DISTURBING
","It's a messed up film that will have you wondering how much more it can get messed up by the end. It's disturbing to watch but you really start to see other people you know in the protagonist, it's scary! Bale pulls off the narcissistic psychopath so well. CHECK IT OUT!!",9,2,2,4 October 2018
28 Days Later...," THE BEST horror film
",I've never been so on the edge of my seat as I have in this film. The director does a great job at making you feel like you're in a dystopian world overrun by a zombie-causing virus. CHECK IT !!!!!,10,0,3,4 October 2018
Looper," Wasn't enthralled
","I watched this film with my GF at the time. It was so ordinary and never climaxed. Not Bruce's best work, and I'm a huge fan. Also, my GF and I broke up after.",5,5,8,4 October 2018
V for Vendetta," So good
",I love dark vigilante films and this one takes the cake! Hugo Weaving is magnificent in this. It's one of the most unique films of the 21st century!,9,7,9,4 October 2018
