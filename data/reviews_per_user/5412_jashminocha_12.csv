The Irishman," Masterclass in acting and directing... hats off....
","3 and a half hours of De niro, Pesci and pacino ina film directed by Scorsese... what is there to say.. it's magnificent, cinematic wonder.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Here goes my childhood................
","I wanted this movie to be good, at lest memorable.. I only truly cared about 4 things that came this year, endgame, joker, game of throne and this.. truly wanted this movie to be good.. to be perfect.. because it was ending the biggest movie saga of all time, the emotions and memories attached to this saga was extremely high. There was no way that this movie was gonna please all the nerd fandom from fans and critics but if marvel can pull off, star wars can also... that was the assumption. But what happened... the movie is utter garbage... which ruined my childhood.
it's not just fanboy ranting, there are good things about this movie as well as things i did not wanted to see like ever..
lets start with the good things:
1. John williams score-- which was just awesome, it gave me shivers and filled me with nostalgia..
2. Babu frik: i dont think i have to say anything more than his name... he is awesome.. just excellent...
3. acting: the acting was spot on especially adam driver's
4. Nostalgia : Watching my favorite characters again gave me chills, weather it;s harrison ford or mark hamil or carrie fischer or lando or even the emperor himself. it was just awesomenow the part which i don't want to watch like ever
1. nostalgia and fan service- I'm generally fine with fan service that is done right but here, it's not even service it's garbage.. it's like a toddler throwing things around.... and this makes the movie like a cash grab
and i believe this franchise is more than just cash grab..
with the death of this trilogy.. my childhood died with despair...
thanks disney for this cluster of a movie",3,1,1,24 December 2019

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A true auteur
","Quentin Tarantino is a genius. Once a upon a time in hollywood takes advantage of it's bankable and supremely talented actors. The chemistry between Leo and Brad, combination with Tarantino's intelligent writing and amazing camera work, makes it a unique and creative experience. The movie banks on it's extra ordinary star, especially brad, who is just amazing. The final act is one of the tarantino's best pay off ever filmed.",9,2,4,21 November 2019
1917," Riveting, hauntingly beautiful and mesmerizing
","The entire movie made to look like it's shot at one single take, this is possible because of extraordinary talented 14 times Academy Award nominee cinematographer Roger Deakins. This man is a genius, the movie is shot beautifully. it is mesmerizing to a watch world war 1 movie like it is happening right in front of you. The pacing is phenomenal. The only real flaw in the movie is that there are no great character building movements like other war movies but that is also intentional because, the main intention or motive is to save lives and not focus on characters in the movie and that works.",9,250,427,4 December 2019
Pulp Fiction," One of the most impactful, entertaining and mesmerizing movies i have ever seen in my life
","Pulp fiction is a type of movie which makes a strong argument for the case that cinema is both art and entertainment. Pulp fiction is a highly entertaining movie filled with extra ordinary performances, talented actors and a very intelligent script. That's not to say that it is not an artistic cinema, today, the movie stands as one of the greatest movie ever made. With non linear narrative, powerful performances, excellent score and memorable dialogues which will stay with u forever, pulp fiction qualifies the rigorous beauty that is cinema..",9,4,8,21 November 2019
Joker," A true Masterpiece
","A modern Neo-noir crime drama which begs the philosophical question of acceptance in the society and dares to ask hard question on the role society plays in the making of a criminal.

Jojo Rabbit," Fantastic and urgent need for such film making
","Taika Waititi's latest creation delivers what i consider is a masterpiece. Incredible, fantastic and moving performances delivered by phenomenal actors on screen which will stay with u for a long time. The movie by no means try to preach or deliver a message. What it is trying is to bring about is foolishness of Nazism or Hitler. The movie in no way is trying to ridicule the atrocities of the second world war but it tries to ridicule the concept of hate or Nazism by the means of satire. Taika uses satire to tackle or visualizes the atrocities committed by Nazi. The best way to deal with grief is Satire....",8,1,4,21 November 2019
