Requiem for a Dream," Technically good but... is it really needed?
","Drugs are terrible, that much is common sense. The terrible reality of drug use is something that is commonly shown and talked about everywhere nowadays, being necessary in order to stop the newer generations from giving in to them like the idiots from the past decades.Among the many documentaries, special programs and propaganda (not in a bad use of the word) done to spread the knowledge of this drug disease, Darren Aronofsky came out with 'Requiem for a Dream'. A powerful film that showcases the suffering of drug addicts, not leaving out how dirty and almost inhuman such a reality is. Maybe the saddest is that shown by an old woman, who abuses diet pills (abuse of legal drugs are often forgotten or not mentioned, sadly).There is quite good to say of the film in a technical aspect. The interesting visuals add to the gloomy atmosphere, and one can see Aronofsky was not afraid to experiment with his camera work. At times he makes us see things in a blurry way, almost as if hallucinating like his characters. The soundtrack is also excellent.But, WAS ALL OF THIS NEEDED?While Aronofsky DID a powerful film, I have to question why was this needed; or even if it succeeds. There is nothing here that hasn't been covered and shown thousands of times in documentaries or advertising, both before and after this film was released. I can understand the argument that 'many people don't see documentaries, so showing this on a film will reach many more!', but even then this film fails. A person who is not interested in documentaries or more artistically focused films, will it have the patience or taste for a film like this? Most people see films for entertainment, no matter what 'artists' think. The people who look for art in films are the same who would enjoy a documentary on the subject matter; someone who only wants entertainment will promptly dismiss something as this, especially since it looks to repulse rather than attract. I had a lot of friends actually say they didn't watch 'Requiem for a Dream', or say it was rubbish, exactly because of that.'Requiem for a Dream' isn't even a groundbreaking in-depth analysis of the drug subject, making it inferior in that aspect to most of the abundant anti-drug propaganda; at the same time, it holds no entertainment value in order to reach the 'common' people. To actually reach a bigger audience with such a repulsively strong subject, a better approach would be to include something to attract. Something to balance things. Like Danny Boyle did in his not-as-serious drug film, 'Trainspotting'. But Aronofsky does nothing of that.I must say I wasn't very thrilled with the acting. They did their part visually, looking ghastly as the addiction grew; however, they indulged themselves too much on the usual junkie clichés. There are more reactions and expressions junkies can do besides those usually attributed to them and shown in here. Still, both Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connelly were great. Jared Leto didn't peak my interest, maybe because he played the kind of junkie that not only I can't bring myself to sympathize with, but that makes me feel he deserves what is happening to them. Marlon Wayans is out-of-place in such a serious movie.Despite being a visually powerful and well-made film on a strong subject, I must say 'Requiem for a Dream' ultimately fails for lacking any entertainment value. It seeks to repulse far too much, and for the audience it might appeal to it will inevitably be less worthwhile than one of the hundreds of documentaries out there.",3,1,2,27 July 2013
Monty Python's Life of Brian," The greatest comedy ever
","Possibly Monty Python's greatest work, 'Life of Brian' is a much controversial parody of Christianity. Brian, the main character, is born on the stable next door to Jesus; he joins an anti-Roman organization and ends up mistaken as a Messiah. From Jesus sermon on the mount all the way to crucifixion, many moments of Brian's life parallels those of Christ's.This movie is a rare combination of laugh-out-loud silly comedy, and highly intelligent satire; something only Monty Python knew how to do effectively. There's nearly no scene where jokes are not made, and yet the narrative flows perfectly. The Pythons are marvelous as always, with special mention to Terry Jones as Brian's mother (he was always at his best doing female characters), Graham Chapman as Brian, and Eric Idle in pretty much all of his roles.As a catholic, I had no trouble with the film. I'm not the church-going type, but I'm a firm believer in God, Jesus, Mary and the saints; yet, I have no problem with religious satire as long as it is smart and not just senselessly offensive. In truth, some of the funniest bits are exactly those revolving around Brian's following once he is mistaken as a prophet (and even HOW this mistake happened). People sanctifying everything of his, their extremist belief, his 'miracles', and their attacking at 'unbelievers'... It is hilarious, yet not wrong or unreal at all! Just the fact so many extremists got angry at the film and the whole controversy it caused are proof of the Pythons' point.Another great thing was the political satire in this. The whole (sub)plot about the anti-Roman activism was hilariously well done, and quite a jab at all the left-leaning 'revolutionaries' and 'freedom fighters' from all around the world. The altercation between the leader (John Cleese) and Stan/'Loretta' (Eric Idle), as well as a later meeting between the members (with the iconic 'What did the Romans ever do to us?' discussion) are memorable.Other remarkable moments: the animated (by Terry Gilliam) title sequence, the stoning, and the crucifixion. The ending, with Eric Idle singing 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life', is great.",10,2,6,28 July 2013
Coraline," Darker animation the way Tim Burton would like
","I've heard of this film for a long while, but never had interest in watching. Only yesterday, with nothing else to do, I ended up seeing this story about Coraline, a young girl who feels ignored by her parents and enters a new world where apparently everything is perfect, the way she would like her world to be. But appearances can deceive...'Coraline' is far darker than your usual animated film. There is the distinct feel of a Tim Burton story and that is no coincidence: while he himself had nothing to do with this film, Henry Selick, who worked with him in 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach', is the one behind 'Coraline'.Unlike those two films, though, 'Coraline' actually managed to captivate me to an extent. The animation is faultless, and the story is deceptively dark yet charming. There is a good diversity of characters who are mostly very well thought-out, even if they tend to get too goofy once in a while (plus the rather pointless inclusion of Wybie, who does little for the film).Most children will not understand, or even notice, some of the darker implications the plot contains; meaning it can be enjoyed by both adults and children alike.",7,0,0,30 July 2013
The Hunger Games," Entertaining on its own, weak compared to the book
","In a futuristic world the former USA is now Panem, which is divided between the Capitol (who governs it) and the 13 Districts. At some point a revolt broke between against the Capitol, resulting in the destruction of the 13th District and the start of the Hunger Games, in which a male and a female teenager from each district is thrust into an arena and forced to fight to the death like modern gladiators: a constant reminder of the Capitol's power. The story follows the couple from District 12, Katniss and Peeta in the 74th Hunger Games.First of all, I have to point out that the book is told from Katniss' point-of-view.The change they made in narrative hurts a lot the movie, as it makes no effort to try and find an alternative. It took away a lot of the emotional depth, lacking Katniss' emotional turmoil at the arena, her conflict regards her own emotions towards Peeta and her observations regarding what's happening around her. The tributes, too, are less developed and Katniss' relationship with some (the District 11 ones especially) is somewhat more shallow; making it so we don't connect with them as much as we do in the novel.It also takes alway much of the political and social insight on the Capitol and the Districts, which is the books' greatest intelligence. They left out many concepts such as the Avox and the Capitol's exploitation of the Districts. Their caricature of our world, both present and past, is what makes the 'Hunger Games' more than just a normal teenager novel and makes it thought-provoking too.Now, what the movie did. The shaky cam, the director's 'answer' to the POV, not only fails at its goal but also takes from the actual movie-goers entertainment. The whole character development is almost null, they totally changed Haymitch's character (in the book, he is pretty much a self-destructive drunkard which is caused by everything he witnessed in the past as a former tribute and mentor in the games) and Peeta's actor was just terrible (I didn't like Peeta in the books either, but he was a lot better than this).For the good: Jennifer Lawrence is wonderfully cast; she does a very good Katniss and actually tries to convey the internal turmoil of her character despite the problems the adaptations offers. Effie Trinket was really well-done, Donald Sutherland (despite the small role) is ideal for transmitting President Snow's eerily calm and manipulative nature (which will be seen more in the sequels), and I liked how they expanded on Seneca, who was almost non-existent in the novel. The action scenes, while short and slightly impaired by the shaky cam, are still well-done; and Rue's death, while not as impacting as in the novel, is still a touching moment (the addition of the rebellion was a nice touch too, foreshadowing some of the sequel's events).The visuals are good as they managed to capture the right imagery for the Capitol and the District 12, as well as their inhabitants.Conclusion: The movie is still tense and a lot of fun to watch. It's a very flawed adaptation, and the book's fans will probably not like it very much, but as a stand-alone it's well worth a watch.",6,1,4,8 August 2012
Superbad," Much better than the usual teen comedy
","I always heard a lot of buzz about 'Superbad', apparently one of the best teen comedies of the last few years. Yet, as pretty much every film in that genre, the plot is merely a bunch of teens obsessing over partying, alcohol and sex (no drugs this time around, thankfully). How could this be any different?I finally saw this film, and it was a somewhat pleasant surprise. The dialogue is the true highlight here: it is not forced, flowing easily and being funny without trying hard (Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are often hit-or-miss, and in here they succeed more often than not). It manages to be crude at times without upsetting, particularly in the cop scenes; however, some of the buddy dialogue between Jonah Hill and Michael Cera towards the end tends to get overly sappy and not funny at all. There is not too much buffoonery like in 'American Pie' or other teen comedies (thankfully); even when there is, it is rarely overdone and tends to be overshadowed by the witty comedic remarks that accompany it.The cast is mostly good. Having known the actors from their more recent films, I knew a bit what to expect. Michael Cera (whose acting capacity seems reduced to awkward teenagers, and not fun ones at that) wasn't good, but actually very irritating. Jonah Hill was surprisingly funny as a stereotypical tough-wannabee nerdy guy, and actually compensates for Cera (strange how Cera got all the buzz for 'Superbad', though considering how pretentious Hill ended up now him receiving it could have been worse). He also makes for some rather funny visual gags.Christopher Mintz-Plasse is the one true stand-out from the cast (making it more surprising how he is the one with the weakest post-'Superbad' career), and the whole police spoof (cops played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) was hilarious (even the visual gags where good); the best part of the film to me. Emma Stone is excellent too, one of the few who managed make it big while keeping her talent, while the other girls (Martha MacIsaac and Aviva) make the little screen time they have be very worthy.Easily one of the best teen comedies I've ever seen, it is good to see some of these actors before they made it big. The easy, laid-back and unforced dialogue by a mostly very funny cast is what makes this stand out.",7,0,1,8 September 2013
The Village," An excellent concept wasted in a boring and dull soap opera
","Typical of M. Night Shyamalan, 'The Village' is a film that tries to create a solid story in order to hit the viewer with a clever twist that totally changes the perception of the story you just saw.In here we are introduced to an isolated village, which maintains itself thanks to a pact with the creatures who inhabit the surrounding woods. But when one young villager proposes to cross the woods to find medical supplies, the creatures start to act up...The twist, whether you expected it or not, is very clever. It is easily the best thing in the entire movie; however, it becomes almost ridiculous and laughable when put it together with everything that led up to it.'The Village' is slow, boring, and visually dull. The dialogue is terribly written, seeming more like a bad soap opera than a period film, and the acting is horrible. Adrien Brody is nothing more than an irritating caricature of the village idiot, acting like a retarded clown and destroying any and all scenes he is on. Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard have no chemistry whatsoever, and their scenes together are cringe-worthy; even separated, Phoenix is apathetic most of the film and Howard seems to forget her character is blind from time to time. William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are merely decent.There is no atmosphere to go along with Shyamalan's tries at creating thrills. There are a lot of glaring logic problems, too: Shyamalan forces his characters to make nonsense decisions/actions, and sometimes disregard logic in order for some plot elements to work. The fact this is meant to be an allegory for terrorism or whatever (sincerely, some people look too far in order to justify crap) only makes this somewhat laughable.This had the potential to be excellent, but ended up as a complete bore. The twist, the excellent soundtrack (one of the best I can remember of) and the way 'Scary Movie 4' spoofed it are the only favorable things I can think of in regards to Shyamalan's 'The Village'.",4,4,8,12 August 2013
The Shining," A masterpiece like only Kubrick could make
","A writer accepts the job of caretaker in a hotel during the winter, when it's closed to the public. Alone in there with only his wife and his (apparently psychic) child, he slowly falls for the influence of the hotel's ghosts, specially the former caretaker who murdered his entire family in a surge of madness...The Shining was a Stephen King novel published in 1977, and often regarded as one of the best horror novels. I'm not a fan of King, though, and I highly disagree with that opinion: I've read it, and thought it was a mediocre story, with absurd twists and so full of King's favorite clichés that one could easily predict what happened next. King criticized the movie a lot, saying Kubrick didn't understand horror. How ironic that the movie improves so much the story's idea.Kubrick did major changes in the story. Whereas the novel was a straight-up ghost story, the movie is a psychological tale of madness. We are treated with Jack's slow decent in that realm in such a way that we too feel like we are experiencing this: the numerous long shots, the feeling of emptiness from the big but empty hotel, the passage of time and the realization of how little one can do in there alone... It's easy to feel that Jack is slowly snapping from it all.If anything, the ghost aspect of the story is highly ambiguous: is Jack really being influenced by the paranormal, or is he just going mad? The fact no one else see the ghosts, only when they too snap from the pressure, also puts in question this. That's where lies the movie's true strength: it plays with us, play with what we believe we are seeing. Can we truly trust what we are shown?The choice of location was nice; such a big place creates such a sense of emptiness, it's scary. Kubrick, as shown with '2001' or 'A Clockwork Orange', is unsurpassed when it comes to creating an eerie atmosphere, which he further accentuates with his choice of music (which doubles as being very nice to the ears). There's always that impending sense of dread, the feeling that something bad is going to happen whenever a character turns a corner in the hotel corridors.The acting is perfect, something one can only achieve when working with Kubrick. Jack Nicholson is on familiar terrain, playing a crazy man; however, he truly does the part of the slow decent into madness with a high degree of realism. His performance is one of the best I've ever seen, from him and from anyone else. Shelley Duvall, too; she is a good actress and she truly brings to life her character's fragility and distress throughout the movie. Scatman Crothers and Danny Lloyd, the two other major players in this story, as well as the ghosts, are also very good.Saying this is a good movie is a severe understatement. This is my favorite Stanley Kubrick film, one of my favorite films ever, and possibly the greatest horror ever. Stephen King should feel honored that Kubrick did such a great job based on his idea.",10,3,5,24 June 2013
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Visually excellent book adaptation; a darker turn for the series
","The third film of the 'Harry Potter' franchise, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is a very good fantasy film dealing with wizardry (though, if you are to watch this, you already know what 'Harry Potter' is about). With the change in direction, this film marks a deviation from the more childish style of Chris Columbus first two films, with a darker, more sinister tone employed by Alfonso Cuaron.Following their tradition, however, HP3 is visually terrific and has excellent special effects; in addition to Hogwarts enchanting visage, we now also have the Hogsmeade village to thank for the good photography. Also, much more of Hogwarts is explored now too; even in the books it feels as if we know very little of the place, despite all that happens.The creatures, like Buckbeak and the wraith-like Dementors, bring an eerie brilliance to the screen whenever they appear. Some of their appearances late in the film are great to watch; actually, most of the late portion of the film is excellent.The adult cast is excellent. Michael Gambon respectfully stands to the task of substituting Richard Harris, and both David Thewlis and Gary Oldman (excellent casting choices, by the way) shine in their scenes. The returners from the first two (Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Richard Griffiths and Robbie Coltrane, among others) also bring good performances again. Alan Rickman, in special, is excellent; his interactions with Thewlis are some of the movie's best. Emma Thompson is also present now, though she adds little (her character was one of the least interesting to me, and her acting was rather uneventful).The younger cast is the same as before, though admittedly more mature (keeping to the tone of the film). Emma Watson is excellent as a more serious Hermione, a truly promising actress; Rupert Grint is likable and funny, truly capturing the book's image of Ron; and Tom Felton does a good job as Draco (the character's flaws are the same as the books, nothing he could correct).I am not as sure of Daniel Radcliffe, though. He is more mature, and by now it's difficult to think of Harry without thinking of him as the character, but he still lacks a lot in the acting department. There are many good moments that end up lacking in the emotional aspect thanks to his weak acting; he never makes it work on sad, emotional scenes (when he is supposed to be crying, for example), and his facial expressions are often too overdone to the point of hilarity.'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is a remarkable screen adaptation that knows how to play the book's strengths while keeping true to its source (though unfortunately also keeping the book's weaknesses). Knowledge of the first two films/books of the franchise is needed, yes, but that is no problem as the franchise is a very enjoyable one.",8,0,1,14 August 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A lackluster return to Middle-Earth
","For a long while Tolkien's work was deemed almost unfilmable. Yet, anyone who has seen 'The Lord of the Rings' knows this maxim is not true anymore. Peter Jackson did an excellent job in bringing to life Tolkien's masterpiece, so he decided to go back and also do his other introductory work: 'The Hobbit', an adventure that kinda sets up the events for the LotR adventure.Yet, this time around Jackson didn't manage the same amount of success.'The Hobbit' was already much more light-hearted, quasi-comedic in relation to its sequel, but 'An Unexpected Journey' goes a bit farther than needed. Far too much buffoonery, specially in its overlong introduction of the characters. Overlong introduction which, by the way, describes two points of my complaints against this.Like with 'Fellowship of the Ring', this ends up as mostly an introductory chapter. This is comprehensible, as most of these characters weren't even on the LotR films; still, while 'Fellowship' introduced and made sure to give each character an uniqueness, 'Journey' does not. The company of dwarfs are mostly personality-less; other than Thorin and the old dwarf, all others end up as mere background characters to the point it is not worthy (nor necessary) trying to remember their names. The addition of even more plot elements, some of which weren't even in the book, also hurts this a lot.Another problem is its length. Unlike LotR, 'The Hobit' is not big enough to warrant a trilogy (maybe two-parts, but not three). As such, Jackson has to make the film move at a snail's pace, dragging events and scenes far too long; at times, it makes what could have been a good scene boring and/or lose its impact/importance. Its terrible pace is such, this movie is almost 3-hour long when it could have been told and finished in mere 2-hours.Not only that, Jackson (or possibly Guillermo Del Toro, who was originally the one to do the script) litters the film with unnecessary scenes/plots not from its original source. They still keep to the nature of Tolkien's world, true, like the bit with Radagast and the whole Orc plot line, but they are overtly unnecessary. Like when he did LotR, Peter Jackson seems insecure of his storytelling and public's reaction to it, and forcefully changes the source material to seem more 'mainstream' and 'attractive' to audiences.As a result of its terrible pace and changes, the film drags on too much and takes away from the enjoyment, from the magic of Tolkien's mythos.The film is still good, despite those flaws. It still retains the incredible visual quality of the LotR trilogy, which helps making its pace somewhat bearable; still, as good as its effects are, at points it feels like it is dragging on purposefully to show off them (ie.: the 'mountain fighting' scene, which was kinda ridiculous). The casting is great as well: not only the returners from LotR (Ian McKellen once again steals the show as Gandalf, and we also get Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett and even Andy Serkis as Gollum), but Martin Freeman is excellent as Bilbo (in special, his altercation with Gollum) and Richard Armitage as Thorin.The action and adventure aspects of the story are very good and the film still is entertaining, though very far from 'Lord of the Rings' level. Tolkien's characters and fantasy world is always good to watch, and Peter Jackson (despite all his insecurities) truly knows how to capture it in all its visual splendor; however, the film itself drags on to the point of boredom thanks to its horrendous pacing and the whole deviancy from the original storyline proves not only unneeded, but might actually put off the more rabid Tolkien followers.",6,2,5,29 March 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson's best so far, though that is not saying much
","A kind of flashback-inside-a-flashback, where we first get an aged writer (Tom Wilkinson) recalling his younger self (Jude Law) meeting with the important Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham); then, another flashback (this one the movie) of Zero's youth working in the hotel under Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) and eventually inheriting it.This is Wes Anderson's usual farce of a 'comedy', where he tries to be amusing or quirky, with a big meaningful cast even in the smallest of roles, colorful visual and 'hip' soundtracks. As usual, this is a matter of 'style': you are either the artsy type who glorifies him as one of modern cinema's finest or, like me, sees him as a pretentious hack.Like in all his previous films, such as 'Rushmore' and 'Moonrise Kingdom', Anderson's style annoys me. He attempts to be 'different' in a sense, trying to force a quirky feel to his movies that only ends up making his characters and plot lines feel forced and unrealistic, almost cartoonish, to the point halfway through the film they might get unbearable. His entire 'trademarks' (character presentation, chapter separation, reaction shots) are interesting ideas, but he tries to be so fancy doing that that it becomes... Cheesy? 'The Grand Hotel Budapest' is no different. The plot develops nicely, but by the end it is so pointlessly complicated it's not even funny. Characters come and go for seconds, so much you have to wonder why cast names like Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Ed Norton or Jude Law for cameo- like minor roles. Just to add to the poster? At least his more irritating casting choices (Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton) also get the same cameo-esque treatment (i.e..: they are almost inexistent in here).Among the actors that get more screen time Ralph Fiennes does a very good job, though his accent distracts a bit. Jeff Goldblum, Saoirse Ronan and Willem Dafoe are also good to watch, while Adrien Brody is atrocious as usual; Tony Revolori (the young Zero) is quite inconsistent, though his scenes with Fiennes are usually good.The scenarios are beautiful, that is undeniable. But even that is not enough to compensate for all its shortcomings. Some scenes, like the whole mountain chase, felt like a failed attempt at recreating a Looney Tunes sketch.In other words, this is the same old Wes Anderson formula made slightly more bearable. Fans of his style will get the usual 'fun' they find in it, while anyone else should be free to avoid it. Truth be told, I only watched it because of its unusually high rating.",5,4,7,17 June 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," An horror comedy/parody that works
","'Tucker & Dale vs Evil' is a really good satire of the hillbilly subgenre of horror films. In this subgenre, we often find ourselves with psycho, often inbred, serial-killing rednecks chasing young people in the woods (i.e..: 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'). In 'Tucker & Dale', the title characters are actually good guys on a vacation, who are targeted by young college kids who mistake them as stereotypical psychos.The premise works just like one would expect after thinking it over. Very funny, full of references to the subgenre, death scenes that really pay off, but its quality starts dropping after a while. It needs to rely too much on comedy-of-errors and coincidences, plot devices that end up being recycled/repeated to the point of getting tired. By the time it ends, it got too repetitive to work as well as it did near its beginning.Yet, despite its predictable unsustainability, the final product is so well executed it takes a long while for the quality drop; the main duo, Alan Tudyk (Tucker) and Tyler Labine (Dale), are excellent and one of the mains reasons this happens, being both very likable and funny as the straight-mans.The character of Chad (Jesse Moss; a sociopath proper boy), though a reasonable poking at a few horror clichÃ©s, is one of the weakest points of the film. Likewise, the romantic subplot between Dale and Allison (Katrina Bowden), while quite likable and even funny, tended to get a bit too sentimental in the latter portion of the film.Rather than an all-out parody, like the 'Scary Movie' franchise, 'Tucker & Dale vs Evil' bets on actual tale-telling. The premise predictably loses some power later in the film, but it still delivers nicely in a fun and satisfying way. Another complaint I have is the spoiler in the title.",8,0,0,10 March 2014
Grudge Match," It came a few decades too late
","Sylvester Stallone is better remembered for playing Rocky Balboa, the underdog boxer from the Oscar-winning 'Rocky' and its subsequent franchise. Robert De Niro, among an outstanding career of many memorable characters, might be remembered firstly for his Oscar-winning performance as Jake LaMotta, a real-life boxer. Both characters and performances are noteworthy and quite consistent with real boxing.'Grudge Match' pretty much screams the question of which was best, Rocky Balboa or Jake LaMotta, by means of pitting their actors one against the other in another boxing film.The problem with this is the same that other recent Stallone films have had. It came too late. Like with Schwarzenegger in 'Escape Plan', or the other old action stars in the 'The Expendables' franchise, Stallone pits himself against another heavyweight old-timer far past the time where such pairing would truly have their impact (AKA the 80's and possibly early 90's).It doesn't help that the whole story is just an enormous walking cliché; it feels like another entry on the 'Rocky' franchise. It is not just the confrontation that is outdated, but the entire plot; their rivalry, the underdog storyline Stallone often has on his films, a father/son redemption storyline, the emotional final fight and 'tense' 'who was the winner?' finale... It has been done so many times, it is tediously predictable.The cast is quite good, though. Stallone does play a sluggish boxer well, which is pretty much why Rocky has kept going. Meanwhile, De Niro plays the same arrogant type he did with LaMotta; he is nowhere nearly as good as he was on that film, but he is still very good to watch. Alan Arkin is another really good one, playing the kind of cynical character he is often at best with; the actors playing De Niro's son and grandson are also quite good.Kim Basinger is uneventful, another point in which the film seems to have come from the 80's (where I guess she was a big thing). I didn't like Kevin Hart at all either. Being labeled as a rising comedian star, I actually thought for a moment during his first scene that it was Chris Rock: unfunny, with an irritating voice and mannerisms and hopelessly bad acting. But then, considering many of modern comedians like Jack Black, Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell, he might get far. Despite this all, I can't really be too hard on this flick. It is not meant to be serious, just a silly comedy with a interesting (at first glance) premise. It manages to be interesting at times, a lot thanks to its very good main cast, and the actual boxing scenes are good enough (plus seeing Chael Sonnen being knocked out was priceless); yet, even then, it is not a great comedy either and no moment where I can say I truly laughed out loud.Then again, considering its director and writers, 'Grudge Match' is not half-bad. Just keep low expectations, and you might even enjoy it.",4,2,4,28 March 2014
Rules of Engagement," A rare, but rather clichéd, pro-military drama
","Often, in Hollywood films, the military and its interventions overseas are slandered or shown in a negative light: it is common, today, for almost every war film to carry anti-military messages, for its soldiers to start questioning their actions and ideals and whether they are doing something good (heck, even WWII films seem to do it). That is not taking into consideration the many films involving government/military cover-ups, or flat-out abuses of power. Only action films tend to show pro-military stances today, and even then accompanied by some of the aforementioned contradictory messages.'A Few Good Men', a very good military court drama, is an example of my point. A military lawyer investigating a try at military cover-up, involving a severe (but implicitly 'common') military abuse of power? It pretty personifies what I mean about anti-military stances in today's films.'Rules of Engagement' is surprising in that it is the exact opposite of 'A Few Good Men'. A military officer is being charged for ordering fire on a group of 'civilians' during the evacuation of a Middle-Eastern US Embassy, and it is a military officer who must defend him as the government wishes to 'crucify' him to appease the world media.This is far from the kind of film you usually see today. A film that does not try to convey the idea that 'terrorism comes from the US's past actions!', like most 'liberal' directors/actors prefer to do, or that the military is just a bloodlusted organization that only wants an excuse to drop bombs everywhere. It is still the typical 'good vs evil' of Hollywood, but in a way it rarely employs.When you are a soldier, or police officer, or in any law enforcement position; when you are in the line of action, with your life in danger (of course, there is always a way to try and make such a situation subjective, which a character in the film tries to do by the way), THEN you will understand and comprehend one's actions, THEN you might criticize such actions. Criticizing what you don't know about is easy, not to say cowardly (another character says something similar to a critic at one point).Anyway, few people would agree to make a film like this. William Friedkin, a very competent and not usually biased director, is to be praised for his courage; as are, surprisingly, Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones, who tackle their roles with conviction and a good deal of quality. Both usually support the other side of the issue, so the fact they both agreed to work here and did it well is impressive. Other highlights are Bruce Greenwood and Guy Pearce.The action scenes in the beginning, when Samuel L. Jackson's character leads the Middle-Eastern operation, are good but a bit clumsy. Tommy Lee Jones steals the show for most of the film, and the courtroom confrontations with Guy Pearce are very good. However, the film more than indulges in the usual underdog, 'justice looks impossible but wins in the last second!' Hollywood cliché.This is not racist or anti-Arab at all; people are so used to the watered-down anti-terrorism Hollywood usually offers, when they see a movie being more incisive in its anti-terrorism stance they immediately cry foul (or, in this case, propaganda). It is commendable that they had the courage to make a film like this, and that they managed to make it entertaining as well.",7,1,4,13 March 2014
Sinister," Surprisingly good horror
","I went into this film knowing very little. The little description I had was that it was about a true-crime writer who, while investigating a family murder for his new book, finds a bunch of old homemade movies pointing at a bigger, serial-killer like plot. I expected another of the infamous 'lost footage' films, with the whole movie being just the homemade films (ie.: something akin to 'Cannibal Holocaust').I was wrong. Pleasantly wrong.'Sinister' is quite tense and moody, sometimes a bit too dark (I'm talking about the light here too, not just the mood), and with enough scary moments to make it work well. The plot is good and even intelligent, with the story tying up nicely any loose ends and transitioning from a seemingly 'serial-killer plot' to a supernatural horror very well; it's also without much nonsense, creating the horror feeling well without having to drag on. The cast (Ethan Hawke being the only one I recognize) is okay, but the movie doesn't really require much of them.The movie is not without its faults, though. There is something akin to a 'plot twist', but one that introduces an element that has been used too much in recent horror (see: Ringu, Kairo, their American remakes and rip-offs) to be considered original; very predictable, even. There is a fair share of clichés, from the characters downgraded intellect in key or even common situations (when the police officer comes to the house for the first time, for example), to cheap scare scenes that serve no other purpose (the many times Hawke walks through his house in the dark of the night). All in all, a good horror movie. Not going to be a classic, but stands out among the horde of crappy/idiotic horrors from the past few years, and should give anyone watching a good time.",7,5,7,12 June 2013
Jack Reacher," Tom Cruise never really disappoints when it comes to action
","After a shooting where five people are killed by an ex-Army sniper, former Army investigator Jack Reacher (played by Tom Cruise) appears in order to take justice in his hands. However, as he and the defense attorney (Rosamund Pike) investigates to be certain of the sniper's guilt, things are not as clear-cut as they seen...An action thriller rarely employs originality, and often comes with an abusive number of absurdities. Yet, it usually ends up satisfying our common taste for action-packed cinematic features, which is why the genre is still as strong as ever. 'Jack Reacher' is just like that; not original, a little more on the absurd/unrealistic side, but those are easy to overlook thanks to being very fun to watch.Despite all his crazy, fanatical, Scientologist persona in real life, Tom Cruise has made a career through sheer charisma and it shows. He is fun to watch in action, even if he is not the best actor around (and he is far from it), and his stunts are always somewhat believable. He lends much charisma to his character, and that is what makes this film work above its flaws.Werner Herzog is pretty good as a villain, even if he gets little screen time: he looks truly menacing, and you can't shake the feeling that he is going to turn into a cold-blooded maniac any moment. However, that is hardly acting: Herzog is like that, so he is pretty much playing himself. Robert Duvall plays nicely his supporting role (I didn't even know he would be in the film), and most of the other actors are quite solid.On the other hand, I found Rosamund Pike to be quite bad in here. Her facial expressions are almost comical when they need to be serious, and she barely manages to make her character work most of the time. She is somewhat attractive at times, though, which makes her somewhat acceptable.The action is quite good, if at times rushed, and the plot tries to be smarter than the average actioners through a series of twists/mysteries that feel forced at times. Overall, however, it does not disappoint in what it sets off to do.'Jack Reacher' is based on a book series, so it could end up as a new franchise. I don't really think it could work well; Cruise will probably end up replaced, and without him this is likely to fall in the same abyss that Jack Ryan did.",8,2,4,8 August 2013
Les Misérables," Watchable musical
","The classical Victor Hugo story of an ex-convict who tries to create a new life for himself, becoming a well-respected man, while trying to flee from a law-abiding policeman who refuses to believe he changed. Except done in musical style.I should begin the review by stating that I don't like musicals. They are often overly silly or flat-out bad, either for their over-the-top cheeriness (the old musical from the 40's/50's) or in their try to be dramatic/serious ('Chicago' or 'Moulin Rouge' for example). It's rare for them to have actual great music or consistently good singing voices.That said, the fact I managed to watch 'Les Misérables' with relative ease says a lot of this. It is a visually beautiful movie, managing to capture well the imagery we have of 19th century France; the very first scene of the movie was enough to sell it to me. The story is quite faithful to the book's too, which is already a great start.I felt somewhat mixed at the acting/singing. Hugh Jackman was probably a surprise to most, being more remembered for the tough 'Wolverine' character than as a dramatic actor (ie.: 'The Fountain'); still, I was quite surprised that he did a good singing. I felt he exaggerated once in a while, but nothing to stain his overall performance.Russel Crowe was maybe the highest point to me, though I have seen most people disagree. His singing was actually quite good to my ears, not giving his character a forced authority that a stronger voice would give; his authority is shown more from his posture/actions and that made him gripping to watch. His Inspector Javert was easily the character I liked the most in this, being much more humanized than every other adaptation of this story, even sympathetic, and his songs are my favorites from the movie.I didn't like the rest much. Sacha Baron Cohen is funny as always, but a terrible singer; both Amanda Seyfried and Helena Bonham Carter are awful too and their singing was almost unwatchable. I actually had to fast forward most of Seyfried's scenes. They really bring the movie down a lot.I felt Anne Hathaway was quite overrated in here. Admittedly, she does a very good acting job, conveying the pain and grief of her character very well, but she's not a very good singer; too many high pitches, and too much melodrama.The film also makes the revolution, the climax of the story, very good to watch. While undeniably left-leaning, in here the June Rebellion is an outright communist-styled revolution; inadvertently, this only made me sympathize more with the so-called 'oppressors' (like Javert) and happy when the revolution was crushed (the exact opposite of what the film was probably hoping for). The fact the rebellion's face was a preppy, not-poor liberal student only makes it better.Overall, it's a beautiful visual achievement and quite watchable, but far from great. The singing is good at points but awful at most others, and the acting is overall good. I would have preferred seeing this cast do a non-musical version of the story.",5,1,2,27 April 2013
Thor," Strangely Shakespearean superhero film; a bit rushed, but enjoyable
","'Thor' follows its eponymous protagonist, the Norse god of thunder, banished to Earth to learn humility, as his brash and arrogant attitudes provoke a war. Meanwhile, his brother Loki takes his chance to seize the Asgardian throne.Part of Marvel's attempt to create a cinematic superhero universe (the Avengers franchise), 'Thor' stands apart as the most outworldly of the bunch despite its basic banishment and redemption plot. I did not know much of the superhero beforehand, but I know a lot of Norse mythology and I felt Marvel's attempt to recreate it within a real world to be very good. The visuals of Asgard (and Jotunheim) are stunning and truly worthy of gods, whereas the effects involved in the Bifrost scenes are also wonderful.Kenneth Branagh, mostly known for his Shakespeare adaptations ('Henry V', 'Hamlet'), is quite an odd directorial choice. He brings a distinct Shakespearean feeling to this film: the Asgardian world has a distinct medieval structure, with Odin (Anthony Hopkins) in special evoking quite a lot the kings of old. Many other developments within the film reminds of 'King Lear', 'Henry V' and other Shakespeare's works, plus a very old-fashioned dialogue.The cast is partially good. Anthony Hopkins, as Odin, is capable of transmitting the regal wisdom and imperative power of his character. Chris Hemsworth is well cast as Thor as far as looks are concerned, and manages to convey well the god's personality. Tom Hiddleston shines as Loki, a delightfully machiavellian villain, and gives quite a powerful performance as the film's most complex character (surprisingly so for a superhero film). The other Asgardian characters, in special Heimdall (a controversial Idris Elba), are also very good. On the other hand, the film faces quite a bit of problem with the Earth setting. Not only is this part of the film very dull when compared to the Asgard one, the redemption part of the story is quite rushed with Thor somehow relearning his values far too fast to be believable. The rather weak performances from the human cast (Natalie Portman in particular is very bad, but Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings don't shine either) only makes the situation worse. There are some tries at humor, which doesn't work always, and some rather good action sequences.The film is mostly successful thanks to the stunning Asgard portion of the story (8/10), but it suffers from the rather poor earthly development (5/10). Overall, still quite a fun superhero film.",7,1,2,11 August 2013
The Godfather: Part III," Weaker than the first two, but that's hardly a fault
","'The Godfather' and its first sequel, 'The Godfather: Part II', are both hailed as two of the best films ever made (with the first sometimes considered the very best). A couple decades after them, it was given a proper ending/'epilogue' with 'The Godfather: Part III'.While the first two dealt with the rise of Michael Corleone, this deals with his fall. Wrecked by guilt at all his wrongdoings and his strained relationship with his ex-wife and children, he attempts to repent for his sins while also taking in his illegitimate nephew as his successor within the mafia business.As one can expect, things don't go right. A tale of betrayal, murder and power hunger unfolds.The movie retains much of the great cast of the first two. Al Pacino is great as ever playing Michael Corleone, now in a much more emotionally pained and fragile vision than the ruthless kingpin he was in the second. Diane Keaton and Talia Shire also return well (Keaton more so, while Shire does get annoying at times), and the entire supporting cast (where Eli Wallach in special shines) is great. Andy Garcia is also good, though he doesn't shine (which is made worse by the fact Robert Duvall didn't return).The film also retains the sophisticated atmosphere of the first two. And their excellent soundtrack, excellent directing and pacing, and dialogues.On the other hand, it still falls short of living up to the expectations. It ends up too continuity based; it is almost impossible to understand it well without knowledge of the first two films. A good deal of what made 'The Godfather: Part II' such a masterpiece was exactly the fact it didn't rely on the first; it could stand on its own.'The Godfather: Part III' would be a mess if you take it for itself.Another problem was Coppola's usual nepotistic tendencies. It is common of his to cast his relatives in his films, though usually in minor roles (he did that in the first two). This time he went overboard: rather than search for a new actress once Wynona Rider withdrew, he decided to cast his own daughter for the major role of Mary Corleone (Michael's daughter). She is an amateur, no wonder her acting career didn't pick up; she is still watchable, yes, but her scenes lose so much of intensity and believability she could have single-handedly sunk a lesser film.So, despite not being the masterpiece 'The Godfather' and 'The Godfather: Part II' were, 'The Godfather: Part III' is still a terrific film. It just suffers from the absurd expectations the first two generated.",8,1,2,25 June 2014
A Beautiful Mind," A good film, but a terrible biopic
","Simply put, a biopic about John Forbes Nash Jr., a mathematical genius who went on to win a Nobel Prize after years battling his many problems, including his schizophrenia.'A Beautiful Mind' is good, that much I'm not questioning. It is very engrossing, at times moving more like a thriller than a drama; likewise, the emotion actually feels natural and effective, without the usual sappiness of Hollywood dramas. The acting is superb: Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly shine here, and deserved the awards that year. Others who shone in a very good cast included Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and Paul Bettany.My complaint comes in that this is supposed to be a biography of John Nash; however, it is anything but. This is Hollywood sugar-coating at its finest: it shows Nash as a troubled individual, having to fight against his illness and overcome his own shy nature to succeed; it completes ignores his more thornier history and changes it all to make him an impossibly sympathetic person. They flat out make things up as they go for the sake of turning this into your typical 'underdog fighting against all odds', formulaic and not unlike 'Rocky' or 'Good Will Hunting' (those other two, though, do not attempt to disguise themselves under the cover of a true story).This is partially fault of Nash himself, who refused to let a biopic of him unless they took out all the 'shadier' aspects of his life, and partially of screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, who extensively makes use of emotion over actual storytelling to win over his audiences in pretty much every film he does (I know what to expect when I see his name on a film, and it is never to expect a great one).In the end 'A Beautiful Mind' is a very good film, with a great cast, and a rare one which manages to make its emotional moments effective without melodrama or cheesiness; even the more cheesy moments, like Nash's 'Nobel Prize speech' (yet another non-truth), work better here than they usually. On the other hand, being labeled as a 'true story' or as a biopic is not only misleading, but distracting for those who know Nash's real (and far more interesting) story.I never understood Hollywood when it comes to their sugarcoated biopics. If they are going to change and make things up so his lifestory can support the theme they want to, why still insist with the 'true story' label? Just to fool the viewers/critics?",7,0,3,6 August 2014
The Departed," A remarkable remake; Scorsese's return to the mafioso genre
","'The Departed' focuses on two characters: Billy Costigan (Leo DiCaprio), an undercover cop in the Boston Irish-American organized crime, and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), an undercover criminal in the Boston police department. As their actions intensify and they rise in position in their hidden roles, a hunt begins on both the police and the mafia to find the moles.The remake of the already excellent Hong Kong crime thriller 'Infernal Affairs' makes use of director Martin Scorsese's legendary aptitude for gangster films, relocating the story in order to reference the Boston organized crime scene. While still not as good as his masterpieces of the genre, like 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino', 'The Departed' is far from a stain on his filmography.As usual, the dialogue is good and flows in a very natural (and aggressive) way. The characters, likewise, are very interesting and well represented.Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon feel a lot more mature here. I still can't shake off the image they constructed by playing cheesy, lame pretty boys (and, in Damon's case, troubled lame pretty boys) in films such as 'Titanic', 'Romeo+Juliet', 'Good Will Hunting' or 'Rounders'. It takes a director of Scorsese's caliber to put them in line, and it shows. Both of them give excellent performances, and for the first time ever I sympathized with a DiCaprio character. The supporting cast is also top-notch, in special Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and Jack Nicholson; possibly his best casting choice since he last cast Robert De Niro. Possibly the weakest link of the movie, Mark Wahlberg had a bad tendency to overact at times.On the other hand, the love triangle subplot involving Vera Farmiga's character was totally unnecessary and just a waste of time; likewise, the Costello twist also served little to no purpose other than confuse the slower viewer. The cinematography, while not bad, feels too artificial (a common occurrence in his recent films) and does not convey the level of realism Scorsese's gangster films usually have.While not on the same level as his masterpieces, most likely thanks to his recent venture into larger scale works ('Gangs of New York', 'The Aviator'), 'The Departed' is Scorsese's best film in over a decade of mediocrities and a great entry in the gangster genre. Now, if he only kept doing mafia and casting high-level actors such as Nicholson and De Niro...",9,0,1,10 August 2013
Die Hard," Classic dumb action that defined a genre
","It's hard today to think of action movies and not remember 'Die Hard'. The movie changed the genre of cop action forever, and for most still remains unsurpassed within it.Tough NY cop John McClane goes to Los Angeles to visit his wife during Christmas in a try to reconcile with her. However, the building they are in is taken by terrorists, led by Hans Gruber, and it's up to McClane to stop them.It's hard not to enjoy this film. It doesn't lose much time, has great action scenes and the setting of it all happening in a building allows for very interesting confrontations and tactics from both sides. Add that to Bruce Willis' tough, charismatic and smart-mouthed performance and Alan Rickman's great debut role, and you have an enjoyable 2 hour action movie to go for.Yet, not all was good in here. It's hard to fault the main characters, true, but the opposite goes for the supporting ones. They are mostly too obnoxious, irritating or flat-out uninteresting, with the added insult of every other law-enforcing figure being made to look like an utter idiot in order to up McClane in our eyes (from the LAPD to the FBI, ESPECIALLY the FBI). The 'buddy cop' relationship was better than in most movies of its kind, thankfully, as the actor playing Al Powell was good too.Finally, comes the plot itself. This is why I call this a 'dumb action'. How many people can you find that like Die Hard just for it's plot? Few. And how many can you find that don't even remember it? Probably many. The 'twists' in the motivation of Hans Gruber are just idiotic (especially his real plan, which is so full of holes I fell from my chair laughing when it was revealed) and the plot overall is either overly simplistic in some points or just illogically stupid in order to make their characters (ESPECIALLY the FBI) 'work'. Such a lack of good plot also troubles multiple viewings of this film, as there is only so much straight action can do without a plot to back it up.Overall, it's a very fun movie to watch, and it's action sequences continue to resist the test of time. Just don't expect a deep and intelligent movie, and you will have a very enjoyable 2 hours.",7,1,3,3 March 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Yet another boring Bigelow movie
","After the success of her little Iraq war drama, the overrated and sleep-inducing Oscar winner 'The Hurt Locker', auteur Kathryn Bigelow hit the jackpot. Tired of her old silly movies like 'Point Break' or 'Blue Steel', she decided to get serious. And what a better why to do so than tackle a hot, controversial event that has been debated in this last decade: the war on terror?0030 gives us another sleep-inducing view on the hunt for bin Laden. We follow the CIA agent Maya, who pursuits the terrorist by interrogating prisoners linked to the terrorist groups. As everybody who saw the news in 2011 knows, the hunt ends up successful.Bigelow is terrible in action scenes, and manages to screw up the only 'good' part of the film. Jessica Chastain, who plays Maya, has been praised to heaven and back for her performance; I can't understand why. She is monotonous and tired looking which, while that's the point in certain moments, is rather strange in others; moreover, she is robotic in her line delivery (though, in her defense, most of her lines seem made for a robot anyway). Still, she is alright considering the character she plays: an extremely unlikable character who, in Bigelow's attempt to represent as 'broken' in a show of the effects of emotional turmoil caused by the hunt, ends up as little more than a brooding, impulsive bitch. Despite being described as a 'killer' (comment which is not elaborated upon) near the beginning of the film. she acts on her hunch in many moments, once even saying to a superior (after he points out she doesn't have proof to support her point) that he doesn't know Pakistan or Al-Qaeda like her, so he can't talk back. It baffles me how they would let someone like this kept in charge of the hunt, and even worse: follow her advice! The hunt was based on a obsessive idiot's guess!The other characters are not very far behind. The development only makes them more and more unlikable, to the point that it is mostly impossible to connect emotionally with most of them. The dialogue is horrifying: when not overly technical, it is done in such a bad way or with such a bad delivery it is cringe-worthy. And then there's the director choosing silent shots at the wrong times, at times where a dialogue would really contribute to an emotional moment or at least to character development.It's an extremely boring movie, with unlikable characters, weak dialogue and badly shot action. The last 30 minutes or so are alright, despite being badly shot; but then, you have to survive the first 2 hours, which is not worth it.The torture scenes, which have caused a lot of controversy, are not bad. They aren't as hardcore as one would image (the ones from 'Unthinkable' were stronger, for example), but I give her props for not shying away from showing them; I expect a lot of people would have left them implied only.",3,33,70,8 January 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Another fun entry for the Marvel franchise
","Two years after the events of 'The Avengers', Loki has been imprisoned in Asgard and Thor is restoring peace through the realms. As the realms are about to converge and an older-than-the-universe evil awakens again, it's up to Thor to protect his girlfriend Jane, who has the key power needed for the villain to triumph.Part of the 'Phase Two' of Marvel's cinematic universe, 'Thor: The Dark World' is the second solo adventure of superhero and Norse deity played by Chris Hemsworth. It stands strong mostly thanks to a cast that is already more used to their roles.Hemsworth, by now, has already mastered his role. He managed to find the right balance for his character, far more mature and leader-like than in his previous appearances. As before, Tom Hiddleston dominates every time he is on screen as Loki, being responsible for some of the film's best moments. Anthony Hopkins is good, but flawed; his Odin acts a bit too out of character later on, considering how he was established in the first film it is hard to believe he would get so carried away by grief and risk the entire universe for a relatively petty revenge.Earth-wise, once again the film suffers from the same problems. Natalie Portman is quite weak here (as much as in the first), which is problematic considering she has a larger role; meanwhile, Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard once again serve as nothing but a sad attempt at comic relief. Skarsgard, in particular; his character, so serious and intelligent on 'The Avengers', has been reduced to a pathetic loon that has little to do with how his character had been presented before.The plot is inventive, and the expanding on the Marvel universe was nice. The whole Dark Elves storyline was good, the villains were menacing and challenging (Christopher Eccleston and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje were very good) and the concept of the Aether, while somewhat underdeveloped, was nice. Sif and the Warriors Three, as well as Heimdall, were fun to watch if a bit underused.The special effects and action scenes were nice as always, and even without Kenneth Branagh Asgard kept the same fantastic-yet-medieval look from the first film. The final battle, with the characters moving through dimensions, was a particularly good visual feast.My main problem with the film, though, is not the weak comedic try or the underuse of certain aspects. Main problem is the fact this is an established universe where Thor is not the only hero. In 'The Avengers', it took multiple heroes (Thor amongst them) and a super-secret spy agency to stop an otherwordly invasion. In here, you have an otherwordly being, even more powerful than the one before, who is not wanting to rule the world but to DESTROY IT and ALL OF EXISTENCE... Yet Thor tackles him by himself, and ENDS UP VICTORIOUS?!Considering a 'nobody' astrophysicist like Jane (Portman) could track the dimensional rifting, wouldn't SHIELD do the same and investigate a possible threat? Where is Iron Man, who has been shown to go around the world relatively fast? It is not like no one knows what is happening, as there is a lot of people watching and filming the battle.When you consider it by itself, 'Thor: The Dark World' is a very good and fun superhero film, only dragged down by its weak attempts at humor (8/10). Franchise-wise, however, the film ends up with some plot- holes and continuity illogicality (6/10).The ending was very good, foreshadowed but not overly predictable. The mid-credits scene expands the Marvel universe further, and creates hype for their future works.",7,3,5,5 February 2014
The Purge," Originality is nice, but it doesn't always mean quality
","In the future, the USA has become almost utopia-like: crime and violence are almost nonexistent, unemployment is at 1%, economy is blooming... The motive? The purge, a 12-hour period once per year where every crime is legalized and people are allowed to (and supposed to) release their pent-up frustrations and anger by killing ('purging').Now, as original a concept as that is, there was one thing that crossed my mind as soon as it was explained: WTF IS THE SENSE IN THAT?!To let a 'law' like that pass means to throw away every ethic and moral society has ever upheld. Moreover, the results make no sense: how do you get people to follow the 12-hour rule? Why would criminals wait for AN ENTIRE YEAR for a measly 12-hour legality (ie.: what difference is there from what they always did anyway)? How is making people kill each other supposed to make the economy bloom (besides gun and security industries, of course), unemployment decrease or anything else? Society's values have downgraded enough that they willingly commit monstrosities during the Purge, but are apparently perfect for AN ENTIRE YEAR in-between?There is no way this can be viewed as a 'possible reality', or even realistic at all. As anything other than a fantasy this fails, but even as a fantasy it still has many problems.The film focuses on a security system salesman (Ethan Hawke) and his family during the night. His (stupid) son lets an injured man inside their fortified house, making them the target of a murderous cult.Right away we are introduced more idiocy. -A very idiotic, short-lived and pretty much useless subplot about the daughter's boyfriend; it has no other reason than to have a few 'teen- love' scenes. -The cultists are just your stereotypical movie psychopaths, like the ones from 'The Strangers'. The leader is an always smiling, smooth talking proper boy; combined with the almost religious tone of the group, he ends up as nothing but a typical religious fanatic leader.-The son (Max Burkholder). My God, how frustrating it was to see him. He is shown as highly intelligent, but he is responsible for everything wrong happening to the family. Why did he let the man inside and, knowing their lives (not just his, but his parent's and his sister's) depended on finding him, why did he hide him away?! Is he a savant, or did he have amnesia and not remember every other year's Purge?-Seeing as how willing the people are to accept the Purge (and, as such, throwing their moral values away), the characters actions are often contradictorily moralistic. If Hawke was so in-favor of Purge law before, why was he so unwilling to Purge himself? At best he is a hypocrite, which does not help making him likable.Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey are well cast, as far as looks goes (they play everyday normal people, and look like so); acting wise, Headey does a good job (being the closest to evoking real emotion) whereas Hawke ends up becoming just your usual action hero. Rhys Wakefield (the cultist leader) is clichè but unnerving, Edwin Hodger (the injured guy) is okay, and the children (Adelaine Kane and Max Burkholder) are far too annoying (though the fault goes more to their characters than their weak acting).The entire social commentary the movie seems to aim towards is absurd, the entire concept is original but ludicrous and illogical, the execution is weak and the final 'plot twist' is predictable (though not unbelievable). Whoever came up with that idea, or whoever sees this as anything other than fantasy, is seriously reality-challenged. Either that, or secretly a sociopath; after all, for such an idea to work it would require the entire society to be composed of sociopaths.",3,1,2,27 September 2013
300," Straight-forward, stylized action that truly delivers
","There aren't many action movie like '300'. In here, we follow the legendary battle between 300 spartan warriors, lead by King Leonidas, against the invading forces of thousands from the Persian Empire lead by Xerxes.By now, this almost mythological story has been more than debunked (there were thousands of spartans in that battle, not just the three hundred) but, unlike what many people seem to believe, the film is actually based on a comic book and not in the actual historical facts (the comic itself was only loosely based on reality). This is mostly a fantasy-action, and trying to dismiss it for its historical inaccuracy is just stupid.The movie itself is one of the strongest actioners I've seen. From what I've seen from the director, Zack Snyder ('Dawn of the Dead' remake and 'Watchmen'), I'm quite happy that he directed this; he is not the kind to shy away from the intense violence such a battle would create. The fantastic visuals of the film (a trademark of Snyder; even his dreadful 'Sucker Punch' had good visuals despite all its flaws) and the stylized way the narrative and battle choreography are done are brilliant; it brings a quasi-psychopathic satisfaction seeing the 300 fight and kill their enemies.Another high point is that the movie has something akin to a brain, despite all the violence. The dialogues between Leonidas and the Persians (the messenger at the beginning, and Xerxes later on) are very interesting and intelligently done, serving to further convey how prideful/arrogant both groups are. The political side story involving Leonidas' wife's discussions with the city/state council, trying to get the rest of Sparta to join the fight against the Persians, is also unexpectedly good.For the most part, the casting was very well done. The spartans truly look their part, a race of strong and prideful warriors; Gerard Butler, in special, has a very strong presence that truly makes him suitable to play the part as their leader. Lena Headey, who plays his wife, is beautiful to look at and the way she plays her character she not only looks worthy of a queen, but of the queen of a warrior nation.Maybe the only thing I didn't like was the casting of Rodrigo Santoro. As a fellow Brazilian, I knew him mostly from his work on soap operas: always being the pretty boy who is just there to make women swoon in a clichéd romance subplot. The fact he had to be digitally modified in order to make himself appear threatening (not just his height, but even his voice too) shows how much he was ideal for this role. Why not cast someone who was already menacing?",9,2,5,23 June 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," The Coen brothers' best film in over a decade
","The Coen brothers are really a cinema apart. They have their unique style, blending multiple genres in a way that feels natural, with an interesting cinematography that makes them easy to differentiate, (usually) great and original music and often witty dialogue/characters. Yet, I often find them polarizing: while I've loved some of their films ('Miller's Crossing', 'Barton Fink', 'The Big Lebowski'), I often found some difficult to like others.Not since 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?', over a decade ago, have I liked a Coen-directed film (except for 'True Grit', though that one doesn't feel like a Coen movie at all). In fact, I could consider 'The Ladykillers' and 'A Serious Man' among the biggest disappointments in the decade (among the worst too, at least among 'big, important' productions). Surprisingly, it was 'Inside Llewyn Davis' that peaked my interest again. This simplistic, almost pointless slice-of-life yarn about a fictional 60's washed-up folk singer doesn't look like much, but just like 'Fargo' in the 90's it is deceptively captivating. It is heavily a drama, yet with a somber humor and wit, where the characters aren't forced but actually realistic and the reason you keep watching on. Oscar Isaac is also part of the reason, being able to naturally convey a Coen character's wittiness; he is kind of a downer, yet sympathetic, and Isaac even manages to sing well.We have some good casting in here too (which became less common within the Coen's films as time passed; they've never casted as well as they did on 'Barton Fink' or 'Miller's Crossing'). John Goodman is really good on his small part, as is F. Murray Abraham in a cameo-like role and Max Casella as the bar owner. Carey Mulligan was quite cute, and her interaction with Isaac's was very fun to watch; moreover, she has a very good voice and is nice to hear sing.Adam Driver was a surprise with his deep voice, but again had little screen time. Justin Timberlake seems to be becoming quite popular lately; he sings well enough, true, but he isn't a good actor at all and makes his character look like too much of a wuss. Even if they insisted on casting a singer for the role, they could have chosen better.The songs are all original, collaboration between the Coens, their musical supervisor and sometimes Timberlake. Maybe because I like folk music, or because Isaac is a surprisingly good singer, but I loved them; coincidentally, Timberlake's 'Please Mr. Kennedy' was the only song that I didn't like at all, though he kinda repents in his other song with Mulligan.Overall, a simplistic to the point of pointlessness, but nonetheless engrossing and likable picture. Oscar Isaac is the highlight here, as are the excellent cinematography and the songs. Also worth noticing is that, as often, the Coen brothers leave a lot of references to Homer's 'Odyssey'; pay attention to the cat if you wish to get it.",8,0,0,19 March 2014
The Birds," Hitchcock makes a masterpiece Ed Wood must have been proud of
","A rich woman goes to a small coast town after a man she saw on a pet shop. Her arrival, however, coincides with strange happenings in the city as the birds gradually start attacking everyone.I was attracted by it because of its status as a 'classical horror', appearing in many listings as one of the best horror films, and the fact it's made by Alfred Hitchcock.I can't understand all the hype. Ed Wood made better films.This film is so bad, most of the 'scary' scenes actually had me laughing. No just the 'that is too silly' laugh, but the 'I almost fell out of my chair laughing' laugh; nothing short of Monty Python or Chaplin have ever made me laugh this much. I showed this film to some of my family; the adults were mostly shaking their heads and questioning how Hitchcock could have success with something like this, while the younger ones (10-14 years old) were laughing and later said it was the best comedy they ever watched.The acting is beyond amateurish, with characters mostly making faces to the camera and shrieking to convey their shock being something straight out of a bad parody. It also shocks me that Hitchcock, who always cast beautiful women like Ingrid Bergman, Vera Miles or Grace Kelly to star in his films, would cast the rather ugly Tippi Hedren. Was there no beautiful/cute blondes available? The characters are not far behind with their terrible development, being pretty much caricatures of human beings; Hedren's character being the worst offender, with her motivations or actions. They also act inexplicably dumb at times: Hedren's reaction to the birds in the school being the best example, but also the information given by the radio news. The special effects are terrible. Not just the usual background scenes, but the birds and their attacks are laughably badly done. Suspension of disbelief can only work so far; in here, the birds looked like bad puppets with the way they moved. I fell laughing at most 'attack' scenes, with the gas station one being my favorite. The fact this was Oscar-nominated is nothing short of a joke, you could find better effects in the silent era four decades before this.But the very worst of all is the story itself. Hitchcock always managed to make his stories have a degree of sense, even his most fantastic tales like 'North by Northwest'. That doesn't happen here. There is no explanation at hand, not even a hint for us to go by. Even horrors like George Romero's zombies or crap like 'The Mist' leave a hint for us to work on, to base ourselves. Hitchcock offers nothing at all. He explained that, by giving a reason, the movie would turn into science-fiction; clearly, he must either be an idiot or not understand horror at all.This is a terrible, nonsensical film that should be on par with the likes of 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' or 'Battlefield Earth'. It is as if Ed Wood himself wrote/directed/produced.",2,40,79,19 August 2013
