Blade Runner 2049," Yawnnnnnnnn
",I really don't get the positive reviews over here. Are these guys getting paid to write the reviews coz no other sane person would give this movie a good rating. The movie is way too long and every scene stretches and stretches without any reason. Could've easily been a 1.45 movie with some tight eidting and then may be it would've become bearable.,1,5,9,11 January 2018
