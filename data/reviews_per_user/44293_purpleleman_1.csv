It," Basically a Stranger Things rip off, barely scary.
","It's a complete rip off of Stranger Things. Except a clown instead of aliens. Shave Bev's head and you might as well be watching the same thing. The setting, the way it's shot, the bikes, the clothes, the group dynamics, it's all identical but less scary.The acting is good, but the story is boring and painfully slow; it shows the friends all hanging out and fighting bullies etc. but with little value to the overall feel or movie. The special effects are quite good; only one of the monsters (the painting woman with the flute) is poor quality (probably to look like a painting) and isn't frightening at all. The music was brilliant, and the opening scene was good, but after that it lost me entirely, and it was super long.Any parts where you think the main characters are in peril, they're not; they avoid being killed continuously even though apparently lots of other kids couldn't. They do stupid stuff that children who have already experienced a child eating clown would not be doing in that situation. Parents are no where to be seen. The jokes are odd; one of the young lads continuously making sex references and things, with the rest of the group rolling their eyes. Not a believable dynamic and lazy humour most of the time.Not worth a watch at all. Not a single part of it has stayed with me or made me think about it, and the fight at the end was just boring.",3,27,56,12 September 2017
