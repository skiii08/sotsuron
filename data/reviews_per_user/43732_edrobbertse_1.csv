It," Essentailly a kids movie with mild violence and foul mouthed kids
","A mayor disappointment for me .... Basically the movie revolves around a group of 13 year old kids terrorized by an evil, shape-shifting clown. They then outsmart him and beat him to a pulp with rusty iron rods. One of the weakest 'monsters' you'd ever see in a horror film, he did not even manage to kill any of the kids (except for Georgie right at the start of the film). What a weak, non-scary, idiotic clown. 
Not the worst horror film ever, but very flat, overly long and childish.Horror movie for kids or those that scare super easy. Total waste of time for real horror fans.",4,0,1,22 December 2017
