The Avengers," The Avengers Are Born
","Director Fury pulled finally together some heroic egos to face the threat of alien invasion. There were a lot of high octane scenes. The legendary Avengers had to fight themselves before defeating the enemy. Inter-Avenger fights resolved into mutual respect. New York City got destructively made over during the final scene. Agent Romanov and Iron Man made the most consistent protagonists. Captain America was torn between taking orders and trusting his Avengers. Thor played along, after some physical persuasion from Iron Man and Captain America, to deliver Asgardian justice against the evil Loki. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner started becoming a good team though Thor had to save Agent Romanov from the Hulk's confused rage. Persistence and selflessness finally prevailed over alien corruption and paralytic human fear.",8,0,2,14 June 2015
Fury," Tank Commander Caper
","Fury was as an intimate look at the memorable conclusion to the last world war. The end of this war story's atrocity became well known. Public knowledge of world war two proliferated as America's economy and educated bourgeois grew rapidly. Stories of soldiers were scarcely made public in lieu of patriotic or nationalistic gain, so humanized scripts for this depiction were profound. The jaded renegade Sgt and his rookie enlistee encountered not only the anticipated battles against Axis forces but also the natives. There was a dramatic quartering scene where the ethics and nature of victorious Allies faced the choice to plunder their conquest! 'With great power comes great responsibility' came to mind several times while watching this story.",8,4,7,24 April 2016
The Girl Next Door," Careful What You Wish For
","There was a lot of hype for this movie, and frankly the hype setup viewers for this movie's situational irony. The characters were attractive ranging from the usual suburban high school cliques to adult film producers and starlets. Eroticism and high school graduation, as a pair, always attracted attention, and this movie capitalized on this taboo reality. Having these polarized yet ancillary characters made most of this movie's humor based on the novelty of the friendships. This movie definitely illustrated the quiet kinkiness lurking in high school academics while addressing issues of moral sexual behavior. American Pie and She's All That each made boundaries within which this movie operated.",8,1,1,20 June 2015
Creed," Over-Hyped with a Few Good Moments
","This movie had few special effects. The acting was the whole point, and the script was lacking in enough brawls and romance to make this movie amazing. There were a few good fight moments during the final boxing scene. Fighting at the beginning of this movie made Creed appear to be action packed, yet watching someone practice nearly un-opposed for most of the storyline was boring. If Creed had had as many fights as Rocky did between matches, then this movie would have been good. Sylvester Stallone definitely made some easy money during this film. Boxing landmarks seemed important in this film. Increasing the action for these new characters to assume the leadership of the hallowed Phillie boxing grounds would help.",7,1,5,11 February 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Setting the Premise of Civil War
","Emily VanCamp and Chris Evans flirted modestly through an attack on subversion of the world's super powers. An intimate mind game between loyalty and power forced Captain America, Chris Evans, into alliances with a new hero, Birdman. The super-duo, the rising heroine, Emily VanCamp, and their cast of protagonists won with surprisingly little fire power. Ninja like moves from these Avengers adequately compensated for the arsenal of the heavily armed corruption infecting SHIELD. This world's most powerful defense faced falling to the irony of betrayal and the genocide of millions. Innocent people put their trust in an exuberant team of headstrong superpatriots though the cost would be a quarrelsome Civil War!",9,2,4,16 April 2016
Doctor Strange," Larger than Life
","Scott Derrickson made Doctor Strange a visual masterpiece! Art and visual effects surrounding the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's character were stunning. Chiwetel Ejiofor delivered a dramatic crescendo during this exploration of metaphysical and physical conflicts. Benedict responded with conviction, mastery, and swagger. Jon Spaihts, Scott Derrickson, and Robert Cargill interwove humor, spiritualism, and action into the smart dialogues. Tilda Swinton brilliantly delivered against Mads Mikkelsen's character. Rachel McAdams' character was more of the classic contemporary female role. Vicotria Alonso's production team, Ben Davis, and Sabrina Plisco's editing team stitched together this multi-faceted jewel spectacularly.",10,7,12,8 January 2017
Interstellar," Apocalypse Forces Innovation
",Interstellar was a science fiction movie for the space exploration enthusiasts. Anne Hathaway was a strong and smart female character. A stunningly attractive and successful female scientist in the growingly coed profession is still hard to find from the industrial sector. The quality of science behind the film's mechanisms for deep space travel and travel through a black hole appeared inadequate. There was physics illustrated in the movie through conceptually revolutionary scenes in a wormhole yet the spaceships looked contemporary. Modern NASA and private space exploration companies put the same kind of technology into space today. The movie illustrated this real disparity between the depths of science and the capacity of technology!,9,0,2,24 April 2016
American Sniper," A Biographical Eye Opener into the Life of a Hero
","Chris Kyle's character has correlated well with Clint Eastwood's savvy. The story alone grabbed attention, and this lively movie puts the 'Legend' into humbling perspective. An unsuspecting Texan has saved the day, which is the truth, this time. Illustrations of childhood moments, romance, familial responsibilities, and sacrifice have intertwined genuinely into a patriotic biography. Using slow motion during fight scenes and sniper shots would have been a Hollywood treatment of this biography. Non-fiction does limit the powers of film makers, yet opportunities there for modernized movie action without losing realism have been missed. This action packed movie's dialog, surprisingly though, carries the attitude and personality and earns empathy here.",8,26,46,10 May 2015
American Pie," Very Funny
","There were so many outtakes from everyday life in America. The house parties, the strive to get laid, the bond amongst friends, going to college, and prom all played out in one way or another for most Americans. American Pie definitely blew some scenarios out of proportion, and the result was comedic. Film makers stripped this film down to just the set and a fun script. Most of this movie relied heavily on the script with a nice setting at the end. Dialogue between couples, conversation amongst friends, and advice from parents were all simple yet smart enough to stay funny. Physical humor did make a few cameos. This movie was like a slice of every funny memory from everyone's experiences all mashed up in one pie.",10,2,2,13 June 2015
Bridge of Spies," The Pen vs The Sword
","East and West Berliners were geographically neighbors, yet forty years of geo-political disparity transmuted these people, often time lovers, into strangers. There were, contrary to popular propaganda, a few shots fired here and there. This political thriller illustrated some examples where a Soviet surface to air missile hit a state of the art US spy plane and it's pilot down in Soviet controlled East Germany. Tom Hanks conveyed the duties of prisoner exchange negotiator steadfastly. The script had copious dialogue for each facet of the multi-faceted and convergent story lines. The climatic conclusion conveyed the limits of extenuated cooperation amongst the puerile East Germans, the imperious Soviets, and the desperate US.",7,0,2,3 January 2016
Dangal," Inspirational
","Nitesh Diwari's Dangal becomes a inspirational sports drama. Fatima Sana Shaikh impersonates Geeta Phogat in this biographical film. Amir Khan plays her father, and Sanya Malhotra portrays her sister. The real life story of Geeta Phogat has created headlines in the wrestling world. India has had a weak reputation in international wrestling, and female athletes, in particular, face oppressive social taboos. Three Indian states could show the movie tax free because it resonates rich tenets of fatherhood, sisterhood, family, and determination. Amir Khan Productions and Walt Disney Pictures would spend a budget of just ~1.2 million USD and gross ~11 million USD due to the popularity!",10,2,4,29 May 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of Jarvis
",Singularity experts may like this movie. The computer program which powers the Iron Man suits becomes the centerpiece in a struggle between good and evil. Wills are tested and heros even a heroine are born. Scenes throughout this fantasy action movie reveal the consequences of mankind's decadence. A Slavic proletariat serves as the terrorists' base which the Avengers must save. Tension and distrust amongst factions of the Avengers grows to the point of Bruce Banner and Tony Stark's coupe d'etat. Uncertainty in purpose troubles Thor and romantic issues pang Bruce Branner. The good guys win this one yet the costs are taking a toll on team dynamics. Fate hinges on conflict resolution and team work in the next battle.,8,0,2,30 May 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Boreman: The Biography of High Strung C-list Stars
","The script for the movie was boring though the plot and setting were promising. Ed Norton and Brittany Murphy have had more challenging roles. Zach is always meddlesome and less verbose. If there was a set of scenes cut together from someone's GoPro backstage in Broadway, then the result may have been just as boring and more real. The internal insanity of the main character could have had more emotion. Flirting between Ed Norton and Brittany Murphy's character started dull. Internal narratives during the drama gave the audience insight into the characters' thoughts. This kind of intimacy brought out a whole dimension which reduced the nearly documentary feel and abstraction. Knowing the thoughts in some of the other characters during certain stages of the movie would have been engaging.",4,5,10,30 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Jedi vs Cosmic Despotism
","There are a lot of new characters where lineages of Jedi and rulers brim with revolution, politics, technologies, and ethics. Technologies have become larger yet more ergonomic during the brief exchanges amongst factions and the pictures from the bird's eye view. The large imperial weapon, awakening of key Jedi figures, and each fighters discovery of new skills and self-confidence seem reminiscent of 'A New Hope'; same strategy, new fighters. If this movie foreshadows relatively similar sequels of drama and action like 'A New Hope' did, then the next two movies may really squash the box office. Predictable landscapes and battle strategies remain threats to earning the kind of awe and respect which the 'A New Hope' earned. Each battle, each new Jedi, each inevitable victory for good or bad tilts the scales of justice and power and tests the innocence of the Jedi.",8,1,16,3 January 2016
Deadpool," Dead Right!!
","Watching Deadpool made child's play out of every Tony Stark exploit there ever was. The lascivious transformation of Wade Wilson into Deadpool was intertwined with flashback scenes from Wade's past. Romances, encounters with civilian low-life, and rouge organized crime organizations were all prey for Deadpool's non-chalant wrath. Knives, swords, and a repertoire of martial arts moves would present the ingredients of a quintessential hero ordinarily. Deadpool's naïve style was a mixture of aggression, romantic confidence, slapstick, and koi quick-wittedness. Not only his fists and flying kicks but also his jeering patois fended off enemies who had disturbed the hero and his girlfriend.",10,7,20,16 April 2016
The Ugly Truth," Love Between the Cynic and the Believer
","There were some authentically funny moments in this movie on the dynamic equilibrium between work's demands and love's nature. The romance between the two lead roles stayed tasteful and followed some interesting sequences. Metrics driven professional relationships, dating, romance, and comedy interplayed through the story. Most of the sets illustrated a simple, up scale, chic Sacramento lifestyle. This story's humor blended physical and verbal romantic satire and situational comedy. Katherine Heigl boldly pushed the limits of acting during an important impromptu dinner scene. She and her co-cast primarily delivered a tasteful comedy while the script's more romantic elements naturally developed.",8,1,2,14 June 2015
The Nice Guys," 1970's Mix
","Nice Guys resembled a Pulp Fiction type of vintage. Russel Crowe and Ryan Gossling suavely portrayed super sleuths. Angourie Rice delivered the role of female sidekick. Kim Basinger played another overly-controlling female character. Margaret Qualley acted as the rebellious one. Clever quips brought out the relationships among the cast. Costumes and dresses from a by-gone era, like Yaya DaCosta's dress in the climax, gave the scenes an authentic look. A soundtrack of hit musical throwbacks helped set the ambiance. Dramatic plot-twists kept the pace of the movie at par with murder mystery movies while the script integrated humor to lighten the premise. The result created a detective comedy for mature audiences!",9,6,13,24 June 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Action
","Mad action blasts away any urge to fall asleep through this movie. Car chases, explosions, combat, and babes all interplay well so boredom ceases. Scenes of bad guy fortresses, vehicles, and weapons stack the odds pretty high against Max and his new found friends. Everyone there pushes to the limit. Even little crony bad guys put up decent fights. Even one or two of the super model ladies pull a couple ones. Watching this movie in 3D just amplifies all this action, and the color choices just really brought out the Gothic post apocalyptic setting. Barren and thirsty lands seem sweltering while five peoples face scarce resources and corruption. Each group of people showcase slight competitive advantages which Mad Max's band just blows to shreds.",9,3,7,17 May 2015
Warcraft," WoW!
","Warcraft, the movie, depicted the fictional war game story in an accessible way for mainstream viewers! The 3D computer graphics and real life actors and actresses were an evolution of the cinematography from the Avatar. Duncan Jones directed the first of a promising series given the success of the 21st century sci-fi and fantasy genre with the Matrix, X-Men, and the Avengers. Help came from the advance of computer generated graphics and the growing comfort of acting with these technologies. There was plenty of action in this gamer's delight though the story line was obviously adapted for a movie audience. Warcraft's fantastic scenery and fictional conflicts manifested magically in this thriller.",10,1,2,16 June 2016
The Martian," Scientific Fiction vs Science Fiction
","The Martian is the latest in the attempts from Hollywood to make a plausible science fiction movie for the masses! There is a little science in this picture of NASA's contingencies against failed conquest of Mars. Biology, chemistry, and agriculture are the three main staples for the star studded cast of The Martian. No light speed warp drives, thugs with advanced arms, or black holes makes this survival story felicitous to the contemporary science fan. Matt Damon, the familiar brainy underdog since Goodwill Hunting, returns as an astronaut lost just a planet away from Earth. Homesteading on Mars has become the object of speculation for space fans and professionals alike, and this type of content can really help.",9,0,0,24 April 2016
Furious 7," If the Avengers Had to Drive Without Superpowers...
","There was one race scene, one convoy scene, one get away scene, and one chase scene. The first Fast and Furious had at least three or four of each. The settings have become a little more diverse with at least three different regions of the world represented. Less race scenes meant less street tuners though some of the armored mods were still innovative. Overall the attitude of the Fast and Furious saga had been toned down from careless joy rides to now saving the world! Paul Walker's death definitely changed the relationships and trust amongst the familiar cast. Most visible was the change in Vin Diesel's acting. Tony Jaa was suppressed since he could definitely beat anyone there in a martial arts contest, and any action actor was suited for Jason Statham's hyped role. Tyrese and Ludicrous were still exchanging funny insults for the babes, and Dwayne Johnson always keeps energetic and motivating.",6,3,18,30 May 2015
