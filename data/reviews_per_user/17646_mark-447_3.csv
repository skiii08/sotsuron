Sucker Punch," No matter how much you polish a turd, it's still a turd
","'No matter how much you polish a turd, it's still a turd.' That's the phrase that kept running through my mind during this excruciatingly long and boring special effects house demo reel. The premise of transporting us to a fantasy world by telling us that you're transporting us to a fantasy world just did not work for me or any of the other grumbling people in the theater where I regrettably watched this film.I wish I could give Zack Snyder a pass, and just say he did his best with what was forced upon him, but the Snyder name showed up so much in the credits that it looked like a high school art film, so he must shoulder the entire blame for this debacle.It's no wonder that 'Diary of a Wimp' was the top grossing film this week!",1,19,41,29 March 2011
Lost in Translation," Can't wait for Lost In Translation II
",It was a great half of a movie.  I can't wait for Lost In Translation II to see how the movie ENDS!COME on!  I was so disappointed by the 'end' of this movie that it almost negated all memories of the rest of it.What was this?  A prequel to 'Kill Bill?'  At least I know THAT will be only half of a movie!,Null,0,0,30 September 2003
Watchmen," In-freaking-credible!
","Just saw a sneak preview of Watchmen...Can't WAIT until it starts Friday so that I can see it again!!! Great, great, GREAT job! There were several omissions from the novel that were a little disappointing (Hopefully they'll be added in when they release the extended version on DVD)...but every second of story that was there was mesmerizing! Fans of the novel will NOT be disappointed...My only concern is that the movie may not be popular with non-readers. I brought a friend who was unfamiliar with the novel, and afterwords, he said he was lost and confused. Although, on the plus side, he said perhaps he would go buy the novel and read up on it!",9,13,28,2 March 2009
