Marie Antoinette," A Disappointment
","This movie is visually stunning but that's about all there is to recommend it. The soundtrack works really well in some parts but totally misses the mark in others. It is entirely self indulgent and BORING, much like the way Marie Antoinette comes across as portrayed by the ever-snaggletoothed Kirsten Dunst. It simply drags on and on and totally trivializes the historical events it portrays. A rare miss from the talented Sofia Coppola. I would have liked to leave it at that but IMDb has some ridiculous policy that reviews have to be 10 lines long. No wonder the other reviews I read prattled on so much. The bottom line is that this movie is boring. That's really all you need to know. Enough lines yet, IMDb?",3,1,1,19 January 2010
