Minority Report," Full of sound and fury, and signifying nothing
","I can't believe that the film I saw was the same one that IMDBers have been giving such good ratings.  While the special effects were excellent, they were often effects that made no sense, which is also true of the plot line. Two computers in the same small high-tech room more than 50 years in the future use removable media to communicate rather than being networked. Anderton (the greatly overrated Tom Cruise) could have simply hid out in the wilds for 36 hours and shown the warrant against him to be baseless rather than suffering an eye transplant and risk capture or worse to find the 'minority report' on him.  The 'precog' Agatha, Anderton, and Burgess (Max von Sydow) all admit that individuals have a choice while the latter two also insist that the future crimes are predestined -- just one of many examples of the film defying its own logic.  I could mention others, but some of the more egregious would be spoilers for those who do not heed my warning against seeing this film.",4,2,4,18 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A shadow of its predecessor
","After the wonderful job that Peter Jackson, cast, and crew did on LOTR: The Fellowship of the Rings, I eagerly looked forward to seeing The Two Towers. Unfortunately, all is not well in Middle Earth.  Much of the magic of part one of the series has vanished from part two, leaving in its wake what is for the most part a medieval epic.  There are some fantasy elements still present: Nazgul riding dragons, Treebeard, etc., but much of the film deals with the realm of men battling with swords and with arrows.  The Two Towers is, to be sure, amongst the finest medieval epics ever made, but it lacks the charm of The Fellowship.  Still, it is worth viewing and forms a necessary part of the saga that is The Lord of the Rings, and I would recommend that people who enjoyed the earlier film watch The Two Towers if only to prepare for The Return of the King -- just be prepared to take the film on its own merits, not on expectations based upon its predecessor.",7,0,0,21 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," To Quote Shakespeare ...
","'It is a tale told by an idiot -- full of sound and fury and signifying nothing.'  Luhrmann seems to be obsessed with camera and editing techniques and oddity for no particular reason.  The modern songs immediately take you out of the intended setting, and all of the glitz is just a distraction from the fact that Luhrmann and Pearce must have written the screenplay during an all-night drinking session.  Why, oh why, could they not have tried giving us the real Moulin Rouge?  It would have been much more enjoyable than this half-baked concoction.",4,0,2,12 September 2003
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Strathairn and documentary footage produce a winner
","This film was a real treat, with Strathairn's dead-on performance as legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow a sure bet for at least an Oscar nomination. Perhaps the best decision by writer-director George Clooney was to cast no one in the role of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Instead, Clooney uses actual footage of McCarthy in the HUAC hearings and press conferences. Movies based on actual historical events often sensationalize events, but the extensive use of documentary footage brings home the reality of this movie's story line.In addition to Strathairn's best performance to date, the entire cast delivers, from Clooney himself as Murrow's producer Fred Friendly, to Frank Langella as CBS chairman William Paley, to Ray Wise as the insecure anchorman Don Hollenbeck. If there is a weak point in the cast, it is Jeff Daniels, who was given little to do in the role of news director Sig Mickelson and did little with it.As most people today are acquainted with the 1950s through black-and-white images, the decision to film in black-and-white also feels appropriate, and helps the documentary footage to blend in seamlessly with the filmed actors. The only real failing of the movie is the lack of real drama. Throughout, Murrow and the gang are seen to have the upper hand, although they sweat about the potential consequences of every action. The slice of history, the ideas presented concerning the proper role of news media, and the terrific performances all more than make up for this, however, and I strongly recommend this film to those who lived through the McCarthy era and to those, such as myself, who only have witnessed it in the rear view mirror.",9,119,151,16 October 2005
Enemy at the Gates," Generally good, but with a few problems
","For the most part, I liked this film. It had a good story, based on historical people and events, some taut drama, a nice little love story on the side. It was well-shot and mostly well-acted.There are, however, a couple of significant problems with the film. First, there are the accents. Most of the actors made little effort at developing believable accents and spoke in their own accents. I could have lived with this, although some credible accents would have helped. What was really objectionable was Ron Perlman, who tried to speak with an accent, but it came out more Australian-sounding than Russian. He would have been better off just using his American accent.My other chief objection involved the climactic scene. Without delivering any spoilers, I will only say (as others have) that it seemed to have been plucked straight out of a western movie. There was not even any subtlety to that allusion, and it served no purpose in the film. My guess is that writer-director Jean-Jacques Annaud was a fan of those classic western showdown scenes and wanted to incorporate the look as a matter of style. It didn't work.Having made those objections, however, I will re-iterate that my overall impression of the film was positive. If you enjoy a good war film that is not just a 'rally round the flag' kind of glorification of war, you will probably enjoy enough to make it worth watching. Just don't expect it to be on your list of all-time greats.",7,1,3,11 October 2009
The Matrix," A thinking man's action film
","The Matrix works on many levels.  If you are simply looking for an action film, it is one of the best.  If you love great visuals, the Matrix has them.  Look beyond the surface, however, and you will find the true value of this film.  There is so much there for the intellectually curious. Discussions of this sci-fi classic lead to the question of the nature of reality, when you can truly say you know something, whether ignorance is truly bliss, potential pitfalls of technological advancement, environmental costs of war, etc.  For those familiar with Plato's Parable of the Cave, The Matrix may have particular relevance, as Neo's companions have difficulty in seeing the reality rather than the shadows.  Finally, The Matrix is also a classic Messiah tale, and references to the Biblical tales abound.It also bears mention that the story line of The Matrix has allowed the action sequences to take place in a world that not only allows you to suspend disbelief but actually encourages you to do so.  Inside the matrix, the only limits to what is possible are the limits of what your mind can conceive.  Take the red pill and enjoy the ride.",9,0,1,12 September 2003
