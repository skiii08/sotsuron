Scarface," Entertaining but biased
","Scarface contrary to some sources is not based on true events. To the best of my knowledge , I'm sure there are parallels to things that happen in the world of the Drug trade. This film is a remake of an older film by the same name. Starring the great Paul Muni. Reminiscent of the older film is the blimp bearing the writings ' The World is yours' As a Cuban-American I take issued with the way we Cuban'Americans are portrayed.To begin with the script was written by Oliver Stone, a man who has made a living putting down those of us who oppose communism. Having the likes of Stone write the script was the equivalent of of having a white supremacist write a script on black history. He (Stone) has made it clear in interviews his thoughts on anti-Castro Cuban-Americans.The film of a Cuban refugee who arrives by way of Mariel, and became disillusioned with mundane work , and goes on to become a drug kingpin, was entertaining but was it. As a former Police Officer I know that much of what happened was totally fake. that isn't the way the drug trade , and police agencies operate. Most of it was pure artistic license.A 'battalion' of hundreds of Bolivian hit men, just doesn't fly into Coral Gables Fl and proceeds to take an estate and it's occupants. Pure artistic license. The local police , and 'military authorities' may object.Entertaining but pure fiction.",6,3,7,2 April 2005
Hotel Rwanda," Realistic account
","Hotel Rwanda is perhaps one of the best films I've seen to date. The film shows how bigotry can move otherwise decent people to commit unspeakable atrocities against those who they view as different. It inversely also shows people of goodwill will challenge those who perform genocide/murder against those who they consider different and guilty of murder. Such is the case in this film. The concierge/manager of a Rwandan hotel pays bribes, pleads, and goes' as he has to in order to save innocents from genocide.Like many of us who grew us in the United States I have met many who define racial issues as a Black/White issue. Well the truth is that prejudice can bring out it's ugly head under any issue. It's up to us of goodwill to set the record straight by rejecting hate speech, and actions.This film the Hotel Rwanda should wake us all up to the pretense of evil racism, and bigotry.",9,0,1,16 February 2008
American History X," A realistic study of race relations
","This film is a great study of race relations, without resorting to the usual 'polically correct ' diatribe's.Edwards Norton (Derek in the film) makes one of his greatest performances as the son of a fireman who was killed by blacks while reporting to a fire. The trauma that his sons experience leads Derek (Edward Norton) into the path of the white supremasive movement. He becomes a skinhead who rallies other disaffected whites into a movement that rejects not only blacks but also Asians, and those of Spanish heritage. He becomes a hero to the white supremacists and organizes attacks against those he blames for his father's death.He winds up in prison for the death of several blacks who tried to either steal of damage his car. Whether those black were stealing or vandalizing car remains vague in the story line. Never-the-less he ends up in prison for three years where he learns first hand the hypocrisy of race relations. He befriends a black inmate who was mistreated by the criminal justice system, and soon reject his affiliation with the white/Aryans crowd.A commentary on this film cannot be complete without mentioning DR. Sweeney. A black professor who encourages his students to write an essay about issues of civil rights. Derek's brother writes about Mein Kampf. At about the same time Norton gets released from prison and goes about rejecting his path of hate.This is one of the best film I've watched. I highly recommend viewing this film. It'll tap into our most internal biases.",10,0,2,18 October 2007
Saw," a true psychological thriller
","I have seen many horror, and crime dramas, 'Saw' was quite unique.I found many similarities to Hannibal sequel to 'Silence of the Lambs The culprit here believes in himself as sort of an avenging spirit of sorts. picks his targets among people who at least in his demented mind are guilty of some form of wrongdoing, in one It's a botched, suicide attempt, which he feels was done only to get attention. In others It's anti-social behavior, or criminal acts.This killer, if the reader cares to indulge me in letting me clarify, is not a killer. That's right , well OK by a legal definition yes he would be considered a murderer, but his Modus operandi is to place the intended victim, in a position in which he or she must carry out certain tasks that usually result in death by the same means the victim used in committing his/hers own wrongdoing.Unlike other Horror/Crime films the police , and/or authorities play a very background role in the investigation. Most of the dialog , and scenes are between the victims themselves. Even the killer makes only brief appearances. The killer unlike Hannibal Lecter is not as resourceful, or intelligent.My summary , yes this film is worth watching.",7,2,4,22 February 2005
