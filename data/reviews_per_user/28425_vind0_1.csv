Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Wow!
","Having seen all the previous Tarantino movies, I of course was excited to see the Kill Bills. After watching Vol. 1 the first time, I was a little disappointed. (I have since watched it 2 more times and appreciate it it a lot more). Thats wasn't the case with Vol 2. It is fantastic from beginning to end. There are even a few surprises along the way and you get to see much more of Bill than in Vol. 1. He is no longer the mysterious man in the shadows, Tarantino really develops his character in part 2. Even non Tarantino fans should make an effort to see this movie. Although I don't think you would get the depth of the story from just watching Vol 2, you certainly could without be lost. It is almost a standalone movie. Another great film by a fantastic writer/director.",9,2,4,22 April 2004
