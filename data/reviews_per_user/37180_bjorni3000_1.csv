Hereditary," Makes Transylvania 6-5000 a masterpiece.
",Biggest disapointment of 2018. Nothing more to say. And glad I had Transylvania 6-5000 to watch afterwards just to forget this disastrous hyped-up crap. What the hell was this about?If you call yourself a horror-fan and give this movie a good rating you are better off watching Sesame Street and Count Chocula. This movie left me scratching my head with no scares. Who the hell is king Paimon? Who were the naked people on the loft? Why did people loose their heads? You will never know.,2,3,6,26 August 2018
