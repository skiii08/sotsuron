"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Woeful.
","First of all, I am a huge fan of the seminal series Spaced. It was, to my formative mind, as significant as This Life. Nothing much has impressed me more since then.However ..Hot Fuzz simply wasn't funny. Shaun of the Dead reminded me of a Final Year Project for a Media Studies undergrad.This latest offering is truly dire.Its not that it doesn't try to entertain, it does. It just isn't _funny_.Asinine, predictable, low brow and spun to death.Its a great great shame, but its becoming more obvious to the world that it should be Jessica getting all the plaudits not Simon. Evidently, among the entire creature genius assemble that produced Spaced, she was the one with the sense of humour.Don't waste your money on this, go watch Bourne instead.You might get this off TPB at some point in the future, when there's a dry spell in the winter. You'll wish you hadn't bothered.",1,9,98,13 September 2007
No Country for Old Men," As confused and dull as the Sheriff's ramblings.
","It had promise ..Some suspense.But by and large, it was as shambolic and dis-interesting as the Sheriffs pontification.Did it strike you as being massively up its own butt and quite probably on a lot of coke? It was Tarantino without the laughs. Or interesting characters.I mean, the assassin is scary. For five minutes. Then you realise he's just a psychopath, end of my interest. Whats interesting about a narcissistic psychopathic killer? Not a lot. He kills everyone: whoop-de f*** do.The lead character, Brolin's guy, seemed to be at once rather smart and whenever the plot called for it for continuity, incredibly stupid. That I can forgive in a crap TV show on FOX but not from these two supposedly 'genius' writer/director Bros.Then there was Woody. He appears, he shows some nous, you start to think about how its going to play out. Assassin guy kills him. D'oh. Didn't see him coming, despite being 'a pro' himself. OK. Makes sense. Not.The ending made little sense to me. More rambling, strange metaphor, bit of dust, credits. Gripping.If it was intended to be some lyrical diatribe about how the world has turned to s**, since the 'good old days' when there was 'the big plan'. I couldn't care less .. Christ you can hear that sort of naive/arrogant dross at any bustop. The world was nicer, the grass was greener, people didn't sh** on each other or kill and rape and maim for jollies. Uhuh. Those age tinted glasses everyone gets (no not glaucoma) for their 65th birthday.As for the main character, who you have followed for over an hour (much of it uninteresting and uneventful) just dying. OK. That's fine, if it works, but I just felt cheated out of an hour .. we didn't even get to see how it happened. Just cut, fade, corpse.I was really keen to see how he would manage to outwit the inevitable serial killer.Some fanboi at work sounded off today about how he represented the 'violence in humanity, as illogical and inevitable'.Clearly.Give the man an Oscar.Hell, give Tommy Lee one as well.And me.And the man who delivers my milk.Is America so starved of original, arresting (screen) culture that anything slightly surreal with a dash of nihilism and not much dialogue wins hands down? Apparently .. Fargo this ain't. Avoid like Johnathon Ross and all the other retards who think this was a tour de force.",5,4,9,8 February 2008
1408," Long. Dull. Disappointing.
","Started so well ..Then devolved (a most appropriate adjective) in to a typically Americanoid conglomerate of staged and often dated special effect snippets that leaves you yawning and wondering when all the fluff is going to end so the plot can resume. The whole set looks exactly like a set. Reminded me of the Murder She Wrote episode from circa 1987 where power pad clad Jessica's law enforcement friend (the criminally obese one) chokes to death on a twinkie in suspicious circumstances. Deep stuff.Not my all time favourite film then. But why? Well, you have a specific formula for horror movies, specifically specific if they are 'inspired by Stephen King short stories' ergo; they are gripping for the fifteen minutes or so the narrative follows the original prose, then utterly mind numbing for the proceeding two hours where a cocaine sodden Hollyrood script editor plumbed the depths of a socially retarded, sexual repressive sociopath's autobiography for material. There is no plot. There is no spoon. No wait, am I dreaming? You get me. The film drifts between genuinely scary and absurd.There is no moral tale, it reminded me certainly of a Christmas Carol (I kid you not, its that bad) for the last forty-five minutes or more, but other than that it held nothing deeper, meaningful or insightful of impressionable merit. Not even a snifter of redemption: Our character is so fundamentally dull and unlikeable, I couldn't actually see much point to any supposed supernatural divinity taking much interest in him. I know I didn't. So his daughter died? Boo hoo. Its not enough to make me care. Even his estranged wife appears to have got over it. Absurdly. Dross. Dull. Long. Slow. Staged. Corny. All suitable expletives.Please, no really, stop plagiarizing second rate novellas and invest in someone with a smidgeon of talent to pen the scripts. American film, this one most specifically, needs to steer hard a starboard. Get away from 'man in action' segments that drag on and on and focus on what the French do so well: actual humanism. Dialogue. Meaning. Inference. Mise-en-sc√®ne.Or, well, just don't and keep turning out more crap like this ..John. I tried. I did. Truly I did. Mea culpa ..",6,2,4,14 October 2007
