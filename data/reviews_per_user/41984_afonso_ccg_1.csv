Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better than the first...
","First of all i would like to say that i'm only 13 and when I saw this movie I was amazed.I saw this one before the first but then I watched them again and I can say this is by far better than the other.First the action scenes there are some but nothing compared to the ones in the first vol. being the best in this movie probably the one between The Bride and Elle Driver.One of the best moments in the movie is in my point of view the conversation between Bill and the Bride, I could say that no word is miss placed but that isn't Tarantino's style (what kind of gangsters talk about hamburgers in the car) but the overall is amazing.About the characters first you have Bill who at first sight seems a cold hearted hit-man but then you understand that's not the case and in my point of view he only did that to The Bride to see if she is worthy of taking is child and how far would she go to get revenge, like he says i'm not sadistic i'm masochistic and if he wanted to kill her he would had shot her in the middle of the eyes not in the side of the head.About Elle Driver she is probably the most 'bad' person in the movie she as no sense of honor or regret and last but not least we have Bud, Bud is probably the character with most sense of honor and he truly regrets his old life being probably the exact opposite of Elle.The soundtrack is amazing like in any Tarantino film. This is a great film and any film lover should see it. 8/10.",9,1,2,6 November 2006
