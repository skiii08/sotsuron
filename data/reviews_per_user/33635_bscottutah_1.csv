First Man," Well, that is not what I expected.
","Pros -
Good cast
Learned a few things I didn't knowCons -
Shaky cam
Extreme closeups
A lot of silent thinking scenes
La-la Land music over and over
Turned an awesome story and achievement into something depressive
It feels like a 5 hour movie
After you wake up, you wonder why you spent your time and money on this movie
There are fictional elements in movie which didn't need to be there
I movie portrays Armstrong as a weird non-hero.Suggestion - wait for a Redbox or Netflix showing, load up on the caffeine and have zero expectations and you might like the show.",3,2,4,19 October 2018
