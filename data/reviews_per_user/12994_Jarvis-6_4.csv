Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visually appealling, otherwise...
","Visually, the film is a masterpiece, and sets the standard once again for visual effects.  Even as a 17-year old raised on computer graphics, I was extraordinarily impressed with the effects - sort of the same feeling I first got when I saw the dinosaurs in Jurassic park for the first time.With so much importance placed upon this movie, it would have been impossible for it to either be a complete bomb or a total success. Unfortunately, the film seemed to me to be marketed to a larger audience than the originals, with special emphasis on kids 12 and younger.  Lucas might be an independant filmmaker, but let's face it - as much as we would like to believe otherwise, moviemaking is an industry driven by money, and I think this film suffers because of that.  Take Jar Jar Binks, for example. For me, this character represents two things: a breakthrough in computer graphics, and an attempt at comic relief that fails for people who are old enough to be cynical and critical of the character. I love the original Star Wars movies - but they have a quiet charm that Lucas either chose to ignore, or that is simply impossible to recreate in the era of fast cuts, cheap thrills, and computer animation.",Null,0,1,6 June 1999
X-Men," Surprisingly magnificent
","I'll keep this short and sweet. This is the kind of film that could've easily been a disaster.  It could've been poorly cast and acted (see Keanu Reeves in the Matrix), the dialogue could've been mindless filler (see Keanu Reeves in the Matrix), it could've been a badly edited 2 1/2 hour movie, it could've been a substance-less special effects vehicle, it could've been overly dramatic or improperly stylized, the list goes on and on. Fortunately, it was none of those things.  Instead, the director served up a tight, well thought-out, and thoroughly engrossing movie that did not take itself too seriously.  Go see it if you haven't.",Null,0,0,14 August 2000
Snatch," Boo-ya
","I have mixed feelings about this movie.  On the one hand, it is populated with very intruiguing characters and well-edited scenes; on the other hand, these scenes do not gel together into a cohesive story.  This might be attractive for the 'MTV-loving' crowd, since it appears at times to be a series of music videos.  Not to discount its 'Holy crap-teehee!' value, but I don't think this movie is as solid as something like Traffic, which hangs together much better.",7,0,0,21 January 2001
54," Not so great
","At a glance, this looked like it would be a pretty good film.  Then I started watching it.  Totally forgettable characters (except Myers), along with an unoriginal and tedious plot, combine to form a movie that tries to be Boogie Nights, but fails.  There are a few brief bright moments in the film (like a drug-addicted grandmother cutting it loose), but these hardly redeem the movie's shortcomings.  If you want a film that represents the seventies in a more captivating fashion, then rent Boogie Nights.",Null,1,1,8 March 1999
