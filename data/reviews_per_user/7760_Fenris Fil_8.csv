Sucker Punch," An exercise in futility
","The problem with this film is that for action to work you need to have an emotional investment in it. But when the action is at best a metaphor to the films reality, there is none. With no emotional investment your not on the edge of your seat and it just becomes pretty pictures.Sad really because the action itself, when not taken in the context of the film is pretty good and the films main plot is reasonable. It just doesn't work when all put together, the whole is far less then the sum of it's parts. When you start to compare the film to ones that are similar in concept, such as Pans Labyrinth or Brazil, you realise just how much this film falls short.Sure you could compliment the film for being an action film with some depth but that is to largely miss the point. The basic plot is set up quickly and the rest of the film are the long action sequences filling in the gaps and ultimately serving no purpose. The truth is the two sides work against each other and would be better served in a film of their own.",4,1,4,1 June 2011
Shaun of the Dead," Hilarious tribute to zombie films.
","Much has been made about the links to the cult English series 'Spaced', however even that aside this film is an excellent parody of the Zombie film genre. I heard that even George Romero was impressed with the way it was done. By co-incidence I've spent a lot of time this year watching classic Zombie films so they were all fresh in my mind when I watched this and it is brilliantly done. There are many clever little tributes to various films (and yes also self referential moments to the series 'Spaced' as well). Night and Dawn of the dead are referenced several times and other films such as 28 days later, Evil Dead and even the Clockwork Orange (not a Zombie film but still a classic) gets a tribute. But even that all aside I think most people will find this film thoroughly enjoyable. There are a lot of great one liners and amusing dialogue as the situation itself is hilarious. In a way it turns out to be one of the most realistic Zombie films to date due to the bumbling ineffective way the protagonist and friends deal with the situation at hand. The horror side of the film isn't skipper over either, there is a classic zombie film scene at the later end of the film where one of the gang meets his gory demise, and at various times Shaun himself has to deal deal with those close to him returning from the dead. The zombies themselves look very good and the approach of getting fans of 'Spaced' to come in as the zombie extra's has a resulted in a worryingly realistic zombie mob.Being a tribute to the classics the film features the more familiar slow, slightly silly zombies that are a menace only when they catch you by surprise or when in mass numbers (which is most of the time) rather then the fast on their feet mega aggressive zombies that are more popular these days through films such as the new (I hesitate to call it a remake) Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later. These zombies often seem quite silly when in smaller numbers and without the element of surprise and this film takes maximum advantage of that.Really I don't think this film could have been any better then it was. Despite revelling in parody and classic zombie style the film doesn't become predictable and keeps a good pace throughout. The same can't really be said for other recent zombie films I have seen. In summary, for fans of Zombie flicks it's a classic, for Spaced fans it's a magnificent and I think for everyone else it'll still be an enjoyable one to remember.This is a film definitely going into my DVD collection.",9,0,1,1 June 2004
Alexander," Forget morality, this film is about terrible casting and nightmarish pace
","Bill Hicks once pointed out that people got too wrapped up in the moral discussions about Basic Instinct to simply realise it was a very bad film. I'm seeing a very similar thing happen with this film.There have been a lot of people giving this film a 10/10 and pour a load of praise on the film in IMDb reviews. Interestingly most of the comments have been defencive rather then actually positive, and they have been far too concerned with the ethics and morals of the film rather then it's function as a piece of historically based entertainment. Any film on the IMDb has a higher number of people giving it a ten then 7-9 and sometimes any other number, even those with weighted average ratings closer to 3 or 4 and it very sad that people do that. I've noticed that when there is a bad film made by a trendy (and usually much better) director it seems to get a load of 10 ratings before most people would even have had a chance to see it and this is no exception.Anyway I think it needs to be explained to those that praise the film and go on about people not liking it and how they don't understand the morals of the film and that the bisexuality is okay, etc, etc, just why the majority thought this film was rubbish. It's nothing to do with Alexanders orientation or how that was portrayed or the morals of the film.There are only two things you need need to know about the film: 1) The casting was terrible. Some of the minor characters were cast reasonably but the choices for Alexander and his mother was disastrous. Not because of either of those character acting skills but because of the following reasons.1a. Colin Farrell was incapable of dropping his Irish accent or putting on a more sensible accent for his role. As such the supporting Macedonians were all forced to wear Irish accents as well. It's also been noted that he didn't make a very successful blonde. Sure the guy can act, but when casting you have to consider *suitibility*! 1b. On that note, why on earth cast a woman only 2 years older then Farell to play his mother? Totally bizarre. I love Jolie as an actress, and like most men think she is gorgeous, but she was just not suitable for that role. Also because she was one of the few cast members that chose to put on an accent other then Irish she stands out like a sore thumb.1c. The rest of the cast too have been blatantly chosen for their stature as actors rather then their actual suitability or capability to pull of the particular roles they were chosen for. The cast list is impressive, but that seems to be it's entire reason for being. It's almost like Stone is showing off the names he can attract (and the studio can afford) for his film. That is not, in my mind, they way to cast a movie.2) The film has terrible pace and is nightmarishly long.Alexander is someone that has fought more battles then I've had pizza's (and I've had a lot of pizza's). Yet if you were randomly skipping through the movie you'd really struggle to stop it at a point where an actual battle is going on. Visually these rare battles are impressive, but because of the poor build ups and the way the excessive scenes of long theatrical style monologues kill off any excitement you may otherwise be feeling about the battles it is very hard to appreciate these scenes.Of course as I'm sure you've all noticed it's very trendy to overshoot films these days. It seems rare to see a film under 2 hours long and so many directors seem to be making films long apparently just for the sake of it. They want to be as epic as lord of the rings or Gladiator and figure that all it takes is to make the film really really long. Well the first thing you'd noticed about those two films (or 4 films technically) is that they don't seem anywhere near as long as there running time (even the 4 hour special edition of return of the king kept me interested for the duration, and I wouldn't normally compare films to LOTR but with so many people suggesting this is worth a 10 I think it has to be done). This film however seemed about twice as long as it's excessive running time and that is a very bad thing. People gave up and walked out with at least 40 minutes still to go! Now all those monologues may not be intended to come across as such, but all the actors seem to have adopted a theatrical style of reading their long long lines as if they were reciting Shakespeare. If this was a play I could live with that, but this is a film and it needs the right kind of pacing.So in summary - terrible casting, terrible pace, excessively long. Bi-Sexuality and ancient morals are irrelevant in evaluation of this film, terrible casting, terrible pace, excessively long. QED.Oh yeah there are also a good few cheesy clich√©s and terrible lines (like the one about 'of all the Alexander's he is the greatest' what moron wrote that!). But really, overshadowed by the pace/casting.",3,3,6,6 January 2005
Pearl Harbor," War is unpleasant, but this film is worse.
","The historical facts are all wrong, and it ends up as a bad rip off of Titanic, Top gun and Legends of the Fall, and . Tora Tora was by far a better film despite the age.Only 1 American plane took off and only 1 Japanese plan crashed (due to an engine failure) not the seven that got shot down in one of the top gun scenes of the film.The film belittles the true storys which it drops in as more of an after thought (like the cooks story) and trys to re-write a lot of the facts in typical Hollywood style for the sake of American pride. What's worse is the bad romantic story (ripped off Legends of the fall it seems) that makes the film take so long to start. The actual pearl harbour section in minimal and the best bits can be seen in the trailer for the film.It seems they tried to do this Titanic style, only they failed to give most of it any believability. By the time they started dropping the bombs I was hard pushed to feel sympathetic. On top of it all, the changes they made ended up diminishing the impact of the disaster section of the movie.It'd be nice to see a movie start with Pearl Harbour and end with Hiroshima, and not try and make it 'spunky' and cheap. It seems bad war films are popular with hollywood these days for some reason, all changing history and afraid to show the truth. It is rather unfortunate.",4,0,1,11 January 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Pretentious Genius, good and bad in one.
","Okay don't get me wrong I like the Matrix films. But let's get a few things straight. They didn't invent bullet time, trenchcoats, sunglasses or black shiny outfits. Nor is the concept of Robots rebelling against mankind after being mistreated a new one. Infact it's got to be one of the oldest in sci-fi history.Okay, as I said I liked the films and when you look at what they achieved with what is basically a sack full of action/sci-fi cliques it's pretty damn impressive. This is largely down to the directors vision in putting this together. It's the glue that is important not the individual parts. None of this is really new, but it's what is being done with it that is impressive.The problem I have is people seem to be forgetting this already. Not least of which being hollywood that seems determined to put these elements into every action film they make without regard to wether they work or not. The excessive bullet time works in the matrix where as it definetly doesn't in films set outside of a manipulated reality (like when they used it in a certain bond film). While the Matrix made good on old cliques it's created a whole load of new ones that seem set to be even more overused then the old ones ever were. This is something many people seem to celebrate about the Matrix series but I think people that do that have missed the point.All this stuff with the game and the animatrix is just cross marketing. Nothing more, nothing less and damn it I'm fed up with seeing everyone wearing trenchcoats. I've been wearing them for as long as I can remember and they've come in and out of fashion but since these films there are more people then ever wearing them. Apparently you have to christen a new DVD player with a matrix film, it's 'traditional' apparently. This seems a bit of a joke to me. Don't forget even good things can be over-rated (I've said for years that as good as the Beatles were they are still one of the most over-rated bands of all time). It's all getting a bit too prententious for my liking and I think people are letting it cloud their judgement.
This film wasn't as good as the first film. It was somewhat predictable both in style and plot. But as I said it wasn't the most origional of ideas ever stated. The whole plot could have been something off the twilight zone or the outer limits. The imagery is standard cool-gothic and again nothing overly origional. However it is put together tremendously well and there are a few scenes that really impress.It's not the best series of films of all time, and as individual films I doubt this particular one would likely make it into the top 50 (at least not my top 50). Definetly impressive for the special effects, stunts and the way it is all put together. They really do know how to use CGI, many otherwise excellent directors are clueless when it comes to computer animation so they have shown what can be done. I also don't think it's really that ground breaking either when you think about it. Most of the effects used have been around for years, but it shows what can be done with it all. But it's mostly down to focused minds and a lot of hard work rather then doing anything really new. The scripts not the best ever written, the actors are pretty average (especially Keanu Reaves) and the basic plot elements really are not at all origional.But it's all about vision and this film (and the others in the series) have an abundance of it. It is one of the most visually pleasing films to watch and it's important to remember that while the visual elements such as the long coats aren't origional they weren't in high fashion before the first matrix came out and so were picked because they would work in the film and not because they were trendy.It's just sad it has led to hollywood being overun by the idea that having cliques in the films are more important then the suitibility of them being used. Two of the worst films to be victims of that phenomenom I've seen so far have been that last bond film (with the poor madonna soundtrack) and the film of 'House of the Dead'. Do give those a miss.Don't give this film a miss though. It's worth watching the whole trillogy if you can. Although I suspect there aren't many people that haven't.",6,0,0,29 October 2003
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," What could have been a good film ruined by Bay's totally incompetence .
","I was totally addicted to Transformers as a kid and I really wanted to like this, but instead the film just upset me at how wrong so much of it was. If only this was directed by someone with actual talent it could have been the most awesome blockbuster ever. But Michael Bay is frankly an incompetent hack with virtually no respect for his own source material.Of the many things wrong: * The film was still dominated by the human sub-stories and excessive comedy relief moments that mostly fell flat. The one comedy moment that actually made me giggle involved the 'Wheelie' character, which I won't ruin by giving detail on. Almost all of the comedy was juvenile (including the bit I found funny).* Bay constantly spins the camera round and round during 'dramatic' talking scenes. That stuff is what people that don't know how to build tension do to fill in for their lack of actual skill. It just makes me dizzy and want to vomit.* The Power balance seemed all wrong in this movie. The deceptions pretty much seem to be complete pussies and the big scary 'ohhhhhh how can we beat him' Megatron from the previous film has been replaced by a wimpy lackey Megatron that needs help to fight Optimum Prime (who he soundly pummelled in the first film). Even the weaker autobots seemed to be kicking butt while the decepticons seemed to drop like flies.* The focus for both Autobots and Decepticons seemed to be mostly on the comedy relief bots. Megatron and Starscream had some good moments between them and Optimus was cool as always, but it seemed the other decent characters were pushed so far into the background they were just miscellaneous background fodder. I really don't care that much for a non-talking Bumblebee (that's Wreck-Gar's gimmick anyway) and the ghetto twins (who seemed like superimposed cartoons half the time). Plus there just seemed to be way too many of them to really do any justice (especially the decepticons).* I really didn't have a frigging clue what was going on at the end with the action. I'm sure I saw the same deception die about 25 times. Most of them look and sound so similar and the action was so all over the place (and of course not really focused on the robots) that I just found myself baffled as to who was fighting who half the time.* The whole idea of using the Fallen just overshadowed the rest of the decepticons, especially Megatron. I remember in the animated Transformers movie, Megatron/Galvatron always planned to betray Unicron. He answers to no one, at least not willingly. If that version treated the enormous planet eater like that, I find it hard to accept the movie version so willingly serving the Fallen. Not the the Fallen is actually used much as a character, he just seems to be there to make the rest of the deceptions look like Tools.On the positive side I like the use of Soundwave and Starscream in this and the way they worked Jetfire into it. Overall there was a good film in there but there was a couple of really bad ones mixed up with it. A few bits I enjoyed, a few bits puzzled me, a few bits made me want to cry they were so wrong, but most of it I just found boring.",3,1,5,30 June 2009
War of the Worlds," Forget the book, this is a remake of the 50's film, and a bad one!
","Both Cruise and Spielberg are big fans of the old film, and it shows. The only trace of the actual book that has overtaken their determination to tribute it's first movie incarnation is the change of the Martian machines from flying lampshade type things to actual tripods. Other then that the entire film is just an attempt to put a marginally different perspective on the 50's version.To be fair, it does start out well (and there are some good cinematic moments throughout). Some claim it continues well for about 2/3rds of the film, but I think in truth it is only the first 3rd that works at all. It doesn't take long for clich√©s and overly predictable plot elements to creep in and there is nothing daring or risky about anything attempted by Spielberg after about 20 minutes in. It's all very well for people to go on about the focus on the main Character. But I don't think that is particularly groundbreaking. There are a good number of other directors I think can bring off a personal perspective much better so I don't think Spielberg is even playing to his strengths on this one.Plus, when you have an astronomical budget, one major star and material a good 80% of the audience will already know pretty well (anyone not know how it was going to end?), it pretty much goes without saying that people are going to want to see a lot more of the invading martians. It's all very well to point to the rules of good horror and claim not seeing stuff is suspenseful but is it entirely appropriate for this particular film? I would say not. If Spielberg wanted to do a film like that, why not come up with something fresh rather then doing a remake of a well known film based on a well known book. When you already know what is going on, there is nothing gained by not showing it.The film didn't need to worry about action clich√©s as in actual fact this film should never have been an action film. Humanity can't defend against these invaders, so why show anything but futility. Perhaps because that wouldn't be very Hollywood, and for all the good intentions of the film it descended into pretty standard action by the end anyway.What I would have liked to have seen would have been more dramatic spectacles, barren landscapes, shocking scenes of destruction, etc. More of the martians and perhaps show how the governments totally failed to stop them with everything they tried. They actually achieved that in the 40's film, so one of the things Spielberg did leave out was the one aspect that really gave the 'not killed by man' aspect. As a result the very end leaves you cold, and as a big slap in the face to the book they include a voice over copied directly from the 50's film putting everything in a religious point of view (the one thing that really let down the 40's film). The book was to a large extent very anti-religious and there was no need to ignore that very important aspect of the original story. It's not even comfortably put on the end, because with the (totally unnecessary) heroic triumphs achieved by Cruise minutes early it seems like we've suddenly cut to the end of a different film.Perhaps the influence of the 50's film was too much for him. After all, anyone ever notice how similar ET looks to the aliens in the 50's film? If you were to take those aliens and make them cute, you'd end up with ET. Certainly not a co-incidence. This is very much Spielberg remaking what must have been his favourite film.One thing with Spielberg I always found annoying is his obsession with getting certificates that let kids see the film. For a start no other director could release films like this and like Jurassic park (where someones arm is ripped off his body) and get such family orientated ratings. But even with his ability to manipulate censors, he still has to hold back from making what the film should have been just for the sake of letting the kiddies see it. I guess at the end of the day it's all about money and ego and not just about making a really good film.So there you go. I gave this a disappointing 4 out of 10. It had a lot of potential but there are so many flaws and so many mixed up ideas that are never fully realised I just couldn't give it a good score. I couldn't even give it an average score, because with Spielberg, Cruise and the special effects budget I have to compare it to what I think should have been possible with the money spent and talent involved. This film is one of the great underachiever of the modern day. Compare that to the 50's film, which for the time period had stunning effects, a compelling plot and flaws that were all to understandable given the time of filming. It way ahead of it's time and is still a reasonable watch even five decades later. Can anyone honestly say this will last so well?",4,2,3,25 July 2005
Signs," Overated, unorigional and poorly thought out.
","Despite the big names, and big hype, this film was very poor and seems to just be bits and pieces taken from other films and roughly joined together. War of the worlds, Day of the triffids, night of the living dead and the blair witch project all have their little sections of film. It seems to do it's best to be 'trendy' and 'modern' while at the same time totally failing to be anything origional let alone groundbreaking.The one good moment in this film is where you catch first glimpse of one of the aliens walking past an alley. The low points are during the 'blair witch' scene in the basement, and the 'day of the triffids' ending. The aliens themselves are not remotely believable. Not due to special effects, but due to their incredible stupidity and their lack of both judgement and planning. Not even George Bush Junior could mess up that bad, and this is meant to be an advanced race. I could list all the floors, but I'm sure others have done that already. Suffice to say this film is very bad and very over rated.",3,1,2,27 April 2003
