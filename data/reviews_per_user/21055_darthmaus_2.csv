Minority Report," Great fun, nice effects -- but don't expect the Dick story
","Probably the best role that the frequently miscast Tom Cruise has ever done. The writing, dialogue, and acting are all very good for a blockbuster science fiction movie.  The effects are great, the action is exciting.  The design of the world and the technology within it is believable and fascinating.  All in all, an extremely entertaining science fiction movie.However, do not go into this one expecting the Philip K. Dick story of the same name, or you will be sorely disappointed!  While the movie certainly takes many of the plot devices of the story, it makes huge changes - especially in the ending - and is even fundamentally different in theme.",7,0,0,4 January 2003
The Red Violin," Sexy, sensual, stunning, exciting
","Rich colour and camera work complement the stunningly gorgeous soundtrack of this incredibly sensuous film.  Most of the acting is top-notch.  This is not a staid, reserved period piece:  spanning centuries, the slightly disturbing plot moves ahead relentlessly without being disorienting or confusing.A beautifully constructed work of art with all the action and romance (and sex and violence!) of a popular cineplex movie, this should appeal to any adult audience.",9,0,0,15 December 2002
