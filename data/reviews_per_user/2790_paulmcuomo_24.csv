Child 44," The two stars is for the only two performances in this thing.
","OK. As someone who'd known about this movie for a solid 9 months before its release - namely due to the powerhouse of acting talent involved - I saw despite the somewhat mixed reviews on it. Rotten Tomatoes didn't look great BUT critics gave good reviews. Those critics smegging lied to my face! The only two people who come out of this thing without a blemish on them are Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace; not only is the relationship between Leo and Raisia an ever-evolving, three-dimension thing and literally the only good characterisation to movie offers, but on their own they give performances that give depth and nuance beyond the surface. But I'm going to target the three things in this movie that are god awful.DIRECTING: The action scenes in this movie combine many things that action-movies do too much of: shoot too close to the action, cut away at moments that should be held, shaky cam for days AND a hero who gets a beaten silly and shrugs it off like it was nothing. This makes the film completely fail as an action movie, especially when some of the stuntwork is laughable. There's a scene where a guy of average build and fairly short sature throws Tom Hardy over his head like he was throwing a sleeping bag; you can just imagine the audience reaction. The final fight scene is Leo, his arch-nemesis Vasili and Raisia fighting in a mud-pit, with shaky-cam, too many cuts and shooting too close...who hired this guy? VILLAIN: I have to talk about this because this movie does something unbelievable. The titular murder of 44 children makes up the B-plot of the movie, and the actual child-murderer is the secondary villain. I'm not joking; the child murderer played by Paddy Considine is not well developed, characterised or shot and once he actually comes face-to-face with Leo, the film drops him like a bag of s**t and instead replaces him with Joel Kinnaman's Vasili, who is by far the most stupid, predictable, unlikeable, 1D villain I've seen in a while. This guy does stuff for literally no reason other than to be a villain. His only reason to be nasty to Leo is at the beginning of the film, Leo and his gang (which Vasili's) part of, try and find a fugitive, and after the aforementioned fight scene where Leo is chucked around, Vasili shoots the owners of the farm WHO WEREN'T EVEN HIDING HIM in front of their children, so Leo punches him and calls him a prick. Following this, he goes to insane levels to get back at him, including having him shamed and expelled from the secret police, trying to force his wife to sleep with him, killing and terrorising his friends FOR NO REASON. This is not a good villain in anyway; the only thing he could be is threatening, but he's too stupid to outsmart the heroes and not strong enough in combat to match Leo physically.WRITING: The complete failure of this film is the script. Even at 2 hours 17 minutes, it does not come close to fitting anything in well, with the poorly characterised characters other than Leo and Raisia, the insulting motives of the child murderer, the bad pacing. Basically it all sucks.Part of my anger is the fact I wasted a lot of time watching this AND I paid to see it - yes, out of the 3.3 million it grossed, some of that was me. I wish I got a refund. If you do still want to see this, see it if its on TV.",2,55,99,17 May 2015
Hereditary," A potential horror classic, spoilt by a silly, cliche ending
","From what I understand, this is one of those movies that critics love and audiences at the minute seem to hate. It's kind of like The Witch, which I really liked and was a really great example of slow burning, intense, isolated horror within a family setting. It's no surprise that this movie is also from the producers of this movie.Personally, I think this movie is a little bit the victim of hype on behalf of the trailers that call this 'The Exorcist for this generation' and comments of a similar ilk. Sadly, the film is a little too slow burn for that.Generally, I would say by far the strongest element of the movie is the cast that is all very worthy of awards for their acting - in particular the standout Toni Collette as Annie, who has to give a vastly layered performance of grief without ever becoming monotonous, which she does do in spades and is impressive in both her power and her brokenness. Also great is Gabriel Byrne as the cynical and realist Steve, who loves his family and his wife especially, but is also in a position where he's not able to give Annie what she wants, and this ultimately costs him. Alex Wolff does give a very solid performance in a character role that we've never seen from him before, but I do think that whilst he is exceptionally good in this film as Peter grieving over his sisters' death, I think he gave a better performance in My Friend Dahmer, but that could do with the fact that character was a bit more intelligent than here, where he is, to be honest, an imbecile in places. Most exceptional is young MIlly Shaprio as Charlie, who's not in the film long before her death that's the catalyst for the action, but really gives her some recognisable tics and mannerisms that stick with you after she leaves, and that when they return do give the horror some grounding. And then there's Ann Dowd as the film's overarching antagonist Joan, politely and sweetly being a friend to Annie in her suffering, but really planning the whole thing. In anything is certain, this is an Oscar worthy cast.Feature debut director Ari Asher does break horror clichés for the most part, avoiding jump scares in favour of slow-burn, emotionally brutal horror, very well lit and very well written. It makes use of mental manifestations, processions and more, to make us frightened on a deeper level.However, this is where my issues with the film come to light.
Now, it's nothing new for me to have my opinion adjusted of a movie by it's ending - it's what took me from being apathetic about Me Before You to absolutely hating it, and what took me from being mad at Memento to loving it. Endings can make or break a film. This one breaks it.Don't get me wrong, it doesn't ruin the movie, but it does become the point that Asher ends up falling INTO the cliches' rather than cleverly avoiding them. It all starts to go downhill when Steve dies and Annie becomes possessed. Having already been explained that a male host is needed for the villain to succeed, and being left with a moronic 17 year old who just does dumb things pretty much always, all tension is lost because we know he's screwed. Surely enough, instead of running out his front door, he goes to the attic, and jumps out of the top window. He then becomes possessed by the demon and all is lost.There's also significant decisions made that really cost the film tonally here - first is the decision to have a headless corpse levitate up a ladder instead of moving on its own which would've bee far more effective, there's the musical score that went from being dark and sinister to being overly upbeat, there's the clichéd death-of-family-pet which, as a pet owner, I hate, see no point in, and does NOTHING TO FURTHER ANYTHING, also an over abudance of older naked people that do nothing to add to the mood but detract from it, and then finally some confusing speech at the end. Roll credits.Here's the thing - I do still really rate this movie. There's a lot in it to defend, but there's also things you can't defend, which is a shame. Certainly, with a film like this, you need to see it and form your own opinion. So please, go do so.",8,0,2,25 June 2018
Detroit," A lot of positives from one of the best films of the year (so far)
","Detroit is the latest in Kathryn Bigelow's unofficial 'trilogy' into real world crime/war stories, that she has produced alongside screenwriter Mark Boal, alongside The Hurt Locker, which I didn't see but hear amazing things about, and Zero Dark Thirty, which I really enjoyed for its scope, intensity and bittersweet conclusion.Detroit, unlike those films, is very much shot in a documentary format and look i.e. with the way the frames come up with the filters, the shaky cam kind of style, and the very continuing shots that obviously go on for a long time without stopping. I've always loved this about Bigelow - she's very much the American, female Paul Greengrass when it comes to this.In terms of the cast, the film has very much an ensemble feel, with not really one central character; we follow the actions on the night by Desmukes, a security guard played by John Boyega, a soul and R&B singer Larry Reed played by Algee Smith about how him and a friend took refuge at the Algiers Hotel on that night, and the actions of the Police Officers led by the brutal Phillip Klauss played by Will Poulter before, during and after the night. There are also really great and brilliant supporting bit roles by Anthony Mackie and Jason Mitchell, also with Hannah Murray among others.This film, much like Nolan's Dunkirk, wastes no time in throwing you right into the havoc - in many ways you can say that this film is very structurally similar - just before the credits roll, you see a news scroll of all the events that happen over song, before a lingering close-up of one of the main character's faces, or as close to with an ensemble film. Also, like Dunkirk, the film is incredibly tense with its action and focus, and the way in which it very comfortably covers the whole battle/riot very continuously. The character's are a bit more spread thin than in Dunkirk, with the notable exceptions of Klauss and Reed, both of which I will talk about in a moment, but ultimately works in its favour. Where the film differs from Dunkirk, and by extension Zero Dark Thirty, is the unrelenting bleakness of the whole film; it's no secret that whilst no-one knows for sure the events that took place that night, it's well acknowledged that Police get away with the brutality that took place that night, and that those practices, whilst immoral and disencouraged, still do happen.The cast is probably the films most obvious strength - no-one feels like a actor, even though they've been in Game of Thrones, The Avengers and Star Wars among others - and the continuousness of takes, really ramp up the threat level. My only complaint with the film in general, aside from an occasional lack of music, is that the lack of a properly POV character does make the film a bit too hard to invest in; it does have a villain, but not really a hero, although that may be symbolic of the fact that there isn't really a hero.In terms of the characters, they are quite uniformly appealing, with the main two standouts being Algee Smith's portrayal of the R&B singer who loses his best friend on the same night that he witnesses some truly ugly stuff, and comes out of the event with his perception and personality altered, with a really great emotional through line of optimistic about his music career, to scared for his life, to anger over his friend's death and the subsequent lack of justice, to new found contentment in leading a church gospel band. It's a great performance, especially from an actor as new as him. And then there's Phillip Klauss, played by Will Poulter, who really is amazing in his. Klauss is such an interesting villain, in that overall, he is just a cop; a very violent, means-justifies-the-end type of cop, but he's still a very low rung officer. Poulter has kind of got a reputation for playing soft characters, such as his role in We're The Millers and The Revenant, but in this is great as his menace maintains, to the point you're gutted with his lack of comeuppance. Him and Smith are very much Best Supporting Actor contenders in my books. John Boyega is good, but to be honest he's not in enough of the film to really talk about.This is an important movie, that talks of a contemporary topic, and remembers to be good. I really enjoyed this movie, so go and check it out.",8,4,12,30 August 2017
Wind River," A hatrick for Taylor Sheridan's official trilogy
","Whilst it's not exact to refer to this, Sicario and Hell or High Water as a trilogy in setting or character, it certainly is through themes as said by Sheridan himself. In all of his films so far, there is a principle character who is a father who is trying to make amends for previous shortcomings as a parent. In Sicario, that was Benicio Del Toro's Alejandro, in Hell or High Water it was Chris Pine's Toby, and in this we have Jeremy Renner's Cory Lambert, a wildlife reserve hunter who despite his profession as a protector and hunter is haunted by the murder of his daughter Emily three years prior to the events of this movie.Sheridan, as an actor, is expert with giving his actors, even the minor players, a lot to play with. Now, with him moving behind the lense with this film, he shows that he can also give his actors excellent direction to go with this. In particular, the standout of this movie is Jeremy Renner in his role as Cory. Cory is noteworthy in this film, since he lives and works in the Wyoming Wind River Native American reverse, of being one of the few white American men who work on the land, and is ironically the outsider here. Renner plays the character with a steel similar to Del Toro's portrayal of Alejandro, but is far more empathetic, and is certainly the standout of the film's amazing cast.Elsewhere, Elizabeth Olsen is in the film playing FBI Agent Jane Banner. She's newly qualified, completely unprepared for the conditions, and completely under resourced. This character could've easily been a useless bimbo type of girl, but fortunately in the hands of Olsen, this part gifted by one of the most exciting new writers of our time is given something new: Jane is smart enough to recognise that she's out of her depth and needs help, is humble enough to empathise with Ben, the police chief, and is realistically capable in gunfight situations.The film's plot is simple, but intriguing: the body of a Native American woman, Natalie, is found raped, barefoot, 6 miles from the nearest civilisation in extreme snow. Jane arrives, and teams up with the Police and Cory to find the truth. The simplicity of the plot doesn't affect the pacing, which is certainly contemplative for the first 20 minutes, but then the rest of the film grows in action and interest - should be noted that this film is very short by modern film standards, at 110 minutes. It certainly is visually interesting, with lots of fantastic poetic imagery with Cory hunting the wolves to protect the Native's flock, the snowstorm setting looking great on screen, and strong correlation of soundtrack and imagery and the way the two don't trample on the other.The supporting cast is amazing, with actors such as Graham Greene, James Jordan, Julia Jones and Eric Lange providing memorable roles.But the true standouts among the supporting cast are Gil Birmingham, who plays Natalie's father, a big, warm presence in the film consisting of the cold, Kelsey Chow playing Natalie herself, and Jon Bernthal playing Natalie's similarly ill-fated boyfriend Matt. Bernthal and Chow only have one scene in the movie, and it's a scene that needs to work otherwise both the investment of the audience and the realism of the situation would fail, and the vibe they give off - that of a relationship that is genuine, affectionate, funny and caring - is one that makes the events of that scene so much more tragic.This movie is brilliant. Admittedly, I've only watched it the once, but it's certainly got the feeling of rewatchability like Hell or High Water especially has. If you haven't seen it yet, buy the DVD and support it.",10,0,1,1 February 2018
The Danish Girl," I honestly was hoping for more pretentiousness
","I wanted to write a review of this movie, slamming its pretentiousness and hurling tons of allegory onto its maximum levels of Oscar-Bait that the trailer for this movie strained really hard to get across with all of its criteria: the contemporary message of love for the trans community, the good actors, the period-drama setting, the operatic score. Instead, however, I come to tell of a movie that is so emotionally lacking, so frustratingly distant, and so boring, which is in a way the biggest disappointment for me.To start off, the film's production design is strong. There was some over-saturation of the colours they use to show this unrealistically colourful world the character's live in, but the costumes are all interesting and engaging. The mis-en-scene and the editing, however, are a mess; Tom Hooper definitely shoots the environment better than his actors, as whenever a conversation is going on, he continually isolates each character to their own separate take and a camera that focuses in on actors with nothing to react to. This, combined with a continual lack of proper establishing shot, is a terrible choice of how to do the movie; I know he's trying to make them intimate to us, but he fails at making them intimate to each other and, as a result, the audience doesn't care. The editing's a confusing and weird one; there are a much of moments that make no sense. Firstly is a scene where Einar delivers laundry to a woman collecting it, but he does it with such insane speed it makes Usian Bolt look fat and slow (he has to run from one end of their big house to another, after having to tie the bag up tight) and it was so weird you wonder why they included it. Same with the scene where Gerda gets out of a full period costume, including big knee high leather boots, and into another one in the time it takes her husband to paint a smudge on his canvas. But by far the biggest 'why the hell' with the editing is a shot when he's first becoming Lili, and it cuts to some water on the floor. There was literally no point except to confuse the audience.Now onto the biggest issues with this movie - Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander and the script. To start with Alicia, she's great. She honestly is, with both her body of work and her performance in this film as she tries to bring a complete range of colours and shades to this performance as she laughs, smiles, cries, and dances around. The problem is she's trying her damned hardest to add something to nothing. And let's get one thing straight here, this movie treats Gerda Wegener like dirt. She's not a successful artist, she only has a career/notice because of Einar before and after the creation of Lili, and she never, NEVER gets angry, to the point where its insulting as he selfishly pulls himself away from her and into Lili, leaving her absolutely alone. Except for one scene where she pleads with him - 'I need my husband. I want to hold my husband', which is said out of frustration than anything else - she never speaks out on any of it, and when she does, he says one sentence then immediately shuts up. It's like the fantasy of what people hope for other people to be, rather than them actually being it - that scene where she first finds him wearing her nightgown and then immediately starts banging him is so insultingly, unrealistically forgiving that it hurt me. Mr Redmayne now. First of all, whilst I thought that he did do a good job in The Theory of Everything, I did think the Oscar was more appropriate in the hands of Michael Keaton or Jake Gyllenhaal. In this movie, I have the exact same issue as I did with that movie; he only tries with the difficult stuff i.e. the actually being a woman, or actually having Motor Neurone Disease, but the other times he is just a flat page delivering things awkwardly and not really acting. The problem with this is that his Stephen Hawking got ALS in the first 20 minutes of that film and he could really do his thing, but in this, he becomes a woman in the last 10 minutes. Those 10 minutes are wonderful, but it doesn't warrant an Oscar - or any award to be honest. He's a coy, fluttering, meek person who doesn't really change personally throughout the film beyond the physical nature of it. The script is full of lines that are over-shadowing the theme of the story, but not in a good way; lines like 'It was like I was kissing myself' or 'I'm worried you'll look at that picture so long you'll disappear into it' are cringy and not clever.Apart from one scene in a Prostitute peep show, where Einar ends up mimicking the woman's movements as she observes and goes from weirded out to curious to understanding to sorry, the whole film grated for me badly. It's boring, distant and while it was just under 2 hours, I thought I'd been there longerYou want to go see it, be my guest. But if this wins an Oscar - especially for Best Actor, which something of this calibre doesn't warrant - then I hit the floor.",3,42,73,2 January 2016
Knives Out," Easy one of the best films of the year, with plenty of rewatch value
","I saw this film today, and left wishing to see it again in the cinema - a thoroughly enjoyable affair, with a whodunnit with more twists and turns than the Nürburgring.Rian Johnson, who's a filmmaker I've always enjoyed - especially when he can operate without the handcuffs of a franchise such as Star Wars, which is easily the most stifled film to date - and has a habit of writing and directing films that don't quite fit a mold. Brick is a Neo-Noir in theory, but is also not, and Looper is a Sci-Fi that often isn't. Knives Out is a Mystery, but it's predominantly a character study and comedy, particularly with Harlem (Christopher Plummer) and Marta (Ana De Armas).Easily the two best aspects to this story are the contempory nature setting of modern day to contrast with the old school mystery elements similar to Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle stories to help make the story funny, and also the acting.
Quickly on the film's structure and editing, Johnson does manage to do several moments of misdirection; we are shown the truth vey early in the film, as with several people's recounting stories to the police, but the way that the story twists this is something that I think can be taught in Film School as setting precedents and placing details that people might not notice like a phrase, or a question that gets answered later in an organic way. It probably won't get acknowledged by the Oscars in either the screenwriting or editing departments, but it should be.Acting wise, this film is loaded, but the four main standouts are Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana De Armas, and Christopher Plummer.Daniel Craig, who in the vain of Logan Lucky, gets to do something a bit more funny and different than the James Bond films, and it's clear he really enjoys playing this Kentucky version of Sherlock Holmes, who is simultaneously believable as a sleuth - for he does uncover the whole truth - but is also able to make it not seem like a revelation.Chris Evans, similarly, gets to play a character who is the exact opposite of what he does as Captain America, where plays, essentially, a total tool. However, he's a total tool who still carries himself with a degree of charisma and who is watchable and identifiable - even if its the worst parts of him we're identifying with.Ana De Armas and Christopher Plummer respectively play Marta Cabrera and Harlan Thrombley, and are both the heart of the film. Marta is exceptionally likable, and clearly is representative of similar traits of Harlan - both are people who built their success from the ground up, with Harlan being a self-made millionaire crime writer, and Marta being a daughter of immigrants who works as a nurse. Marta is essentially the main character, and also the only one played by someone unfamiliar to Western audiences, as this enhances her appeal as a hard working person, and likewise Plummer plays Harlan like a man who cares for everybody around him and goes out of his way to help them, but is also firm when he needs. Both Plummer and De Armas could've played these roles as 'throwaways', but both of them ensure that we're rooting for both of them until the end. Fantastic work by them both.I loved every part of this film, and I may even see it a few more times in theatres - I recommend you do too.",10,4,21,27 November 2019
The Hateful Eight," Not the best Tarantino, but certainly good Tarantino
","Having literally seen this movie today, and to come out only an hour ago, I have the great chance to write a review with fresh thoughts on the movie. Given all the background info on this movie regarding the leaked script, QT's reluctance to actually make the movie after said leak, the format on which the movie would be shown - 70mm - I do have a lot of things to talk about a film by a filmmaker as individual and unique as Mr Tarantino himself.When you talk about ANY Tarantino movie, there are always three things to discuss; the script, the music and the actors. The script in this film features all the Tarantino hallmarks, namely his ability to give all of the characters cool lines and individual traits to make them easily identifiable, and that's no difference here. There's a non-linear narrative that was cool, and got to use Channing Tatum's short but important role in the film as the leader of Daisy's gang, and in which his performance is strong. There's also a lot of violence that does serve a purpose but does feel slightly unsatisfactory due to the fact that all of the characters are hateful people, and there isn't a Django shooting Billy Crash in the nuts type set-up - there is a nut shooting scene, but its played out more for laughs than actually something more important. One thing that does hold the movie back, however, is that the story doesn't have the dynamic range that Django Unchained, Pulp Fiction or the Tarantino penned True Romance; in a way, he was ambitious to attempt a film as limited in scope and location and make it work like a play, but it doesn't work quite as well as he thought it would - just my opinion there, but it is still as good as anything he's previously written.The actors are standout, and given the lack of overly big names outside of Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell and Channing Tatum, it is very good to say that this movie works amazingly well as an ensemble. Main standouts of the film are Jackson, Tatum, Russell, Damien Bichir as Bob the Mexican who was unexpectedly funny and a nice bit of casting, Walton Goggins who is - really - the only character with a story arc revolving his racist views completely by the end. Jennifer Jason Leigh, as the only woman on the main bill, is astonishingly good. Daisy Domergue is a feral, vicious, violent woman who despite going through injury after injury keeps on that path in a way that is spine-chillingly scary, but Leigh gives her moments of pity (not sympathy - NEVER sympathy) and humour, as well as cunning. Sadly though, due to the reasons regarding violence I previously discussed, her death felt very empty, kind of like Hans Landa's punishment, which was a disappointing way to end the movie.Additionally, I need to close off by praising the soundtrack and the cinematography in buckets of it; the score of the movie is hauntingly good and perfectly captures the Western influences of the movie, as well as the claustrophobic sense of paranoia and distrust going on in the subtext of the story. The 70mm thing is wonderful too - how the camera just disappears into right into the thing in the foreground and perfectly captures the scope of the environment; this gives it not just a sense of epic design to it, but also makes it feel like a movie from the Ben-Hur period.A couple of criticisms; the violence (which is to be expected) just felt hollow, but NOT unnecessary - one instance is particularly important - the story doesn't feel dynamic enough to make it truly great, but the big one is how dated this feels. And I know it's the intention ala Death Proof, where a movie is made in a certain fashion as homage to another tradition, but it was obscenely overdone. It just kept holding the movie back for me, but it didn't make me regret seeing it, as there were so many good points that it really made me glad I saw it.",7,1,11,8 January 2016
Black Mass," Black Mass has a great cast, but only two get used well
","Scott Cooper is a guy who directed Crazy Heart which I've heard is good but haven't seen, and Out of the Furnace which I was unimpressed by for its tone. Regardless, his film have a solid feel to them - they feel robust, and he is great for getting great people in-front of the camera.In this film, the two featured leads, Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, deliver the best work they could possibly do; Depp's performance as James Bulger is malevolent, terrifying, and in many scenes totally believable. He isn't a light, jolly, seductive figure that Depp's reputation lends itself naturally towards, and I think is totally worthy of an Oscar. Joel Edgerton as John Connolly, Bulger's FBI handler who is manipulated is fantastic as the man whose awe of Bulger drags him in deeper and deeper to the point where he can't separate personal and professional boundaries.The biggest problem with the film is that the emotional fulcrum point is around the two most emotionally compromising people. The other cast are fairly wasted; the most notable example is Benedict Cumberbatch, who does great as Senator Billy Bulger, who creates a honorable, no bs man who loses his position because of his brother is pushed to the side despite a great performance with a believable Boston accent.Overall the film is a strong one, but it keeps itself from being perfect. Depp's performance however IS perfect, and is solely worth seeing for that.",6,3,3,8 December 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A film that may not have all the answers, but doesn't claim to. Oh, and top notch acting and writing of course!
","I saw this film yesterday, and I do not regret it - 100% will watch it again.The movie is very much unlike many other movies out at the minute, or in really recent history. Even by Martin McDonaugh's standard's, this is a movie that doesn't fit into the same Black Comedy box as his previous two movies 'In Bruges' or 'Seven Psychopaths'. In fact, this movie is far more up on tragedy than those two, which even in their sad moments have some humour. Don't get me wrong; this is not a film that's lacking in colour or dynamics, but it's certainly bleaker than those others by McDonaugh.At the head of this movie is a phenomenal cast. The most notable of these are the recent Oscar nominated Frances McDormand as Mildred Hayes, Woody Harrelson as Sheriff Bill Willoughby and Sam Rockwell as Officer Jason Dixon.Frances McDormand is a force of nature in this role, and is certainly her best film work since/included Fargo, depending on your opinion. Her character of Mildred is one that could very easily be portrayed as a flawless martyr, striving for justice for her daughter at the behest of everyone else but whom will convince the audience to see her as a perfect person and nothing more. But she doesn't, as whilst you will laugh and cheer when she confronts Dixon in the station with her now famous 'Hey f***head!', you have issues when she tells Willoughby she doesn't care of his cancer, but is later sympathetic when she starts to wain. It's a character that could easily have been boring, but isn't in her hands. The best example of this is when they show a flashback to her final chat with her daughter, and her daughter yells 'I hope I get raped on the way', she responds 'I hope you get raped too!', and that's what happened. It's a great moment, played as intensely as needed for it to work.Woody Harrelson plays a side of him people rarely see. He's not in the film for very long, as he kills himself fairly early in, but he certainly stays in the mind despite this. Willoughby is a man trying to do the right thing, but is going against an unbeatable obstacle, and who we, as an audience, do get a sense of despite his short screen time: a funny, compassionate, well respected leader of the police, and a great father and husband at the same time. When he went, I legit teared up.Sam Rockwell, in his best work ever, plays the character who goes through the biggest arc in the movie. At the start, Dixon is very much a bitter, violent cop with a fragile ego, who when it breaks becomes scary. His endpoint however, whilst not a complete 180, is still big; he learns to take his time, think things through, and be more willing to do a policeman's work for the good of the community than himself.Martin McDonaugh's screenplay is top tier brilliance, as humour and horror do exist in the same plain, and his direction is just as sterily clean, so when the violence does hit, it really does. The two biggest examples are when the fight between Mildred, her ex-husband Charlie played by John Hawkes, and her son Robbie played by Lucas Hedges, and when Dixon attacks the billboard owner in a rage at his office.The ending, whilst not what I was expecting, was welcome. To me, it signals that whilst the resolve isn't there, the character's of Mildred and Jason have found a purpose beyond and this helps them to cope. As they head off to places unknown to do a thing they're not sure of, we know that their moral compasses are still guiding them, in this very adult, very great film, that is totally worth a rewatch.One last thing: the race issue in this movie, is something that, if it hadn't been brought up, you wouldn't notice. It's ironic that in a movie that is based around growing in compassion and empathy, that this strange label of racism has been put on a movie that neither promotes these viewpoints, but the character's that do exhibit these points of view see the error of them.Whatever; I enjoyed this film regardless, and that won't change. If you think it looks like a good viewing, give it a go.",10,4,8,23 January 2018
Nightcrawler," The lights are all in Jake Gyllenhaal's (very scary) eyes in Nightcrawler
","Screenwriter Dan Gilroy was clearly influenced by the Protagonists Travis Bickle, Rupert Pimpkin, the Bad Lieutenant and real-life entrepreneurs in the making of this film. Lou Bloom's psychotic, wide-eyed, single tracked ambition for success is materialised by Jake Gyllenhaal's visceral, cunning performance. Most of this review is going to be praising the performance of Jake, because he's an actor I do really love. He's a character actor ultimately, who still does have lead actor charisma and sex appeal, and his Lou is as natural as he is constructed. The weight loss is an obvious construct (an idea that supposedly was all Gyllenhaal's), as it makes him look like a ghoulish, haunting figure of the night that's looking for the next kill or something along those lines, but his charm (albeit superficial) grows across the film. His emotional journey is one where he implements himself into the business and establishes himself as a leader, doing something few others can and become his own boss, as well as portray a brutal rise that few films portray as well as this. I'd go as far as to say this is his greatest performance to date, and the fact he went without being nominated at the Oscars is an insult.Other things to say about the film is how much like LA it feels; its very flashy, very location heavy, very media-centric. Because Lou is written to have grown-up in LA, it makes sense that the film plays these themes out with Lou, and also his Protégé Rick, competition Joe Loder and 'love interest' Nina. The films themes come through because of the soundtrack which is very high-octane and based in the electrical sphere.Other positives to give this movie that I feel a great amount for is that this film, being a family affair, plays greatly to the strengths of Tony Gilroy as producer, John Gilroy as editor, and Nina Russo (Dan's wife) as actress; production and editing make this movie shine in the night, and the chase scene between the films 'bad guys', the police and Video Production News is so tightly shot and edited, its almost amazing the movie cost the amount it did - you'd think it be at least twice as much as that. And Nina, played by Russo, grounds the film in a place where she is both authoritative but vulnerable to Lou as he forces himself on her - both in business and in sex - and how she makes decisions based on Lou's articulate, rapid analyses.Nightcrawler is a great independent film that shows off the city in ways that movies like Collateral, Midnight Cowboy, Training Day did, but this does whilst adding a commercialised, business-like message that sets it apart. Give it a watch, it's really worth it.",9,2,3,8 December 2015
Baby Driver," Confident, swaggering heist jukebox comedy thriller that will blow you away
","Title not enough to go on for my thoughts on this movie? That's OK; I'm cool to go deeper.This movie is the latest film to be directed by Edgar Wright, the same hyperactive auteur behind the Cornetto trilogy - Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End - and also Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. All of these films are fantastic and very much some of the best movies of the modern century, let alone some of the best comedies. His films do feature very whip sharp dialogue and editing, along with very faithful homages to the genre he's satirising/straight up directing for. This film is no different.Principally, this movie is in a genre that's hard to pin down: it could very much fit into any one of those that I listed in the title of this review, because it inhabits each of them equally. The way it utilises the comedy and thriller elements are typically brilliant of an Edgar Wright project, but even still, the editing is on top form here. This is really apparent during the action scenes, where the action is cut to the music i.e. gunshots that play to drum beats, or the actual timing of the beginning and ends of the action scenes being on point. It extends beyond into how Baby interacts with Debora at the launderette, and builds a really, REALLY infectious kineticism with the movie that its exceptional.The filmmaking is solid, but also the writing is great as well. Everything that is set up within the film comes into play at some point, and in very unexpected ways that are genius - even the spelling of Debora's name comes into play, or a particular song being used in a way that you wouldn't expect it to be. There's also the inclusion of a kind-of Antagonist switch at the final act of the movie; I haven't seen that in a long time. This originality, and not patronising the audience with stuff they've seen before is totally refreshing.And then we have the acting. Ansel Elgort, who's best known for The Fault in our Stars, is really giving a new start to his career as this charming, cool, but also quietly powerful performance as Baby, who is aware that he's playing alongside dangerous criminals but also has standards that come into play throughout the film. Additionally, his chemistry with Lily James is quite endearing and sweet, and realistic for a pair of 17 year olds. Kevin Spacey is in this film, giving his best film performance in a long time, as the mob boss Doc who is both a parental figure to Baby but also is very demanding of him in a deep kind of way. His presence in the film is a welcome one to keep the thriller and comedic elements afloat. However, the two best performances in the film - and I WILL state that they are Oscar worthy here - are by Jamie Foxx as 'Bats' and Jon Hamm as 'Buddy'. Both are the subject of that Antagonist switch I mentioned earlier, and the way they are utilised as direct threats to Baby and everything he has are genius. These characters are both individually fantastic: they are in equal measures terrifying and hilarious at the same time, and get some great lines. There's also supporting performances by Jon Bernthal at the beginning very briefly as a gangster, Eiza Gonzalez as Buddy's wife Darling who is equally awesome, and a heart warming performance by deaf actor CJ Jones as Baby's foster father.In short, see this movie. I predict it'll get no awards attention even though it sorely deserves it, and I would love it if it did. Just make sure you see it in a cinema and get the best experience you can with it.",10,11,19,12 July 2017
The Revenant," A beautiful, brutal, violent, intense Western that I just love!
","Following Birdman, although Alejandro G. Inarritu had been developing this project long before that film, this film is a step back in joking and light-heartedness and a step up in white-knuckle fury.I do love this movie, but given the movie does have some very minor problems, I'll just quickly cover them all.1. The script, whilst it isn't god-awful and the crew do amazing things with the film despite it, it is easily the weakest part of the film. Unlike Birdman, where whatever got shot got ended up in the movie, this movie is shot a bit more conventionally with edits and the like, so the script just isn't as tight. 2. Tom Hardy's accent, even by his standards, takes a lot of effort to understand. He's got the diction and the enunciation of a heavy Texan down to a tee but he rushes it sometimes and it is a little distracting. 3. Hugh Glass's dreams can get very weird and often pretentious. Personally, I like a little bit of pretentiousness, but you possibly won't. Just a friendly warning than an outright flaw.Alright, now I've done this, time to gush about the film: The direction is amazing - the angles we see are insane, and when the movie does eventually mix with CGI for the animals, notably the bear attack, I'm amazed with how real it actually looks. The Cinematography is f---ing AMAZING! I remember making a film in Abbey Wood, and struggling to get a good shot in decent weather, and so how they got a lot of these beautifully framed shots I'll never know. Every new shot of the film, I just kept asking 'how did they do that?', and even the scenes of unbelievable violence like the bear attack or the fights with the Indians look so gorgeous. The acting of the four main players is great - the four main players are Will Mellor playing the young Jim Bridger, Domhall Gleeson as Captain Andrew Henry, Tom Hardy playing the antagonistic John Fitzgerald and obviously Leonardo DiCaprio playing the fiercely resistant and resourceful Hugh Glass. Will Mellor and Domhall Gleeson, in spite of being more supporting players, do get affective moments when they are operating in moments of emotional and physical discomfort and totally selling it. And whilst I criticised his voice, Tom Hardy's first Oscar-nomination for his acting is well deserved - his body language and intent with the eyes is totally spot-on. Fitzgerald is a character who has to be sold as real because moments of deeper reason and nuance are sold off over the course of the movie, but Hardy creates those moments of flipping it around - we see him, after the initial attack by the Indians berating Glass and his half-Indian son and saying incredibly vicious things and you begin to hate him, then he pulls back his cap and reveals a big bald patch, from where Indians had scalped him and pulls a look of total anger. Immediately perception is flipped.In fact, Hardy and DiCaprio are playing really different to the kind of characters they usually do; DiCaprio tends to fly best when he's playing very dialogue heavy parts like Jordan Belfort, and Hardy is very, VERY much a physical, body language type of performance. Here's it's flipped, and Tom Hardy is given a majority of the dialogue and Leo gets to work with very little and give a performance that is so visceral and tortured that it's something almost beautiful; you are totally behind him as he makes his long as hell journey back home. This will be his Oscar winning performance, I'm sure of it: a performance that is genuinely brilliant and not at all bait to boot.This movie is brilliant, but it is brutal, especially with that bear attack scene: it's a continuous 5 minute shot of a man getting the hell beaten out of him, and this bear is not holding back. This bear does pretty much everything conceivable to him, and it's a groundbreaking piece of Acting, Animation, Direction, Cinematography and Sound Design that needs to be seen in Theatres. Right now; go see it!",10,0,5,19 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Standing Man is the subtle bad ass in this great Spielberg movie
","Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have worked together on previous occasion - the most successful collaboration being 1999's Saving Private Ryan. Whilst that was an all-out, realistic, intense war film, this is a quiet, contemplative war film.The film hangs its chances of success on the performances of Hanks and experienced Shakespearian actor Mark Rylance; both of them are great in different ways. Hanks is an everyman character, which he's become accustomed to, but allows for moments of humour present in many of his quips, and in a scene where he slowly deconstructs a CIA agent for prying into his relationship with Abel (the spy). He doesn't give as emotional or urgent a performance as he did in Captain Phillips, Cast Away, Forrest Gump or Philadelphia, but this certainly is a great standalone piece of work. As Rudolph Abel, Mark Rylance is so subdued that it's understandable why the real life Abel was so successful a spy; the way he quietly goes about his duties, commands the people holding him captive, and how he stays unbelievably calm in spite of the seriousness of the situation is almost boss like. At times his understating was slightly awkward, but the overall effect was very effective.The production values are really high in this movie, and each place feels different; America is warm and bright in colour, East Germany is colder - and has a cooler palate. The distinction emphasises the Everyman being a hero and strengthens the film. Some might say it could be conceived as pro-American, I view it as good directing and strengthening the story.The script is great, overall. It has a lot of information to unload about all the main players in the story - James Donovan, Abel, and also Gary Powers and Frederick Prior - and it does handle it effectively. It does play a little bit to Biopic traits in the structure and pacing, but the focus on Abel and Donovan keeps us invested and interested. In the catalogue of films by Hanks and Spielberg, this movie stands at the higher end of those scales. It's a great, quiet war film, with a great, quiet, resilient character at the centre.",8,1,3,8 December 2015
Captain America: Civil War," This...is...AWESOME! Best MCU film by far!
","I saw this last night, in a mostly packed theatre, knowing almost nothing about this movie. Literally, I only know what was in the trailers, so everything was fresh and cool to me.The action scenes were intense as hell; whether it be the actual Civil War, or the opening scenes involving the taking out of Crossbones and his gang of mercenaries, the stuntwork and kinetic feel of the fight scenes were great. The final fight of Captain America and Bucky vs Iron Man was brutal, low down and hugely varied. The Russo brothers certainly did a good job of keeping the Marvel film humour - and this movie does have a lot of humour about it - whilst still giving it a darker tone compared to the other films, and this kept it watchable; THIS is what I wish Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice was like.Speaking of that film, this movie gets one thing better than any MCU before it: it's villain. OH. MY. GOD. Daniel Bruhl is here playing Helmut Zemo, a big villain in the Captain America comics but with a re-designed backstory. This version of the character has a more sympathetic motive than the comic Zemo, but he's still threatening as hell. Bruhl moves with a measured, quiet intensity, but he talks like he's full of rage and threat. The first scene we see is one when he interrogates an officer involved in the Winter Soldier program and brutally drowns him when he's done. He plans everything down to the wire, but not like it's absurd. This is a great character, and I'm glad we'll get to see more of Zemo in later films.Other new characters introduced include Black Panther and the new Spider Man, and these were characters that I could easily get behind, especially Tom Holland as the brand new Peter Parker. He's funny, awkward, wise-cracking when it's appropriate AND he looks the part. Chadwick Boseman is also cool as Black Panther, who looks ultra intimidating when he's first on screen.The nature of the conflict here is cool; I was on Team Iron Man, but regardless of who's side you're on, you'll find yourself questioning which side is actually right. It's a movie that does have themes about terrorism in the modern times, but STILL is enjoyable.Guys, SEE THIS. Really? You're still reading this? GO AND SEE IT!",10,5,13,1 May 2016
Room," Great adaptation of a fantastic novel; deeply affecting
","Because of me being an idiot, I finished reading the book Room literally an hour before I saw the movie. The good side of this was the novel was still in my head, but the bad side was also that the novel was still very much in my head. Usually when this happens, you become critical as you constantly go 'Where's this bit? Where's that bit?'. The novel is pretty intact with this adaptation, and is also a pretty much perfect adaptation.A lot of Jack's internal monologues are narrowed down, obviously as this is a visual medium and not a novel where you can get away with this, and this shows how Emma Donaghue takes over lovingly crafted novel and makes it work with a film format. And when she has produced the script with the same tone and sensibility, albeit with some scenes appearing slightly shortened (notably the interview scene, which in the book brought me to tears and felt a little hastened here), she gives that script to very talented people to bring to life. Irish director Lenny Abrahamson shoots the movie with very tight shots - around 80% of the shots are ECUs or CUs, which is mixed with a cooler pallet to make the world seem cold, and as the movie ends, we see a final wide shot of our two main characters walking from the camera to give a great resolve. It's a very tight, clever piece of storytelling with camera-work. The cast are also stellar. Joan Allen features prominently as Jack's grandmother, and is great as a woman who's trying her best to warm to and love Jack whilst also making her own daughter's return to the world more accessible and is great, Tom McCamus plays 'steppa' Leo who is the first person to really coax Jack out of his shell, and uses his warming and caring voice, and subtle, gentle expressions to gain his affection. Sean Bridgers plays Old Nick, the captor and creator of Room; Sean Bridgers deserves a lot of credit for being genuinely repulsive, despite only being seen a small number of scenes, and for creating a quiet unassuming quality about him - that no-one would ever expect him - while also being horrifically calm with everything he's done. Now onto the main players: Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson has come a long way since Envy Adams in Scott Pilgrim, and she creates a TOTALLY realistic portrayal of a traumatised woman who is also a genuinely loving person/parent. In her already mentioned interview scene, where she's asked horrifically insensitive questions to provoke, your heart breaks for her. As Jack, Jacob is our eyes of the movie as we follow him wherever he goes, and he's so adorable yet wise in his way; he says things like his 'strong' is in his hair, like Samson, and you find it utterly adorable and endearing at the same time. He is really good, and it's good he is because if he wasn't then whole movie fails.I can't think of any flaws with the movie at all actually, and if there are they are pretty minor. There are obviously differences with the novel, which is always frustrating BUT as a movie, this is perfect. Brie Larson is particularly wonderful, as is the script and the minimalistic movie score. Hopefully Oscar for Brie, and all around good things for this movie.",10,0,5,18 January 2016
Midsommar," Kind of a tough film to review, but easy to rate highly
","Last year, Ari Aster wrote, produced and directed Herditary, which I saw in cinemas and I had a good time with, up until the end. Admittedly, a large amount had to do with me seeing this with an audience of mostly people that weren't engaged in that kind of horror, but also a lot was due to the film kind of wrote itself into a corner by telling you how it was going to end about 20 minutes before it did, and also containing a lot of unintentionally funny moments that kind of ruined the mood.I bring this up because I was curious to see how this movie would be different. And it was substantially so; first of all, this movie a lot lighter and contains a lot more scope than Hereditary that was so much based around that darkly lit house, and it does use that contrast well in making the landscapes of Sweden seem somewhat idyllic and a great place to be. The grander scope of the cast does actually give Ari a greater focus, impressively. He does have some funny moments, but this time they are more intentional, and therefore don't detract from the story. This is especially evident in the film's ending, which is far more subtle, sinister, and grounded than in Hereditary, whilst also continuing to make excellent use of a soundtrack that is both uplifting and dissonant at the same time.From the acting, everyone is mostly solid; Will Poulter (arguably the most well known of the cast with the least to do) is a good comic foil for the group, Jack Reynor is great as this distant, somewhat-of-a-prick boyfriend character who is integral to the main theme of the story, which I'll cover in a second, and there are great secondary bit parts in as well. However, both Florence Pugh as Dani, who I've always rated highly as a versatile and intelligent, subtle actress, and who shines in a role that could otherwise have been very monotonous and unlikable, and also Swedish actor Vilhelm Blongren as Pelle, are the true stars. I think they are both early frontrunners for Oscars, especially Blongren, who really does a great job in a role that easily could've been a one dimensional villain, but instead becomes a vision into the future for Dani, and is doing these clearly wrong things, but due to his alliance with the Cult, views it as anything but; because of this, his presence within the story was deeply unnerving.Now, one important thing to note here, and it's something that knowing about after the film made me appreciate it so much more. This movie is marketed as a cult horror film, but in Aster's own words, this is a break-up movie dressed as a cult horror movie - much like Shaun of the Dead is a Rom-Com dressed as a zombie horror but obviously way more subtle here. The central relationship here, between Dani and Reynor's Christian, is terrible, and throughout it becomes increasingly more obviously broken up, and to see the way it leads towards the ending, it was easy to feel unnerved for how it unfolds - especially as it taps into a major fear of mine - but also points to both of each character's major flaws, in that Dani is looking for affection and Christian is someone who looks to take advantage of people. This fulcrum point for all the horror to revolve around is probably the thing the film does the best, but something that has been underplayed in the advertising, which is a mistake as knowing about it does improve the film significantly in my eyes.My recommendation, go see this film. Best part is the film is rated 18 here in the UK, which helped me enjoy the film a lot as there's less chance of young groups of kids being there, and there is a lot of intense gore as well. If that's your kind of thing as well, of course.",9,15,36,5 July 2019
La La Land," A great passion project that is also an epic movie on its own
","Regardless of what you feel over the Oscars mishap, I will say outright that I do like this film, a lot. The scope of it, visually as well as harmonically, is immense; this is especially apparent in both the opening 'Another Day of Sun' musical sequence that is 5 minute of uncut, intensely intricate dancing, and then on the Museum date which is almost dreamy with how the visuals and the sound design merges.In terms of plot, this film does have some similarities with Damien Chazelle's last film, the musical-themed psychological thriller Whiplash, in that you have a jazz musician who is hell-bent on making it in the world, and by the end both him and his love interest do make it (more on this later). Ryan Gosling in this film acts way better than he sings, that I can say for certain, as a lot of times he is out of key and his voice doesn't suit a lot of the songs he does, but his acting is great; the scene where he begs for his job back is both serious and keeps the light-heartedness that the film does try and maintain. Emma Stone in her Oscar-winning role here is by far the better singer and dancer of the two, and her performance as Mia is very expressive and eager, and also fun. John Legend has a good supporting role too as a former friend of Sebastian (Gosling) who he recruits into his pop band, much to Seb's reluctance.The soundtrack and the set design's are big and broad and totally awesome. Aside from Gosling, a lot of the vocals are strong, and I was a bit disappointed in the lack of JK Simmons as Seb's old boss - I mean, he was amazing in Whiplash, and is also a professional vocalist, use it! The ending is where the film does kind of fall down flat. Much like The Grand Budapest Hotel, which is amazing, this film contains an ending that gets way too emotional way too fast. We see Seb and Mia talk, then a caption '5 years later' comes on screen, and we see Mia is married with a young daughter to an older man, and they visit a jazz bar in the evening, owned by Seb. They lock eyes, and imagine how if everything had gone completely their way what would've happened. It's a great musical number that ends, very dourly, on Mia and her husband leaving, with Mia and Seb exchanging one last look. It's just such a big leap with so much different in 5 years that you have no time to process it, and it spits in the face of a lot of the film. And it is a shame because narratively, the film was good up to that point.Nevertheless, it is still an extremely enjoyable movie with good songs and direction that will make you want to keep watching it on repeat viewings. The ending just keeps it from being perfect though.",8,0,4,7 April 2017
Don't Breathe," Almost perfect. Undoubtedly tense as hell!
","Picture the scene: the production house logos have just passed, and we cut to an aerial shot of Detroit of our villain - Norman, 'The Blind Man' as played by Stephen Lang - dragging a bloody girl down the street, constantly zooming down, soundtrack buzzing, scary as hell. And it doesn't really let up until the end.The movie's 4 main cast are great, the only annoying one being Money who is the guy who plans everything and is a total dick about it, but he gets killed fairly soon so I can easily forget about it, and it was well acted so yes. The Blind Man, who it turns out is absolutely nowhere near as helpless as he first appeared, is easily one of the best villains of the year. He's got the right look, of an old man but stupidly well built for it, grizzled and intimidating as hell, great performance here. The two, Suburgatory's Jane Levy, who is very different person here and not least because of her blonde hair, makes for a character who is morally dubious but I still want to support, and the same can be said for Alex Minnette's character also called Alex.This movie's biggest strength is that is, at first, knows it's limits. The weak villain makes him real, and so when Rocky (Levy) and Alex are running from him, it gives them even grounding to an extent and the scares have more effect, and in the part in the trailer where the lights are turned off in the basement and he chases them with a gun in the dark, it's impossibly tense. Literally, in a large amount of this film I was holding my breath. There was also a surprising lack of jump scares, or when they were, it was the arrival of something dangerous i.e the Blind Man or his vicious dog. The sound design of the film was really great; how the sound was heightened really gave a feeling of how 'loud' they are.The thing that keeps the movie from being a 10 from me, is that in the final 7-15 minutes, it feels like a part that should've stayed in the first draft of the script. Don't get me wrong, it does result in two great action set pieces, but it goes past a point where it does raise a good moral quandary of 'who's the real bad guy here?' and becomes a bit over blown and this is enforced by a bizarre bit of sequel baiting that felt odd. If you like it, fine, and it certainly didn't kill this competent and tense as hell thriller masterclass. So yes, certainly one of the best horror thrillers this year, go see Don't Breathe!",9,4,10,11 September 2016
The Disaster Artist," 'You're tearing me apart, Lisa!', 'I did not hit her', 'I definately have breast cancer' and more, brought to life on the big screen
","This movie is amazing. I just want to state that as a blanket statement that is movie, much as Tim Burton's Ed Wood that I also love, sends up terrible filmmaking but also manages to get to the person underneath those terrible movies.Obviously, whilst Ed Wood was based on Ed Wood's life of making many films, such as Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster building up to Plan 9 from Outer Space, and it makes it specifically it clear that this was a work of passion that was worked hard to make happen, this movie is based solely on the making of The Room - and casts a very different kind of persona at the centre of it.The screenplay - whilst it doesn't include everything from Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell's award winning book of the same name, and couldn't since there's so much content in that book it would take a 6 episode mini-series to cover all of it - does very articulately communicate how chaotic the behinds-the-scenes of the movie was, and keep humour going even when it borders into actual, genuine danger for the cast and crew. It also makes it clear, although it doesn't border the point on - which is good filmmaking, as it allows you to craft your own thoughts - is that in comparison to Ed Wood, who put his entire lifeforce into making his so called disasterpieces, the same can't be said for Wiseau, as at every step and turn he just pays for everything because he's so rich and can afford it, and his ultimate fame is ultimately anything but hard work. In order to balance that with a funny, engaging, rewatchable film is quite an achievement, which it more than manages.The best things about this movie BY FAR is the performances, particularly from James Franco, who has a massive challenge in trying to bring to life a guy who is not only as much of a cartoon as you can imagine, but also that no-one actually knows anything about - Tommy Wiseau isn't even his real name - and brings the person to the forefront. In one particular scene, where Tommy is completely naked and yelling at everyone for everything you could imagine, it runs the gambit of funny, terrifying, douchey, vulnerable, terrifying, back to funny again, and really helps make this one of Franco's strongest performances alongside 127 Hours, Spring Breakers and Milk.Dave Franco and Seth Rogen also help the film keep it's tone. Rogen does great at doing what he does best - speak for the audience it seems, in the moment. Sandy, as the script supervisor, is someone who gets the best arguments with Wiseau as the most experienced filmmaker on the crew, who will mention things the audience will see and think, like 'Why's he having sex with her belly button?' or pull up the infamous laugh in Mark's domestic abuse story. He is kind of underused a bit, as is most of the cast, but with a cast that big, it is likely to happen; pretty much, it's the case of the cast is spread a mile wide but an inch deep, although all of them do get a chance to shine for a moment.Dave Franco does a solid job here; he is very much the POV character here, as the movie is framed kind of like how Foxcatcher frames John Du Pont, or The Last King of Scotland frames Idi Amin, like this this Wiseau. When we watch Greg through this movie, we do get a fully realised sense of why these two would be friends, and why after everything they'd still be doing all this stuff for each other. Greg also gets a lot of compelling scenes with Tommy, the other cast, his girlfriend Amber (played by Dave Franco's wife Allison Brie), and the best cameo in a movie full of cameos, Bryan Cranston as himself.I really enjoyed this movie; there are issues, but they don't ruin the whole movie but just detract a little bit, whether that be pacing, or falling too much into a biopic trope (namely the Greg and Tommy fight near the end), and certainly don't make the film any less funny or rewatchable.",9,0,1,15 December 2017
Mudbound," Yes, I'm going to be that guy. Sorry
","I've seen a lot of reviews of this movie, and all of them have been climbing over one another to say how much they love this film. It's pretty much been a case of this movie is the sole contender for bet picture this year. So, it is some shame that I come here and say that after watching it right now, it is a bit over-hyped. Obviously just my opinion.Firstly, I want to mention the things I wasn't too keen on. The biggest one - BY FAR - is the fact that there are so many narrative voices, and the narration is so frequent and so invasive that it started to grate on my nerves a lot. It also doesn't help that the narration contains very anecdotal stories that don't serve too much of the plot, and is a case of 'show don't tell' being ignored. There is a large portion of the film when the narration goes away, and I was happy, and then it came back and I was just annoyed all over again. The more constructive problem is that this constant infighting of narrative voice keeps the film from having a clear Protagonist, and so for the first hour and a bit before the focus moves to Jamie and Ronsel, you feel very pulled in all directions, and very disengaged sometimes.Secondly, something that I will admit is both a blessing and a curse is that director Dee Rees has a very realistic style of directing in terms of the world's physics around it, so the light is all natural within scenes ala The Revenant so to speak. The drawback to a lot of this is that there are scenes shot at night that are so lowly lit that you can't see a f***ing thing that's going on. There's one scene this works fantastically, which is one of the best shots of the year, but aside from that, it's really hard. There's also some slight jarring from the film's score which is mostly absent and then comes in like a wrecking ball, and it's really abrupt and kind of kills the mood.Thirdly, somewhat less importantly, is that the film has a very vague sense of time passing, to the point where I can only tell that 9 months has passed because someone has been born, but there's nothing else to indicate that in relation to everything else.Lastly, whilst a lot of the cast do more than pull their weight, there are also some players that don't. Particularly, Carey Mulligan and Jason Clarke continue a trend with their work, which is that when they are not being passionate about the role, they kind of sleep it through. This is common with Mulligan, who will give performances like An Education, Suffragette, Shame and Drive, but then in a large amount of other roles, be bland as hell. Jason Clarke likewise, will be a charismatic confident leader in things like Lawless, Zero Dark Thirty and Everest, but then will do this when he is largely distant.And now, this is when I point out that I do like this film, a lot. It is a long movie, but I did keep going with the elements I didn't like to see where they led, and they led to a fantastic final 45 minutes. Everything has led up to this point, and this culminates in one of the most uplifting final shots of a movie this year, and a haunting scene involving the KKK and a trio of amazing actors. This scene, led by Garrett Hedlund, Jonathan Banks and Jason Mitchell give it their all in a scene that reminded me a lot of the 12 Years a Slave soap scene. Mary J. Blige is also fantastic as well, and those 4 really hold the cast together, moreso with Jason Mitchell who is one of the most exciting new actors around, and who in this movie really makes a statement for Best Supporting Actor. So do Hedlund and Banks, but Mitchell is amazing.So I don't regret watching this movie; just don't like it as much as others do, but I am very happy I saw it.",7,13,33,22 November 2017
Whiplash," A damn intense, relatable movie!
","This movie speaks to me on two levels: both in the kinaesthesia of having a movie about the making of music AND as a well-made movie. I found out this movie only cost 3.3 million to make (including promo). I say this because it is shot AND edited more professionally and properly than most movie with a budget 30 times higher.Everything about this is amazing. The script is written with memorable moments and set-ups, such as Andrew's break-up with Nicole that serves as allegory to his unhealthy devotion to Shafer Studio Band, the dinner table and of course the now infamous 'rushing or dragging' scene, which I frequently refer back to with some of my students. I teach guitar, so it's a little different. The soundtrack too is amazing, and I would recommend buying that along with the movie. Acting from the cast is above and beyond, mainly from Miles Teller who shows a passion and intensity I didn't see from many characters in 2014, Paul Reiser as his supporting yet unexceptional dad and Glee's Melissa Beniot as Nicole, his girlfriend whom he seems to be less focused on than the drumming.This brings to the ONE thing that this movie will be famous for the years to come. It's two words: J.K Simmons (could technically be three I guess?). This guy who has been the reliable, dependable good actor for 20 years brings his character acting chops in bags for this role. The character Terence Fletcher is utterly quotable, memorable but more than that, he seems real. This could easily have been a one-dimensional yeller but J.K brings him far enough into that mode to be threatening and cajoling to Andrew but also seem humane enough that when he finds out about Sean Casey's death the tears are real, or when he opens up to Andrew about his success in bringing the best from people, he is empathetic. Finally, at the end of the AMAZING Caravan performance at the end of the movie (which is edited, mixed and shot perfectly), the approval that Fletcher gives feels earned and we are happy for it: if we did not get those emotions, then the movie wouldn't have worked.Whiplash ROCKS! I recommend that you rush (not drag) out and buy it just before it comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray.",9,1,3,18 May 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A beautiful, unamitaged mess. But it is really beautiful
","Just a preface, I haven't seen Man Of Steel, mainly because I disagreed with the concept of making a dark Superman - not because Superman can't be in 'dark stories the way Batman is', because a lot of the time he is - but because of Superman's super-powered boy scout personality makes him as dark seem inappropriate. Nevertheless, I saw this because I love Batman and I love his story lines, and I can say without a doubt that the Batman stuff in this movie is the best things in it.There are three positives that I can truly get behind: Ben Affleck and his performance as both Bruce Wayne AND Batman, the music score, and the action scenes. Everything else is super mishandled.The biggest problem with this movie is that it seems that Zack Snyder, David S. Goyer AND even Christopher Nolan came up with absolutely nothing close to the characters they were creating, and one particular character comes off REALLY bad: Lex Luthor, in this movie, is a F***ING JOKE! I know they were going for something different, but this feels like a really cynical attempt to be a Heath Ledger as The Joker type thing. However, whilst The Joker was a original take on the old classic character, he still retained the trademark characteristics and fitted in the Universe. Eisenberg's Lex doesn't, and it cripples the film. Is he a scheming genius? Kind of, but his plan is so contrived that doesn't fit. Is a charming man? Nowhere near. Is he bald? At the end of the film, yes, but the rest of the time his hair is even longer than normal. Is he confident? Actually they take this too far - this Lex is fearless as hell, but it borders on Joker levels of fearlessness, and that was also distracting. Does he think super far ahead for every outcome? NO; he makes Doomsday to kill Superman, without ANY plan for what would happen if Doomsday won. In fact, Doomsday's first thing is to attack Lex but Superman stops him. It's not totally Jesse's fault, as this is the character they were going for, but if so, an actor like Joseph Gordon-Levitt would've been someone who CAN portray charm, scheming and confidence.Superman is also poorly handed, as Henry Cavill gives no charm or charisma to the character, who also acts totally outside of the Superman way. He has no reason to be angry that Batman kills, because in one scene, he flies a guy in jeans and a t-shirt through a brick wall to save Lois. Fact: that guy died. This is a movie made for the fans, but it falls apart so quickly under analysis from even the passing viewer: it drags too much, characters aren't really the characters and the casting choices were so bizarre - but to be fair, two of those casting decisions worked well, one of them didn't. They mishandle so many thing about the film, including the ending, which didn't have the emotional weight behind it that it needed. But I am glad I saw it - I just wish I liked it more than I did.",4,2,5,1 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," So insane, so good, so intense - SO worth the hype.
","Disclaimer: the reason this is an 8 and not a full 10 is purely because I found some nitpicky things with the world building, and also because it was a bit too intense and non-stop for me. Please don't kill me for this.I have seen the first Mad Max and the majority of the second. Didn't see the third, but the first two were amazing as part of an amazing series worth a 30 year wait for this latest insane installment. Seriously, the action in this movie - both fight scenes and car chases - is some of the best I've ever seen, if not THE best. Action scenes shot the way they should be; with proper choreography, shot in a way that creates intense moments where the hero is invariably struggling and being victorious - just like a real situation. Max has always been a hero that deals with injuries and set-backs in ways that would actually happen and its great to see of that happening here.Speaking of Max, we have a new actor in the lead role, partly because Mel Gibson is now almost unhirable, but mostly because he is now too old. Replacing him however is someone perfect for it: Tom Hardy. If you read my Child 44 review, you'll know that whilst I hated the movie, I commended Hardy for rising above the s**t script to give a performance that was pretty much brilliant inspite of everything. In Mad Max though, he gets less lines to work with, but his body language says all: gruff, tough, angry, not a hero willing to care or show any humanity towards others and being at his best in dangerous situations. The most character development is shown by Nux, played by Nicholas Hoult, who starts off as an anti-villain but later becomes a sympathetic, lonely, broken man who helps the heroes after he builds a relationship with one of the brides.One character who is receiving HUGE buzz is Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron. Bold, tough, determined in her mission to rescue to brides from the movie's terrifying villain Immortal Joe in a non-stop drive to the 'green land', Theron plays a character who is not a typical 'I'm affected by a terrible path' type of heroine and brings a matter of fact toughness purpose to the role that make this the best work she's done since Monster.In terms of the story, it is pretty much what you read above: the main plot is Furiosa helping the wives of Immortal Joe escape from his people the War Boys who have captured and enslaved Max at the start of the film, and Max tries to get revenge whilst ending up helping Furiosa. The few breaks inbetween the intense action are great as they set-up the others breaking down the barrier between them and Max and getting him involved in their mission. It's hard to talk about the breaks because, honestly, there aren't that many and most development actually comes through the fight scenes, which is amazing to even say.My only words for you - SEE THIS MOVIE! It deserves your full attention, and if you don't, you'll regret it!",8,3,8,19 May 2015
Alien: Covenant," All the wrong decisions, both within and outside of the film
","Obviously, it's fair to say that a large amount of directors have been privileged to have a crack at the Alien franchise - there's been the fantastic James Cameron with Aliens, the exceptional David Fincher with Alien 3 that while he hates that film I thought was fine, and French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet with assistance from Joss Whedon with Alien Resurrection. However, Ridley Scott was the first and is the most infamous, and in terms of franchise, I would say that Alien is strong: I liked the first, loved the second, was fine with the third and the fourth is garbage, but fun garbage.I was then really looking forward to Prometheus when I saw it in cinemas and was very disappointed with it, for its idiotic characters, lack of focus, expository dialogue and audience insulting antics of stupid science in the infamous caesarean scene, or just straight up refusing to answer any questions.With this film, I hoped that a lot of my questions would be answered, or that Ridley would fix a lot of the issues. He does not. In my opinion, this is only mildly better than Prometheus: whilst Prometheus starts strong and gets weaker as it goes on, Covenant gets better, but not my much.Oh, by the way, James Franco's in this movie. Yep. True, he blows up after 20 seconds and in a part that could've been played by the second unit directors brother, but he's there.The very telling fact about this movie is that Ridley Scott took the wrong advice away from Prometheus and has pretty much decided with this film to forget all about it. We know this because there both the interviews where he says this, and also the fact that they literally nuke everything set-up in the last film. And it causes more confusion than answers AGAIN! Seriously, in Prometheus, the Engineers made the Xenomorphs, but apparently not because in this, David from the last film is the real creator of the Xenomorphs. And Shaw, who I was quite interested in following, is killed offscreen by David which felt really cheap.Speaking of cheap, the characterisation of EVERYONE in this film outside of Michael Fassbender's exceptional portrayals the androids David and Walter and a few others, is so non-descript that it goes beyond lazy. Most of the time, I had to Wikipedia for names afterwards because everyone is referred to as 'my wife' or 'my husband' SO GODDAMN OFTEN you will know no-one by name. The only real exception, and the only fully formed character is, to my massive surprise, Danny McBride as the ships captain, Tennessee, as has the distinction of a personality - he's a hard drinking, driven professional who will go to great lengths to save the crew when serious s**t goes down. By contrast, Katherine Waterston, who plays 'Not Ripley' Daniels, is wasted: she comes alive for the action scenes, but there's only two that she's involved in for the final act. Apart from that, Daniels is a boring bland stand-in for Ripley or even Shaw. Then everyone is either meant to die, or just too stupid to live. Here's the level of characterisation, Demian Bichir is in the film, and his character is gay - I know this because Wikipedia told me, as did the prequel YouTube short. By the way, why do I have to watch YouTube shorts BEFORE I watch a film rather than just put the footage in the film? At least DC gives us all the stuff that should've gone in after the fact, but not before!Within this, however, there's an interesting idea of David becoming this Frankenstein that makes the Xenomorphs, and Michael Fassbender is as great in this as Prometheus as he gives both of these films a better performance than they deserve. Here it is: Engineers made Humans, Humans made David, David destroys the Engineers. Humans made David, David made Xenomorphs, Xemomorphs destroy Humans. It's an idea that is interesting, but is screwed because it's the secondary focus, when really, if this movie was told solely from David's POV, it would've been so much more interesting. You see him create, scheme, and it would've added actual tension to the ending that is so obvious you can see it 45 minutes before the end.So, what else? If you thought Prometheus had a dumb crew, wait till you see these guys. They venture forth, onto an unknown planet, and when they land, they wear NO protective gear. This would've literally made the whole movie pointless if they had. THEN when a Neomorph - first generation - attacks the ship, two crew members slip over in blood, which was ridiculous and then one blows up the ship with a shotgun. Then, you have the stupidest sequence of events, with the idiot Captain and designated exposition dumper Oram, played by Billy Crudup (who is wasted here) at the centre, in an event that leads to a moment that reminded me way too much of the Spaceballs movie. Then the ending, which is really obvious, could've been avoided by doing basic checks on the androids to check which is which.There is some good things in the film: namely the character David is wonderful, Fassbender is great as always, the action scene in the final act when they are hunting the Xenomorph on the ship is intense, and the acting from Waterston is strong despite her character, and she has good scenes with McBride. It's well scored, the CGI is alright. I can't say its a not a mess, but I wouldn't tell anyone not to see it. It's certainly an experience; make of that what you will.",4,4,8,13 July 2017
