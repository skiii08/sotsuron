","I didn't cry, but tears welled up three times... the funny thing was that there were enough goofy funny bits to make you feel a little silly about crying, but I'll tell you, the tears were there, ready to go... check it out, it'll make you at least a little emotional... I went with an old friend, and she kept looking at me to see if I was crying... I was about to but the funny parts kept me okay... it's a touching film and it's worth the money to see... flat out, and that's said in a time where most movies are too focused on shock-value... and of course we can see Sandler as a fish-handler and vet!  He always comes off as the guy who you talked to yesterday, a next door neighboor, an old friend... that's his whole appeal... so he totally pulls it off and Drew is a great quirky charming irrisistable girl to play the part of Lucy (wonder if they got the name from Lucy in the sky with diamonds?)...  check this film out, you won't regret it...",Null,0,0,21 March 2004
