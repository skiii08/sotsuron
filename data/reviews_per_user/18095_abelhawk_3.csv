The Benchwarmers," Who's the audience?
","I liked this when it came out and I was a teen, but now that I'm older, I realize why it bombed so hard. It doesn't have a clear audience. The jokes and acting are cheesy and juvenile, and the main moral of the story is aimed to be inspirational, urging the audience to avoid bullying, help children get a chance to try and win, winning isn't everything, etc., as if it's a family movie. And yet, the movie is littered with mature jokes, crude humor, bad attitudes, and profanityâ€” things no self-respecting parent would want to let their children partake of. It's got a handful of jokes in it, but its message, no matter its importance in real life, is lost.",4,0,3,12 May 2017
Disturbia," It's okay, I guess.
","It was an exciting premise, but my problem with it was that it was fascinating and riveting for the entire beginning and middle of the film, but the ending seemed too rushed and didn't feel satisfying.",5,4,5,20 May 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Sloppy and above all, unnecessary
","I don't see why Disney feels like they have to make live action remakes of their classics just FOR THE SAKE OF making live action remakes of their classics. This film had 0 innovation, was essentially a poorly-acted scene-for-scene remake of the animated version, and just didn't have an ounce of the magic of the old classic. Emma Watson was a very unconvincing Belle. The beast looked utterly fake—like Snapshot-filter fake. I've seen better CGI in old 90s movies. The 'humor' was tasteless, the twists on the songs were ridiculous, and there always seemed to be too many extras on screen at the same time, as if no one in the film had a life but to be watching the main plot unfold—it was almost exactly like a live musical of the original Beauty in the Beast with bad CGI and without the charm of an actual live performance. And for a story that takes place in mid-1700s France, there were TOO MANY black people in this film! I'm not being racist at all, I'm simply wishing that the film had enough dignity to be historical. It would be odd for a movie that takes place in India to have Caucasian and Asian people in it, so why did they feel the need to make mid-1700s France look like South Africa?Above everything else wrong with this anathema of a movie, this film was utterly and exhaustingly predictable. I knew exactly what was going to happen in every single beat of the film. Why was this film made? The classic is always going to be the best, so why dress people up in CGI clothes and costumes and make them recite lines from it again? There is no reason for anyone to watch this movie. It is redundant and soulless, and an enormous waste of time.",1,5,14,30 September 2017
