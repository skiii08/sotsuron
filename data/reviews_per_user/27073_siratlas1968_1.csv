Despicable Me 2," A defense of Al Pacino
","Looks like that this animated full-length film by Illumination Entertainment became successful thanks to Al Pacino's 'creative differences'. On the other hand, the voice of Eduardo/El Macho sounds like an animated character from a Latin American cartoon and definitely not the real Al Pacino voice I expected for a while. Actually, I supported him, but someone else became the voice of Eduardo/El Macho. Was Al Pacino as the voice of Eduardo/El Macho a deception from Illumination Entertainment? Or it was just a lie? I have no idea, but any attempt to make an animated or a video game character with Al Pacino's voice failed. Anyway, I support Al Pacino's ambitions as a voice actor.",8,0,0,20 July 2015
