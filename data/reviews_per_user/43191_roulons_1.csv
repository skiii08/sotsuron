The Devil's Advocate," Mesmerizing movie, Keanu, ending.....possible spoiler
","This film is captivating!  Like it or not, you won't walk away from it.
I disagree with many of the Keanu comments here, as I think he was perfect for this role.  Not all actors are as animated as a Pacino or Nicholson, but isn't that real life?THE Ending:  Disappointing to the point of betrayal, similar to the way I felt at the end of the Wizard of Oz.Still, this is a powerhouse movie; if you haven't seen it, get busy!",Null,0,1,15 February 2004
