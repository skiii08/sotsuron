Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Very Original
","What Borat accomplishes is exactly what it appears it was designed to be: A mock-umentary poking fun at as many different American cultural aspects as possible. While some may regard some of the humor as crude, racist, immature and sexist it does so in total jest and with a sense of originality. Unlike many other comedies featuring crude humour: 'oldschool' or 'Jackass', Borat presents its humor in a manner which doesn't make you feel as if you've seen it all before but with slightly different punch lines and actors. Now, I have read quite a few comments which have stated things like 'some of the jokes made me want to leave the cinema' and while I sympathize with those who felt offended by the humor on a personal level (such as someone from Kazakhstan might) I believe that the crudeness of the jokes are what makes them so hilarious. Those who did not enjoy the humor in this movie should stick to watching 'Blackadder' and other British commedies with audience laughter dubbed over to 'remind you whats funny and whats not'",8,0,4,10 November 2007
