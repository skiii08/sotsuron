Angels & Demons," A demonic waste of time and resources
","In short: this film simply does not work. It fails to engage and involve on every level. There is not a hint of character development, and the one-dimensional characters are little more than generic transporters of a weak and diluted plot.It is almost impossible not to compare with the book when trying to understand why this movie fails so badly. The book may not be great literature, and it also suffers from a weak plot and poor character development (though nowhere near as badly as the film), but it still manages to be exactly what it sets out to be: page turning entertainment. The book is highly readable entertainment whereas the movie is, for lack of a better word, boring. Fast paced, but nonetheless boring.We've seen it before: a fast paced story with lots of physical activity does not equal real action. On some level, we need to understand the characters and what drives them in order to get involved with the action. Furthermore, we need to be able to follow the story, and the action must make sense in this story, and carry it somewhere. Who hasn't already seen lots of fights, car chases and explosions? On their own, they are nothing new or exciting. It is only when we understand who is fighting/chasing whom, and why, that the action becomes meaningful and interesting. Story action is so much more than just elaborate stunts and CGI. It is about producing curiosity, dispensing information, character development and providing surprise. In Angels & Demons, we get none of that. We get to watch Tom Hanks jumping from one clue and its conclusion to the next at breathtaking speed, but it produces as much excitement as having last years lotto numbers read out at double speed.There is a huge difference between a fast paced STORY and just fast pace...In essence, watching Angels & Demons is similar to watching someone you don't know play a computer game.Spare yourself the experience and save the money.",Null,17,47,18 May 2009
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Solace - a disappointing mess
","To give this film an 'Awful' rating might seem overly harsh, but to me this is truly one of the worst movies, not to mention greatest disappointments ever. I hardly ever walk out of movies, but this time I needed real will power to remain in my seat.After the excellent 'Casino Royale', my hopes were high that the follow-up would at the very least offer good action entertainment. On might argue that the new interpretation of Bond in Casino Royale was more Bourne than Bond, but irrespective of that it was a solid piece of action craftsmanship with a decent plot.In contrast, 'Quantum of Solace', is a horrifically inept attempt at creating 'action' through music-video-style editing. The entire movie is chopped into 15 to 60 frame cuts (each one to two seconds, a new camera angle). A highly annoying practice that greatly distracts you from following the plot (had there been one of any merit). Even the dialog scenes suffer from these continuous cuts. Try this: while watching the movie, count 'one, two, three...' for every scene. See how often, if ever, you get past two. To add insult to injury, the action scenes have been shot with a number of shaking hand cams that, in conjunction with the constant cuts, produce a complete visual mess.The shooting and editing ruin this film to such an extent that script, plot, dialog and character development hardly matter. Just as well since all are remarkably poor. Never have Bond characters been more one-dimensional and wooden, feeling more like computer game characters than real people.Quantum of Solace is a sad example of form over substance, and very bad form over virtually no substance in this particular case.Maybe Marc Foster was trying to do something 'new' for the sake of being different. Maybe he thinks that a multitude of fast cuts and shaky shots equals 'action'. He's wrong.What he has created can best be described as a 106 minute long MTV Video of a computer game.What a shame!",Null,6,10,10 November 2008
