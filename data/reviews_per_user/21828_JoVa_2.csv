The Blair Witch Project," What a horror movie should be
","Most people who see this movie will either love it or hate it.  The movie is completely psychological in its terror, which is, I think, much stronger and disturbing on a basic level than the drivel which passes as horror films today.  If your idea of scary is someone in a raincoat/hockey mask/cheap halloween costume graphically killing teenagers with a hook/machete/garden weasel, then this movie isn't for you -- wait until the next installment of 'Scream if you Know What I Did The Last Time I Had A Nightmare when Halloween fell on Friday the 13th' comes out.  If, on the other hand, your idea of scary involves projecting yourself into the characters and sharing the psychological terror they experience, see this movie.  You won't be disappointed.",10,1,2,2 August 1999
Fargo," The worst movie I've ever seen
","Without question, the worst movie I've ever seen.  It isn't an issue of style - I like Tarantino movies, for example - but one of quality.  The plot was unimaginative, the characters insipid (which I hate to say, because I like William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi otherwise)  and the writing weak at best.  There was no flow to the story, if it could be called that.  The film was so bad, in fact, that we almost shut it off in the middle and took it back to the video store early - and I sat through all of 'Jacob's Ladder'.An associate of mine suggested the appeal was the constant juxtaposition of the absurd and the banal, but that's how it felt - like the writers sat there and said, 'if we juxtapose the absurd and banal, it'll be a great movie.'  Completely forced and artificial.Their idea of what midwesterners sound like was pulled from thin air. Having lived in the midwest all my life, I can honestly say I've never heard anyone speak like that before.  It's not an issue of being offended, it just wasn't accurate.As it is, I would not recommend this movie for anyone for any reason.  There were absolutely no redeeming qualities to it whatsoever.",1,17,43,17 March 1999
