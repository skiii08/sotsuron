The Ring," Creepy NOT Scary
","I don't think I'm alone in saying this was really confusing and just a jumbled mess. I mean, I didn't feel as if the scenes tied the story together. Like Brave Sir Robin said, there's lots of side plots that have no relevance. Personally, I didn't even get the ending. Yes, the girl coming through the TV - and her face - made me wince, but what I didn't get was why Rachel and Aidan survive just by watching a different copy of the tape?I mean the film overall is creepy, NOT scary. I think some have mistaken the differences. Maybe it's a possibility that I just don't get the heebie-jeebies easily. The only movie that makes me pee my pants is 'The Exorcist' and this does not, by far, even compare in the slightest. Especially considering what occurred in 'The Exorcist' has been reported as actually happening, whereas this is so unbelievable and fictitious.I might have enjoyed it more by not having the expectations that it was one of the most horrifying films of the past 10 years or something. I'd recommend that if you do see this, just take it in how YOU want to. Maybe you'll like it, who knows. But I personally don't plan to watch it again in the near future. AND I get the feeling this has sequel written all over it, due to the ending and the enormous success (which I'm sure the film company would love to duplicate).",Null,0,1,9 March 2003
Identity," Give Me a Break
","I heard about this movie nearly a year ago and was really excited to see it (since I'm a fan of almost everyone who stars). Plus I respect Cusack's work since he has such an impressive resume.However, this movie really did not hold together for the last 15 or 20 minutes, and I think quite a few people agree with me in saying; WHAT KIND OF ENDING WAS THAT? This is one of those endings where you're like 'huh?' for the next hour after you've left the theater. Trying, desperately, to piece it together. Not one of those clever, profound, thought-provoking endings, but the one where it just didn't make any sense. It came out of left field too quickly and actually pretty unrealistic. Not WHAT happened to the victims, but that it was all apart of some psychotic man's imagination?? Um, okaaaaay.Still, maybe if I didn't expect so much from it, I would have enjoyed it more. I just think it was cheapened and that the screenwriter couldn't come up with anything relevant so he tossed this onto our plates. I found the storyline of 'everything happens for a reason and they were all meant to die at this motel on this night' and all. That's more interesting to me personally.",Null,0,1,11 June 2003
