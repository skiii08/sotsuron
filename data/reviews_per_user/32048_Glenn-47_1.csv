The Blair Witch Project," What a rip off!
",I've been to movies where I thought it was a waste of my time and money being there. But this one takes the cake. This movie was so bad I can't even begin to tell you. I felt like my time and money was stolen from me! The people that came up with this scam (movie) must be laughing all the way to the bank. If you enjoy watching someone run around with a home video cam in there face screaming this movie is for you! Don't forget your headache medicine though.,1,2,3,19 November 1999
