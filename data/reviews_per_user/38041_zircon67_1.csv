Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Totally Awesome with a few flaws
","TPM does not disappoint. It's totally awesome - the acting was fine, the plot was good and the script was okay. The visual effects were amazing and the light saber duels were the best ever in Star Wars. I didn't find Jar Jar Binks irritating at all too.However, I did find the speaking accents of the various aliens quite irritating. And I thought it was way too easy for Anakin to accidentally blow up the whole ship which disabled the droids.On the whole, this movie rocks and I'll definitely watch it a few more times in the cinema.",8,0,0,28 May 1999
