United 93," What was good about this movie?
","What in god's name was good about this movie, i am unable to understand.. The panic isn't there, nor can you see any acting, nor is the tension or emotion rising.. Just because the movie is made on a sensitive topic doesn't make it good in itself..I SWEAR I HAVE NEVER EVER SLEPT IN A MOVIE BEFORE, BUT THIS ONE JUST LULLS YOU TO SLEEP!!! hope you get it.. man..I saw the rating in here and was all excited about this movie.. but you don't get a thing of what's going on in there.. half the time the actors aren't audible, there's no shouting in even such a tense situation, everyone on the plane is talking on phones.. what exactly is going on man?? I know a good movie from a bad 'cause i've seen enough.. but this ain't it man.. this ain't it..",1,22,55,14 October 2006
Wanted," Not Extraordinary but FUN!!!!
","Well I went with no expectations at all but I was pleasantly surprised.The movie is no 'Iron Man' or 'Dark Knight' but its a real fun watch with some cool graphics.Although Jolie and Freeman are both wasted, this is a fun watch if you got nothing to do for two hours and just wanna watch a light flick.The second half is a bit dull and ending predictable, but well, worse movies have been made in Hollywood. I don't care what anybody else thinks, I had fun.Watch it on a rainy day or when you just wanna take your mind off this world. Just don't use your head too much!:)All in all, 6/10.",6,0,3,1 September 2008
