Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Different from the Original Trilogy, but just as good
","Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace is a different movie than its predecessors. The new technology and the long wait (16 years) since the last movie has given TPM a new feel and texture, yet retains some of the same qualities as the original movies. The Phantom Menace is often a bit too fast-paced and childish, but it overcomes these minor problems with it's visually appealing wonders and the questions it raises, such as the reasons behind Anakin's descent into the Dark Side. Decide for yourself, but I found The Phantom Menace to be far better than what the critics had to say about it. This is a quality motion picture.",7,0,1,19 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Far superior to Phantom Menace
","Attack of the Clones is an excellent movie, and is far superior to Phantom Menace (which is still a good movie). It is more fun than Episode 1, has a faster pace, has a more interesting plot, and less Jar-Jar. This is a visually stunning film (it didn't hurt to see it in a digital theater). The action scenes are fantastic, and it was nice to see Mace Windu and Yoda receive more screen time; the audience cheered every time they were onscreen at the end of the movie. Hints of dark things to come kept popping up throughout the film, which added to the fun. The film has its flaws. It is a little slower at the beginning of the movie, and the dialogue IS a bit flat or corny at times, but that is something one hears in all of the Star Wars movies. I will have to watch the film again, but after the initial viewing I feel that this film ranks up there with the original trilogy, and I can't wait to see it again.",7,0,0,16 May 2002
