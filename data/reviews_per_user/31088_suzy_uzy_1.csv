The New World," Worse than Children of the Corn!!!!
","DAAAAAAAAMN was I ever bored!!!! Worse movie of all times.....worse than Children of the Corn movie! Hello..it is not a documentary movie about nature! and We r not deaf! Plus, barely any events in the movie and way too freaking slow..half an hour looking at each other and another 2 hours to say one word! 2 thumbs down for this movie.....Awful just awful....could u imagine that its worse than children of the corn ....way worse! and what the hell happened to Farrell when he left...hello where did he go? what shore was he on? why the hell did he even leave her? that guy was able to marry her! Farrell does not fit those kinda movies....James Franco shouldve been in this movie but noway James Franco is way better to be in this movie!",1,1,8,31 January 2006
