First Man," An emotional film
","The film is shot in hand held camera it looks like, mostly from the perspective of Neil himself, which is refreshing for a topic like this. Even most of the space flight events are shot from his view (the only time it uses long external views are Saturn V launch which, is visually impressive, just, so awesome). This really puts me in Neil's seat and feel his emotion. Most of the movie focus on Neil's emotion through his interaction with family and colleagues which I found very interesting.",9,2,10,13 October 2018
