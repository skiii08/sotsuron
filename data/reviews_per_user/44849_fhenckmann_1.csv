The Ring," biggest crap imaginable
","I saw this movie yesterday night at a sneak preview and found it terrible. So of course I wanted to look at the movie's ratings at imdb.com and was quite surprised by its high ratings. So maybe the reason for my dismay is that I actually did not want to watch a horror / psycho flic, but even if I would have wanted to this movie would have certainly disappointed me. There is no logic behind the movie whatsoever. All it does is steal some ideas of other movies (all genres) and meet every clich√© there is in the horror genre. And instead of ending at an acceptable 80 minutes, it drags on and on. SPOILER: Having almost reached the end, you think 'okay, at least it has a decent ending with the bad dreams of that spooky girl in the well finally gone' and then it -like so many other horror flics- still continues and gives us an open end, ready to make a sequel if necessary. All I can say is: please don't! I am not an avid fan of the horror genre, but still I think that I can say this one is really really bad. I'd give it 2 out of ten points, and that's because the main actress is kinda good looking.",3,1,2,22 January 2003
