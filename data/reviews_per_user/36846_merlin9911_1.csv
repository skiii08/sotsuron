Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abe Lincoln..Ninja
","One LOSER movie. I'm no virgin, I have seen lots of book adaptations go bad, but most of them are at least bearable. This is one of only about 3 movies that I have ever walked out on in my 50 years of viewing movies. Part of the fun of the book is how close it came to reality...how far the author went to make it at least plausible, mixing fact and fantasy. I suffered through the first part of the movie and finally had to throw in the towel. What scene got me? The teenage mutant ninja President scene with the ax. Really? Why? There was just no possible good reason for that ninja trash. He was a rail splitter, strong and accurate with an ax. Want to throw the ax...well OK maybe, but that was plain silly. So, take heed..just say no to this one.",1,16,33,24 September 2012
