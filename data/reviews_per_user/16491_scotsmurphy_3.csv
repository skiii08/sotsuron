Come and See," I haven't seen a movie like this before or since
","Well well wellMy dad bought this movie and after reading the back i was intrigued to say the least . When finally getting the opportunity to sit and watch it, I was pretty much left reeling for the whole movie ,it is a war movie like no other ,it looks real, it feels real and is harrowing to the point that it will scare you, I could recount many scenes, that for me were just so strange, abstract and not least powerful.I was so impressed by this piece of cinema that I had to show my brother, who really could not believe his eyes and ears, it is a masterpiece which towers over anything and everything that has came out of Hollywood, incidentally I was curious as to what my girlfriend would think of it, and with her being an American and more akin to movies like 'P.S I love you' was curious to her reaction.Unsurprisingly we got 25 minuets into the movie, after viewing the harrowing shocking scene of the dead villagers stacked up like dead cattle at the side of the house ,with the camera panning back as the two kids/partisans flee is just shocking to the core, and then to top it off, it is followed by one of the most uncomfortable and disturbing scene that i have viewed in a long time of the boy and the girl making there way through the quagmire .Needless to say it was not of her liking i found her with tears of discomfort in her eyes and I was hastily told to turn it off, but for a movie to have that power and effect on its viewer is something very very rare nowadays ,it startled and shocked me to the core, others it brought tears of discomfort .If you like cinema if you like provocative art and you can handle an emotional ride that is not comforting and with no George Clooney smile to make you feel warm n fuzzy inside, then get this movie, turn off the lights, put the volume up and get ready for a piece of cinema that is truly unique.",10,5,6,2 November 2009
This Is the End," Down right Idiotic, hilarious, stoner movie.
","This is the End A film brought to you by Seth Rogen James Franco and the pineapple express guys.This is an interesting movie, without knowing anything about it I viewed it late one Saturday night, in the perfect frame of mind so to speak, completely by chance.But let me tell you, it was one of the most enjoyable ,idiotic, hilarious comedy horror movies i have watched since Pineapple Express, probably.Now I should be quick to warn! this movie is not for everyone, some say it is crude, and its references to weed and drugs are blatant, but alas thats why I like it!, its a trashy, goofy, stupid stoner movie, with some of the funniest, geekiest immature dialogue since Pinapple Expess hit the screen.Now there is a story line to go with all the drugs and debauchery, and of course its the End of Time, the Apocalypse ladies and gentlemen, all mankind is being judged!, and we get to spend it at James Franco's house with his stoned out, dumb as f%&k actor friends.Now this movie is not a family movie, its made by guys, for guys, and the best way to watch this movie is with red eyes, it has a target audience, who it will resonate with, and i am absolutely certain this will become a cult classic, it has all the ingredient's needed.To sum up my feeling toward this movie, I was genuinely surprised by it, it felt different, and it took me a while to decide if the whole parody of themselves was going to be detrimental to the movie. It was not, if anything it enhanced it.Now highbrow intellectual stuff this is not, god help the poor sod who comes into this movie thinking he will be intellectually challenged.If i had to compare to this to another movie I would say Simon Peggs Shaun of the Dead, with who it shares many similarities, the apocalypse setting, the over the top comedy, the 'bromance', and often campy dialogue are a few of the things in common.The bottom line is this. IT is a stoner movie, and is best viewed accordingly to get the full enjoyment. Now this is not a prerequisite, it has good actors with a decent story line and you will get a laugh.7/10",7,2,6,23 March 2014
The Hangover Part II," It's happened again
","The Hangover 2 The hangover part two see's the 'wolf pack' , Phil, Stu, Doug, and Alan head to Thailand for Stu's wedding, and with Stu finally finding true love and dealing with a less than impressed father in law he is determined to be on his best behaviour .However after reluctantly inviting Alan to the wedding ,and Phil's determination to get a bachelor party, the quiet bonfire on the beach soon turns out to be the catalyst for a wild night in Bangkok.Let me take the time to mention a crucial character in the proceedings who drives the whole story ,Teddy ,Teddy is Stu's brides little brother he is sixteen years old and a child prodigy 'the hands of a brilliant musician and one day surgeon ' his Father announces after Teddy's Chelo performance ,not surprising then that Teddy should go on to lose one of his fingers while out with the Wolf Pack .The second Hangover also gets it spot on reintroducing Mr Chow from the first movie, his persona fitting well with a sleazy drug fuelled night in Bangkok and he gets some of the biggest laughs of the movie.Now for a quick word about the actors ,all the main protagonists Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis ,Justin Bartha, have settled into there characters well and are likable believable and just fun to watch ,the supporting cast again was excellent and really makes the movie seem full of life .Yes Hangover Two was a cutout of the first movie ,but that is no bad thing, the movie looked great,the locations looked great , the soundtrack was excellent, its laugh out loud funny ,i will however say that if you like your comedy more refined its probably not for you.We have all had those mornings of waking up to 'what the hell happened last night! where the hell am i' probably not to the extent of The Hangover ,but that is where the movie is rooted ,its about some blokes who partied a little too hard and had to pay the consequences the next day.So long gay boys.",7,1,2,14 October 2012
