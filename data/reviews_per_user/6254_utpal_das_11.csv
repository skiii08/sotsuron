Sucker Punch," Don't expect too much OR I probably didn't get it
","I did because it came not from the director of 300, but from the director who gave us Watchmen. 300 was a visual delight and something radically new for its time. Watchmen was a different genre altogether, one of those rare movies which cannot be probably clubbed in any genre.I went out thinking if Watchmen was something like 10 steps ahead of 300, then Sucker Punch would be really a new dimension. That thinking cost me. Yes, the visuals were spectacular, but all of them were in dream sequence,having no relativity to the original story. Yes, you can have artistic liberty, but then it should be like 'Inception' where every scene, every detail is tagged to the story.There was no twist, no suspense, nothing really 'unfolds'. The story is as predictable as it can be. Not much of a story anyway, just a abused girl trying to make her way out of a mental asylum where she has been put by her step father. Yes, thats it. And probably about 30 minutes of the entire movie is towards that. Rest of it, you could very well deduct and the 'movie' would still be there. Of course the only things missing would be what you would go for at the first place - the visuals.Amazing visuals, mind blowing, it takes you out of the world at times, almost like a 6 or 7/ 10 compared to Avatar, but this is 2D. So really really spectacular. Cannot imagine any movie in 2D showing visuals this brilliant. There is a message in the movie which was either too simple, (that is, it is you who write your own destiny) or I probably didn't get it. I mean the reason I liked Watchmen was for its message that sometimes it takes a lie to make amends, peace based on a lie because of the greater good. And when you get the message, you recall the film backward and if there were any questions you had, you get the answers and that gives you your money worth. That part was as I said either missing or I didn't get it.Try ignoring the story and the screen play and you will enjoy it more. There was not a lot for acting scale and all the actors played to the roles.Overall, go with an open mind without any perception or prejudice and you will enjoy the sheer glamour the movie has. Its brutally fantastic. I gave it a 5 for the visual delights, its just that when you go for a movie, you want it to your heart's content. It didn't satisfy me at all and thereby I could at most give it a 5.",2,5,12,28 March 2011
The Hateful Eight," MASTERPIECE. Period
","Why I am giving it a 9? Cause I think Quentin could have done better. How? I don't know, only he might know.But I think he can.Is it better than Pulp Fiction? No, it Pulp Fiction better? Maybe yes, just because he was young ands less experienced, thats about it.Now, the movie... Its more than 150 minutes, the first hour is very intriguing, the next half hour gets a little slow and maybe could have been a tad shorter.But then the last hour is like a full throttle hormone rising epic like you have never seen before. I am 43 and having seen all the movies, from Kurusowa to Cameron to Nolan to Guy Ritchie to Hitchcock, not that my saying matters, but this movie sits Quentin at the very top 3. Every character is brilliantly crafted, so beautiful, every scene in the movie is epic. I don't understand the 70mm concept of this movie being the last of it, but the camera work and the angles were just perfect.Rusell, Leigh, Jackson and Goggins were just too good. You also have Quentin's steady arsenal in Madsen and Zoe Bell, cameos from both.The story... set up in the 19th century, 3 men are taking a outlaw and they rest in a deserted cafe in the midst of a blizzard and there is something happening, you can only sense, but you wont get anything more. And that is the brilliance of Quentin, he unfolds the story in an amazing way, not even giving you any hints, but you know something is just not right abd then...BOOM! 1 gun shot and then the epic happens, that is the last hour and the first 1 and half hour is just the dosage to build that final BOOM.If you love movies, if you love art (but mind you, its very very gory, typical Quentin) if you love story telling, if you love screenplay, if you love acting, if you love anything to do with movies, you will love this film.I am not from America, so if there is apolitical undertone as a reviewer has mentioned, I didn't get it, but undertone or not, this movie is a treat.And the music,,, oh the music, the background score and all which is always a big factor of Quentin's movie, probably the best of all. And just to repeat, what an awesome camera work.Quentin delivers again, even out does himself, I don't know how, but he does",9,68,154,20 December 2015
Interstellar," Not expected from Nolan
","The 5 stars are mainly for the CGI effects and one scene where Anne Hathaway talks about love.Maybe the film is okay, if not good, but coming from someone like Nolan, who is probably the greatest director at least in this century, you surely expect to your heart's content.After the Batman trilogy and Inception which satiates you to the brim and more, this is just not it. I liked Gravity and if this came from the same director, I would have ranked it higher than gravity, but from Nolan? If you are a film freak like me, I would still stay to go out to the theater, it is different and a nice movie, but not of Nolan's class. Period.",5,3,6,15 November 2014
Oblivion," Just like Tron Legacy, all gloss, no show
","There are a few actors whose movies most people definitely like to watch, the so called box office stars. Tom Cruise is one of them, I like to watch which ever movie he stars and I liked his last 2 ventures, Day & Knight and Jack Reacher, his movies entertain. This didn't. All the movie has was gloss and lots of it, it was a visual spectacle and thats about it. The screenplay was bad, story/ plot is confusing, the actors are very very wooden, even the ever reliable Morgan Freeman was wooden. Cruise was alright. Overall story is that the main actors along with some very powerful drones take care of what remains of earth after a huge battle with 'Scavengers' or that is what the main actors think until the truth is revealed. A lot of the movie depends on the director as we all know and I guess a director has a bigger influence than the star. Christopher Nolan can probably make a star out of anybody. Here, the director was more in charge. The guy had previously made the hi quality 3D movie 'Tron Legacy'. I say high quality because the animation was mind blowing, but the movie was as bad as it can get. Oblivion was not as bad as Tron, but if Cruise was not there, even the mind blowing visuals couldn't have saved the film, not that Cruise can. IMAX effect is good. If there are no other movies in the theater and you just landed there, you might watch it, but don't make an effort to go out there just for the movie. The last 2 consecutive big budget movies turned out as damp squibs (G.I Joe and this) and hope Ironman 3 is better although the trailer doesn't look that promising",2,2,8,12 April 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Don't watch it if you haven't seen LOTR or Hobbit 1
","To be honest, I have not watched any of the LOTR movies or the first part of Hobbit nor have read J R Toklen, he must be good as all the LOTRs are box office success. But for people like me, who just wanted to be entertained, this is certainly not the movie. There was so much hype, so thought, why not try. I, of course, couldn't make sense of it, and fell asleep after 30 mins or so, woke up don't know when, a man was ferrying midgets in a boat hidden in tubs of fish. I decided to walk out. So for people who haven't seen any of the movies previously, don't watch it. Enjoy the Disney movie, Frozen, not the best from Disney by a long shot, still watchable.",1,10,17,20 December 2013
Prisoners," Glaring loop holes, still brilliant taut thriller
","Yes, there are loop holes, enormous to swallow a whale, but look at this the other way, call it cinematic liberty and enjoy this brilliant movie. Some of the loop holes gets filled up when you retrospectively look at the film, yet... there are some glaring ones.... BUT... probably they were necessary to make this such a good film. Everyone cant be Alfred Hitchcock, but Denis Villeneuve is pretty darn good. You have seen the trailers, 2 kids get abducted and Hugh Jackman suspects a mentally challenged guy to be behind it. You just cannot avoid suspicion that every major character can be a suspect, the director instigates the viewer to think for every character that s/he may be the prime suspect, but you wont be able to guess and you play into the suspense. Even the small sub stories/ plots add to the final story. The story is not the main highlight, its the acting and the screenplay/ script Everyone plays their role to perfection. Hugh Jackman & Jack Gyllenhal probably plays their best role till date. Its a 2 and half hour movie, you just wish it was a little more longer. A really nice taut thriller.",8,2,6,20 September 2013
Jack Reacher," Pure Solid Entertainment
","Everything you want from a 'Tom Cruise' movie.... Solid Entertainment throughout. Not even 1 single special effects, it is pure storytelling, a thriller as a 'Thriller' should be. There is acting, little comedy, solid action, car chases, just like those brilliant 80s action movies. There is suspense, drama... what more do you need. Just go out there and you will enjoy. I am giving it a 9 because of some dialog's and a scene or two that was purely theatrical and was not supposed to be there. Beside that, there WAS NO SINGLE SCENE that was IRRELEVANT. Nice story, brilliant screenplay, sure your money's worth if you like pure cinema, watchable with your entire family.",9,8,17,24 December 2012
Inception," This is a'Maze'ing movie
","The moving is a'Maze'ing and you will come out of the maze (read cinema) in just a tad less than 2 and half hours, fully refreshed and satisfied. Watched the first show of the day at 12 noon (India Time) which I guess means it is yet to be released in US while I am writing the review.Another DiCaprio thriller after Shutter Island and that too in the same year. DiCaprio has done just 11 movies since Titanic came out in 1997 and probably you can name them all, he is that selective). Too good to be true. Actually it is too good as although you cant and shouldn't compare, Christopher Nolan has matched Martin Scorsese and has probably outdone himself compared to TDK. Forget the complexity about the plot of a dream within a dream within a dream, what will linger are the amazing visuals caught in slo-mo. Everything seems to fall in place like a Swiss watch that by the end of the movie all your questions and 'how did that' gets answered.There is a lot of similarity between Inception and Shutter Island and the similarity is that they are like North and South Poles. That different yet nonetheless they are poles, right.I do not want to give the story one bit because that is the beauty of this movie's concept, the story unfolds with almost every scene and there is always the suspense that the story just might take a dramatic turn in each frame and does it take the turn or turns? Well, go watch for yourself and you will feel like writing a review yourself.All the actors are good and plays to the character, but the thing is the movie is so damn brilliant, I guess Nolan could have just about cast anybody and it would still have turned out a'Maze'ing.",9,6,11,16 July 2010
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Sorry forgot to write the plot
","Batman was okay, Superman was okay, Lex Luthor trying to be psychotic was looking mental (Jesse is not such a bad actor, but...) Wonder Woman/ Gal Gadot was there, why she was there? Ummm.... coming up from Zack is Justice League, so... here she was just there... barelyThe story tries hard to materialize in the first half and then finally when Batman faces Superman as the title suggests, it turns out Batman and Superman, no more versus and what killed it all was the dialogue from Lex Luthor ' You either kill Batman or I will kill your mother'What in the world was that? C'Mon this is so not 1970, and why, for God sake why kill Batman by Luthor? No reason absolutely.So, sorry, Zack forgot to write the plot.Giving it 6 for visuals and taking down 2 for the villain, oh come on, dialogues like 'Its unkillable' killed the average movie",4,2,8,26 March 2016
Cloud Atlas," Viewers know better than IMDb rating- Worst movie of the decade
","So much hype! Well IMDb ratings has it over 8 while it totally bombed in the box office.Reviewers say that the photography is excellent, well, why waste your money, since you can see better photography in Nat Geo HD. All those giving high ratings are probably the pseudo cinema goers. The makers had made the Matrix series, somehow they were more inspired by the 2nd and 3rd part of Matrix than the original. Complex story (like Inception or Shutter Island) is one thing, but trying to make it just so that it seems complex is actually a foolish thing. Every story told even how complex it is should hold the audience in the seat, I took 2 breaks of 30 mins each, that much appealing was the screenplay. And the movie is for 2 and a half hour. You can walk out and walk in anytime and you would still be there. Several stories and all of them had Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, why? Ummm probably saving money or maybe just trying to put up a pseudo complex story. I would probably watch those kiddish vampire movie series compared to a movie which had Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, it is that bad. Even Sucker Punch or Tron Legacy would probably deserve half a more star than this.",1,27,55,9 December 2012
Spectre," A better movie than Skyfall
","I am writing this just so that I can increase the rating as it certainly deserves a better than 7.1Coming back...Skyfall was NOT a Bond movie, simply because one associates a Bond movie with gizmos, cheap thrill, amazing babes and one liners. Skyfall had an excellent storyline and screenplay but it could have been any thriller movieSo Sam Mendes at the helm again, my expectations were low (P.S I am a huge Mendes fan, but I just didn't associate the 'Bond' factor with Skyfall). Plus with negative reviews everywhere, I went to the cinema just because I had to keep my record of watching every Bond movie since 2000 in the cinema.I was very pleasantly surprised (albeit because I had low expectations) of watching a beautiful story. Yes, no gizmos again, no glam babes, but the thrill came out from the opening scene of the helicopter to the car chases.The only negative if I can say, was that the villains role (both Waltz and Bautista) were not strong enough, I mean who better than Waltz but his trademark strength of dialogue delivery didn't have much scope and Bautista just came and went, no prelude, no exit, nothing. This is Waltzwe are talking about, no less. The menacing villains from Casino Royale and Skyfall were memorable. Then the Bond woman, the ever gorgeous Bellucci was reduced to a 5 minute role. I am 43, so guys of my age can relate to the disappointmentBrilliant screenplay and it has the traditional Mendes drama strengthSo, again not a very 'Bond'movie, but I enjoyed it (to repeat myself) owing to the low expectations. But now I look forward to the next installment Bond 25 as i know what to expect.",9,5,11,26 November 2015
