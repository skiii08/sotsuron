The Equalizer," Batman meets Rambo meets Liam Neeson and they are black = The equalizer (MUST WATCH)
","Have you ever though what would Batman, Rambo o Liam Neeson roles would look like if they were all black? Well, this movie answers the question.This is a must-see movie for every action fan who enjoys Liam Neeson crime genres such as Taken. If you would like to see someone seriously kicks ass to the Russian Mafia this is your movie.The scenes has a lots of adrenaline and Denzel Washington acting is great! I would recommend not to watch the trailer before this movie because it will make the twist of the story even more unexpected and enjoyable.",9,1,7,13 October 2014
