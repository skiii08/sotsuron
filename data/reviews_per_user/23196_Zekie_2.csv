The Benchwarmers," Oh so not that funny
","I was hoping to rather laugh a bit more than just a few scenes of the 'Benchwarmers'. None of it was really funny and the constant repetition was actually becoming quite annoying. Waiting and wondering when this movie ends is usually not the most enjoying experience you get when you watch a movie. Since you spent money on a movie, you feel compelled to finish it, just so you get your money worths and this movie was definitely not worth the money nor the time. If you want something funny, don't waste your time on this one, you won't be laughing.",4,6,11,1 August 2006
Saw III," Not at all what I expected
","I absolutely loved Saw and Saw II. They were absolutely great, the games, the plot, the characters, absolutely great, even the acting was quite impressive, which is usually not the case in horror, gory movies.However, Saw III left me not only disappointed, but also disgusted. I have observed my share of open-heart and brain surgeries, considering I am going to med school, I have absolutely no problem seeing guts, blood, any kind of injuries. I see them all the time. Needless to say I have no problem seeing someone being ripped open. I can't say that about Saw III. It made my stomach turn, which I guess, you would say, the movie succeeded in its goal. However, in the past movies, when Jigsaw played his game, he made it possible of a way out. There is no way out.Basically, instead of having a plot, a story, with characters to make the story believable, it's just a movie of a fest of torture. I liked Saw because of the whole 'being ungrateful of your life' and it has not followed the same paths in the sequel. I was in a big surprise and it wasn't a good one.It was my first movie I walked out on within the first hour, not because it was too gory, but because it was not worth the $15 dollars I paid to watch something that has no plot, no believable characters, and is not anywhere near the original. I wouldn't waste my time nor money for this movie, unless you can get it for a dollar at the Box, if you really wondering what it's about, but even that's not even worth it.",2,1,2,2 November 2006
