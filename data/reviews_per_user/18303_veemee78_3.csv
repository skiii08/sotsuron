Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Missed Opportunity
","A Phantom Menace is a victim of poor directing/writing on Lucas's part. Rather than providing an introduction to the Star Wars saga, the film drops you into the middle of a conflict that's not properly unfolded(hence the long intro to the movie), and revolves around a battle that, while a good story on its own, has nothing to do with the Star Wars films we know and love.This is particularly disappointing because what else there is in the movie is really quite good. The whole background of Anakin Skywalker is excellent (the future Darth Vader starting out as a slave boy on a remote planet is brilliance), and his introduction to the Jedi Council is a bittersweet moment seasoned with dramatic irony. There is also the introduction of the Sith, Coruscant, the Senate and, of course, the Jedi, which are mentioned or referred to numerous times in the original trilogy, but never fully revealed.The special effects, while impressive, are only a taste of what will come in the next two prequels: incredible abuse of the CGI technology Lucas has at his fingertips. Nevertheless, the space battles are akin to what we're familiar with, the pod racing is an instant classic, and the lightsaber duels are breathtaking.In spite of the high points of the film, The Phantom Menace is a real disappointment. It's a clunky 'introduction' that is odd compared to the original trilogy no matter how you look at it, littered with cheesy lines, bad costumes, bad directing, things thrown in only for nostalgia's sake (C-3P0 really should not have been in this movie), contradictions to the original films, and of course, Jar-Jar. But Gungans or no Gungans, this film can only be seen as bitter medicine that must be swallowed by Star Wars fans. Fortunately, the prequels get slightly better as they go on, but they still stand best as a separate trilogy, no matter how desperately Lucas tries to tie the two together.",1,32,62,28 June 2005
The Butterfly Effect," Entertaining but inherently flawed
","I must admit that I was intrigued by the premise of this movie: a young student with a tragic life history discovers unexplained powers that enable him to relive the past through memories, and even change history. It makes for some interesting twists, which the movie takes advantage of time and time again.But with a premise as complicated as time travel, there are steps the writer must take to keep the plot holes at a minimum. Unfortunately, the writers of Butterfly Effect are so busy exploring different possibilities for their new 'toy,' that the plot holes are left there in abundance. Even a casual viewer can not help but notice them, and if you're one of those people who discusses things you noticed after watching a movie, you'll find that you like the film much less in retrospect.Plot holes aside, the film has a good pacing and an unmatched blend of tragedy, drama, and horror. Ashton Kutcher delivers an astonishing performance considering his history with comedies. Development of other characters is very uniquely executed, especially since a few characters have very different personalities when the main character alters history.All in all, the Butterfly Effect is an entertaining film, even though its integrity leaves something to be desired.",7,1,3,30 June 2005
Jurassic Park," CGI... the way it should be
","Jurassic Park is most memorable for its groundbreaking special effects. It was not the first film to use computer-generated imaging, not by a long shot, but it was the first to take the bold step of using CGI, not stop-motion, to create life-like animals. It was very successful in this area; the special effects still hold up (mostly) today. However, even with this powerful new toy, the masterminds of this movie were wise not to overdo the special effects. Instead, different scenes of robotics, CGI, and some clever techniques (the vibrating water in the cup, for example) combine to give the illusion that there really were dinosaurs on that island.Plot? A movie this big doesn't need a very deep plot, but the one in Jurassic Park is decent enough to make for an engaging thriller. Using a new cloning technique and some shady business skills, the eccentric John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) plans to open a theme park in a Costa Rican tropical island, with live dinosaurs as the main attraction... a guaranteed cash cow. But there's one flaw in his plan: nothing works the way it should. This becomes shockingly evident when a mishap at one of the pens results in one of his workers being eaten alive. Hoping to assure his worried investors that nothing is 'really' wrong, Hammond persuades several experts into visiting the island to inspect it and come up with their own conclusions. It is during this visit that the worst break-down occurs, and the survivors find that they must get things back online so they can contact the mainland for help.The cast here is impeccable. Sam Neill is perfect as the soft-spoken paleontologist turned action hero, Laura Dern plays her action scenes with authentic desperation, and Jeff Goldblum will make you wonder if he really is reading off memorized lines. Even the kids (Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards) aren't as bad as they could be.This all makes for a great film, both memorable in and of itself, and as a reminder of how well CGI can be used. It doesn't have to be present in every scene (e.g. Star Wars), and it doesn't have to be used to create unrealistic battlefields and unbelievable creatures (e.g. just about every science fiction and action film in the last decade). When used as seasoning to an already good movie, it can make for brilliant film-making.",10,2,3,8 July 2006
