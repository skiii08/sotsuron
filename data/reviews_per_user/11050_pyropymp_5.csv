The Ring," very disappointing
","Okay, maybe it's because I've watched 'Ringu' first before watching this, but this is a complete travesty compared to the sheer horror in the subtlety of the original.*Spoilers ahead*When the girl comes out of the TV in the first one, I was creeped out (note: but not scared) like crazy, and there were many nights where I had trouble sleeping. With the special effects in this one, it was way over done.I guess when it comes down to it, it really depends on which one you watch first... if you see this one first before the original, you might like this one better. 'Thriller/horror' like this is all about first time watching, when you least expect something to happen. I will say this however: part of the problem with this remake compared to the original is that it tries too hard to explain everything (typical for western audience, where everything must be explained and addressed), part of the thing that did it for me in the original one was that it started mysteriously, and ended mysteriously.Anyways, I just didn't like it... I wasn't as creeped out as I wanted to.",Null,0,1,16 April 2003
Hero," breath-taking
","One thing that every viewer of this movie must keep in mind: it helps A GREAT DEAL to know about ancient Chinese History... without these basic knowledge, it is obvious that some people might criticize it from very irrelevant perspectives ranging from plot, script, etc etc. To explain it in a way that people (foreigners/westerners) can understand and appreciate would be an extremely difficult task... you must have the background to fully appreciate this movie for what it is.I loved this film, it is intellectually, emotionally, and VISUALLY inspiring. A true work of film art, and most definitely NOT a martial arts flick. I guess if you really want to criticize it in the most basic sense, yes, the character development is lacking, and it is less personal and intimate as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but that's because we've all watched the REDUCED LENGTH VERSION (90 mins), I wonder which smartas$ at Hollywood (Miramax I heard?) is responsible for cutting out the 'slower parts' of this masterpiece - whatever high-quality crack he was smoking - it is disgraceful - an utter disgrace. You can show 3 hours of blood-drenched Gangs of New York, why not show this in full length? This version is way too short, and the highest score I'd give it 7/10, but once I watched the full length version, this may very well change.Hollywood, like America in general, really needs to venture out more, and get to know and understand the world outside its own continent.",Null,0,0,15 April 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Very disappointed
","I guess my expectation for this movie was too high, but I was really disappointed. This was essentially a CGI fest, not even the martial arts were worthy of 'dropping jaws' - compared to any decent hong-kong kung-fu flicks, Neo moves like a geriatric, as well as everyone else who fought. The script is poorly written, the dialogues were wooden, long, boring and confusing, and most of all, the action was terrible. There is NO chemistry between Neo and Trinity. The philosophical messages in this one is not bad, but was nothing like the clarity and insight like what the first movie was... whereas in this one I found myself going blablabla at many scenes. The only good part about this movie is the highway chase... boy that was pretty damn amazing.  Oh, did anyone notice the political pun? Where Neo was talking to the architect in the room with walls of screens. When the architect was talking about human corruption, we get a fleeting glimpse of ole' Dubya Bush on the screen. Hahaha, I thought that was great!",1,0,0,15 May 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," beautiful
","Shawshank Redemption is a compelling, moving, and beautiful story which is darkly funny at times. This movie's #2 spot on IMDB is debatable, since it is essentially a formulaic Hollywood story with Hollywood characters... i.e. evil institution (guards) and noble rebels ('some' prisoners) within a microcosm (prison). Andy Dufresne is so incredibly friggin' smart (for a banker) that is almost super-hero like. Though this is definitely a worthy film, in terms of sheer greatness, Shawshank missed Cool Hand Luke by *this much*... If you want a really top-of-the-line awesome prison movie, Cool Hand Luke is the one to see.",9,0,0,29 December 2002
Donnie Darko," The most amazing, unique, and creative film I have seen since Being John Malkovich
","This is a very beautifully made film that is both visually and intellectually stimulating where the story is as compelling as the characters. To me this film is a work of art, and a true work of art appeals and revolts the viewers equally. Those people who found this movie dull or boring have every right to do so - it just didn't yank the right strings for you, I guess. But it is totally unfair for you to judge the people who liked it as dumb, juvenile, and tasteless. The same thing goes for those of us who call you too stupid to understand the movie.One thing everyone must realize - this movie is a total success, not because of whether it appeals to a certain audience, but because of the controversy and debate it stirred. Look at the 500 or so comments and all the discussion going on with this movie... I honestly have never seen such an overwhelming response for any other movie here on IMDB. Like it or not, this movie is a cult classic, and will be remembered for a very long time. No one in his/her right mind should call newcomer Richard Kelly a bad director - the worst thing that can happen to a bad director is that he/she does not get noticed, and Richard Kelly is the total contrary. Do not let your personal opinion blur this downright fact.***SPOILERS*** Now this movie does have its shortcomings, I agree... the part that bugged me the most about this movie is that crack-sniffing bully and his friend. Now this is supposed to be an ultra-conservative highschool where teachers are banned for teaching controversial material (Drew barrymore's character) and kids are suspended for swearing and calling teachers bad names in public (Donnie Darko himself), and these two punks just roam around the school with knifes and cocaine. The fact that they last in that school for anything over a half-a-day is completely beyond me. Other than that, the rest of the movie captured me like a kid in a candy store.I can't say I understood the movie completely, but this is the beauty of Donnie Darko. In my book, any movie that does all the thinking for you is a waste of time. (i.e. Die Another Day and many others)9/10",10,0,1,28 December 2002
