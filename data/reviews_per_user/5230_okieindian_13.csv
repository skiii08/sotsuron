The Longest Yard," The Longest Yard 2005 is poor remake of the Original
","Like so many of today's remakes of GREAT movies, The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler has substituted bad dialogue,less believable actors and left out key scenes that made the original a classic. I have watched the original Longest Yard dozens of times and it is always entertaining without the vulgarity of this remake. The scene with Cloris Leachman and Sandler was a sad departure from the original with Bernadette Peters and Burt Reynolds. Sad because it wasn't funny, was unrealistic and basically was a bad parody of some Mel Brooks comedy that has long been forgotten. Watching the movie, my thoughts turned to the inability of today's movie makers to create something NEW and makes me wonder why so many are so intent on turning something good into garbage. If 'Oklahoma' comes back to Broadway with an all different cast, would anyone be dumb enough to trash the dialogue, the songs and the scenes?? I doubt it! Then why must the boys making movies try to ruin a good movie...Eddie Murphy has done a terrific job of trashing great movies and now Sandler is following in his footsteps... I would rather watch dust settle on the furniture than watch even a small part of the Longest Yard remake again.",1,2,3,29 September 2005
Inglourious Basterds," Inglourious Basterds waste of time film and my money
","Too many morons will believe this is a factual film and those idiots will pass it on as such. It is an insult to the veterans of WWII, and an insult to the intelligence of film goers. The trailer for the film is a piece of misleading garbage that has little to do with the film, and the group portrayed in the trailer should have been called 'The Inglourious Idiots'. Added to all the above is the fact that too many Hollywood drug addicts think that having most of the film in a foreign language makes it a better film. That just proves that much of the Hollywood crowd is a bunch of snobbish, self-important, elitist, and truly uncreative a**es that do not know how to make a good film. I have never been more disappointed in a film. The high point of the movie is Brad Pitt (Angelina Jolie's live-in). His pitiful imitation of the Billy Bob Thornton (One of Angelina's many former squeezes)character in 'Slingblade' was hilarious. The attempt to copy Billy Bob is soooooo bad that Pitt should be at the top of the list for that 'Rotten Tomato' award.. Sheesh, when will film makers try to actually make a good film again. Of the last 100 I've watched, there have been two I'd like to see again. This one is 101 on the list...",1,105,190,20 December 2009
Two for the Money," A platform for the the *F* word - not much more
","Al Pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity. In other words when he could act, he didn't have to talk like some street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he became a promoter of the 'F' word also. This might be the kind of society that they actually live in, but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company. I don't recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity, but it was something like this. 'It shows a lack of intelligence, poor language skills and disrespect for all those that have to listen.' Maybe it is time that Al takes some acting courses again to sharpen his talent. Oh yes, the movie... Probably the worse thing that McConaughey has played in. Hopefully his next role will be in the company of more talented people. Rene Russo as always was hot.",4,0,2,23 January 2006
Alexander," A Spoiler? Who knows? Dumb movie, dumber director...
","Alexander 'Director's Cut' is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever forced myself to watch. Oliver Stone is living proof that there is a very fine line between genius and madness. He has crossed that line and proves once again that he is no Cecil B. DeMille. His lack of focus is evident throughout. His inability to provide any semblance of continuity is the lowest form of trickery, in an attempt to disguise his shortcomings as a professional. More disgusting is how he abuses history in all his 'works' to present his prejudices, his sexual orientations, his perversions and total disregard for the truth. Despite the over abundance of muddled camera angles, action scenes that do not allow one to distinguish who is 'gutting' whom, extensive use of computer graphics,etc, the director was unable to put together anything more than non-sensual sequences with flashbacks that distracted from rather weird dialogue and unrealistic interactions between the characters. I must admit that his casting director did a fine job of casting Jolie as a weirdo, Farrell as a less than a ladies man and Kilmer as a one eyed jerk. (Who did the makeup on Kilmer? The makeup was better in the original 'Hunchback of Notre Dame' which was made in the 40's (or earlier)... Alexander 'Directors Cut' was so bad that I've made myself a promise.. If Oliver Stone's name appears anywhere near a movie I think I want to see, I will fore go that opportunity. No doubt the movie will make millions as people seem to have forgotten what a good movie is suppose to be. Hollywood is no longer in the hands of artists.",1,17,27,15 August 2005
The Hateful Eight," A Waste of Time, Talent and Money
","This is a piece of garbage, created by a mental midget, which is typical of the garbage that the weirdies in Hollywood find so appealing.. It is racist, discriminatory, lame, drawn out and filled with the 'manure' that the Hollywood lamebrains find so endearing.... Having read the reviews of some others, I can only say that they must have been paid to write the reviews, or they were a part of the production of this waste of time... The only good part of the movie was the violence.... If all cast members had been killed in the first 5 minutes, the next 3 hours could have been better spent watching their bodies decompose..",1,31,58,5 April 2016
Tropic Thunder," Most Dumb Movie of the Year Award
","Considering the talents of Stiller, Black and Downey, I thought maybe this would be a movie I'd enjoy. Instead it starts off with the lowest form of early Eddie Murphy type vulgarity and proceeds downhill from there. Too many people seem to think that the use of vulgar, offensive and totally unnecessary words and phrases, is humorous, simply because they themselves get off on being morons. Downey plays the role of a black soldier to perfection, but unfortunately he plays it at the lowest level of morality, and almost reduces himself to the level of the other two scumbags, who apparently think they are above the laws of common decency. The people who allowed this movie to be made should be made aware that not all movie goers are lowlife morons of questionable character who find gutter humor attractive. This piece of trash is an insult to the paying customer! It doesn't' matter what the Stiller, Black and Downey PR people write as 'reviews' of this movie, it is a piece of garbage from people who have no respect for themselves or for those who paid to see the movie, expecting entertainment, not another piece of nauseating garbage. Disgusting Award is hereby presented to...",1,2,7,21 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," More than likely contains a spoiler and the film deserves it
","I did not read the book and after seeing the movie I never will. I did unfortunately watch the movie and found it to be a typical Hollywood waste of film, talent, money and my time. The hopelessness of Hollywood has nothing to do with real life. If the jerks spent as much time not glorifying the punk, violent, foul mouth, slim ball characters that the 'suits' in that town seem to admire so much, and made more effort to show life among normal people (Normal in respect to the whores, gangs, etc, etc.)things might be a little brighter... I should have known better than to watch any movie nominated for a Hollywood award... I don't think the idiots there have picked one since Rooster Cogburn that was worth a ****. I don't know about others, but I'm tired of being ripped off with shoddy productions that show a complete lack of imagination, talent, or honesty.",1,35,56,18 March 2008
2012," too much of a good thing
","The movie is based on the old old old prediction that California is going to fall into the ocean (not much of a loss if that happens!) but expands to the WORLD. I love special effects in movies, but there is also too much of a good thing. If half the special effects were edited out, reducing the movie by an hour, or more less, (from 158 minutes down to say 90 minutes) the movie might not turn into a marathon of boredom. It just goes on and on and on... and on and on and on and on.. I don't mind wasting my time watching a bad movie, if it is acknowledged as a bad movie, but some folks in Hollywood must think this is a good movie, or it is just another grab the money and run production that seems to the norm.. So many good actors in such a bad movie... it is a shame!",3,0,2,4 March 2010
Children of Men," dumbed down version of the extinction of the human race
","The best part of this movie is shown in the previews. Without that part there is nothing else. In 2027 no one can get pregnant, or has been pregnant in 18 years. A disillusioned jerk is recruited by a former lover to escort that world's first pregnant woman to a safe haven.. which is on a ship whose purpose is never explained. The black pregnant woman doesn't know who the father of the baby is. All the good characters get killed. The bad guys find the jerk and the pregnant woman under impossible conditions but the Army attacks before they can kill the jerk and some people that had been found under impossible condition, that wanted to help them. The jerk rescues the woman and the baby she has had by now and escapes because the war stops as the soldiers all stand in awe as a crying baby is carried through their midst... The jerk then leads the way to a rendezvous for a row boat to take the woman and baby to the ship, but of course the jerk dies after rowing her out into the ocean and just as he dies the ship arrives and .............. (that's it? Fade to black? Just totally stupid.....",1,5,11,20 April 2007
Paranormal Activity," Cheap knockoff off a great movie....
","A spoiler is a comment that 'spoils' the end of a movie? Well, I guess that when there is a cheap, boring, idiotic movie made for pennies, then someone needs to be honest about it and SPOIL it. I find it hard to believe that anyone is gullible enough to believe this garbage anyhow, but even worse is those who think it is ORIGINAL. It is nothing more than a poor remake of a great movie (The Entity - 1981) with Barbara Hershey, that actually showed some creativity, had a believable script and was more than a 'one thought' endeavor. That there are enough people willing to waste their money to sit through a movie like this will never cease to amaze me. The only good part of the movie was when the broad was dragged down the hall screaming.. the bad part about that is that she came back on camera to finish the movie. Movie goers beware... you have been duped.... AGAIN..",2,2,3,31 December 2009
The Departed," I hope this qualifies as a spoiler as the movie stinks
","That movies such as this are put up for awards is amazing to me. There was some fine acting, but the plot must have been left on the cutting room floor. It was another of those boring attempts by some pseudo-intellects to present who knows what. My sister in law watched half the movie, went out to get a coke, walked back into the wrong theater and sat there 30 minutes before she knew it was not the same movie. It IS that disjointed. She liked the other movie better. I did not see that one and I'm sure I liked it better also. I was bitterly disappointed that such a highly praised movie turned out to be such a PRIZE WINNING dud...",1,2,6,5 March 2007
Wedding Crashers," One of the best I've seen lately
","I don't give any movie a 10...but this one is close. The concept is original (or at least I've not seen anything like it). The humor is sharp. The lines are delivered in a crisp believable manner and what happens could really happen in real life. The two guys act like friends and say the things that friends say. The situations too, could exist in real life just as shown. It probably would have been even closer to a 10 without the T&A displays, and if most of the F words were eliminated from the script. I know that some say that is the way that people talk, but I don't hear it in my circles, except from some of the lowlifes I know (*Smile*) and even then not in mixed company.",9,0,0,5 January 2006
Munich," This might contain a spoiler or two?
","I attempted to watch this movie to gain insight into the work of the Israelis after the Munich massacre. The entire movie could have been condensed to 90 minutes without losing anything. Actually it could have been reduced down to 9 minutes without losing anything. Scenes drag by filled with unnecessary 'footage' and dialog. The movie is told from the viewpoint of a 'weak sister' who found that killing was great fun, but then developed a conscience. There is always a whiny-ass in every group. This movie is about a war, unconventional to say the least, but still a war. The participants are merely soldiers in that war. It they turn into gutless wonders after they have been in battle, that does not change the fact that others war fighters do their job and can still function in this world. I can't help but wonder what Spielberg's 'needs' are to show a scene with a man having sex with his pregnant wife, or later practically raping her as he has flashbacks of something that he did not witness? Come on people, how can he have flashbacks of things he was not a party to... I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",Null,0,2,25 June 2006
