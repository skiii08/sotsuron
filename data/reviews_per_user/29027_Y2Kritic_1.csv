The Ring," 'The Ring' entertaining, but unoriginal
","Naomi Watts is excellent as always, but unfortunately she does not have an original story to back up her great performance.  What we are left with is a very formulaic thriller that offers nothing new to the genre.  Even though THE RING has elements from every recent horror film from THE SIXTH SENSE to SESSION 9 to 13 GHOSTS, it still manages to keep the audience entertained and on the edge of their seat.  As is typical with these films, the best moment is in the last minute of the film and there is a lot of the BOO!!! scares that seem to come out of left field, but you know they are coming. In a slow week at the megaplex, this should pass the time.",6,0,0,14 October 2002
