Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Could have been better .
","First of all , seeing this movie in 3D is pointless, and its a total rip-off . You can take your glasses off and still the picture quality is good, so the producing company legalized robbery and made me pay twice the amount for a ticket on a movie that is sold as being in '3D'. But its not the only movie that did this , i see its a common practice these days.As far as the script is concerned , the dialogue could have been better and there we're quite a few cringe and clichéd moments , especially how they handled the love story between the mermaid and the missionar.And while i do get its supposed to be a fun adventure movie for everyone , they could have worked more a bit on the villain, its so one dimension and the way they choose to portrait Blackbeard's cruelty was laughable and not in a good way .Overall the movie was pretty OK, had some good lines from Barbosa as always , but i suppose after 3 movies to me it just becomes formulaic. The movie is worth going to the cinema but only for the normal version, the 3D is a rip-off cause of these damn greedy companies.",6,0,0,21 May 2011
Pacific Rim," This was so lame ,predictable and boring...
","I don't know what other movie people saw, but I for one I'm not impressed by some special effects anymore . Got to see this movie with some friends and based on the reviews I saw on this website we thought it would be fun .The movie started OKs first 20 min they build it up nice , then could have skipped the next hour, utterly pointless , the story predictable, full of cliché lines and just a waste of time, and I don't know what was wrong with the girl playing the 'love interest' but when she was attempting to cry or give some longing look i started laughing and when they tried to make a funny scene you could see it miles away and i wanted to cry how awful the script was. And Charlie, I like him in SoA but he didn't have to go to that much trouble to play Jax in this movie as well .Well the action scenes we're OK I suppose if your into big things.. and even those had their 'genius' moments like the sword and its 'analogical' ...moment , granted If the intention was to ridicule and make me laugh at the absurdity of its logic then it did its job.By the time this movie was nearing the end , I was at least hoping the director of the movie could have the decency to just kill them off, instead i got to see Jax fondling that annoying 14 year old (yea ... i know the actress is like 30+ but that doesn't change the fact that in the movie she looks and acts like 14-15).In conclusion if this what entertains people in this day , then by all means, let the monsters loose , at least we get a good show ...",1,160,286,14 July 2013
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," How could they fu#% this up so badly ...
","Especially considering they did LOTR trilogy . Awful script , badly edited , comic/drama mashed together because the director presumed that amongst all that carnage you need to laugh ... The shitty henchman from the village that was put for comic relief had more screen time then the dwarfs in the mountain , are they fu... kidding me...The big fight , they should have put a few kids from kindergarten to preview the fight , because even them would have asked questions like where did the magical goats appeared from ? , the floating elves over the entire dwarf army, the killing spree reindeer... and many more. For me the funniest moment had to be the giant ogre slamming the walls with his head, that alone was worth the price of admission . The CGI was better 12-13 years ago when they did the first movies , maybe because they didn't use so much of it... On the positive side the cast did its best with what little they had to work with and i liked they showed Galadriel's true power . A special mention for Guillermo , that guy is a fraud that ruins everything he touches , he had 1 good movie some years back the one with the labirint, and since then he's been making nothing but cheesy movies that are suppose to be great cause all the special effects . Attaching this guy to this project was a major mistake. The ending left various unfinished subplots, but who cares .. this movie will make billions . Such a disappointment , because once again these people did do the LOTR trilogy ...",1,44,85,20 December 2014
The Water Diviner," Silly, illogical, ridiculous.
","Saw this movie as there was nothing else on cinema this week, and seeing Russel starring in this one , i thought it couldn't be that bad . Damn i was so wrong.The first 20 minutes are just badly edited the way they try to setup the story , as it is just confusing in the way they transmit information to the public . Long pointless shots from start to finish of the movie that are sooo boring and just make you roll you're eyes out.Illogical, the only thing missing from the way Russel manages to find his kids, was his dead wife appearing as a ghost and pointing the grave site , at least we would have had some supernatural elements in the movie and that would have been an explanation.Russel's love interest is so forced and out of place you just want to bang you're had on the table .The music is just so awful over the top, and really annoying , the only good music was the one song from the army , those guys can sing ! The fighting scenes are reasonably done , even tho some lack some common sense in the way they planned them . The movie has some beautiful landscape shots .Overall avoid the movie , from the moment you see a character you know what will happen to them as the movie reaches his conclusion everything is as was predicted , even tho the way they reach is illogical, ridiculous and really just silly .",1,63,140,24 January 2015
Me Before You," Pretty good
",I liked this movie. I like the dialogue its quite charming and the comedy bits work really well .I was pleasantly surprised that there were not cliché moments and the flow of the story came naturally . The 2 main characters have great chemistry and Emilia Clark is simply adorable .Its a simple story told well.The director of the film did a good job overall however there was 1 problem with this movie and that was the soundtrack they used . Except the 2 bits of classic music the rest of it was simply abysmal and it really hurt the movie . It gave that cheesy soapy feel of a telenovela episode.But getting past that i really enjoyed this movie more then i thought i would and i would recommend watching this . Have fun!,8,14,23,1 July 2016
