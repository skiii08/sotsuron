Angels & Demons," disappointing
","I have been reading Dan brown novels ever since they first came in the market they all represent perhaps in a fictitious story an idea which may not be so untrue his books are real wealth of knowledge and i can't even imagine how much research he must have put it to actually write that kind of stuff. Angels and demons by Dan brown gave a lot of it's volume to explain the scientific stuffs like anti-matter and many things see the basic idea of novel is to actually bring to surface the centuries old war of science and religion. Told in a way well only way i can describe it is like attending a Howard lecture on a roller coaster ride. To be honest this movie is really well made if you are looking for good direction , great acting of course by tom hanks, great special effects especially the one where bomb goes off. But for me as a read of the novel i came in expecting the movie to have a strong message which will force us to think about stuffs. That certainly did not happen with the disastrous plot they had in order to make the movie small and you know one of those action thrillers they make these days they just killed the whole soul of the novel The most disastrous of all was the character of camerlengo his portrayal in the movie was like a hungry for power hound as compared to a very complex one shown in the novel of being a mis directed but good at heart kinda guy. Anyways for me the movie was one of the biggest disappointment being a reader of the novel more so because it was of tom hanks. but i guess if you haven't read the novel you shouldn't really care much about those things just put it in the category of indiana jones and you will enjoy it.",5,0,0,15 November 2010
Life Is Beautiful," Along with Cinema Paradiso, The best of Italian Cinema
","This movie deserves to be in Top 10 of the list on the least. I think after Apocalypse now this has to be one of the most hard movies to make, Apocalypse now required an extremely large amount of resources in practical terms, however Life is Beautiful, is a movie that is very hard to present without hurting any sentiments which it manages perfectly, This is just top class cinema from the beginning, it's not slapstick or cheap comedy, it's humor in it's purest form, an ode to human emotions. The acting the presentation, the development of the characters is perfect, Roberto Benigini, plays an extremely hard character trying to balance his daily life in the concentration camp, while protecting his son's innocence by telling him that it's all a game, with the first prize being a REAL TANK,This movie could have gone wrong at so many places so easily, amazingly it never does, Roberto Benigini was walking on a very thin wire while making this film, but he does it to perfect, absolute perfection.Easily one of the best cinema in the past two decades.",10,1,1,20 May 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Masterpiece
","You know it's really not the most entertaining movie ever made. you might look around the theater and see people yawning or even sleeping i guess it's not avatar where you get CGI things or these 3D animation movie they make these days nor any batman or superman thing to thrill you with the action. What makes this motion picture special is that you will grow to love this movie , the first time you walk out of threatre you may not think of it as the greatest movie ever made , but there's something about it which makes you see it again and again and each time you see it you learn something new from it. you may be impressed by these great budget movie they make these days but you surely wont watch it a hundred times literally. Count my words you will watch this movie that many times. It's a story about hope as many people have already said in the review also about friendship and almost all these great human emotions. Great great soundtrack by thomas newton is like a cherry on the cake.The movie is so realistic and so much real at places it actually makes you angry, yet it's not a depressing movie like schindler's list or a fairy tale one like forrest gump , it's just a story which gives you hope and strength to face life and value it. believe me lol i have watched a lot of movies and this IS THE BEST ONE.",10,1,1,7 October 2010
