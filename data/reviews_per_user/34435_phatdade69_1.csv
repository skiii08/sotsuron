Requiem for a Dream," Edge of your seat, but eyes to the skies.
","The movie succeeded at keeping your attention, but there were too many moments where I realized I was lying on the bed waiting for something to finally happen instead of being lost in the film. The movie would have gotten an 8 from me since the photography, the segues, and the characters were great, but the ending was like an evening of mad passionate love which ends with an 'OWWW cramp! I gotta go sit down!' Better than Pi though. I have always been impressed with the magnetic quality of the movie which has actors with familiar faces flocking to it. Often times a more indie-wanna-be style film such as this one is littered with people whom you will never see again. Impressive star power considering the category of this film.",7,0,1,23 April 2006
