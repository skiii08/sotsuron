United 93," United 93; a dramatic and heartbreaking film that reenacts the happenings of September 11th.
","This may contain spoilers! It was a great movie. The acting was great. They were true to the story. It was brilliant. I do recommend seeing it. It was also one of the saddest movies I have ever seen. The ending was dramatic and heartbreaking and it was so poignant and so sad that I got a stomach ache. When the passengers attacked the cockpit it was so brutal and painful to see them keep going when it seemed like they would not make it. And when the passengers called their families and friends giving messages of love and goodbyes to them it made me think of how precious our time with our family and friends are. The people on that plane gave their lives to their country and that demands respect. Although they were scared they fought and bleed giving courage to their country when it would need it most. I understand it is a most controversial movie. But I do recommend seeing it. The makers of this movie are patriots, as are the people who lost their lives that day. May God bless them and keep them safe.",Null,1,3,6 May 2006
