The Blair Witch Project," Largely dull
","I cannot imagine why this film is being looked at as the template for 'alternative' filmmaking in the next couple of years. To paraphrase Chris Rock, 'This movie cost $50,000? Where the f-ck is the other $49,000?' The concept was good; the execution was poor.Having more of a script, and presenting the 'found footage' as part of a larger pseudo-documentary as was once part of the filmmakers' plans, certainly would have improved the work as a whole. But, then they wouldn't be able to sell you 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'Curse of the Blair Witch' separately.Oh -- the last 30 seconds were rather frightening.",3,0,1,8 November 1999

Spider-Man," Catches the feel of the comic, but where's Gwen Stacy?
","I saw 'Spider-Man' yesterday with my wife, who is not a comics reader. Both of us enjoyed the movie, which we can best describe as 'fun.' The acting is passable, largely because the script is only passable.  The only outstanding performance is by J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson; he makes the most of a small role and hits the comics character's tone dead-on. While Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe sometimes walk through the movie (except in big dramatic scenes), their performances are satisfying, if not spectacular. Kirsten Dunst, however, is atypically flat as Mary Jane Watson.Dunst was miscast, in my opinion. M.J. is a stunner, a true knockout, the girl who told Peter Parker, upon their first meeting in the comics,'Face it, Tiger! You just hit the jackpot!' She needs to be gorgeous and sexy, and Dunst is pretty and sympathetic. With her round face and sweet demeanor, Dunst would have been well cast as Gwen Stacy, the first true love of Peter's life.***SPOILER WARNING***The love of Peter's life, that is, until Spider-Man failed to save her from the Green Goblin, who knocked the unconscious Gwen off the George Washington bridge. Spidey caught her with a webline, but the whiplash of the sudden stop broke her neck.This sequence is more or less recreated during the movie when Mary Jane is dropped off the bridge by the Goblin as Peter faces a 'Sophie's Choice' situation -- save M.J. or the tram full of kids. The movie cheats by having Spider-Man defy the law of gravity. By pushing off the bridge with his powerful legs, he manages to accelerate faster than the already falling objects, something which is impossible without artificial propulsion. Peter does this twice in the film, the first time during the World Unity Day battle when he dives past the falling M.J. to catch her and 'bungie-web' them both to the ground. I guess love is a powerful motivator.***END SPOILERS***Despite this, despite the obvious use of CGI in many of the action sequences, and despite the fact that Spider-Man's mask clearly is a separate piece of cloth when necessary but is connected to the rest of the INCREDIBLE costume most of the time (a problem also seen in the comics), I enjoyed the film a great deal. I do wish Peter had been canny enough to pitch his voice differently when suited up (a basic superhero point that both the Superman and Batman movies have used to good effect). People you know well can recognize your voice, even through a cloth mask!'Spider-Man' is a good, enjoyable movie-movie. It's more fun than 'X-Men,' certainly more interesting than 'Blade,' but not quite up there with 'Batman Returns' and 'Superman.' Take a friend, take your spouse if he or she can get into some outrageous action that's more plausible than what you see in the average Schwarzenegger picture.One caveat: During the show I attended, a child no more than five sat down the aisle from me. He seemed to enjoy the show immensely (at least from his smiles when the credits rolled), but my wife and I both thought the picture was too intense for young children during Osborne's tortured multiple personality discussions and the fight scenes -- the brutal final battle most of all. This movie is rated PG-13 with good reason. I know people drag kids no older than 10 to R-rated films, but the MPAA usually isn't kidding when it says 'Parents Strongly Cautioned' and 'No One Under 17 Admitted Without Parent or Guardian.'",7,0,0,5 May 2002
From Hell," We left the theater yelling, 'This was the movie from Hell!'
","As a great fan of Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's original graphic novel and an admirer of the Hughes Brothers, I had rather high hopes for 'From Hell' when first I heard of its production. As its release date neared, though, and details of the film began to leak out, I became distressed by the broad changes the film's writers had made to Moore's original story, apparently with the consent of the Hugheses. Moore's story is not a mystery; neither, of course, is it a documentary of the case. He admits the novel is a work of fiction and has said that his choice for the identity of the Ripper is most unlikely. The Ripper case, its drama, and its continuing fascination was a hook on which to hang a social commentary -- and this, along with much of the historical research Moore and Campbell put into the book -- is what is missing from the Hughes Brothers' movie. The brothers are working with some very talented people these days, and they've made a very good-looking an good-sounding film, but at its heart, it's empty. Pretty as the cinematography is, talented as most of the actors are, 'From Hell' is dull. It hasn't the thrills to qualify as a decent thriller, the chills to make a satisfying horror movie, the emotionally involving characters to draw us into a human drama. 'From Hell' is a mess, and you'd do well to spend your money elsewhere.",4,2,4,28 October 2001
