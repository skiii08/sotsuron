Catch Me If You Can," Super movie
","This movie catch me on my seat from the first minute. Every minute had something to show us. Tom Hanks, as one of my favorite actors, made an exceptional acting here. Leo DiCaprio had a pretty cool character and it was very good performed. The story of Frank Abagnale is very interesting as the whole movie, the script was very well adapted from the book.I recommend it 9/10",9,1,2,6 March 2016
