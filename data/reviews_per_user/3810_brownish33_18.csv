Gremlins," Silly, funny, but a little too dark at times
","firstly, i just bought this on bluray last night and haven't seen this film in a very long time. but after seeing it after so many years in full, i must say its darker then i remembered it. the gizmo is cute in the beginning, and i half expected this movie to be not so dark because gizmo was so fluffy and cute. however once the other gremlins come it gets a bit dark. perhaps too dark. first thing that made me gasp in horror was when its implied the spike mogwi (not yet turned into a gremlin) tied up the dog outside with Christmas lights. that was just so wrong. i didn't find it funny, but i don't think it was supposed to be. I'm sure it was meant to show how bad and sadistic the gremlins can be, and it sure did, but as an owner of 4 lovable dogs and a big animal lover myself i found this part to be in bad taste. thankfully the dog wasn't hurt in the film or anything, but still, it looked painful and i felt very bad after seeing this, and i had to go hug my own dogs, lol. later in the film you see gremlins with GUNS trying to shoot people, injecting a needle into a teacher, scratching up a moms face while in a Christmas tree before trying to strangle her, nearly bulldozing a man to his death (thankfully later was confirmed that he survived that somehow). from memory, the gremlins of film 2 were not nearly as sadistic or murderous. sometimes scary or creepy but not like the first film where they were killers. anyone who says this is a 'family' movie should be warned. its a strange movie to be sure, its got moments where the kids would definitely enjoy it (as i did when i was a child) and parts where adults are going to think 'wow this is pretty twisted'. phoebe Cate's character's speech about why she doesn't like Christmas was pretty bizarre as many have stated and just doesn't fit anywhere in the movie. maybe this was why they added it on there, the ridiculous randomness of it, but still, it would have been fine without it.another thing that people don't seem to give credit for is jerry goldsmiths very memorable film score which really suits the movie and is both scary at times, and funny/silly at others, especially with his very funny, memorable 'gremlins theme' tune. you can almost hear the gremlins singing along with it! overall, however, the creature gremlin effects are fantastic and very well done. it reminds us that CGI can never replace the pure magic and creepy realism of puppetry and animatronics that were so wonderful back in the day. this film also reminded me why so many of my favorite films are from the 80's. movies then seemed to have a childlike fun quality to them that seems lost in todays cinema. they were fun, over the top and magical, from the kid movies to the macho action flicks, 80's movies had that magic of cinema that todays films are sorely missing. the film's got plenty of scares and silliness, as well as some good suspense, to entertain just about anyone who likes movies. my only major criticism is that there are some moments that i think are just too dark for a movie like this. i actually prefer the sequel, where i think they got a good balance of silliness and creep out scenes, without being too serious or too dark. on the whole, the 2 gremlins films are very good scary fun movies but do be warned, the first film does get dark at times and may not be great for younger viewers. i wouldn't really call this a 'family' film, more like a horror comedy.",6,1,2,7 October 2010
Mission: Impossible III," Hysterically awful, no joke!
","it felt like some basic cheesy cliché action movie, with the quick cuts and lethal weapon-type action. nothing new. the intro was so stupid, like who cares? stop showing tom cruise cry like a baby for his 'girl'. i liked john woos slow motion artsy-type fights TONS better (not to mention cruise looking cooler with long hair and real 'dude' like). the other 2 felt more original in a sense, with the first one still being the best of the 3, as usual. this movie felt more like a rip of the Bourne movies, which i also think suck. and the dialogue was terrible, TERRIBLE, like that Humpty Dumpty line which fit no purpose at all, like am i watching MI movie or sponge bob? the villain, Seymour whatever, he was lame. REALLY lame. worst villain in any action movie i have ever seen. he was like this total nerd that acted like a tough guy or something, like he just came off as hysterically funny to me. he never seemed deadly, just weird and funny, like he was doing a comedy. the whole part with Ethan almost ejecting him off the plane was HYSTERICAL!!!! i laughed a lot at that scene, like i actually had tears in my eyes laughing. same with Keri Russel getting killed that her brain imploded, LOL, her face and everything, and it was like supposed to be all intense but came off REALLY silly and funny. i just thought this was the worst entry in the series by far, i hope they don't make any more and JJ Abrams really sucks with directing. just terrible. i also thought cruise 'marrying' someone and living a 'normal' life was also pathetic. this is a mission impossible action film and they tried to make it all emotional and deep. oh brother, this is why the first one is tons better, even the 2nd. and his girls comment about the name IMF stands for was utterly ridiculous, like what is this a movie or a self parody? horrible. and the plot was also a lot of drivel, didn't make ANY sense, about the stupid 'rabbits foot', oh brother, thats so cliché and typical to keep you in suspense, like What is a rabbits foot? i say, who CARES! it was stupid anyway! and Laurence fishburne was totally wasted in this. my opinion? don't see this one, only if you like lame brained action movies with bad dialogue and stupid plots.",1,1,5,10 November 2011
Batman Returns," 20 years on and still the better Batman movie
","Yikes, cant believe this film has reached its 20th anniversary! I was only 5 when this hit theaters but I do remember watching this many times on videotape. Anyway, I'm here to give the new revised review of this amazing film. Looking back at the batman movies, this one comes off as rather unique. Its not your atypical comic book movie in that it doesn't just have loads of action with one fight scene after another. not that it doesn't have its fair share of exciting action scenes, but its more about the characters and how they relate to each other, almost like little character studies. there's a reason why the tagline for the movie is 'the bat, the cat, the penguin'. the movie is all about these 3 characters. One thing that strikes me is the emotional level this film achieves. Its quite amazing what Burton did with the characters, particularly the 2 villains. In the comic books, they are very 2-dimensional characters. Catwoman is just a hot chick who likes to steal things, and Penguin is just a little roly poly guy who wears a tux. If there were ever 2 characters that were in dire need of a face lift, its these 2. Tim Burton gives them both a rather incredible amount of depth and pathos. Penguin is a deformed guy who years after being dumped in the sewer, seeks revenge not only against Gotham city, but more specifically, its children. Talk about a disturbed individual. Catwoman on the other hand was a quiet put upon woman treated badly by her employer, who eventually tries to kill her. This makes her go into a fit of rage, a sequence in which Selina totally lets loose in her apartment, which is quite a powerful scene and which also shows why I love Michelle pfeiffer. Very, very talented actress. Its in this moment she becomes cat woman. Sure beats the hell out of the comics version. Then there is Batman, once again dark and brooding Michael Keaton, born to play this part, who has seemingly no life beyond waiting for that big bat in the sky to call him to duty. During the course of the movie, all these characters go in and out of each others lives, betray each other, love each other, fight each other. The 3 leads are superb together, and the casting for this movie is PERFECT. I mean cmon, who else could possibly play the Penguin? Seriously? But besides the action scenes and the amazing visuals that Burton does so well, there is something about this movie, a kind of sad feeling, especially during the climax. These aren't just your typical run of the mill comic book villains and heroes. These are deeply hurt, deeply scarred people who inhabit this dark wonderland of Gotham city. The penguin acts and behaves like your usual crazy super villain, but at the same time you realize, why is he targeting little kids as his aim of his revenge? Because he himself was thrown into the sewer as a small child and now wants to reenact this on the children of Gotham. Hes hurting. Catwoman and Batman are both messed up which makes them perfect for each other, but they can never truly be together because of the very things that draw them together. The ballroom scene between Selina and Bruce is one of the best scenes in the movie. What can I say, Tim Burton is a master of visuals, a true genius of dark filmmaking. Such is his talent of creating an amazing and creepy atmosphere. He is, as far as I'm concerned, the only guy fit to direct a batman movie. He just gets it. The nerds and basment dwellers who judge a movie simply on how accurate it is to the source material are just narrow minded haters, especially since its popular right now to hate on the older films in order to 'prop up' the newer movies. the comics by the way, are not the Bible. characters and origins are constantly changing and being re-envisioned by different artists writers. one minute penguin is a tux wearing, snooty, intelligent human being, the next hes a monstrous, bulbous, disgusting slob with claws/'flippers' and long greasy hair. nothing remains the same for too long in the comics, so when it comes to comic books, nothing in set in concrete. its more up to personal taste, and i believe that burton took the source material and simply added to its greatness. he took the characters and made them so much more compelling then they ever were in the comic books. isn't that what the films are supposed to do?Its really quite sad to see people and the weird crazy internet culture having this massive hard-on for Christopher Nolan's boring, bourgeois bland take on the character. heath ledger did not deserve the Oscar, and was the worst version of joker I've ever seen. Out of all 6 batman films made, none of them I believe have the same kind of raw emotion of this particular batman film. I also like the film also because it deals with outcasts, of which I feel very much an outcast in many ways so I can relate to it. Heck even here on IMDb I am an outcast, as I hate movies that most people seem to love and I love movies people seem to hate! I hate the new Batman's. I think they are dull lifeless garbage. Does that make me Mr. popular or what? But I stick to my thoughts and wont bend just to make some stupid shmoe happy. So there's always this tension with people because my tastes are different. Lets face facts here, most modern versions of thing's suck, and that includes the new batmans. the original 3 are the best, simple as that.",10,4,12,29 June 2012
The Expendables," Best action film in years
","I saw this when it came out in the theater, and i now own it on bluray DVD. this is Stallone's 3rd awesome hit hes made in recent years. he went away for a while, but he came back as strong as ever with Rocky Balboa, which was surprisingly great and touching. then he brought Rambo back as hard hitting (and as violent) as ever. now comes Stallone's 3rd hit, Expendables. and let me tell you, its got everything you could want: loads of action upon action, a cast of Grade A action stars, hot female lead, great dialog and some truly funny humor. this was Stallone trying to recapture the energy and explosiveness of those infamous 80's action films he used to make (heck, still does) and it does not disappoint. the chases are done very well, the acting is top notch for a film like this, and the hand to hand combat is pretty spectacular, especially considering Stallone's age. he really is a legend, and hes still got it! this was better then many of the other so-called 'action' movies that are flooding theaters lately, like those terrible Bourne movies, all those TV show remakes, the new Batman's, etc. this beats them all, because it doesn't pretend to be something more then it is: a really bad ass action movie. no silly pretentious rambling monologues, no sappy love stories, no soap opera drama. just plain and simple ass kicking, balls to the wall action, but not without connecting you with the characters. the other great thing is that this is an ORIGINAL. not a remake, not a sequel, not a 'reboot', a totally original film with stallone. the team mentality is cool here, WAY better then the new A team movie. these guys are the real deal. words i suppose cannot describe how just plain cool this movie is. action stars from this generation as well as the last are all here, all the big names, even a cameo from ARNIE and Bruce! jet Li is hilarious, SO awesome to see Ivan drago back fighting rocky...ER i mean Dolph lundren fighting Stallone once again! Eric Roberts plays the typical skeevy sleaze bag hes so good at, stone cold.....what a MONSTER. this guy is scary, and plays a formidable foe to sly and his gang of freedom fighters. mickey Rourke provides the heart and soul and the movie, with one truly amazing scene where he talks about how he could have saved his soul by saving another's. almost brought tears to my eyes. in short, this is probably one of THE best most fulfilling action experiences in recent years. in a time filled with CGI overload and everything seems to take itself so seriously, here comes a movie that doesn't try to be anything other then a simple giant blockbuster filled to the brim with brutal fist fights and explosions. i hope Hollywood is taking notes here: THIS is how to make an proper action movie, the way they USED to make them. the movie has it all, and i am really hoping the sequel will be just as good, if not better.",10,4,8,15 April 2012
Over the Top," One of the Greatest 80's Inspirational Stallone movies EVER!
","i saw this movie, most of it, when i was a kid and haven't seen it in years. so i saw this movie as a double-movie DVD with Demolition Man, and i love Stallone so i got it. i LOVED it, so i naturally go on IMDb to look it up. this just goes to show you the nature of the IMDb raters. no wonder this movie has such a low rating: no blood and gore, no meaningless violence, no cursing and explosions, no nihilistic dark tone. ya know, none of the stuff that drives a todays audience. instead its meaningful, touching, inspirational and heartfelt movie with a sensitive Stallone and no meaningless stupidity, and just the right amount of action. yep, this movie sucks.I'm being sarcastic of course.The movie deals with Stallone as a truck driver who left his wife and young son behind years ago. his son is now about 10 years old and his dying wife wants Lincoln hawk aka Stallone, to be a father to his son and bond after she dies. of course the evil grandfather thinks hawk is worthless scumbag which is totally not true and tries everything to keep them apart. hawk is a great driver and arm wrestler and looks to win the law Vegas tournament, but not before him and his son bond for the first time in a truck drive across the country. some great emotional, even tear jerking moments here and i enjoyed this movie immensely. its one of those great 80's edge-of your-seat movies that makes you really root for the hero Stallone. once again Stallone writes and acts and plays the underdog, very similar to Rocky.i know today we are living a real screwed up world where people love 'darkness' and 'grittiness' and 'realism' in movies but cm on! that sh** tends to suck and bring you down! this movie was great not only as entertainment but its message of love and family, something you don't see much of anymore. some 80's movies really knew how to do this, and do it well. i really enjoyed it and it made me laugh, cry, and root! not many movies do that to me. i deem this an unfair rating on IMDb. I'm not crazy about all 80's movies. heck, this movie came out the year i was born. but i really really enjoyed it. i like most of Stallone's movies, any time period, cuz he rocks. he always blends a macho ism with sensitivity for the most part, thats why i prefer him over Schwarzenegger for the most part. hes not just a killing machine, hes got heart. and thats reason enough to enjoy this movie, you really care about the characters.",10,2,6,7 October 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," An extremely action packed, visual delight that will not disappoint action fans!
","OK, i am a pretty big Matrix fan, and i decided to write a small review for this particular movie because its the one film of the whole trilogy that seems to be looked down upon, but usually thats by those who simply don't understand it or the ending. these movies are not for the simple minded in my opinion. they seem to be geared towards ppl who like to think, ponder, and question films. i am not into science fiction......AT ALL. most of the movies i tend to enjoy are action and adventure, which i believe the matrix films could also fit into that category, but these films firmly belong i think to scifi, and its strange that i should love these movies so much. but they really are the only scifi movies that i enjoy, along with perhaps Terminator 2 and Independence Day. first and foremost, these movies are visually amazing, and particularly the 2 sequels, with the 3rd one being the big giant monster sized movie full of special effects, amazing action sequences, and flat out some of the coolest stunts your likely to ever see in this genre. plenty of eye candy, so to speak, and it is surely worth seeing if your any kind of action fan. the movie takes place right after the 2nd, and just takes off. neo must find out what he must to do save Zion and end the war, and the movie certainly has a apocalyptic feel to it. the big battle in Zion that has been hinted or talked about in the last 2 films finally arrives, and it does NOT disappoint. the humans, piloted in these huge metal me ch suits called APU's defend Zion in what is probably the best man VS machine battle in film history, with sentinels swarming everywhere like waves of water crashing down on the outnumbered humans, who surprisingly can hold there own against the machines pretty damn well with huge amounts of ammo being shot, and i mean HUGE. explosions galore, hovercraft's flying through sewers at incredible speed. we finally see the surface of planet, which is pretty amazing, even if it is taken over by machines. and then huge big battle between neo and smith as they fly through the air like supermen. the final fight between them is awe inspiring, the flying and rain/water effects, lightning, its just all like WOW, i cant believe they managed to make a fight between 2 guys flying around awesome and incredible! the movie has got a ton of this like comic book type action and the story, while some may not get it, is still very interesting and a fitting ending to this Awesome yet unusual action trilogy. i really enjoyed it and it looks AMAZING on blue ray and my hi-def TV. highly recommended if you want a pure knock your socks off action ride!",10,0,2,14 June 2010
The Thing," A bloody mess and too gross-out for its own good
","so i just rented this movie, I'm only 22 but being on the internet hearing so much about this horror movie 'the thing', i knew that despite me hating bloody/gory movies, i was eventually gonna have to see it. well this is my take: sure it was creepy and pretty disturbing effects and the tension and paranoid feeling is OK (although done better in older scifi films like 'body snatchers') but lets face it, this movie was and is a cult movie. no way this was ever going to be a mainstream film. and today, movies like this that are old and gross seem to be very popular in todays goth/punk culture of death, anyone notice? no wonder its got such a (highly undeserved) rating on IMDb! older movies from the 70's/80's that are known to be gross and twisted with those supremely gross special effects are actually more popular now then they were back then. i think its just a stupid trend and shows was perverted times were are living in. movies like the thing, army of darkness, Texas chainsaw massacre, Halloween etc (just look at all the new remakes!) are all more popular now then they were back in the day. and no greater example of this then the Thing. i think its just a really lame trend that needs to go away and fast! this movie was a onetime view and nothing more. certainly not something you can watch 20+ times unless your like a sick freak or something. seeing ppls heads getting torn apart and see poor innocent dogs getting brutally attacked by some idiot monster (guess there isn't intelligent life out there huh?) just isn't my idea of a good time at the movies. movies IMO are meant to make you feel good or if anything, have the good guy win in the end. but movies like this are dumb and depressing. i don't need real life fear in movies, unless i know the good guy is gonna kill the evil thing. i just think movies like this are too gross for there own good. i mean, you didn't see movies like this in the 1950's or even the 60's that much. pretty scary when you think that you can get away making disturbing movies like this, and they are even worse today! thanks to movies like the Thing and even Alien, we now have these insanely graphic gross-out movies by the ton. well, you can be sure i will never give them the time of day. I'm not a fan of ultra scifi cuz most of scifi tends to be creepy, gross and depressing with always a question to things. i don't like that, reminds me too much of real life. but there are some 'alien' movies i really do enjoy, like Independence Day, Star Wars movies, Predator (which although it has SOME blood, its certainly not over the top gross like some of these others). but overall, not a big scifi fan, and the thing is just too gross for anyone IMO. only the most depraved of people would actually enjoy this kind of movie, along with the evil dead and other films of that ilk.",1,20,91,21 April 2009
Rocky IV," BEST Rocky Sequel!!
","Seriously, i cannot think of one that is more entertaining, awesome and fun and with some seriously awesome training montages. sure this was the most 80's of the bunch but is that a bad thing? the rock ballads and the music-video vibe at times. it was great, funny, emotional, and just plain awesome! drago was the coolest icy'est villain ever! and a killer fight at the end. i just thought it was great, the Rocky series certainly reached its peak with this one. too bad about rocky 5. heck even as good as rocky 6 was, this one was still more awesome. it was sly at his peak of awsomness, and looked in best shape in this one too. sure it didn't have that super emotional story of 'the underdog trying to beat the champion of the world' but it was a grand film about vengeance and kicking communist Russia's red ass! epic rocky right here!",10,2,7,8 December 2009
Independence Day," ID4 = One of the coolest action films EVER!
","so, once again I'm reviewing a movie that i grew up with. i was a child of the 90's, and i distinctly remember 3 films my mom bought on video when they came out: Mission Impossible, Twister, and ID4. ID4 was my favorite of the 3, and still is. there is a lot more to this film then just the special effects. its got heart. thats why i like it. there is also this kind of innocence to it, a child like sense of wonder that has only been seen in films like the original Star Wars. it doesn't take itself ultra seriously but seriously enough for you to feel for the characters. Jeff goldbloom is one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him in this. Jurassic park and ID4 are 2 of my favorite action films so seeing him in this as well was a great treat. will smith, before he became huge with 'Men In Black' the following year, was also great and funny as well. bill pullman is very good as the president, he definitely looks like one here and is very likable and perhaps a bit too 'calm' when the aliens take over. if that were me i would have been going crazy, yet Pullman's president stays strangely calm and collected throughout. amazing! we need a president that is that cool under pressure! harry connick junior makes a brief but memorable role as the 'biggs' character for this movie (for those star wars fans out there, you know what i mean). there were a lot of parts in this movie that seemed directly lifted from the original Star Wars. the giant saucer ships are like the death star, the F-18's have replaced X-wings and likewise the alien attackers have replaced Tie Fighters. you even have a unlikely hero like Luke skywalker in randy quaids character, especially at the very end in the plane.the movie has enough laughs and suspense to keep you going and is very well cast. the action however is simply amazing. you must remember, this was in a time when CGI had not yet taken over cinema, so computer effects were used at a minimum. but that is what makes the special effects in this movie GREAT! CGI today is terribly overused to the point where movies have come to look like video games. they look awful. the effects in the 80's and most of the 90's still used practical effects using models and miniature's for the action. and boy did they do an amazing job with ID4. the ships, particularly the mammoth command ships, are a site to see, especially if you have an HDTV on bluray. it is MASSIVE. they cover the cities like a huge shadow. it was obviously a real ship they used, not lame phony looking CGI. and the effect would not have looked anywhere near as real or scary if CGI was used. the explosions were also real. when the white house blew up, or the empire state building, or congress, those are REAL explosions, and WOW did it look impressive. you just don't see that kind of explosions today. take for example the newer Star Wars prequels. EVERYTHING looks fake! every set was blue screen and looked incredibly smooth and unreal. almost nothing was a prop or real set, it was just horrible. why don't they just go back to the way they used to film special effects? it looked 1 million times more real and actually were almost TOO real for comfort! again, they just don't make them like they used to and its sad.another thing to note is David Arnold's INCREDIBLE music score for this film. no, not that retarded REM song. i mean the film score itself. its very heroic, big, EPIC. it really makes you root for our heroes when the triumphant pro-American theme starts playing. it really gets your heart pumping with excitement when you couple the amazing action scenes with Arnold's superb score. the film wouldn't be anywhere near as good without it. parts that kind made me laugh was when they are planning the attack with all the countries, and when they show Russia, this very slavic sounding version of the ID4 theme is heard, complete with deep male singers and tambourine HAHA. this part was very old school. not to go overboard with the star wars references, but there were many moments in the score i noticed where it sounds very john William's-like, but thats fits this kind of movie perfectly.in the end, this is one of my favorite movies and despite what cynical reviewers may say, this is a great fun night out at the movies if there ever was one, right up there with original Star Wars trilogy! now go out and SEE IT!",10,1,4,20 October 2010
Batman Begins," Very Boring, Not Fun, and WAY Over-rated....
","Wow, can you say 'boring' any louder? I am a Batman fan, but this movie was just ridiculously boring. i mean seriously, it actually starts out with a little boy stealing a small rock from a little girl, and then he falls down a hole. talk about your exciting film openings. ah well, anyways, years later, he is Bruce Wayne, the only white man in an English-language Chinese prison. Bruce is pretty rich back in America, but he had himself sent to a Chinese prison so that he could train himself to beat people up, because he's peaved about his parents getting shot by a lame mugger. Okay. Then, he meets a guy with some sort of unpronounceable name, and this guy wants Bruce to join his group of evil ninjas. So, Bruce is like, 'Evil ninjas? Where do I sign up?' Of course, when the evil ninja training is finished (wich totally sucked) and they want him to kill somebody, Bruce freaks out and burns down the whole place, probably killing quite a few people, very not Batman like since he vowed not to 'kill' anyone(though Michael Keaton's wasn't a complete wimp like bale is here). Okay. Then, he goes home to rejoin the business world and fight crime. Luckily, he meets a guy at his father's company, and this guy makes superhero equipment for a living. Talk about your happy coincidences.David Goyer must be stopped. Seriously. I have no idea how anybody could have looked at the script for this ****ing abomination and said, 'Hey, I want to make that!' How many lame-brained action movie clichés can you fit into one film? How much cringe-worthy cheesy dialog can you make your overqualified cast choke out? How much cheesy sentimental bullshit can you squeeze into a movie about a guy fighting crime in a modified s&m outfit? If you're David Goyer, the possibilities are endless.I cannot believe the ratings this film has received. It is a good example of what happened in 'The Emperor's New Clothes'. Long story short, two con men convince everyone that they've made luxury clothes for a king when in reality, they have made nothing. According to them, only those worthy enough can see the clothes. Everyone fakes that they can see them, including a very naked king, so that they can feel worthy.My God, this fable fits 'Batman Begins' perfectly. It is an overblown, poorly written, stiffly acted, and badly photographed film. The action is completely 'been there done that' and is photographed WAY too up close, like many bad action movies of late. Christian Bale has a monotone voice and has NO EXPRESSION! Not ever. He frankly looks bored most of the time. That really bugged me. And yes, his voice as Batman was just plain embarrassing. It felt like an SNL skit of Batman.I truly think that the marketing of this film was solely based on the idea that 'Batman Forever' and 'Batman and Robin' sucked. They weren't good, but lets remember, they each made a good amount of money for so films so critically drubbed. But they made money because people were entertained, even if they are too chicken to admit it. But Nolan gets to show us that they were stupid and frivolous movies and that he's going to blow them out of the water by being adult and intelligent. Audiences don't want to feel stupid, they LIKE feeling smart, thus with open arms people have accepted 'Batman Begins' because they are told it is dark and unlike any other. But people truly are making more of 'Batman Begins' than it is.It strives so hard to be realistic and profound that it strips the energy and excitement form Batman. People talk in heavy handed riddles and the dialog is leaden and pretentious. And the plot is at times damn confusing. Characters appear and disappear, only to change motivations or create new motivations altogether. Blue flowers and weird organizations come about hoping the audience can fill in an explanation, and some Asian guy...has seemingly no purpose whatsoever, but appears in the film long enough so that one thinks hes there for a reason. Also, the montage of Batman training was very scatter shot. What did they show? Really...I think they just quickly edited a few hundred frames of nothing. The Pre-batman stuff, you know, the 'Begins' part of the film, wasn't very strong at all.In the end, I didn't care for anyone, because no one was developed! You can talk about fear all you want, but fear is not a character trait, nor is revenge, and Bruce had seemingly no character beyond this. Maybe its Bale's fault, as he was stiff as a corpse, but Bruce never felt real.This is so far a very harsh review, so why would I even give the film a 4/10, when thus far it seems closer to a 2/10 from my perspective? Out of respect to Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkonson. By casting respected, award-winning actors in small parts, some which are truly perfunctory, each man is only given a few moments to strut their stuff. I cherished those moments because even in a bad movie, these guys can act. But really, Gary Oldman in a small role as a humble cop who - basically does nothing?? Come on! Overall though, this is a huge letdown. People cite the darkness, and the depth of the characters, but the film is as deep as cardboard. You need not look farther than Bruce's relationship to Katie Holmes' character to see that this film is truly just a shallow hackneyed popcorn movie with a serious identity crisis, and really good marketing. If you want to see a REAL Batman movie that is not boring and actually takes risks and is original, see the aforementioned first 2 batman films BATMAN and Batman Returns. Thank you for reading.",1,7,19,13 May 2006
Caddyshack," Not Funny!
","i love bill Murray and to an extent Chevy chase, and i love Dangerfield! but i really disliked this movie, a lot. bill Murray had only a couple funny moments. i know he was just starting out in movies and was playing his typical dumb retard role, but he was painfully unfunny, which is shocking to me. the pool scene i thought was his funniest moment. Dangerfield was the funniest to me, but honestly, this movie was just NOT funny! animal house and this are probably the 2 most overrated stupid dumb movies I've ever seen! i don't watch comedies a lot because most 'modern' comedies are nothing but crude offensive humor. caddyshack isn't the worst in this regard but its just so....stupid. so stupid that its not funny. my dad loves this movie, he can quote it for crying out loud! but i found it just plain bad. the fact that Harold ramis wrote and directed these makes it even worse! i love that guy, especially as Egon, and i loved his other movies like groundhog day and analyze this, and vacation and stripes were pretty good too, and of course ghostbusters 1 and 2, but his 'early' films were really just banal fare for the 12-16 year old crowd who find potty jokes funny.",1,17,38,21 September 2011
The Dark Knight," Not a good Batman film. Over-rated in the Extreme.
","damn i cant believe the reviews for this film. I've only seen this twice and don't plan on seeing it again anytime soon, and this coming from a lifelong batman MOVIE fan (note the emphasis on MOVIE, not COMICS).I've seen the original film 200000 times and i loved all the sequels, even the 'campy' Schumacher ones. but boy did they take this franchise in a reverse direction. JUST because batman & robin was terrible and silly doesn't make Christopher Nolan's films the comic book equivalent of the 'godfather' or gone with the frigging wind. if anything, they only show how amazing Tim Burton's 2 original dual pictures are, and how utterly lame the Nolan ones are. not only is 'the dark knight' worse then batman begins, its downright ridiculous! you feel like you need a degree in law to understand what the hell they are talking about. its like CSI meets Gotham city. you might as well call this movie GCPD or GCPD Blue, or any of those law and order-type shows that this movie seems to copy from. its even more silly when you look at the lengths the director went through to make this batman movie as boring as possible. they seem to think 'if the story is engaging enough, we don't have to make the movie visually appealing'. thats like saying 'if the story is good enough, we don't have to make batman look awesome in the comics'.lets get this review started shall we? first, the joker. we are all familiar I'm sure with jack Nicholson's classic portrayal from the original film. it was truly amazing, he made the character eerie, funny, and charming all at once. yet he seemed to understand that this character is based off cartoons and as such you cant take yourself all that seriously. this is the complete opposite of what heath ledger does with the same role. but i guess you cant really blame the actor entirely with Nolan wanting to change up batman and his world to the point that the characters aren't really who they should be. first off, joker doesn't fall in a vat of acid like the original, he puts on makeup and cuts his own smile and dyes his hair green. i would hate to see his joker in the rain, he would look rather pathetic as a joker. i can guarantee that if Nicholson didn't already do this classic comics origin 20 years ago in the awesome first film, fan boys would be crying that joker was turned into common serial killer done a million times over in other films and not the funny amusing comic book clown prince of crime that everyone is more familiar with. oh, but since Nicholson already played THAT version to perfection, Nolan was somehow able to get away with turning joker into a common killer that we've seen time and again. Heath didn't really even play the﻿ Joker, he played 'generic serial killer bad guy #13314'. for those who would defend ledger by saying he was 'really scary and terrifying', sure ill give them that, but to say he was better than NICHOLSON?!? JACK FREAKING NICHOLSON?!? PLEEEEEEEEEEASE!!! The role was virtually MADE for the man when he was born.﻿ Nicholson captured the true essence of the Joker; a psychopathic man child out not to prove a good damn thing, but to kill and mess around with people all for the laughs. THESE are traits that define the Joker, not some cliché ideal of wanting people to accept that evil exists in all of us. and that brings me to another point, whats with this jokers anarchist pseudo-philosophic rambling monologues? boy Nolan LOVES these cardboard deep monologues he has his character spew out all the time, even in the last film. its laughable at how serious he takes the movie. did he forget this is based off of comic books and that there are supposed to be fun elements in the film? Tim Burton struck the perfect balance of comic book and reality. its somewhere right in the middle. Nolan puts a guy in a bat suit and places him right in middle of an unaltered real life city. it makes him look silly and out of place.I'm not gonna dwell much on bales batman. this guy cant save any movie hes in. people seem to love this guy, or think hes some brilliant actor, but hes obviously just a wooden actor and once again phoned in his 'performance' in this film. to quote Christopher walken from Batman Returns, 'hes just a poor schmo, who got lucky'. his batman voice is ludicrous. ludicrous! i still don't understand why they decided to make batman sound like an engine turning over. every time he talks he makes me laugh. the only decently done things in this film is how Harvey dent is portrayed (pre-twoface) and the pretty nifty bat pod, that has ONE cool scene in which it bursts from the bat mobile. but again, the action scenes never pick up because of Nolan's hard on for realism, so nothing in the new Batman films ever makes you go 'OOH Awesome' for too long. this movie just dragged and i remember looking at the clock as to when it would end. they make it feel like the new Batman's are 'smart' but honestly, in a comic book movie who the heck wants to listen to all this law and order talk and long drawn out 'deep' monologues? its so....meh. i'd rather watch jack Nicholson laugh like a maniac shooting his henchman and making me laugh. who can forget gems like 'bob, gun'. today you have 'why so serious?'. yeah thats what i want to know, why so serious Nolan?? why cant you make batman fun? nothing against having darkness, Burton's films were dark too but not so much to the point where they weren't fun or exciting. again, disappointed.",1,16,35,23 November 2011
Mission: Impossible," This is the only one that truly FELT like a MI movie
","this is such an under-appreciated movie, its definitely the best of the 3. didn't HATE the 2nd one, but the movie got way too stylized and 'rock & roll' looking. and the 3rd one......forget it, that one just sucked. unlike the 2 sequels, this one actually FEELS like a mission impossible movie. the other 2 just felt like typical action crap. this one had the cool gadgets, the 'agency' feel with all the different hackers and agents working undercover, the cool stealth-ness, it just had that 'spy/mission impossible' feel that the other ones got more and more away from. it also has an incredible danny elfman score that really got that spy/sneaky/action sound with the right hint of quirkiness, and no tampering with the original MI theme (at least until the U2 version at the end credits, which i thought was a brilliant take on the MI theme). the stunts were very 'MI' like, the whole fighting on the bullet train finale was amazing, and who could forget that scene of trying to quietly infiltrate CIA headquarters? that scene has been parodied time and time again, one of the best scenes in the movie. simply put, this is the best of the 3 films, and it has a good spy story to go with it. its not just tom cruise playing James bond, 'stopping the evil villain' etc, it actually was about him being framed by the agency and you don't even know who the real bad guy is until the end. it was really well done, and not THAT confusing. after you watch it a few times, you actually get it. the movie makes you THINK, which is what i like about it. and all the performances were great. ving raymes, tom cruise, everyone. if your going to see a Mission Impossible movie, see this one, the first and the greatest.",10,1,4,20 October 2010
Love Actually," Ugh, another poor post-modern view at love. Old fashioned romance movies are officially dead.
","so, a friend rented this movie and since she was a chick, i decided to sit through it. I'm a guy, but secretly i do enjoy those corny love movies, or 'chick flicks', every once in a while. however i tend to watch the ones that are shown on TCM or any old movie channel because old movies tended to have a sweetness and a kind of innocence to them. you weren't allowed to curse or show nudity or any of that. thats why i like those old fashioned romance movies. today, there is a fine line between romance movie and sex comedy. the only romance movie in recent times that i can think of that was actually good was 'a walk in the clouds' with keanu reeves. that movie was not ponly beautiful looking, but it had an old fashioned heart and a beauty on the inside that really touched me in a good way.however, films nowadays, i would even say for the past 30 or so years, romance films have been getting progressively worse. a 'romance' film these days must include senseless scenes of sex, nudity, swearing and sometimes very crude 'humour'. love actually isn't the worst when it comes to this, but this movie actually showed promise but again fell very short of what it could have been: a nice sweet tale of romance (or romance's). the perfect example of the grossness is the naked couple who are constantly talking while doing some kind of strange nude scenes. personally, i found these parts of the movie pretty distasteful for a 'romantic' movie. was it supposed to be funny? it was just weird, and odd. but they talk like they just met and they act all nervous and shy while doing these random sex acts? am i supposed to laugh at the paradox? wasn't funny to me, it actually was pretty sick. things like this in movies show just how uninhibited society has become where people can just get naked in front of you and act like its nothing (not saying everyone does but you get my point). pretty disturbing stuff. remember a time when women were so afraid to even show there knees or ankles? boy had the apple fallen far from the tree where you live in a society where prostituting ones self is perfectly normal and acceptable. very sad.the rest of the relationships offer nothing much that we haven't already seen elsewhere. i also didn't like the amount of swearing in it. it just came off as awkward and unneeded, especially since the film takes place around Christmastime. it could have been sweet. it could have been nice. but what it is is a post-modern strange look at love. the only story lines that were actually not too bad and kinda sweet was the writer falling in love with the house cleaner and the office woman who sacrifices love for her mentally ill brother. i have one question though: was is REALLY necessary for the house cleaner girl to take off all her clothes (in a very slow manner) just to jump in the lake? if she was in such a hurry to get the notes why would you feel the need to take off all your clothes? especially right in front of your employer? there were also some pretty random and pointless scenes of alan rickmans secretary taking off her clothes or walking around in lingeria. just, pointless stuff like this...i don't get it. and this movie is filled with them.there is one very funny moment with Rowan Atkinson aka Mr. Bean who appears at the jewelry counter. but really, the film could have been so much better. i didn't even like the environments, besides the writers house, all the houses/buildings looked so sterile and white and soulless. i also found liam neesons son's behavior to be so unrealistic. no 7 year old acts like that, or talks like that. and neeson talks to his very young son like hes teenager, mentioning things like 'haveing sex' and even saying 'who is she, or HE..' i was like, what? why would you automatically assume your son is gay? just weird. i heard about this film 7 years ago but i could tell what kind of movie it was going to be. lo and behold, i was correct. now i know why i hadn't been in any rush to see it. same with king Kong. heard about, it was popular, but deep down i knew it would suck. and i was right. anyway, sad to see liam neeson in such rubbish, but hey every actor needs work right? cant always be in those deep human drama's or action blockbusters like schindlers list or star wars, unfortunately. but he is still good even in this cold turkey of a 'love' movie. the days where you could go to a romance movie with a date or family are gone, as by 'romance' they now mean 'must be 18 years or older to attend this R rated sexual movie'. very very sad. now i know why i don't go to the movies anymore, not only is there a lack of good action adventure films, but also decent romantic films. i think i'll just stick with watching TCM for my romance fix.",1,4,8,8 October 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Thank the Maker that Nolan is done with Batman
","People complained about Batman not having enough screen time in 1992 with Batman Returns. well, here it is again. the big difference is that whenever batman appeared in the aforementioned film, it WAS batman, and he was cool. this is not the case with bale. i have now had to endure 2 movies that call themselves 'batman' movies, but cmon. don't kid yourself. this is not batman. frankly i am shocked at how the sheep have latched onto Nolan's batman, particularly TDK. i don't really understand it.....what was it that people saw in that dreck i didn't see? as a big fan of the original batman films ala Tim Burton and the FIRST film by Joel Schumacher, i remember going into batman begins all starry eyed and excited to see my favorite hero on screen. needless to say, i was let down. i did read in magazines beforehand the 'realism' approach Nolan was taking. i thought OK, it will be dark like Tim Burton's awesome movies, yeah! but.....it was boring. it dragged. the villains were lame. Ra's AL Gaul i mainly knew from the cartoon show with Kevin Conroy i grew up watching. i expected Lazarus pits. didn't get that. the bat mobile looked like a freaking tank. that just ticked me off. I'm still not over that. then came the dark knight. i didn't expect much, given how incredibly lame batman begins was. and i wasn't crazy about the casting of heath ledger as joker. last person in the world i would have cast to play him. ah well, i decided to give it a try, plus the hype was incredible due to ledgers death. it turned out that was the only thing anyone could even remember about the film. its totally unmemorable, and try as i might, i could help but compare ledger to Nicholson. needless to say, ledger doesn't even come close to the genius of jack. the whole look of joker was totally off, looking like a grungy hobo. LAME. while the action is ever so slightly amped up, it never took off for me, and two-face, more like half-a-face, short cameo at the end (yes, thats really all it was) was incredibly insulting. sorry to say, tommy lee Jones still owns that part as he was a major player and played the role to the hilt.now we have the 3rd movie, and boy am i glad its the last. being the batman fan i am, i knew it would suck but i just had to see it to compare it to the others. in retrospect, i would say batman begins is probably the lesser of 3 evils in this series. at least it followed the traditional batman movie feel, more or less, as well as being the only one to have the word 'batman' in the title. i simply do not like going to a batman movie that doesn't have the word batman in the title. 'the dark knight' is just Batman's nickname, not his REAL name. its just pure laziness. they could have easily called the 3rd one 'batman rises'. simple and to the point. dark knight is just stupid sounding. OK now onto the movie. stylistically, Nolan doesn't have a clue how to make a batman movie. did he even watch the previous movies? whatever happened to 'does it come in black?'. now the freaking tank look like army colors! huh? the helicopter looking thing.... THATS supposed to be an updated bat-plane? huh? looks more like the tumbler grew jets engines and learned how to fly. nope, the Tim Burton/Schumacher bat planes are really BATPLANES. they looked like a bat, not this hunk of junk. the whole deal with batman disappearing for 8 years is....not. batman. batman would not just abandon his city for that long. batman is always out there protecting people in Gotham. he wouldn't let some cops or some dogs stop him. totally out of character. bane looks like a mortal combat reject and catwoman..is it even fair to call her that? what did they do to one of my favorite characters *teardrop* *sniff* they didn't even use the name catwoman! so, she could be 'leather clad biker chick' for all we know. for any people or kids who Haven't seen the other films and this is there introduction to the character. i feel bad for them cuz they wont know who it is. the costume is awful, yes even worse and uncatwoman-like then the Halley berry skank version. Michelle pfieffer still owns this part. tragic, dark, sexy and pshycotic on top of being an insanely beautiful woman in the classic grace Kelly mold. Anne Hathaway is a strange looking look duck, and her performance was ultra weak in comparison. even when not comparing to pfieffer, the gold standard of Catwomans, she is still weak. the scene where she dances with bale, when compared with the Keaton/pfieffer scene, shows how superior Tim Burton's films are in just about every way, story wise and artistically. but you cant blame her entirely when you look at the garbage she has to work with. if you watch what pfieffer did with the role, which was pretty damn intense (wrecking apartments in rage, blowing up buildings, killing a guy with a electroshock kiss, getting shot point blank range) there isn't much else you can do with this part. Michelle did it ALL. now bane. despite the mortal combat silly look, i thought he would be more cooler then the B&R bane at the very least. *sigh* once again, lame. the way he breaks Batman's back is stupid, ooh a comics reference! these movies are for the nerds i swear. and cat woman??? kills him? the constant flashbacks, the cheesy dialog, the lack of action *yet again*, killing off Bruce Wayne and showing batman hanging up his cape and cowl for good, is Nolan's last big flip of the bird to the real batman fans who expected more from a modern batman film.",1,14,28,29 July 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The film that made me a Rings Maniac!
","before i saw ROTK in theaters, i had no idea what the big deal was. i remembering seeing the first 2 on VHS years ealier and enjoyed them, but never really GOT into it. however, that all changed when i went with my mom to see ROTK in theaters one day......and i was changed. i cried! i laughed! i felt moments of terror, i FREAKED when frodo fell off the cliff with gollum....only he didn't fall in! it gripped me like no other movie has since! and it instantly made me a fan. now i am a rings maniac, all due to this film. i will admit, fellowship has since become my favorite, but i will never forget the experience of ROTK. the battle scenes were gorgeus and epic, and it was just so GREAT! i waitied for an entire YEAR for the extended version on DVD with baited breath! i read all 3 books that summer (and they were actually like the films were! talk about faithfulness)! the ending made me and my mom cry buckets! stunning, absolutely stunning.",10,1,1,7 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The movie that changed cinema for the better amidst dark 70's garbage
","i wasn't born in the 70's, i wasn't around when this first came out. i was a child of the 90's, and grew up watching these on video tapes and the 1997 special editions. however, that doesn't make a difference, these movies were extremely awesome and still are. i now can enjoy them on my big HDTV on bluray quality. and this is probably my favorite of the 3 original films. but having seen many other movies since i first saw star wars, i must say, i feel bad for kids who grew up in the 70s! i mean, what movies did they have to watch that was for kids? i feel a bi spoiled because i grew up watching the awesome films of the 80's and 90's. but in the 70's, all these movies about twisted anti-heroes, exploitation films and dark and downright disturbing story lines. talk about a dreary era in cinema! Rocky was probably one of the few movies that actually featured a real honest good hero and not some taxi driver deadly gross anti-hero crap.then came Star Wars. the biggest movie not just of the decade, but of all time. it shattered records and was a film kids as well as adults fell in love with, and to no surprise. its not meant to be some deep dark drama about killers and rapists etc, its just a lighthearted action filled adventure that gave moviegoers hope in a decade of real trash cinema (oh excuse me, 'high art' *rolles eyes*). star wars literally saved the world (of cinema) from the depths of some real perverted filmmakers of the time (kubrick, scorsece, etc). families and kids could finally go to a movie and not be affronted with disturbing messages and images. what a relief! and movie's were forever changed. the following year, Superman the movie came out and also was a film families and kids could enjoy, and after that, the awesome 80's came and was a decade that featured some of the best action adventure films in the history of cinema. Indiana Jones, gremlins, all those big Arnold and Stallone films, Batman, back to the future, Ghostbusters, etc. ALL thanks to Star Wars. and the tradition continues to this day. thank you Lucas for saving movies and not letting it get sucked into the black hole of 70's dark twisted cinema.",10,1,2,23 October 2011
Jurassic Park," Great great movie, great actors, great effects, great music, great EVERYTHING!
","I like many saw this as a kid and was so super enthralled. the movie was fun, scary and at times LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. people who only watch this for the special effects must pay attention to the dialog and story. its actually very deep and raises certain questions rely questioned in movies today. this movie for some reason people skip over the acting, but cm on! its got some of the best actors here doing probably there best work. who can forget Jeff goldblum as Ian Malcolm?? this guy was hilarious, almost every bit of dialog he said was brilliantly funny and just his whole unique idiosyncratic personality added so much to the film. no wonder he was cast again in 'the lost world', although he was sadly less funny in that one. then you got Sam Niel as Alan grant, again, brilliant actor who fit his role perfectly and you really believed he was this smart scientist dinosaur guy. he was very down to earth and a very caring rugged type of guy, and also very likable in the main role. laura dern is perhaps the weak spot, at times she kinda annoyed me but yet at the same time, she was very real and her and Sam Neil had great chemistry. however i don't like what they did to them in JP3, it contradicts the ending of JP1, but ah well, i tend to just ignore JP3 ever happened. the kid actors are actually very good, the boy was so cute and funny always following grant around and being the comedy relief, and the girl wasn't bad either. its surprising actually, 2 kid actors that didn't annoy me! how refreshing! and even the small roles like with the fat guy dennis and the small role of samuel l jackson as the computer guy and of course the badass muldoon 'SHOOT HEEER!' were actually really great acting and often times very funny! anyway, almost 20 years later i still remain impressed and this is a film that is not to be missed, and if i ever have kids i look forward to sharing this film with them, thats how much i love this movie!",10,6,8,12 May 2011
