First Man," Brilliance written all over.
","I wasn't expecting much out of a space film after so many films exploring that genre but man this film beats everyone out of the park! Brilliantly made and keeps you edge of the seat through the film. What I really liked it even though it seems like a film about going to the moon, it's such a moving film about the struggles we had trying to achieve it. Yet another feather to Damien's cap.",10,2,8,14 October 2018
