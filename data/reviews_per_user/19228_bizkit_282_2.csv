Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," AWFUL!!!!! This is a disgrace to the other Star Wars movies
","I was so excited when I heard that the new Star Wars movie was coming out. There was so much hype around the movie and people were camping out for the movie, so I said to myself that this was going to be the best Star Wars movie of them all.  When I was a little kid I grew up watching the Star Wars movies and was so thrilled when this one came out.Since alot of my friends were not into Star Wars I went out one afternoon and bought me a ticket.  So I go into the movie theater expecting a wonderful movie, I get a 2 hour suck-fest.  The acting was not bad, but the little kid playing Anakin Skywalker had the brain of a 2 year-old, his acting could not come near to the success of Haley Joel-Osment.   Liam Nesson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman were good in there performances, but they seemed outdone by the over the top special effects.  Samuel L. Jackson is one of my favorite actors, but his role was wasted in this movie. The main thing that I plain out hated in this movie was that Darth Maul is only in about 20 minutes of the film and only has about 2 lines and I thought that Darth Maul was going to be meaner and badder the Darth Vadder. The racing seen made the movie seem like 'Days of Thunder' not Star Wars. But the main thing I hated in this movie was Jar-Jar Binks, ger rid of him George Lucas please.I feel sorry for the die-hard Star Wars fans that I have to write such a hateful review, but I hate to tell you this if your an average person you would of hated it too.  People actually QUIT their jobs for this movie!!!! Were are you people from.",Null,0,1,10 April 2000
X-Men," Finally a comic-book movie that is just as good as the comic itself!!!
","I grew up collecting the X-Men comic books and action figures and watched the cartoon every Saturday morning. I grew out of the routine as I got older, but when I heard that they had made a movie, I was so excited. I couldn't wait to see it.  Well it was worth the long wait, the movie was wonderful. I think it was smart that they didn't put alot of the X-Men in the movie that would just make the story more complicated, and I think anytime you base a movie on a comic don't use alot of the characters or you'll just get a bad movie, perfect example 'Batman & Robin.'  Wolverine is played wonderfully by Hugh Jackman, he is the toughest S.O.B., he's the guy everybody likes. The special effects are wonderful and the movie is just great. In fact I'm going to see it again this week, I liked it so much.  I recommend this movie for anybody, even if you're not a fan , you will get your money's worth in the theater.**** out of ****",10,0,0,15 July 2000
