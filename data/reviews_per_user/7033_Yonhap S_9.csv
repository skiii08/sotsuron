The Blair Witch Project," Not scary, but interesting
","To get into this film, it's better that you understand what the filmmakers were aiming for.  Fortunately, there's no one ramming down my throat hyping the movie.  I've checked the Blair Witch website a little.  It sure has lots of amazing details.Anyway, onto the film itself.  The first half hour of the movie is disorienting what with the shaky handheld cam shots.  But this first half hour is essential to know the Blair Witch myth (wish I listened hard, heheh).  Then the next hour is where the transformation of the kids from happy, to whining annoyance uttering the F word plenty of times, and ultimately fear.I never got scared or made me think hard such as to lose sleep.  What it is, is simply an interesting way of making a movie.  That's it.  The actors don't have much of a script to work with and so most of the scenes are ad libbed.  And the story is constructed as a documentary.  At the end, you feel that you want to know more, but since it's a 'unfinished documentary' the end is naturally abrupt.  This is one story best viewed on a TV screen IMO.The verdict: 3 of 5 stars.",6,0,1,16 April 2000
The 13th Warrior," not so great epic
","This movie isn't completely bad in terms of fx and production design.  In fact, they're impressive, as are the battle scenes and historical setting. I also like the generally positive portrayal of an Arab character.  What brings this movie down is the storytelling.  Few of the 13 warriors were fleshed out.  Antonio Banderas' characteris could have been left out of the story and this movie will still go. As the title suggests, the  story is largely the point of view of Banderas' character, Ahmad.  It doesn't also help that the plot holes and common sense in logistics are very gaping.  The large army of eaters of the dead could have easily overwhelmed the village. The ending is a rather big letdown as I just feel like saying: 'is that all?' And then there's an old woman who talks like as if she's Yoda, so the heroes can conveniently finish their task without having to bother finding out how to defeat the enemy.The verdict: 3 of 5 stars.",Null,0,0,20 November 1999
Elizabeth," incredible
","From the comments here, I was initially afraid this film was going to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey where an overwhelming review is positive with very few negative citing that it was boring.  I'm glad to say ELIZABETH was a great film.  Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush turn in outstanding performances.I think you have to watch at the right mood though.  If you're tired and you watch this you might not like it.  Watch it when you have a lot of energy and listen to the dialogue carefully.The verdict: 5 of 5 stars.",10,0,4,14 September 1999
The Mummy," One of summer 1999's best entries
","This movie is Stephen Sommers' better monster movie.  The other one was DEEP RISING.  The movie is one enjoyable ride and as everyone has pointed out, it plays more like Indiana Jones than a horror movie (it obviously isn't). Like DEEP RISING, Sommers include many elements from previous movies.  The mirage of Hamunaptra reminded me of Indie's passing through the second or third trap in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE.  There's also THE PRINCE OF EGYPT. Sommers injects the same brand of humor and comic relief like his previous movie.  This one is better though, the story is better laid out and the villain has a commanding presence.  The characters are more lively that I enjoyed them quite a bit more than those in the highly anticipated Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace.The verdict: 4 of 5 stars.",8,0,0,12 August 1999
The Little Mermaid," The one that started it all
","I had the opportunity to see this again.  This is said to be the last of Disney's animation to be completely hand drawn.  Watching it now, I could just imagine how the movie would look like had it been made and released today.  Anyway, this movie helped spark Disney's annual full-quality animated feature in the 90's.Anyway, Ariel, the little mermaid, sports the largest eyes I've seen in Disney human heroines.  It seems to me this is the first time Disney used such large eyes on such a character (usually it's anyone but the heroine). The animators make full use of that as a window to her soul.  Though this is nothing new (in Japanese animation), it really brought out her character here.  The songs are very memorable without the benefit of hot artists singing their own versions. I just wish the tv series made more use of Ariel's many sisters.  They didn't serve much purpose here.The verdict: 4.5 of 5 stars.",9,1,2,5 September 1999
The Mummy Returns," not bad, but first movie was better
","Well, this movie is entertaining the first time.  But I got tired watching its second viewing.  I'm surprised no one here mentioned about Evie's distant past and if that were so, Imhotep should have recognized her a lot better in the first movie.I like the first movie better because it had much better character development and interaction.  This sequel is confident of its characters and proceeds as the plot tells them to (which isn't much to begin with).  At 2 hours, the movie is too long for what is a no-brainer adventure film.rating: 2.5 of 5 stars",5,0,0,15 June 2001
Toy Story 2," Easily one of the best
","What else can I say about Toy Story 2?  It touches upon our inner child, tells a wacky, funny, yet touching story.  The inclusion of Barbie was pretty neat and a great victory for Pixar.  I kind of felt that Transformers (the great toyline of the 80's) would be awesome to include albeit innappropriate (that's why there's Beast Wars).There's more pop culture reference such as Star Wars, Jurassic Park and Godzilla (which was used plenty of times).  I still like the first movie better, but as sequels go, this is truly excellent.The verdict: 5 of 5 stars.",10,0,1,7 February 2000
The Sixth Sense," Awesome movie with a jaw-dropping finale
","Wow.  That's what I can say about this movie.  The only other movie I can remember with a surprise twist was The Usual Suspects.  I had trouble following that film's twist and turns in the plot.  The Sixth Sense goes with simple-fashioned storytelling.  No big sidetracks to the story and just follow the characters from beginning to end.  It's hard to describe what I think of the film's major plot points without in effect dropping hints.  All I can say is the mood isn't so scary, although it is creepy.  But it would be surprising if this film at least won't be nominated in the Oscars for Best Screenplay.The verdict: 5 of 5 stars.  This is the best film I've seen so far this year.",10,0,0,11 November 1999
Tarzan," Awesome and excellent
","Tarzan is another classic for Disney's annual release of animated features. Disney's new animation technology, Deep Canvass, shows that there's still plenty of technology to explore in this kind of animation. The story is entertaining and moving.  Although predictable and simple, we are drawn to the story.  It seems like Disney pulled some punches to the story though, as if held back for the convenience of moving the plot.  One critic in my country pointed the ease with which Tarzan's origin was told. Nevertheless, this 'holding back' doesn't stop me from describing this movie as excellent. The only element that I really didn't like was Jane's father who's somehow for convenience sake is made like a buffoon.  Rosie O' Donnel's performance as Terk was natural but Mr. Porter was simply unlikely for a researcher. The verdict: 4.5 of 5 stars.",9,2,2,14 August 1999
