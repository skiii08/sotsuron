Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great film for normal audience, but a disappointment for fans!
","It is very difficult to give a vote for the new Star Wars movie, because the German synchro is a disaster. But I would say the prequel installment is a great and thrilling movie, when you aren´t a Star Wars fan. The new film doesn´t have the old character like episode 4 till 6 and this is the reason why some Star Wars fans are very disappointed of Episode 1. But something is so genial, that everybody have to say, 'this is a optical miracle'. That are the special effects of ILM. I´m not a great fan of this franchise, and I give this vote for the film: **** (******) Sisko",6,0,1,20 August 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Everybody is excellent in this movie
","'Shakespeare in Love' is a well done movie with great actors and actress, but I would never give Judi Dench an Academy Award. Judi Dench played very well, however I would not give an Academy Award for playing only 7 minutes. That´s my point of view. Moreover the sets of Shakespeare in Love are breathtaking and the costumes are beautiful. But the most important thing is, that Shakespeare in Love got the OSCAR FOR THE BEST MOVIE. It´s a great movie, you have to watch it.",5,0,3,2 April 1999
American History X," Very serious topic
","American History X is a movie, which you can´t like, because the topic is so serious and you are very sad about the end of the movie. However the film is thrilling and E. Norton plays his role brilliant. The other actors also bring their talent on screen. You can watch the actors´ and actress´ courage in order to make a great movie with a story about a man with different ideals. If you have the chance to watch this movie, do it !!!",8,0,0,24 April 1999
There's Something About Mary," It was very crazy
","This is the most crazy movie which I have ever seen. The main actors (Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon) were the most important keepers of this movie.",9,1,1,5 November 1998
The Truman Show," An opponent for Saving Private Ryan
","This film has a very good chance to win the famous Academy Award for the best movie. I think this film is a possibility to see like huge the power of the television is. Of course, the story is too unrealistic, however you watch some very important facts of the television, which are included in our TV programme. For example 'commercials'. Ed Harris plays his role so realistically, that I think he owns a TV station or he´s a producer. In the movie he fells like a god over a small world. He is ruling over this small town and its inhabitants. If you want watch a very funny and intellectual movie, THE TRUMAN SHOW is the best movie for a long time.",8,0,0,15 November 1998
The Thin Red Line," The topic is serious, but the movie is a joke
","An advice from me: 'Please don´t watch this movie, you will be disappointed'. There are too many main actors, you will have a problem to distinguish the main characters in Malick´s war. I don´t understand the title of this movie and the bad attempt to show the brutality of war in this kind like in this film. Moreover the movie is too long and the contents too less. However I have to say the cinematography is beautiful and the landscape breathtaking, but this is too less in order to make a thrilling movie with a serious background.",3,1,2,4 April 1999
