3:10 to Yuma," No too believable
","The acting was great, the direction was okay, but the screenplay was just too unrealistic. The men transporting Wade put themselves at risk so many times, that they DESERVED to die, they were blundering idiots, at best. Would McElroy, who knew what kind of vicious psychopath Wade was, actually been stupid enough to be so close to Wade as to where he could be jumped? If he was, he wouldn't have lived as long as he did.Ben Wade was a blood-thirsty killer plain and simple. Being exposed to 'morality' for a day or two is NOT going to change this type of animal whether it's the Old West or modern day. The last thirty minutes of the picture is ridiculous; Wade actually HELPING Evans take him to the train depot, Evans taking half dozen .45 slugs and NOT being killed outright, Wade turning on his comrades and then turning himself in.I love westerns, but if you want to view a REAL western that hasn't been watered down by a liberal, feel good Tinseltown, watch 'Tombstone', 'Unforgiven' or even 'Blazing Saddles'!",6,5,7,8 February 2008
Crash," Very dated stereotypes...
","This film was horribly heavy-handed with plenty of the typical old-fashioned stereotypes to go around. Many directors believe situations and characters have to be played and portrayed off of the scale to get their agenda across to the audience. This is a perfect example. This film would have been much more realistic and believable had it been set in any time period before the 1970s. Ideally, this would have made a great film to have been set in the 1960s or the '50s. With the talent and performances in this picture, I would have then rated it an easy 8 or maybe a 9. But, because of the director's treatment of racism, it was hard to swallow as legitimate just because it was way over the top. Sure, there are still race and class bigots and issues out there, but they are a little more subdued in this day and age due to a cultural zero tolerance attitude towards racism. This is one of those films where I hear the usual 'could have been much better' ringing in my ears. Great acting, good screenplay, mediocre (at best) direction. Too bad. Chalk this up as ANOTHER undeserving Oscar winner, and there have been a few in the last twenty years. Not that an Academy Award means anything anyway!",5,3,7,1 December 2007
Transformers," Action, yes. Plot, no.
","As of the time of this review, Transformers has a 7.7 rating on this site. I would give it a definite 8 for the special effects, but it just so happens that I rate pictures for the strength of the storyline as well. For that, I give a 2. This is an excellent film for the prepubescent and adolescent boys; non-stop military and machine action! Did I mention it was non-stop? Any adult with attention deficit disorder should also like it, it may very well be the first film that is a distraction to itself. Mind-boggling computer animation built around a two and a half hour commercial for General Motors products might work better in the typical thirty second format. If Transformers hadn't been based on a toy, I would have guessed by the product placement that GMC had bank-rolled this project. Great film for kids, a total yawner for the adult viewer with discerning taste in cinema.",4,0,2,8 December 2007
