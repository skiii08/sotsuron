The Rock," DON'T BE TOO HARD ON THE ROCK
","If you want an entertaining movie, 'The Rock' will do. Sean Connery plays a James Bond character, and Nicolas Cage gives his usual performance. The setting is great and San Francisco is a nice back drop. I did have a few problems with the film. In the age of Ebay, Cage's character buys the Beatles 'White Album' for way too much. The Ed Harris character really cops out when he and his men decide to launch a missle. They take hostages, kill several people, and risk all to see their demands met. When the opportunity arises, they bluff and do not carry out their threats. If they were not prepared to pull the trigger, why go to the extreme in the first place? Nicolas Cage also has a bad acting habit of emphasising the last word of every sentence. He does that in about every movie. Lose that, Cage. This is not a great movie, but don't be too hard on 'The Rock'.  There are enough standard car chases, explosions, and mayhem to keep me entertained.",8,2,2,26 November 2002
The Blair Witch Project," SO BAD, IT'S SCARY
","This is the worst waste of film I have ever witnessed in my life. I cannot fathom what people who loved this movie are thinking. WOW! The 'actors' seem to be talking off the cuff, the script- if there was one, lacked any imagination or anything clever to say.  Movies that have parodied this crappy movie do a better job of conveying fear. I understand the premise, of course. Make the movie appear like a home movie where some young people encounter some weird and horrific experiences. The problem is, most vacation home movies are more compelling and clever. Whenever there was a hint of tension, the actor would swear or scream, for lack of anything better they could think of. This film experience was memorable to me and those who watched it with me, for one reason. It is easily the worst I have ever seen. It makes 'Freddie Got Fingered' look like 'Gone With The Wind'- which is where 'Blair Witch project' should go.",1,34,56,7 November 2002
Ali," WILL SMITH SHOWS HE'S A LIGHTWEIGHT PLAYING ALI
","I consider Muhammed Ali to be the greatest fighter of all time, and one of the greatest entertainers also. This movie, and Will Smith, fall short of expanding the legend of Ali. Maybe Ali was just too big to truly capture. First of all, the fight scenes must have been choreographed by the same guy who did the Rocky movies, or maybe the old Batman TV shows. Every punch connected hard, with a audible thud! And was it necessary to show the bedroom scenes? Yes, they wanted to show the complete picture, but somethings are better left to the imagination. Will Smith would have been better playing Ali without a script and reacting. Instead tries to act like Ali, and proves he is a lightweight. John Voight did a better Cosell than Will Smith does Ali. Ali was about struggle and proving things. It was about his relationship with Smokin Joe Frazier, and the media and Cosell. Watch the real Ali on old shows like the Joe Namath show, or Wide World of Sports. He was articulate and at various times, intense, playful and a master of communication. This movie falls short and loses by a TKO.",3,3,6,10 November 2002
12 Angry Men," NO SPECIAL EFFECTS, JUST SPECIAL ACTING
","I love watching movies from 1957. Beside the fact that this was the year I was born, there were some great movies from that year. 'Bridge on the River Kwai' is one and '12 Angry Men' is another. No special effects, no lavish sets, no tropical backdrops. '12 Angry Men' depends on real acting and intellegence for success. A open and shut case brought to the jury room for quick debate, is set in a stark, black and white setting. Most of the movie takes place in a small, plain room, with no air conditioning. Not exactly the formula for a entertaining movie. But the cast, led by Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobb, bring color and intensity to the screen. Unlike so many movies of today, filled with physical violence and explosions, this movie is filled with verbal sparring and explosions from within the heart. Watching the movie, I felt like I was closed in that small room with the jurors. The movie has the feel of being shot in a couple of hours, instead of the weeks it actually took. This is remarkable because the scenes seem seemless. The movie was a bomb in 1957, but compared to today's formula of sex, aggresion and rock and roll, '12 Angry Men' is a blast from the past. It is 'the bomb!'",10,0,1,5 November 2002
Home Alone," Holiday Movie With the Usual Touch of Violence And Christmas Cheer
","This movie is part of our staple of movies to watch at Christmas time. It is a OK movie, with enough holiday themes and scenery to keep me satisfied it is a holiday movie. McCauley Culkin does a good job playing off two bumbling, and really dumb burglars. It helps to have a mansion as the backdrop to foiling Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.  Some of the scenes where the 2 bumbling burglars try to eneter the house are charmingly funny. It is annoying that the script could not come up more clever ways for Pesci and Stern to react other than 'Ow!' or 'frism-frasm'. And the kid delivers enough hits that would kill a normal person. But today's movies must add violence as one of the ingredients to a successful movie. Audiences have developed a 'taste' for it, even if this was made to be a holiday movie to be seen by millions of kids. But, I did enjoy the Christmas touches and the various personality conflicts from the large family. Home Alone 2 is the companion movie of part 1 and follows the same pattern.",7,0,1,10 November 2002
Forrest Gump," This is a special movie
","I always feel I am watching something magical when I watch 'Forest Gump'. It is more than Tom Hanks amazing performance. It is the script, the special effects, the supporting cast and the great movie score and music of the film. Maybe we need people like Forest Gump in the world. My only regret is that this movie came out the same year as another classic, 'The Shawshank Redemption'. That is my only regret- that 'Forest Gump' took most of the major awards at the Academy Awards that year. Both deserved Best picture and both are gifts to the world of entertainment.",9,1,2,10 April 2002
Forrest Gump," HIS STORY LEADS TO HISTORY
","Forest Gump is more than a movie. It is a documentary on the 1960's and 1970's. It is well directed, well scripted and well acted. The special effects were ground-breaking at the time. The musical soundtrack and movie score also were a perfect match to the various scenes in the movie.  Each song was a perfect match for the visuals on screen. Tom Hanks became Forest Gump. It was not so much that Gump made history or that he followed history as much as he followed his destiny.  His story became history. Reading history books, I have often wished I could be at some historic moment in time. Of course, when you force a situation, you never find history. It's is when you become like Forest Gump, genuine and as a little child, that life becomes memorable. It is this 'be who you are' attitude that drives 'Forest Gump'. This is not to say that this movie doesn't have its' faults. The Robin Wright character has a tortuous and torturous connection with Forest Gump. Forest never gave up his love for her, although maybe he should have. Again, destiny brings them together. The same could be said for the Gary Sinese character and Forest Gump. Fate brought them together, destiny kept them together. It is the combination of great direction and Tom Hanks that keeps the movie together.",9,0,3,5 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I SAW IT ONCE AND I'LL WASTE NO TIME WATCHING IT AGAIN
","I watched (or should I say endured) this movie with several friends and family. We kept waiting for something MEANINGFUL to occur. We just never 'got' it. I don't want to get the Nile virus either. It is obvious that it doesn't take much for some people to be entertained. What a boring, dark, over-blown movie. Do not operate heavy machinery while viewing this movie- excuse me, film. After all the hype, I couldn't wait to see 'Lord of the Rings', and I'll waste no time seeing it again.",1,2,8,12 November 2002
Cast Away," A Creative Ending is Cast Away
","Tom Hanks talks to a volleyball on a deserted tropical island. He remembers his boy scout skills to start a fire. He developes a taste for raw fish, and becomes quite a tailor, seamstress and boat maker. It sounds like outlandish stuff, but Hanks makes it work for me, at least while he is on that island. The movie loses steam, and some creative writing once he gets back to the mainland. It is almost like one person wrote the screenplay on the island, and someone else wrote the screenplay when he is rescued. I followed the plot while he was on the island all alone. I expectantly hoped as he found ways to cope, survive and win against all odds.  Back home again, people seemed harsher than the sea and its creatures. The final scene, in particular was really disappointing and a cop-out. As I viewed the final scene, I thought, 'They get the Hanks character all the way to this junction, and this is all they could think of?' It was a uncreative finish to a imaginative movie.",8,0,0,29 October 2002
The Patriot," A MOVIE EVERY REVOLUTIONARY WAR STUDENT SHOULD SEE
","I didn't expect much when I first watched this movie. I really didn't think a movie set in Revolutionary times would be that entertaining. I left the theatre impressed. The producers obviously put much time and effort into costume design and script detail. Mel Gibson is great, and this was the first I had seen Heath Ledger, who was excellent as Gibson's son. Jason Isaacs is heinous as the British commander. He brought out feelings of anger, which must mean he did a great job. I'm not sure the British were as brutal as portrayed in the movie, but this is a war movie, albeit, Revolutionary War times. Tom Wilkenson is perfect as General Cornwallis, and the supporting cast added to the movie's quality. Every young student studying the early history of America would benefit from watching 'The Patriot'.  It would bring the pages of the history books alive. The battle scenes were gripping and harsh, contrasted by the gentle country side views. I am still amazed how a young, upstart nation defeated a force like Great Britain. Of course, the red coats in file formation made great targets. That had to be a great sight to see for the American sharp shooter, as was this movie for me.",9,1,4,8 November 2002
Face_Off," A MOVIE WITH 'IN YOUR FACE' ACTION
","John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are at their best in this unigue, action thriller. It is interesting to see them play one role, then to see their roles do a 'about face'. The special effects are superb in the scene where the faces of Travolta and Cage are exchanged. It is a scene where you probably don't want to be sitting down to the enjoy a meal while viewing.  I had only one problem with the movie. The casting is well done, save for one exception. Joan Allen as Travolta's wife was not a good fit. Her tight hairdo, and prudish manner made her a better cast as his mother or grandmother. Otherwise, the action and twists in the movie made it a positive experience. My 3 sons, of course, loved the excess barrage of gun fire and explosions. This movie probably is better suitted for the teen and young male audience.",8,0,0,11 November 2002
The Princess Bride," A SLEEPER HIT
","We were pleasantly surprised with 'The Princess Bride'. This is a very cleverly written movie. Also, it is obvious that the direction and acting had to be cleverly and skillfully done. The actors do not 'try' to be funny. They trust the script. Actors who try to ham it up, even with a funny script (Milton Berle, for example), water down the humor of the scene. I found myself chuckling at many lines and situations. The casting is wonderful, and the cast and direction of Rob Reiner make the time period work. This production took some risks, but the gutsy move pays off with a definite sleeper hit.",7,3,6,18 November 2002
JFK," BUY THE VIDEO AND FAST FORWARD TO THE GOOD STUFF
","Being someone who admired JFK, and as a student of November 22, 1963, I looked forward to this movie with great anticipation. I left the theatre in 1992 with mixed reviews of the movie. Kevin Costner's Cajun accent is very annoying, and I was not impressed with his performance. Some of the scenes are ridiculous, or just plain stupid. There are shots of Costner (as Jim Garrison) sitting at the dinner table, spoon feeding the family dog. Bedroom shots of Costner and Sissy Spacek passionately kissing in bed, then discussing Oswald's marine career.  There is a unnecessary scene with Joe Pecsi, Kevin Bacon and Tommy Lee Jones. They are having gay romp, which absolutely detracts from the movie. There were so many other ideas they could have incorporated. I thought the scenes which dealt with the events in Dealey Plaza were compelling. It showed different views, angles and eyewitness accounts. I felt Oliver Stone was fair in his attempt to give different viewpoints and opinions. It was when the film diverted to events outside of Dealy Plaza that Oliver Stone failed. Since I now own this movie on video, I have the benefit of fast forwarding PAST THE FLUFF to the good stuff. The autposy scenes have a authentic look to them and are compelling to watch. Some of the scenes are shot very fast, and you have to be a historian to know which were the actual photographs from that day, and which were re-shot for the movie. In the final analysis, I believe Oswald acted alone. And I believe this movie could have been alot better if they had not tried to introduce unrelated items into it. Introduce new evidence, yes. Keep Hollywood bedroom scenes for another movie.",6,5,20,13 November 2002
Black Hawk Down," BLACK HAWK AND THUMBS DOWN
","If you like an endless barrage of bullets, explosions and bullets and bombings, than this is the movie for you. Sitting through it for over 2 hours adds up to a boring movie experience. If I want to watch that much gun action, I'll watch Vietnam documentaries. Even the documentaries show some bright scenery and variety once in a while. This snorer was one long burst of machine gun vollies. I expected alot of gun play, but this was every scene. At least put some variety into the various explosions and machine gun fire. Give some scenes with some dialgue, even if it isn't clever. I'm sure most people, especially the younger audience, thought the combat scenes were action packed. Every one is entitled to their opinion, but the theatre group I left with found this movie very boring. I give Black Hawk Down a big thumbs down.",1,4,13,11 November 2002
The Fly," A GUY, A GIRL AND A FLY: A LOVE TRIANGLE
","This is probably Jeff Goldblum's most compelling role. He got into shape, and had the major role.  This film was well done, and fluctuated between a love story, a science fiction movie and a horror story. I found this idea of transportation interesting. The movie is off-beat, but entertaining and well done. It's somethimes refreshing to see a script that is clever and goes off the beaten path of other cookie cutter Hollywood productions. Gina Davis seems to gravitate towards these kinds of roles. It makes you look at the fly at a different angle, especially when they are preparing to eat something (like a donut).",8,1,2,14 November 2002
Titanic," Big Expectations, But The Movie Delivers
","I was skeptical when I first went to see the movie with my wife. I had heard it was a 'chick-flick', and that the director had incorporated fictional characters into the real life drama. I was pleasantly surprised when I left the theatre. The movie delivered a compelling and factual account of the disaster, intertwined with the fictional main characters. Jack and Rose were important to the movie. They really told the story of so many of the actual Titanic victims who remain unknown to this day.Close to 1500 souls went down with the ship. The movie helped me to see their struggle to survive, and what were the shocking effects of hitting the iceberg. The tragedy at the World Trade Center certainly correlates with the Titanic disaster for modern times. This movie has piqued my interest so much that I viewed the Titanic exhibit when it came to Cleveland in 2002.",10,0,3,8 April 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," IT'S NOT OFFICIALLY CHRISTMAS SEASON UNTIL I WATCH THIS MOVIE
","I am so glad Frank Capra had a vision to make 'It's A Wonderful Life'. I'm glad he chose Jimmy Stewart to play George Bailey. There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of 'It's A Wonderful Life' still hold true today. Yes, I'll say it, it's a wonderful movie.",10,174,207,5 November 2002
A Beautiful Mind," What Is Beautiful About This Movie?
","I am not going to jump on this band wagon. What a boring movie. I kept thinking during the opening scenes that something was going to happen. I guess I fell asleep and missed the movie magic. What a bore. And from what I've read, the movie and the real life story are not even closely resembled.The characters are dull, the script goes nowhere. Reading all the comments from people blathering about the greatness of this slow motion picture, I would love to hear from real men what they think. But, to each his own. This movie was trying to be art, but so was 'Vanilla Sky'. It was another borefest in the same vein. This movie really brought out the weaknesses in Russell Crowe's acting.",1,13,27,26 October 2004
A Beautiful Mind," WAKE ME UP WHEN IT'S OVER
","Boring direction, boring characters, boring story. Yes, I know the ending is shocking, but I couldn't tolerate staying with it to the end. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I respected Ron Howard's work- until I had to sit through  his destruction of 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas'. Now this ugly waste of time.",1,3,11,16 March 2003
Die Hard," I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY LIKE THIS
","John Mclain (Bruce Willis) flies to LA to see his estanged wife. He meets her at the office Christmas party in a high rise building. But wait, there's more! Terrorists take over the building, but the Willis character ruins their holiday cheer. The premise of 1 good guy vs several bad guys seems far-fetched on paper. But they pull it off. This movie is entertaining. John Mclain doesn't appear super human or invincible as he mows down each terrorist one by one. He shows enough fear and trepidation to make each scene believeable. The director also uses a mix of drama, comedy and suspense to keep the movie rolling. Two hours of guns blazing, bombs exploding and profanity would have been too tedious. The Christmas setting is also a nice touch. This is a guy flick, so it's not for everybody. But if you want a holiday movie full of light hearted trash-talking, explosions and greed, this is the movie for you.",10,1,1,8 November 2002
A Hard Day's Night," WHY THEY CALLED IT BEATLEMANIA
","Yes, the acting is pretty cheeky, but it's the music that makes this black and white film so memorable. The Beatles are in the heyday. They come across on the screen as very charming and charismatic. But it is when they pick up their guitars that the artistry and talent really shine through. They were entertainers, not necessarily good actors. Ringo does show some promise as he did not seem as self conscience as John, Paul or George. This was Beatlemania, put together in a documentary format by Richard Lester. The movie being in black and white doesn't hurt either, as it gives the film a timeless feel. In an age before there were rock and roll videos, it is great to have this recorded piece of history on a group that became a phenomenon.",8,1,1,13 November 2002
Con Air," THERE'S ONLY 2 PEOPLE I TRUST; ONE'S ME- THE OTHER'S NOT YOU
","For action and entertainment, not too many movies each year deliver.  'Con Air' is entertaining, which is one thing I expect a movie to do.  Nick Cage and John Malkovich lead the way with catchy one liners and light-hearted drama.  John Cusack also delivers a solid performance, and there is enough action and little twists to keep me interested for the entire movie.  The dialogue is simple, yet clever throughout.  One scene typifies the movie. Cage's character sees the plane he is on with a sports car accidentally hooked to the plane.  He says rather calmly, 'any other day, that might seem strange...'  The ending is over the top with explosions and mayhem, which detracts a little from the entire movie.  The director definately wanted Malkovich's character dead, and he over killed him. But, definately a entertaining movie.",9,0,0,19 October 2002
Con Air," AN ENTERTAINING 2 HOURS WITH PROS AND CONS
","There are pros and cons in this movie. It was entertaining all the way through, and that is what movies are intended for. Headlined by Nicholas Cage and John Malkovich, and John Cusack, the action and dialogue make it one of the best movies of the year 1997. Some of the one liners, especially by Cage are funny and memorable. You would think that Malkovich is miscast as a prisoner, but he lowers himself into a believeable role. I never get tired of watching the movie, because it goes from action to comedy to drama with ease.",9,0,0,25 April 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," BAD TITLE, GREAT FILM
","'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of my favorite films. It was filmed in and around where I live (in Ohio), and I have actually visited the old prison where they shot much of the movie. I would love to know where they filmed the scene where Andy buried the letter and money in that countryside. It looks very familiar.  Anyway, I thought Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were at their best, and had great chemistry together. The casting, so important to making a film work, was well done.  Bob Gunton ,as the warden, does a great job. There is something intriging about escaping from a hopeless situation and changing your destiny. This is the first Steven King work I have actually enjoyed. Also, the background music really adds to the overall enjoyment and quality of the film. I am glad to see it is also considered one of the greatest films of all times by others.",10,0,0,11 November 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Bad Title, Truly Great Film
","When I first watched 'The Shawshank Redeption', I thought it was a O-K movie. Something in the characters and the motion picture score would draw me back to see the movie again. Now, it is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is a classic. The story, adapted from a Steven King novel, stays true to the book. To me, there is something intriguing about a person changing his destiny, especially against all hope. The casting of the key players in the movie are right on target, and Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins work very well together. So, when you get a great script, talented actors cast properly, and a movie score that captures the mood and drama of the scene, it makes for a memorable movie.",10,0,0,8 April 2002
Halloween," The Original Scary Movie
","'Halloween' has become a seasonal tradition at our house. It isn't halloween season until my family and I settle on the couch, turn off the lights and watch 'Halloween' and its' sister movie 'Halloween II'. I realize that many people think this is a really bad movie, and maybe that's the charm of 'Halloween'. We love the bad acting, the campy background music, and the silly scenes. This is the original slasher movie, and Hollywood has never been able to duplicate it. Jaime Lee Curtis seems naive and fresh, and I get shivers watching Michael Myers slowly hunt people with that big knife.",10,0,0,29 April 2002
Back to the Future Part II," IS IT BACK TO THE FUTURE OR AHEAD TO THE PAST?
","I was somewhat disappointed with  'Back To The Future, Part 2' because of the producer/director's vision of the future. Marty McFly (Micheal J Fox) lives in a sinister, darker world in the 21st Century. Marty has been reduced to a fumbling, bumbling idiot. What happened to the clever, thinks fast on his feet Marty Mcfly?  Biff was a bully for sure in the 1950's. He becomes ugly and too over the top evil in part 2.  Doc Brown is the only main character who stays pretty much the same. Sure, change is refreshing and needed, but the script takes the characters too far. Part 1 has many classic scenes that become iconic. The clever writing is history in part 2. It was also confusing at times to follow the back and forth time travel. Marty and Doc go back to 1955 again, but they have to be careful not to meet Marty and Doc from 1985, who went back to 1955 originally. Also, old Biff goes back to 1955 to talk to young Biff. Marty and Doc have to be careful not to be spotted by young Biff, or old Biff, and old Biff must return to the 21st Century before he is 'caught' by Marty and Doc- who are in the future to see old Marty and Doc. WHEW!! Just a little bit too twisted and too busy. They gave it a nice try, but one classic is all this trilogy had in it. 'Back To The Future' , part 1 was ahead of its' time. When part 2 finished I thought, 'it's about time'.",7,0,1,8 November 2002
Apollo 13," MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED IT'APOLLO BAKER'S DOZEN'
","Most movies I have watched that are based on a true story are disappointing. Not so with 'Apollo 13'. Tom Hanks kept his streak alive in 1995 of another great splashdown, and Ron Howard proved that he can do great work. I turned 13 on Friday the 13th, in 1970 when this event actually occurred. Even though I knew the story of Apollo 13, and had watched many documentaries on the subject, this movie found ways to keep me interested. Failure was not an option. I thought the movie was well cast. When the capsule finally did splash down, I joined in the cheering. Thirteen proved to be a lucky number for this movie.",9,0,1,8 November 2002
The Wizard of Oz," VIEW IT AS AN ADULT, VISUALIZE IT AS A CHILD
","I first watched 'The Wizard of Oz' as a child. It was memorable for many reasons. The songs, the cartoon quality of the characters, and the colorful story and sets made it a life experience I remember to this day. Most vivid to me as a child of 7-8 was how scared I was of the Wicked Witch of the West.  I have seen this film many times since, and have enjoyed it with my siblings and my wife and children also. It is truly one of the great films of all time. In fact, it was ahead of its time. I am surprised it is only #52 on the list of greatest American films. It is part of our DNA, as virtually every American has seen this film.  Judy Garland, Ray Bulger, and Jack Haley are marvelous together, and the the supporting cast very memorable.  What other movie has munchkins?  The songs are very catchy, and 'Over The Rainbow' is one of the great songs of the 20th Century. The theme of the film is to get 'home' and the importance of helping others. In the age we live in, maybe every adult should watch 'The Wizard of Oz' again, and watch it with the eyes of a child.",10,5,6,11 November 2002
