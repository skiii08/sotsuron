Iron Man 3," OK... I was mistaken
","The first movie was a success. Boys (and grown boys) from everyplace loves the Iron Man. The second was good too; Mr. Downey Jr. always fun, an impeccable Tony Stark one more time.

Script is the answer. The contrasts between the movies and the comics aren't news to anybody... but, this time it was unforgivable. Unforgivable they does with Mandarin.

We have Tim Burton. We have Danny Elfman's Ice Dance. We have Dianne Wiest and Alan Arkin...oh my God... We have Vincent Price!! Everything is perfect.Depp? OK OK ... we have Depp too. ...",10,1,1,25 February 2016
