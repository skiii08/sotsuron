Mission: Impossible III," Worst movie ever
","Worst movie ever, what else can I say? TC has spoiled and destroyed his good name out there in the movie biz.Personally, he needs to apologize to the mentally challenged people. That's what it would take for me to even look at him again.It was horribly sloppily made.The script needed reworking in the worst way. I have never seen such a bad movie since M Night Shymalan's The Village and that was horrendous. Hardly any plot.Redstone was right to axe Tom; it's all going for broke on action and hoping fans wouldn't notice the horribly thin storyline that just barely held the movie together. Cruise is not capable of pullng off a convincing acting job; they should have replaced him with someone new, younger, and fresh.",1,1,4,27 March 2007
Sleepy Hollow," Good movie
","I love this movie! Edge of your seat and keep you guessing who did it until the end. Tim Burton adds a great touch with Crane's mother, keeping Crane real and showing us why Crane became the way that he did.The flashbacks add a real sense of mystique, offering us deeper insight into Ichabod Crane. It is nice to see that after conducting an autopsy and seeing his opponent in action at night, that Crane is still afraid of everyday things like spiders! Wonderfully acted, sends chills down the spine for a continual ride through the woods! Christopher Walken portrayed an excellent headless horseman. The CG effects were nicely done as well.",8,1,2,27 March 2006
The Village," Worst ever
","This was the worst 'horror' movie ever! It was completely disorganized, no structure at all! There was no plot to speak of, it seemed like it was just focusing on the kids and not at all what they were afraid of.Really, there was no surprises on this movie, it was simply awful to watch. The lead girl was the only substance in the film, she was a round character, not static like the rest. It was so obvious even from the beginning who did this and that..I geared up for a nice thrill and I got a lukewarm so called 'horror' movie that made pretty much no sense whatsoever. It is a horrendous movie with little to no horror in it at all.",1,10,20,27 March 2006
