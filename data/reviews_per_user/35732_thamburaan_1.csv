Frost_Nixon," A WOW - which created in 38 days.
","A perfect gathering of unbeatable artists who can make a role forever remembered. This film really makes a true bid to the actual events which happened. Even though its a full reel of conversations and emotional drama, I enjoyed this through out. Always Ron Howrad has been amazing in creating films which has huge acting output. Like A beautiful mind, Da vinci code etc. Like those this is one of his finest product. The major attraction of this movie taken away by Frank Langella & Micheal Sheen, I really admire Frank Langella's acting in this, its so emotional and real. As the character goes by the exact emotional reflections can be taken out from his face. Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and every other cast did their part very well, in the matter of acting the movie goes up in the air for the dedication8 out of 10",8,1,1,18 March 2016
