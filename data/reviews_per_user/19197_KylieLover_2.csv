Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The bitch is back!
","Nothing about Vol One can compare to the less violence that brings the Vol Two. All of the actors are fierce: Where in the world was Daryl Hannah!? She did an extraordinary job, Oscar-worthy. Don't let me start with David Carradine, who was marvelous. And The Bride herself... God, Uma gets better over the years. She knows with who she should work, and that's why she's working with Quentin. A brilliant genius who knows how to jump from genre to genre, from the greatest catfight to the softest moment between a mom and her daughter.This should teach em how a movie should be make.",10,2,4,28 September 2005
Spice World," 'Sunday drivers, and it's only Saturday...'
","This movie has got better with yea-ts for me. I was a huge fan of the girls back then, and at first I thought this movie was stupid. But know that I've re-watched it, all I can say is that gets better. The line I'm using as summary is just an ace line from the only Spice that brings a good performance: Victoria. Don't know if she's playing herself and she just cartoonize herself even more. She has the best lines and she knows how to bring em.The stupid situations are getting better. Nothing compares with the scene when they are in the country house and start to talk about they nightmares. Or when they see themselves as moms. They had really good charm.",8,1,2,27 September 2005
