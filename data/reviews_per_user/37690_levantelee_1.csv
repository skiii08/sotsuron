The Avengers," Movie of the year for me
","'Warning, this review may contain spoilers'. The Avengers was definitely worth a wait. I enjoyed every second of it, and Iron Man played an important part in the whole film. And he was also my favorite superhero. This movie was so special in 5 ways: 1. The Anticipation. 2. The Trailers. 3. The Cast. 4. The Villains. 5. The HULK. The Hulk was a COMPLETE MONSTER in the movie and I was glad he fought Thor. But, the assets( Black Widow and Hawkeye)did a PHENOMENAL job in their part of the movie. Scarlett Johansson was amazing. Thor was more aggressive in this movie than in his own movie. Oh, THOR vs Iron Man was my favorite fight scene. Captain America played a good role in the film. Loki was lethal and unpredictable in the movie. I was laughing so hard when Hulk smashed Loki into the floor. When I seen the movie, the day it came out May 4th 2012, every single person in the audience was laughing so hard. In the post-credits scene I was so surprised to see THANOS. I knew their was going to be something after the credits and I'm going to do that every time I see a marvel movie. BTW, I'm glad they showed Thanos in the post-credits scene. Phenomenal movie, go see it ASAP.",10,7,15,10 May 2012
