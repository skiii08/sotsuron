10 Cloverfield Lane," How disappointing...
","The pitch was promising, with a thriller in huis-clos, a post-apocalyptic scenery and suspicious characters. However the movie wasn't really up to expectations. The first hour of the movie is really intriguing and breathtaking. You wonder what happened out there and if they will ever be able to live once again on the Earth. All characters are very interesting, with different back-stories on how they ended up in the bunker. After that, the heroin manage to escape the bunker (yeah it is an American movie so she cannot just die), and everything starts to become completely f***ed up. Futuristic-ish aeroplanes, unidentifiable alien creature coming out of nowhere, a pseudo-war of the human against God-knows who, an ending very disappointing. Yeah, the last part of this movie is a bunch of everything that makes a good movie become a real crap, not even the tension built up during the first hour can resist this nonsense in the story and characters. To sum-up : they should have stopped the movie after one hour...",3,1,2,17 July 2016
