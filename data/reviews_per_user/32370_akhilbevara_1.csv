The Avengers," The Avengers blow u away
","I am not really a fan of movies with too many big characters, but this one i have to say is a truly awesome movie. Its starts off with a bang with Loki making a nice appearance and just carries on from there. The best part of the film comes in its last 1 hour. The actions sequences, the graphics and the spot comedy by the actors is superb. True credit to the director for making enough screen space for all the characters who have performed brilliantly. Special mention about Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.)and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), outstanding performance by both of them. Now coming to the storyline, its simple. Loki wants to conquer earth and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team 'The Avengers' to stop the invasion. All the characters have their own special part to play in the film n they carried it out flawlessly. As i said before, the special feature of this film is its action sequences. I was amazed by the way they were pictured. Really an outstanding job. And also the spot comedy, especially by Iron man and hulk were hilarious. In all, an excellent movie with lots of action and style. One of the best super hero movie of all time. Go for it.",9,2,5,27 April 2012
