Vertigo," Easily, One of Hitchcock's Best
","Every time I see this movie, it totally blows me away and leaves me with chills. It's very rare that a movie has that kind of effect on me. I could watch it over and over and not get sick of it because it's one of those movies where you pick up on new things every time you see it. It truly is one of the most brilliant films of all time.Jimmy Stewart rules, like always. I would say that he may be the greatest actor in history and put together with Hitchcock, he definitely couldn't go wrong. The story is perfectly crafted and a bit complex so be sure to pay attention when you see it. I cannot recommend this movie enough and you won't know what I'm talking about until you see it for yourself.Vertigo is a film that fully consumes the viewer. Any movie fan needs to see it. I tell you the truth!",10,5,6,22 March 2008
The Incredible Hulk," Not So Incredible
","The Incredible Hulk is a film with a lot of 'non-stop' action sequences and decent special effects, but is there really much more to it than that? My answer would be a simple 'no.' It is nothing more than a typical summer action movie. Iron man was amazing with an awesome storyline, brilliant acting, awesome special effects and bad ass action sequences. Seeing this film after Iron Man was destined to leave me disappointed. I had heard so many good things about it that I was let down.I'm just gonna come out and say that I thoroughly enjoyed the 2003 version of The Hulk as I thought it had a really good storyline and a very good vision. I liked the whole artsy feel. Take out the art, add the film adaptations of The Fantastic 4, only with The Hulk and you have this movie. It's fun but there's nothing else to it. The only things that really keep me from rating it lower are the acting which was phenomenal and the ending which I thought was pretty good. Other than that, it's just mindless fun.Don't go into this film expecting another Iron Man and you should be okay. It's a fun summer, popcorn movie, nothing else!",3,5,10,17 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda," A Lot Better Than Expected!
","I hate talking animal movies and CGI movies so when you put those two together, it's usually a pretty bad combination for me. There have been a few exceptions like most of Disney/Pixar's films and now, Kung Fu Panda. I'm a big fan of kung fu movies and I think most fans will enjoy this movie because it seems to have been made specifically for those people.The story and actually quite good and has a lot of heart. There are some really great action sequences, as well and they really captured the kung fu feel with this movie. I also thought the visuals were great which is rare, at least to me, in a CGI film. There are a lot of very good things about this film that almost everyone should enjoy.Kung fu fans probably won't be disappointed with this one as I had a blast with it. I was expecting total garbage and actually am happy that I saw it. I'll be picking up the DVD when it comes out.",8,4,6,22 June 2008
Unbreakable," An Absolute Modern Masterpiece
","I've lost count on how many times I've seen Unbreakable. It is a film that, for me, never gets old. In fact, I find that I enjoy it more with each viewing.M. Night Shyamalan gives a whole new perspective to the super hero phenomenon. The story is brilliant and the visuals are completely breathtaking. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson give great performances. The ending will also leave you breathless.Anyone who is a comic book fan should see this film. It's great in every sense and you won't be disappointed. Just sit back, relax, and prepare to be amazed.",10,0,0,13 November 2007
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Nothing That Hasn't Been Done Before
","The Apatow group has come out with another comedy. While there were entertaining jokes throughout, I felt that this was nothing new. Just another romantic comedy about finding 'the one.' But there is one difference with this film... Male nudity, great, like anyone needs that. It's not funny it's just vile. I must admit that I am a little shocked at the high rating of this movie. Maybe people will enjoy anything that the Apatow group comes out with.The acting wasn't bad but I felt that some of the characters were a bit annoying and unnecessary. The story was typical, very typical for these kinds of films. As I said, there were definitely a good amount of funny moments but not enough, I believe, to save it from mediocrity.See this film or don't see it. I really don't think it'll make much difference either way. Just my thought.",5,2,6,10 October 2008
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Effing Awesome
","I love South Park, I think it's the funniest show on TV so it's no wonder that I love the movie as well. It's an amazing blend of sarcasm and music thrown in with some of the funniest jokes I've ever seen on film. I enjoyed every second of this one and am happy to have it on my personal DVD shelf.The story is awesome! Terrance and Philip come out with a movie that, according to the MPAA, has too many swear words so the USA decides to start a war against Canada. If you love South Park, you'll be happy to see your favorite characters in a feature length film with some awesome graphics. See it right now!",10,0,0,11 May 2008
That Thing You Do!," Hilarious and Perfect for All Ages
","My family and I used to watch this movie all the time while I was growing up so I may be a little biased here. Even so, I think it's one of the best comedies ever and I quote the lines very often. It really is great to revisit this film and remember when I was a little kid sitting on the couch watching it with my family. I was able to revisit it this weekend.I really feel that all of the characters are very well thought out, essential parts of any band and very well portrayed by all of the actors. Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler, Steve Zahn and Ethan Embry are all great. The story itself is the best part of this film and really says a lot about being in a band. 'Ain't no way to keep a band together, bands come and go. You gotta keep on playin', no matter with who.' This movie is great. I recommend it for the whole family and definitely if you are or have been in a band. You'll love it!",9,1,2,12 October 2008
Ed Wood," Maybe Burton's Best
","Ed Wood is one of my all time favorite directors. Yes, he made bad films and generally had no idea what he was doing, but he was a very humble guy and he never let bad press get in the way of doing what he had a true passion for, making movies. The problem with the guys making bad horror movies today(Uwe Boll, Ulli Lommel, Eli Roth) is that they all seem arrogant and that is such a shame. Ed Wood is a hero of mine for sticking to what he loved and still keeping a good head on his shoulders. So it's no wonder why I loved this movie so much.I found a copy of this at the library and I was expecting it to be good but not nearly as good as it was. See, I was expecting a fairly depressing drama that left me feeling cold, but what I got was a quirky and fun comedy with some dramatic elements. I knew from the second that this one started that it was going to be a new favorite of mine.Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have come to be one of my favorite film duos. This film is no exception to their greatness. All of the actors are absolutely wonderful in their roles. The story is great because it mostly sticks to the true story and I really appreciated that. I also love that it was filmed in black and white to give it the whole 'Ed Wood' feel. I had so much fun watching it.If you like Ed Wood's films and you're interested in the story of his life, this movie is certainly for you. I can't recommend it enough and I think you'll enjoy it as much as I have. Give a chance, please!",10,3,3,18 February 2008
Juno," I'm Glad it Didn't Win Best Picture
","I know I'm a little bit late but I'm trying to see all of the Academy Award nominees for best picture. No Country for Old Men was brilliant and definitely deserves the title, There Will Be Blood was also amazing and a great runner up. This comes to the third movie I've seen thus far, Juno. I was not impressed with this one as much as everyone else seems to be. I enjoyed it, i just didn't think it was anything to rave about and I can't understand why it was nominated. Pretentious lines and a simple message don't make a movie a masterpiece, sorry.The acting was great from just about everyone. The only acting problem I had was Michael Cera, I mean sure, he's great but he always seems to be the exact same character. The story could have been great, COULD have, but it was overshadowed by the film's need to be witty and precocious. I thought some of the lines were really funny and almost laughed out loud, but it didn't make the movie for me. The cinematography, I thought, was fantastic. Oh and one last thing, the music was awful! I usually don't really mind music if it's bad in movies but this was just plain annoying. I guess I'm in the minority, but I wasn't enthralled by this one.If you haven't seen this film, don't let my negativity prevent you from doing so. Clearly, a lot of people have loved it to death so maybe you will too. Decide for yourself.",4,45,94,2 March 2008
X-Men," The Best of the Series
","I really enjoyed this movie a lot when it first came out 8 long years ago and I decided to revisit it with my little brother tonight and enjoyed it just as much as I did back then. I think it's definitely one of the better Marvel films and up there with the first Spider-Man and Iron Man. I'm definitely glad I decided to check it out again.There are a lot of great elements in this film and I thought the story along with the effects were both great. The acting was really good as well with great performances from James Marsden and Hugh Jackman. I thought they did a great job of adapting the comic book into this film as I've been a big fan of the comic books since I was very little kid.Most Marvel fans have most likely seen this film, and a few times over. However, if you haven't yet, you really should do yourself the favor of checking it out. You probably will enjoy it quite a bit.",9,0,1,24 June 2008
Zodiac," A Wonderful Account
","I've been meaning to see Zodiac ever since it hit theaters early last year but the first time I got around to it was last night. To put it simply, I was blown away by this film. I was a little skeptical because I usually get a little annoyed with movies that are over two hours but this one kept my attention the entire time.The director of Se7en, David Fincher, also directs this one and I would go as far as saying that it's just as good as Se7en. Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. are all astounding in their roles but I guess that's to be expected from these great actors. The story sticks very well to the original accounts and the murders are gruesome and brilliantly done. Everybody should see this film.On an ending note, I think everyone who liked Se7en will love Zodiac. It's already making its way to the bargain bins so pick it up today.",10,1,4,30 January 2008
Cloverfield," The Best PG-13 Sci-fi/Horror Film in Years
","Let's be totally honest here... PG-13 horror movies absolutely suck with very few exceptions. The characters are annoying and unlikable, the acting is usually bad, and the suspense is terrible. I think this is all due to toning these films down so that they're acceptable for a wider age range, but it's still a pain. This movie goes against that rule fully and completely.I loved so much about this film. The POV cam gave it that real feeling, kind of like watching a home movie of a UFO landing or something like that. The story is simple but it has a right to be as this is only documenting a group of people trying to survive these attacks. I only have one complaint about this film and it's the acting, it was very rough at times and completely unbelievable but the rest of the film made up for it. I will definitely being seeing this again.Anyone who is a fan of films like Gojira and The Host or The Blair Witch Project and Behind the Mask will find a place for this film somewhere in their heart. See it on the big screen!",8,1,4,20 January 2008
Sleepy Hollow," An Original Piece, Despite the Title
","I am a die hard fan of Washington Irving's story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. This is based on that story but just barely. I would call it an original story with the same names and some of the same back stories. If you want to see an exact adaptation of the story, you will be sadly disappointed but if you're looking for a great horror film from Tim Burton, there is no way you will have any problem with this. I would say it's one of his best films.Ichabod Crane(Johnny Depp), an investigator sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow where a number of bizarre deaths involving decapitation have taken place, comes across Katrina Van Tassel(Christina Ricci), Baltus Van Tassel(Michael Gambon) and The Headless Horseman(Christopher Walken). As you can see, the cast is awesome and there are many more awesome stars other than the ones I have mentioned. The story is very creepy and intense the entire way through. There are also some great special effects and the gore is absolutely spot on. Tim Burton has become one of my all time favorite directors and this is definitely one of the movies that put him in that spot for me. His direction is amazing.As I said earlier, you're going to hate this film if you want it to follow the original story. However, it is a great movie on its own and that's exactly the way it should be watched. The Horseman comes, and tonight, he comes for you!",9,0,0,29 March 2008
Taxi Driver," Maybe the Greatest Crime Drama Ever
","How I had gone so long without seeing this film, I do not know but I am very grateful that I finally did because it's one of my new favorite movies. Sadly, I haven't seen too many of Scorsese's work but this is definitely the best of his films that I have seen. Taxi Driver deserves to go down as one of the greatest movies of this or any time.I think the greatest thing about this movie is that it's so much more than just an entertaining movie that you watch with popcorn and forget a few weeks later. It is a very profound character study. It shows the gradual steps that it takes for the main character, Travis Bickle, to finally lose it. It does this so well and captivates the viewer almost perfectly.Robert DeNiro nails his performance and brings as much as possible to the character. Jodie Foster gives a great performance as well and so does the rest of the cast. This movie probably couldn't have been cast any better.The best part in any movie, I always say, is the story and this film is no exception. It has one of the most well written scripts I have ever seen on screen. The characters, the instances, the dialog and everything else are almost perfectly written. It also has one of the most insane climax's that I remember seeing.See this movie! There really is no other way to say it. You really just need to experience it for yourself because words will never do it justice!",10,0,2,11 September 2008
Full Metal Jacket," The Best War Movie Ever Made
","Most folks would say that Apocalypse Now is the greatest war movie of all time. I beg to differ, for I have just seen Full Metal Jacket for the first time. Full Metal Jacket is not only great because of how it portrays how ridiculous war is but also because it shows how dark and twisted human kind really is. I am absolutely blown away by this amazing piece of cinema.The story starts off comedic and heads in that direction for a little while but then gets dramatic almost immediately. There is plenty of action and suspense. This movie, like most great films is a deep character study. The great acting adds so much to this. There is honestly virtually nothing wrong with this movie and it is a new favorite of mine. Stanley Kubrick was the man! Stanley Kubrick fans will definitely enjoy this movie but I think everyone else will also. It really is a beautiful film if you look at it as more than a Vietnam film.",10,0,2,18 September 2008
Fargo," Fargo Rules!
","Fargo is a very good and intense film from the Coens that does a great job of keeping the viewer hooked on the screen. My favorite of theirs is still No Country for Old Men but this would definitely be a close second. It's filled with action, suspense, blood, and even quite a bit of dry humor here and there. If that sounds like your cup of tea, you definitely need to check it out.The story is brilliant with a lot of twists and turns and things I didn't see coming. The acting is utterly amazing but from William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi and the rest of the great cast, you shouldn't expect much less at all. The action and blood are great also and I just loved the entire tone of the film in general. This is one that I will probably end up watching again and again.See this movie if you like the Coens or crime dramas in general. i daresay that you will have a great time doing so.",9,0,0,28 April 2008
Hot Rod," Quite Possibly '07's Funniest
","A friend of mine informed me that I just have to see this film of random comedy similar to Tom Green's brand of humor. Being a big fan of that kind of comedy, I just couldn't resist. This movie was even better than I expected.I liked a few 2007 comedies. I thought Knocked Up was good and I absolutely loved Superbad, but I think this film beats all of them. It follows a very simple storyline and it may not be the most well done movie ever, but the jokes are absolutely spot on and I couldn't stop laughing even once. Expect good performances from the Lonely Island guys and be prepared to laugh.To wrap things up, I think anyone who is a fan of offbeat comedy like Napoleon Dynamite, Freddy Got Fingered, or Superbad should give this one a viewing. You may be surprised at what you see.",10,2,6,19 January 2008
The Shining," A Rare Occurrence: Better than the Book
","Stephen King did not like this adaptation of his book because it strayed from the original story so much, but I think that's what made this movie as amazing as it is. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, but I honestly think that Stanley Kubrick came up with a better story that is much more atmospheric and terrifying.The ever brilliant Jack Nicholson continues to amaze in this film and is truly horrifying as Jack Torrence. The rest of the cast is great but there are some iffy moments from Shelly Duvall. The story is great and Stanley Kubrick's direction is unbelievable. I wish he hadn't died.If you call yourself a horror fan and you haven't seen this movie, then you're not a horror fan. It's as simple as that. Stop sitting around and see it!",10,1,2,12 October 2008
Wanted," Moronic is the Word
","I miss simple films. You know, like Rear Window, Rope, and Duel. Rope and Rear Window take place in the same room for the most part and Duel is pretty much just on the highway but the stories are so powerful that it keeps the viewer hooked and on the edge of their seat. Now, let's talk about Wanted. A movie that is nothing like those classics in any way, shape or form. Wanted is movie that is so void of anything with substance that the producers tried to cover it up with a bunch of special effects and cuts every two seconds. I like to enjoy cinematography in a movie, appreciate what kinds of shots are in the film. This movie doesn't allow you to do that because the shot changes every few seconds. It's headache inducing! The acting isn't great at all. Morgan Freeman is pretty good but he's literally the only one who seemed to have any idea what he was doing whatsoever. Angelina Jolie is annoying and non-dimensional and she added nothing to her character. A lot of people have been happy about how James McAvoy is getting leading roles after his portrayal of Tumnus in Narnia. Well, his role in Narnia must have been a fluke because he was terrible in this, I think over-acting is the word. Over all, I wasn't impressed with the cast.The story is totally empty. It's like The Matrix minus a purpose or any form of coherency. I really can't say much more about the plot because there really isn't one at all. It's just a mess of special effects and bad acting with no character development.This movie is total crap. Don't waste your time on it. It is nothing more than a rip-off of other films with no storyline to back it up.",3,5,14,4 July 2008
Apocalypse Now," Didn't Live Up to the Hype for Me
","Note: This review is based on the Apocalypse Now Redux edition, I have not seen the original version.I'm going to start off by saying that I didn't enjoy Apocalypse Now. Is it a great and very well done film that deserves its place in film history? Yes it is, but am I in a hurry to see it again? No, I'm not. I liked it well enough but I guess it's one of those movies that I will be content only seeing once, well at least the Redux. I need to check out the original because I hear it's much better.Martin Sheen is awesome and so is everybody else, especially Laurence Fishburne who I was surprised to see. I haven't seen a ton of Coppolla's films but I will try to catch up one his work, he did a great job directing this movie. I liked the story as I loved Heart of Darkness and I really like what it has to say about war. It also shows how absurd war can be at times, I'm talking about the playboy bunny scene and the surfers. I'm glad I saw it but I don't know if I will again.Everybody should see this movies because of its status in the film world. But don't make the mistake I did, see the theatrical version first.",9,0,2,19 February 2008
Disturbia," If you see it, show up after the first 70 minutes
","OK, now I wasn't expecting this movie to be ground breaking but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad either. In what feels like the first 2 hours of the film, even though it's only about an hour and a half long, we go through so many teen thriller clichés. Shia Laboeuf and David Morse's performance's were pretty good but unfortunately, they were the only one's. The girl and the best friend, who cares what the actor's names are, were horrendous. The climax of the film was decent but once again, very cliché for a thriller. All in all, what we have here is a cheap Rear Window/Red Eye rip off. I wouldn't even say to wait to rent it, just wait till your library has it so you don't need to spend money on it.",2,9,19,15 April 2007
Tropic Thunder," More Than Just A Comedy
","Tropic Thunder is a great movie for a lot of different reasons and there it is not offensive or racist, as people have been claiming. It is certainly ridiculous and over the top but I think it has to be. There are so many laugh out loud moments in this movie but it also very well thought out and intriguing.Ben Stiller does a good job of acting and maybe even a better job of directing. I loved the entire cast. Jack Black is hilarious, and Robert Downey Jr. amazed me with his ability to do so many different voices and characters. I think this may actually be the only movie I've ever like Tom Cruise in but I was almost rolling on the floor laughing at most of his scenes. I also thought the story was top notch and very well thought out, especially for a comedy. This is one you won't want to miss! I know the summer is almost over but you should check this movie out before it comes to a close. It is the perfect summer popcorn movie and a lot more!",9,2,7,18 August 2008
No Country for Old Men," Perhaps the Greatest Movie of All Time
","If this isn't the great movie ever made, it certainly deserves to be in the top 5. I was completely blown away with everything about it. I feel that this movie takes film making to a level it's never been to before and does it beautifully. Anyone who happened to give this movie a negative review really doesn't understand a good movie when they see. It is absolutely brilliant in every way, shape and form. It deserved to win best picture and it did win best picture so I guess the Academy doesn't always get things wrong. If any of this sounds bold to you, see the movie and then tell me I'm wrong, I dare you.Joel and Ethan Coen once again have made a movie that truly shows that they are two of the greatest directors of all time. The acting is utterly amazing from everyone. Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Kelly Macdonald all give the performances of their careers but the best performance was Javier Bardem's. His character is one of the most creepy and well thought out villains I have ever seen on screen and he nailed it perfectly. The story is extremely well crafted and the fact that there is no music makes it much more intense and it also makes it feel like it moves along very fast. The gore/violence is very convincing. There are so many good things about this movie that it would be far too much to list.I don't care what kind of movies you are generally into. Every single person on this planet needs to see this movie as soon as possible. If you are a fan of film in general, you'll absolutely love everything about it.",10,2,8,19 March 2008
Batman Begins," Fantastic but Not as good as its Sequel
","I saw The Dark Knight last week and I was absolutely blown away by its brilliance and everything about it in general. After seeing it, I decided to revisit one of my favorite movies and its predecessor, Batman Begins. I think that The Dark Knight is a candidate for the greatest movie of all time so I didn't think Batman Begins was as good but that doesn't mean it isn't an overall great film that deserves all its recognition and the number 100 spot on the top 250.Bale is the best Batman. There's no way around that, he simply just is. Everyone else is great and perfect for their roles. They all added so much depth to this film. The effects and storyline are wonderful also.This is a must for any Batman fan and you should probably check it out before you go and see The Dark Knight.",10,2,4,25 July 2008
Peaceful Warrior," Tries Far Too Hard to Be Inspirational and Comes off As Cheesy
","I honestly am let down quite a bit by this film. It's a good movie, yes, but I heard from a few different people that it's one of the greatest films of all time so I was expecting a life changing film. What I got, however, was a slightly more depressing and less good version of The Karate Kid. Maybe it'll grow on me if I watch it again, but that's my impression so far.We all know that Victor Salva's a total creep but I don't think that makes him a terrible filmmaker, despite how creepy it is that he always shows young men with no shirts on in his films. The acting was mediocre at best. Nick Nolte was great as usual but the rest weren't too great, especially Amy Smart. I get so annoyed by Amy Smart. On to the story. The story is alright but far too preachy and 'inspirational' for me. The lines were almost hilariously cheesy and I just wanted them to stop. The ending was also cheesy and a little tedious. Don't get me wrong, I liked the film but there was nothing more to it than that. I have trouble being inspired by sports movies.",6,3,5,24 April 2008
Across the Universe," I may be the only one, but I wasn't impressed
","I thought Across the Universe was alright, but seriously, nothing to rave about. I felt it dragged on for too long, some of the songs were totally irrelevant to the plot, and almost every actor except for the main 3 were totally pointless, especially Prudence and Bono's character. The acting and singing were both fantastic, but I always get super annoyed when anyone tries to sing Beatles songs. Why mess with perfection? This film also got away with quite a bit for being PG-13... Drugs, nudity, language, etc. It seems to glorify drug use, which I find ignorant. All in all, I felt that this movie would have been much better if they had just gone with the story and not turned it into a musical. Maybe someday I'll come to appreciate more but for now, I'm not impressed.",4,0,5,13 October 2007
The Mist," Refreshing
","After countless terrible King adaptations, Darabont has really done something awesome with The Mist. I absolutely loved this movie and am very satisfied with the adaptation. I was actually terrified the whole time and then at the end, I was so utterly shocked that I had to just sit there and stare at the screen while the credits continued to roll. I can't give it away but it will blow your mind! The acting is very solid the whole time with power house performances from Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden and Andre Braugher. I loved the story and was genuinely creeped out by it the entire time. There is great gore and some great creatures, however, I felt that the CGI bogged these down a bit, but that's the only thing I can really complain about. Otherwise, it's a brilliant horror film.Horror fans owe it to themselves to check out The Mist. It's an essential for anyone who gets there kicks from being scared. See it as so as you possibly can!",9,1,2,9 June 2008
The Elephant Man," Emotionally Exhausting but the Most Beautiful Film I've Ever Seen
","This may be the greatest movie of all time. I know for a fact that I have never been more moved by a film in my entire life and i doubt I ever will be again. I have never cried during a movie because I never find something on screen to be that touching. I learn to care about the characters and the story but never become attached enough to really feel it emotionally. However, I must admit that tears were sliding down my face at several points during The Elephant Man. I really fell in love with everything about this film.It is definitely a David Lynch film, there is no refuting that. It has his lighting, his eerie sound effects and his feeling of tension throughout most of the film. This difference between this film and his others is that it is a very straight forward story. Don't get me wrong, I love his weird and confusing movies 100 percent, but it is awesome to see movies that he branched out on.The story is breathtaking. I have to admit that I don't know the real story of John Merrick very well but I have read a little about it and it seems that at least portions of the film are, in fact, reenactments of things that really happened. I saw some pictures online of the real John Merrick and I have to say that they did a great job of turning John Hurt into the character. His wonderful acting only added to the dimension of The Elephant Man. Everyone else does amazing work in their roles, especially a young Anthony Hopkins who, I believe, was perfect for the role of Dr. Treves. I wish I could put this film into words but it is impossible. You just have to see it.I don't think anyone will have a problem with this movie and I think that everyone should see it. It is more of an experience than it is a movie so be prepared to be attached to the story and the characters. The faint of heart will not find it an easy view but I guarantee that it is completely worth the tears!",10,1,1,5 June 2008
Dog Day Afternoon," Not What I Was Expecting
","I thought this movie was very good, I don't think it's top 250 good but I was impressed and entertained by it all the same. My only real complaint was that I didn't feel this movie needed to be two hours long, I felt that many of the scenes could have been cut down a good amount. I was bored at times.The acting is flawless but you can't expect much else from the great Al Pacino, of course. The story was well thought out and portrayed and there were a lot of great action sequences. There's really not much wrong with it at all, I just didn't think it was great as everyone else has said.See this for yourself and you'll probably enjoy it as much as everyone else. I really liked it a lot, but was just a tad disappointed.",8,0,0,10 September 2008
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A Classic
","Henry Selick did an amazing job adapting Tim Burton's original story of this Halloween/Christmas classic. I just bought the new two-disc set and am very happy to own it. I am a very big Tim Burton fan and this is definitely a Burton film so fans will not be let down. Watch it as soon as you can!The singing is amazing as well as the songs themselves and all of the characters are brilliant. The story is the driving force and easily the best part of the movie but the amazing visuals and stop motion animation would be a very close second. I was blown away by how this film looked as well as everything else.If you grew up on this film like I did, you owe it to yourself to get the new DVD set. It's like experiencing the film for the first time all over again. Give it a chance!",10,5,6,2 September 2008
Mulholland Drive," Mind Blowing
","I saw Mulholland Drive a few years back but I didn't seem to remember much about it when I revisited it last night. I don't know how that was possible because this movie was so bizarre and terrifying that it will, without a doubt, stay in my head for the rest of my life even if I decide to never watch it again. Lynch truly is a master, and I have never been more frightened by a movie.Lynch has a created another ambiguous but very intriguing story with this movie and it has the single most horrifying scene I have ever seen of film. It involves a homeless man towards the beginning of the of the movie. The acting is fantastic. Naomi Watts and Laura Harring are great as the leads and everyone else was brilliant as well. As usual for David Lynch, the soundtrack is very creepy and eerie and adds to the movie very well. I still think Eraserhead is his best but this is a close second.If you're a fan of David Lynch, this is an essential. Not only is it visually amazing but it'll grab you and hold you for the entire time it runs. It's so terrifying that it is hard to watch at times but it's amazing!",10,3,4,12 April 2008
The Evil Dead," The One That Started It All
","Last night I watched The Evil Dead for the first time. Being a horror junkie, I can't believe I waited so long to see this one. It's one of the scariest, most original films ever made.The entire premise of the movie gave me chills the whole time. Just the whole idea of a curse that takes over your body coming to a bunch of kids in an abandoned cabin in the woods is crazy. Bruce Campbell, as always, does an amazing job along with all of the other actors/actresses. Just about everything about this film was amazing.Fans of horror, don't make the same mistake I made for so long. See this movie right now!",9,3,6,19 January 2008
Big Fish," Beautiful is the Best Way to Describe It
","Tim Burton's Big Fish is an absolute masterpiece and one of my new all time favorite movies. I just finished watching it for the first time and I am still sitting here, feeling amazed. Tim Burton is one of my favorite, if not my favorite modern director and he shows me why with every film I see of his. This gave me the same blown away feeling as films like Edward Scissorhand, Ed Wood, Sweeney Todd, and Sleepy Hollow.The story is the whole backbone to the movie so it has to be amazing and it definitely is. The visuals and effects are dazzling also. The acting is awesome from everyone. The direction is utterly brilliant as well. THis is a big winner according to me! Tim Burton fans, see this movie!!! Now!!! I'm not kidding!!!!",10,0,0,26 April 2008
The Dark Knight," You Won't Want it to End!
","I am still processing the brilliance that is The Dark Knight. I had very high hopes for this because of people saying it is the greatest super hero movie of all time and even that it is much more than a super hero film but a very well thought out crime/drama. My expectations were exceeded. I'm not so sure that it deserves to be ranked as the number one movie of all time but this is THE best movie of its kind and I don't think any movie can take that title away any time soon. I was a huge fan of Batman Begins but it is surpassed by this work of genius.This year, as recent years, have had a few good and bad comic books flicks to hit the big screen. We had Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, and while I loved Iron Man and think it is one of the best this year, The Dark Knight makes it look like an episode of The Teletubbies. Sure, it is a very dark film and unlike the Marvel films, it is not very lighthearted but that's one of the best things about, it will stick with you. I have liked a few movies this year quite a bit and while I think The Happening is still my favorite, The Dark Knight is just as good.The story, gosh, I could go on for hours about the story. It is brilliantly and brought to screen with so many memorable characters and events that will make you want this movie to go on for hours and hours, the two and a half hours didn't seem long enough to me but I was still very satisfied. The acting is wonderful from Christian Bale and everyone and I daresay that Heat Ledger's unbelievable performance is greater than that of Jack Nicholson as The Joker. I was also blown away by the special effects and CGI. Usually, CGI bugs the crap out of me but it is literally seamless in this film. There are so many amazing things about this movie.Batman fans, movie fans, and oh hell, even if you hate this movie, you need to see it. I find no reason why anyone should dislike it. Maybe that's why it's ranked at number 1!",10,4,9,20 July 2008
Green Street Hooligans," A Crappy Premise Executed Well
","I liked this movie, it was a very entertaining piece about gangs in London. However, there really isn't much more to it than fighting and I think it's a overrated in that sense. It is very fun to watch and even exciting and heartfelt at times but it's really hard for me to take it completely serious because it's a little ridiculous. I simply do not feel that it is a masterpiece in any way.The cast is great, I usually get really annoyed with Elijah Wood, and sort of still did, but I think he did a fantastic job in general. The story, as I said, is fairly one dimensional, it really revolves around gang fights and not much more but it was done extremely well. Kudos to the director for taking such a weak story and actually making a good film out it.It's not an amazing piece of cinema or a masterpiece but it is worth a look. I would recommend it to tell the truth.",7,0,1,26 June 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Movie that Words Can't Describe
","I just saw this movie for the first time since I was probably 8 years old and I'm almost speechless. I think I would have to say that in my opinion, this is the greatest movie ever made. I don't know what else to say, I am that moved by this film. It has to be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen on screen. Stanley Kubrick's films tend to be really long but they always go by fast for me and this one went by the fastest. It's unreal! Everything about this movie is genius. The story is captivating and wonderful from start to finish. Some may say it's a little slow but I loved every detail. There are so many different feelings and emotions that come along with this movie, it's almost overwhelming. I loved the visuals and anyone would be crazy not to. This is film-making at its finest and a true brilliant work from one of the best directors in the history of cinema.I can't urge you to see this movie enough. You will be blown away and begging for more. See it and enjoy it!",10,2,7,20 September 2008
Saw," The Best Modern Horror Film
","Let me start off by saying that I am NOT a Saw franchise fan boy. I absolutely despise every single sequel to this film that the studios have somehow managed to churn out. This film is different from all of it's sequels. It is a well thought out, and extremely well written film with a lot going for it. I love this film and I revisit it every Halloween.As I was saying, this movie is best if think of it as its own film and not the first of a franchise. The story is one of the most brilliant and intricate things I've seen in recent years. The acting is definitely rough but it didn't take away from the movie for me. I also love the score, it adds a lot.Saw is a good movie, the Saw franchise sucks. Stay away from the sequels and just see Saw. The sequels honestly ruin it!",10,3,8,6 October 2008
The Happening," I Will Never Understand People
","M. Night Shyamalan has created a very original story with a lot of creative ideas, amazing tone and brilliant shock and suspense scenes that would make even Hitchcock proud. So why all the hate for such an awesome movie? The only conclusion I can come up with is that either people just love to hate on Shyamalan, as was evident with The Village, or they just wanna see more rehashing. People must love love all of the sequels(Indiana Jones 4, The Incredible Hulk), remakes and adaptations(Speed Racer, Iron Man), and the straight forward rip-offs(The Strangers, The Ruins), etc. etc. Don't get me wrong, I liked most of these movies with the exception of the rip-offs and Speed Racer but The Happening is far superior because it actually has originality. It truly, in my opinion, is the greatest movie of 2008 so far and maybe the best movie of the past few years.I loved everything about the story. The thing about Shyamalan is that people always complain about his movies being unbelievable or unrealistic and this simply makes me angry. A movie is not to be watched the intention of learning about the world, it meant to be watched to see a story. It doesn't need to be realistic, it doesn't need to follow some sort of snobbish standard. It's art for God's sake! Anyways, back to what I was saying about the story. It moves amazingly well and I was upset to see it finally end because I wanted it to keep going. There are a lot of shocking and very disturbing moments which is why I was surprised that more horror fans weren't impressed. After all of his PG-13 films, I thought this would have had very little violence and barely deserved the R rating because most of his movies have been pretty tame. I'll tell you right now that it definitely earned the R rating. It is one of the most gruesome and disturbing Hollywood releases I've seen in a long time.I also wanted to mention how people have been complaining so much about the acting in this film. It was definitely bizarre and awkward but I thought that it followed along with the story and helped the movie create its own little world in that sense. I thought the whole cast did a great job.Don't buy a ticket to this one if you want to see another rehash of something that's already been done. It is a truly different film and I think it is ahead of its time. Shyamalan is one of the only directors out there still doing original work, and he does a damn good job of it if you ask me.",10,99,195,13 June 2008
The Departed," Great Movie
","I haven't seen the original Infernal Affairs yet but after seeing this and loving it, I will definitely check it out. The Departed was a great movie that kept me entertained for the whole two and a half hours which is very rare for someone like me who usually likes his movies an hour and a half or under. This one did well though.All the actors were fantastic except for Matt Damon, not that he's a bad actor, he just always seems like the exact same person no matter what character he's playing. The story was awesome with some brilliant plot twists. I also loved the blood and just the overall look of the film. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon.If you're into crime/thrillers, this one is definitely for you. Don't miss it!",9,1,6,24 February 2008
There Will Be Blood," Completely Deserves its Recognition
","This was definitely one of 2007's best films and one of the best in recent years. Though I liked No Country for Old men a bit better, this was still amazing. Anyone who says this film is overrated or just plain bad should really look again because this was completely brilliant and well thought out. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.Daniel Day Lewis deserves his Oscar for best actor 100% but all of the other actors were amazing as well. My other two favorites were Dillon Freasier and Paul Dano. The story is very well crafted and has a lot of very good messages hidden. Had No Country for Old Men not been in the running, I think this should have won best picture.Anyone who loves movies owes it to themselves to see this piece of brilliance. You won't be disappointed if you look hard enough.",10,1,6,1 March 2008
A Hard Day's Night," Hilarious and Lighthearted Film from the Fab Four
","I remember seeing this when I was a really little kid and not getting and simply just thinking it was super weird. I revisited it tonight and I love this movie! It's got some very clever humor and nearly hits every joke dead on. I found myself laughing quite a bit and you probably will too if you sit down to watch 'A Hard Day's Night.' Paul, John, George and Ringo weren't actors and it certainly shows in this film but I think their sort of awkward performances add to the random humor quite a bit so I can't say they were bad actors. Being a huge fan of The Beatles, I automatically dug all of the music and was singing along. The story is weak but it has the right to be. And as I said earlier, the humor is brilliant. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and I can't wait to watch it again. You should check it out too!",8,1,1,16 March 2008
Army of Darkness," Hail to the King, Baby, His Name is Bruce Campbell
","Finally finishing off the Evil Dead series, I just got done watching Army of Darkness. It's probably the most comical of the bunch, but it's still a great movie. Army of Darkness definitely deserves a spot on every horror fan's movie shelf.Bruce Campbell is hilarious and awesome as always with a stellar performance as his character Ash. The special effects are amazing as well and the story is truly 'epic.' Medieval horror films are very rare and this is quite possibly the best. You won't be let down if you liked the first two.After Evil Dead II's open ending, I simply couldn't wait to see Army of Darkness. It certainly was worth the few day's wait. What are you waiting for? See it already!",8,3,4,23 January 2008
August Rush," A Modern Fairy Tale
","I just caught a viewing of this one at the local dollar theater with my family. I usually can't stand sappy, family stories but this one had an effect on me. Maybe it's because I'm a big music fan, or maybe it's because this one was much more well done than the others. Either way, it was definitely worth the $1.50 ticket.Freddie Highmore is definitely a fantastic, up and coming young actor who we will definitely be seeing more of in the years to come. All of the other performances were nearly spot on, except Robin Williams, not that he's bad, I'm just tired of him. The only things that keep me from giving this film a 10 are the lack of dialog, long and drawn out scenes, and as I said, Robin Williams.August Rush is a great movie to see with the family and I recommend it to anyone who's looking to kill a couple hours.",9,2,5,26 January 2008
Jaws," Makes Me Wish Spielberg Still Understood Suspense
","I'm not saying that Steven Spielberg doesn't make good movies anymore, I just think that he has lost his feel for suspense. In two of his early films, this and Duel, the suspense was so brilliantly crafted and unexpected. I wish he still made films like this. Jaws is one of the best films in history, hands down! I know I'm definitely not the first to say all these things about Jaws but there are many reasons why so many have. The acting, the script, the shooting, the score and the setting are all amazing. Like most people, I was scared to go in the water when I was a kid because of this film. It's that scary! I think the fact that the shark is rarely shown adds so much to the suspense factor because you have to use your imagination. Mark my words, this film is truly terrifying.If you haven't seen Jaws, you've probably been living under a rock for the past 3 decades. Come out into the light and enjoy Spielberg's best. You can quote me on that!",10,2,4,3 October 2008
Hancock," I Guess It's Okay
","This movie is a complete 50/50, right down the middle. It started out good and actually kept going that way for about the first 50 minutes but then it all comes crashing down almost immediately. It was as if the writers gave up after the first half and decided to write something that would appeal to Hollywood. I was actually impressed at how quickly this movie went downhill.I've never been a fan of Will Smith. I mean, I never thought he was too great of an actor and his roles are usually cliché or just plain annoying to me. This was pretty much the same. He had some really funny lines but as a whole, I didn't like his character at all. The rest of the cast was pretty good in general and there were some good characters.The story, what can I say about the story? let's be honest, it sucks. even the first half didn't have much of a story going for it. However, when the second half roles around, you'll wish they didn't try to add more of a plot because the lack of one would have actually worked with this film. It tries far too hard to be inspirational and 'cool.' They should have kept going with the comedy thing and it would have been fine. It still wouldn't have been a great movie by any means but it would have been better than what the final product turned out to be.Wait until you can see this movie for free because it isn't worth the price of admission. It's totally average and even down right bad toward the end of the film. It's nothing to get excited about, at all!",5,2,7,3 July 2008
WALL·E," An Almost Unbelievable Film... Yes, it's That Good
","Not only do I find this to be one of the best films of all time, not only do I believe that it's the greatest Disney/Pixar film ever made, but I think it's a candidate for the best animated film in the history of movies. Everything about this film is sheer brilliance. I saw it this morning and I am still blown away by it. Everyone needs to see this movie, there are no exceptions! The story is probably the most amazing part of the film. The makers successfully created a very intriguing and intelligent story that has no dialog at all for the first half of the movie. The characters are extremely well thought out and very accessible and likable.Let's get to the animation, shall we? This is, hands down, the best animation I have ever seen on film to date, and I've seen a lot of movies. The visuals are absolutely stunning and every tiny little detail is thought out and shown. I couldn't believe my eyes.This is a movie that has to be seen in theaters first. Do yourself a favor and go see it right away. It is film making at its finest!",10,5,9,17 July 2008
Scream," Puts All Other Modern Slashers to Shame
","Scream has been on my list of must see films for quite a while. I didn't think it looked very good but so many people rave about it, so I had to check it out for myself. I made a good decision.This film is one of the most original films of that last two decades. It takes a look at all of the horror/slasher clichés and says 'we're gonna do something different here.' The writing and acting are both great and, unless your friends have given it away, you won't see half of it coming from a mile away.Scream is a movie that no horror fan should go without seeing. If you're a big fan of classic horror, check it out!",8,0,1,11 November 2007
Iron Man," '08's Best? Maybe. A Great Film in Every Way? Definitely!
","A lot of people have been raving that this is 2008's best movie, and while it very well may be so far, the year isn't even half over yet so we'll just have to wait and see. Iron Man is an amazing film that blew me away. I thought I was going to be let down because of all the hype but it's become one of my favorite super hero movies. So if you're wondering if it lives up to all the hype, the answer is a very enthusiastic 'yes.' I was very impressed with the storyline and I loved how well everything was tied together. A lot of super hero, and just action films is general, seem to focus so much on action sequences that they don't really have much time to focus on story and this movie wasn't like that at all. It created a great story. The acting was fantastic also. Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow and everyone else were amazing. I also thought the CGI and special effects were done very well. I usually hate CGI but I really loved the look of it in this movie. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie.I am a big fan of the first Spiderman, the Batman films, the X-Men films, and Superman films and this one definitely deserves to be placed with those. It is the best super hero movie to come along lately and I can't till it's on DVD so I can purchase it. Go see it while it's still in theaters and for once, believe the hype!",8,4,8,4 May 2008
X2: X-Men United," Great Super Hero Film
","I loved the first X-Men and have always loved the comic books and cartoons. This movie amazing for an X-men fan and it's almost as good as the first, not to mention one of the best sequels of all time. I'm making my way through all of the X-Men films and I just finished this one. It truly is a treat for fans.The story is very good and for that reason, it moves very well and you're left wanting more. The acting is just as good, if not a little better than the first. I love all the characters and the creators did a fantastic job of adapting them to the screen. The effects are great also, I usually hate CGI but it was done very well here.See this movie immediately if you're a fan of X-Men. It won't disappoint the true fan!",8,0,0,1 July 2008
Rear Window," Best Movie Ever Made!
","Before I start my review I just want to say this is my favorite movie of all time and I urge anyone reading this to go pick up a copy immediately.Hitchcock directs and Jimmy Stewart stars. Does it get much better than that? Jimmy Stewart plays a photographer, L.B. Jeffries(Jeff) who broke his leg on the job so is now bound to a wheelchair for another week. Jeff becomes obsessed with watching the fellow attendees of his apartment complex through his rear window. He starts to believe that a man across the way has murdered his wife. Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa Fremont(Grace Kelly) also begins to share the same suspicion.Rear Window is a classic that still holds up today. It's funny, heart warming and very suspenseful. Watch it with the whole family!",10,2,6,18 January 2007
300," Another Crapfest from Hack Snyder
","I hated this 'movie.' I can't say it any other way, I literally suffered through the entire 'film' and was praying for it to end, and once it finally did, i was even more angry because of the garbage I had just been fed from so-called director Zack Snyder. I can't put my disdain for this 'film' into words but I will try my hardest to warn you not to see it. Though, I guess if you're a fan of movies like 'XXX' and 'The Fast and the Furious,' you'll probably like this too.I hate Zack Snyder. I've hated him ever since he shamelessly remade my favorite movie of all time, Dawn of the Dead, and turned into a Hollywood pile of trash. His direction is no better in this 'film'. It has no story, horrible characters, and just a bad feel to it in general. I'm also very sick of people saying how visually amazing this 'movie' is. And I'll admit, the colorization looked really good and is the only thing that kept me from giving it a 1/10 rating but the CGI was awful! You may be able to make a piece of poo smell better by spraying perfume on it, but on the inside, it's still fecal matter. That's what they tried to do with this 'movie's' visual effects and it didn't work.Go check this out if you love Hollywood garbage and hack directors. I'm sure it'll be perfect for you if you hate thinking during a movie and just watching fights!",3,0,2,20 July 2008
Pineapple Express," An Unlikely Action/Thriller but a Hilarious one at that
","This is a seriously great and interesting movie from the Apatow group but it is also very different and unique for them. I thought it would be a comedy with crime on the side but I feel that it's sort of the other way around. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of in your face, hilarious comedy, but there is also a ton of awesome action sequences. This is a must see. This summer has been awesome for comedies, with this, Step Brothers and Tropic Thunder.I thought Seth Rogen and James Franco were awesome as the stoner duo, but as usual, Danny R. McBride totally steals the show and his character is the funniest in the movie. I thought the story was very well thought out and moved along near perfectly. There is truly a lot to love about this film.What are you doing? Stop reading this and go see the movie already!",8,3,8,22 August 2008
Jackie Brown," Superb!
","Finally, I have seen Jackie Brown and finished all of Tarantino's films. This one was a fantastic film that I had a lot of fun watching and wondering what was going to happen next. I would say it's better than Death Proof but not as good as his other films, but that doesn't mean it isn't great.The story follows Jackie Brown, a flight attendant from California who gets caught up in some drug problems and an arrest and it just goes from there with some brilliant writing and clever plot twists.. The cast is amazing and how could it not be with the likes of Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, and Robert Forster? The directing is great, of course, as well as the cinematography. You should see it! Tarantino fans will be pleased with this film as it is very much his style. As I said, it's not as good as his other big films but it is definitely worth seeing and maybe even owning. You make the call.",8,1,3,27 February 2008
Sin City," A Fantastic Experience
","I saw this movie when it first came out and hated every little thing about it. Maybe it's because I'm more into films now, or maybe I just didn't understand it at the time, but when I made the decision to re watch this film this weekend, I absolutely loved it. There is not a single thing wrong with this picture and I would even say that it's a sheer masterpiece. I'm not exaggerating.It contains an all star cast that all give brilliant roles. The story is awesome and the direction from Rodriguez and Miller couldn't be better. The visuals are absolutely amazing and the effects are the same. There are two more Sin City's in the works and I can't wait one bit to see these stories continued.See this movie as soon as you can and you won't be let down. Now excuse me, I need to go out and buy it.",10,1,3,3 February 2008
Beetlejuice," Totally Awesome!
","I'm not one of those kids that grew up on this movie but after seeing it for the first time tonight, I wish I was. Everything about it was brilliant and perfect for this time of the year. It truly is a shame that we don't see movies like this today and I think this even deserves a higher rating than 7.3 and a spot on the top 250! Who knew that Michael Keaton had it in him? He shows such range in his portrayal of the character of Beetlejuice. This is definitely a Tim Burton film and it shows immensely. The colors, the feel, the music, everything is Tim Burton. And that is a great thing. He's one of the best directors of our time and I hope he decides to create more films like this. The story is also great. Oh hell, everything is! See this movie, especially now that Halloween is upon us. You won't regret it!",10,3,5,3 October 2008
Evil Dead II," Inferior to The Evil Dead
","I was excited to see The Evil Dead II because I had heard from several different sources that it was better than the first one. I'm going to have to disagree, though it still is a great film. It's kind of a comedy version of the original.The effects in this one are fantastic, the acting, especially from Bruce Campbell, is fantastic and the story does a good job of being fun but still different from the original. I really liked the whole the with the chainsaw for an arm. This is a great movie.Anyone who's seen The Evil Dead needs to pop this in and check it out. You won't be let down.",8,1,2,20 January 2008
Semi-Pro," Pretty Darn Funny if You Ask Me
","I hadn't heard much surrounding this movie at all but a friend and I rented it tonight and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm actually pretty disappointed to see that it only has a 5.8 rating on IMDb, but I guess everyone has different opinions. It's certainly ridiculous and over the top but i think added to how funny it was. All I know is that I was laughing pretty hard most of the way through.Will Ferrell is a favorite of mine, i grew up with him on SNL and I've loved most of his movies. He was just as hilarious as usual in this one. The rest of the cast was great as well. The story is pretty weak but it's just random and funny enough to be okay without it. I thought the randomness was amazing.Check this movie out if you're a fan of comedy. It's not amazing but it is a good laugh. Hell, you even get to see Will Ferrell wrestle a freaking bear!",7,3,4,5 July 2008
