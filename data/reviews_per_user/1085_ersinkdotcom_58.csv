Insidious: Chapter 2," 'Insidious: Chapter 2' successfully follows up its predecessor
","Most people rightfully go into sequels with low expectations. They'll be happy to know that the bar has once again been raised by 'Insidious: Chapter 2.'The Lambert family moves into Josh's childhood house to escape the supernatural powers which manifested themselves in their own home. It doesn't take long to realize that whatever Josh (Patrick Wilson) brought back with him from the spirit world has followed them. The family must come together to uncover the dark secrets of the past and put an end to the otherworldly reign of terror they've been subjected to.Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell fabricate a disturbing and complex tale that perfectly extends the story started with the first 'Insidious.' They've crafted something that stays with you rather than just being a short-term influence on the viewer. I walked away from it thinking I was fairly safe from any after-effects. It wasn't until I slipped into bed, fell asleep, and started having nightmares that I began to comprehend the sort of long-term influence 'Insidious: Chapter 2' had on me.'Insidious: Chapter 2' is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of terror and violence, and thematic elements. It's a straight-shooting supernatural horror film with no detours into adult situations or nudity. I wish more genre movies would borrow from this playbook.If you look at 'Insidious: Chapter 2' from the point of view of a Christian, it might not be for you. It features astral projection and communication with the dead. The afterlife begins with a pit-stop of sorts that seems to be purgatory. However, it's not a nice place as reflected in its dark and shadowy atmosphere. If you can look past these different elements and just enjoy a creepy flick for what it is, this is guaranteed to satisfy.'Insidious: Chapter 2' starts off a little rough because of its awkward editing. The acting was a bit rusty at first as well. The movie finds its footing and makes up for all the above complaints. It has a well- thought out story that builds on, instead of repeats, what we experienced in 'Insidious.'",8,0,0,23 December 2013
The Avengers," One of the best superhero films ever
","Many times a movie is so anticipated with so much buzz surrounding it audiences can't help but be disappointed on some level. Joss Whedon's ' Marvel's The Avengers ' had a lot to prove as it hit theaters at midnight on May 4. When building up a movie through five separate ones over a span of five years, you better be able to deliver. I'm happy to say cast and crew delivered big time.'Marvel's The Avenger' is probably one of the best superhero films ever made. That's a lot coming from me because I'm a DC Comics guy. I don't even read Marvel or keep up with the Universe. I recommend spending the extra money to see the movie in IMAX 3D for the complete experience. If you're a fan of the Hulk, prepare yourself to see him as you never have before in a live-action film.",10,5,11,2 June 2012
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Isn't as fulfilling or exciting as the first or second entries
","Although it's been done before several times now, I can only imagine how hard it must be to decide exactly where to split a book in half to make it two or more movies. Most novels have a beginning, middle, climax, and an end. What can a filmmaker do to leave audiences feeling satisfied when there's no big payoff or conclusion to what they're taking in? Here is where the problem lies for 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1.'Katniss has brought down the Hunger Games. President Snow and his forces look to stomp out a revolution that could end his reign. Katniss reluctantly accepts her place as the symbol of freedom for the band of rebels quickly rising in each District. She must also find a way to save Peeta from certain doom as he's been captured and is being held in the Capital.'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' feels exactly like what it is. It's half a book and movie that leaves you starved for more. Many will say that's exactly what it is and I understand that. However, I've seen several other franchises do the exact same thing and it felt way more satisfying. 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' and 'Twilight: Breaking Dawn' immediately come to mind. Jennifer Lawrence is definitely one of the 'It' actors of the moment. I must say I was surprised at her performance in many of the more emotionally charged scenes in 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1.' It was as if she was having difficulties connecting with the character of Katniss Everdeen when it came to her crying or showing anxiety over the events she's dealt with. It was as if she couldn't find that place within her that helps to muster the tears or empathy it takes to appear convincingly tormented. As the series moves forward towards its epic finale, I'm impressed with how they expand on social issues we're dealing with in real life. The one that stood out to me in 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' was Finnick's revelation that the President uses the attractive tributes as sex slaves to serve his political purposes. Sex trafficking and slavery is something that's happening today in our own backyards and not many people know how serious or prevalent it is.With the continuing success of each film before it, 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' ups the ante when it comes to special effects and visual splendor. The CGI and what appear to be location shots are fabulous and lend an air of authenticity to the movie. Whether filmmakers shot more in actual settings or just utilized improved computer animation, the outcome is a grander piece of art.'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, some disturbing images, and thematic material. It's no more graphic than either of the previous films when it comes to battles. There are scenes of charred and burned bodies twisted in the ruins of District 12 which many might find uncomfortable. The only other warning I would give concerns Finnick exposing the President for using him as a sex slave. If you go into 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' knowing it isn't as fulfilling or exciting as the first or second entries in the franchise you'll be alright. Entering the theater with the expectation that you're watching the first half of a movie which will provide no sort of closure or satisfaction is your best bet. Maybe it does exactly what Lionsgate and Director Frances Lawrence wants it to do. It leaves you frustrated and wanting the rest of the meal immediately.",7,15,31,25 November 2014
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows' delivers quality thrills
","I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan. I read the abridged adaptation of 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' as a kid and was immediately addicted. I was then introduced to Basil Rathbone's movie version of the sleuth. Over the years, I've read a few of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short stories and loved them all. Unlike many Sherlockians, I had no problem with Robert Downey Jr. playing the character. I thoroughly enjoyed his unique, physically fit, and active exploits in Guy Ritchie's first 'Sherlock Holmes' film. Sequels can go south very quick. I was happy this wasn't the case here. That's not to say it doesn't have its flaws.The only real issue is the beginning of the film, where it feels like Ritchie is trying to front-load it a bit too much. The rest of the movie moves along at a good pace and keeps viewers riveted. Don't try watching this in a noisy room or while doing something else because it's way too complex and you won't be able to keep up.",8,1,1,12 June 2012
The Expendables 2," 'The Expendables 2' top first outing with bloody body count and cheeky humor
","When 'The Expendables' hit theaters, action enthusiasts didn't think it could get any better. Sylvester Stallone managed to recruit a majority of the action stars of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s in one movie. Not only did he accomplish this feat, but he constructed the perfect homage to the great action films of the 1980s which featured unapologetic, politically incorrect, and gratuitous violence that made many an adolescent boy and grown men alike smile from ear to ear. In 'The Expendables 2,' the newest member (Liam Hemsworth) of Barney Ross's (Sylvester Stallone) team is murdered in cold blood during a mission. Ross vows revenge on the criminal kingpin responsible - Jean Villain (Jean-Claude van Damme). The Expendables go on the hunt for Villain and foil his plans to recover a large amount of plutonium he plans to sell to the highest bidders. After the first movie was a box office success, it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. One question was how producers and writers were going to top the first film. A couple notable action film figureheads were missing from 'The Expendables.' Could Stallone and his crew possibly top their first outing with a second go-round? The answer to the question is a resounding yes. 'The Expendables 2' delivers all the action, violence, humor, and mayhem audiences expect from the familiar stars that appear in it. Many action movie fans left the theater after the original noting that Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris, and Steven Seagal were missing from the ensemble cast. They also felt a bit short-changed when it came to the brief appearances of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Have no fear, moviegoers. Van Damme and Norris are both in attendance this time around. Van Damme plays the main villain and relishes in it. Norris plays a sniper who flies solo but just happens to be everywhere he needs to be at all the right times to help Stallone's crew out of tight spots. Willis and Schwarzenegger make up for their lost time in the first movie by getting in on the main action in this one. Schwarzenegger transitions from the Governor's office to battlefield look effortless. He has no problem poking fun at himself while delivering his token phrases, whether it be 'I'll be back' or stealing one from Willis by exclaiming, 'Yippie kay yay.' I couldn't stop myself from grinning as he marched forward in a hail of gunfire while shooting an automatic weapon and jerking with each shot like he was working a jack hammer. There's no shortage of blood and gore. You can't miss the big splashes of crimson fluid splashing all over the screen. Body parts are blown off and keeping up with a body count is virtually impossible. It's everything you'd expect from a movie combining all the classic elements and players of action films from the past three decades. 'The Expendables 2' is a nostalgic piece of action movie fun. It has everything one could want in a genre piece of this kind. Two questions came to mind as I was leaving the theater. One was, 'How are they going to top this one?' and the other was 'Where was Steven Seagal?'",8,4,10,18 August 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' successfully melds horror, patriotism, and history into an energetic thrill ride.
","Ever since seeing a screening of Timur Bekmambetov's Russian masterpiece 'Night Watch,' I've made it a habit to watch anything the producer / director puts his stamp of approval on. Most everything he's been involved in I've liked or appreciated. His movie 'Wanted' is probably my favorite action vehicle of the last decade. It doesn't seem like anything in that genre can thrill me after witnessing all the unbelievable scenes and adrenalized energy emanated by that film. Even the movie '9,' which he produced with Tim Burton, was interesting even in its imperfection.Bekmambetov has hit gold again with 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.' Successfully marrying history with horror and vampire lore is risky business. Some people get very touchy when you start playing with historical figures and happenings. Original book author Seth Grahame-Smith wrote the screenplay, leading me to believe the final outcome is the way he wanted it to be. Obviously, Bekmambetov added the martial arts flavor to the mix.'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' is an entertaining movie that will have Americans cheering for their country while simultaneously enjoying some great decapitations and gore. I saw a screening of the film on Juneteenth and it really helped hit home the importance of what Lincoln did for the U.S. in a fun and unique way. Much like '30 Days of Night,' this is a return to the world of scary vampires. These bloodsuckers don't sparkle in the sun and quote romantic poetry. If that's what you're looking for, this isn't for you.",8,5,10,22 June 2012
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Perfect example of classic Walt Disney animation and storytelling
","'101 Dalmatians' is a perfect example of classic Walt Disney animation and storytelling. It has an air of elegance thanks to its English setting and characters. The unforgettable villainy and look of Cruella de Vil will forever be imprinted in the minds of children and their parents alike. It's a tale of family loyalty that cautions us to always be wary of other people's motives and greed. And of course kids will find the puppies cute as well.Dalmatian Pongo is tired of his bachelor-dog life. He spies lovely Perdita and maneuvers his master, Roger, into meeting Perdita's owner, Anita. The owners fall in love and marry, keeping Pongo and Perdita together too. After Perdita gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies, Anita's old school friend Cruella De Vil wants to buy them all. Roger declines her offer, so Cruella hires the criminal Badun brothers to steal them -- so she can have a fur coat.",8,2,2,16 February 2015
The Hunger Games," Entertaining yet mentally stimulating movie for teens and their parents alike
","With the end of the 'Harry Potter' saga and the 'Twilight' series about to wrap up, Hollywood is ripe for a new movie franchise to take their place. After several attempts, Lionsgate came out on top with this summer's highly successful 'The Hunger Games.' For those who live under a rock, the Hunger Games are an annual event that pit children from different districts against each other in a battle to the death. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Evergreen must rely on her training and archery skills to survive and return to her family. Her feelings for another competitor in the deadly Games complicate matters.Everything about this movie is thought-provoking. It also contains layers of social commentary which add to its allure for teens and adults alike. Is it violent and controversial? Of course it is. It wouldn't be as wildly popular as it is if it wasn't.Director Gary Ross does a wonderful job of capturing the animalistic nature and tragedy of the Games in a faux-shaky cam way that makes viewers feel like they're in the thick of the action. However, it doesn't cause you to want to blow chunks at the screen like 'Paranormal Activity' or 'The Last Exorcism' do.If you're looking for an entertaining yet mentally stimulating movie for teens and their parents alike, this will hit the spot and encourage them to discuss the themes explored in the film.",9,2,7,28 August 2012
Zootopia," Amusing and action-packed; the message starts feeling heavy-handed
","Disney's 'Zootopia' is an amusing and action-packed addition to their long history of animated classics. However, at times, the message of the movie does start feeling heavy-handed. We got it the first three or five times: you can do or be anything you want as long as you believe in yourself and go for it. There's also nothing quite like a wholesome half-dressed pop star telling our children to 'Try EVERYTHING', right? Aside from those two gripes, a great vocal cast and well-placed humor bring everything together quite nicely.'Zootopia' is rated PG for some thematic elements, rude humor and action. Judy Hopps is bullied by her classmates, which might disturb younger viewers or ones who are victims of that sort of abuse. Christians will be offended by the use of God's name in vain in a couple of scenes as well. Judy and Nick visit a nudist colony where animals don't wear clothing. The sequence might stir up some questions about what exactly a nudist colony is.",8,2,5,11 June 2016
Argo," 'Argo' is an exciting political thriller which will have you white-knuckled
","I don't usually go out of my way to see political thrillers. If I catch them on a lazy Sunday afternoon, I'll end up liking most of the ones I watch. 'Argo' is one of those movies I would have passed up watching had it not been for one catch. The idea of the government using the making of a fake space / fantasy film to free hostages from Iran intrigued me. Once again, I'm very glad I listened to my instincts and took it in.In 1979, six Americans are put in hiding by the Canadian Embassy when the U.S. Embassy is raided in Iran by militants. Everyone else in the building is taken hostage. The U.S. government decides to take the unconventional advice of CIA operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to get the six diplomats out of the country. He will enter Iran and smuggle them out as a group of filmmakers scouting for shooting locations for a fake science fiction / fantasy film entitled 'Argo.'Ben Affleck continues to surprise me. He's always done his own thing in Hollywood. He'll do smaller films playing less conventional characters like 'Dazed and Confused,' 'Mallrats,' and 'Chasing Amy.' The next thing you know he's taking the lead in blockbusters and popcorn flicks such as 'Armageddon,' 'Daredevil,' 'Pearl Harbor,' and 'The Sum of All Fears.' Affleck's had his share of stinkers and received some unwanted attention in the tabloids as well. What actor hasn't?One thing Affleck has done is prove he's a versatile talent in Tinseltown and isn't going away any time soon. He won an Oscar for his 'Good Will Hunting' script and continues to collect awards for 'Argo.' The movie is nominated for an Oscar for 'Best Picture' and it deserves the honor.'Argo' appealed to me in so many ways. I was born in 1972 and was completely caught up in 'Star Wars,' 'Star Trek,' and 'Planet of the Apes' fevers. A movie based in that time period about people making a fake sci-fi movie as a front to save hostages is captivating.Add to that the fact that award-winning 'Planet of the Apes' makeup artist John Chambers helped the government get the hostages out of Iran. I remember seeing the news broadcasts about the hostage situation as a boy, but I didn't understand what was going on at the time. The whole event is interesting to learn about.'Argo' is an exciting political thriller which will have you white- knuckled and gripping the edge of your seat. Director Ben Affleck did a great job keeping up the suspense and pacing in the film. Even though you know how it's going to end, you are still nervous for the characters as you watch. That's just good filmmaking in my book.",9,5,8,27 February 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," 'Star Trek Into Darkness' keeps frenzied pace of first movie; adds social commentary creator Rodenberry insisted on
","Remember that excited feeling you had when seeing 'The Empire Strikes Back' for the first time ever? How about that stunned feeling you felt when Darth Vader tells Luke Skywalker he's his father? That's the sort of feelings I walked away with after watching 'Star Trek Into Darkness.' I'm so happy I avoided all spoilers for it. I walked into the movie blindly and was so thrilled I couldn't stop smiling through the entire thing. After a terrorist attack on the Federation council, James T. Kirk sets out with the crew of the Enterprise in search of the man. The terrorist, John Harrison, has fled into Klingon territory. Kirk is ordered to take him out through the use of a torpedo. Kirk disobeys orders and travels into Klingon space to capture the terrorist and bring him back to Earth where he will stand trial for his crimes. However, a rogue Starfleet officer wants to take justice into his own hands and only Kirk and the Enterprise stand in his way.I've read a few of the reviews floating around out there and must say I agree with some of them. 'Into Darkness' is a true 'Star Trek' film. While the 2009 film was full of action and humor, it didn't have the social commentary Trekkies came to expect from earlier entries. That's not the case with 'Into Darkness.' What we get here is the best of both worlds. The action aspect of 'Star Wars' is still present, but it's coupled with the smarts 'Star Trek' is known for.There are so many fun little tributes to the original series in 'Star Trek Into Darkness.' What's crazy is none of them feel desperately forced into the story. Writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof peppered the homages throughout an already exciting storyline, which helped long-time 'Trek' lovers find something familiar to latch on to. At the same time, the references wouldn't leave someone new to the franchise wondering what's happening.My only real complaint with 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is the handling of the McCoy character. Writers took a funny habit the good doctor had in the original TV series and drove it into the ground. Every time we see McCoy, he uses some sort of metaphor to describe the situation. It starts to feel like the stale joke your buddy tells every time you see him. After the first ten times, it's just not funny anymore. How many different plays on, 'Dammit, Jim! I'm a doctor not a speed boat captain!' can you laugh at before it gets old?I was impressed with the CGI and special effects in the film. The movie looks beautiful and the actors meld seamlessly with their artificial backgrounds. There are times where the Enterprise looks a bit animated, but it's nothing to complain about.'Star Trek Into Darkness' is the movie die-hard Trekkies wanted to see in 2009. All the elements creator Gene Rodenberry wanted the show to have are present. However, it comes wrapped in a package that will appeal to a broader audience.",9,4,9,20 May 2013
The Babadook," Truly an exercise in psychological horror that must be seen
","'The Babadook' is an effective thriller which climbs inside your head and drags all your worst fears and insecurities to the surface. It will haunt not only your nightmares as some of the disturbing events take place in the 'safety' of the day.In 'The Babadook,' a troubled widow (Essie Davis) discovers that her son (Noah Wiseman) is telling the truth. He is seeing a monster that entered their home through the pages of a children's book. Together, they must fight to remove the sinister creature from their lives while they spiral more and more into insanity.Although I've heard complaints from some that they never really show the monster, I find that to be a part of the mystery surrounding 'The Babadook.' You only get fleeting glimpses of what the creature truly is. I see it as a combination of Dr. Caligari and a Spanish horror icon known as Coffin Joe. That's all I'll give away about its appearance.'The Babadook' is unrated but could hold an R. A sexually explicit scene with no nudity is found. It also includes violence involving a child. Many times the child is dishing out the violence. Frightening and intense sequences of the monster are guaranteed to frighten viewers. There's also profanity and the child is given a sedative to help him sleep. 'The Babadook' truly is an exercise in psychological horror that must be seen. It takes your worst fears and darkest thoughts and parades them on screen in front of you to deal with and work out. You could even call it a sort of extreme grief and parental therapy if you truly dig into the meanings behind the movie.",9,7,13,8 April 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America Returns to Face His Past and Take on the Winter Soldier
","Of all the mainstream Marvel super heroes, Captain America is my most cherished. His first adventure was hands down my favorite of the Phase 1 films. The classic WWII setting and epic feel is what captured my fancy. It was like an Indiana Jones movie blended together with the comic book world. It makes perfect sense, as it was directed by a guy who cut his teeth working with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Although it doesn't have the same historic flavor as its predecessor, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' still succeeds at being the second-best of all the Marvel movies up to now.Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) have continued to work for Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of 'The Avengers.' When it's discovered that the evil organization Hydra is still running strong and has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., Cap and Widow go rogue to help discover who the enemy plants are. They team up with the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and find themselves confronting a powerful assassin named the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) as they embark on their mission.Everything about 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' contrasts the hero's first movie. It takes place in the present day instead of the 1930s and 1940s. Cap has to deal with advanced technology versus the tanks and simple guns of the past. He's also immersed in a political world that's less cut and dry as it was in the good old days of World War II. The musical score is more modern and chaotic versus the symphonic patriotic-sounding orchestrations of the original.I can't say that there are any real surprises in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier.' It plays out exactly the way you think it will. The main villain is who you know it's going to be from the first sequence of the movie. However, it's still fun seeing everything unfold before you.Whether it's predictable or not, it's nice to see a movie attempting to deliver a strong and complex storyline along with its over-the-top action sequences. 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' gets an 'A' for effort across the board. I also give it props for being a game-changer. Things happen in it that will shake the foundations of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Marvel Cinematic Universe in general.The addition of Falcon as one of Cap's sidekicks is a welcome one in the hands of actor Anthony Mackie. You can tell he's genuinely excited and honored to be a part of the Marvel movie world. He takes the part seriously and pours everything he's got into the role. It also helps that he doesn't wear a red jumpsuit with wings attached to it. His suit in 'Captain American: The Winter Soldier' is much more advanced and modernized.It's pretty obvious in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' that they're setting up Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow character for her own film. I just can't see the idea ever getting off the ground. I could see her guest-starring in episodes of 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' where they explore her checkered past while she helps that team out on a few missions. I can't comprehend how the character could carry a full-length theatrical release.The special effects and CGI in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' look good for the most part. There are a couple scenes where human movements look a little sketchy. Overall, the real and the digitized blend well together.'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence, gunplay and action throughout. It also has some bad language sprinkled throughout. There's nothing here you wouldn't expect after seeing all the other Marvel movies.As 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' came to a close, I found myself wanting more. I was already anticipating its follow-up and felt anxious knowing I'm going to have to wait another couple of years before getting some closure to the story it left open-ended. 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron' will at least serve as an appetizer when it comes to our Star- Spangled hero. I want a third giant helping of the main course again, though!",8,2,4,9 April 2014
Interstellar," A lofty and complex commercial which urges us to look beyond our own world
","Not many directors these days have the lofty ambitions Christopher Nolan possesses. He goes against the grain of Hollywood more so than any other modern filmmaker. Even his 'Dark Knight' Trilogy wasn't as conventional as many would think a super hero movie would be. His latest endeavor, 'Interstellar,' pushes Nolan even further into the realm of exceptional and atypical storytelling.In the near future, Earth is plagued by a blight that is quickly wiping out all the natural resources left on the planet. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former NASA test-pilot and Engineer who took up farming when the world gave up on space exploration. After stumbling on to a secret base, he discovers that the supposedly dismantled space administration has been secretly looking for ways to re-establish humanity on another planet and save it from extinction. Cooper finds himself leading a crew of explorers on a perilous exploration beyond our galaxy for a world we can colonize and begin again on.The best way to describe 'Interstellar' is as Christopher Nolan's version of '2001: A Space Odyssey' for the ADHD generation. Unlike Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's 1968 classic, there's a whole lot more talking and human interaction. The action and drama moves at a quicker pace as well. The Nolan Brothers wrote the script and knew that a movie without dialogue that crawled along to its dramatic and existential climax wouldn't work for today's fast food multiplex audience.I applaud Nolan for his use of models and other practical effects versus today's CGI shortcuts. It gives 'Interstellar' an authentic look lacking in other science fiction and fantasy films today. The use of actual sets, locations, and props keeps the audience immersed in the movie and not constantly anticipating the next overly-synthetic orc or dragon walking into the scene and pulling you out of the cinematic experience.One thing that makes me laugh about 'Interstellar' is the way the characters refer to the intergalactic entity contacting humanity as 'they.' Not for one moment do the scientists and explorers take into account that it could be God. After all, the idea of God sending us messages and leading us anywhere is so much more ridiculous than aliens from another galaxy.'Interstellar' is rated PG-13 for some intense perilous action and brief strong language. Profanity goes beyond the usual expletives and includes the 'ultimate' bad word at one point. The movie gets stressful at points and could give younger (and even older) viewers bouts of anxiety. Some might also feel a sense of claustrophobia in certain instances.Although 'Interstellar' definitely contains some of the very same concepts and encourages humankind's exploration of space just like '2001: A Space Odyssey,' that's where the comparisons end. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's story is much more rooted in our sense of preservation than Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's complicated and inexplicable masterpiece. It's a lofty and complex commercial which urges us to look beyond our own world and regain the sense of wonder and curiosity we used to have when it came to the Universe that infinitely surrounds us.",9,0,4,12 November 2014
Pacific Rim," 'Pacific Rim' looks great but lacks everything else a movie needs to be good
","'Pacific Rim' is going to be a hit with fanboys all over the planet. It's the type of movie that they feel obligated to love because of what it's about and who made it. In this case we have a movie about alien dinosaurs (Kaijus) fighting giant robots (Jaegers) directed by Guillermo del Toro (filmmaker who most Comi-Con attendees think can do no wrong). Sounds like it should work on every level doesn't it? Yeah, well it doesn't!Alien monsters named Kaijus come up through a rift in the Pacific Ocean (Get it, 'PACIFIC Rim'). Giant robots steered by military officers are used to battle these ferocious extraterrestrials. Our military must join forces with the world's most annoying scientists to find a way to seal off the portal between our world and the dimension they come from.Let's start out my review on a positive note. The CGI in 'Pacific Rim' looks great. The aliens and robots blend very well with all their surroundings.And that's the only thing I can come up with positive about 'Pacific Rim.' As a whole, the movie is absolutely unbearable to sit through. It escapes me how sequences of robots and aliens fighting each other could be so uninspiring that I literally dozed off at points.The design of the Kaijus are completely unoriginal and nothing we haven't seen before in a dozen other sci-fi movies. The Jaegers are basically souped-up giant robots that resemble what we've seen in 'Power Rangers' dressed in 'Halo' armor. Booooring.Now we move into character development. The entire middle of the movie is one big, long, drawn-out attempt at developing characters we will feel emotionally tied to. I completely understand the writer's motivation for doing this.The problem is that every character in 'Pacific Rim' is so annoying you actually want them to die or exit the screen as quickly as possible. Add to this the fact that not a single one of the actors seem to give a crap about their stereotypical role in the film and you have a serious problem. In a nutshell, the acting is absolutely horrid.'Pacific Rim' is a tired conglomeration of clichés we've already seen in way better movies in the past. There are so many recycled ideas mashed up in it that you could almost put them down on a call sheet as bullet points. Character who lost his brother in a past battle and retired? Check. He's being called back into duty by his old military leader? Check. Military leader gets a chance to be the hero and sacrifice himself in one last battle? Check. Military leader gets to give long rousing inspirational speech just like the one the President gives in 'Independence Day?' Check. They're all here for your predictable enjoyment.Let's just call 'Pacific Rim' what it really is. It's Guillermo del Toro's failed attempt at making what he wished was his essential 'Ultraman vs. Godzilla' homage. As I was running out of words to use in place of 'unoriginal,' I came across several synonyms that describe this movie to a tee: dull, unoriginal, corny, heavy-handed, humdrum, ordinary, phoned in, stale, uncreative, unexciting, unimaginative, unimpressive, uninspiring, uninteresting, and uninventive.I'm giving parents a warning in closing. There's no way any child under the age of 12 will sit through 'Pacific Rim.' Absolutely nothing exciting happens for 45 minutes in the middle, at which time they will get uncontrollably antsy and beg you to leave. This won't bother you because you'll be ready to run out of the theater screaming by then anyway.",2,537,873,17 July 2013
Oblivion," 'Oblivion' pays homage to 1970s and 1980s sci-fi films while dragging it out of the dark and into the light
","Tom Cruise never ceases to amaze me. People can go on and on about his crazy behavior and couch-jumping antics all they want. The bottom line is the guy is a good actor and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. It's obvious he loves his job and goes to great lengths to do it, which includes doing his own stunts as much as a director or producer will allow. 'Oblivion' is another excellent example of Tom Cruise at his finest.The great thing is 'Oblivion' benefits from having Cruise in it but doesn't rest on that alone. It's a great movie with beautiful scenery, above-average CGI, and an interesting blend of several different plot lines from classic sci-fi films of the past. The story elements aren't breaking any new ground. However, director Joseph Kosinski's concept of taking science fiction into the daylight should be recognized as a step in a different direction.Jack Harper and his partner, Victoria, are the last remaining humans on the war-torn Earth. They're assigned to watch over powerful machines used to collect what's left of the planet's natural resources for use on a moon being colonized by the survivors of an alien invasion. As the job is wrapping up and it grows closer to time for them to leave and move on to their new lives, bizarre dreams and occurrences awaken Jack's suspicions about his mission and who he is.Most sci-fi films take place in a constantly dark world that conveniently helps hide any CGI limitations filmmakers might run into. Kosinski's 'Oblivion' embraces the light and no doubt made it a bit more difficult on CGI artists whose jobs it is to blend the animated images with the real. They did a good job for the most part and the movie looks breathtaking.It's interesting to see how Kosinski incorporated the stark whites and bubbly numbers of the 1970s and 1980s science fiction classics without making 'Oblivion' look aged. Any number of those films will come to mind while watching it. It's hard not to draw comparisons to '2001: A Space Odyssey,' 'Alien,' 'Outland,' and many others.The story isn't the strong point of the movie, although it shouldn't be looked at as a straight retread of anything before. It's more a conglomeration of several plots from different sci-fi movies of the past. There are key ingredients from 'Highlander 2,' 'City of Ember,' and any number of movies addressing the issue of cloning or an alien race's need of our natural resources for survival ('War of the Worlds,' 'Battle: Los Angeles,' and 'Independence Day').Cruise's supporting cast in 'Oblivion' includes Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, and Andrea Riseborough. Freeman plays the leader of an underground resistance in the same way he plays everything. He's the wise man who doesn't take crap from anybody. Kurylenko and Riseborough play the two women in Cruise's life. They portray their individual characters with convincing emotional ranges. The last thing I'd like to address is the musical score by M83. It sounds very much like the music heard in 'Tron: Legacy' by Daft Punk. The soundtrack here resembles 'Tron: Legacy' layered on top of Hans Zimmer's score for 'The Dark Knight Rises.' it fits the film's tone and enhances the viewing experience for the audience.'Oblivion' is an entertaining journey into a grim future that doesn't look as dark as most genre films make it out to be. There's no real lessons to learn here, except maybe don't trust anyone at face value. It's just a good old-fashioned sci-fi action piece with a bit of a twist and more emotional depth than we're used to from these types of movies.",9,4,8,30 April 2013
Man of Steel," 'Man of Steel' takes the Superman character in a different and exciting direction for the 21st Century
","Let's be completely honest going into this review. Both 'Superman Returns' and 'Smallville' rested on the concepts made popular in Richard Donner's 1978 movie. For all intents and purposes, 'Superman Returns' was a direct sequel to 'Superman II.' Brandon Routh completely channeled Christopher Reeve and while Kevin Spacey added his own flare to the role of Lex Luthor, he still fit into the same character mold Gene Hackman created. 'Smallville' had numerous cameos by the stars of the original films and set designs and music were even used for the hit TV series.'Man of Steel' does its very best to stand completely separate from anything done before. There are no glowing crystals, no familiar score, or anything visually reminiscent of the past five films we've seen. The Clark Kent we get here is one drifting around looking for the right opportunity to show himself to the world. He doesn't act clumsy, inept, or naïve. Instead, he's a working man who uses his powers when it's absolutely necessary and then disappears afterward. That's really the biggest difference in character portrayal you'll see between the Clark Kent / Superman of Richard Donner's and Zack Snyder's films.I have to give Director Zack Snyder and writers David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan credit for taking on the responsibility of rebooting the Superman legend. It's a task that could quite frankly destroy a filmmaker's credibility in the world of comic book movies and geekdom. Thankfully, all their hard work paid off with 'Man of Steel.'Instead of 'Man of Steel' just being another retread of the character's origin story, it revisits his past and childhood through flashbacks much like Bruce Wayne did in 'Batman Begins.' It isn't mapped out from start to finish like 'Superman The Movie.' This works perfectly for the fast pace Snyder and company chose to take. We're thrown directly into the action in the film and get the backstory as we move along.Although there are absolutely no direct ties to the 1970s and 1980s 'Superman' films in terms of the visuals, one could argue that 'Man of Steel' is an upgraded version of 'Superman II.' There are a couple of definite parallels between the two. General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his army first destroy Smallville, much the way they destroyed the little town in Richard Lester's 1980s classic. They then move on to Metropolis, where Superman dukes it out with Zod's cohorts. I also found it interesting that Superman mainly battles two individuals in Smallville. One is the female Faora-Ul (Antje Traue) and the other is an unnamed giant of a being that pummels our hero and tosses him back and forth through the town's streets. Comparisons could be made to Zod's partners-in-crime, Ursa and Non, in 'Superman II.' One thing that bothered me throughout the film was a seemingly lack of concern over what sort of havoc and destruction the battles between Superman and the Kryptonians were wreaking on both Smallville and Metropolis. It didn't seem like our super hero was giving much thought to who he might be injuring as he pummeled and pounded through buildings and other objects and they fell to the ground on innocent bystanders. I tried to explain it away in my mind that it was out of his hands and he was just trying to do his best to end the battles quickly with as little collateral damage as possible. All I can think about is a scene in 'Superman II' where Christopher Reeve is concerned with moving the action away from populated areas so no one is harmed.Hans Zimmer's score for 'Man of Steel' fits the movie's somber and explosive tones. However, it never grabs you the way John Williams' iconic theme for 'Superman The Movie' does. Instead of having a life of its own, it's really used primarily as an accent to what we're seeing on screen.The CGI and special effects in 'Man of Steel' are incredible. There were a few scenes on Krypton that still had that animated feel, but this is more than made up for in the incredible action sequences and battles in Smallville and Metropolis. I would almost go as far as to say that the boundaries of human interaction using CGI excelled with this movie. The fight sequences between Superman and Zod literally had me stunned with mouth ajar.I appreciated all the ties to Christianity screenwriters Goyer and Nolan brought to the film. I think Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster would have been pleased. We're talking about two guys who originally named the super hero's parents Mary and Joseph before they were changed to Jonathan and Martha.There are a few examples of this. Clark goes to a church to get advice from a priest while an image of Jesus Christ adorns the background. He basically states in one scene he found his calling after 33 years of searching, which was the age of Christ when he began his ministry. In another scene, he asks his earthly father, 'Did God do this to me?' He didn't question whether God was real, but insinuated that he knew He was there and wanted to know if He gave him his super powers. Of course, we also get the legendary arms outstretched as if he's on the cross as he dives back to the Earth to save mankind.'Man of Steel' successfully brings the iconic super hero into the 21st Century. With the relaunch of the entire DC Universe on the printed page, it was the perfect time to take Superman in another direction. It's a great foundation to build on and has a likable and believable actor in Henry Cavill to help carry it along for as many films as he and filmmakers want to make.",Null,2,4,15 June 2013
Lilo & Stitch," One of my favorite 'new' Disney classics
","In 'Lilo & Stitch,' a lonely Hawaiian girl looks to fill the void in her life with a pet she adopts from an animal shelter. Little does she know that she hasn't taken in any ordinary dog. What she's brought home is a mischievous alien who's an escaped fugitive from another galaxy. Can Lilo tame the little creature before he complicates life for both her and her sister?'Lilo & Stitch' is one of my favorite 'new' Disney classics. What's not to love about a terrorizing extraterrestrial that has no sense of self- control and acts like an untamed beast? Add to that his love for classic rock 'n roll and you've got the equivalent of E.T. on crack. The rotten little brat inside me loves the little monster with all my heart.The other reason I adore 'Lilo & Stitch' is because it's not littered with characters breaking out in song in awkward places. There's music worked into it, but they're believable parts like a dancing number, a surfing scene, and a couple of songs Stitch performs for people or dances to with Lilo. Let's just sum it up by saying this isn't a typical musical.",8,1,2,19 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Marvel's most popular superhero triumphantly returns in 'The Amazing Spider-Man'
","Let's be honest from the get-go. The question on everyone's mind when it comes to 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is, 'How is it in comparison to the three Tobey Maguire movies?' After all, it's only been five years since the last film in Sam Raimi's trilogy about the web slinging superhero. Forgive me if my review reads like a comparison chart, but isn't that what everyone is looking for? There's really no comparison between the two except the source material. While 'Spider-Man' was trying to be everything to everyone, much like 1978's 'Superman: The Movie,' this new version of the story is more geared to the teenage demographic. It's hipper and has an air of teen angst to it. If you've seen it, imagine 'Kick-Ass' but the hero of the story actually has superpowers. The Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) in 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a rebellious smart-mouthed skater kid who is also a genius. Tobey Maguire's take on the character was nerdier and straighter than what we get from Garfield. There's really not much to compare between the two. The tone of the movie is also more serious. Is the story as ironed out as Raimi's 'Spider-Man' or 'Spider-Man 2?' No, it's not. The structure of the film is three-fold. The first part examines the strange events surrounding Parker's parents leaving him with his aunt and uncle. The second part deals with Parker becoming Spider-Man. Thirdly, we get the superhero battling the Lizard. The first part of the film leaves a lot of unanswered questions in the end. The second part is well-done as we see Peter deal with his new super powers, put together his costume, and use his scientific smarts to make his web shooters. While all this is going on, he delves into a romantic relationship with Gwen Stacy which further complicates things. The Lizard sections of the film may frustrate some and leave them feeling a bit rushed and searching for more story. There's also a part where I was left wondering, 'Why did they introduce that situation and then completely drop the ball on it?' Most of the acting in the film is perfect. Garfield is a believable Peter Parker and emits the angst, nervousness, and excitement a teenager would feel in all the given instances he faces. Emma Stone does a wonderful job convincing us she is a high school genius and is very likable. Sally Field is a stronger Aunt Mae than we saw in Raimi's 'Spider-Man' series. Denis Leary plays a toned-down version of himself as a cop and father. The only weak point in performance is Rhys Ifans as the Lizard / Dr. Curt Connors. For the most part, he's good and pulls off the role. However, he goes a little over-the-top when spewing his crazy-talk at Spider-Man during their battles. The special effects and CGI in the movie look great. They're much better than the the first 'Spider-Man' trilogy. There were a lot of complaints directed at the effects and CGI when it came to the hero's aerial escapades in Raimi's films. Producers and the effects houses hired for this really stepped it up. The POV shots of him swinging through the city are brilliant. I thought the Lizard melded well with the live-action backgrounds and characters as well. The 3D was useless and unnecessary. It was well-utilized during some of the POV and wide shot web swinging scenes, but for the most part it really didn't matter. I found myself getting a little eye-fatigue in the beginning because of blurry background images. I haven't had that in a long time while watching a 3D film. Is 'The Amazing Spider-Man' a good movie? Yes, it is. I would recommend every fan of the superhero go see it. Put aside any skepticism and expectations you have because of Raimi's version of the character. It's better than those films in some ways and not in others. Three things it is for sure are endearing, heartfelt, and entertaining. Director Marc Webb obviously has a love for the source material. I can't wait to see where the story goes from here.",8,4,10,3 July 2012
The Lego Movie," A rousing good time for the whole family
","What can be said about 'The Lego Movie' that already hasn't? I think the millions upon millions of children singing the songs from the blockbuster sum everything up quite well. Warner Bros. Pictures and the Lego brand have most definitely hit pay dirt with a film that attracts not only rough and tumble boys looking to build something to knock it down, but even gentle little girls who dream of princesses and Uni- Kitties. The evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) plots to glue the Lego Universe together in permanent harmony. A construction worker named Emmet (Chris Pratt) is believed to be the 'Special' who will deliver the Lego world from the grasps of the tyrant. He teams up with feisty female Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Batman (Will Arnett), Superman (Channing Tatum), and other reluctant heroes to stop the oppressor and his minions.The film is rated PG for mild action and rude humor. Although some might say there's some violence, it's always meant to be lighthearted and never taken seriously. After all, they ARE only Legos. The only people who will have a problem with this movie are ones who don't like the violent silliness of 'The Three Stooges.''The Lego Movie' is a rousing good time for the whole family. It's front-loaded with enough juvenile humor to satisfy any child and packed with a sufficient amount of pop culture references to attract older audiences and members of the geek illuminati. The only thing you have to worry about is the annoyance you'll begin to experience from having your kids run around the house singing 'Everything is Awesome' day and night.",8,0,2,23 June 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Could've been better under Matthew Vaughn's direction
","When it was announced that Bryan Singer was returning to the Director's Chair for 'X-Men: Days of Future Past,' fanboys and girls everywhere squealed in excitement. Finally, the series was going back into the hands of the man who helped start the whole film franchise. I, on the other hand, groaned and wondered why 'First Class' helmsman Matthew Vaughn couldn't return to push the story further. It was my favorite entry in the series and took the bad taste out of my mouth created by the mess referred to as 'The Last Stand.'In the distant future, robots known as Sentinels have all but wiped out both mutants and humans. Wolverine is sent by the X-Men to prevent an event which will send history down this path to destruction. First he has to find a way to unite Professor X and Magneto in a search for the harbinger of doom - Mystique.My worries over Singer's return to steer the franchise were all realized after the first hour or so of 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.' The first portion of the film moves ahead and sets the viewer up for a powerful and epic thrill ride. Unfortunately, like most of the director's movies, it starts to meander and get tedious right after the halfway mark. The action and excitement gets bogged down in a lot of dramatic narrative which feels as if it was injected into the script to make the movie more analytical than it really needed to be.One thing I was pleasantly surprised by was the way the massive amount of cast members and the parts they played in the story were handled. I was concerned when it was announced that the original and new actors who portrayed their respective characters were going to be jammed into one movie. How in the world were filmmakers going to keep the movie from becoming overcrowded and derailing? Director Singer and Screenwriter Simon Kinberg handled the whole affair quite well. Instead of trying to cram as much of a pleasurable thing down our throats as they could, they worked towards the greater good of the whole. They didn't play favorites and shove certain popular actors into scenes just to give them more face time.'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is rated PG-13for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action, some suggestive material, nudity, and language. I've seen Hugh Jackman's butt enough now. Does it really have to be showcased in every one of these films?Although I did enjoy 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' to a certain degree, I felt myself getting lethargic as it moved along towards its inevitable climax. By no means is it a bad movie, but I think it could've been better under Matthew Vaughn's direction. I do give it props for fully embracing its science fiction roots.",5,2,3,10 October 2014
The Butterfly Effect," 'The Butterfly Effect' shows a different side of Ashton Kutcher
","Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) suffered from blackouts and memory loss most of his childhood. He keeps a diary of the events so he can read them later and remember what he did. After heading off to college, he begins to have the blackouts again. Evan soon realizes he has the ability to alter reality through time-travel. Directors / writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber created quite a thought-provoking and suspenseful movie here. It makes you think about your actions in life and the sort of repercussions they have on those around us. It's a disturbing reminder that the things we say and do really affect people. This was Ashton Kutcher's first real dramatic leading role and he handled it well. It can be hard to push the image of an actor's character out of your mind if it gets stuck in there. I think Kutcher's biggest obstacle was getting audiences to see him as anyone but Michael Kelso from 'That 70s Show' at the time. He succeeded in my opinion. http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",8,1,1,3 August 2012
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Another Overlong and Tedious Journey
","I really wanted to have a good experience going into 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. ' Ten minutes in, I realized it would not be the entry in the series that would change my opinion of the long-winded and over-stuffed franchise. It's more of the same sweeping scenes of walking, overlong action sequences, and bouts of mind-numbing dialogue that only a literature major or studied fanboy or girl could understand or even care about. Bilbo Baggins and a band of dwarfs follow the wizard Gandalf on a journey to reclaim a great kingdom conquered by a dragon. Not only has the dragon stolen their homeland, but he also greedily guards the dwarfs' treasures of gold and a mystical jewel. Orcs and elves try to stop the group every step of the way. Let me be the first to scream a couple of things from the mountain top and say what everyone else is too afraid to. First off, Peter Jackson is a liar. 'There is no desolation by Smaug in 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.' If you count him banging around and destroying the Lonely Mountain as desolation, I guess you could excuse the title away. I would consider that to be grasping at straws, however.Secondly, would somebody PLEASE stop Jackson from being allowed in the editing room when these movies are being trimmed and tightened up. It's very evident that Editor Jabez Olssen is working with a metaphorical gun to his head when working on both 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' films. ANYONE in their right mind knows there's at least 30 to 45 minutes of completely useless footage that could be chopped out of any of the films. Jackson should direct the movies and then all the footage needs to be taken away from him. He shouldn't be allowed to touch them after that.Jackson overdoes everything in 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.' He's one of those directors that takes a good thing and runs it into the ground. He's the wife or mother whose family tells her they love her pasta, so she makes it for them every day from then on.He knows we want to see Smaug. However, we don't necessarily want to watch him sneering and leering at Bilbo and the dwarfs for fifty minutes.This is the fifth film in 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' franchise. We get it. New Zealand is beautiful. You don't have to keep beating us over the head with long stretches of footage of people walking through the country over and over and over again.Here are the few things I can say positive about 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.' The special effects, for the most part, look great. However, they do devolve horribly in a scene where a gold statue is melting.Any sequences featuring the Necromancer are awesome. Interestingly, I was told that those scenes aren't even in the book.The first time you see Smaug is very impressive as well. Unfortunately, the novelty wears off after the first five minutes pass. Suddenly, you realize that the sequence with the dragon talking to Bilbo is going to be as tedious as the one in 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' where they quiz each for twenty minutes.There's nothing new to say about 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' that I haven't already covered in the past. It's long. It's tedious. There's a smothered hope that somewhere amongst the two hours and fifty minutes you invest is a good movie. 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' movies are both sources of frustration. Never have I been so ready for a film to be over, yet utterly frustrated by the way it ends. The 'desolation' in the new movie's title doesn't even happen. I really hate these movies! Why do I keep going to see them?!?!?",3,5,15,16 December 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," 'Wreck-It Ralph' will appeal to gamers but might lose steam with other viewers
","I don't play video games. Although I work at a store that specializes in movies first and video games second, I get the strangest looks from people when I tell them that. My first reaction is hand gestures that define how much of the store is made up of Blu-rays and DVDs in relation to video games. I didn't get the job there because of my love for video games. That's why I can't say I was all that excited when I saw the trailers for 'Wreck-It Ralph.'After 30 years of playing the bad guy in his own video game, Ralph (John C. Reilly) is ready to move on to bigger and better things. All he wants is to be accepted by the other characters of the game and be recognized as a hero instead of a villain for once. In order to prove he can be just as good as he can be bad, Ralph embarks on an adventure to other video game worlds to win an award and the respect of his associates. His journey pits him against the ruler (Alan Tudyk) of a racing game obsessed with keeping a glitching character named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) from participating.I'm more than positive that 'Wreck-It Ralph' pleases gamers with its homage to video games past and present. The characters are all charming and filmmakers did a wonderful job capturing the looks of different types of old and new games. The only thing I couldn't quite get over was why Ralph and Felix looked so new, but their companions from the 30- year-old game still stuttered a bit when walking and talking.One thing that impressed me was how animators found a way to keep the style of the different characters consistent while being from different games and decades. Each game had a unique look but still somehow fit together in the grand scheme of the film. A good example of this was the blending of the vastly different 'Hero's Duty' and 'Sugar Rush' worlds.The voice cast for 'Wreck-It Ralph' is an interesting mix of actors. Instead of the usual Disney TV stars and A-list celebrities we're used to, filmmakers dug a little deeper here. John C. Reilly ('Step Brothers') lends his voice to the title character while Jack McBrayer ('30 Rock') plays his nemesis, Fix-It Felix, Jr. Sarah Silverman ('Crank Yankers') takes on the role of mischievous racer Vanellope von Schweetz. Jane Lynch ('Glee') voices Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun from 'Hero's Duty.' It's quite a 'mature' casting choice for a family film, but it works.Although being a bit complex for younger viewers, 'Wreck-It-Ralph' will win children over with its mesmerizing animation and appealing characters. Its family-friendly fun which parents who used to play 'Pac- Man' and 'Super Mario Bros.' can find something humorous in as well. However, it might not have the same appeal to those who never played video games.",7,0,0,5 March 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' isn't nearly as tedious as anticipated; although it's still nowhere near perfect
","I'm not a huge fan of the three 'Lord of the Rings' films so my expectations were pretty low walking into 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.' I'm not saying that I don't acknowledge J.R.R. Tolkien's genius and the fact that the movies do look great. I just think that they could have been half the length in their theatrical releases, much less their extended editions.With all that being said, I must admit this wasn't nearly as painful to sit through as I expected. There was still plenty wrong with it, but it could have been much worse. Strangely, I can only think of a few reasons why the movie appealed to me; I just know that as I left the theater I knew I wanted to see it again.'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' tells the story of Bilbo Baggins and his adventure outside his comfort zone of the Shire in the wilds of Middle-earth. The wizard Gandalf and his band of dwarfs need a master burglar to accompany them on their quest to retake their kingdom from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way they run into a number of different obstacles including orcs, goblins, and a strange creature calling himself Gollum.Let's get the things I remember enjoying about the film out of the way first. I liked getting to see Christopher Lee as the very suspicious Saruman, even if it was only for a few minutes. I also was delighted to see Gandalf being a lot more active in battles; even if I knew it really wasn't Ian McKellen doing the fighting.The other two things I really appreciated were the Pale Orc and the story of the Necromancer. According to people I spoke with after the movie, neither the Pale Orc nor the Necromancer was even in the book. Basically, what I loved about 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' had nothing to do with its source material. The last thing I was thankful for was the limit of only two annoying folk-songs sung by the dwarfs.I was told that I shouldn't see the movie in 48fps and 3D as it would require me bringing an airplane barf-bag to the theater with me. I really had no intentions of seeing it in 48fps at all, but it was the only way I could at a time I was free. The negative aspects of 48fps are getting blown way out of proportion. It didn't make me ill the way I was told it would.The experience is comparable to watching a Blu-ray on a hi-def TV, but it's magnified onto a big-screen. That doesn't help when it comes to make-up showing on actors and things of that nature. It also caused scenes with fast movement to blur as well. It wasn't as bad as it was made out to be by people I spoke to before viewing it.I was very surprised by how bad the CGI in the film was. I would say that three-quarters of the CGI was absolutely dreadful. Everything from Rivendell to the smoke coming out of Gandalf's pipe reminded me that I was watching a movie mostly created on a computer. I wouldn't expect that WETA will be getting much business outside of Peter Jackson after other filmmakers see this.There were many points during 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' where I found myself drifting off. As usual, Jackson has a tendency to not know when enough is enough with lengthy scenes of landscape, mountains, and walking. He sure loves to watch people walk. The sequence where Bilbo and Gollum quiz each other was also a chore to get through.I know many people who had high expectations were let down by 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.' Maybe my lower expectations made the film seem more acceptable to me. One thing I will say is it's jam-packed full of Middle-earth facts and background information; so much so that at times it feels as if it's going to burst at the seams and spill out all over the audience. I definitely don't think we'll have to worry about any more movies after these three 'Hobbit' ones. Jackson will have nothing left to exploit if this first entry is an example of what to expect from the next two.",6,4,16,19 December 2012
Non-Stop," Liam Neeson embarks on a 'Non-Stop' Flight of Action
","At 62 years old, Liam Neeson has managed to carve quite a niche out for himself within the world of action movies. He's spent the last few years of his career fighting, jumping, shooting, and rescuing his way on to movie screens worldwide at a time when most stars would be settling in to nice quiet roles as an elderly statesman or wise old man. 'Non-Stop' sees Neeson fully embracing his hero side once again in a thriller that is equally parts mystery and thriller as it is disaster and adventure film.Bill Marks is a weary air marshal on another non-stop flight from the U.S. to Europe. His worst fears are realized when he receives text messages from an unknown person on the flight claiming they will kill one passenger every twenty minutes until their ransom demands are met. Now he must figure out who he can trust to help identify the sadistic individual before they strike.'Non-Stop' teams up Liam Neeson with 'Taken' Director Jaume Collet-Serra for another thrilling go-round at saving the day. Collet-Sera likes to helm movies that deal with controversial subject matter. It's obvious he wants people to walk away from his films not only entertained but with something to think and talk about.'Non-Stop' is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence, some language, sensuality and drug references. I can't think of a single moment of sensuality or drug references. Neeson enjoys his alcohol and smoking but I'd be hard-pressed to consider that 'drug references.'I would be lying if I didn't tell you that 'Non-Stop' does feel like an extension of 'Taken.' Liam Neeson's character might be a bit more hard- boiled, but he's in essence cut from the same pattern. If you can just get past that and enjoy a suspenseful hour or so of action movie clichés, get a first-class ticket for 'Non-Stop' excitement. Do you see what I did there?",8,1,3,14 June 2014
It Follows," Left wanting more in the horror department
","'It Follows' has become the most talked about horror film of the season thanks to rave reviews and a ridiculous amount of press from not only genre outlets but mainstream ones as well. With so much hype surrounding it, I deemed it necessary to drop everything and see it as soon as possible. As I left the theater, I couldn't shake the feeling that while what I saw was both engaging and thought- provoking it still somehow missed the mark of true terror.In 'It Follows,' a teenager (Maika Monroe) has disturbing visions following a strange sexual encounter. She has the inescapable feeling that someone -- or something -- is after her.I couldn't help but be intrigued with the premise of what has now become a juggernaut of a horror film. As a Christian who promotes sexual abstinence before marriage, the concept of 'It Follows' caught my attention right away. It's like taking one of the most important 'rules' of slasher films and really pounding it home.'If you have sex, you're going to die!'Several viewers will take 'It Follows' as a metaphor for the endless spreading of the AIDS virus through unprotected sex. Others might look at it as a warning that premarital sex never ends well. There's always emotional baggage we're left with after the experience. Either way, there's a lesson to be learned whether it was intentional or not.Is 'It Follows' actually THAT scary like everyone else says it is? Not really. Is there an ever-present sense of dread and gloom? I would say so. The main problem with the film is that you're expecting some over-the-top controversial ending thanks to all the hype the media is throwing at us. Sadly, I think most people will find the conclusion unsatisfying.Another issue I had with 'It Follows' is the way the horror is taken out of the lead character's head. At first, only she can see the evil coming for her and that provides a certain personal or first- person psychological appeal to the film. Once the 'entity' manifests itself to the others like a poltergeist, you start to feel as if you're just watching another typical supernatural thriller. The novelty of the whole concept just wears off during those segments.The movie is rated R for disturbing violent and sexual content including graphic nudity, and language. There was definitely way more nudity than there needed to be in order to get the point across. It's not sensual nudity, either. There's nothing attractive or stimulating at the flesh we see flash across the screen. The violence is gory and includes a few head shots and blood splatters.'It Follows' succeeds in its suspenseful set-up and establishment of an atmosphere of dread and panic. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver any real closure at its conclusion. Some will find this fitting, where others will leave the theater unfulfilled. I was caught somewhere in the middle of dissatisfaction and contentment. Although I enjoyed the basic premise and the unique blend of 1970s and 1980s nostalgia with present day technology, I was left wanting more in the horror department.",6,0,13,31 March 2015
The Little Mermaid," Great Family Movie
","Mermaid Princess Ariel wants to live up above the ocean floor in the world of humans. She makes a deal with an evil sea witch named Ursula and leaves the ocean for life on dry land. When things go array in both her beloved worlds, Ariel must enlist the help of her fish friend Flounder and crab Sebastian to set things right.It's become almost a monthly ritual to pull this out and watch it ever since my kids starred in a local stage play based on the movie.What can be said about 'The Little Mermaid' that already hasn't been? I think its award nominations and wins speak for themselves. Boys and girls of all ages adore this treasure. As stated above, it's even found life as a stage play performed around the world by children's and adult theaters.",9,4,4,28 September 2013
Frozen," Definitely not made for me
","There was a time in the early to mid-1990s when Disney started making animated movies without musical numbers. I can't tell you how relieved I was. I'm not a big fan of musicals at all. Do I like a lot of the classic films the Mouse House released early on? Of course I do. However, that's not to say I don't take a restroom break or frantically search for the remote to fast-forward through the songs in movies like 'The Jungle Book,' 'Cinderella,' and 'Sleeping Beauty.'Parents who share my aversion to musicals can now look forward to suffering through even worse tunes geared towards the pop-infected ears of tween and teens everywhere thanks to 'Frozen.' Before I go into my personal tirade against 'Frozen,' let me state something very clearly. Children and musical-loving adults will adore the film. Besides its new style of animation, this is a classic Disney outing through and through. There's a princess, a prince, an inanimate object that talks, the dumb peasant who deserves love, and a kingdom in the grips of fear and trouble.Without going into any spoilers, I will say that I was impressed with one plot twist that set 'Frozen' aside from other Disney movies. Since I'm reflecting on the good found, I'll also mention that the snowman Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad delivering his best impersonation of Jonah Hill I've ever heard) provided just enough comic relief to keep me on the inner edge of sanity.Let's take a moment to reflect on the incredibly annoying theme song 'Let It Go.' Where we once would get operatic and symphonic numbers, we're now cursed to slosh through a whiny pop track tailor-made to be played to death on top 40 radio stations for eternity. Entertainment Weekly's Marc Snetiker described the song as 'an incredible anthem of liberation.' Liberation from what? Being a cartoon character that freezes stuff with her hands? Just keep the gloves on and get over it!If you have kids who enjoyed 'Tangled' and 'Brave,' then 'Frozen' will give them something else to watch. Parents who loved those films will embrace this one as well. If you're like me, you'll find yourself darting out of the room every time someone turns it on.",6,1,4,19 March 2014
The Bourne Legacy," 'The Bourne Legacy' successfully gives action enthusiasts just what they need, but nothing more
","What do you do when the original director and actor of a successful franchise you're building backs out of the upcoming sequel that's already planned? It's really quite simple. You either replace the lead actor and continue on or you somehow shift the focus of the movie onto another character. How hard can it be to find a director to replace another when the series is already a guaranteed payday?Universal Pictures made good decisions all the way around with 'The Bourne Legacy.' Instead of concentrating on the character of Jason Bourne, they altered the center of attention to other agents affected by the Blackbriar and Treadstone programs. Enter Aaron Cross, played by newly established action star Jeremy Renner ('Avengers').Instead of just replacing Paul Greengrass with some other random director, they chose to go with someone very familiar with the series. Tony Gilroy co-wrote all the other 'Bourne' films and stepped in to helm and pen the latest entry. He did an acceptable job balancing these two enormous jobs.I love a great action movie. I also love a good spy thriller. It makes perfect sense that a movie like 'The Bourne Legacy' would appeal to me. For the most part it did. However, somewhere along the line a feeling of tedium set in. It didn't stick with me throughout the film. It just came and went. Sometimes I think I've seen too many of these types of movies and the excitement has worn off.One thing I really enjoyed about the film was the sense of realism director Gilroy captured. He doesn't lean on a crutch of CGI like so many of these action films do these days. It reminds me of the newer James Bond films. When you see Daniel Craig and Jeremy Renner jump onto the ledge of a building or cliff and slam into it, you know it hurt. You don't look at the scene and go, 'They used a miniature for that or digitally enhanced it.''The Bourne Legacy' does get bogged down at times with plot-pushing dialogue, but you can't really fault filmmakers for wanting to give the audience something with substance. Although it's a great outlet for people to see Jeremy Renner in a very physical action role again, I don't think this will be remembered as one of the better entries in the series either now or in the future. http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",6,0,4,7 January 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Successfully follows up the first chapter with tons of dizzying excitement, romance, and superhero fun
","I have to tell you that I had absolutely no expectations walking into 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2.' The trailers and teasers for the movie never pushed any emotional buttons for me. Although Marc Webb's second film in his series was looking to be overstuffed with villains, I never made any negative mental comparisons to Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 3' because I actually liked it.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). The constant reminder of his promise to Gwen's father (Denis Leary) makes it virtually impossible to keep a clear conscience while courting his high school sweetheart. Meanwhile, a timid worker (Jamie Foxx) for OsCorp is transformed into a dangerous electrical force bent on draining New York City of its power and gaining notoriety through his acts of terrorism. The wall crawler also finds himself going head-to-head with both the Goblin (Dane DeHaan) and the Rhino (Paul Giamatti) as they seek to satisfy their own diabolical agendas.It goes without saying that 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' sounds a bit hectic. The biggest question on everyone's mind is if the villains all feel jammed into the movie. The answer is yes AND no. There are times when it feels like the characters were shoe-horned in to make way for the much-talked about 'Sinister Six' movie. At other points, everything feels cohesive and not forced. Harry's transformation in particular seems a bit hurried, but not enough to ruin the viewing experience.I've heard grumblings about 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' being considered nothing more than a gateway or segue way to the 'Sinister Six' and 'The Amazing Spider-Man 3.' I did get that feeling at times. There was an underlying vibe I could compare to 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' and 'Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones.' They existed because they had to in order to bridge the gap between two other pieces of an epic puzzle.I will say that some of the dialogue and acting in 'The Amazing Spider- Man 2' lacked. Dane DeHaan seemed a little out of sorts at times with his performance as Harry Osborn. Surprisingly, Jamie Fox did a great job adding humor to his character of Max Dillon/Electro. There were spots where his dialogue veered into corny territory as well. It's hard to blame dialogue problems on anyone but the writers, though.'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action/violence. There was also some bad language. If you and your children were fine with the first movie, this is really no different when it comes to content. It gets a little intense at times, but my seven year old handled it well.As far as sequels are concerned, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' successfully follows up the first chapter with tons of dizzying excitement, romance, and superhero fun. Although it feels a little overloaded at times, in the end it captures the essence of what comic book fans crave. It's a summer blockbuster with intentions of being taken seriously at the same time through elements of human drama and teen angst.",8,1,6,7 May 2014
Lincoln," 'Lincoln' is a brilliant film demanding multiple viewings to take it all in
","I've been fascinated by Abraham Lincoln my entire life. I'm sure it has to do with the fact that he was assassinated and there's quite a bit of mystery and intrigue surrounding his presidency and personal life. He did so much in his terms in office and changed our nation for the better while overcoming all sorts of political opposition. I knew I would need to see Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln' as soon as it was announced in production.'Lincoln' focuses on the man's obsession with getting the 13th Amendment pushed through Congress before the Civil War ended. Abe was honest, but would see his mission of obliterating slavery accomplished by any means necessary. His drive and the toll it took on his family life are explored in great detail.Director Steven Spielberg takes what could have been a disastrously boring two and a half hours of non-stop dialogue and somehow makes it engaging and tolerable. The success of the film is based around Spielberg's casting of Daniel Day-Lewis in the lead role. Day-Lewis owns every moment he's on screen and demands your attention with every word he speaks. He's merely the cherry on top of a brilliant and dedicated cast that includes James Spader, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Fields, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, John Hawkes, David Strathairn, and many more.Although they only took up a few moments of screen time, the scenes of the Civil War battlefields bore a lasting impression on me. The savageness of hand-to-hand combat was hard to watch. These soldiers fought hand-to-hand, which made it more personal. It wasn't a faceless war like today's, where we just drop bombs on each other and never have direct contact with the people we're fighting.The fact that I stayed awake through two and a half hours of talking is a true testament of how well-paced and captivating 'Lincoln' is. I'm really not one for talky and long-winded movies, but Spielberg's devoted obsession with the historical figure and Janusz Kaminski's masterful cinematography make the movie stand out and demand your undivided attention. It's a movie that requires multiple viewings, as there is so much being said so quickly that you're guaranteed to miss something important.",10,1,4,25 March 2013
Big Hero 6," A perfect movie to launch a new franchise for both Disney and Marvel
","Disney has another hit on their hands with the big-screen adaptation of Marvel Comics' 'Big Hero 6.' They've accomplished exactly what producers set out to when scouring through the unused properties of the mighty publisher. Filmmakers took a forgotten super hero title and attempted to give it a new lease on life.Prodigy Hiro Hamada and an inflatable robot named Baymax have developed a special bond with each other. The city of San Fransokyo suffers a devastating event that jeopardizes the safety of its citizens. Hiro joins forces with his friends adrenaline junkie Go Go Tomago, neatnik Wasabi, chemistry whiz Honey Lemon and fanboy Fred to form a team of high-tech heroes called 'Big Hero 6.' Together they must uncover the mystery of who's to blame for the damage which has befallen the great city.'Big Hero 6' is filled with likable characters who contribute something to the team. Each one has their own unique look and attitude towards their heroic actions. Every child in the audience will find something in common with one of the different members of the group.The visual concepts for 'Big Hero 6' are breathtaking. The city of San Fransokyo is a clever mash-up of its namesakes. It's a futuristic metropolitan bringing together American and Japanese culture which doesn't seem all that far off from where we're headed in the real world.The animation of 'Big Hero 6' is a clever blend of Disney's signature CG look with an anime flavor injected into it. It's a smart move at a time when younger kids are into Asian movies and shows like 'Fairy Tale,' 'Pokemon,' and Disney's distributed Studio Ghibli properties. The combination of styles is a perfect way to attract a broader audience to the film.The unofficial 'mascot' of 'Big Hero 6' is an inflatable robot named Baymax. His design is based on real world technology doctors have started using to treat patients that are sensitive to the touch. They take this idea and run with it as the lovable Baymax believes his teammates to be patients he needs to take care of and keep safe.'Big Hero 6' is rated PG for action and peril, some rude humor, and thematic elements. All of these minor issues aside, it's a great movie for the whole family to enjoy together. I'm sure some younger children will find certain points scary for them. They might be frightened of the main villain's mask and look as well.Everything about 'Big Hero 6' points to it being a perfect movie to launch a new franchise for both Disney and Marvel. I find it strange that Marvel has gone out of its way to visually distance itself from the movie. You can't find a logo for the company anywhere in it. A surprise appearance in the post-credits scene definitely cements the comic book publisher's imprint onto the film, even if it isn't through the use of the familiar fanfare seen at the beginning of every live-action Marvel movie.",8,2,20,7 November 2014
Brave," Disney and Pixar's 'Brave' satisfies
","As I begin this review, I should confess I'm not a big Pixar fan. Although I do recognize the charm the films hold, I don't find them as entertaining as most people do. Much of that has to do with the animation style. The environments look great, but I find the human beings to resemble lifeless marionettes many times. The atmospheres of the movies are too 'cute' for me as well. I'm not big on 'cute' when it comes to animated movies.All that being said, Disney and Pixar's 'Brave' is as good as their films come. It has all the right elements of a classic fairy tale with a few twists thrown in to keep things modernized. There's a princess, a witch, and some kooky animals in a faraway land.The only thing missing is a prince to save the day. Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) makes it very clear to her parents that she doesn't need a prince to fulfill her life's ambitions or save her. She wants to live life on her own terms free of the trappings and responsibilities of being royalty.Merida stumbles upon a witch (Julie Walters) that gives her a spell to change the Queen's (Emma Thompson) mind about marrying one of three suitors from other clans. The spell does more than change her mother's mind; it physically transforms her into the most feared creature in the kingdom - a gargantuan bear. Merida frantically looks for a way to change the Queen back before her father (Billy Connolly) and fellow huntsmen track her down. They mistakenly believe her to be the bear that took the King's leg.In usual fashion, there are lessons for everyone to learn in 'Brave.' One is children should be careful what they wish for and value their parents. The other is that parents should give children the freedom to choose their own paths in life. It wouldn't be a Disney or Pixar movie without some sort of words of wisdom.'Brave' is successful as a whole. I'm glad I gave it a chance after skipping it in theaters. The initial marketing campaign for the movie offered no real motivation for me to see it in theaters. I did get a bit frustrated during the climax with some of Merida's illogical decisions. The different settings in the film really do carry you away to a fantasy world and help put you into the middle of the story and action.",7,4,7,14 November 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is pure unadulterated sci-fi fun!
","Although I'm not a big Marvel Comics fan, I have no problem admitting that they've found a successful formula for their cinematic universe and stuck by it justifiably. After testing the waters with the 'Thor' movies and 'Avengers,' they've fully committed to the genre and jumped into science fiction territory with 'Guardians of the Galaxy.'Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) was abducted by intergalactic mercenaries moments after his mother died of cancer. He grew into manhood searching the universe for valuable items to sell to different collectors of all species. After finding a mysterious orb, it seems like everyone in the known galaxy is hunting him down to take possession of it... including the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin). Quill puts together a team of misfits to keep the object out of the villain's deadly clutches.Director / Writer James Gunn has captured the magic of 'Star Wars' and mashed it together with the Marvel Universe to give audiences an exciting experience they won't soon forget. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is shameless sci-fi gusto with a healthy shot of humor along the way. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy it. The CGI work for 'Guardians of the Galaxy' takes the viewer to so many unusual worlds and leaves you believing you're really there. There were a few spots that took me out of the experience, but I was sucked back in almost immediately. Everyone interacted with the CGI characters and blended well with them on screen. Chris Pratt looked like he was having a little trouble talking to an 'X' in early scenes in the film, but he comes around quick enough.The 3D for 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is even well-done. There aren't random items constantly jumping out at you off the screen. It simply and successfully used to give the picture depth, which is very rare. Most movies really don't make good use of it or completely go overboard. Each actor in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' fully embraces the character they are portraying. You can tell they love what they're doing on screen and are happy to be a part of the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe. Bradley Cooper's voice is unrecognizable as Rocket Raccoon, but definitely shows a range many wouldn't imagine the actor tackling. Chris Pratt is as sarcastically charming as he always is as Peter Quill / Star-Lord.Guardians of the Galaxy is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for some language. I found it interesting that through most of the film, the good guys use shock guns that knock out their enemies like a more powerful Taser. Of course people die, but it seems like the movie is steered in a certain way to make it appropriate for all ages. There are some sexual innuendos, but nothing graphic. The scene in the trailer where Zoe Saldana is taking off her shirt with her green back to the camera isn't even in the film that I remember. There are so many Easter eggs within 'Guardians of the Galaxy' for die- hard Marvel Comics fans to look out for. I don't want to spoil anything, but keep your eyes open for a few different treats. Chances are if you blink at any given moment, you'll miss one of them.'Guardians of the Galaxy' is pure unadulterated sci-fi fun! Marvel has delivered their version of 'Star Wars' for a new generation. It's going to make people want more from its characters and seek out the adventures found in the comic books. I would consider it to be one of the best entries yet on the ever-growing list of Marvel movies.",8,2,4,1 August 2014
Evil Dead," 'Evil Dead' gives gore fans what they've been waiting for by leaving nothing to the imagination
","The day Sam Raimi fans have been either anticipating or dreading for 30 years is upon us. The remake of 'Evil Dead' has taken over theaters. Most enthusiasts of the original horror trilogy wanted another sequel. That's definitely not what we get in this gore fest.Don't expect dancing decapitated corpses, funny one-liners, and other slapstick elements found in 'Army of Darkness.' You'll be gravely disappointed. What we get here is full-on blood and guts with a dash of more blood and guts.There are no college kids heading up to the woods to party for the weekend this time around. Setting a serious tone from the very beginning of the film, a group of old friends come together to help one of their own kick a drug habit. The plan is to keep her locked up and restrained in the family cabin until the girl is fully detoxed. She's relapsed once and they're going to make sure it doesn't happen again.While cleaning up the old place, the bunch stumble on what appears to be an old book bound in a plastic bag by barb wires. One of them opens it and begins reading the words inside. By reciting the ancient sayings, they release a long dormant evil that takes possession of them one by one. As the friends begin dying, they frantically search for a way to bring an end to the demonic force.I am very impressed with the depth of the story here. It would be so easy to go down the stale 'kids going to a cabin to party' route again. Although the acting is wooden at times, the characters are a bit more noble and sympathetic than the usual dumb college types we get in these types of movies.There's no end to the visual gore in 'Evil Dead.' From the very beginning, the viewer knows what they're getting into. They're going to see it all in full color. This isn't the usual PG-13 jump-scare fiesta we've come to expect from today's horror movies. Brace yourselves to see arms and legs get hacked off and gallons of blood dripping in puddles everywhere. I cringed and gritted my teeth just thinking about the pain during most scenes.If there's a message to 'Evil Dead,' it's really quite simple. Don't screw with demonic forces or read magic incantations or passages out of an evil book. All you're doing is asking for trouble with a capital 'T.' Whether you think it's silly or not, I'm a firm believer in this advice.I enjoyed the dual finale of the film. It had a happy ending while leaving the audience with a warning that evil never really goes away. It's just left waiting for some other poor soul stupid enough to give it a means to be reborn.If you've been waiting for a movie to come along and satisfy your taste for graphic violence and gore, 'Evil Dead' will quench your thirst for blood. Those looking for pure 'Hitchcockian' suspense with a 'less-is- more' attitude when it comes to horror movies need not purchase a ticket for this one. Stay after the credits to see a 'groovy' surprise!",7,8,68,5 April 2013
Paranormal Activity," 20 Minutes of Cheap Parlor Tricks and 50 Minutes of Padding
","Where to begin, where to begin. My first question is since we voted Paranormal Activity into a wide release in theaters, is there a way that we can vote it out? I haven't felt this let down by a film in a very long time. We're talking let down by epic proportions. I was so completely disappointed, I almost wanted to stand outside the theater door and warn people going in to save their money, don't believe the hype, go trade your ticket in for Zombieland. I can't believe I'm saying this, but wait a week and go see Saw VI. It has too be more entertaining than this.Before I go on, let me get the one good thing about this movie out of the way. It won't take long, believe me. The movie does serve as a warning to people to not mess with the supernatural and occult which, in my opinion, is a very good position to take on the subject. A lot of movies make it look fun to play around with the occult and such, but this is definitely not one of them.Now, on to the rest of the film. I guess I'll just start from the top and move down the list. I may have to abridge some of this since if I actually went into what all is wrong with this movie, I would have to start another website. We begin with the filming technique. The shaky cam is something that was first used as a horror gimmick for film in The Blair Witch Project. This film wishes it was The Blair Witch Project. Never mind the comparisons - it truly WANTS to be that film. I'm over it. Done with the shaky cam crap. I'm tired of leaving the theater feeling like I want to go blow chunks on the director. It was cool the first time. But to keep making movies like this for me to watch is like asking me to keep riding that roller-coaster that I know is going to make me want to barf half-way through it.I don't know why Oren Peli is being praised for this thing. All he did was walk around with a video camera and shoot stuff. There is nothing even remotely artistic about this. You set a camera up in the corner of a room. People get in bed and out of bed. You use some cheap parlor tricks to make doors move and have somebody downstairs banging stuff. Wow. Now that is art. The rest of it is shot like a home movie, just focusing on a room or a certain person.What you get with this film is 20 minutes of footage that has some very quick scares and then 50 minutes of people talking about what's going on. Honestly, I would have felt better and been more entertained if they would have just released the 20 minutes of bed footage and been done with it.Scariest movie ever or of the year? I think not. This entire film is made up of cheap thrills and loud bumps to make you jump. It's like that bad remake or rip-off of The Exorcist you accidentally rented off of Netflix last week. The only people who will be scared from watching this movie are moviegoers who are completely unfamiliar with horror films and do not go see them regularly. I mean real regularly. There's no way if you've watched even two scary movies this year that this thing would get more than a cheap momentary jump out of you.Paramount and everyone involved in this thing has done quite a number on the public. It makes me wonder if this wasn't planned from the very beginning. That it was somehow orchestrated from the get-go. All I can say, I got taken. If you don't feel like you've gotten taken when leaving the theater after seeing this, then they've truly done a number on you. I walked out not believing that renowned websites that I rely on for my movie news have actually been promoting this thing as truly scary and brilliant. Has everyone bought into a big lie? Not me. I do have to applaud Oren Peli, though. He has somehow taken an $11,000 heap of film project and used it to rise to the stature as of being the director of The Blair Witch Project of the 21st century. We saw how well that panned out for the original directors of that film.",2,8,15,17 October 2009
Avatar," Avatar from the eyes of a once skeptic
","Alright. So I was wrong. Let's just get it all out in the open right away. For six months I've been bagging and busting the chopping of Avatar. Well, last night I saw it the way it was meant to be seen – in IMAX 3D. Was it good? Yes. I wish I could say that this has taught me a lesson – don't bag on movies before you see them – but I'd be lying if I said I'll never do it again. It's the human nature of anyone who is into movies and I'm sure that I'll fall victim to my own idiocy again more sooner than later. Alright, let's move on to the review.Avatar really does look great. The landscape of the planet Pandora is very rich in detail and you can tell that James Cameron spent hundreds or thousands of hours going over every aspect of its design. If you have a good level of suspension of disbelief, you can literally get lost in this film and feel like you're there. You can definitely still tell the Na'vi are CGI when you see full body shots of them, but amazingly close-ups of their feet and hands look almost frighteningly real. The other thing that was kind of creepy was how real the close-up head shots looked and how from different angles, you could see the actors' actual features in their avatar's face. It really was amazingly well-done. My only other complaint is that some of the animals still had a shiny CGI look to them that distracted you from fully being immersed. The mix of actual real actors, machinery, and CGI came off without a hitch.The acting started out a bit forced, which I believe had something to do with the dialogue possibly. Even veteran actor Sigourney Weaver was having trouble pulling off the lines. It almost seemed like they started to settle into their roles, which is pretty much impossible since the film I'm sure was shot out of sequence. Sam Worthington did a great job in his role as Marine Jake Sully. Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch was a bit over the top and times, but still quite a bit of fun. Michelle Rodriguez was basically just your typical Michelle Rodriguez tough-girl. I'm not a tech head, so I don't know how much of the actual actor you see on screen, but Zoe Saldana did a great job making the different emotions of her Na'vi character, Neytiri, quite believable.Now, let's move on to the story. It's pretty much recycled from any other number of films like Braveheart or even The Alamo. You know – the small guys fight against the odds and in the end win because of their big hearts and belief in their cause. It gets to be a bit overwhelming and heavy-handed because you've got that aspect (which obviously is meant to be a mirror image of the uprooting and treatment of the Native Americans) mixed with an environmental message, and then Cameron even throws in some New Age Mother Earth mumbo-jumbo to further push his obvious agenda. It all gets to be a bit overbearing. Apparently, Cameron felt that this was his platform to let us all know his world view on politics, the environmental plight, and spirituality. Which is fine, since he spent some twelve years on this thing and it's obviously his big baby of a movie? The 3D filming was very well-done. It wasn't too in-your-face and was used quite well to accent and give depth to the scenes for the most part. There were some parts that were a bit hard to focus on and seemed a bit cluttered, like some of the chase scenes and such. I have to say that if you don't see this in 3D, you're pretty much wasting your time. It's most definitely not going to have the same effect in 2D and is going to lose quite a bit.Overall, I have to say that I'm glad I gave the movie a chance and went to see it. I was originally so stupidly against it after I was disappointed in the Avatar Day footage that I wasn't even going to see it in the theater. That would have been a mistake. It's a fun and entertaining film. It gets a bit intense and dark at times with the destruction of the Na'vi's home. Just be prepared to be force fed James Cameron's beliefs while you're enjoying the visual eye candy and munching your popcorn. You're going to hear what he has to say, whether you like it or not.",8,0,1,14 January 2010
Mama," 'Mama' is a satisfying horror tale that demands multiple viewings
","The first time I watched 'Mama,' I walked away disappointed. For some reason, the special effects looked extremely artificial to me. That was my only real complaint, but it hindered my enjoyment of the film.As I was getting ready to write my review, I had this nagging feeling I needed to watch 'Mama' again. Rarely do I watch a movie twice in such a short period of time, but I was drawn to give it another chance. I can't begin to tell you how glad I am that I did.Two little girls stumble upon a cabin after a car wreck. Five years after their disappearance, they're found and taken into custody by their uncle Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel. The two bring the children into their home and attempt to give them a normal life. As bizarre circumstances unfold, Annabel starts to get the feeling something sinister has accompanied the girls and is 'protecting' them.For the most part, director / writer Andrés Muschietti adheres to the saying 'less is more.' We get quick and creepy glimpses of the supernatural entity. As the movie moves along, we are given longer and greater detailed glances at her. What looked very CGI the first time I took it in proved to be more convincing and practical at second look.I found 'Mama' full of great moments of genuine thrills and chills upon giving it a second chance. You'd think a horror movie you've seen before wouldn't hold as much tension when watching it again, but that's not the case with 'Mama.' It had more of an effect on me the second time around.Every actor in the movie is convincing in their role. Jessica Chastain transforms from a 1960s blond southern belle into a black-haired punk rocker incredibly well. The girls are absolutely phenomenal and their authentic reactions to the events occurring to them are noteworthy.'Mama' isn't going to satisfy gore hounds with its 'less is more' approach and lack of gore. However, Gothic horror enthusiasts and those who love a good ghost story with substance will thoroughly enjoy this. It's a creepy suspense-filled tale that you'll find yourself wanting to watch multiple times.",8,0,1,6 May 2013
Sinister," 'Sinister' takes the best of every horror sub-genre and blends them together
","I've been interested in the work of Director / Writer Scott Derrickson since hearing he was a Christian many years back. I was fascinated to find someone else who shared not only my basic religious beliefs but also had a passion for the horror and science fiction genres I love so much. It's not often you hear of Christians who are successful in Hollywood.Derrickson has an impressive resume of films and actors he's worked with over the years. His early endeavors consist of writing 'Urban Legends: Final Cut' and directing and penning 'Hellraiser: Inferno.' He moved on to take the helm of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' and 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose.' Both of these films starred well-respected actors like Keanu Reeves, Laura Linney, and Tom Wilikinson. His latest film 'Sinister' ranks at the top of his filmmaking career.True crime writer Ellison Oswald (Ethan Hawke) gained notoriety ten years ago with a book about a grisly murder. After a couple unsuccessful novels, Oswald is looking to repeat his success and return to the top of the bestseller list. He takes up residence in the home where the victims he's investigating actually lived and were killed.While moving in, he discovers a box of Super 8 movies which hold footage of several brutal murders that he believes somehow tie together. As Oswald digs deeper into each crime, his world begins to crumble around him. Is he losing his sanity or is there a supernatural force out to get him and his family?'Sinister' is the culmination of everything good about several horror sub-genres. You have the 'Paranormal Activity' found footage concept covered through the use of the Super 8 films. People who enjoy movies with supernatural entities like the ones in 'The Grudge,' 'Boogeyman,' and others of that nature will enjoy it. Those who crave modern day ghost stories like 'The Pact,' 'The Apparition,' and 'Insidious' will love it as well. There really is something for every type of horror enthusiast in 'Sinister.'The movie isn't a sloppy hodge-podge of those movies, either. Derrickson ties everything together with a script that makes sense and a story that is well-paced and intriguing. It has slow-burning suspense and jump- scares combined together to keep you on the edge of your seat and nervously awaiting the next disturbing scene.'Sinister' is a satisfying horror film which will appeal to many types of fright fans. It's a successful combination of old and new tricks. When it comes to what we see on screen, it has more in common with Hitchcock than it does gorier fare like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and the likes. Viewers who like a twisty storyline which leaves something for your imagination visually will enjoy 'Sinister.'",9,2,3,1 March 2013
The Witch," A great psychological thriller that sets itself apart from the mainstream jump-scare horror films
","'The Witch' is one of the most bizarre and disturbing coming-of-age movies I've ever seen. It's definitely not 'Sixteen Candles' or 'Pretty in Pink.' The characters in those films may have their share of problems, but they're nothing in comparison to the ones the family members in 'The Witch' are dealing with! In 1630 New England, panic and despair envelops a farmer (Ralph Ineson), his wife (Kate Dickie) and four of their children when youngest son Samuel suddenly vanishes. The family blames Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), the oldest daughter who was watching the boy at the time of his disappearance. With suspicion and paranoia mounting, twin siblings Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson) suspect Thomasin of witchcraft, testing the clan's faith, loyalty and love to one another in 'The Witch.'There are so many different viewpoints you can watch the movie from. Christians might see it as either blasphemous or cautionary. Satanists consider it be an encouragement for people to look outside the box of conventional religious beliefs. Others will see it as just a modern folk tale warning of unhealthy family dynamics and the dangers of isolationism and paranoia.Is it a cautionary tale warning of the dangers of playing with the occult and Satanism? Does the movie encourage audiences to explore life outside the 'confines' of Christian religions? Is it warning us to always question our beliefs and not just follow the herd? Honestly, it could be any of these. As a Christian, I find the ambiguity in the message of 'The Witch' to be slightly dangerous for those not grounded in their own faith. You're led to believe one thing through three-quarters of the film, even if the family members are extremely fanatic. Suddenly, the direction we're traveling in seems to switch gears.'The Witch' is rated R for disturbing violent content and graphic nudity. Much of the nudity is shadowed, blurred, or an old lady. I'm not defending it, just further explaining. Some of it is of oldest daughter Anya Taylor-Joy. She is underage in the film, even though in real life she's now 20. None of it is meant to be sexual in any way. 'The Witch' is a great psychological thriller that sets itself apart from the mainstream jump-scare horror films we're getting right now. It's a thinking man's fright fest that leaves viewers pondering what it's all about. Great acting, authentic-looking sets and wardrobe, and real shooting locations make everything feel even more authentic.",8,8,15,19 May 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," Although the concept has been re-visited a few times, the movie succeeds in creating something entertaining
","There are a few things you can gather from a list of Tom Cruise's films. Obviously, he likes being the lead man and hero who saves the day. Second, he loves doing his own stunts and getting in on the serious action. Thirdly, the guy seems to hold an affinity for science fiction.Sprinkled throughout his career, you'll find films like 'Minority Report,' 'War of the Worlds,' 'Oblivion,' and even 'Vanilla Sky' which touch on sci-fi and fantasy elements. The only butt he seems to like kicking more than those of international spies and government traitors are aliens. He returns to the screen right after saving the world from otherworldly invaders in 'Oblivion' to meeting them on the battlefield in 'Edge of Tomorrow.'Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is a military spokesman talking up the public during a world war against alien invaders. After being literally dropped into the middle of combat, he is killed almost instantaneously. Cage awakens to the harsh realization that he is trapped in a time loop and forced to die over and over again. Each time he returns from the dead, his skills are increasingly sharpened and he is one step closer to saving the world with the help of a Special Forces soldier named Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt).Director Doug Liman ('The Bourne Identity,' 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith') does a great job taking Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth's action-packed script and bringing it to the big-screen with all the intensity and excitement you would expect from a sci-fi / action flick. It's well-paced and takes itself seriously while injecting elements of dark humor into the equation.Tom Cruise is his usual lovable self and delivers a performance that reflects his love for these types of roles and movies. You can sense his enthusiasm for his work every day when he hits the set. He's a guy that acts for a living and doesn't hate a single second of it. I know many people can't stand Cruise, but you can't deny the guy's a good actor and seems to genuinely love what he does.Emily Blunt is perfect in the role of tough-as-nails Special Forces soldier Rita Vrataski. She's the Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in the 'Alien' movies) or Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff in 'Battlestar Galactica') character for 'Edge of Tomorrow.' She definitely holds her own next to Cruise as they partner up and make their way through packs of deadly aliens.'Edge of Tomorrow' is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language, and brief suggestive material. Cruise drops an 'F' bomb, although I'm pretty sure the 'ck' is cut off by an explosion. The rest of the language is pretty much what you would expect from a film that takes place in the military and on the battlefield. The battle scenes are pretty intense and I'd suggest leaving younger kids at home.If you're thinking 'Edge of Tomorrow' sounds like a science fiction mash-up of 'Groundhog Day' with 'Starship Troopers,' you're not far off- base. Although the concept has been re-visited a few times, the movie succeeds in creating something entertaining. This is accomplished through a great cast, some humorous moments, and action that keeps the story moving forward at a smooth stride.",8,2,4,2 June 2014
Dark Shadows," Good... but not as good as it should have been
","Is 'Dark Shadows' as good as it should be? No, it isn't. A rather uninspired plot line and missed opportunities at really amping up the horror and supernatural scares keep the film from being an A-rated movie. It seemed like Burton was playing it safe. He wanted it to be supernatural and scary, but not so much as to frighten away average viewers and jeopardize his PG-13 rating. I was also surprised by the sexual situations in the film. There's a couple parts that went a little too far in my opinion.Fans of 'Dark Shadows' will no doubt like the film. They won't love it by any means. I don't think anyone will be offended by the campy humor thrown around. I found the movie to be an acceptable update of the original television series. It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, but entertaining nonetheless.",8,4,11,12 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes," Downey Jr and Law are perfect!!!
","I love Sherlock Holmes. I have loved Sherlock Holmes since I was about 9 years old. I remember staying up late at night reading the abridged version of The Hound of the Baskervilles and being mesmerized by the story, illustrations, and characters. That led to a healthy appetite for the original Basil Rathbone / Nigel Bruce '30s and '40s films that I would stay up late on Friday and Saturday nights to watch. Man, I even have a newspaper that was in print at the same time that Holmes 'existed.' I have a framed collage hanging on my office wall that features pictures of the guarded doorway to 221B Baker Street in London, a wall painting and Holmes silhouette tiling in the subway, and a card that has the actor who plays Holmes onstage's signature (of course, he signed it 'Sherlock Holmes'). I also love the '80s film Young Sherlock Holmes. So when it was announced that Guy Ritchie was doing an adaptation of the famous character, I was very excited to say the least.Sherlock Holmes is everything a fan of the character could ever want in a new adaptation of the legend. It's adventurous, dark, mysterious, and humorous. It remains absolutely faithful to the original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories while taking a chance and expanding on some aspects of the character such as physicality, the way his mind works, the curse of his mental 'gifts,' and his drug use to obviously try to slow down his overactive and over stimulated psyche. It shows the back story of the character and delves into his personal world.I can't even begin to say enough about how well Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law work together. The chemistry between the two is unbelievable and something that I would compare to catching lightning in a bottle. Robert Downey Jr's English accent is beyond unfaltering and you never once doubt that he is channeling the very character that Doyle would have approved of taking right off the page. Jude Law plays the straight-laced and grounded Dr. Watson the way you would expect him to be – gentlemanly and calmly skeptical of the situations he finds himself in.The story is pretty well put together and you really don't know what is going on until the very end. It has a kind of similar dark tone and subject matter like Young Sherlock Holmes, but isn't an exact replica or copy of the story. The pacing is a bit off and there are a few lulls in action here and there, but it's for the sake of the storytelling.My only real complaint about the movie is the characterization of Irene Adler in the film. She really is tossed around and bossed around like some helpless and defensive woman, which is completely contrary to how you would think that Holmes' would act. It wasn't Rachel McAdams fault at all. She did what she could with what she was given to work with.Guy Ritchie really is on to something here. This movie could be the jump start to a whole new franchise. It would be a shame to see the Downey Jr. / Law chemistry put to rest with this first film. There is so much more story and ground that could be covered. We just have to hope that this doesn't end up getting lost in all the post – Avatar hype and the holidays.",9,0,2,14 January 2010
The Conjuring," 'The Conjuring' has everything you could want in one supernatural film
","'The Conjuring' is my favorite type of supernatural horror film. It has deeper meaning to it than just getting people scared. Everything about it is top shelf solid quality horror. I also applaud any movie that makes people think about the reality of God and the Devil.The Perron family is terrorized by what they come to believe is a spiritual presence in their home. Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren come to the family's aid and discover that it's not only haunted but dwelled in by the demonic spirit of a witch who cursed the land she was hung on. Can the Warrens find a way to rid the house of the evil before it takes a tragic toll on the Perrons?Although it's based on actual events, everyone knows 'The Conjuring' has been sensationalized for a movie-going audience. That doesn't change the fact that it demands its audience ponder the existence of a spiritual world outside of the physical one we can see, touch, hear, and smell. It also makes a point of letting you know that just because you don't believe in something doesn't mean it's not real.The biggest scares you'll get from 'The Conjuring' aren't even necessarily the ones you'll see and hear on screen. I found myself more frightened after the film ended. I was left thinking about it in the 'real' world. That's the beauty of a great horror film - it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.Let's just call it like it is. 'The Conjuring' is the 'Amityville Horror' of this decade. There's a lot of speculation around the Amityville house, but it's famous and put this movie's paranormal detectives in in the headlines and on TV. This is a story so fascinating that you don't want to believe it. However, somewhere in the back of your head you know it's true.'The Conjuring' is rated R for sequences of disturbing violence and terror. There's no nudity in the film. Some bad language can be found as well.Many Christians and religious folks will no doubt disagree with demonic possession being used as a vehicle for entertainment. I look at it as an opportunity to expose and educate a generation of people who have come to believe in nothing and just live life the best they can in spiritual darkness. I know that's pretty heavy thinking put into what most look at as a horror movie.'The Conjuring' has everything you could want in one supernatural film. There's the old creepy house, demons, ghosts, a hanging tree, a freaky doll, and so much more. I can't think of a single genre item it missed. The funny thing is, it doesn't feel over-stuffed or like it's going to burst at the seams. It's just a good old-fashioned supernatural thriller that will entertain and make the audience ponder it well past the closing credits.",9,0,1,18 October 2013
Prometheus," 'Prometheus' Provides Little Satisfaction as a Pointless Prequel to 'Alien'
","Walking out of the press screening for 'Prometheus' I couldn't help thinking to myself, 'This is what I've been waiting almost four years for?' I filled out my questionnaire, gave it to the Fox representative, and walked away telling my fellow movie reviewers goodbye. I stated that I hoped I could have a better day after it started out being ruined by a morning filled with disappointment delivered by Ridley Scott. I could sum up my review of the film in one sentence: Lower your expectations. 'Prometheus' felt tired to me. It was a conglomeration of recycled ideas and nostalgic bits and pieces spread out so 'Alien' fanboys and girls could look over at each other and wink while watching it together. Fanatics of the franchise will be 'in on' the subtle and not-so subtle references to the original, while others who never saw it won't be 'lost.' That being said, the only viewers who should be surprised by anything that happens in this movie are those who never experienced 'Alien.' 'Alien' enthusiasts need to see 'Prometheus.' Although it's pointless and disappointing in the grand scheme of things, it was mildly interesting to see the events talked about in the original film played out in front of me. Just don't go into it expecting for the film to break new ground or terrify you the way 'Alien' did in 1979.",4,2,5,8 June 2012
Halloween," It's always a pleasure to re-visit Haddonfield
","It doesn't matter what time of year it is, any time you watch 'Halloween' it becomes October 31st for an hour and a half. It's always a pleasure to re-visit Haddonfield and spend a little more time with Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, and all her friends.Does 'Halloween' really need any introduction? It might not be the first slasher film in horror history, but it's certainly the one that jump- started the genre and is still being imitated today. After the image of Michael Myers' famous white William Shatner mask hit screens, things were never the same. Suddenly, every psychotic in these types of films was covering their face using gimmicky guises. We've seen every sort of mask cover the maniac's identity, including hockey, gas, jester, cherub, and firefighter.'Halloween' captures the time period and small-town feel of its setting so perfectly. Anyone who lived through the late 1970s and trick-or- treated as a child in a suburb can attest to this. If you happened to grow up in Illinois like I did, the movie hits home even more. Honestly, Director Carpenter couldn't have done a better job establishing a believable atmosphere for this suspenseful and thrilling masterpiece.",9,5,7,26 September 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," 'The Dark Knight Rises' closes out Nolan's Batman trilogy in spectacular style
","I can finally say my day has come. No longer do I have to sift through supposed story leaks and speculate what could happen in Christopher Nolan's last chapter in his Batman trilogy. Dallas press has now seen 'The Dark Knight Rises.' Everybody wants to know if the wait was worth it. I'm happy to say I walked away pleased with the outcome. As much as I would love to put a synopsis for the movie here, I don't want to spoil one single little plot point or moment of your personal experience viewing it. I'll say this much and leave well enough alone. Batman battles Bane and it's awesome! Catwoman is involved as well. That's all the details you're getting from me. Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan, and David S. Goyer penned an emotional and complex final act. Just to give comic book geeks a little extra hint at what to expect, imagine the Batman story arcs 'Knightfall,' 'No Man's Land,' and a slight sprinkle of 'Gates of Gotham' all mashed together. Things get a little sluggish about 30 minutes in when the story is being developed, but I can't complain. At least the writers care about a story. One thing I can say about 'The Dark Knight Rises' is it's an emotional journey. I found myself excited and anxious at parts. Other scenes left me with a feeling of sorrow. It's also an emotionally confusing film. Things I thought I wouldn't be alright with going into the theater I ended up feeling good about walking out. The first appearance of Batman in the film is one of those scenes where you can barely contain yourself. You want to jump out of your seat yelling and clapping your hands. I was in a press screening and there were a few people clapping when he makes his grand entrance. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane is spot on and frightening. He's not just a crazed psychopath, but one with a mission and purpose. He's Batman's strongest adversary when it comes to strength. Bane's not all brawn and no brains, either. It takes an intelligent mind to pull off the things he does. One thing I want to make perfectly clear is he's in a completely different class than the Joker. There's really no comparison between the two. Anne Hathaway does a great job with the character of Catwoman and Selina Kyle. She can turn the charm off and on like a faucet. One moment she's an innocent bystander and the next she transforms herself into a skilled and arrogant jewel thief. The rest of the cast delivers in their individual parts. Gary Oldman returns as Commissioner Gordon and pours his heart and soul into the character the way he always has. Joseph Gordon Levitt is perfect as officer John Blake, who believes in Batman and stands behind Gordon in his call to keep the streets of Gotham clean. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is the movie Batman enthusiasts are hoping for going into it. There's no possible way that any fan of the Caped Crusader will walk out of the theater without a smile on their face. A few cameo appearances by characters also add more fun to the movie. It serves as an excellent bookend to Christopher Nolan's wildly popular trilogy.",9,28,57,17 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Utter disregard of the source material
","Wow I don't even know where to start with my review of 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.' Zack Snyder and the rest of his filmmaking crew have truly shown his utter disregard of the source material when it comes to at least Batman in this heaping mess of a film. We have a rather listless and mopey Superman mixing it up with a trigger-happy Dark Knight who goes against everything he ever stood for in the canonical comic books he's based off of. They're all angry and they're just not going to take it from Jesse Eisenberg's over-the-top annoying and crazy-on-the-surface Lex Luthor.It's been nearly two years since Superman's (Henry Cavill) colossal battle with Zod (Michael Shannon) devastated the city of Metropolis. The loss of life and collateral damage left many feeling angry and helpless, including crime-fighting billionaire Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck). Convinced that Superman is now a threat to humanity, Batman embarks on a personal vendetta to end his reign on Earth, while the conniving Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) launches his own crusade against the Man of Steel in 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.'I honestly don't know who to blame here for everything wrong with 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.' Is it Director Zack Snyder for not just saying no to all the many terrible ideas he saw when he read the script? Or is it Writers Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer who deserves to carry the heavy load of failure dumped on audiences.Let's get the good out of the way first, since that's the easiest. There's not much to write home about when it comes to 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.' Not in a positive light at least. Ben Affleck plays a great Bruce Wayne and Batman. When he's not riddling people's body's full of artillery holes, he's brooding, grim, and tough just the way he's supposed to be. He has no mercy on the villains and doesn't care if they live or die as he makes his way to righting the wrongs they're doing. He'll be great in a solo movie not bogged down with the refuse he's surrounded himself with in this atrocity.Also, Gal Gadot does a great job bringing DC's first lady of comic books to life on screen. I wouldn't go as far as to say she steals the scenes she's in. However, Gadot does hold her own among the big boys and even saved their hides a few times. She'll definitely help get females (and fanboys) fired up for her solo outing.I'll also go on record saying that the CGI and other effects weren't a problem for 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.' They were a bit shaky at times and could've been better. Overall, they weren't a distraction and blended well with their surroundings.Apparently, no one involved in 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice' has ever read a single issue of Detective Comics or Batman. The evidence is shown in the fact that he has the Dark Knight using all sorts of shooting instruments and artillery to KILL people. I'm not talking about like in Tim Burton's 'Batman,' where he would use bullets or exploding bombs to remove objects out of his way or scare his enemies. He actually killed people with them. Anyone with ANY passing knowledge of Batman knows he wouldn't do this.The Lex Luthor we get in 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice' is NOT the Lex Luthor we're given in the comic books we all know and love. Jesse Eisenberg's wacko, unmedicated and juvenile depiction of the character is so annoying you practically pray for him to leave the screen whenever he shows up. He's like a spoiled rich kid with power who accidentally is smart.I don't want to get into spoiler territory here, so let me be as vague as I can be. Everything you think or can imagine based on what you've read as a comic book fan, either passing or hardcore, happens just the way you fear it will. There are NO surprises to be found at all. Not unless you just know the names of these characters and have never seen a single animated or live-action film based on them in the past. I wouldn't say the script is absolutely terrible. Worse, it's just bland and predictable.'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice' is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action throughout, and some sensuality. A lot of people get killed in the movie - most of them bad guys. It might also disturb some younger children to see their favorite superheroes duking it out when they're supposed to be buddies. There's also a bit of profanity used here and there. The only sensuality I can think of is when Lois in the bath and they keep almost showing her breasts, but either cutting away or moving the camera up just in time to keep us from seeing anything. Still trying to figure out what the point of that was.Is 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice' the worst superhero film I've ever seen? No. Although I didn't hate it, the newest incarnation of 'Fantastic Four' still holds that honor. If I had a close second, this would be it. I will say it offends me more than that movie because of it's blatant disrespect for the creators and source material it's based on. You can kick dirt in the face of the Fantastic Four or any other Marvel character out there, but don't start soiling the images of my beloved DC icons.",3,9,18,29 March 2016
The Emperor's New Groove," One of my favorite Disney animated movies
","Kuzco is the selfish emperor of the large Incan kingdom. His scheming adviser, Yzma, turns the self-absorbed king into a llama to gain control of his throne and become its new ruler. The transformed Kuzco awakens to find himself banished from his royal city. He must join forces with a villager named Pacha to regain his leadership and find a cure that will turn him back into the man he once was.'The Emperor's New Groove' is one of my favorite Disney animated movies. It features an all-star voice cast including David Spade, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, and the late Eartha Kitt. Each one of these actors gives their characters depth and successfully brings them to life. This launched enough audience interest to convince Disney to make a direct- to-DVD sequel and a television show.There's some great humor found in 'The Emperor's New Groove.' Of course, we get David Spade's sarcasm and wit. Patrick Warburton keeps audiences laughing in delight as he plays the 'no brains - all brawn' henchman of Yzma named Kronk. It also helps that the movie isn't a musical. There's some musical numbers, but the character's don't stop dead in their tracks and start bellowing out a song every five minutes like many of the classic Disney films.'The Emperor's New Groove' is a great tool to help teach children the importance of thinking about how your actions affect others. It also shows how selfishness can cloud your judgment and hurt people. Disney continues to find entertaining ways to tell a tale of morality and be enjoyable at the same time.",8,1,2,1 July 2013
Blade Runner," 'Blade Runner' still one of the greatest sci-fi films of all-time
","Watching 'Blade Runner' is an emotional investment no matter how many times you see it. I don't know if it's the lighting, the music, the dialogue, or a combination of all of the above. How a science fiction film from 1982 can still have that effect on me after seeing it dozens of times is beyond my comprehension. I always come away from the film with my insides all mixed together with sadness, excitement, and that warm feeling of happy nostalgia you get when you experience something you never thought you could again.No matter what version of the movie you watch, they all tell the same story. In the year 2019, a group of organic robots called replicants kill a ship full of people while escaping an interstellar trip and head to Earth. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is hired to hunt the fugitives down and destroy them. Deckard is what is referred to as a 'blade runner' - a special police officer that 'retires' replicants when they wander back to Earth where they've been banned.I've seen 'Blade Runner' in many different environments and formats. I've seen it on VHS on a 25-inch television. I had the opportunity to see it on the big-screen a couple of times at revival screenings. I've watched it on a 50-inch flat screen in a regular DVD format. I can wholeheartedly tell you that if you haven't seen this amazing piece of cinema history on Blu-ray in its restored 'Final Cut' version then you've never properly viewed it.Each version of the film has something different to add to its viewing experience. There are different endings, additional footage, and even a monologue by Harrison Ford that tells you everything you need to know (and many fans would say some things you shouldn't) to help explain what's happening throughout. I suggest watching every version of the film to truly appreciate and take it all in.Douglas Trumball's special visual effects are a step beyond stunning. The use of models and practical effects gives 'Blade Runner' a realistic look that filmmakers today using CGI only wish they could achieve. Everything from the architecture of the buildings to the designs of the vehicles still influences designers to this day.",10,1,4,14 November 2012
Cinderella," Good movie, but where's a true element of evil?
","When people talk about Disney Princesses, Cinderella is the first one that comes to mind. Although it's obviously targeted to a female audience, there's enough humor found in the antics of the mice, the cat Lucifer, the Prince's father, and his assistant to keep male audiences at least mildly entertained for the movie's 75-minute runtime. This is an exceptional fairy tale film, although a true element of evil like a witch or a sorceress who can turn herself into a dragon is sorely missed. Evil stepmothers just don't hold the same peril for me as something supernatural.After her father dies, Cinderella is left to the mercy of her stepmother. The wicked lady puts her stepdaughter to work as a servant. She cooks and cleans after the vile stepmother and her two daughters with a constant fear of being cast out of her own home. The Prince of Cinderella's homeland puts on a ball to find a wife. He demands the attendance of all the maids in the kingdom and the poor girl sees an opportunity for a temporary escape from her miserable day-to-day routine. Unfortunately, the depraved stepmother and her daughters have plans to keep Cinderella from attending the ball and meeting the Prince.http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",7,1,2,8 October 2012
The Purge," 'The Purge' is a well-paced and violently disturbing film that will viewers with something to think about
","From the moment I saw the first trailer for 'The Purge' and read its synopsis, I knew I had to see it. The concept was so frightening yet intriguing. One thing's for sure. No one will leave the theater and immediately forget the film. I'm willing to bet many audience members will reflect on it for the next couple of days.In the year 2022, crime and unemployment are at an all-time low in the United States. It's a wonderful time in the history of our great country. However, freedom and prosperity don't come without a price. To keep order, the government has sanctioned one night a year for citizens to 'purge' themselves. During this twelve hour period, all crime is allowed and the emergency services and police are off-duty. This is an opportunity for people to get their aggressions out any way they need to, whether it be looting, murdering, or some other means.The Sandin family (Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, and Adelaide Kane) is spending the night of the Purge barricaded inside their high-class mansion. The home's intricate security system is nearly full proof. When the Sandin's son (Burkholder) sees a man (Edwin Hodge) begging for his life in front of their house, he opens the door and lets him in. Unfortunately, the group seeking their would-be victim want to 'purge' and will stop at nothing to get the man back from the Sandins and punish the rest of the family for helping him.Writer / Director James DeMonaco does a great job leaving you stunned, disturbed, and frightened all through 'The Purge.' The very idea that the U.S. could sanction such an event is terrifying. What's even scarier is how the people in the movie just accept this yearly activity as the norm. They believe it's for the greater good of mankind and the country.The scenes of violence range from gang wars to office killings and, of course, home invasions. The group that attack the Sandlins can't be more than eighteen years old. To see these kids commit random acts of violence to relieve their stress is unsettling. Some die very horrible deaths themselves because of their gruesome deeds. At times, I didn't know whether to cheer or feel sorry for them as they met their ends.Many people see a movie's running time and judge it by that. If it's less than ninety minutes long, it's under suspicion and usually labeled a dud. 'The Purge' is the perfect example of a film that's just as long as it needs to be at eighty-five minutes. For the most part, it has good pacing. There's a spot in the middle of the movie that felt dragged out a little. However, once the action and terror kick into gear it's a non- stop roller-coaster of a ride.It's evident what drew Producer Jason Blum to 'The Purge.' He's one of the guys responsible for the 'Paranormal Activity' movies. Most movies he's involved with feature some sort of surveillance or found footage and this is no different. 'Dark Skies' had security cameras in all the rooms. 'The Bay' was filmed with everything from news cameras to iPhones and home video cameras. 'Sinister' featured 8mm home videos.Blum hit the jackpot with 'The Purge.' Not only does it have surveillance and security cameras, there's a remote control car whose passenger is a doll with a spy camera lodged in his eye. This little contraption rolls back and forth throughout the house looking for the bad guys and lost family members. I have to admit, it's a pretty ingenious way of fitting some type of 'found footage' into the movie. It's getting to the point where every time I see the Blumhouse Productions logo, I spend the entire movie waiting for surveillance and security camera footage to pop up. It's like anticipating Stan Lee's cameo in whatever the latest Marvel movie is.There's a little something for everyone in 'The Purge' if you enjoy a good action or horror flick. We get some great fight scenes, quite a bit of tension and suspense, and some effective jump scares that will leave you breathless. Though it has its flaws, the movie works as a combination of entertainment and social commentary in the end.",8,2,6,6 June 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' is Engaging Overall, but Slips into Retread Ground
","The much-anticipated follow-up to 'The Hunger Games' arrives in theaters and many wonder if it lives up to its hype. With a new director taking over for Gary Ross, it's only fair that many have reservations as to whether or not 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' can live up to the high expectations of audiences and critics. I, for one, feel that the movie succeeds in entertaining and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats (if they haven't read the book already, off course).The celebration of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) proves short-lived after their victory in the 74th Hunger Games incites rebellion in the Districts of Panem. The two find themselves drafted into the 75th Annual Games, where they must battle all the past victors. Dubbed the Quarter Quell, it's part of a scheme the President (Donald Sutherland) has hatched to rid the world of the winners of the Games and put an end to the rebellion which could change the very way of life he's helped to establish.Director Frances Lawrence ('I Am Legend,' 'Constantine') makes the world of Suzanne Collins' beloved novels his own with 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.' Gone is the shaky cam vibe felt in Gary Ross's original film. It's replaced here with steady and sweeping camera work that gives the audience a third-person perspective of all the action and drama.Let me be clear from the get-go. I haven't read 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,' so my response to what unfolded on screen comes from that perspective. That being said, I found the first half of the movie to be highly engaging and entertaining. A lot of time is spent developing the story and characters and setting the mood for the film.The second half of the movie takes us into more familiar territory. I don't want to say that it becomes predictable, as new scenarios are introduced and experienced by the characters. However, I couldn't shake this strange feeling of 'been there, done that.'The special effects and CGI for 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' are impressive. The actors blend nicely with the digital backgrounds and creatures. I can't think of a single time that I was mentally pulled out of the film because of shoddy craftsmanship.All the actors do great jobs in 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.' Surprisingly, the only one that loses some credibility is Jennifer Lawrence in a few of her highly emotional crying scenes. She looks like she's having a little trouble connecting with her character's feelings of sadness and despair at some points. It's amazing how easily Stanley Tucci slips into the role of the overly charismatic and hilarious Caesar Flickerman.'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' is rated PG-13. Obviously, we get a lot of violence. A few bad words are uttered as well. There's also a scene where one of the victors of the Hunger Games strips naked in front of an elevator full of people, but nothing graphic is shown.Although it slips into ground already tread in the first film, 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' merits the admission price to see it on the big screen. It builds up a captivating story and leaves you wanting more at the end. While it doesn't have the same urgency as the original, it does its very best to prepare the way for something much grander.",8,2,21,21 November 2013
Godzilla," 'Godzilla' is, well, a 'Godzilla' movie
","About an hour into 'Godzilla,' my son summed Director Gareth Edward's reboot up with one simple statement. He tapped me on the shoulder and whispered in my ear, 'Dad, this movie is boring except for the fights.' He captured my exact thoughts about almost every film starring the King of the Monsters. I take a mental nap when humans are on screen and get jolted awake by the noise of two giant monsters fighting each other.Two giant creatures that feed on radioactivity head on a collision course towards each other, destroying everything in their path. Drawn to each other's mating calls, they follow their instincts to the greatest feeding ground on Earth: the nuclear waste dumps of Nevada. Godzilla must stop them before they destroy the world. However, will the he succeed in annihilating them without wiping out the human race in the process?Nobody watches a 'Godzilla' movie for the plots or human interaction. Except for the first film's warnings against nuclear devastation, the other entries in the franchise revolve around aliens or diabolical Earthly powers trying to take over the world using some sort of Kaiju. Audiences fumble their way through long stretches of narrative to get to see 20 minutes of Monday Night Smackdown between two giant creatures using Tokyo as a wrestling ring.If you walk into 'Godzilla' expecting to see a 'Godzilla' movie, then you'll be just fine. If you go into it anticipating what I did, you'll probably leave disenchanted. I don't know why, but I was expecting Director Gareth Edwards to up the amount of battle scenes and appearances by our title character. I wanted him to make the 'Godzilla' flick I wanted to see - less yammering and more hammering.The acting in 'Godzilla' isn't bad, but it isn't phenomenal either. Everyone takes the attitude that audiences aren't coming to the movie to see humans, so why put forth too much effort. That's what it felt like to me. After watching so many disaster films over the past few months, I wanted a human story with as much weight as it had wanton giant monster destruction. I think I set myself up for disappointment.I was quite impressed with most of the CGI in 'Godzilla.' The King of the Monsters looked like the menacing one we've wanted to see all along. There's no signs of a man in a suit to be found here. The MUTOS creatures were much cooler than I expected from seeing still shots of the film.I did find it amusing that most of the effects-heavy sequences took place at night as to mask any CGI limitations. It's obvious the filmmakers for both this and 'Pacific Rim' didn't have the type of faith in the quality of their work that Michael Bay does with his 'Transformers' movies. They keep the Kaiju masked by the dark while Bay rolls his robots out into the exposing rays of the sunlight.The movie is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of destruction, mayhem and creature violence. There's no gore to be found and very little blood. A few soldiers and bystanders have a little blood caked on them, but that's about it. I was also impressed at the lack of bad language and adult situations. 'Godzilla' is surprisingly family-friendly and as tame as the older entries in the franchise.'Godzilla' is, well, a 'Godzilla' movie. You have to decide for yourself if that's to be considered a good or bad thing. The only difference between this and the older films is a lack of more Japanese people and the absence of a Toho logo at the beginning of the title credits.",7,11,19,20 May 2014
Looper," 'Looper' is science fiction the way it was meant to be: intelligent, thought-provoking, and exciting
","It's rare these days to find a truly exciting and thought-provoking science fiction film. When one does come along, it should be cherished and talked about among genre fans so the joy of viewing it is spread throughout the community. 'Looper' is one of those prized treasures that deserve to be talked about and doted on.Time travel is invented and declared illegal in the near future. The mob uses it in a very inventive way. Disposing of a body after eliminating a target has become very difficult thanks to science and forensic advances. They use it to transport a target into the past where a hired assassin called a 'looper' kills them and then burns the bodies. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of these highly-paid gunmen who are living the high life. That is until he's contracted to kill his future self (Bruce Willis) and things get complicated.Writer / director Rian Johnson ('Breaking Bad,' 'The Brothers Bloom') has created an intelligent and complex story that keeps viewers glued to the screen. It's been a long time since I've seen a film that so wonderfully blends together science fiction, action, and such a high level of emotional depth.I couldn't stop thinking about the premise of the movie throughout its two hour running time. There's never been a better visual illustration of the tragic aphorism, 'Eat, drink, and be merry; for tomorrow we die.' 'Looper' also drums up some paranoia and makes you re-examine the statements 'Every action has a reaction' and 'Everything we do matters.''Looper' is everything a science fiction movie should be. It uses entertaining storytelling to deliver a message or social commentary in a non-threatening and exciting way. I would use '12 Monkeys' and 'Source Code' as comparisons to 'Looper' if someone wanted an idea of what to expect from the movie. Great performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, and Jeff Daniels only add to the quality of this soon-to-be classic film.http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",10,3,8,29 December 2012
Pocahontas," 'Pocahontas / Pocahontas II' explores more from the 1990s animated Disney Renaissance
","'Pocahontas' shows us how the young Native American Princess meets Englishman John Smith. The two engage in a romantic relationship which brings to mind Romeo and Juliet. Her Indian tribe and his group of settlers clash over the land with tragic consequences. This was the first Disney movie based on an actual historical figure. It does a great job of keeping true to the spirit of the actual incidences it's based on. That's not to say it doesn't stray away from fact or embellish a bit to keep things interesting and family friendly. There are messages of racial equality and environmental preservation throughout the film as well. What would a Disney movie from the 1990s be without social commentary? John Smith leaving Pocahontas behind at the end of this movie didn't give me a sense of 'Happily Ever After' I expect from these types of movies. This movie is different from most of the Princess animated features like 'Cinderella,' 'Snow White,' or 'Beauty and the Beast.' Instead of waiting for Prince Charming to come along, Pocahontas takes matters into her own hands. Many females will embrace the concept and identify with the message of the movie.",7,0,1,4 September 2012
Warm Bodies," 'Warm Bodies' is a flawed but entertaining mix of 'Night of the Living Dead,' humor, and romance
","Zombie movies are a dime a dozen right now. This charming little mix of action, horror, and a love story changes things up a bit. It provides a satisfying experience, yet left me surprised there wasn't more funny parts.'Warm Bodies' tells the tale of a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult). R spends his days wandering through an airport aimlessly. One day he saves a girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) from an attack by the walking dead. The two become unlikely friends, which appears to restore R's humanity over time. Have they discovered a way to bring the zombie masses back to life?As a whole, 'Warm Bodies' works. I have to say I was expecting more humor than I got. While it was funny, it fell short of delivering the grins trailers promised. Director / Writer Jonathan Levine did a great job with creating a bond between the two lead characters. However, Julie accepts the fact that R ate her boyfriend way too casually.The zombie carnage and gory imagery isn't downplayed anywhere near as much as one would expect in an adaptation of a young adult novel rated PG-13. There's plenty of scenes of the living dead eating dinner. Creatures called 'Bonies' also offer a higher level of horror than what one would expect from a zombie romance / comedy.Although 'Warm Bodies' doesn't deliver the laughs I was expecting, it's still an entertaining and warm film. It's a less campy and more serious mix of 1993's 'My Boyfriend's Back' and 'I Am Legend.' There's something for horror fans and romantics to enjoy in this movie.",8,0,0,5 June 2013
