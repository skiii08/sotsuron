The King's Speech," The King's Speech is a good movie
","The King's Speech is a good movie, but that's it, it does not exceed the limit of a video, it has its merits, but when you think about the possibilities and even the possibilities of the cinema, 'the Kings' does not exceed anything .It is all done on a very shallow scale, a video made to satisfy and respond to the orders of those who asked or even to follow the course of the 2000s, which generated a line of biblio- cinematographic achievements on the reigns, especially the English royalty. Even the performances follow the same rhythm, Colin Firth is fine, but we know of his ability, honestly here, it was not the time to receive his Oscar as best actor.Geoffrey Rush goes further, which is the great relief of the film, his good character, can follow a rhythm of his own, but nothing more than something great, and we know that Rush is an excellent actor.Perhaps this strangeness of being only good is justified by the direction of Tom Hooper, who is more accustomed to television accomplishments, which we can check in 'King ...', not only because it is a closed script in internal locations, with a lighting Very clear and at the same time very artificial, but mainly for punctuating plans and against plans, a simple work almost lazy that the TV uses to simplify to the maximum and make clear what is talked about and with whom one talks, not opening spaces for Reflections and possibilities.Apart from this the scenarios, especially where we have the presence of the character 'Lionel Logue', is a clear reference of old age and decomposition that conversely give beauty to the film, however, Hopper (specifically close to the characters seated), abuses in wanting to present Such scenarios with cutouts that even work, but that used too much, tiring and only show that they are there like figurative form of a little explored world.",7,0,0,17 June 2017
Casablanca," Casablanca is a utopian world, a great metaphor about life that is at once the limbo linking hell to paradise.
","In 'Adaptation' by Spike Jonze, 'Casablanca' is referred to as a masterpiece for those who want to study and create a screenplay, the consideration is made by screenwriter Robert McKee (Brian Cox), and without a doubt: it is.The 1942 classic directed by Michael Curtiz, goes through the centuries as the reference of the seventh art, mainly for the development of its history, an exquisite script that follows the classic linear structure (beginning, middle and end), and who knows how to take advantage of it To provoke small breaks in linearity, in developing a dramatic history whose past we do not know but which is a fundamental part that interferes with the decisions and characteristics of a character, and an uncertain future, but with clear possibilities. We know the paths available to the protagonists, but which will be the chosen and the reason, this only know at the end of the film. The script is based on the play 'Everybody Comes To Rick's,' being developed in three hands, by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koc. A curiosity is that the text of the piece only got to be mounted (years) later, and the rights to the cinema was one of the highest values ​​paid at the time.'Casablanca' begins with an ironic narration, close to the comedies that parody wars, and at different moments we have this jocular air in the dialogues of the personages, such as Richard Blane (Humphrey Bogart ) That satirizes its condition of abandoned man or of the transitory condition and of waiting of the great room of connections that is the 'airport Casablanca'. However, the script makes the slide precisely by wanting to present the external world through flash black, a feature that does not add anything interesting to the film, but is an easy way out to try to clarify important facts of the past, yet something that a script So bright and a precise direction, could have solved with other means.A thriving feature used to compose the illumination of the film is the idea of ​​a lantern of a lighthouse, which reflects its turn throughout that city, although spatially speaking, the light of this lighthouse reveals that Casablanca is as short as the extension between two open arms , But it is clear the proposal of director Michael Curtiz that with the direction of photography of Arthur Edeson, create an atmosphere of occultism, and that as the characters, we only have vestiges of shadows, they are not clear, as the lapses of illumination , Which little by little reveals something. Another point that contributes to the illumination and photography adopted is the total superficiality employed. We are in a city in Morocco, where sunlight is strong and abundant, but as 'Casablanca' was shot in the studio, and also proposes the features of a Superficial city, its illumination is composed of lamps, chandeliers, lamps, glares and lighthouses and rarely we have reflections of the sun. This artificiality is also felt in the direction of art performed by Carl Jules Weyl, who in what would be internal and external scenarios, works with very definite oppositions, in the internal environments we have the richness of details, as in the bar 'Ricks Café American' or ' Club Owner Signor Ferrari 'in these environments everything is very luxurious and grandiose and well explored in open plans or the close detail minutiae revealing a beautiful work of composition of images and Mise en scène.The soundtrack is marked by the classic 'Like the Time Goes By' and La Marseillaise, the national anthem of France. Both gain 'status' in addition to soundtrack, become 'leitmotiv', and generating some uneasiness, in the third strand of La Marseillaise more than to know that the French are there or that it is a quest to praise France, we know that It is an insecurity on the part of the director to clarify points that are already established as local skin frequented or by the uniforms used by the characters (eg differentiate German soldiers from the French). But the apex of exaltation of the national anthem of France occurs when it is used to provoke the Germans, capable even of uniting the French who are in the Rick café and under German rule.Humphrey Bogart as Richard Blane, Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund Laszlo and Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, stand out individually, and the alien origin of each actor favors the clandestine and migratory game inherent in the film. If separately each actor stands out, the combination in a love triangle works even more, and greatly divides the viewer to the lovable favoritism of Ilsa's character, for both the charming Blane and the heroic Victor are charismatic and with divergent qualities, but Together only complicate yet another position that helps in determining who Ilsa should stay with. None of these characters fall on a Manichean scale to the bad side. Some are cynical, some lie, some kill",9,1,1,17 June 2017
Alien," A root Sci-Fi.
","In a direct and simplistic summary, 'Alien' is a movie about things that can jump out of the dark and kill you. Share a kinship with movies like: shark, Halloween and others that involve varied spiders, snakes, tarantulas and persecutors. But the looks end many before that.One of the great strengths of 'Alien' and consequently of director Ridley Scott, is his pace. 'Alien' takes your time. He waits. It allows silences (the majestic opening shots are underlined by Jerry Goldsmith with only distant metallic vibrations). This suggests the enormity of the team's discovery, building itself up with small steps: the interception of a signal (is it a warning or an SOS?). The descent to the extraterrestrial surface. The bitching by Brett and Parker, who care only about collecting their shares. The master stroke of the dark surface through which the crew members move, their helmet lights hardly penetrate the soup. The shadowy outline of the alien ship. The sight of the alien pilot, frozen in his command chair. The enormity of the discovery inside the ship.'Alien' uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the film: it evolves the creature's nature and appearance, so we never know exactly what it looks like and what it can do. We assume that, in the first place, the eggs will produce a humanoid, because that is the shape of the petrified pilot on the alien ship long lost. But of course we do not even know if the pilot is of the same race as the load of leathery eggs. Maybe he also considers them as a weapon. The first time we take a good look at the alien, when it explodes in the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic, and critic Tim Dirks mentions his 'open and dripping vaginal mouth.'Certainly, the character of Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, would have attracted readers of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. She has little interest in the novel of finding the alien, and even less in her employer's orders that it be brought back home as a potential weapon. After she sees what she can do, her response to 'Special Request 24' ('Return to alien life form, all other priorities rescinded') is succinct: 'How can we kill it?' His relentless hatred for the alien is the common thread running through the three 'Alien' sequences, which have gradually declined in quality but retain their motivating obsession.Finally, there is the inheritance that 'Alien' made possible to the genre Sci-Fi and in addition and much more besides the franchise films that followed after the film of 1979, glimpses the craft relation of producing a film that could go by the yearnings of the Commercial cinema and also by the relation of not giving up the original embryo and not clichÃ© between suspensions, terror and fiction.",9,1,2,11 June 2017
Drive," Everything in 'Drive' is very interesting.
","Everything in 'Drive' is very interesting, from the disturbing gaps proposed by the script, its soundtrack full of synthesizers with descriptive messages of the characters, the neo-noir style (neon) adopted by photography and the impeccable frames that refer to the Tarantino style.'Drive' is a script adapted by Hossein Amini, inspired by the books of the series 'Diver' of the American writer James Sallis, having been directed in 2011 by the Danish Nicolas Winding Refn. A curiosity is that Ryan Gosling, protagonist of the film, indicated the director for the studios of FilmDistrict.In 'Driver' Ryan Gosling lives the unnamed protagonist, who is not mentioned or named at any time in the film, this already punctuates the mysterious characteristic of the character, who has nocturnal habits and sometimes makes vigilante figure of the streets of the city of Los Angels, who he knows very well, so well, that the film starts with Ryan making clear his skill as a connoisseur of the streets and of a driver, and that he comes down to that moment, the service for which he is being hired or to come After that service does not interest you. All this initial speech of the protagonist is captured in asymmetrical cuts of a window, with a play of shadow and light characteristic of the film noir and that collaborate for the construction of a prologue that presents a situation, does not explain anything, what the public can count It is with that moment and that situation that sets and presents in a small dose, one of the faces of the protagonist.It stands out in the prologue a concise presentation of the film proposal, being very clear that it intends to be and the form that will use for that. A magnificent work of script and direction that added to the photography, editing, art and soundtrack promote an exceptional and deservedly top 10 of the best films made in 2011, yielding to Winding Refn the award for best director at the Cannes Film Festival . Still on the prologue, among other highlights, the appeal of joining the escape of the assailants against the police, where in the car Ryan hears the narration of a basketball game, which will serve as narration of the escape and helper for thieves if Disperse, in the car where the two bandits escape being led by Ryan, we have a camera that records all the moments inside the car and reveals the driver through the rear view mirror and reflection on the front panel of the car. After the successful escape, we have a stylized sign with a pink neon color that entitles the film and having as background the suggestive 'Night Call' (Kavinsky & Lovefoxxx), notice that from the musical choice the insertion in the title, the clippings and the Neon photography, everything is very well thought out and structured, collaborating even more to prepare the terrain of 'Drive' that does not only mean driving, that is to say also impulse, motivation, the latter being the primary characteristic of Ryan Gosling's character, he is a A hero who rides around the city in search of motivation, something that drives his life and makes him a real hero.The dialogues in 'Drive' are constructed by an originality and punctuality very rare. So much that it is a film of few speeches and several moments of silence that say much, mainly by the game realized by the actors, where the interpretation of a subtext is much more important and evocative than any other speech. Among the performances Bryan Cranston - as Shannon - stands out. The versatility of this actor, famous for playing Walter White in the Breaking Bad series, once again shows his ability to create differentiated characters with a careful attention to the details and subtleties of a smile or the discomfort of a mancar. The rest of the cast promotes a precise job, but Ryan Gosling as a driver, leaves at various times an inaccuracy of proposals, are several plans showing the actor with a neutral physiognomy that does not express anything, nor do they evoke any dialogue or collaborate for a Narrative, its inexpressiveness turns into empty moments and that generate a certain annoyance before a break in the action that says nothing.'Drive' is a dark film with nocturnal shots and alternates with clear internal plugs with an abuse of orange and yellow tones, its prolonged silences taken by a transmission of suggestion of the actors / personages that alternate what is said with what if That is to say, a story that presents a plot initially with a romantic bias and turns into a brutal violence, with strong scenes and its takes and plans that reminisce much the Tarantino films, mainly by the use plongée and against plongée, the use of a symbology Suggestive, such as the figure of a scorpion allied to the character of Ryan and the conversation with the child Benicio, where a villain is seen from the perspective of a children's drawing, in which to be of evil is an inherent condition of being, in short, in the Dualities that 'Drive' is constructed we have a coherent film, that is worth very much for the omission of answers and that make of this film a real work.",9,0,1,3 July 2017
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," 'Monty Python' makes it clear that the highlight will always be the joke, the laughter.
","The philosopher Henri Bergson devoted much of his studies on comedy, as we can see in his book (TEST ON THE MEANING OF THE COMIC). In this work, which breaks down the foundation of laughter, Bergson points to an idea in which the English comedy group 'Monty Python' uses it almost as a thesis, in the case: Laughter is the mechanics applied to the living being.In 'Monty Python & the Holy Grail' (1975), we have all the distribution of a mechanics applied subtly, without toadyism's or presented in a mandatory way in order to provoke the amusement of the public, although it is a comedy, it is not performed Openly as conventionally other films of the genre are proposed, something that can be verified in the film 'The Meaning of Life', later work of that same group, that uses of 'sketches', something simplistic and shallow in the construction of conceited, mainly if we consider The complexity of the comic effect employed in a feature film with focal and linear history.The comedy whose main satire focus is on the legend of King Arthur, is a work written and performed by the group Monty Python and which was directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones. The satire employed expands its limits by showing a king on a sacred mission, and who, because he is a believer of his condition, provokes laughter by having this severity interrupted by riding on an imaginary animal which exists only through the beating of a coconut, A sound effect entrusted to his helper Patsy (Terry Gilliam), the sonority is enough for King Arthur of the Bretons (Graham Chapman) to believe to possess a horse that accompanies him through the English lands. This effect not only of the sound, but of a king almost in the mold of the Danish tale 'The new clothes of the king', where a noble parades naked, but believing to dress a beautiful clothes, therefore, his tailor told him, in King Arthur's crazy, imaginative stance added to the sound of the coconuts will be calculations resulting from a recurring mechanical summation in the film, something Bergson identifies as the mechanics of repetition for laughter.'Repeat, a combination of circumstances repeated exactly on several occasions, in stark contrast to the changing course of life - the more comic the repetition (or coincidence) the more complex the repeated scene is and the more natural it is represented (two Conditions - complexity and naturalness that seem to be excluded, and which the ability of the theatrical author should reconcile) '. Bergson, 1900.The highlight of this characteristic repetition in 'Monty Python & the Holy Grail' is the sophistication in which it is built, and in the moments when it is inserted, therefore, it is something that runs the risk of being tiring or beaten but that in the movie exercises A charm to the point of wanting more. The same effect occurs in all circumstances in which King Arthur and his companions attempt to invade castles, but never succeed. Since the attempts, these different, always fail, even when they prove to be an excellent idea, as in the attempt to mold the Trojan horse, which in the film is replaced by a large wooden rabbit handed over to the French.An interesting division made to know each of the Knights of the Round Table in detail is a break with the Brecht theatrical model, a break with the fictional narrative, presenting a historian (current to the period in which the work was performed), and Of a television program, explains or tries to explain what happened to the knights, but a tragicomic outcome is given to the teacher, this unused break for free, gains permanent prominence as we feed back the plot of the film, evoking moments of Laughs through the repetition of interruptions of medieval history by a modern police investigation.Direction and photography make primary recording slips, in some scenes, for example, there is lens blur, and the use of open planes can not always communicate the size of what one wants to reveal, perhaps this occurs for a budget limit , Since many of the plains scenes are flattened in medium planes that do not account for registering castles and settlements (something that needs investments for construction), already in the dark scenes or of mists, the use of close's, big close's and open plans , Rather than assisting in any dialogue, only complicates and diminishes the intended comic effect.It is worth mentioning that the moments of insertion of the animations are all very well inserted, besides the impeccable art that collaborates and helps in the construction of a comic proposal, and even being drawings inserted in a human history, are used naturally. As Bergson explains, this occurs when a certain comic effect derives from a certain cause, the more natural we are to judge, the greater the comic effect will seem to us: we already laugh at the deviation which appears to us as a simple fact. More risible will be the deviation that we see arise and increase before us, whose origin we know and whose history we can reconstitute. The cause of the insertion of these drawings into the film are always the results of a world and a divine order, which leave the terrestrial plane and present themselves as the world of the human extra-plane, and are recorded just like the illustrations of the catholic church in the middle ages , However, without the seriousness of the trait of the church, but always of the comic trait.",8,0,1,18 June 2017
