Source Code," I want back my time!
","I am a huge fan of science fiction and especially, of those movies about time travel and parallel worlds like Triangle, Chronocrimes, Predestination or Coherence. So I was very excited to see this movie and experiment a new plot about time travel and thrilling action. Even though, the plot sounds kind of novel, I found the execution very bad and even, boring. I felt the main character knew exactly what he had to do but instead of that, he was losing time with the girl next to him in the train. At the end, i didnt like the plot twist of the agent saving the girl and creating and alternate reality where the man was alive and he was his consciousness.",5,0,1,19 November 2018
Joker," A devastating and raw Masterpiece
","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. From the very beginning, you can feel the misery and violence that Joker is experiencing and how the society is totally f%#*ed. I love the way the movie portrays color, especially the same Joker make up. It seems so vivid in a depressing and wash out environment. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix is totally epic. The way he moves, he speaks, he laughs, he dances. It's like he has been the joker since ever. The level of violence in the film is genius. Sometimes you see the character as a poor person but sometimes he seems totally crazy and dangerous. The best part for me is the way the movie gives you some tips and clues for you to make your own conclusions about the story. And finally I feel very identified with Joker in the part he recriminates society and authorities about their hypocresis and the way they see poor and Middle class people as we are objects inside the system and they think they can tell us how we feel or how to be 'successful' with just some words and no action.",10,1,3,7 October 2019
