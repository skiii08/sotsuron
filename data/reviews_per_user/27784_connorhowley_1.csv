Gremlins," Scared me when I was little
","When I first saw this movie ( I was in elementary school back then), I was expecting a nice kids films with nice cute furry creatures, and well, I got the creatures, but not the way I expected. Now anyways, this movies starts with a inventor, Rand Peltzer(Hoyt Axton)going to Chinatown, looking for a gift for his son, Billy(Zach Galligan) for Christmas. He goes into a shop and after a failed attempt to pitch one of his inventions, the bathroom buddy, he hears something in the back. There's a box, with a extremely adorable creature named a Mogwai, singing an equally as cute song. Although the owner(Keye Luke) refuses to sell Peltzer the Mogwai, his grandson(John Louie), says different. Before he sells the Mogwai, the boy tells Peltzer 3 rules to follow: 1;don't expose him to bright lights(especially sunlight, it kills him), 2;don't get him wet, and the most important one, NEVER feed him after midnight. While Peltzer isn't the one in this movie who winds up breaking the rules, his son does. After getting his new pet, now called Gizmo(and struggling not to break rule #1), he winds up breaking rules #2 & #3, which as a result forces poor Gizmo to... we'll just say, the title creatures are born and wreak havoc on Billy's hometown, Kingston Falls. While I was frightened with this movie back then, now I just shake it off. The scene in the bar is quite funny(I'm not giving anything away.), and I find Gizmo to be soooooooo cuuuuuute, I prefer the sequel overall. C.",7,0,2,1 October 2006
