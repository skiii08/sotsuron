","See the thing I hate most about people who review movies is that all the good movies that have a plot and an actual story get the bad ratings and reviews, and then there's this movie. Let me start off by saying I'm currently watching this movie while writing this because I have already lost complete interest in this. Why did I lose interest in this?? Because the plot and screenplay is complete garbage, everything about the timeline of this movie is horrible put together and makes no sense unless you google it. What I don't understand is how
This movie has great ratings because honestly this movie is just plain bad. I've never written a review before and I was hoping this movie would resolve itself but it still hasn't and i doubt it will. I decided to give this movie a chance because I grew up watching and loving every single one of Hayao miyazakis movies and I thought why not I'll give this a shot. But here I am regretting this movie. The only thing I like about this movie is the animation which is beautiful. It looks like they spent 95% of their efforts on the animation and just gave up with the plot, but to each their own I guess. I was hoping this would've been better.",3,2,15,8 July 2018

","Currently writing this while I've been on the same ceiling dancing scene for 12 minutes now. Only reason I'm watching this is because Thomas Bangalter did the music. This is not a movie and I will never understand how critics rate this a 'good' movie, smh.",1,5,10,16 July 2019
