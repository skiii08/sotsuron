The Avengers," Overrated, Cliché Marvel Film
","Never saw it in the movie theater, but I had heard that it was great, and awesome. After some time it finally hit DVD, so I rented it, and I was completely disappointed. There was nothing amazing about it. The acting was okay, the story was meh, and the villain (which in my opinion is a big part of a super hero film) was just awful. People don't know about movies now a days, the fact that the quote 'Best Super hero move of all time' is printed on the DVD cover, really makes me doubt the film industry today. If this mess of a movie can make over a billion dollars at the box office, and Masterpieces can't even get 100 millions is disheartening. Hands down the most over rated movie of all time. It's bland, its cliché and I don't understand how people can eat this crap up.",6,3,7,24 August 2014
Skyfall," Experience of the Year...
","James bond is a theme rather that a movie franchise, and in the newest one we see a mesh of the classic bond we knew, and a well-rounded, solid modern day film. In Skyfall, I was surprised to experience suspense and thrilling scenes. Daniel Craig, was in the last two Bond films, they were okay, Quantum of Solace was a big disappointment, but with Skyfall, redemption is met. The acting and acting scenes are both spectacular, and even the opening credits are a sight to see. It truly is one of the best Experiences of the Year. This one is a total 'Watch' 9.5/10'With pleasure, Always with Pleasure'<ul><li>James Bond</li></ul>",9,2,11,13 November 2012
The Prestige," '...You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled.'
","Another classic by Christopher Nolan. Not only is this movie masterfully written, but the cast is great, and the performances are great. The movie is extremely clever and well directed. The Prestige will keep you guessing until the very end. The movie does run a bit long though, but, the movie is great that you can forgive it for its long run time.The movie tells the story of two magicians and how they slowly become rivals. A war ensues between these two magicians, and the movie transitions to being centered around a specific magic trick. This movie is great, and is close to being a Masterpiece.",10,0,1,27 August 2014
Django Unchained," Bloody, Suspenseful and a Great Western
","Django Unchained on the surface, looked decent, and nothing to intriguing about it. But after my friend nagged me to watch it, I finally gave it a shot, and I was utterly surprised. The movie was very good. The usual witty dialoge Quentin Tarantino Usually provides, as well as the bloody action scenes. The movie is very entertaining and keeps you intrigued, because of its great acting from the whole crew. But the movie really shines when the movie gets to its final act (about 30 minutes left) The movie takes a turn and presents one of the most suspenseful and climactic scenes in quite some time. If you like westerns and want to see something 'Different' definitely check out this movie",9,0,4,25 August 2014
The Dark Knight," A Masterpiece (In my Top 5 movies of all time)
","First off, anyone who says that this movie is Overrated, really needs to either take a second look at this movie, or reevaluate their taste in movies, because this movie is spectacular. I don't read batman comics, and I'm not vouching just because this is a super hero series. What Chris Nolan did was far beyond any other director of the franchise, and in general movies. One of the best villains of all time is in this movie, Heath Ledger as The Joker, he encompasses true evil, and really unleashes chaos into Gotham, which makes this movie unlike the typical super hero movie, TDK looks at the darkness a super heroes life and the aftermath a villain like the joker causes. The acting is incredible, the special effects and action scenes are spot on, and every scene with the joker is tense and nerve wrenching. This is the only movie I have ever seen Twice at the movie theater. A true masterpiece of cinema. 10/10",10,1,4,2 September 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," An over the top 'Comedy'
","Leonardo DiCaprio acts great in this movie, Jonah Hill, acts his usual self, trying to be funny, but ultimately failing. The cinematography is good, but a movie like this one was too quirky for its own good. Way over the top with every theme in the film. Another issue I had with this film was the glamorization of, really, just a bad human being (Jordan Belfort). The consequences don't seem to effect the protagonist much, and really I can't root for a man that doesn't seem to be effected, and only cares about money. Scorsese also decided to add comedy an autobiographical crime movie. Which works sometimes, but really this story shouldn't be one of comedy, we shouldn't laugh at the things that happen to the characters, and think its all just a big joke. In particular there is a scene where Jonah Hill and Leo's character decide to take Quaaludes. A form of drug. What insues is, again, and over the top scene where Jonah Hill is choking, and pretty much jeopardizing the well being of Jordan Belfort. I didn't even smirk, cause I didn't know this scene was supposed to be funny. What in the world? This scene was supposed to be comedic? I don't know what Scorsese was thinking when he made this movie, but it fall short. The movie did however have some quirky moments, and I will say it is entertaining to watch, and the acting is great from most of the cast, but this obsession with over the top moments, and unnecessary comedy parts makes this movie just decent. -6/10",7,1,2,2 September 2014
Godzilla," Awful
","This movie is completely disappointing, which really didn't have anything going for it from the get go. We live in a digital age, where CGI like this, doesn't cut it. The trailer poses an 'intense' atmosphere, and really makes you wanna see what the movie is about, Unfortunately I wish hadn't. It was an unwise decision to kill off the best actor in the movie, Bryan Cranston. He acts good as he usually does, before he killed off for no reason, and replaced with a young, mediocre actor, for the rest of the movie. You'll be seeing a lot of soldiers, explosions, people running, and a monster that makes the original Japanese look like a masterpiece, and if you thought Godzilla had bad graphics, you haven't seen the bird that for some reason is in this movie. Just an awful movie",4,1,4,30 August 2014
