Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Well Worth The Wait!!!
","This movie was very well directed and coordinated. It was an edge of your excitement film with all the lavish, sympathy, and action that you would expect!! I definitely recommend watching it....Twice Even!!!! I am writing this comment right after watching the 12:01 showing and I can tell you now, that the wait was well worth it...This movie is not one to miss!!!! One more thing by the way, I also felt that the designing of the costumes used in the film was very well organized and hope that Episode II and III bring out the best of all the characters as the did in Episode I!!",3,0,1,19 May 1999
