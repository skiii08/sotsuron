It," IT is one of the best horror movies i've watched.
","I'll just start off by saying, if you are hyping up for this movie and you just can't wait to see it... YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!PROS : The Loser's Club is the best and i love all of them, The casting and the acting of each character is really on point and the bullies are really evil and brutal which is true to the novel. The story is great and there's no boring part at all, every scene felt like it has a purpose. The cinematography and directing is great too. Last but not least... BILL SKARSGARD AS PENNYWISE IS TERRIFYING! If you thought Pennywise in the trailers were creepy, oh man... You haven't seen anything yet. If i have to describe Bill's performance as Pennywise it would be terrifying and unexpected.CONS : The only thing that makes me kinda sad is I wish there is more screen time for Pennywise. I'm not saying that Pennywise rarely show up but a few more minutes of him would have made this movie perfect.IT is one of the best, if not the best horror movie i've seen in my life. It doesn't even rely on scary scenes or jumpscares to make this film good, this movie had everything in it, it's got comedy, drama, romance and this movie really make you care about the characters, which i found really rare to happen in today's horror movies.",9,8,20,7 September 2017
