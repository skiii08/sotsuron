The Blair Witch Project," buy dramamine!
","The worst thing about the film was the camera work.  I think the film makers mistook queasiness for fear.  I wish they had leaked to the movie audience more about the 'legend', and given us a little less to imagine ourselves as the creeping horror.  A well placed humanlike figure in the scenes where the characters were running to/from something would have gone a long way to make me actually scared.  All in all, I would rather have had someone on screen reading Victorian ghost stories over shaky-cam.",5,0,2,23 July 1999
