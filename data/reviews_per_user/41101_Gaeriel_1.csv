Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Perfect Beginning to the Perfect Saga
","I seen this movie twice, and the good points outweigh the bad by a trillion. If it wasn't for all the hype, it would be better appreciated. There are two more movies, George Lucas is not going to explain every mystery in the first one! To explain some things, here's what I have:(they say) jar jar sucks (i say) tough, he's going to be in the next two episodes, if you can't handle it, get out.(they say) the story is low on emotional resonance (i say) IT'S EPISODE 1!!!!!!! This movie is only the first of three!!! Anyways, have you seen 'A New Hope'? I mean, look at Luke, number 1: he sees the remains of his foster guardians, and is utterly depressed. 10 seconds later, he's complaining about the cheap price that he sold his landspeeder for. Number 2: He's really depressed over the death of his mentor, Ben Kenobi, 15 seconds later, he screaming, cheering and whooping over shooting down TIE fighters. You see something here?(they say) The actors who play Jedi Knights suck (i say), look, these aren't ordinary people. They've got special powers and everything. Of course they're 'enigmatic', they're Jedi Knights!(they say) Ewan McGregor has too many lines (i say) it's an introduction for a younger Kenobi. He's an apprentice, remember? Anyways, if you want more lines, than wait til episode 2, then he's a full Jedi, and no doubt will have better lines.(they say) there's some racist stuff (i say) well, what do you want!?! If they change it, some person would probably find something else 'distasteful' about it!So, I hope I made myself clear. If you are still comparing it to some movie like Titanic on emotional scale (get over it, the boat SANK!), Star Trek lurks around the corner.........Anyways, this movie is one that you don't want to miss. It's better treated as a normal movie(although it's nothing like that), dont't compare it to the Trilogy. I look forward to the next two movies.......",Null,0,0,9 October 1999
