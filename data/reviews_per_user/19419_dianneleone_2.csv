The Hangover," This movie just shows how far our society has sunk :p
","I thought this movie was total trash! Not funny at all. Just a bunch of stupid frat boy humor. I was actually depressed watching it, because it just goes to show you how low our society has sunk. Seems that Hollywood has no limits anymore on how to make money off of sex, drugs, exploiting women, and lack of caring for animals and children. This is just mindless garbage. The lead character (Bradley Cooper) is also extremely annoying. He plays a Dick in every show he is in, and I have a hard time believing it is far from reality. It is actually insulting to the general public that the majority of people that went to see this movie gave it such high ratings. stupid and sad!",1,13,26,27 March 2010
Man of Steel," Terrible...I walked out.
","Let me sum it up...Great visuals, beautiful scenes and sets, great action but absolutely no good story telling at all. No chemistry at all between Lois and Clark, and choppy rushed flashbacks explaining his past. Amy Adams playing Lois Lane was mediocre at best. Henry Cavil could have been a great superman, if they had given him something better to work with. Boring after the first half of the movie. I can't believe people would compare The Dark knight to this jumbled mess. The Dark Knight was one of the best super hero movies and this one was one of the worst. I was such a fan of the original superman movies and this one was such a disappointment.",1,2,5,17 June 2013
