Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Entertaining yet poorly done.....
","Sadly as entertaining as this film was unfortunately all the hype was far to much to live up to. the original trilogy being so strong. Thought there have been several advances in special effects technology in recent years one can't help but feel that a lot of soul is lost through the excessive use of special effects. The acting is extremely dire and without the effects this would just end up being a forgotten B grade sci-fi film. Even though we see the most memorable feature of star wars in this film 'the light sabre' the duels are lacklustre and the joy of the double edged light sabre is lost. Beautifully crafted the sith lord could be classed as the highlight of the movie but gets no where near the dizzy heights of the emperor in the original trilogy. Jar jar binks? what where they thinking??? you might as well have had the sickly cute Ewoks from RTOJ, at least they were more realistic than a computer animated kangaroo lizard with a Rather annoying voice, far too childish and uninspiring. The pod race is definitely the highlight of this move though. The only exciting pulse quickening scene in the film.... All in all not a bad movie not great either.",5,1,2,14 April 2005
Quantum of Solace," Another Brilliant Daniel Craig Bond.........
","Fast Cars! Non stop action and plenty of globe trotting with Daniel Craig as bond! what could be better? I hadn't read any reviews or heard the theme song etc. before the movie so I went in with an open and unbiased mind and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Though some bond fans may differ! The story is very fast paced for a bond and gadgets are not really existent apart from the Sony phones, computers etc. I've never seen bond with so many cuts and bruises!!!(very realistic!). This movie does loose out on getting a perfect 10 due to the lack of certain bond trademarks. 1- The famous gun barrel intro was pushed to the end of the movie. 2- No formal introduction 'My name is Bond, James Bond' But then again. this film is more about the making of James Bond(his turning into the Jame Bond we know and love so much, The Man of Wine, Women and Wonder. A good film, but we still want to see the classic Bond trademarks.",8,3,7,13 November 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Interesting fictional chiller...
","This taught thriller Verges on a Horror Movie at times... and chills. The evil Adi Amin is brilliantly portrayed by the magnificent Forest Whittaker. You get a true sense of being in Uganda in the 1970's. the scenery reminded me of my childhood in Kenya, though Jame's Mcevoys doctor character was a little too hippie for my liking at times, and his stupidity at times baffling. This is definitely Forrest's film and he steals the show, though we could have gone a little further and explored Idi's evil side as there was definitely more than was displayed in the movie. The story nevertheless is quite interesting and really picks up pace towards the end leaving you at the edge of you seat at times. Most of the major events during Amin's reign are shown and historically apart from the fictional doctor character the film is fairly correct. A definitely good film to watch.",7,1,2,16 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The soul of star wars returns!!!
","after the hugely disappointing episode 1 and the slightly better episode 2 here comes a film with soul that the original films had. This epic though not great is far better than the last 2 films. If you thought Star Wars was meant to be fun all round family entertainment, think again... this film follows in the vein of Graphic Manga comics and seizes to be a larger than life space movie, Instead we get bogged down with the complexities of the good & the dark side. What leads one to the dark side, there is certainly a macabre undertone to this movie hence the 12a(Uk)rating which in some cases makes you think if it isn't a tad bit low for this film. ****Possible Spoiler**** Anakin's near death scene with the molten lava is quite chilling if not highly unnerving but at least it answers the question to how Anakin ends up as the crusty powder complexioned man at the end of ROTJ... Yoda is simply stunning in this film... the facial expressions created and movements are very real. we actually get to see real emotion in an animated character. though the film does have its pitfalls.. the technology in the film far surpassed the technology in the original trilogy which makes you think what happens to all that technology? even though sets similar to the originals are slowly blended in with the effects in this movie as a transition to the original 'Star Wars A New Hope' The dialogue is not the best in places. and thats where it goes into bad quality kid movie territory. Mace Windu's death is one of the highlights of this film as we get to see how the emperor came into being... Sadly C3-PO does not have much of a role in this movie and is just there to let you know this is a Star Wars film. Well R2-D2 does have some role in this film. all in all not a bad film not great either. (if you like special effects you will like this one!)",6,1,4,22 May 2005
The Queen," Poor disappointment.
","After hearing the rave reviews and hype surrounding this movie, I hired it from my local video store only to be hugely disappointed. This was a film that was meant to by about Queen Elizbeth, but ends out being a film all about the death of Princess Diana. The film is full of news clips and TV footage surrounding Diana's fatal crash, and the Queens reaction. Helen Mirrens rendition of the Queen is not bad, but definitely not worthy of the Oscar she received. The rest of the cast were simply dire. Made for TV drama's on the BBC and ITV have better acting than this. Prince Charles is made to look like a weak geeky mummy's boy with no credibility while Prince Philip fares no better, As for Tony Blair's character a TV comedian could have done a better job blind eyed. There's more to the real Queen than the death of Princess Diana. Its a shame we didn't get to see it. This film could have been more aptly named 'Diana A Royal Tragedy' not worth your money and the Oscar",3,4,11,16 May 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Heartwarming and hugely uplifting
","We in our lives always think we have it bad, credit card bills and lack of money, but then seeing this movie made me think really hard at my situation in life and in general my friends and family. It just makes you think that there's people in a lot worse than what you are. Being grateful for what you have is just the beginning. Beleiving in yourself, and going out there and not accepting defeat in the pursuit of happiness is the real story. Will Smith acted brilliantly as the single father trying to keep what he had left of himself and his son together. You get a real sense of the pain and the determination, and you somehow really want him to succeed in some ways even more than him. This is definitely one film that left a huge impact on my mind. A thoroughly enjoyable movie. A must see for everyone who's down in the dumps.",8,1,1,16 May 2007
