Blade Runner 2049," So . . . slow . . .
","Here's the biggest problem with BR2049. Everything . . . happens . . . so . . . slowly . . . And I do mean everything. In one scene, K goes to look for something hidden. The audience knows it's going to be there (it's so blindingly obvious) but *man* does it take him an age to get there. It's not even slo-mo. Practically every scene involves a character taking forever to walk somewhere or even get a sentence out. It echoes the interminably long silences of Gosling's Drive, except that Drive was actually interesting. Villeneuve even holds static shots for *way* longer than necessary.Okay Denis, we get it; this movie is pensive and cerebral. That's fine, but it doesn't need to be boring. And boring it is. Yes, it deals with issues of identity, purpose and love, but its 2hrs 45mins running time could have *easily* been trimmed to just 2 hours.BR2049 is both pretentious and dull; that's a deadly combo.",2,3,10,31 August 2019
Wonder Woman," An action movie with no action
","Wonder Woman is not a wonder; it's insanely boring, with scene after scene of either talking, walking, or talking while walking. The opening act on Diana's island goes on for far too long, with endless repetition of:
'I want to fight!'
'You can't! It's too dangerous! You don't know the truth!'
Come the climax, there are few (if any) surprises left.The action sequences are few and far between, damp squibs that attempt to compensate with excessive use of slo-mo (revealing Zack Snyder's firm hand in the production).The movie riffs too heavily on Marvel's better efforts - god-like fish out of water (Thor)? Check. Hidden island of peace (Black Panther)? Check. Shield-wielding war setting (Captain America)? Check.It's a female empowerment movie that still feels the need to give the protagonist a white, all-American love interest. Bizarre.Overall, Wonder Woman is at least 20 minutes too long (like all superhero movies these days), deathly dull for the most part and confused in its message. Not one I'd watch again.",4,2,10,30 March 2019
