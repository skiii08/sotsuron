Blade Runner 2049," Average
","There's a few cool scenes (like the sex one) but overall the movie isn't that great. The actions scenes feel unnecessary and are not very good, the plot is a bit wonky, the bad guys are Hollywood clich√©s, etc. The visuals are good but nothing extraordinary either. Overall this fits well with Denis Villeneuve's downward trajectory towards cookie-cutter Hollywood block busters.",6,3,5,18 March 2018
