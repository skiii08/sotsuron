Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Long with little suspense.
","What i missed in this motion picture is story and of course the Pearle. They should have kept with the pirates and the old characters. I'm a nostalgic and love to see the good old guys show up, it gives me a more secure feeling about the movie. Jack was more of a fetish for the lady's and Penelope tried to hard to be one for the male audience. The only guy i felt safe with was Barbossa and he developed a good curve in his story and was by far the most interesting one. What johnny was doing in the first two Pirates of The Caribbean was to make Jack like a drunk pirate who was always in the wrong place to the right time, now he was just a guy walking around doing obvious thing and predictable.The 3D effects was mildly good, unfortunately i was put one third to the side of the theater so i did not feel the 3D as good as i would from the center. But it did not live up to my favorite 3D movies like 'How to Train Your Dragon' or 'TRON:LEGACY'.Short summary:I was not satisfied by this movie, far from it. The most disappointing was Jack Sparrow, i put eight hours in a marathon this weekend to charge mi pirate mood. I missed the many fun and good characters but left with a good hope for the next part of this epic franchise.",6,2,4,18 May 2011
The Matrix Revolutions," Not as strikingly good as the others, but highly underrated.
","This movie is ask allot of questions and leave you figuring out the answers. What The Matrix trillogy is, is a question many humans should ask them self's. 'Why are we better than animals, are we really as importand as we think we are?'.Good:It has a dark theme with some intense scene's where you don't know if the good or the bad guys win. The same poetic philosophy that the others has but with more true meaning than the others. Left and ending that is open for sequels.Bad: Lost it's direction. Got to focused on the CGI",7,2,3,2 February 2011
