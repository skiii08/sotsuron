Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock at the movies
","Doesn't matter how you look at it, this movie is darn good fun. I loved it from opening credits to the close. So what if the acting is a bit over the top, so what if there are probably too many explosions and bullets and bombs. The end result is a thoroughly entertaining 2 hours at the movies with popcorn and Pearl and Dean ads. Moriarty is sufficiently creepy and played with restraint, Holmes is completely over the top but for me if its Robert Downey Jr there are no complaints. The story keeps moving and the action is terrific. The story is loosely based on the last book of the Conan Doyle's first series of Holmes stories ending with the famous Reisenbach Falls in Switzerland. It also gives a great image of early 20th century on the brink of the first world war. If you want to enjoy a good story with great imagery and costume then you will enjoy this, if you are looking for Sherlock ( wonderfully called Shirley by Mycroft ) as Conan Doyle intended then you may be disappointed.",8,22,28,29 January 2012
Midnight in Paris," Owen Wilson and a happy place
","It's so nice to see Owen Wilson back in his comfort zone. This is a good Woody Allen movie and Woody seems to have found a new muse in Owen. His speeches are much as you would expect Woody to speak if he were to take the role himself. Owen plays a fianc√© experiencing Paris while his future family seem to just want to get out of there. Owen's character seems more interested in writing a book and becoming a Bohemian. It is these ideals that are explored and explored well......but with a twist that is quite new. The movie also showed that it is still possible to be good adult entertainment without smut, sex, profanity or violence. Recommended ****",8,0,1,3 December 2011
Hugo," 1920's Paris comes to life
","This is a wonderful story about a boy, Hugo, who fixes and maintains the clocks in a Paris railway station after his father dies and leaves him an orphan. With the help of a young girl, Isabelle, they set about finding out the story of an old toymaker, Georges Melies, the young girl's father. In actual fact there are many story lines in this movie, many threads that are followed, and the way Scorsese ties them all together is wonderful. If I had any criticism it is that the actual story takes a while to get moving. In fact until about half way I wasn't sure where the story was going, which story was the main thread. If this was Scorsese's intention then the second half made it all worthwhile and I will certainly enjoy the whole movie on a second viewing. But I was a little bewildered for the first hour. I again commend the director for producing a wonderful movie without bad language, sex or gratuitous violence.",8,4,6,12 December 2011
