The Blair Witch Project," One of the Darkest Pictures I've ever seen.
","I give these people who made this low budget flick, credit for a truly disturbing flick.  I just saw it, having been under the influence from all them folks who love to bash it; why?  And after the short-lived 'hype' the 'in' thing seems to be bashing it.  Yes; it was like a home video.  Yes, there were unexplained things!  Gee; isn't that what 'Horror flicks' consist of?Since most people have at least some kind of mild spiritual belief this movie explores the worst possible Ghost scenario and puts the viewer in a position where there's no way out.  People do manage to get lost in the woods, despite modern development. That along with a very real history of Witch-scares and Homicidal maniacs, along with three kids being themselves (good acting), makes for a very suspenseful movie where the viewer wonders how deep the horror will get before death finally occurs and even then it's not over.Given without the modern day cinema effects that we're all accustomed to, it's also easy to block out, not pay attention, fall asleep, heckle, etc. With all due respect this movie was just as frightening as any of our great modern Blockbuster horror flicks just because the viewer was on the inside if he/she chose to be.Also I see it as an Inspiration for any young people in any area of the film industry; not a Scam.If your fortunate enough to have not seen this movie yet, see it.",Null,0,0,8 December 1999
