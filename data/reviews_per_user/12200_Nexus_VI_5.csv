50 First Dates," This movie is horrible. Avoid at all costs.
","Almost everything about this movie fails. The jokes are unfunny, Rob Schneider playing an islander (couldn't they get an actual Hawaiian actor?) is painfully offensive and, also, not funny; Adam Sandler's androgynous co-worker is so unfunny and forced it inflicts physical pain upon the viewer; and the basic premise is the icing on this turd cake: It's completely preposterous. It's an insult to the audience's intelligence that we're expected to believe that, every day, Drew Barrymore's character's father and brother repaint a room, and have thousands of copies of the same day's newspaper cleverly squirreled away in their house. Horrible, horrible, horrible movie. I beg you not to see it.",1,14,43,7 April 2007
The Number 23," Famously Bad
","This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Why? The writing and plot is juvenile and simplistic--big revelations that no-doubt had the screenwriter clapping in self- congratulation will have you rolling your eyes; characters are unbelievable and do unrealistic things; certain 'noir' conventions used are so trite they're laughable to watch. It really comes across as being written by a junior in high school, containing all the plot twists and characterizations that a 17-year-old would think were 'cool.' Unless you want to watch a truly bad movie and make snarky Mystery Science Theater-type comments during it with your friends--which this movie is a great candidate for--avoid it and see something better (which is just about anything), or do something constructive like mowing the lawn.",1,10,21,1 October 2007
The Departed," Good Movie That Could Have Been Great
","Most of The Departed is engaging and taut, with undercover characters always teetering on the edge of having their true identities discovered by either the cops or the crooks, and those parts of the film make for good cinema. However (spoiler alert) when Frank Costello (Nicholson) is prematurely killed in a run-of-the-mill drug raid that looks like it came from a lackluster TV series, the film loses something extremely important, and becomes a lesser movie because of it. Costello's character was the evil engine that drove the film's mood of menace and foreboding. As long as he lived, our hero DiCaprio was in constant peril, and Costello's influence infused everything, from DiCaprio's dissembling to Damon's character's double- agent work in the police department, with significance. There could have been a great climax involving the two rats and the Big Cheese their world revolved around. Instead, the movie falls apart and just meanders to an ending involving a supporting character delivering the coup de grace that should have been DiCaprio's. It was almost as if the filmmakers realized how long the film was running and decided to wrap everything up with whatever characters they had left. All in all, it's better than most mainstream films you might happen to see, but it's not worthy of an Oscar.",6,1,2,12 March 2007
Rear Window," Doesn't Stand the Test of Time Well
","Though I've enjoyed a couple other Hitchcock movies, this one is incredibly boring for 95+ percent of the viewing time. There are whole chunks of time wasted as the main characters debate about marriage and relationships that I thought we're going to somehow pay off but never do. What some people think is genius--the confinement of the action to Jimmy Stewart's apartment--is actually a severe handicap, as no energy is generated by interesting new locations or discoveries of place. The stagnant setting just intensifies the story's infectious feeling of malaise. There also should have been more of a mystery to it, to keep you guessing and interested. Instead, you pretty much know Thorvald is guilty right from the beginning, so there's not twist or surprise to help make things exciting. Again--extremely boring, the kiss of death for a 'thriller.' Skip this and watch North by Northwest instead.",2,26,53,5 September 2006
V for Vendetta," V is Preachy and Boring--Please Avoid
","I did not like V for Vendetta. Though I'm writing this review quickly, and not really crafting every sentence, I'll try to be comprehensive:First off, let's declare a moratorium on genetically engineered super soldiers who get special abilities or powers as the result of sinister manipulation by a shadowy government. It's been done again and again and again: Captain America, Wolverine, Blade Runner, the Universal Soldier, the Hulk (by some tellings of his story)and scores of othersand now V. It's so hackneyed that it's grating to watch another movie that uses it as the basis for a character's development. Or, if you must do it, at least give the recipient interesting powers or abilities, not the usual 'enhanced reflexes and strength.' V, unfortunately, doesn't get anything interesting, just the 'genetically engineered starter package.'V also steals the idea, and some of the visuals, of a dystopian England straight out of Orwell's 1984, but doesn't do it as well. Again, if you're going to copy another work, at least add something to the idea, or don't bother. Movin on, what does this dystopian society do to it's people? We're showed heavy handed second-hand tales of people being punished for being gay or even owning the Koran, told entirely without subtlety. We're practically bashed over the head with the fact that this is supposed to be the Bush Administration if it were 'turned up to 11.' And the maudlin scene at the end where the poor victims of the regime remove their V masks and watch Parliament burn was like a dopey Benneton ad. You feel like yelling 'Uncle! Uncle! I get it, just please stop sermonizing for the love of Neo!' At least it's over by that point. There are also points where the characters just do dumb things for the sake of the plot, which, in my opinion, undermines the credibility of the film. Some movies have a few small problems, but major points of the movie turn on these dumb oversights. Here are two major ones:  V faces down a cadre of soldiers at the climax, daring them to shoot him until they run out of ammunition. Of course, they shoot him in the body but the bullets have no effect, and none of them is smart enough, though presumably well-trained, to even try to shoot him in his flamboyant masked face, not one time. No, they think, let's just keep shooting him in his obviously armored body; Hey, maybe we'll get lucky! (they don't)  According to the film's contrived setup, the powers-that-be in the government had an entire year to prepare for V's bombing run at Parliament--But in their preparation they just happened to miss an entire railway station and a train tunnel that runs beneath the building!? This is completely idiotic! The inspector, always hot on V's heels, finds it within two minutes of looking for it at the movie's conclusion! But no one found it in the 12 months they had to fortify the area? Egregious writing, and the writers, obviously not thinking much of the viewing audience's intelligence, didn't bother to fix it. As I write this, I can't think of another movie that relies on such a stupid contrivance for its climax. Finally, though the marketeers made every effort to connect this movie to the Matrix and the Wachowski brothers to make it seem like it would be exciting, it's anything but. It moves at a glacial pace and is actually boring--the cardinal sin for a movie that supposedly falls in the 'action/adventure' genre (this according to Rotten Tomatoes categorization, at least). For a more rewarding experience, just read, or re-read, Orwell's 1984, or re-watch A Clockwork Orange. These provide much more visceral, chilling looks at dark, totalitarian futures. V for Vendetta movie is not worth your valuable time or money.",2,3,8,7 June 2007
