The Blair Witch Project," Waste of time and money
","There was nothing remotely scary about this movie.  If you have ever been in the woods you have seen something or thought of something much more intense than Blair Witch Project.  I will admit that after all the hype I was expecting much more.  However, I did not receive 10% of what was expected. After watching this movie you will not be sure what you were supposed to be afraid of.  I don't want to give away any information about this movie, other than please do not pay good money to see it.  If you must see it...maybe the bargain theater for $1.00 would be okay.  Please do not pay full price...even out on video (which I hear will be quite soon) please wait until it's a general title. (new release prices are too high) My husband wanted to see Lake Placid....if I can only go as low as 1 star for BWP I'd have to give Lake Placid 5",1,1,3,5 September 1999
