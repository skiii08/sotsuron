Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Why is there so much hate?
","I don't understand why so many people hate this movie because in my opinion it's very good. It's well made, well preformed (especially Jack Sparrow if you compare his performance in his latest movie) and it has an interesting story and just because there aren't so many connections with the previous movies it doesn't mean it has to suck. It's one of the best in the franchise and i absolutely love it and am glad they made this movie. I suggest this movie to everybody and don't listen to the haters just make your own opinion about it.",10,0,0,30 May 2017
