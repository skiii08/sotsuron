The Blair Witch Project," Beyond awful, possibly the very worst movie I have ever seen, ZERO STARS!!!!!
","A monumental disappointment. Total trash. NOT SCARY, NOT CLEVER, NOT ENTERTAINING. THIS IS NOT MY OPINION, THIS IS A FACT. I cannot believe that this movie received ANY positive reviews. The story, writing, acting, and editing, were all just plain bad. I do not even think this qualifies as a movie, It was more like a 5th graders school film project. If I could have given zero or less stars, I would have. Consider this review a public service, do not waste your time watching this garbage.",1,2,3,5 November 2017
