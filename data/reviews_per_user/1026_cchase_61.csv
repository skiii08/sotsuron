National Treasure: Book of Secrets," No 'Strain On The Brain'...
","Okay, first things first: Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and the right to vigorously express that opinion, especially when it comes to movies, and definitely here at this site. Having said that, no one can tell me with a straight face that they had no idea what they were getting themselves into, when they went to a theater to see or rented NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS. I mean, c'mon. Like its predecessor, it's a WALT Disney FILM, co- produced by JERRY BRUCKHEIMER. If you were expecting THE GODFATHER or LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, you should've gone to the video store and rented one or both of them.Just like the first TREASURE, it's another preposterous knockoff of the INDIANA JONES films set in post-modern times, without the grit and gravitas of Harrison Ford. (No offense to Nic Cage, but it's HARRISON FORD!) And like a 2-D version of a Disney theme park ride, this is not meant to stimulate the deep-thinking portions of your frontal lobe, parietal lobe or cerebral cortex whatsoever. Pleasure centers ONLY, people. The bombastic, ridiculous plot points wash over you, including all the leaps in logic and plot holes the size of Jupiter. You won't remember most of what happened two hours after seeing this anyway. I certainly didn't.All you need to know is this: Cage is back as Benjamin Franklin Gates, and now he's determined to clear the Gates family name when an opportunistic fortune hunter (Ed Harris), floats the theory that Ben's great-great grandfather was one of the group of conspirators who aided and abetted John Wilkes Booth in the Lincoln assassination. Mirth, mayhem, vigorous chases through several different locales in various countries ensues, and none of it is too exciting or too threatening for the kiddies. In other words - all the earmarks of your typical Disney blockbuster.There is some continuity, at least. Jon Voight and Justin Bartha return as Ben's dad and his trusty, put-upon sidekick, respectively. Diane Kruger returns as Ben's now-estranged lady friend and partner in treasure-hunting. (And at least her American accent has gotten a little bit better). Ed Harris is fittingly menacing - a role he seems to specialize in these days - so it's kind of a jolt when his character does a '180' at a certain point (you'll know when that is.) And though I could watch Helen Mirren pull weeds out of her garden, I'm surprised to see her here as Ben's mother, (though she is still terrific.) Plus, we get a HUGE red flag I have learned to spot in any movie that features any kind of political intrigue or drama. In WHAT UNIVERSE, for Christ's sake, would the U.S. President ever be a man as handsome, well-spoken and laden with integrity as Bruce Greenwood? EXACTLY. Anytime I see him and he's playing the Commander-In-Chief, my 'Uh-Oh' Meter zings into the red. And that's not even mentioning the whole linking the Statue of Liberty, the Library of Congress and matching Resolute Desks in the US and England to Mt. Rushmore and the legend of the city of Cibola thing. (DON'T ASK.)So this NATIONAL TREASURE sequel is not a great movie. It may not even be a GOOD movie as far as most rational-thinking movie-watching adults are concerned. But I have wasted two hours on a lot worse films than this. And did I happen to mention it's got HELEN MIRREN???",7,1,2,10 June 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Stay For The Slaughter, Be Stunned By The Surprise
","It is unfortunate that the greatest and most stunning works by the most brilliant directing minds in cinema, are never honored until years after they have wrought their masterpieces, and loosed them upon the world. We may now count Quentin Tarantino in that esteemed company, as KILL BILL, VOL. 2 brings his four-hour opus to its stunning and unexpectedly moving climax.Viewing both volumes together back-to-back is a revelation; you finally come to understand why Tarantino meant his epic to be experienced in one sitting. True, he has used this film as a playground to indulge in his wildest Saturday-morning-Shaolin-slasher-spaghetti-western fantasies, complete with a literally orgiastic streak of over-the-top violence and gore. But for those willing to peer beneath the trappings (and what most would consider travesties), is the single most important element that sweetens the sour blood-and-bile fueled revenge that powers The Bride like a post-feminist Energizer Bunny with a Blade...the redeeming and overwhelming power of love.I've read some posts that actually liken this to some of the great relationship dramas like 'Kramer Vs. Kramer' or 'Ordinary People', and as sick or off the mark as these comparisons may be, trust me on this one: actually, they're not. And that is about as much as I can say without dropping the spoiler that ties both parts of KB together.I've already ranted enough about QT as an auteur; what deserves just as many kudos is the eye and the feel he has for selecting exactly the right actors for the right roles. As the benevolent-yet-malevolent Bill, David Carradine will probably never again have a role of this caliber in the remainder of his career. Ditto the fearless Michael Madsen as Bud, and Daryl Hannah, who erases whatever sympathy we felt for her in BLADE RUNNER by playing supreme snake-bitch Elle Driver with balls-to-the-wall panache, and whose comeuppance is about as gruesome and fitting as anything you'd find in other QT films.And then, there's Uma. Not even Meryl Streep could show as much passion and complete commitment to a role as Uma has done with The Bride, and Meryl is considered the best we have; our American equivalent of a Dame Judi Dench or an Emma Thompson. Because so many members of the Academy will be turned off by the 'fanboy-fantasia' portion of KB, they may never even notice how with seeming effortlessness and uncanny grace, she crosses every emotional boundary an actress can in a single role, and then travels the arc again backwards, charting The Bride's trial-by-fire and transformation from vengeful Valkyrie, to someone so tender and loving that it seems impossible to find those dualities existing in the same persona.Which brings us back to the very spine of this revenge/passion play. Even in the midst of people so seemingly evil and unredeemable, that you'd never want to get within three hundred miles of them in real life, it's all about love. How its loss can wound us, twist us, tear us apart, destroy our lives and drive us to seek to destroy others. And how finding it, whether for the first time or for that most fortunate of second chances, can transform, heal and uplift us in ways that no words in our language can accurately describe.But then again, hasn't that always been one of the hallmarks of QT's work?I hope that in my lifetime, this gifted filmmaker does truly receive the recognition he deserves. And not when he's nearly on his deathbed or in a wheelchair.For KILL BILL, in its entirety: Five Stars. My highest recommendation.",Null,0,1,23 August 2004
Scarface," Abandon all subtlety, ye who enter here...
","It was twenty years ago, probably at this very moment, that I hurried to the theater as a rabid fan of all things Brian De Palma, anxious to see this movie after all the controversy it had stirred up. The threats of an 'X' rating because of the excessive violence and language, the anger it had raised in the Cuban community at the portrayals of the main characters, (and none of the principal actors were Latino, either!), and just the sheer fact that it was teaming up one of the hottest directors of the day, no stranger to controversy by any means, with another maverick figure: writer/director Oliver Stone.Stone and De Palma. If that's not an indicator of what you should expect from this kind of movie, consider also that it was De Palma's first foray into the genre of gangster films, (to be followed later by CARLITO'S WAY and THE UNTOUCHABLES.) The big splash he made into the horror pool with CARRIE was no fluke, by any means, and he had no intention of making any less of an impression this time around.Mission accomplished. This unquestionably OTT Eighties-centric fable which is part-Shakespeare, part-Sam Peckinpah and everything in between answers the age-old question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?So begins the story of one Tony Montana (Pacino), a lucky beneficiary of Castro's Mariel boat lift back in 1980. Fidel was kind enough to send us a wide representation of Cuban society, including some of the best, but heavy on a lot of the worst, (Mr. Montana definitely included.) With best buddy Manny (Bauer), Tony proceeds to carve a name for himself into the Miami Underworld...which is literally how he begins to find his fortune. He's off and running with the assassination of a former Castro sympathizer, as a favor to crime bigwig George Lopez (Robert Loggia.) From there he makes it into the Big Leagues, wresting control from Lopez lackey Oscar Suarez, (F. Murray Abraham), getting in good with Lopez and eventually with Colombian kingpin Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar.) Once he sets his sights on his boss' girl, the comely moll Elvira Hancock (Michele Pfeiffer), is when SOME of the trouble begins.On the other hand, there is the matter of his less-than-happy homecoming, as he faces his estranged mother and discovers that his baby sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in her first major role), isn't quite a baby anymore, but DEFINITELY a babe. A fact that stirs something more than just a little brotherly in Tony...which proves to be another nail in his coffin...But why go on and on about the details? Most of you reading this have already seen it more than once or twice, (and apparently, so has Quentin Tarantino. You'll laugh out loud at some of the obvious visual references from SCARFACE that turn up in KILL BILL, VOLUME ONE, which makes this movie seem quaint when it comes to violence.)For those who haven't, I can't stress enough how important it is that you accept it as a film that is still, obviously, a product of its time, (note the hair, costumes, cars, sets and MOST of all, the Giorgio Moroder score.) And even with that said, how hopefully, you will appreciate the commitment that all the principal actors made to their performances, especially the moment that the movie turns the corner, going from tragic crime drama to terrific camp with the blink of an eye, (or more accurately, the snort of a nostril.)But to temper commentary that may seem judgmental, maybe there is no way that a story of this scope COULD be told with any sense of subtlety. Even though Pacino does manage to sneak in some moments of surprising pathos here and there. Plus, with a treasure trove of character actors speaking in outrageous, almost Pythonian Latino accents, how can you not have a ball with this in spite of yourself? (Though kudos should go to OZ favorite Mark Margolis, for actually speaking Spanish in his role as if it were his first language.)And yeah, KILL BILL'S current influence not withstanding, the infamous 'chainsaw-in-the-shower' sequence still packs a mean wallop, proving as always that what you DON'T see is just as affecting as what you do...Everyone in this film (and the makers themselves) have done better and worse work since SCARFACE'S initial release. If all you want to know is: is this film really worth the price of a rental? My answer would have to be an emphatic 'F--k, yeah!'And if you can't find it, rent WHITE HEAT instead. Same results, with better acting.",Null,0,1,23 November 2003
Lucky Number Slevin," Darkly Entertaining In Spite Of Itself...
","Thanks in no small part to the juggernaut that was THE USUAL SUSPECTS, the crime film genre developed a whole new subset of 'wisenheimer', noirish capers dripping with as much irony and faux-witty sarcasm as blood and brains, (as in on the wall, not as in the smart kind.) Many of these movies nearly break their own arms patting themselves on the back for their smug cleverness. Common attributes are: low-life gangsters with funny names, people on the wrong side of the tracks who talk sometimes as if they've read too much Sartre or Shakespeare, and double-jointed plot twists that always have that 'Keyser Soze'-style 'GOTCHA!' at the end.Into the fray, along with films like CRANK, SHOOT 'EM UP and the more superior LAYER CAKE, comes LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN. Only I'm not going to trash it, number one - because in spite of all the tough-guys-with-a-twist trappings, it's still an admirable little film, and number two - I have a bias I must admit to here. The author of the screenplay, Jason Smilovic, was one of the creative forces behind KAREN SISCO, one of the best detective shows never to be given the chance that it truly deserved, and he gets instant brownie points from me for that reason alone. SLEVIN, in case you were in a coma and missed the oft-shown trailers when this hit theaters, is one of those 'mistaken identity' scenarios. Slevin (Josh Hartnett) is a poor shlub who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Breezing into town to help a buddy out with a business deal that's not going so well, he finds out how bad things REALLY are when, mistaken for his friend Nick, Slevin becomes embroiled in a deadly game of 'an eye for an eye' going on between two major underworld players: The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and his former compadre turned bitter enemy, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley). Interested parties include Nick's neighbor and intermittent girlfriend, Lindsey (Lucy Liu in a role that's a far cry from her usual stuff, and a DECENT role at that!), a not-so-honorable cop (Stanley Tucci) and the mysterious 'Mr. Goodkat' (Bruce Willis), a pro hit-man so badass that nobody even knows what he looks like. Of course, in the same vein as THE USUAL SUSPECTS, nothing is at all what it seems - not the characters or even the plot itself, yet if you've seen enough of these things, you will know where this is going before it even reaches the halfway mark. At least director Paul McGuigan is savvy enough to just let his cast do their thing, which they do very well, (Freeman plays far too few villains, so this is a treat, and Kingsley will never rival his work in SEXY BEAST, but he keeps it low-key here. And Willis shows why he's becoming such an in-demand specialist in quick but memorable cameos.)Hartnett does a pretty good job shouldering the lead role, though he sometimes seems so glib and clueless, you get a secret sense of satisfaction as various thugs and members of law enforcement smack him around at the moments that you'd actually like to. (There's a reason for his 'WTF' attitude, but it's a spoiler, so you'll have to watch the movie to find out where it comes from.)All-in-all, I've spent more time watching much worse movies. LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN is hardly the next 'USUAL SUSPECTS' or 'FARGO', but it'll do on a TV-sluggish Saturday night.And just for any KAREN SISCO fans out there - keep your eyes peeled for a VIP cameo at the end by one of that show's most endearing players.",8,1,3,1 February 2008
Training Day," Mephisto Waltz in Blue
","'When you dance with the Devil, the Devil don't change. He changes YOU.'--Joaquin Phoenix in 8MMIt doesn't happen too often, that a line from one movie can perfectly sum up the plot of another, but there it is.  Warts and all, there's still something about unsung, neo-noir cop thrillers like 8MM, RUSH, TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. and FORT APACHE: THE BRONX that stays with you.  This may not necessarily be a good thing, but unlike something as insipid as AMERICAN PIE 2, for example, at least they make an indelible impression.Add TRAINING DAY to that list. What makes the movie different from others of its stripe, is no brain-twisting mystery whatsoever. What could've been your usual, by-the-numbers, good cop/bad cop thriller, not worth a hot minute in theaters and even less than that on the video store shelf, is elevated by a ferociously good performance at its center. And that performance, of course, belongs to Denzel Washington, taking his career of noble, high-minded 'saintly' roles and giving it a welcome, vigorous shake.To say that undercover narc Det. Alonzo Harris is a bad man, is like saying that Bluebeard could've used a little marriage counseling. There's no way to simplify it in such pat terms. Somewhere underneath the layers of street cred that have hardened over the years into a thick, nearly impenetrable shell, a blue knight who has given over to the seductive darkness of thug life is buried alive. The young idealist who once wanted to 'protect and serve' is still in there. You can catch glimpses of him, but less in the eyes of Harris, than in the face of his anxious but ready-to-please 'street virgin' partner, Jake Hoyt, well-played by Ethan Hawke.Jake thinks he can do whatever it takes to gain entry into the narc squad, and use it as a stepladder to reach his ultimate goal, which is to someday make Chief, and actually have his own precinct. But young Jake has got to survive his initial trial-by-fire first, and nothing he's learned in the academy has prepared him for what it's like to roll down the streets of South Central, with a truly original Bad Man.The Oscar controversy has left a taint on this picture that is prejudicial and unfair, and the truth is that if Russell Crowe had won, the clamoring din of critics who would've screamed about how it would've been a consolation prize YET AGAIN for his astounding work in THE INSIDER, wouldn't have been quite as loud as the naysayers are now regarding Denzel.Both actors are remarkable craftsmen, and both have never 'phoned-in' a performance in any of the movies I've seen them in, regardless of what the genre is.  If Denzel didn't deserve the award for this movie, as many have whined, then I say that he should have it for the simple fact that he has been doing great work LONGER than Russell Crowe. Bottom line.Am I biased? I would say yes. Did the Best Actor award smack of a popularity contest? I would say definitely to some degree, but when HASN'T the 'you-like-me-you-REALLY-like-me' factor not affected the Oscars?  Regarding nomination of the best performance given, let me just say this. Russell, just in terms of acting ability, hits one out of the park as John Nash in A BEAUTIFUL MIND. High profile project, A-list director, a storyline that is virtual catnip to any Hollyweird producer. Personal ethics and public behavior aside, looking at Russell's past body of work, THIS WAS NOT A SURPRISE. This was a sure thing, a SAFE thing.Considering Denzel's past achievements, the very last thing you would count on, is to see him give a Class-A performance in what could've easily been a grade-Z movie. If TRAINING DAY had come out at the same time as BOYZ 'N' THE HOOD, MENACE II SOCIETY, SUGAR HILL or NEW JACK CITY, with a star like Laurence Fishburne or Ving Rhames, there wouldn't have even been a debate. Don't get me wrong; these are both two fine actors, but Alonzo Harris is the kind of part we've seen them both play before. Nothing new there. But Denzel has NEVER played a villain before, let alone one as complex as this. And he did it BEAUTIFULLY. For that, he now has gold for his mantle. Case closed.Ethan Hawke holds his own with Denzel's riveting presence, taking what could've been the cliched, fresh-faced rookie role and putting just enough spin on it, so that when Jake Hoyt is a little more wary, battle-tested and world-weary by the end, we can completely buy it. Very few of today's crop of 'youngsters' could have believably pulled it off.Antoine Fuqua (REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) has been down this road before, and the gritty, jittery, paranoia-laced uncertainty of the streets deposits a ball of tension in your gut from the opening frames and winds it ever tighter throughout the movie. South Central has never looked meaner, and it reminds us that for all the glamour we see on TV and in magazines and, yes, in the movies, L.A. has the same kind of scaly underbelly that all major cities have, and because of cops like Alonzo and Jake, good or bad, you might be lucky enough to never have to experience it first hand.So if there is anything faulty about TRAINING DAY, it lies not in the performances of its award-nominated leads, Fuqua's sure-handed direction, or the almost three-dimensional photographic style of the excellent DP Mauro Fiore. TRAINING DAY'S main downfall lies in the factor that bears at least 75% importance in determining whether or not a movie will get made, even before the budgeting: the casting.For that 'extra touch' of street cred, not to mention guaranteeing the attraction of a certain demographic, no less than Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray and Dr. Dre stroll through in cameos, as a disabled crack dealer, a 'ghetto-fabulous' hoochie, and one of Harris' men, respectively. All these performers have either lived or seen 'the life' in one way or another, and none of them have to go 'Method' or 'find their motivation,' so you expect them to be good, and they are. The problem? Their presence, no matter how fleeting, is a jolting reminder that you are watching a movie, and that is what keeps DAY from being more than just a good film cemented by two great leads.Even more distracting, though, are the other supporting players, all of whom are at the top of their game here, but their appearances toss the hard-won realism right out the window.  Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Raymond J. Barry, Harris Yulin, Cliff Curtis and Raymond Cruz are among the well-meaning culprits, a who's-who of the type that we used to see a lot of, back when Clint was still busting heads as Harry Callahan. However, to the credit of the casting director(s) and the producers, I think we, the public, are savvy enough by now to know that without these vets, replaced instead by a bunch of no-names, no matter how talented they were, TRAINING DAY might still be a script sitting in the bottom of screenwriter David Ayer's desk drawer.That said, this is no feel-good romp, no buddy-buddy cop thriller where an Eddie Murphy or a Chris Rock will cut the tension with a well-placed, profanity-laced quip or two. Even with its obvious drawbacks, TRAINING DAY is still better than most films of its type, and more than worth your dime and your time.",Null,1,11,31 March 2002
In Bruges," Nothing Else Like It...
","Just when I was seriously lamenting the lack of any originality in film-making in the past few months, along comes IN BRUGES to prove me dead wrong, and I'm glad for it! Wonderfully impossible to classify, it ranks right up there with the best of the Coen Brothers' blackly funny crime romps like FARGO, BLOOD SIMPLE and THE BIG LEBOWSKI, yet swirls in the best parts of Guy Ritchie's 'geezer' films as well, with just a dash of existential angst for flavor. Mature, sanguine Ray (HARRY POTTER'S Brendan Gleeson) and his hot-headed yet soft-hearted protégé Ken (a fantastic Colin Farrell) have been ordered by their boss to spend a few days cooling their heels in the picturesque, Medieval city of Bruges in Belgium, after an 'assignment' they were taking care of backfires in a completely horrific way. Oh, did I happen to mention that the two buddies are hit men, and that it's Ken's actions that fouled up their latest 'job'?The two men's polar opposite reactions to this quaint European city tell so much about the characters, and both actors take every opportunity they've been given and run with it. Gleeson, who's done everything from horror (28 DAYS LATER), to comedy (THE SNAPPER) to a combination of both (LAKE PLACID) shines here as the seasoned vet, and Farrell, who's had a real tough time picking projects that make the most of his considerable talent, has never been better. Against this postcard-ready backdrop, like a rumpled, modern-day answer to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Ray and Ken ponder the ironic finality of death, the perplexing puzzle of life and what their part in it really is, and how anyone could (or could not) spend their lives living in 'f***ing Bruges'. While they wait to hear from Harry, their boss (the excellent Ralph Fiennes, who doesn't show up until halfway in, but blows us away when he does), they while away the time sight-seeing and sampling the local beer. A movie shoot taking place in the town square figures prominently, as the movie pokes fun at itself with wry and refreshing self-awareness. A beautiful local girl named Chloe (Clemence Poesy) and a dwarf named Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), both connected in their own way to the movie-within-the-movie, figure prominently in the events that occur later that affect both men in a way that both shatters and surprises.Irish playwright Martin McDonagh wears both writer and director hats here for the first time, and both fit him like a glove. The dialogue is very realistic, with just enough whimsy to delight the audience and define the characters without being too clever or precious about it. And the dark, bitter ending offsets the movie's earlier sweetness just right...sort of like really good Belgian chocolate, like the kind I'm sure you can get...IN BRUGES. Kudos to everyone involved for producing a marvelous piece that feels independent but not contrived.",9,1,3,14 July 2008
Star Trek," Back At Full (Warp) Speed...
","When it was first announced that J.J. Abrams (LOST, FRINGE) was being handed the keys to the Roddenberry kingdom, I couldn't have felt more trepidation. LOST had me in its grip until about the end of the second season, when things started to get way too 'TWIN PEAKS-ish' for me and I bailed out. Ditto with FRINGE, which just managed to escape the pitfalls of becoming 'X-FILES ULTRA PLUS.' But damned if they didn't manage it. Abrams, writers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci and producer Damon Lindelof have turned out to be the 'vitamin B-12 complex' shot that this ailing series needed in its behind parts, and they have done it while still remaining mostly true to the characters and ideals held dear by devoted fans everywhere. Best of all, because of the way it has been cleverly written and directed, you need not have seen a single frame of any of the many entries in the franchise to appreciate what Team Abrams hath wrought. The casting is dead solid perfect. Chris Pine is the exact combination of bravado, recklessness fueled by a testosterone overload and the unflappable courage of feckless youth we knew that James Tiberius Kirk was in his younger days. Not one time does he hit a false note, and the 'Shatnerisms' are completely avoided (until a certain point...you'll know when that is, but by then, you won't even mind.)HEROES' Zachary Quinto and THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK'S Karl Urban are nothing less than astonishing as the younger Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy, respectively. Both actors avoid imitating their predecessors as well, and both deliver skillful performances without turning into the SNL caricatures we were afraid they would be. Urban is especially unexpected, capturing the physicality, the vocal inflections and the mindset of the great DeForest Kelly's performance in what can only be described as a loving tribute to the character. And Quinto should be ready to kiss his TV career as the chimerical Gabriel Sylar goodbye. The impression he leaves here as Spock will find him facing all the good and bad aspects of being associated with such an icon of the series. One would hope he already discussed this with the original Spock, Leonard Nimoy, who well into his twilight years, can still hold our rapt attention on-screen, and plays a pivotal part in the storyline of this new alternate version. The moments he shares with the key members of the youthful cast are both energizing and poignant with their symbolic importance. You can almost see the torch being passed again, into very capable hands. As the beautiful and brainy Uhura, Zoe Saldana does Nichelle Nichols proud as her new incarnation, and I hope the revered singer/actress is flattered, because Saldana really brings it, completely unfettered by the chauvinism that hog-tied so many of the strong and capable females featured in the canon back during its inception. John Cho (HAROLD AND KUMAR), Simon Pegg (SHAUN OF THE DEAD) and Anton Yelchin round out the principal cast as Sulu, Scotty and Chekhov respectively. Though they are given woefully little to do compared to the leads, (and this really is more about Kirk and Spock than anyone else), each makes the most of the moment they were given to shine. I kind of had my doubts about Yelchin as Chekhov first because of the accent that veers dangerously into stand-up comedian territory, but if one thinks back to Walter Koenig creating the role, you realize that the accent didn't sound all that convincing at first then, either. Plus, for lovers of the vital secondary characters important in the lives of the core characters, as well as serial movie buffs who love to play 'name that actor', there are plenty of juicy surprises that I will not reveal here. I do need to mention the outstanding performance of Eric Bana as the villain of this particular piece, the deranged and inconsolable Romulan captain Nero. A little more time should have been given to this character to give us deeper insight into his motivation, so that his evil deeds are given even more chilling and despicable power, thereby making our heroes' actions that much more noble.There are plenty of nods to TREK folklore and insular references that die-hard fans will lap up like Ben and Jerry's, and the tag lines that certain characters are known for that will elicit applause and delighted laughter as they should. I have not been this excited about the success of a TREK-themed film since the very first time I saw WRATH OF KHAN, and this is definitely on par with that installment, considered by many to be the best TREK sequel ever made. Which brings to mind the one key thing to remember here - this is not a sequel, or a 'reimagining' or even a prequel. Much in the spirit of what Chris Nolan did with BATMAN and Richard Donner achieved with SUPERMAN, this is a new lease on life for an old friend.I have heard the tag-line 'This is not your father's STAR TREK,' used to the point where it should drive me to complete distraction bordering on insanity. But I can't think of a more apt way to describe it. There was only two ways this project could go, warts and all - it could become a complete and utter failure, very close to the ill-advised ENTERPRISE series, or it could be that once- in-a-great while success that blows the doors off everyone's expectations.So which is it? To use a horse-racing reference, Team Abrams' new entry is the 'Mine That Bird' of the franchise. It's official, folks. STAR TREK is back - full ahead, maximum warp speed!",9,3,12,9 May 2009
Fight Club," The 'Clockwork Orange' Of The New Millennium...
","What Anthony Burgess had to say about the nature of violence, nihilism, sex, death and What It All Means was underlined by Stanley Kubrick's film of his brilliant novel A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.What Burgess and Kubrick did for their time, now author Chuck Palahniuk and director David Fincher have done for theirs with FIGHT CLUB. But watching both films back to back, (if you dare,) you can see that the comparison between the two is anything but a simple one.For one thing, Fincher uses Palahniuk's novel as a blueprint to address so many issues and concerns of our times with an urgency that makes Kubrick's ORANGE look like it's standing still, building a message-laden story that dwarfs the earlier film with its devastating power, hidden in plain sight as it is.There is a song from, of all things, the CITY OF ANGELS soundtrack, 'Iris' by the Goo-Goo Dolls, that contains one line that sums up the entire plot of FIGHT CLUB in a nutshell....'Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive...'But crack open that nutshell, and within it you'll find all the questions you never dared asked before about yourself. Who are you now, where are you going, where would you like to be? WHO would you like to be?
Using the darkest side of the human condition as a mirror, Fincher has turned that mirror towards us before with SE7EN and THE GAME. With FIGHT CLUB, he has gone more layers deeper than this forum has space to contemplate.Just watch it with an open mind, with friends who can do the same. Then watch it together several more times, and then discuss it. You'll be surprised at some of the questions the film inspires you to come up with. And the answers, if you find them...",Null,1,3,21 November 2000
Shaun of the Dead," When it comes to the 'RomZomCom', this movie is DEAD on target!
","Poor Shaun. A twenty-something on the nearer end of 30, he's got a dead-end job at the electronics store where he works, a dead-ending relationship that his pretty (and pretty BORED) girlfriend wants to deep-six, a flat-lining rapport with his doting mum and disapproving stepdad, and various friends, neighbors, acquaintances and the like who are just...DEAD.No, I take that back. UN-dead.Like the best and brightest Python skit taken to extremes that would even raise THEIR eyebrows, SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a breath of fresh, fetid air in a genre that's been DYING for a bite of good, solid, comic irony. The truly talented Simon Pegg, who plays Shaun with the right combination of distress and deadpan humor, also co-wrote the script with Edgar Wright, and boy, do they know their movies! Good thing, too, because as so many satirists before them have demonstrated, you have to truly love whatever the issue or thing is that you're poking fun at.But this is not simply some NAKED GUN or SCARY MOVIE copycat here. The quality that makes the humor/horror/heartbreak chemistry cook, is the realness of the relationships that have been developed between the characters, as well as all the details of their lives which the audience can readily relate to. Going through the daily grind of his life, mired in his own sense of misery and ennui, Shaun barely notices the changes taking place in the world around him as the dead begin to rise and walk, and we all laugh knowingly, because we've all had times when we feel that way, and more often than not.The social commentary (a nod to George Romero's brilliant worldview presented so effectively in DAWN OF THE DEAD, to which this film pays loving homage) is what elevates SHAUN to a level far beyond the usual gut-munch extrava-GORE-za. And it poses some really interesting questions! Aren't all of us in some ways a lot like Shaun, with aspects of our lives that are just like his? And the people around us, zoned out into their own little worlds the same way we all are. If they died and came back to life as zombies, would we actually notice? If it happened to us, would THEY notice? But before things get too philosophical, there is so much more to SHAUN that can be appreciated. Besides the outstanding performances from everyone, with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost taking the lead as Our Hero and Ed, his ne'er-do-ANYTHING-well best bud, this movie is damn near flawless script-wise and technically as well. There is a sequence near the film's beginning done in one continuous take that De Palma would envy, and Hitchcock would be proud of, and if you've seen this movie you know exactly what I'm talking about. What makes it so fascinating and startlingly funny is all the little background details you can spot, which of course Shaun is oblivious to. Even better is the second time around, when the sequence is repeated, but things are VASTLY different. It's so well done, that it may take repeat viewings to pick out everything you missed the previous time.Well, I have never seen SPACED, and probably won't get the chance unless they show the reruns on BBC America. But if SHAUN is any indication of what the cast of that show is capable of on the usual episode, I'll have to keep an eye on the listings.But for lovers of horror, the zombie genre, or just a good black comedy with something different to offer, look no further. We were fortunate enough to get a DAWN remake that didn't suck, but if you want to do better than just a movie with 'minimal suckage,' don't rent this one. BUY IT. That way you can save the money you'd be spending otherwise on repeated rentals, because you WILL be watching this more than once. Trust me.",9,1,2,23 April 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," If You Want MORE, You've GOT IT!!!
","It's pretty much a rule written in stone about sequels: if you want to be as successful with a follow-up as you were with the original, you MUST raise your game. If you had glamour the first time around, it has to be MORE glamorous. The suspense must be MORE suspenseful, the gore gorier, the flash flashier...well, you get the picture.With the track record of such gems as INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and STAR TREK 2: THE WRATH OF KHAN, I was hoping that the creative crew behind the first PIRATES would bear all of these in mind, and join them in their glorious achievements, instead of coming up with something as downright awful as, say, SPEED 2. I needn't have worried.The magic is definitely back, and DEAD MAN'S CHEST is probably the best sequel you will see all year. If MORE is what you've been craving, you'll have a full belly before this one is even half-over! No time is wasted jumping right into where BLACK PEARL left off. A morose Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) thinks she's been left at the altar by fiancée Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), but such is not the case. Soon she, Will and even her father, Gov. Weatherbee Swann (Jonathan Pryce) will all be arrested for aiding and abetting one Capt. Jack Sparrow in Part One. But there's more treachery afoot here than even a pirate could dream up. Certain 'agents' representing the East India Trading Company want possession of Jack's mystic compass. The compass is the key to finding yet another key...the one that opens up that object of fabled myth, Davy Jones' locker. And anyone who can grab what's inside the locker can ultimately control the Seven Seas.And that's just going into what THEY want. Jack Sparrow wants the key to the locker to escape a fate far worse than death...an eternity of servitude as one of Jones' crustacean-encrusted crew, on board the hellish ghost ship The Flying Dutchman, to fulfill a debt that Jack never repaid. (BIG surprise.) So yes, MORE story is only the tip of the iceberg here. Bloom and Knightley as the prettiest characters in the cast have much more to do, but they also go through more changes. A lot of their naiveté has gone since their last misadventures with Sparrow, and a lot more will disappear before the movie's end. It's rather refreshing to see that even the 'good guys' here can have some conflicted moral dilemmas to work through.And yes, dear Jack. What was shocking before has now become normal, even almost endearing, as this swashbuckling stew of Keith Richards, Pepe le Pew and maybe even a little Prince thrown in for extra flavor, slashes and sashays his way from one predicament to the next with a boozy, blustery bonhomie.Not to be outdone is Bill Nighy as the fearsome Captain Jones, who projects both melancholy and menace through some of the ookiest CGI layers since Andy Serkis got behind Gollum. You won't see a more frightening or fascinating villain this summer. And new addition Naomie Harris (28 DAYS LATER) as the eerie swamp witch Tia Dalma, sinks her teeth into the pivotal role like it was a seven-course gourmet meal. She HAS to come back for Part Three!I so want to go over how great each returning cast member and character was, but I'll let you plumb the depths of those surprises and pleasures yourself. Gore Verbinski, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and Jerry Bruckheimer will be happy to know that their sequel definitely goes into the Hall of Fame with the other heavy hitters, (and that's before you even take into account the dizzying box-office returns.) It does run a little long at over two hours, but for pure entertainment, you won't want to miss this one. And if what you're already getting wasn't enough, wait until you get a gander at the gasp-inducing ending. Not since EMPIRE STRIKES BACK or the first KILL BILL has there been a climax that has you climbing the walls and yelling 'NOOOO! What happens NEXT???' See ya in about two years, when they answer THAT question...",9,4,7,5 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Disney Drops Anchor, But Not The Ball!
","Though we were too late to get tickets for it, my partner and I had the good fortune (and timing) to be in Anaheim when the world premiere for PIRATES was taking place. It was his umpteenth time at Disneyland, my very first, (at age 43, yet!!!) For him, it was a revelation about seeing the Magic Kingdom through adult eyes vs. the awestruck vision of a young teenager. Even more so for me, since coming to the Magic Kingdom had been virtually all I dreamed about after seeing it so many times on 'The Wonderful World of Disney.' Needless to say, though I pretty much enjoyed myself there, a lot of the more kid-friendly attractions simply left me cold, or at the very most, lukewarm. At the top of the list of things that left me less-than-impressed? Pirates-of-the-Caribbean: The Ride.The goofy joy tempered with thrills and chills that I remember, seeing the ride on a show about Disneyland itself (which has been thoughtfully included on the POTC DVD extras) was totally dissipated by a sense of ghastly horror...horror at the fact that the ride hadn't changed in nearly twenty years!!! You could even see the places on some of the animatronic figures where they had simply been patched up with spit, chewing gum and chicken wire! Even after seeing the previews, which were exciting in that bombastic Jerry Bruckheimer-way, I remember thinking as I got off the ride, 'Ohmigod. Disney is gonna lose their shirts on this one.' A big budget feature based on a dilapidated theme park attraction, set in a genre that had been considered dead since that disaster known as CUTTHROAT ISLAND? What chance could Disney have of possibly turning this sow's ear into a silk purse loaded with gold doubloons? Not a single one. But miracle of miracles, they pulled it off!!! Every so often, Hollywood puts together a project guaranteed to be an absolute disaster. The director is anything but a veteran, the leading man is way too quirky, unpredictable or just plain difficult, the script comes from writers who are hit-and-miss at best, and the producers are known for their plot-free, bloated behemoths of sunscreen-weather blockbusters. The end result? Like a Rube Goldberg contraption, the damn thing may actually work, but that doesn't mean it will do anything or go anywhere.Yet, with Gore Verbinski (THE RING, MOUSE HUNT) at the helm, Jerry Bruckheimer (BAD BOYS 2, ENEMY OF THE STATE) producing, a script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (GODZILLA) and the inscrutable Johnny Depp in the lead, PIRATES takes the disgraced and abandoned niche of pirate movies and brings it back to life with a bang and a 'yo ho ho!' in a way not seen since the days of the original TREASURE ISLAND or CAPTAIN BLOOD.Not only that, but the film still manages to give plenty of 'nudge-wink' references to the ride upon which it is based, while still entertaining you in a wildly reckless and gleeful way that all but obliterates the memory of the original experience from your senses. Should they ever redesign and revamp the ride, they now have the blueprint for it.And speaking of blueprints, I'm astonished at myself for actually looking forward to the sequel, (and that's even without the famously rumored appearance of the Stones' Keith Richard as Jack Sparrow's miserable excuse for a father.) Bringing back the fresh, naive heroism of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, who could use a solid hit right about now), the feisty sexiness of Elizabeth Turner (Keira Knightley, who has become famous for that very quality in her heroines) and the murderously jovial sensibility of Geoffrey Rush's scenery-chewing Captain Barbossa is the smartest move the filmmakers could've made.Let's just hope that for this series, PIRATES 2 is more like THE GODFATHER 2, and not SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL.",8,0,3,26 February 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Hardscrabble Hearts
","The middle of the heartland, circa 1960's. The beginnings of rumblings signaling social changes and upheavals are far, far away. Out here, in the beautiful, raw and desolate expanse of the land of states like Wyoming and Colorado, the subject of the day is not about racism, classism, feminism, any 'ism' you could name in the big city. It's all about survival.Against this bleak backdrop, two men, one a ranch-hand, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), the other a sometime rodeo cowboy, Jack Twist, (Jake Gyllenhaal), come looking for that rarest of finds in a time of hardship: a well-paying job. They do find work, yet against the picturesque and isolated setting of a place known as Brokeback Mountain, they discover something even more startling, wonderful, miraculous and inescapable...they find love. In each others arms and hearts.Some movies serve as a call to change. The way we think, feel and see about things which we thought we knew well, and took a stand on. Some movies don't just merely call for change, but cause it, simply by being what they are. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is the latter of those special films...a movie that quietly wraps its sad and gentle hands around your heart, squeezes firmly and refuses to let go, even weeks after you've seen it...the FIRST time.The team of Ang Lee, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, Rodrigo Prieto, Gustavo Santoalalla, Marit Allen and every single person involved with breathing life into E. Annie Proulx's heartbreaking tale have outdone themselves...and undone audiences across the land who walked in expecting a gay cowboy story, only to come out transformed by a timeless tale of love found, love lost, and love still sustained in the face of impossible antagonism, prejudice and ultimately, violence.There is no quibbling over who gave the best performance doing what. Both Heath and Jake have forever etched their names into the firmament of classic film actors with their uncompromising performances. Ditto the beautiful work by Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini and Roberta Maxwell. Ang Lee has made sure that this is a movie where no part is too small or insignificant. Even Randy Quaid's brief appearance makes a considerable and ominous impression.This is not a movie for very young kids, and even not one for older kids to view without their parents or older family members. But for anyone else who has a heart and has had it broken, gay, straight or otherwise inclined; if you are a human being with a soul, there is no way you will not be moved.And to answer an oft-asked question: yes, I do believe that the 2005 Oscar for Best Actor will go to Heath Ledger. See him in this movie and then tell me I'm wrong. More importantly, see this movie, PERIOD.I do not award films with a rating of '10' lightly...I'm happy to say that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has earned the right to that score, and then some.",10,25,30,4 January 2006
Zodiac," Chilling Account Of America's Ultimate Serial Killer/Stalker...And The Men Who Stalked HIM...
","JULY 4th, 1969The late Sixties kicked off a time of tremendous social upheaval and cultural change, not to mention the political turmoil being fueled by our continuing involvement in Vietnam. For the most part, though, in the idyllic town of Vallejo, California, the people seemed mostly untouched by all the chaos swirling around in the rest of the country.Until this night.On a deserted lover's lane, a young couple is brutally gunned down, shot multiple times by an unknown assailant. The male half of the couple somehow manages to survive the ordeal. His girlfriend is not so fortunate.And that's how the story of ZODIAC begins.Having seen an earlier, low-budget version of the story that clocked in at just under ninety minutes, I couldn't figure out how in the hell director David Fincher was going to hold my attention for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. Without a new and different way of telling the story, I pretty much anticipated ditching this one early, regardless of who was in it. And this rendition brings out the big guns: Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Chloe Sevigny, Elias Koteas, Brian Cox, Philip Baker Hallthe list is impressive.Well, as it turns out, so is the movie. Told with that matter-of-factness that we've come to expect and enjoy from police procedurals like CSI and LAW AND ORDER on the small screen, ZODIAC goes a whole lot deeper than those shows, to give us better insight into both the kind of man who would commit such ghastly, murderous acts, and more importantly, the kind of men obsessed enough to want to catch him at literally any cost. Based on the book by author Robert Graysmith, it's Gyllenhaal who actually plays him in the movie; a squeaky-clean editorial cartoonist working for the San Francisco 'Chronicle' in 1969 when the story breaks. He's like a kid with his nose pressed to the window of a neighborhood bar, where all the grown-ups go; he wants to be as important and respected and hip as the guys who write the 'big' stories, but he can never gain the access to that world he craves. That's only until he meets crime reporter Paul Avery (Downey Jr.), who is as perplexed and intrigued by the Zodiac Killer's taunting letters and weird, cryptic ciphers which he demands the local papers publish to avoid more deaths on the streets. He's not quite as taken with the socially inept and naïve Graysmithuntil he finds out that Robert is a puzzle aficionado whose infatuation with them gives him the aptitude to help crack Zodiac's messagesand maybe provide some badly needed insight into the killer himself.Unwittingly intertwined with the destinies of the two newspaper flacks is the investigating officer, Inspector David Toschi (Ruffalo) and his partner, William Armstrong (ER's Anthony Edwards.) The animal-cracker addicted cop attacks the case much like an animal  a bloodhound  as he sniffs out every clue obsessively, probing, questioning, eventually winding up living, breathing and sleeping the case like someone who lost a family member to it. I can't recall the last time I saw a crime drama that so widely covers all angles of a true event  maybe Richard Brooks' masterpiece IN COLD BLOOD, the granddaddy of true crime thrillers, or Richard Fleischer's riveting THE BOSTON STRANGLER. Yes, the required reenactments of the crimes themselves are played out here, complete with the kind of gory detail that defies you to watch and dares you to look away. But like those other two movies, it makes the story of how the case energizes, engulfs and even destroys the lives of the men driven to find the answers to solve it, where ZODIAC distinguishes itself from any other film of its kind. It's also a great look at the low-tech procedures that the police were limited to compared to today - how sometimes, jurisdictional problems and bureaucratic red-tape (not to mention jealously guarded turf and other issues) sometimes prevented investigators from getting out of each other's way (or their own) long enough to do an effective job.Everyone here is in top form, from the principals right down to the cameos that only amount to a few minutes of time on-screen. But where Fincher really shines is in the scenes that will stand out in your mind forever when you think about the case or this movie. For me, one scene in the third act, which features a gripping performance by Charles Fleischer (A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT), is a chilling, nerve-jangling sequence that captures the creepy essence of the entire film. I won't say too much about it here, but I can guarantee that you'll be on the edge of the couch when you see it.Not really a horror film (but definitely not a horrible one), ZODIAC enriches David Fincher's past body of work, and makes a great companion piece to his other classic crime thriller, SE7EN.",9,1,1,5 December 2008
Cloverfield," Gripping, Terrifying Experience
","Congratulations to director Matt Reeves, writer Drew Goddard, producers J.J. Abrams and Bryan Burk and the cast for creating one of the most unsettling PG-13 rated experiences since THE SIXTH SENSE. If you ever wondered while watching a Godzilla movie, what it must've been like for all the little 'toy' people figures being crushed, exploded and otherwise killed in the monster's rampage, CLOVERFIELD gives you the up-close-and-personal version of what was actually taking place on the ground. A lot of people won't like the 'Blair Witch'-style, first person/shaky-cam method used to tell the story, but this is exactly what sets it apart from and above your 'average' monster mash. Add startling visual and special effects and some believably frightened performances, and what you have here is a movie that is going to be dissected, debated and discussed all the way through 2008, and probably beyond.",9,4,8,22 January 2008
Sleepy Hollow," What More Do You Need To Know...?

Once," A Love Letter to Musicians, Singers and Lovers Everywhere...From Dublin, Ireland to Dublin, Ohio and Back...
","Two of the riskiest genres to work with in movies are romances and musicals. Especially when you add just a touch of comedy here and there. When you mix the two, usually you are just asking for trouble. Sometimes, you get THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG. Other times you get AT LONG LAST LOVE.And then you get the ones that work and become something special...Something the likes of which you've never seen before. Nothing too loud, or precious or sickeningly sweet, but a rare combination of simple beauty and creativity taken to a place that touches the heart like nothing else can.ONCE is such a film, I am so happy to say. Not a lot of people are going to like it, because it's as far from being a 'Hollywood' film as you can get. No explosions, car chases, BIG dramatically 'actor-y' moments or a soundtrack done by the latest chart-toppers on Billboard's Hot 100.This is the story of one Irish Guy (Glen Hansard) and one Czech Girl (Marketa Iglova), who meet, write songs together, bond and fall in love. That's all. Well, no, I need to take that back. It's a story about the connections we make with one another through the things that make us similar, and how it leaves a mark on the heart and soul that can never be erased. And how music is the most powerful and profound way we can make that connection. I saw the Oscars the year that the song 'Falling Slowly' won for Best Song, and though I really liked it, I had no idea why it was chosen. Having seen ONCE now, I'd say the honor was very well-deserved, and it's a shame that it didn't receive more nominations. Hansard and Iglova give wonderfully natural performances, and when they're singing? The movie doesn't get any better than that, whether they duet or sing alone. Writer/director John Carney made a brilliant decision to keep things simple, and the movie clocks in at just under ninety minutes. Funny thing is - when it was over, I didn't feel like I was cheated or that it should've been longer. I won't say how it ends or whether the Guy and Girl's romance is ever consummated, but let's just say the conclusion is...'note-perfect.' (I couldn't resist throwing that in there.)Anyone avoiding this film because it has music or because they're allergic to 'chick-flicks' should be prepared for a pleasant shock. Here is a perfect date movie that should appeal to both halves of a couple...even the cynics.",9,1,3,5 July 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Truly, A 'Fairy Tale For Adults...'
","Anyone looking at the poster art, reading the subject line of this review and not taking it seriously, needs to have their head examined. Although it is basically the story of a little girl, THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S TALE. Go rent THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and let them watch that for the billionth time. At least that won't leave any permanent psychological damage.Now, having said that, PAN'S LABYRINTH is not a film that the grown-up set should miss. We all remember as children, how the true world of fairy tales was a place that could be filled with as much menace, danger and even certain death as it was magic, wonder and all the fantasy your imagination could hold. HELLBOY and THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE director Guillermo del Toro takes you back into this world, and reawakens your inner child in ways you never dreamed of.It is the post-Civil War Spain of 1944, where the uncompromising armies of Franco have claimed victory, and are mercilessly bent on eliminating any forces of resistance. In such a dark time, children are especially helpless subjects to the whims of their adult benefactors, who are capable of dispensing either the most boundless love or the deepest cruelty at will. Caught somewhere in between the two is eleven-year-old Ofelia, (a flawless performance by young Ivana Baquero). With her mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil), who is ill and with child, she travels to the home of her stepfather, the heartless Captain Vidal (a blood-freezing turn by Sergi Lopez, who is so frighteningly good, he almost makes you forget Ralph Fiennes in SCHINDLER'S LIST).Ofelia and Carmen are only under the Captain's protection because Carmen is allegedly carrying the Fascist leader's heir. With her mother mostly too ill to care for her and her stepfather alternating between cruelty and dismissiveness, Ofelia finds comfort only in the attentions of Vidal's brow-beaten housekeeper, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), and in the world of magic and fairy tales she escapes into from the evils of the real adult world.Sitting behind the Captain's mountain home, Ofelia discovers an beautiful old labyrinth, and soon makes her acquaintance with its sole inhabitant, a Faun (Doug Jones, who played Abe Sapien in HELLBOY). Convinced that she is the descendant of the Princess who fled his magical world ages ago, the Faun sets Ofelia to perform three dangerous tasks, that will prove she is truly the Princess and deserves to return to her place in the kingdom of Fauns and Faeries. But the intrusion of the bloody savagery of war cannot be evaded for very long, and soon the dangerous, magical fantasy in which Ofelia is enraptured begins to intertwine with the dramatic and profound events taking place in 'the real world', involving real danger and the deadliest of consequences, until both tales simultaneously reach noble, if tragic conclusions. I want to rant and rave and rant some more for pages on end about this film, but that wouldn't work here. If you are a lover of all kinds of movies, you owe it to yourself not to miss this one. With all the remarkable work that del Toro has already done in the genre world, it's pretty safe to say that PAN'S LABYRINTH is not only his greatest achievement, but that he may never do anything that surpasses it. Yes, THAT'S how good this movie is. Go rent it and see it NOW.",10,1,3,4 December 2008
Blade II," Del Toro charges sequel headfirst; audience sustains concussion.
","Contains Spoilers First of all, not to insult some people's intelligence, but after reading about half of the reviews for BLADE 2, it was more than a little obvious that a lot of you haven't the slightest idea who the hell Guillermo del Toro is. So let me preface this review with a bit of videostore-geek advice: if you did NOT see the first BLADE, rent that. If you have not seen or heard of CRONOS or MIMIC (the first one), hunt those down and rent them, too, if possible. If any of the aforementioned films is not your cuppa blood, go see THE SWEETEST THING, LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT or ICE AGE. Stay as far away from BLADE 2 as your local multraplex will allow.Now, that THAT'S out of the way, how was the movie? As sequels go, I've definitely seen better. As sequels directed by Guillermo del Toro rate, it was nothing less than AMAZING. As with most Marvel/DC-oriented superhero film franchises these days, you always have to begin with the story of the hero's origins, and Stephen Norrington did a more-than-capable job of providing us with that in the first BLADE.  Not a whole lot of character development, (but then what were you expecting, people? For God's sake, it's based on a COMIC BOOK!!)  but Blade's origins, his mission and his relationship with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), were firmly established.With the preliminaries out of the way, it was time for a director to step in, who leaves his mark on a film in a way that few others can, and del Toro definitely ranks among the top twenty in this category. If you have seen any of his other work, you already know that whether the script is a sensation or a stink bomb, he still interprets it in his own unique way. To wit: you don't go to a movie by David Lynch or Oliver Stone expecting to see HEIDI: THE MUSICAL; you won't get that here, either.With a penchant for painting pictures more with darkness than light, a fondness for the supernatural and all the oozy, slimy, slitheriness that goes with it, and an obsession with unearthing the ultraviolent subtext so obviously begging for further exploration in its predecessor, del Toro's BLADE 2 takes the audience and David S. Goyer's script, and shakes them both like a pit bull whose Kibble was recently laced with PCP.Now that he's had a chance to get comfortable with the character, Wesley Snipes now walks and talks Blade as if he created the Daywalker himself, and much like Sean Connery as 007, you'll never be able to picture anyone else making the feeble attempt to essay the role in his place after this. Those looking for stunning dialogue and deeply constructed plot points had better look elsewhere; the plot here is all about providing every opportunity for Blade to kick undead ass, and he does so with a gusto I wish half the other working actors in Hollywood would bring to their roles in 'A'-list pictures.The story is thankfully very simple, and it wisely tackles the question on everyone's mind from the opening frames: if Whistler died in the first installment, what is he doing back in the sequel? After failing to take his own life and being captured by Blade's enemies, the Daywalker has been following his trail for a few years, bent on destroying those who kidnapped Whistler, and determined to bring an end to his mentor's suffering.He finally tracks Whistler to Prague (good for the mythic locale and also the producers, since it's much cheaper to shoot there), where instead of outright killing the old vampire hunter, he helps cure him of his condition, assisted more or less by a new punky sidekick named Scud, (Norman Reedus, who channels David Arquette at his least quirky/annoying).No sooner does the reunion take place, than an elite vampire squad finds the new hideout. Strangely enough, though, they're not here to eradicate Blade and company; they want to strike a bargain. It seems a new, mutant strain of bloodsuckers has somehow evolved, and their primary goal is to drain, infect or destroy all life on the planet, both vampire and human. The 'pure-bred' vamps want to enlist Blade's help to stop the scourge, and there you have it.Del Toro, who has a fondness for the themes of vampirism and the more unhealthy symbiotic aspects of man's dependence upon his technology and vice-versa, could not have been able to resist the opportunities this script must have presented, and he doesn't miss a trick here. Though the fight scenes could be categorized as 'fantasy violence,' he presents the set-pieces here with all the finesse and style of an EVIL DEAD remake with Jet Li as the star, scored with the sound of depth charges going off. The choreography is as sharp-edged as anything you've seen in THE MATRIX or CROUCHING TIGER, and the gore as prevalent and pustulent as a book of H.R. Giger's unused ideas for ALIEN or SPECIES.  The makeup and visuals departments get to have a field day, especially with some biological traits displayed by the mutant vampires, that will have you wishing you'd skipped dinner before the movie.One of the most outstanding special effects on display, however, isn't even a prop or a visual. Del Toro and other directors of his caliber, (like Jean-Pierre Jeunet) all share a fondness for using one incredible actor: Ron Perlman. The former BEAUTY AND THE BEAST-star has one of the most recognizable anti-leading man mugs in cinematic history; he makes Kristofferson look like the next GQ cover by comparison. And Perlman is nearly peerless in his fearless dedication to a full exploration of how the most unsavory of characters is motivated, (with strong runners-up being the likes of Nicholson, Walken, Hopper and Woods).Which is how he nearly walks away with the movie as Reinhardt, the leader of the elite 'Bloodpack' charged to help Blade hunt down the mutant vamps' leader (as opposed to their original mission, which was to hunt down and kill Blade.) A vampire with a fascist outlook and bloodsucker-supremacist leanings? What a truly sick, original idea. And what a magnificent opportunity for an actor of Perlman's gifts to pull it off. Only someone with Snipes daunting ability for manifesting his physical presence on-screen, could even hope not to be overshadowed, and their physical and verbal sparring matches make you wish that del Toro had made room for more such moments throughout the movie.Thomas Kretschmann and Luke Goss are impressive as the main antagonists of the piece, and Leonor Varela as the comely non-mutant vamp Nyssa kicks butt with the best of the guys, but is given little to do otherwise, especially in a painfully underdeveloped romantic subplot involving Blade, which rings really false later in the finale, shot as beautifully as a Calvin Klein commercial directed by Anne Rice, and carrying about as much emotional weight.If an all-out mega-assault on your senses is what you're looking for, BLADE is more than happy to oblige. But unlike similarly CGI-rich gorefests like RESIDENT EVIL, this one has one badass Daywalker to keep it (and the audience) riveted and reasonably centered amidst the chaotic designer mayhem.And besides, where else can you hear an actor tackle a line like 'You want us to spray ourselves with some suckpuppy's nut-juice?' with a totally straight face, and make it believable, even as you chortle at the purple outlandishness of the dialogue?",Null,0,3,6 May 2002
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," At Last - The Razor Swings Wide...And So Does The Musical!
","First of all, a note to the 'Sweeney' purists among us, of which I thought I was one. A movie is NOT a Broadway musical and vice versa, so if you are coming to Tim Burton's rendering of SWEENEY TODD expecting to see a slavish recreation of the live theater version, go buy the DVD of the George Hearn/Angela Lansbury revival from the Eighties and stick to it. You'll be much happier than you will be with this version.Having said that, now let us 'attend the tale.' I came away from seeing this a lot happier than I thought I would, and here's why: no one else could have or should have done this film except for Tim Burton. With his proclivity for all things Gothic and macabre, the material is a perfect fit, and he doesn't waste one iota of the opportunity. I can already see that this has a firm lock on many technical Oscar awards, because everything from Dante Ferretti's production design to Colleen Atwood's costumes are darkly scrumptious. The grit, grime and grue of Victorian Era London only hinted at in musical pieces like OLIVER! (and barely mentioned in MARY POPPINS) gets the 'full monty' here. These are the same streets that would also give birth to Jack The Ripper...Employing the talents of musical director/conductor Paul Gemignani and arranger Jonathan Tunick from the original show is probably the second best move from Burton and the producers, because the orchestrations are as lush to the ears as the visuals are to the eyes. Another musical may be made that looks and sounds this good translated to the screen, but it won't be this year, and probably not in the next one, either.Now for the songs: at least a good third of the tunes are missing, and many will lament the absence of 'The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd', although the theme is played over the stunning main title sequence. All of the ensemble pieces have been excised and many of the core songs have been shortened, but it's all for a very good, logical reason. These tunes set the stage, the tone and drive the narrative, drawing the kind of pictures the audience in live theater would need to be transported to this time and place with these characters. With movie-making this meticulously good, this is unnecessary. You can almost smell the mud and slime on the cobblestones, hear the racket coming from the many pubs and peer into the dark back alleyways...the time and place are more than firmly established. Unlike the stage version, it's all about the characters and here we get to know them more intimately than ever before. The vocal performances don't need to be as bombastic as they are in previous versions...When you're dealing with a ten-foot wide screen, there's no need to project back into the 'cheap seats.' So, with that in mind, who comes off best and who doesn't?Johnny Depp, as would be expected, leads the way as Sweeney. He sings in a register much higher than the part calls for, but he acts the living hell out of the part, so this is a minor quibble. His is a Sweeney who wears the ravages of injustice and betrayal like an overcoat, one that is only discarded once his 'friends' are finally in his hands. He's said that he will never do a singing role again. More's the pity, but even if he doesn't, he can consider this turn as one of the best of his career, if not THE best.Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett is good enough to hold up in this production, but it seems as if all the loopy, twisted, sanguine JOY has been sucked out of the role. Mrs. Lovett is the love-starved, amoral and more-than-slightly bent comic relief, and it's a pity that Carter couldn't access that more. I was much more concerned with that than her singing ability or lack thereof.Sacha Baron Cohen knew EXACTLY what to do with Adolfo Pirelli, and hits his comical and sinister turn dead on. If everything else about this movie had been dreadful, he would've made it all worth it just by himself.Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall are my new heroes. Spall is every bit as foppishly, fawningly nasty as Beadle Bamford should be. And I expected no less than perfection in villainy from Rickman, who's re-written the book on it in the past two or three decades. But SINGING? I wasn't expecting that, and what a wonderful surprise it was. Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener as Anthony and Johanna, respectively, are refreshingly winsome in their roles - innocents just trying not to get devoured by darkness. It's a pity that most of their meatier numbers are cut, but here it makes sense. They are nothing more than convenient cogs in Sweeney's malevolent machine of vengeance, and as such are required to do little more than serve their purpose. One of the main performers that will have tongues wagging is Ed Sanders as Tobias Ragg. A stunning combination of both Mark Lester's and Jack Wild's characters in the movie version of OLIVER!, he is age-appropriate, but hardened, seasoned and wise beyond his years, like many of the real children described in the writings of Dickens, and the unfiltered account of Oliver Twist softened by the Broadway version. His delivery of 'Not While I'm Around' may be one of the most poignant yet, and the dramatic arc of his character feels exactly right up to the shocking, bitter end.I hereby pronounce multiple viewings of SWEENEY TODD as essential, if only for myself, because I know there's a lot I missed the first time, as I'm sure Tim Burton planned. And I won't mind uncovering even more of the details and dark pleasures of this bracing reinterpretation of Sondheim's career-defining work.",9,5,10,23 December 2007
The Godfather: Part II," Does It Get Any Better Than This? FUGGEDDABOUDIT!!!
","You could make a list that would reach Saturn and back, of all the films you could watch, that serve as on-screen primers on how NOT to make a movie. The list of those films that are the perfect examples of HOW to do it is lamentably shorter; those that instruct how to make a perfect sequel even more brief. At the top of that particular list stands THE GODFATHER, PART II. People are often quick and harsh in their assessment of all the things that were wrong with the third sequel, and they are especially hard on Sofia Coppola. But even if she had turned in an Oscar-worthy performance, think about it...did Francis have a snowball's chance in hell of topping the Perfect Sequel?First of all, we get a two-fer: not only do we get the magnificent performance from Al Pacino as Michael, the reluctant new Don Corleone, who has come full circle and has assumed the very mantle he had always hoped to avoid, as well as everything that goes with it, but we get Robert De Niro's breakout portrayal as young Vito in the old country. We get to see how the Family got started, and that the spiritual, moral and financial dilemmas that father and son had to face, spanning nearly a century, were not as different as either one of them might have thought. The continuation of a story that deepens the situations and our insight into the characters; Gordon Willis' peerless photography; Dean Tavoularis' amazing sets and Theodora Van Runkle's costumes; the Nino Rota/Carmine Coppola themes that are so familiar to us now that they're almost subliminal, and that note-perfect casting of all the supporting players, even the appearance of some faces you may have forgotten were associated with the series, especially people like THE SOPRANO'S Dominic Chianese and CITY SLICKERS' Bruno Kirby. Part Three never stood a chance.",Null,0,0,11 February 2001
28 Weeks Later," Home Is Where The HELL Is...
","When approaching sequels, especially in these dark, writers' strike-filled times, I always feel a sense of nausea, fear and intense loathing. And I'm sure I'm not alone in this...especially after some horrendous cinematic turds like the AVP sequel, (the last one, not the most recent) which looked awesome and played like it had been rewritten by that mentally crippled kid on THE SIMPSONS. Well, I got the same feeling with 28 WEEKS LATER, only more so, because Danny Boyle in his wonderfully insidious way, had taken the 'zombie' genre and stood it on its head, literally, giving us a harrowing, horrifying and downright traumatizing experience not soon to be forgotten. How in the hell is some director you've never heard of with a virtually no-name cast going to hope to equal THAT?Well, as it turned out, director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (ENTACTO) did one hell of a job, putting his own stamp on an ever-deepening, nightmarish glimpse into a man-made Hell that has no foreseeable exits - no happy endings around the corner here! And in his own, sneaky way, working with co-writers Rowan Joffe, Jesus Olmo and Enrique Lopez Lavigne, Fresnadillo trumps Boyle's insidious gambit by adding just a little something extra...presenting this next chapter in the series in the context of a domestic family/survival drama. It is exactly 28 weeks after the mind-numbing events of 28 DAYS. London is a ghost town. The last of the infected victims of the rage virus have finally died, most probably from starvation. And working in tandem with the Brits, here we come, the big, bad Yanks to save the day and help clean up and repopulate the eerily quiet streets with Londoners who are anxious to get back to lives that are as normal as possible, under the circumstances. One of those people is Don (the always-dependable Robert 'RAVENOUS' Carlyle), who can't wait to be reunited with his kids, daughter Tammy (Imogen Poots) and young son Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), both of whom were going to school abroad in the U.S. when everything across the pond went 'tits up', and who have been living as refugees since before the 'repopulation' effort began. Their reunion is a happy one, but not without a few dark spots. One of them being that their mother, Alice (Catherine McCormack) is not there with Don, having fallen victim to 'the infected' during a horrifying attack that opens up the movie. Alas, but there's much more to the tragic story than that, and what it is, I'm not at liberty to say. Just know that the movie's main plot hangs on what this family has been through, and their story is a real knee-slapper...especially since it serves as the catalyst to reopen 'Pandora's box,' in a manner of speaking. So I'll just shut the hell up now, except to add that the only thing more shocking than the twists this movie takes is the ultra-bleak ending, somewhat hinted at in the first movie.Fresnadillo cannily doesn't try to reinvent the remarkably rancid recipe that Boyle established in DAYS, which is a good thing. Mixing virtually unknown actors with vaguely recognizable faces (like Cillian Murphy and Brendan Gleeson in DAYS, and Carlyle, Harold Perrineau and Idris Elba here) lends the sequel that same spooky air of 'you-are-there' realism, and he relies more heavily than Boyle did on a very documentary-like look and feel, relying cleverly on several types of visual media that are natural to the story, as well as aiding in driving it forward, (a terrifying sequence in a subway station will stay with you for days.)The acting, as always, is top-notch, and Carlyle shows again why he seems so much more at home in genre movies than in 'veddy, veddy serious' British dramas or indie comedies, (although he's most well known for THE FULL MONTY.)Technically, what's always made the '28' series a little more disturbing than your average zombie munch-fest is that the monsters in this series are people infected by a virus and not 'really' zombies, which removes that layer of 'fantasy detachment' that comes ready-made with other horror movies. What happens here is a little more feasible and therefore much more unsettling, so you may want to skip this one if you are easily nightmare-prone. It's unfortunate that Fox Atomic has put plans for 28 YEARS LATER on the back burner, based on the recent non-performance of some other major horror releases, (most of which SUCKED armadillo ass to begin with, but I guess the suits in the front office missed THAT memo.)In any case, cuddle up on the couch with your loved one for 28 WEEKS LATER in the meantime, and make sure you keep your carbine loaded and at the ready. You know - just in case...",9,3,4,5 December 2008
The Village," It Takes THE VILLAGE To Tell A Story...
","If you think you're going to get me to tell you what the 'twist' is in M. Night Shyamalan's latest enigma wrapped inside a mystery folded into a conundrum, forget it. In fact, there's not just one twist, but several smaller ones and one REALLY BIG one. The problem most moviegoers and critics are having is that it's an old-fashioned twist, one that most writers and directors don't believe in using anymore. Except for once in a very great while. THE USUAL SUSPECTS had that kind of twist. As did MALICE. But then THE SIXTH SENSE found a new and exciting way to do it, and there's the rub. Now we expect 'Night' to deliver something that spectacular with every movie he makes. Which was about like asking Orson Welles to top CITIZEN KANE every time he stepped behind a camera.What was important to me is how his artistry at filmmaking is holding up, and if THE VILLAGE is proof, then he's still every bit as good at storytelling as Spielberg, if not a tad better. The photography, music and (most of the) set design couldn't have been better, and those performances...!!!Keep your eye on Bryce Dallas Howard after this. Ron's little girl has a big career ahead of her, showing that Night still has an uncanny eye for new talent. And William Hurt? He and Sigourney Weaver haven't been in a movie together since 'Eyewitness,' and if anything, they make up for whatever shortcomings that experience had with their chemistry in this one.Every single person kicked it up a notch, especially Joaquin, who is one of the most vulnerable yet masculine hunks to come along in a while as Lucius Hunt. But with all that said, and all the praise doled out, the big, standout performance you may be talking about belongs to one actor...Adrien Brody. The part seems so small at first, it makes you wonder why he would do this to follow up his spectacular work in THE PIANIST.
You will understand soon enough, when you realize that it's not the size of the role, but what Adrien does with it, that counts. And even he can't upstage the real star of THE VILLAGE...the Pennsylvania woods themselves. There is more dread and ominous creepiness in one shot of the woods surrounding The Village, than in the first thirty minutes of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. (They only WISH BWP had been this frightening.)So without giving away a single detail, what can I tell you about how you'll like or hate this movie? Let me put it this way...don't go back and watch SIGNS or THE SIXTH SENSE or even UNBREAKABLE before seeing this.Instead, go rent the original PLANET OF THE APES, and watch the whole thing, all the way to the ending we all know by now like the insides of our eyelids. If you are still knocked out by it, you will probably love THE VILLAGE. If you think it's the dumbest thing you've ever seen now, you may want to go see SPIDERMAN 2 or SHREK 2 instead",Null,0,0,31 July 2004
Pitch Black," 'We Don't Need Another Hero?' - Don't Worry...He's Not One...
","People who thought that THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed up EVENT HORIZON, probably didn't see the movie that spawned Vin Diesel's skin-headed killer to begin with, and probably have no intention of doing so. Too bad, because PITCH BLACK actually does kick major ass.Directed by genre vet David Twohy, (WARLOCK and the excellent but underrated BELOW) and written by siblings Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK begins with an 'ALIEN'-esque prologue. When a combination cargo freighter/passenger ship is badly damaged by a freak meteor shower (in which the captain is also killed), the co-pilot, Carolyn Fry (SILENT HILL'S Radha Mitchell) has an important decision to make: ditch the cargo or the passengers? Close to picking ore over occupants, the crash landing derails her ultimate course of action.No matter, because the catastrophic landing has been made on a foreboding rock that once held a mining colony. Amongst the survivors are a couple of settlers, Shazza (FARSCAPE's Claudia Black) and Zeke (John Moore); an Imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say 'red shirts' boys and girls?); an antiques dealer named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); a 'young boy' named Jack (Rhianna Griffith), and the most controversial members of the group: a Marshall named Johns (the excellently slimy Cole Hauser) and his prisoner...a dangerous murderer named Riddick (Diesel). How the group dynamics shake out make for a lot of the dramatic tension, especially with concerns about Riddick and how many people he might slice and dice if he ever gets away. But no one here gets out alive, as the saying goes, and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get along, than how they'll survive when they discover the unthinkable. They are not alone on the planetoid. Things that are hungry, taloned and quick are slithering around just where they can't be seen, living in the darkness where they can survive and thrive. They want the flesh of the new arrivals to sate their appetites, but they can't come out into the searing daylight to forage for food.Does the phrase 'total eclipse' make things a little more interesting? You betcha. Hence the more-than-fitting title.Vin, more monosyllabic than Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry on his grumpiest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day here with a character that really does seem worth a sequel or two, and Hauser, oozing menace and bile is every bit as good as his dad Wings was at on-screen villainy. Surprisingly, though, Mitchell holds her own and manages to be strong and sympathetic as Fry. You would expect no less than a strong showing from Black, She Who Once Was 'Aeryn Sun', and she doesn't disappoint. (Too bad her role wasn't bigger, but that's all I'll say about it.) And David makes his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith will truly be tested in the very pit of Hell itself.The pace moves faster than Riddick slipping up behind his prey with a shank in his teeth, and once the darkness descends, the terror and tension never let up, pretty much as in other classic sci-fi/horror flicks which this imitates. But if imitation truly is the sincerest form of flattery, Dave Twohy and the Wheats deserve major backslaps for getting this one right with a vengeance, and for giving us an ending that is anti-Hollywood to the max.I don't want to spoil the surprises, so I won't say much more, except that if you saw CHRONICLES first and weren't too happy, give PITCH BLACK a chance anyway. And if you've seen neither, definitely start with this one. I don't know what Vin is up to now, but he could certainly do worse than to give these guys a call again. I'd love to see what they would dream up next...",9,3,4,5 December 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," This Is Your Remake On STEROIDS!!!
","French horror film tyro Alexandre Aja and his production partner Gregory Levasseur just missed giving us a modern-day nightmarish classic by THIS much, with 2003's all-out assault on the senses, HIGH TENSION. It made a great calling card for the duo, combining the balls-to-the-wall sensibility of Seventies grindhouse cinema with a post-modern vibe tinged with the angst and anxiety of a world that seems to be getting a little more out of control every day. From the first twenty minutes of that film, I knew I would be a devoted fan of these new, daring filmmakers.But then they tacked on an ending that would've made me reach for an air sickness bag if theaters stocked them, because it seemed to be so jarringly, unexpectedly implausible, misogynistic and just plain STUPID. I sincerely believed that they could never redeem themselves as far as I was concerned.Fast-forward to three years later, after horror legend Wes Craven handpicked Aja and Levasseur to redo his early drive-in favorite, THE HILLS HAVE EYES. By this time, I was absolutely an anti-fan of remakes of any kind. As a rule, most Hollywood remakes and 'reimaginings' of classic films have now managed to live down to the lowest of my expectations. Unlike some really well-done examples from back in the Eighties - Cronenberg's THE FLY, Abel Ferarra's BODY SNATCHERS and Chuck Russell's THE BLOB just to name a few - remakes now seemed to be a miserable excuse for some bloated Hollywood suit to command that a beautifully crafted original be stuffed into an effects-laden, badly scripted and acted, PG-13 rated pale imitation of its former self, just to make some ready cash off its ravaged carcass. I had no hopes at all that this incarnation of THHE would be any different. None. Even though the preview trailers were well-done, it seems that anybody can make fantastic trailers for craptastic films. And with Aja and Levasseur as creators of this new version, I figured that just like with HIGH TENSION, the croissants would surely hit the fan like before.Happily, for the most part, I'm glad to say I was wrong. Classic fright film purists who would 'fart in this movie's general direction' should give it the benefit of the doubt first. The new script not only remains basically faithful to the original premise, but the manner in which the original film established a reputation for being the second most brutal film Craven ever made for its decade, still holds true with this version for our own times.Every aspect of the original story is amped up, with a few scary pluses added. Where the former THHE presented a mutant clan that lived in the desert hills with very little explanation for how they got there, Aja and Levasseur plays upon the deepest musings of your most morbid outdoor fantasies with a 'what-if' scenario that adds government-sanctioned nuclear testing and the usual bureaucratic screwing-up and screwing-over the 'little guys' to give the marginal plausibility a little goosebump-y kick. If you've ever stood in the desert during an off-road trip and gazed at the forbidding hills, wondering what in the hell might be out there besides coyotes and scorpions, this movie provides a gut-churning possible answer.The best advisory I can provide regarding the violence is that those without 'hard-R'-rated constitutions should stay far, far away. The effects work and action sequences here make Craven's original seem almost quaint. And the acting here is more than adequate from the ensemble cast, even if some of the character arcs in the script become a little less than convincing. I just want to say in closing that I have gained a new respect for director Aja's talents. I still haven't found it in myself to bestow full trust in him after the HIGH TENSION debacle, but the new THHE is certainly a big step in the right direction; not only for him, but for millennial remakes in general.",8,3,6,7 May 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," One Of The Best Movie 'Gifts' I've Gotten This Year...
","It is very rare to see a movie that can charm the hell out of an audience without the use of special effects, worn-out clichés and bombastic action set pieces these days. It's even more ridiculous to hope that you will see such a film for FREE. But that's exactly what happened to me tonight at a sneak preview of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.I 'discovered' this movie right here at IMDb, having heard not a peep about it beforehand. By the time I finished watching the second trailer for the THIRD time, I was floored...and hooked. Luckily, the Bulletin Boards steered me toward the proper link to access sneak passes for tonight's showing, and all I can say is that it will not pain me one bit to pay for the privilege of seeing this gem a second time.Assembling the best and most unlikeliest of ensemble casts you may probably see all year, SUNSHINE on the face of it is a relatively (pun intended) simple story. Little seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) has one wish in life: to be considered for the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant in Redondo Beach, CA. When her big chance comes at the most unexpected time, it's up to her unbelievably fractured family to pull themselves together and make it happen for her, no matter what it takes.And what it takes is a sad, painful, tragic and yet unendingly hilarious trek in a barely operational VW bus from Albequerque, NM to the Pageant. And although getting there is only half the fun and family drama, you have got to see what happens to believe it when they finally arrive and Olive gets to 'do her thing.' The strong cast sounds not a single false note, and when the more touching moments arrive, they don't seem forced the way they would in most other big-budget behemoths, because these moments are truly earned. But WHAT a collection of characters this is. Greg Kinnear is letter-perfect as Olive's judgmental, failed motivational-speaker father; Steve Carell finds new shades of darkest despair and human comedy as her suicidal gay uncle, a leading Proust scholar; Paul Dano does amazing things with little more than facial expressions as Olive's older brother who's deep into Nietzche and a vow of absolute silence, and Alan Arkin, though he has played this kind of role with both hands tied behind his back and his eyes closed, still shines like a crazy diamond as her cantankerous and hedonistic grandfather.And barely holding this motley crew together is Toni Collette, who amazes by playing a mother again and yet manages not to portray the role exactly the same way, (you might recall her Oscar-nominated turn as Haley Joel Osment's put-upon mom in THE SIXTH SENSE.) I'm not at all familiar with the work of the two directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, or the writer, Michael Arndt, but they have definitely raised the indie film bar with this effort. Not a single moment is wasted; not a single scene is in this film without having a reason for being there, and it's all character-driven. There's also nothing fluffy about it - commentary about everything from how twisted our pop culture can be, to how our drive for being #1 winners can blind us to all of the things that are the most important are all there under the bittersweet laughs and tears for the audience to discover.I can't recommend this one highly enough. And I can't wait to see it again.",9,385,514,26 July 2006
Wanted," Preposterously Entertaining...
","Try as hard as I might, there was just no way I could get through the movie that was Timur Bekmambetov's intro to the U.S. and to sci-fi/fantasy fans everywhere, NIGHT WATCH. It had nothing to do with the subtitles - I'm rather used to those by now. The trailer for the movie looked amazing, so when I finally got to it and saw how over-the-top all the effects work was, for some reason I found it to be a turn-off. Therefore I did just that...turned the movie off. I had no preconceived ideas about WANTED when it was first released, because I didn't have the advantage (or disadvantage, maybe?) of having read the Mark Millar graphic novel. All I knew from the previews is that Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman were in it, and because it looked so much like a 'MATRIX' rip-off, it was a definite 'wait for the DVD' selection in my book. So I waited and finally rented it. Once the end credits rolled and I discovered that Bekmambetov was the director, it really didn't surprise me. What did bowl me over is that not only did his style fit this story, but that WANTED is one of the most preposterously entertaining movies I watched through all of 2008. Yes, it definitely resembled THE MATRIX more than just a little, but unlike that densely layered trilogy, it cheerfully and stubbornly refused to take on the earnest dead-seriousness of the Wachowski Brothers' cyberpunked-out mythology. And was all the better for not doing so.I guess it's no secret by now that contrary to how it was presented in the oft-seen trailers, the hotter-than-Mount-Pinatubo-lava Angelina Jolie does NOT have the starring role here, though her character is pivotal to the wild plot line. That actually falls to James McAvoy (THE LAST KING OF Scotland, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA) who tries on an American accent (which works for the most part) to play dumped on ne'er-do-well Wesley Gibson. A man so mired in his own inability to care about his life or anything in it, he even buys the condoms his best friend is using to bang his girlfriend with. The self-loathing/self-pity/masochist angle is familiar to us all, but gets poured on so thickly after the slam-bang opening of the first act, that we know that something incredible has to be coming down the pike to shake Wesley from his debilitating sense of ennui. That appears in the delectably dangerous form of Fox (Jolie), a super-assassin who in short order not only tells the nebbishy office drone that his own estranged father is also a pro-killer of the highest order, but that the man who did him in at the movie's opening is out to eliminate Wesley as well...leading to the movie's first and most breathtaking chase sequence. If you've seen THE MATRIX, you know how to spell it out from here. The estimable Morgan Freeman stands in here for Laurence Fishburne, THE MATRIX itself makes an appearance here in the form of the 'looms of fate' as tended by the organization of clandestine killers known as both 'The Weavers' and 'The Fraternity', and 'bullet time' gets a whole new reimagining as weapons and ammo bend and twist in ways that conventional firepower is not meant to. And of course, once Wesley descends far enough into this particular 'rabbit hole', nothing is even close to what it initially appeared to be when he finally emerges from the other end. I've read other reviews where viewers really took this movie to task for not adhering to the original Millar concept and characters. Since I have no previous knowledge of any of that, I can only go by the impression this movie left on me, and I can tell you that I was completely entertained, which is really all I was hoping for at the time. Well-done visual effects, great performances by the cast (and one line delivered by Freeman that probably brought the house down in the theaters where it played). Plus a fittingly cool and pulse-pounding soundtrack by Danny Elfman. Admittedly, WANTED was tailor-made to appeal to 13-year-old gamers and fanboys, and the 13-year-old in me definitely approved.",8,4,6,2 January 2009
Dreamgirls," Another 'Star Is Born'...
","In the history of outstanding movie musicals, any singer/actress worth her talent has had 'that moment.' I certainly don't need to tell you what it is; you know the moment well, because each and every actress who has seized it and made something out of it has been nominated for an Academy Award for just about bringing the house down.Liza Minelli singing 'Maybe This Time' from CABARET.Barbara Streisand singing 'Watch Closely Now' in A STAR IS BORN.Bette Midler pouring out her heart and soul with 'Stay With Me' from THE ROSE.In the chronicles of great performances, each woman has left an indelible mark.And now, Jennifer Hudson joins them.At the very least, this amazing performer is owed a nomination for what she does with the coveted role of Effie White in DREAMGIRLS. And right behind her is another dynamic portrayal that will shock and surprise a lot of people: Eddie Murphy as James 'Thunder' Early. Nowhere in the catalog of his past performances is there any indication that he was capable of something with this much depth and complexity. Whenever Jennifer and Eddie aren't on-screen, you can definitely feel the difference.And that's not to say that everyone else doesn't do a bang-up job in their roles. It's just that both standouts are so amazing that they leave their co-stars in a cloud of stardust. Jamie Foxx is good, but nowhere near as dastardly as he should've been as Curtis Taylor Jr., the 'villain' of the piece. Danny Glover is fine as Marty, and Keith Robinson shines as C.C., Effie's songwriting brother, especially in one of the show's most poignant numbers, 'Family.' Anika Noni Rose and Sharon Leal don't disappoint as Lorell and Michele, the third member of the group and the singer who eventually replaces Effie respectively.And then, there's Beyonce. DREAMGIRLS was supposed to be her vehicle, and in the role that closely follows the career of a certain Ms. Ross, you couldn't want for a better actress. Though she's been pretty much content to play slightly altered versions of her own star persona in previous roles, she understood what it takes to play Deena and she is radiant in what has to be the best performance she has ever given on film, particularly with 'Listen', a number written specifically for the movie.Technically, in every department, everybody gets it right. Production and costume design, musical arranging, photography...this is a movie that will be scooping up some major awards and nominations.And as admirably as every single cast member performed in this remarkable film, it still has to be said...sooner or later, they will all have their time to shine.But right now...this is Eddie's time to come back strong.And Jennifer's moment to take her rightful place in the pantheon of the stars who came before her.The former contestant of 'American Idol' now truly IS one.",9,2,6,25 December 2006
Being John Malkovich," Giving 'head' to the Cult of Celebrity...
","Somewhere, Andy Warhol is laughing and nodding approvingly.If anybody finally 'got' his prediction of 'everyone being famous for fifteen minutes,' it was director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman, who used that conceit to whip up their freshman cinematic effort, which is the oddest, most uniquely unclassifiable original piece of filmmaking to come along in YEARS.The meaning of 'geek' finds a whole new level in John Cusack's portrayal of the hapless puppeteer Craig Schwartz, who gets punched out for presenting deeply cerebral and blatantly sexual public showcases, such as his take on the doomed affair of Abelard and Heloise. Tired of being lambasted, and in this particular case, lacerated, he finally relents to join the rat race at the urging of his kindly, Animal Planet-minded missus, Lotte, (Cameron Diaz in a death-defyingly unglamorous role.)The dexterity that helps him with his puppets lands him a job at the Mertin-Flemmer building on the 7 1/2 Floor, (don't ask, just take my word for it: you have to see it to believe it, as well as the hysterically funny pseudo-orientation film that explains it.) It is here at this new gig that Craig experiences several life-changing events.One, he meets his centegenerean lech of a boss, played with smarmy aplomb by Orson Bean, and his object of desire, a ditzy executive secretary played by the always awesome Mary Kay Place. Two, he finds his own sexual obsession in Maxine, a fabulous Frigidaire of a female coworker, rendered with well-pitched perfection by indie fave Catherine Keener, who has turned playing brusque,  brittle characters into an art form.But here's where it all gets REALLY strange: Craig discovers a portal behind some filing cabinets in the office, behind a tiny locked door, which for all the world looks like a passage into Wonderland. But where it leads is even more wonderful and bizarre....For fifteen minutes, you get to live inside the head of actor John Malkovich. Seeing, feeling, and thinking everything that he does. Then when time's up, you find yourself expelled on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.Where the hell is the logic in that? Who gives a rat's ass? Not Craig, once he's experienced the rush of living inside someone else's skin, especially a big celebrity. Certainly not Maxine, who automatically seizes on the more practical implications of Craig's amazing discovery. Not Lotte, whose journey into Johnnyland causes her to reevaluate her own sense of identity, sexual and otherwise.And certainly not you, dear viewer, who will be so busy wrestling with what this incredible film has to say about unfulfilled promise, unrealized dreams, the unending quest to escape oneself by living vicariously through others, when you're not laughing yourself silly, or marveling at the sheer inventiveness of the cast and crew, that all you'll be thinking about is hitting the 'play' button to see it over again.This is one of those rare films that demands repeat viewings, during which you'll find a slew of favorite, freeze-frameable moments. My own personal highlight: when a befuddled, bewitched, bothered and bewildered John Malkovich, playing a skewed Doppelganger of himself, goes through his own portal. You'll never look at 'self-centeredness' the same way again.Quirky, spellbinding, surprising, sad, pensive...you could run out of superlatives praising BJM, but as you can see, if somebody asks you what it's about, it completely defies a one-line description.Just tell 'em what I did: 'Rent it. Then come back and we'll talk.'You'll both have plenty to say, believe me. This movie sure does. And for once, I can truly say that this picture was robbed by being passed over for a Best Picture Oscar, and sincerely mean it.",Null,0,1,15 December 2000
Aliens," 'Ripley's-Believe-It-Or-Not-She's-Going-WHERE???'
","In any movie genre, you can practically count the instances on one hand where any sequel in a film series is either as good as, or surpasses the original. (GODFATHER TWO is the most- often used example).ALIENS had no business being even as good as the Ridley Scott original, but thanks to James Cameron's penchant for militaristic fetishism and his knack for drawing sharp characters in harrowing situations, it manages in a lot of ways to best its predecessor. It picks up right where the last one ended: Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is rescued as the sole survivor of the destruction of the freighter ship Nostromo. Unfortunately, she discovers that sole survivors make great scapegoats, so she is blamed for the ship explosion AND the deaths of the crew, and decommissioned. Oh, but the fun has just started for Ripley. A little while after her disgraceful discharge, she gets a visit from an officer in the Colonial Marines. Seems that a group of colonists has disappeared, and would she be interested in helping re-locate them? More shocking than the fact that the-powers-that-be would ask her is the reason why they did: the totally clueless colonists decided to put down roots ON THE VERY SAME PLANETOID where the Nostromo crew checked out that 'distress signal' which got the whole mess started in the first place!To say she's reluctant to go back is putting it mildly, but not one to turn down a chance at clearing her name (not to mention getting in some payback), Ripley is 'imbedded' with a bunch of battle-hardened, gung-ho Colonial Marine grunts who have no idea about the royal smackdown they're in for at the hands of the Aliens. The motley crew includes the irritatingly bitchy Pvt. Hudson (a scene-stealing Bill Paxton); Privates Drake (Mark Rolston) and ultra-butch Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) who are probably more than just 'comrades- at-arms'; Cpl. Dwayne Hicks (Michael Biehn) who shares a few brief romantic sparks with Ripley, and android helper Bishop (Lance Henriksen) with whom Ripley wants absolutely nothing to do with initially, the ordeal with Ash from Part One still raw and fresh in her mind.Oh, and did I mention 'Company' man and civilian rep Carter Burke? As played by Paul Reiser, it's the most hissable performance in the movie (almost more so than the Aliens'), and it rocketed his status from a guest-starring stand-up comedian to a bonafied actor. All the Cameron trademarks are here: strong and flawed male characters, stronger and even more resilient female characters, cool weapons, intense battle sequences, tension and suspense by the boatload. And a new ingredient that elevates this sequel immediately: motherhood. Ripley, for whom self-preservation is like breathing, discovers the 'mommy- track' when she bonds with the only survivor of the ravaged colony, a young girl named Newt (Carrie Henn), for whom Ripley suddenly realizes she'll take on anything to protect.Good thing, too. Because as she discovers in one of the most classic sequences in sci- fi/horror history, even Aliens have mothers, too. Or in this case, one Queen Bitch of a Mother!ALIEN still is an all-time classic without a doubt. But not having the sequel right along side it is like having a bag of Chips Ahoys...with no 'chips'!",10,1,2,4 December 2008
Enchanted," Disney Does The Unexpected...
","It is VERY, very seldom that I go out of my way to watch a PG-rated movie, let alone a Disney film, unless it happens to be one of the classics I grew up with, or it presents something completely fresh, new and unexpected. NOT three words I would usually associate with something from Disney these days, but now I stand forcefully corrected. Not only has Disney taken that time-honored, road-tested (and considerably worn-out) concept of 'Happily Ever After' and completely subverted it, but they've done it in a way that's shocking, surprising and incredibly entertaining!ENCHANTED is, I promise you, like nothing you have ever seen from 'the Mouse House' before! Taking everything we've known about fairy-tale scenarios about princesses, handsome princes, evil stepmothers and 'true love's kiss', it presents it all in a bright, shiny, delicate, bejeweled package with which everyone is more than a little familiar...then drops it off the Empire State Building!Part-animation, part live-action and CG, and definitely part old-time musical, it's the wonderful story of Giselle, a fair maiden longing for her handsome prince, Edward, and the wonderful state of 'happily ever after' bliss in which they'll live once they meet, fall into each other's arms and are immediately married.You know what's coming next. Edward's mother, The Wicked Queen, isn't about to let some little 'forest rat' take over her throne, so in a disguise that will be more than a little recognizable, she tricks Giselle on her wedding day and with one of those evil magic spells that every witch keeps handy, she sends the poor girl spinning into a place she never expected...THE REAL WORLD. But not just any part of it. TIMES SQUARE IN MANHATTAN!I could go on for at least a dozen more paragraphs about how great, brilliant and hysterically FUNNY it is when Fairy Tale Land and the Real World come crashing together, complete with the truly startled kind of reactions you or I would have when faced with a princess, a handsome and slightly dangerous prince and even a 'talking' chipmunk, but I will leave these wonders and the rapture of a tale well-told for you to discover yourself. In the meantime, I have to give crazy props to the performances of all the actors who not only voice the principal characters, but play them in the 'Real World' as well. Amy Adams is nothing short of perfect as Giselle, as she completely enraptures us with the arc of change she goes through, transitioning from fairy-tale princess wanna-be to a real woman with true feelings. James Marsden is hysterical as Edward, and Timothy Spall hits every comedic note just right as Nathaniel, Edward's sidekick and the Queen's lackey.But these stories are only as good as the heroine and her nemesis are in them, and Susan Sarandon has a ball as Evil Incarnate. Channeling every wicked female figure in Disney lore, she owns the screen every time she's on it - in both real and animated form - and it's 50% because of her that ENCHANTED has a thrilling third act. Patrick Dempsey, Idina Menzel and the supporting cast are all great, but this story definitely belongs to the leads. But most of all, dear moviegoer, it belongs to you, because without our suspension of disbelief, who would even care about what happens in the beautiful, 'ENCHANTED' realm of Andalasia or even its not-so-moondust sprinkled counterpart, good old N.Y.C.?Disney never stopped making family movies, but it's good for once to see one truly made for the ENTIRE family - kids and adults alike.",9,1,1,17 January 2009
No Country for Old Men," 'Call It...Friendo...'
","Our post 9/11 world is an increasingly dark and frightening place, and more and more, independent films are reflecting this. And none does a more effective job than NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Although conceptually it is hardly the best or most satisfying of the Coen Brothers films, possibly because it does seem to stay true to the spirit of Cormac McCarthy's bleak worldview, it has some of the best performances the team has ever gotten from actors they've worked with.Just as the title baldly states, the world is becoming a much less accommodating or welcoming place for old time lawmen like Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones in the role that SHOULD'VE won him the Oscar.) There is no clear delineation between good and evil anymore, and evil has gotten more potent and a lot crazier. There is no honor among thieves or those sworn to bring them to justice, and the price of upholding principles could very well be everything...including your life.Even the hardiest (if not the smartest) of young men can only hope to survive. In this case, the young man in question is one Llewelyn Moss (an excellent Josh Brolin.) Moss is out hunting one day when he comes across a scene of unspeakable carnage out in the middle of the desert: a drug deal gone spectacularly wrong. Following a trail of blood and heroin, Moss comes across the one would-be survivor of the massacre, and a case of money that's more than he could hope to put together in three lifetimes. Remember what I said about young men not being too smart? Well, Llewelyn's no rocket scientist, because even though he knows it can only bring him the worst kind of trouble, he takes the satchel anyway. What Moss could've never guessed is exactly what kind of trouble, and how bad it would be. Trouble's name in this case would be Anton Chigurh (a nearly unrecognizable Javier Bardem, in the role that rightfully won him a Best Actor Oscar.) With that frightening Dorothy Hamiil- meets-Dustin-Hoffman-in-THE-GRADUATE pageboy haircut, and that voice that sounds like Mercedes McCambridge practicing lines for THE EXORCIST, he's your worst nightmare...a psychotic hired killer who revels in his psychosis, and regards killing the way we would regard grabbing a two-scoop cone at Ben and Jerry's.One of the most disturbing scenes comes in at the very beginning, when Chigurh murders a deputy who thinks he's got it all under control when he brings this maniac in. The scene is exactly the kind that would have Hitchcock rubbing his hands together with glee. It's shot almost like a sex scene. Don't believe me? Watch closely...then run for the nearest shower afterward.Chigurh's been hired to follow Moss's trail to the money, but the fact that he has his own twisted agenda and crazed sense of principles is what makes him dangerously unpredictable. And it's the trail of corpses he leaves in his wake, using an instrument of death that has to be the most bizarre so far in movie history, (and that's saying something these days), that leads him to cross paths with Sheriff Bell. I don't want to say much more about it, except that another stroke of brilliance the Coens stole from Hitch, is how there is virtually no music whatsoever until the credits roll. You are so engrossed in the story and the characters that you don't really notice...until it kicks in at the very end. And juxtaposing the violence and moments of nearly unbearable tension is the breathtaking job that DP Roger Deakins did on the cinematography. It takes nothing away from the film to note how gorgeous the images are - one standout scene being a chase sequence involving Moss and some of the interested parties who are after him for the money, besides Chigurh. Singing the praises of Jones, Bardem and Brolin, I don't want to shortchange any of the other cast members, since everyone gives phenomenal performances - most of them so good, they don't even seem like acting. Garret Dillahunt as Bell's stalwart deputy; Tess Harper as Bell's wife; Woody Harrelson as a tracker who really underestimates Chigurh's insanity; Kelly MacDonald and Beth Grant as Moss's wife and mother-in-law, respectively and Stephen Root in a role that is a shocking departure from his usual comedic work. They are all unfailingly good. Where most moviegoers will find fault with COUNTRY is the lack of an ending that ties up all the loose ends, finding the bad guys dead, the good guys riding off into the sunset and everybody living happily ever after. Yet once again, considering the times in which we live, would you really have expected a tale so dark to end any other way but the way it does?Not a bouncy, breezy evening at the movies, but unforgettable nevertheless, and I think it will equally please McCarthy and Coen Brothers fans without missing a beat.Oh, and horror fans...Don't be too shocked to find that Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees have been replaced in your dreams by the face and voice of Anton Chigurh. He's so much WORSE.Because Michael, Jason and Freddy are not people who could be parked across the street from your house right now. Anton could be...",9,4,7,13 September 2008
28 Days Later...," Not Your Average 'Zombie' Flick...
","Danny Boyle is a true gem: a director who gives you no idea what he's going to come up with next. Crossing over with an eerie ease from Hitchcockian thriller (SHALLOW GRAVE) to a funny, gritty, nauseatingly disturbing drama about addiction (TRAINSPOTTING), when I heard that he might be doing a 'horror' film, I couldn't wait to see the result. Actually, with the exception of the startling trailer for the movie, which gave surprisingly little away, I thought I was all ready to tackle Boyle's version of zombie culture.As it turns out, I wasn't.I don't remember the last time I gasped and cringed that much at a movie, much less jumped out of my seat, (which I did several times - something that happens VERY rarely these days.) Much in the way that he less channeled Hitchcock in SHALLOW GRAVE than redefined that director's paradigm of what a suspense thriller is, 28 DAYS LATER doesn't really ape the work of George Romero or Lucio Fulci. Rather it re-energizes the genre by giving us something that, technically speaking, really isn't a 'zombie' film more than it is a 'plague' movie. Relocate Stephen King's THE STAND in present-day London, and re-populate it with British characters and you're almost close to the feel of what it is.Written by Alex Garland (author of Boyle's ambitiously flawed THE BEACH), LATER'S opening takes its cues from both the Romero and Roger Corman playbooks. Three wrongheaded militant animal activists break into a science lab with the intention of freeing the animals there from the barbarity of medical experimentation. What they don't realize is that they're not only too late, but they are about to loose something upon the world that was never meant to get out...And then, 28 DAYS LATER -A young patient in hospital named Jim (Cillian Murphy in his first major role) awakens in his hospital bed to find himself alone. Not just in his room, but in the hospital, in the surrounding neighborhood, in the city...maybe even in the country. THE WORLD, perhaps. You are as disoriented, startled and scared as he is, and concerned FOR him as Boyle allows you to practically walk in his shoes for a bit and wonder what you would do in his place.Jim goes looking for other people. And he does find them, as they also find him. But the first ones he sees moving about aren't really people anymore...To say more is to spoil the industrial-strength effect this movie will have on your nerves if you haven't seen it before. All you need to know is that there are two kinds of people in this terrifying new world: the infected and the uninfected. And the line between the two groups is as fragile as a drop of blood...It adds to the sense of heightened realism that the cast (much like famed horror classics like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD) is comprised almost entirely of unknown actors. Murphy was only a few years away from RED EYE and BATMAN BEGINS, and Naomie Harris's breakout role in the 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN' sequel was still in the not-too-distant future. Only HARRY POTTER'S Brendan Gleason is sort of recognizable, and robust as ever as a survivor trying to protect his daughter from the ravages of what has become Hell on Earth.Zombie film or not, whatever you want to classify it as, 28 DAYS LATER is definitely not for the squeamish. Fast, frightening and ferocious, there are scenes of brutality that are not gratuitous by any means, but they're strategically placed at parts of the story when you will least expect them, and they have all the more impact as you come to learn about Jim and his new 'friends', and you start to give a damn about what happens to them.True, as noted in other reviews, the movie does start to lose steam around the middle of Act Three, and the controversial ending may leave some of you feeling unsatisfied. (Don't forget to review the alternative endings on the comprehensive DVD.)But this is still worth more than just a passing glance. It might very well qualify as a present- day classic. And though Boyle has drifted away from horror again for the moment, I can't wait to see what he cooks up when he returns to it...",9,2,3,4 December 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," 'X-Termination' of 'X-cellence?'
","With the assignment of directorial duties to series newcomer Brett Ratner, (RUSH HOUR 1 & 2; Fox TV's PRISON BREAK), much of the heart, humor and wit brought to X-MEN by fanboy-at-heart Bryan Singer is absolutely M.I.A., and the larger themes of discrimination, assimilation and intolerance become almost afterthoughts in service to driving everything and everyone towards the franchise climax: 'The Big Battle.'LAST STAND begins, we can only assume, a few years after the events of X-MEN UNITED transpired, climaxing with the noble death of Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Storm (Halle Berry), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Cyclops (James Marsden) have taken a more active role in the day-to-day administration of Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Children. Well, actually that would be Storm and Wolverine. Cyclops is still too torn up over the death of his beloved Jean to do anybody much good, so gone is the testosterone-fueled banter that sparked the amusing-if-contentious relationship between himself and Wolverine.Magneto (Ian McKellen) is out of sight but most definitely not out of the minds of Our Heroes or the Feds. It would take a major event of seismic proportions to bring Xavier's buddy-turned-nemesis out into the open, and one finally happens: subsidized by the Government, Worthington Labs manages to formulate a 'cure' for the mutants to provide them with the choice to revert back to their human selves, if they wish.Big news, indeed, and it can only be delivered to the School by a big messenger: hulking and hirsute blue-furred Former Secretary of Mutant Affairs Dr. Hank McCoy, a.k.a. Beast (played to the hilt by former FRASIER star Kelsey Gramm er.) The possibilities split the mutant world immediately into two camps: those who see it as a godsend and those who revile it as a veiled form of genetic fascism, bordering on actual genocide. Storm comes down in favor of the latter camp, (and as it has been pointed out a number of times, she IS biased, guilty of not only being one of the hotter mutants, but also of possessing the coolest powers bar none), where mutants like the forlorn Marie, aka Rogue (Anna Paquin), take the former stance. Rogue, after all, would like to have a boyfriend she could actually hug and kiss without worrying about killing him, said boyfriend in this case being Bobby Drake/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore).Meanwhile, as Magneto uses the controversy as a catalyst to reunite his renegade mutant band and to amass an entire army of rogue mutants, some weird psychic vibes that profoundly affect Cyclops compel him to return to Alkali Lake, the scene of the previous movie's climax, where he discovers a revived Jean Grey. Not to give a lot away, but some major stuff goes down, leaving Jean to be discovered by Storm and Logan.Xavier (Patrick Stewart) offers an explanation for Jean's return. To say that she's 'not quite herself' is a gross understatement, as her new persona, 'Dark Phoenix,' makes herself known in some unexpected and frightening ways.So the stage is finally set for a war where it's good mutants vs. bad, which may be irrelevant if the unpredictable powers of the 'new' Jean Grey winds up destroying everything and everyone indiscriminately, be it Man or Mutant.This is probably oversimplifying everything just a tad, but I've done it for two reasons: 1) so that this review can be as spoiler-free as possible, and 2) to mirror the more simplistic approach taken by director-for-hire Ratner.As a result, LAST STAND looks great, has the pre-requisite dazzling special effects sequences, (the Golden Gate bridge sequence is the centerpiece of the whole movie), a magnificent score by John Powell, and all of the bells and whistles provided by whipcrack editing and sharp cinematography. But in serving his own vision of the film, Ratner also short-shrifts his cast for some unique opportunities to shine, and that's a shame.Halle Berry's Storm, who looks better than she has before in the previous two films, really doesn't have that much more to do. In fact, Beast, a 'new kid on the block', gets about as much screen time as she does, and both deserved more. Same with new hero Warren Worthington III, aka Angel (a newly buffed-out Ben Foster of SIX FEET UNDER and HOSTAGE), whose first appearance packs as much visual punch as either Beast or Jean Grey, (not to mention the metaphor of his mutation representing a kind of 'coming out' adds even more of an edge to the themes of discrimination and assimilation), but then he's gone for much of the movie and doesn't reappear until things are almost over.And then there's Jean/Dark Phoenix. Resurrected by who-knows-what, (the anguish of Cyclops? the threat of mutant annihilation?) the psychological baggage she brings with her dangerous and exponentially growing powers make her the most compelling character in this installment, yet the scenes that involve her use (or abuse) of her talents seem cribbed from the best work of Brian De Palma and David Cronenberg, (hawkeyed buffs will recognize lifts from CARRIE, THE FURY and SCANNERS immediately).For those not into analyzing every frame of a summer blockbuster, who are just content to 'go with the flow', this will all seem like fussy nitpicking. And maybe it is. But for my money, I still found myself missing Bryan Singer's signature touches deeply, and regret that he couldn't stick with the franchise that is basically his baby, though the mind reels at the prospect of what he has contributed to the rebirth of the SUPERMAN series.All-in-all, not a bad day at the movies, this. But I'm hoping that whatever is on the boards next, they'll have Bryan back to do a little 'clean-up' work.",8,0,0,4 June 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not Since 'Godfather II'...
","The list of sequels equal to or better than their predecessors has always been a short one, and every true movie buff can recite that list without even blinking. GODFATHER 2. ALIENS. TERMINATOR 2. STAR TREK 2. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, (although this last one has always been controversial.)Now TTT can be added to that list, and I daresay that RETURN OF THE KING will probably follow it. Peter Jackson and his crew have not simply brought the once-considered unfilmable bulk of J.R.R. Tolkien's world from the printed page to the big screen. They have made their mark upon it for all time, as well as changing the face of moviemaking as we know it. Just looking at Gollum, I feel no need to justify this statement. It is simply a fact.Ever since seeing FELLOWSHIP in the theater, then seeing the Extended Version on DVD, we swore we'd never again trust a theatrical version in this series, but simply wait for the DVD/EV release. I'm so glad we did.
Not having read the books all the way through, I can't say what Jackson, Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens kept or what they left out. But what was included, is the magnificent tale of good and evil, love and hatred, greed and sacrifice, the blackest despair and the utmost hope. And not to mention the truest meaning of humanity, displayed in the loyalty and undying friendship between the splintered Fellowship members, especially Frodo and Sam.If nothing else at all about this film impresses you, simply sit back and marvel at the wonder of Andrew Lesnie's panoramic vistas. Lean, Kubrick, Ford, Kurosawa....they would all applaud what he, Peter Jackson and company have done to take the most breathtaking aspects of New Zealand, and transform them into Middle Earth.And as consistently marvelous as all of the actors are, both old and new to the series, Andy Serkis must be singled out, for giving his all to a character that would never allow his face to be seen on camera. But without his performance, Gollum could never be as staggeringly real as he is, and without Gollum, the entire enterprise would be practically worthless. CGI character or not, once again the Academy stumbled and fell by failing to recognize one of the most spellbinding achievements in cinematic history.TTT/EV runs at nearly four hours, and it's worth every minute. Any film or film series that causes people to run back to the bookstores and start reading again, is aces in my book, and I will be as sorry as anyone to see it all come to an end. But that said, RETURN OF THE KING cannot possibly get released fast enough!",Null,0,0,8 December 2003
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Life In Reverse
","It's Christmas Night. I have just returned from seeing what is easily the Best Film of 2008, and though there are some heavyweight contenders (or so I've heard), they would all have to go pretty far to beat THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMNIN BUTTON. I have seen MILK, and as close as that comes to taking the cake, it still has its work cut out for it when being compared to this bizarre, engrossing and ultimately moving tale of the life of one extraordinary man. David Fincher (SE7EN, ZODIAC, THE GAME, FIGHT CLUB) has just officially floored me. He would be the last director whose name would come to my mind when seeing a character- driven tale of such life-affirming power. Spielberg, yes; Chris Columbus, probably; Rob Reiner or Ron Howard, without a doubt, but David FINCHER? This movie is going to change his fortunes as a director.But not his alone. Brad Pitt officially joins the company of Newman, Redford and other memorable screen hunks whose status looms large in our consciousness not just as matinée idols, but as real ACTORS. As for Cate Blanchette, I've never doubted her acting ability, and she matches and compliments Brad scene-for-scene with a grace and subtlety that makes her other work pale by comparison. And for her, that is a stunning achievement. As for the rest of the cast, they all make me glad that I am not a voting member of the Academy: Taraji Henson (HUSTLE AND FLOW), Jason Flemyng (INDIAN SUMMER), Jared Harris, the luminous Tilda Swinton...I would never be able to single out just one of them as 'best', because each brings their own special 'something' to the table that this tale would've suffered so greatly without. Eric Roth, who did such an amazing job with the screenplay for FOREST GUMP has triumphed again, and this should be reflected at Oscar time as well.I don't want to give away a lot of the details, and even if I tried, I don't want to dilute your experience of seeing this film with some mundane attempt to describe how wonderful, sad, hysterically funny and moving it is overall. Simply saying that BENJAMIN BUTTON is the story about a man who lives his life in reverse, is like saying that ROOTS was the story about a slave. Or GONE WITH THE WIND was about a war. Or CITIZEN KANE was about a man who ran a newspaper. The less you know going in, the more astonished you'll be when you have seen this in its entirety - the FIRST time. Don't be daunted by the nearly three-hour running time. Like the best parts of your own life lived, it goes by in the blink of an eye.Well, mercifully, I will cut my senseless babbling short here. I only ask, no, BEG you to be sure not to wait for the DVD. Let that be the fate of all other movies you see from this year. But this one? Get to a theater and see it NOW. And take family and friends as well. It's the best holiday present you will give them....EVER.",10,4,9,25 December 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Girls With Ginsu's
","IT SLICES!!! IT DICES!!! IT JULIENNES!!!! Ron Popeil's latest kitchen invention? No, we're not talking infomercial here, but the 4th film by tyro filmbuff-turned-filmmaker Quentin Tarantino: 'Kill Bill.'If the opening line of this review made you chuckle even a little, then you are already in the right frame of mind to watch this movie. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then every director from Woo to DePalma to Scorsese, Leone and at least half the working directors in Hong Kong, will get a major case of 'swelled-head syndrome' watching this movie. Quentin has begged, borrowed and stolen from the best with this, and what he has wrought is one of the best examples of live-action anime ever done...even with a top-notch short anime feature thrown in, that would've been powerfully effective all by itself.Unless you've been living in a cave outside Iran for the past month, you already know the basics about the story: The Bride, a.k.a. Black Mamba (Quentin's muse, Uma Thurman), was once the lead member of the DiVAS, or Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Once she got preggers, though, it was all over but the garroting, as she decided to retire from the business of butchering, settle down and become a nice little housewife.
Unfortunately, her former boss and lover, the 'Bill' of the title, (the barely visible but very sinister David Carradine), doesn't have a very rewarding retirement plan, as Mamba finds out to her chagrin, when Bill sends her associates to the wedding rehearsal to give her a real sendoff. As in PERMANENT.But this Bride takes a lickin' and keeps on kickin'. Even after being brutally beaten, bludgeoned and even shot in the head by Mr. Bill himself, (not to mention having her comatose body sold into sexual slavery), Mamba has the wherewithal to survive for four years after the fact, get back on her feet, and go after her would-be killers one by one.
Volume One finds her pursuing the first two targets on her 'Death List': Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox,) who herself has become Little Miss Suzy Homemaker (and you oughta see the way she has around the kitchen!), and probably her most formidable opponent, the deadly Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, O-Ren Ishii, superbly played (of course!) by 'CHARLIE'S ANGELS' alum Lucy Liu. And take my word for it, she's no 'Angel' here. What her character is, though, is the subject of the startlingly good 'anime' portion of the movie, a revenge story in itself as brutal and disturbingly beautiful as the one that surrounds it.And no, as a now-often run scene from the preview suggests--the goal of The Bride's quest is not as easy to achieve as it may sound. Before the well-earned dessert of O-Ren's bloody demise, there is still the appetizer: an incredible battle with insane schoolgirl and Ishii's bodyguard/assassin, Go-Go Yubari, (Chiaki Kuriyama), who has a way with a ball-and-chain that no mere parochial student should. And the main course: one of the most violent setpieces ever commended to celluloid, Black Mamba's epic battle with O-Ren's personal army, the Crazy 88's (at which point, those not well-versed in anime, uncut samurai movies, or the skittishly squeamish should leave the theater IMMEDIATELY.) If anyone was wondering why there were so many audible chuckles during the credits, when the words 'Special Makeup Effects by KNB Studios' flashed across the screen, this scene will solve the mystery for you.Welcome to FanBoy Heaven. We have always known about Quentin's love of the art and artifice of 'grindhouse' classics, the kung-fu action and exploitation films that were the staples of a lot of Saturday mornings for red-blooded American moviewatching males. What makes 'Bill' so special is what drives the film so relentlessly: Tarantino's unbridled, and thoroughly un-jaded enthusiasm, which its beating (and yes, bleeding) heart. All the excited, long-after-midnight discussions about the fantastical images every fanboy would love to see if THEY could only make the 'ultimate' movie, is exactly what Quentin has done, and those audience members who just don't get it, probably never will.Witness all the homages on hand, from the themes resurrecting the dusty ghosts of 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,' 'Ironside' and 'The Green Hornet,' to direct lifts from Tobe Hooper's 'Eaten Alive,' Brian De Palma's 'Dressed To Kill,' and Scorsese's 'Casino.' And you couldn't possibly miss the cackles of glee that must've echoed across the 'Bill' set, as he directed scenes with yet another legendary childhood idol: the Toshiro Mifune of the ninjitsu grindhouse drama, Sonny Chiba, who stars here as the reincarnation of his most beloved character, Hattori Hanzo, 'the Man from Okinawa,' and a pivotal part of The Bride's quest for bad blood.So for those who would whine about the lack of thorough character development, and deftly written plot points, LOOK ELSEWHERE. 'Kill Bill' is more style than substance, because that's exactly what it's all about. Personally, the intellectual in me who loves 'Rashomon,' 'Knife In the Water,' 'The Piano' and 'Day For Night,' had a really difficult time respecting myself in the morning after seeing this.But the Mr. Hyde half who loved 'Death Machines,' 'Flying Fists of Fury,' 'Enter The Dragon' and 'Cleopatra Jones,' grinned maniacally back at me from the mirror, already capering with glee at the prospect of 'Kill Bill, Volume Two.' (Next on the Death List: Ellie Driver (Darryl Hannah), the sexy nurse with a blood-curdling bedside manner, Budd, a.k.a Sidewinder (RESERVOIR DOGS alum Michael Madsen), the only male DiVA in the group, and of course, Big Bill himself.)So whether you take that as a recommendation or a warning, is completely up to you. The effect that seeing this may have will be no different.",Null,0,1,21 October 2003
Paranormal Activity," Heavenly Hype, Earthbound Execution
","Now that the considerable hullabaloo has died down around this flick, I figured this was the perfect time to finally see it. Like its predecessor, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, the bombastic campaign that was used to roll this movie out was a marvel of hyperbole that the late, great schlockmeister showman William Castle would've loved. He had the P.T. Barnum-method of selling movies almost down to a science, understanding instinctively that as long as you have a gimmick and great pitch-line to sell it with, what did it matter if the film was crap?And the producers of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, along with writer/director Oren Peli have done absolutely NOTHING to prove him wrong. The film itself is neither as horrible as some people have made it out to be, nor is it 'THE MOST TERRIFYING MOVIE EVER MADE.' There are much better films made with even lower budgets that can rightfully lay claim to that title. But in Peli's defense, even though the premise is nothing new, (think of this as a much more 'up-close-and-personal' version of an episode of the Discovery Channel series A HAUNTING), he does err on the side of subtlety and understatement in the movie's more effective moments, where any other director would've opted for a maelstrom of CG effects and a thunderous soundtrack to beat the audience into the desired response. The greatest problem lies in the moments in-between the supernatural incidents, when the characters' responses to the extraordinary circumstances can leave you scratching your head in wonderment and more than a little skepticism. Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat - and that's pronounced 'MEE-kah' and not 'MYE-kah', BTW) are experiencing some strange occurrences in their house as the film begins. Micah, a baby of the 'techno-generation' through and through, has bought an expensive camera along with all the latest trimmings to try and capture these incidents, and couldn't be happier about getting to play with his new toys. Katie, on the other hand, couldn't be less enthusiastic, or more put out about Micah's connecting more with his gadgets and less with her sense of growing unease and distress. See, this is not her first time at this particular rodeo. Seems that there's an eerie history of this whole 'things-that-go-BUMP- in-the-night' problem in her family background, and though little things have happened that reflected this in their nearly three-year relationship, the incidents have never been as bad as they've gotten when we meet them. And of course, things are about to go from bad to a whole lot worse. As I mentioned before, the problem is not with the sequences where 'things' happen...doors move, bangs and creaks emerge from the walls at unexpected times, objects in the house get moved to places where they weren't before, amongst other things. The biggest obstacle is in the way the characters are written as a couple. Katie fares a lot better than Micah on the sympathy front - she doesn't understand how or why the phenomenon has followed her for so long, and just wants to find a way to stop it or at the very least, make it all go away. Micah, on the other hand, is just about completely oblivious to the glaring fact that he's facing forces that can't be taken care of by simply yelling them down or pointing a night-vision lens at them. As much as my dislike for his character grew by leaps and bounds, Micah Sloat the actor did a great job in capturing the self-centeredness and immaturity. I won't go into the complete 'WTF' moments that take the audience out of the spell of genuine terror the movie is attempting to weave, but you'll know them for sure when you see them. And by the time it reaches what is pretty much the expected denouement, you might be left feeling the sentiment expressed in the old Peggy Lee song: 'Is That All There Is?' PARANORMAL ACTIVITY gamely tries to apply classic tropes of otherworldly tales of spookery to our very post-modern, gadget-obsessed world, but for this viewer, it ultimately misses the mark. For egg-sized goosebumps, at least for my taste, you still can't beat classic films like the original version of THE HAUNTING or even THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE.",6,0,1,1 August 2010
The Dark Knight," The 'Descent Into The Maelstrom' Continues...
","With able assistance from brother Jonathan and co-scripter David S. Goyer, writer-director Chris Nolan continues to peel back the onion-like layers of the psyche and persona of Batman and his alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, and takes into account the wear and tear that serving as Gotham City's 'trash collector' has on Bruce's soul.Much has been made of the issue of whether or not the cast is up to the ability to ramp up their acting skills, to meet the challenges presented by one of the smartest scripts created so far for this series. I think that everyone does an arguably great job - from Christian Bale as the title hero-slowly-turning-into 'anti-hero', to the tragic optimism of Aaron Eckhardt as Harvey Dent.But make no mistake about it - good performances by the other principals being considered, THE DARK KNIGHT is, first and foremost, a centerpiece with only one performance as its spotlight: one of the most remarkable turns of villainy ever captured on film as performed by the late, great Heath Ledger.His Joker completely obliterates the memory of every other performance in the role before his (with sincere apologies to Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson.) So good is Ledger that he does not so much inhabit the role as he simply disappears into it. There are virtually no traces of someone acting here, but rather LIVING the role.The 'maelstrom' that results as a product of Bruce's inner struggle with good and evil and his outer battle with his arch-nemesis is aptly reflected in every aspect of the production, with the photography, production design, visual effects, scoring - each and every department is at the top of their game here.As far as this reviewer is concerned, no amount of acclaim is too much to praise Ledger's performance. And although it causes me to lament the towering career that this incredibly talented young man would've had if he had not left us so soon, his legacy to this series almost ensures that the filmmakers will honor him by striving to make the next installment one of the best sequels in a continuing series that has ever been produced.",10,3,7,9 December 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," 'Once fell in love and it was a gas/Soon turned out, I had a Heart Of Glass...'
","There's something that every great writer worth his weight in Number Two pencils knows about love, (as did the immortal Debbie Harry when she sang the phrase above). And it's this: as fragile as it is and therefore worth handling with the utmost care, none of us really know a damn thing about it or how to deal with it. Besides, when we fall in love with someone and they with us, we're not falling for one person, but three: the one that swept us off our feet in the first place; the person whom we hope they will become as we grow old together, and the person that they really are at the end of the day.And as our loved ones are a trio and not just one personality, our relationships ebb and flow in three stages: love's first rapturous blush, the 'big reveal' as we begin to find out things about this person that we love and hate, and the Last Stage, when the bloom is completely off the rose, and you have a decision to make--continue the journey on together, or find another traveling companion.All of the above and more is eloquently and brilliantly expressed in one of the best movies ever made on the subject, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. It comes as no big surprise that the co-author of this damn-near perfect deconstruction of desire and disappointment is one Charlie Kaufman (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, ADAPTATION). One of the bigger shocks is that the other writer and director is Michel Gondry, to whose work I have only been previously exposed via the hit-and-miss Robin Williams vehicle HUMAN NATURE. (Thank goodness that my first impression wasn't at all accurate. Ditto for Kaufman, who was just 'testing his swing' before hitting a homer with MALKOVICH.) We begin by meeting everyman Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a nice if somewhat non-descript guy, living a pretty much non-descript existence, his hopes, dreams, fears and desires neatly compartmentalized from the rest of his life inside his journal. Joel is sensible, practical, polite, thoughtful and never, ever impulsive. Then, he meets his polar opposite, Clementine, (Kate Winslet exploding out of Corset World). She is erratic, impulsive, confrontational, messy, intrusive and everything Joel couldn't possibly be on his worst day without Starbuck's. There is no reason on God's green earth they should be attracted to each other, but what do ya know? They are.And things go great for awhile, then from great to good, good to okay, okay to not-so-good, etc. When it gets beyond the last stage, Clementine decides that she wants Joel erased from her life forever, and as she is prone to do, she impulsively goes to a place called Lacuna, Inc., which specializes in just that...erasures. They literally wipe the slate clean - that slate being your mind - so that no trace and no memories of your ex will ever plague you again.Already heartbroken, when the devastated Joel learns what Clementine has done, he decides to do the same...only to discover (or re-discover) that not all the times they had together were awful, and that some memories are worth keeping forever, no matter what. And what he decides to do to try and hold on to those memories are where the story really kicks into gear, turning sublime, silly and very sad all at once.The joys and sorrows of discovering a tale this remarkable are always best experienced without a lot of foreknowledge, and that's how I will leave the more startling and surprising details...for you to find.All I can say is this: if no one had ever seen a Jim Carrey film before and this was his introduction to the world, it would be like seeing Tom Hanks for the first time. That is how complete and profound his transformation is into Joel. We like him, we REALLY, REALLY like him, and though we hardly want to see him suffer, we realize soon enough that what he goes through with 'darlin' Clementine' is totally necessary to transform them both into better people.Oh, yes, and there's Clemmy, herself. I always knew that Kate was dying to sink her teeth into a role that didn't require a corset and a bustle. (Helena Bonham Carter, eat your heart out!) If you are still wincing over TITANIC'S thick treacle, her performance in SUNSHINE will come as a tart but tasty surprise.And kudos must be given to the strong supporting cast. Kirsten Dunst showing a winsomeness she hasn't accessed in many moons; Elijah Wood in a role that is somehow slimy, pathetic and yet movingly sympathetic; Tom Wilkinson, Jane Adams and David Cross whose solid and invaluable work is integral to the plot, (but can't be commented on here without giving up some glaring spoilers), and Mark Ruffalo, who does the nearly impossible by making man-boy geekiness sexy.Most of all, we have to go back and high-five director Gondry, DP Ellen Kuras and editor Valdis Oskarsdottir for recognizing the special story that Kaufman fashioned, for letting it breathe and allowing it to go where it needed...to show the destructive and transforming power of love, and how and WHY we need it, no matter how high it lifts us up...or how hard it lets us fall.Everyone will take something different away from this, so see it with someone you're dating...or even someone you're breaking up with. You never know what might happen, and even at the worst times, there could still be good that comes from it...just ask Joel and Clem.",9,0,2,29 March 2006
Taken," You're Not Getting Older, You're Getting DEADLIER...
","Okay, so before I even start this one, let's go over all the quibbles, shall we? First and most noticeable is LOST'S Maggie Grace allegedly playing a teenager. We all know she probably was a little more 'mature' than even her character on the infuriatingly obtuse ABC hit, but did we care then? No, we didn't, so why all the fuss now? The cast of the original 90210 were a bunch of college-age (or WAY past college-age) actors playing teens, too, and that was still a hit. So to those nitpickers, get a life already.Next is the script. Dialogue that's less than cerebral? Check. Plot holes you could drive a Mack truck through? Double-check. That feel of trying to go after Matt Damon's BOURNE franchise and steal some of its audience? Check, check and check again. But then this movie is co-produced by Luc Besson (THE PROFESSIONAL, THE FIFTH ELEMENT, THE LAST COMBAT) who wrote TAKEN'S script with Robert Mark Kamen (THE KARATE KID) and was directed by Pierre Morel (the 'parkour'-infused post-apocalyptic thriller DISTRICT B-13.) If you came to this party expecting Bergmann or Bunuel, my friend, you just walked into the wrong freakin' party.Once you've adjusted your suspension of disbelief accordingly, you will realize what the true pleasure of TAKEN really is - and that's watching renowned, Oscar-and-Tony-nominated stage and screen actor Liam Neeson, now close to 60, step into the same arena as Damon, Jason Statham, Daniel Craig and his action-hero contemporary, Harrison Ford, and kick ass and take names with a panache that would make Jack Bauer beam with admiration. At least that's what I enjoyed the most about it. Neeson plays former government-operative-turned-security-consultant (read: bodyguard) Bryan Mills. Long retired from the more active aspect of his trade, he spends his time trying to maintain some facade of civility with his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen doing well in yet another thankless role) and her new rich gasbag of a husband (Xander Berkeley, ditto), so he can still maintain close ties with the one thing in his life that matters: his daughter, Kim (Grace.)When Kim and her BFF are allowed to take an ill-advised European vacation that delivers them right into the clutches of some foreign baddies specializing in the sex slave trade, Mills gets to spring into action in what is the quintessential older man's fantasy...becoming the super-action hero with mad fighting skills and endless resources that can be brought to bear, in order to do whatever it takes to kill the bad guys and save the damsel-in-distress - said 'damsel' in this case being your teenage daughter. Yes, there's plenty of accusations you can level at TAKEN: the further glorification of lawless violence (anyone who thinks that Neeson's Mills should be concerned about the rights of the criminals he obliterates is in for quite the profound shock); the more-than-obvious xenophobia (almost all the bad guys are Middle Eastern or something very close to it); the chauvinistic aspect of the story line (Mom's willfulness is what sets the whole mess in motion, when it turns out that 'Father Knew Best' after all the entire time.) But every action movie (Besson's especially) carries aspects of all these concerns. That having been said, if I'm going to see a film like TAKEN, I am not going to search for signs of political correctness. I want to see some greasy, sleazy, skeevy underworld types get their teeth and heads knocked in, and in that respect, this movie delivers, and just like actors half his age doing it, Neeson looks spectacular, as he moves and carries himself like the guy who can and will do whatever it takes to get the job done...especially when that job is saving and bringing home his loved ones.Yes, I've heard all the complaints, but what I really want to know is when Liam's going to step into Bryan Mills' shoes again? With all due respect to Kiefer Sutherland, maybe Mills is what '24' needs on the day Jack Bauer is permanently retired from CTU...or what's left of it.",8,2,4,1 March 2009
This Is Spinal Tap," The Finest Movie Ever Made About A Band That Never Was
","There have been many directors before Rob Reiner (Orson Welles immediately comes to mind), who could never break the curse of having made a brilliant debut with their initial directorial efforts. Depending on your world-view, you could say that since the release of 'Tap,' Reiner has become a seasoned, respected and prolific craftsman of some of the finest films that American cinema has to offer, or you could think of him as the cheesiest of Hollywood hack cheeseball sellouts.But diehard fans and despondent detractors have to agree on one thing: THIS IS SPINAL TAP still stands today as the best example of American comic satire ever done, especially about its particular subject. It is to rock and roll what MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL was to Arthurian mythology, and has so embedded itself into the lexicon of popular culture, that it has raised ire from the very bands it pokes fun at, and has even garnered a devoted cult of loyal fans worldwide who never 'got' the punchline: THE BAND DOESN'T EXIST!!From bands like The Beatles and The Stones, to heavy metal mavens and hair bands like Def Leppard, Ratt, Black Sabbath, Poison and Metallica, no one is spared. And I think what really distinguishes 'Tap' from similar movies that have been made since, the satirists responsible realized when they conceived it, that you have to have a genuine affection for the subject you are skewering. Which, ten years-plus after its initial release, still shows through in every performance and every line, scripted or ad-libbed.By now, if you know anything about rock, be it classic or contemporary, you have to have had some brush with the character archetypes so accurately portrayed here: Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer, all SNL alumni from that show's glory days, play lead singer/lead guitarist 'David St. Hubbins,' co-lead singer/lead guitarist 'Nigel Tufnel' and bassist/backing vocalist 'Derek Smalls,' respectively.
Erstwhile documentarian and bottom-rung commercial director Martin DiBergi (Reiner) jumped at the chance to film every sight, sound and smell of the latest tour of Tap, the band that shaped the director's whole outlook about music, especially rock and roll. What he captured during that period is the stuff that, cutting-edge back in its heyday, can now be seen every week on shows like VH1's BEHIND THE MUSIC or THE E!TRUE HOLLYWOOD STORY. Today's bands have not only managed to pattern themselves after Tap, but with all of their pomposity, egotism and displays of infantile sexuality and arrested emotional development in word, deed and song, they have surpassed them!The newly restored version should go into the very next time capsule that the Smithsonian or any similar organization decides to assemble. Like HOLY GRAIL, it only gets better and funnier with repeated viewings. Has success spoiled Rob Reiner? That depends on who you're talking to, but even the passage of time will never destroy or diminish his first and best work.",Null,0,2,4 November 2000
Grindhouse," Not Your Average Daily 'GRIND'...
","Now this was not a $70 million dollar box office barnburner as The Weinstein Company hoped it would be, and I don't know that they should be all that disappointed that it wasn't. Maybe Quentin and Robert never intended it to be. Guess nobody thought about that, did they? I think you have to be of a certain age to really, truly get into this double-header, and since I am, the coolest thing of all about GRINDHOUSE is that it feels like it was made just for me. I didn't see all that much drive-in action when I was coming up, but my neck of the woods in D.C. had more than its share of grindhouses, and did I fritter away a lot of my youth there or what? That precious time I spent made me the slobbering, slavering, mouth- frothing-wild-eyed horror/sci-fi junkie that I am today, and I wouldn't trade that education for anything in the world. I really liked all of RR's PLANET TERROR. It's so over-the-top splatterific, that as one of my friends pointed out, it's nearly a parody of a grindhouse film. QT's DEATH PROOF is like an Italian 'giallo' film given a hot beef injection of high-octane, muscle-car madness. Only problem is that you will either love or hate the first half-hour or so, which is almost completely nothing but character interaction between the nearly all-female cast. But I loved, loved, LOVED the second half! DEATH PROOF has one of the best car chases of this decade, if not THE best. Think I'm wrong? See it for yourself, then compare it to anything you've seen since 2000. Nothing can touch it. I stand by that statement 100%.Things I Dug The Most About GRINDHOUSE, in no particular order:MACHETE - Danny Trejo finally gets his real props, and I hope RR DOES make this one into a 'real' movie.THANKSGIVING - Before Eli Roth makes one more movie, he should watch his own trailer again and remember why this is the SICKEST idea in the world! And I mean that in a good way...DON'T - Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg know all about what made those Seventies British horror sagas so cheesy, screamy good, and he makes sure to stick the references all through here. EXCELLENT job.WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE S.S. - Best trailer for out-and-out laughs and execution, but the one that would most likely suck ass as a 'real' movie. But you gotta give Rob Zombie props for pulling out Sybil Danning. (Where the hell has SHE been???)CASTING FOR PLANET TERROR - This was one of the things that grindhouse movies were all about: the casting. Everybody did one helluva job, and I sure hope they all get more work from having done this gig, especially Michael Parks, Jeff Fahey, Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Freddy Rodriguez and Our Girl, Rose McGowan. And the guys at KNB had to be creaming themselves, for having finally gotten a huge internationally-known action star in their clutches. (I won't say who, but you already know him.)KNB Studios - You know Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero had multiple orgasms working on this flick. Tracy Thoms, Sydney Poitier, Vanessa Ferlito and Rosario Dawson - Just see DEATH PROOF and you'll know why.'The Crazy Babysitter Twins' - Don't get me started!Zoe Bell - Coolest, ballsiest stunt-PERSON ever. KILL BILL would have been crapola without her, and now I know why. QT has to make a movie just for her now.Kurt Russell - His 'Stuntman Mike' in DEATH PROOF may very well erase the memory of anything else he's ever done. And yes, that includes Jack Burton AND 'Snake' Plissken.RR's THEME FROM 'PLANET TERROR' - Every strip club in America will be ripping this song off, and don't think it won't be sampled in more than a few rap tunes. Final tally: GRINDHOUSE as an overall experience gets a 3-out-of-4 stars. PLANET TERROR rates about a 3.8. The Trailers all together get a 3.5 (but THANKSGIVING by itself is a definite 4.) DEATH PROOF also gets a 4. The well-written but slow dialogue sequences keep it from getting an out-and-out 5, but that last half-hour or so pushes it just above its companion.(This is based mainly on the theatrical experience. NOTE TO MIRAMAX: When you put out the DVD set that has BOTH MOVIES and the trailers intact, call me. Otherwise? Don't bother looking for my $$$...)",9,0,1,5 December 2008
Saw," 'SHARP', But Not Quite Sharp Enough
","Poor Wesley. For Cary Elwes, former beloved of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, this is about as far away from the beautiful, fairy-tale perfection of the fields of Florin as you can get. Now, he's Doctor Lawrence Gordon, barefoot and chained in the most hellishly nasty abandoned washroom you could possibly imagine, just like his fellow captive, Adam, (SAW'S author, Leigh Whannell.) They are both the latest victims of the dementedly brilliant serial killer, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell from THE X-FILES, amongst other things), who actually never kills any of his victims...he gets them to kill themselves, or each other, depending on what sick rules he's set for the twisted games he plays.SAW did gangbusters at the box office, and has many admirers...amongst those who probably haven't seen a lot of movies of its kind. But what Whannell and director James Wan have actually done is steal from the best, which is what most great filmmakers do. The biggest problem with doing it, is that when you do 'borrow' certain plot conventions, you have to do it in a way that one-ups the great sources you're stealing from. And since SAW cribs from SE7EN, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, AND THEN THERE WERE NONE and the cult classic THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES, it has already shot itself in the foot...so to speak, before it even gets started.Plus, in spite of some great photography, truly disturbing images and some well done moments of outright creepiness, you can't quite shake the feeling that Whannell and Wan were feeling a little too pleased with their own cleverness as they made it. The 'cherry' on top is one honey of a shocker ending, which unfortunately places it in BLAIR WITCH territory, as a film whose first 85 or so minutes just aren't as good as the last five.I wasn't as P.O.'ed by the end as I was with HIGH TENSION. Not a bad first effort, but the script could've definitely benefited from some more tweaking. And it might've helped if it had been an entirely unknown cast, instead of having the perfunctory low-budget 'guest appearances' (THE SHIELD'S Benito Martinez, STARSHIP TROOPERS' Dina Meyer, ALONG CAME A SPIDER'S Monica Potter, and most wasted of all, Danny Glover.) Good if you have never seen a serial killer/psycho-thriller before. But any one of the other films I mentioned will probably seem MUCH better than the first time, if you watch them right after seeing SAW.",7,0,1,4 March 2006
The Descent," Claustrophobia, Anyone?
","After the wild Army guys-vs.-werewolves ride that was DOG SOLDIERS, I was hoping that British director Neil Marshall would top himself with his next outing, and boy, was I NOT disappointed! I can guarantee that lovers of tough-chicks-kicking-ass-extravaganzas like ALIENS, the TERMINATOR films and even THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT will not be sorry they invested the time in making THE DESCENT. Even non-distaff-oriented horror fans won't see this one coming...or expect to enjoy it as much as I believe they will. But be forewarned: only a claustrophobic who has masochistic tendencies will be able to tough out some of the scenes in this movie. I'm not afflicted with this particular phobia, and there were moments when even I could feel my throat closing up....THE DESCENT is the story of Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) a free-spirited, adventurous gal whose world is completely shattered while on an outing with friends, when she survives a freak car collision that leaves her the sole survivor, taking the lives of her husband and child. (As many car accidents as I've seen in movies, this one still ranks as one of the most brutally horrific.) A year later, Sarah's best gal pal, Juno (Natalie Mendoza) reunites Sarah and all the girls for one mother of an adventure, to renew their bonds and to help Sarah heal from the tragedy. The objective: a spelunking expedition through an uncharted series of passages, in a well-traveled section of the Appalachians. Well, that's what the group believes, anyway. What they don't know is that the egotistic and headstrong Juno has a few 'surprises' in store for the ladies. And what none of them know is that the caves are holding their own nasty and terrifying surprises in store...Marshall is in top form here, and he proves that he can make a great film chock-a-block with female heroines as well as anything James Cameron or Ridley Scott has ever made. Though the cast is virtually made up of unknowns, they are engaging and compelling, each with her own personality and coping mechanisms to deal with situations that only get more and more harrowing by the minute. And though it is pretty much a horror film, it also has elements of a relationship drama, with a startling twist that will elicit as many gasps from the audience as some of the more brutal scenes that take place when the girls go deep into the caves and find...But I'm not going to tell you about THAT. You want spoilers? Go read the other reviews. The less you know about this movie going in, the better. Although there's not a serial killer in sight, I have to thank Mr. Marshall for THE DESCENT. As bitterly disappointed as I was with the potential promise of a movie like HIGH TENSION, he shows those filmmakers - and us - how it's really supposed to be done.",9,0,1,5 April 2008
Die Hard," No shoes, no socks, no shirt, no surrender...
","A barefoot, bare-chested Bruce Willis breaks the laws of gravity, the odds against good guys vs. Eurotrash terrorists, and Arnold's body count for a single film at that time, in the action movie that set the blueprint for everything that followed it, but rarely ever equaled it, (of course nowadays THE MATRIX took care of all that.)When hard-bitten New York cop John McClain (Willis) flies to L.A. for the holidays to visit estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), about the only thing on his mind was not fighting with her for Christmas. He never dreamed in a million years he'd end up fighting for his life, which is exactly what happens.Caught off-guard post-argument with Holly, and pre-completion of an after-flight freshening-up session, (the phrase 'making fists with your toes' was made for trivia heaven!), he becomes every screenwriter's dream of the perfect action hero: an ordinary guy caught in extraordinary circumstances with the ability to rise to the occasion. When Nakatomi Plaza (actually Fox's Century City offices) is taken over by 'terrorists,' McClain forgets marital woes and declares martial law in a one-man war against the armed intruders.Big, belligerent and boisterous, this was the action thriller at its most Hollywood-outlandish, but one of the main things going for it is what most thrillers that followed came up missing: characters we care about. Willis' McClain is a wiseacre hard-ass with a smart-mouthed crack for even the diciest situation, (honed by his years on MOONLIGHTING), but unlike AH-nuld, he is no Superman, and even as we laugh at the Wiley Coyote scrapes he gets himself into, we wince simultaneously at every-near miss, be it flying bullets or free-falls through umpteen story windows, and cheer each time his pluck and determination to get the bad guys and save his missus, brings him through.John McTiernan, who made his career with this film, (and was deathly afraid of heights while shooting it!) doesn't waste a single opportunity given him by the script to turn all the action set pieces up 'to ELEVEN!' Michael Kamen's Sturm-und-Drang scoring does some nifty things with Christmas carols and Beethoven's 'Ode To Joy' that were so original, everyone's been ripping off the score ever since, (including Kamen himself!)Best of all, though, is the note-perfect casting job. Besides Willis, British stage vet Alan Rickman oozed oily charm, unctuous ambition and tons of bad attitude as lead 'terrorist' Hans Gruber, who matched Bruce for every thrust and parry in their scenes together, both physically and verbally. Best of all, it's easy to see in the scenes that he carries without Willis, that Rickman is an actor with a future of memorable characters ahead of him, villainous and otherwise, (see him at his best in ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES.)Bruce was the one who initially suggested that John McClain have  a wife, and that she be played by Bonnie Bedelia. Smart move on Joel Silver's part that he took that advice, because as the 'damsel-in-distress,' Bonnie comes across about as helpless as Bette Davis! The screen crackles with the chemistry between her and Willis as they argue like a husband and wife at odds, trying  to find their way back to common ground. And even when face to face with the baddies, she makes it clear that she's got bigger brass cojones than all of them combined.As for the rest of the supporting cast, their characters have become archetypical staples in the action genre by now: Reginald VelJohnson's Sgt. Al Powell, John's one-man cheering section on the outside; Paul Gleason as the inept cop-in-charge who'd like to shoot McClain as much as he would the terrorists; Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush as the F.B.I. hotshots; William Atherton as the snide, sniveling, career-driven reporter he played so well, he'd be back in the sequel; James Shigeta as Holly's noble and doomed boss Joe Takagi; Hart Bochner as the hop-headed hostage and all-around jerk who thinks he can 'cut a deal' with Gruber; Devoreaux White and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as Argyle, McClain's driver, and a nerdy high-tech terrorist, respectively, and then on the bad guy's team, the late and still great Alexander Godunov, Lorenzo Caccialanza, and Al Leong as a greedy gunslinger with a sweet tooth.At a time when action-starved fans were moaning that they didn't make 'em 'like they used to,' DIE HARD came along and proved them right. They didn't...now they were making 'em BETTER than that.I cannot believe there is one movie lover on Earth who hasn't seen this at least once, so if you haven't, save yourself the rental bills you'll run up from repeated viewings, for God's sake, and just BUY it! It will become a permanent part of your library, I promise you. YIPPEE-KI-AY....",Null,1,2,1 December 2000
Rosemary's Baby," A Traumatic Trailblazer...
","THIS is the movie that made it possible to get films like THE EXORCIST and THE OMEN green-lighted. You have to be of a certain age to remember, let alone appreciate this one, because too many of 'today's generation' of horror film lovers have been spoon-fed so much absolute crap, they won't watch anything that doesn't have limbs and blood-filled condom squibs flying everywhere. Too bad. ROSEMARY'S BABY, though somewhat dated, is still a classic case of big-city paranoia multiplied exponentially.It was William Castle who optioned Ira Levin's chart-burning bestseller, but Paramount had absolutely no confidence in his directorial abilities by this time, so the job of adaptation and direction was handed off to red-hot auteur Roman Polanski, (who - considering the tragic events that tore apart his life - was perfect for the job,) leaving Castle to produce. In hindsight, it was probably a really good idea, since the story is rooted firmly in those crazy themes that are Polanski's bread and butter - urban angst, isolation, and fear of the unknown...more the kind of unknown about your other half, your neighbors and especially yourself. Mia Farrow (whose career was practically made by this movie) and critically-acclaimed actor/filmmaker John Cassavettes were perfectly cast as Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse, blushingly naive newlyweds who move into a huge brownstone in Manhattan as Guy's acting career is just starting to take off. (The infamously famous Dakota - yes, THAT one - stars as their new digs.) It's big, it's dark and it's tremendously creepy in a way that undoubtedly inspired a lot of movies after it - think a much older version of Sigourney Weaver's poltergeist-infested penthouse in GHOSTBUSTERS. In other words: the perfect place to find some supernatural mischief going on.Which is not what Guy and Rosemary find...well, not at first. The most they discover is that they have a pair of unbelievably friendly - and nosy - neighbors, an older couple named Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer, and in her Oscar-winning turn, the late, great Ruth Gordon.) The Castevets are just a little too interested in Guy and Rosemary's personal life, their day-to-day comings and goings, and the fact that the younger couple is very determined in adding a third member of the family very soon. Remember how your mother told you never to talk to strangers? Let me add a new rule: never accept suspicious gifts or food products from the kindly little old lady next door. Besides that, there's all kinds of strange noises and general weirdness going on, conveniently when Rosie's at home by herself and Guy's out working. The important thing to pay attention to is how Rosemary's freaked-out state of mind, combined with the creepy influence of the brownstone, plays an important part in the goings-on around her. Especially when people start dying - from the nice girl from across the hall she meets who 'commits suicide', to the sudden illness and demise of family friend, Hutch (Maurice Evans). Oh, and to top it all off is one of the most chilling sequences in horror, when she does get pregnant...but there's a really good chance that Guy's not the daddy. (I don't think I have to go into a lot of details - you get the picture.)Okay, so basically, the clothes, the surroundings, the pop-culture references are 'ancient' enough to leave most newbies scratching their heads. Pay no attention to that stuff, my dears. Just let yourself soak up the atmosphere of menace and dread so superbly provided by Polanski, production designer Richard Sylbert and DP Bill Fraker (not to mention the spine-freezing score by Polish composer Krzystof Komeda). And enjoy the great performances by the leads and all the supporting cast, but especially Ms. Gordon. You'll never think of 'Noo-Yawk' grand-bubbie types the same way again. As far as recommendations go, this is NOT a rental. If you're a true horror fan, you should already have this as an essential part of your library, in the 'Satanic Specialties' section.",9,1,2,5 December 2008
30 Days of Night," Now Here's a Vampire Movie To Sink Your Teeth Into...And Vice-Versa...
","So you say you like your vampires that are all harpsichord-playing, puffy-shirt wearing, emo-with-extra-eye-shadow and a side order of existential angst to go? If that's your cuppa blood, you might want to stay as far away from 30 DAYS OF NIGHT as you can. Here, there be monsters. These vamps are not quick with witty bon-mots, not romantic, seductive or sexy by any stretch of the imagination. They look at human beings the way we look at cattle. They're hungry. You're food. End of story. And if that were just the story, that alone would be enough. If you've seen the vampires from movies like JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRE$, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and NEAR DARK, you know the damage they can do; the havoc they can wreak.Now...imagine them doing it in a town where THERE IS NO DAYLIGHT.And that is the basic premise, just like the graphic novel it's based on, (which I hadn't read before seeing this, but I will sure read the entire series now!) In Barrow, Alaska, there is a period during the start of winter's depths, where there is no sunrise or sunset for a month. Those who can't bear the 'longest night of the year' get the you-know-what out of Dodge, while the hardier souls stay to tough it out.Only this year, that thirty-day period is going to change the lives of the town and its inhabitants forever. A stranger is coming...and right behind him, Death follows. Video and now feature-director David Slade cut his teeth with HARD CANDY for his big- screen debut. I have not seen that film, but it comes highly recommended...with a warning. I guess it's going to be a pattern with his movies, because I am definitely making the same kind of recommendation with 30 DAYS. Lovers of anemic, bland, PG-13 rated schlock should probably stop reading here and go see the PROM NIGHT remake for the eighteenth time. Slade kicks it old-school here - kind of like a Hammer film on steroids, without the heaving cleavage and horse-and-carriage chases - and doesn't skimp on the blood and violence. It's also great that at least some time is taken for character development before the slaughtering starts. The usually ill-used Josh Hartnett shines here as Barrow's sheriff and reluctant hero Eben Olesen, a role that allows him to be much less...pretty, shall we say, than some of the romantic dramedy stuff he used to get pigeonholed into. Melissa George also made a great first impression on me as Stella, Eben's strong-willed, feisty ex, whose moxie definitely comes in handy when things get hairy...and 'FANG-EY'... And kudos must definitely go to Ben Foster (SIX FEET UNDER, X-MEN 3, HOSTAGE), for playing a character so skeevy you can almost SMELL HIM whenever he comes on-screen. Ditto to underrated actor Danny Huston, who makes one of the most wholehearted commitments to a role of pure, black-hearted evil I have seen since Anthony Hopkins went hunting for a nice Chianti to go with the fava beans. His late dad, John, would be proud.I know that most audiences these days just want their blood and guts and they want it NOW, but be patient and give this flick a chance. It does take its time getting started, but once it does, it becomes pretty clear that its R-rating was well-earned. And I have to mention that this is one of the most beautiful-looking horror films recently. The photography and art direction are unbelievable, (check out the DVD extras for the striking comparison between the movie stills and the novel's original artwork.) And the impressive visual and special effects come courtesy of the WETA Workshop in New Zealand. If you are a LORD OF THE RINGS fan, a Peter Jackson fan, or know anything about this outfit, you know that's all I need to say...It's the equivalent of having Tom Savini, Rick Baker and John Carl Buechler all working together at once. 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is definitely one of the best and most terrifying two-hour periods you will ever spend in the dark...But at least, unlike a good portion of the people of Barrow, YOU will survive it...",9,1,3,5 May 2008
Wedding Crashers," The Exuberance of Deception
","That is the only way to describe the opening sequence of WEDDING CRASHERS, the newly minted first-time pairing of comedy tyros Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson, as it attempts to clear its biggest hurdle: making palatable the unsavory premise of two overgrown fratboys with only one thing in mind--infiltrating weddings to eat, drink, be merry, and put the make ON 'Mary'...and June and Lisa and Jennifer and any other bridesmaids unlucky or naive enough to fall into their clutches.Thanks to the irresistible laid-back charms of Wilson and the hysterically sharp improv-riffing skills of Vaughan, that hurdle is pretty much cleared. It's a good thing, too, because without two likable leads, the entire movie would've fallen apart like a soufflé in an oven where somebody slammed the door before it had a chance to rise.Vaughan and Wilson's marital mediators-turned-marital opportunists Jeremy Gray and John Beckwith, respectively, have honed their reception-razing skills to a science, guaranteeing them a never-ending supply of nosh and 'nookie' on a Dionysan scale. But then they get greedy about it, and the wedding cake truly hits the fan.Toward the end of one long streak of successful crashes, (that opening montage), Jeremy decides that they should set their sites on the Crown Jewel of weddings: the impending nuptials of the eldest daughter of Secretary of the Treasury Cleary (Christopher Walken). Getting in will prove to be a whole lot easier than getting out for the two lotharios, as they met their matches in the indomitable Cleary sisters...as John falls head over heels for the beautiful Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) and Jeremy gets literally taken by the goofily predatory Gloria Cleary, (the sublime newcomer Isla Fisher.) The bulk of the comedy comes from the politically-incorrect and scatological humor that unfolds from increasingly uncomfortable situations, arising from the boys' deepening involvement with the not-so-normal Cleary family, including the obligatory potty-mouthed grandmother (Ellen Albertini Dow), the soused nymphomaniac spouse (Jane Seymour cast well against type) and the steroidally homicidal fiancée of Claire (Bradley Cooper).Seekers of more 'refined' adult entertainment, consider yourself warned well in advance: if you weren't enamored by the charms of such comedies as 'American Pie' or 'There's Something About Mary,' you won't find a lot here to tickle your fancy.Having said that, let me add that for what it is, director David Dobkin has done an admirable job. As a matter of fact, Dobkin seems to be the only director who knows how to tap into Vaughan's manic energy and Wilson's surfer-dude vibe to maximum positive effect, (he directed Vaughan in the underrated black comedy CLAY PIGEONS, and Wilson in the SHANGHAI NOON/KNIGHTS franchise). Though it stretches on for the better part of two hours, it achieves its goal of leaving its target audience thoroughly entertained.As has been mentioned before, however, when Dobkin and screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher make the choice to try and inject 'meaningful dramatic weight' into the jokey proceedings, the whole thing nearly comes to a screeching halt. The faux pas is somewhat redeemed by the special guest appearance of a certain SNL alum, (but I won't spoil the surprise by telling you who it is.) That does jump-start things back to life, but the character the guest plays is so much skeevier than Our Heroes were at their worst behavior, that it threatens to take a detour into some extremely uncomfortable territory. (Which is saying something after jokes about masturbation, prodigious vomiting, bondage, posterior shotgun wounds and other delights.) Thankfully, before WEDDING CRASHERS can crash, it is well into the third act, which ends on an agreeable note, and a lot less predictably than I expected.Hardly the bottom of the barrel in the annals of low comedy, (that prize would have to be awarded to the likes of FREDDY GOT FINGERED), WEDDING CRASHERS is great for a hysterically funny evening soon-to-be-forgotten with the half empty large soda and popcorn boxes.What we will hope to see more of is the pairing of Vaughan and Wilson again, hopefully under the direction of Dobkin, with a much more 'acceptable' comedic premise to more of the mass audience.And let's not forget two of the brightest spots in this comedy: Isla Fisher, whose overcaffeinated gift for physical comedy matches Vaughan's scene-for-scene (and LITERALLY 'stroke-for-stroke') and the beautiful Rachel McAdams, whose star is rapidly rising (she will soon be seen as the damsel-in-distress-du-jour in Wes Craven's latest terror-opus, RED-EYE, opposite 28 DAYS LATER'S Cillian Murphy).",8,0,1,6 August 2005
The Green Mile," A Film That Is Itself A 'Miracle'...
","Here we are, seven years after the release of THE GREEN MILE, and it still retains all of its power and wonder. 'Modern classic' is a term that gets bandied about far too loosely these days, but if there's at least one film from the last decade or so that solidly qualifies for that accolade, this is it.Both a personal memoir and a provocative story about injustice, suffering, and the depths of both depravity and compassion that can be found in the recesses of the human heart, it is the story of Paul Edgecomb, (a nearly perfect Tom Hanks), and his stint as the head prison guard, running the section of Death Row known as 'The Green Mile,' in a penitentiary, circa the 1930's. Suffering from a severe infection that year, Paul is badly in need of a miracle when the most amazing one of all comes into his life, and the lives of the men who live - and die - on the 'Mile.' His name is John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a gentle giant of an inmate charged with the brutal rape and murder of two little girls. The meek and passive demeanor of this man hardly seems a match for the horrible acts he's been charged with, but that's not even half the story. A spellbinding and escalating series of events take place involving John that not only changes Paul's life, but indicates that there are forces greater than ourselves that exist in the universe, and that miracles can only happen when we finally believe in them.Tales like THE GREEN MILE are the reason why I became a movie lover in the first place, and if writer/director Frank Darabont deserved every award nod he received for his take on another Stephen King story, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, he should have won every single award for this one.And not a discouraging word can be said about this cast. Not a single actor has done work this remarkable since, but then this script and story are one of those things that comes along but once in a lifetime.Be prepared to be entertained, mesmerized and moved beyond anything you might expect from a three-hour film that makes time seem immaterial. And bring plenty of Kleenex, regardless of your gender, for one of the most unforgettable endings ever.I am more than happy to give this film IMDb's highest rating, and my highest recommendation.",10,0,2,10 October 2006
Jaws," The Ocean Was Wet...And So Were The Theater Seats!
","With the dawn of the movie blockbuster, Hollywood unintentionally achieved two goals: with THE EXORCIST, they scared a legion of moviegoers back into church, literally. And with JAWS, they scared them out of the water, in some cases, permanently. The simple, pleasurable act that virtually defines summertime - going swimming at the beach - would never be the same again. And also, the audience love affair with a new, young, talented director by the name of Spielberg spanned into a marriage that lasted for both better and worse, over the course of damn near forty years! Whether you think of it as an adventure film with horror movie overtones, or a horror film that offers one hell of an adventurous ride as a bonus, there has never been anything quite like it. Based on the late Peter Benchley's runaway best seller, the plot is quite simple. Following a lead very similar to the one that Hitchcock had previously set with THE BIRDS, a unusually large Great White shark shows up in the calm, blue waters just off the coast of Amity Island, (played superbly by Martha's Vineyard), and begins to snack on the unwary and unwise tourists and townies who decide to engage in nautical activities at the wrong time. The town's police chief (Roy Scheider), a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a grizzled shark hunter (Robert Shaw) decide to deal with it the best way they know how. Needless to say, the three men's lives are changed forever by the encounter.JAWS has long been an indelible entry into the lexicon of pop culture slang and references. There are times even now when someone can hum the ominous notes of John Williams' familiar theme, and watch their best friends' faces turn ashen as they mutter 'That's not funny.' For those who keep score of such things, many will remember this as the first American-made film to ever gross over one hundred million dollars domestically. I will always remember it with great fondness as the first film that caused people in darkened theaters across the nation to drop their buckets of popcorn, and maybe check their shorts as well, myself included.For those rare viewers who have never seen this classic before in life, you have my envy and my sympathy. Envy, because there is nothing else in the world like seeing JAWS for the very first time. And sympathy, because no matter how great your HDTV and your home sound system is, there will never again be an experience like seeing it for the first time on the BIG screen. This is one of those rare ones that deserves four out of four stars, for great reasons.",10,2,4,11 March 2006
Scream," Third Time's The 'Harm'...
","By 1996, horror films were at a low-ebb again in terms of originality and the number released in theaters. But as this always happens every few decades or so, a young hotshot director and/or writer shows up with something that shakes things up again, if only temporarily.However, in this case the 'young upstart' was actually an old hand at the game. Wes Craven had 'rebooted' the genre twice before, with the uncompromising LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, and then again with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. And how would he launch a new trend in horror? By tapping the talents of a then sizzling-hot 'new' writer named Kevin Williamson, the creative force behind the hit teen dramedy DAWSON'S CREEK.What made the first installment of SCREAM so unique, is that it took all the conventional rules of horror that an entire generation had learned by seeing 'FRIDAY THE 13th', HALLOWEEN and Craven's own ELM STREET series on home video, and gave them a playful, self-referential tweak. And the twist started with an opening sequence that horror fans are still talking about to this day.Hitchcock stunned the movie world back in the Sixties, by killing off his lead heroine halfway through the classic PSYCHO. Craven and Williamson took his established rule and ran with it, going the Master one better...by killing off the 'heroine' in the FIRST TEN MINUTES!If it had been some bit player from a soap or a sitcom, the scene wouldn't have made much of an impact. But it's DREW BARRYMORE, an immediately recognizable face playing the doomed Casey Becker, who learns the hard way not to play 'Horror Movie Trivial Pursuit' on the phone with a knife-wielding psychopath...especially if your answers are WRONG!The audience is then thrust into a slasherific whoddunit as a group of Casey's classmates, all relatively unknown actors at the time, try to figure out who's doing the killing...and who may be next, all the time aware that they are in their own 'real-life' horror movie, where the killer knows the rules as well as they do.And as if to underscore the irony, there are several prominent cameos that are a nostalgia and/or trivia lover's dream, from Linda Blair and Henry Winkler, to Joseph Whipp (who sort of reprises his brief role in ELM STREET) to the director himself (look closely).It was a surprising and engaging way to 'freshen up' time-tested horror conventions, and even now, ten years later, it still holds up pretty well. Only many of the actors have moved on to become bigger stars (Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, Courteney Cox-Arquette, husband David Arquette, Liev Schreiber) or major players in Tinseltown as well, (Drew Barrymore, Jamie Kennedy).The brilliant scenario dreamed up by Williamson and Craven then is something of a cliché now, (with the satire parodied again in the SCARY MOVIE franchise), which somewhat explains the current lean of Hollyweird towards remaking classics and B-movies alike. Nothing this original would really surface again until a few bright sparks burst on the horizon, like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT or Lucky McKee's challenging MAY. Which brings us to where we are now.Pop in a copy of SCREAM today, and enjoy your ride 'back to the future' of the genre.",8,0,0,4 December 2008
Halloween," A Simple Tale, Simply Told and Simply Terrifying...
","Critics may pooh-pooh and look down their noses and conservative types might cluck their tongues and shake their heads in disapproval, but like every other movie genre, horror films have contributed valid classics that have stood the test of time and continue to do so, as they will when most of my generation is just a fading memory.Case in point: this year, HALLOWEEN is THIRTY YEARS OLD! Think about that, peeps. The movie that made John Carpenter and so many of the people connected with the film into household names...we are still talking about it, debating it, admiring it, and many, many other people will do so after us. That's not just the mark of a great horror film, but a great film, PERIOD.If you fancy yourself a horror fan, then you are definitely worth your weight in severed heads if you already know the back-history of this movie. And assuming you do, I won't bore you with the trivia and go right to the deceptively simple story.It all takes place on October 31st, 1978 in Haddonfield, Illinois. Three best friends: Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), Lynda (P.J. Soles) and Annie (Nancy Loomis) will all be babysitting only a few doors away from each other. The usual tricks and treats including late night spook shows, boyfriends sneaking over, pumpkin-carving and popcorn will be expected.What won't be expected is an uninvited guest to the festivities. Some years ago, on the very street where the girls live, a young boy named Michael Myers stabbed his sister Judith to death, only moments after she'd finished having sex with her boyfriend. He was taken away and placed in an asylum.And now Michael has escaped...to come home and for some reason, is determined to finish what he started, killing his 'sister' over and over again. And guess who the replacements for poor Judith are? The girls' only hope for possibly surviving the night is Michael's former doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance), who knows exactly what his patient is capable of and what he really is, and that stopping him at any cost is the only priority he has in life. Yes, it's a slasher film and the plot defines it as such. But no other film of its kind looked, sounded or played quite like what the creative team of John Carpenter and Debra Hill managed to capture on film, thanks to a game and enthusiastic crew and a talented cast of then-unknowns, all working more for the thrill of making a movie than for the money, (which there was very little of at first .) So much has already been written about this movie, that there's very little of value that I can add. Except to say that everything that we horror hounds hold dear owes a debt of thanks to HALLOWEEN. If PSYCHO was the door to the future of horror films, this was the key that unlocked it, and thanks to Carpenter and company, Friday THE 13TH, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and everything else that followed got to 'come inside.'This should be the cornerstone of your DVD or VHS horror collection. It certainly is in mine.",10,0,1,4 December 2008
Carrie," The One That Started It All...
","It has been copied, remade, parodied and lampooned, and forever become a part of the lexicon of popular culture. But whether you love it, hate it or are indifferent about it, no one can deny the impact that CARRIE has made on everyone who grew up in the Seventies...or that it continues to resonate with new audiences even today.Based on the very first runaway bestseller by Stephen King, this was a tale that acknowledged the peril-laden sharks-and-piranha-filled environment that was high school. Teasing, bullying, ostracism and how shockingly (at least back in the day) the girls were more adept at practicing casual cruelty than boys would ever be. Into this circle of Hell as yet undocumented by Dante, comes poor Carrie White. No friends, a bleak future at best, and her only family being her Christian funda-MENTAL-ist wack-job of a mother, the last thing she needs is to become the favorite scapegoat of two of the meanest of the 'Mean Girls' at Bates High School...Blond, frosty bitch-goddess Chris Hargensen and her irritating sidekick, Norma Watson. But that Carrie does, and the taunts, teasing and relentless bullying reaches its breaking point, when a terrified and clueless Carrie experiences her period for the very first time in the girls' locker room, and the resulting chaos resembles an all-female version of LORD OF THE FLIES (if you add flying tampons). But that very day, Carrie discovers something else she possesses....Latent telekinetic powers that have been unearthed along with her traumatic introduction into womanhood. Nobody knows - not the teachers, her tormentors or even her mother - and as Carrie begins to discover that maybe she does have a chance to assert herself and find some kind of happiness after all, the stage is set for a teenage tragedy of epic proportions.A lot of things were at stake with this film. It was Brian de Palma's last chance to prove himself as both an auteur worthy of carrying the torch for his hero, Alfred Hitchcock, and as a director capable of producing a box-office smash. It was THE long-shot at the big time for a cast of virtual unknowns: Sissy Spacek as the tortured title character; Piper Laurie, leaving semi-retirement to play religious fanatic Margaret White, Carrie's mother; Nancy Allen (a future Mrs. de Palma) and P.J. Soles as Chris and Norma respectively; Broadway and film star Betty Buckley playing the sympathetic gym teacher Miss Collins; Amy Irving (one of the future Mrs. Steven Spielbergs) as Sue Snell, the only girl on Carrie's side; William Katt (THE GREATEST American HERO) as Tommy Ross, Sue's BMOC boyfriend and the key to Carrie's downfall; and in a cameo that would send his career skyrocketing, John Travolta as Chris Hargensen's lunk-headed boyfriend, Billy Nolen. Some films are so bad that for those who participate in them in front of and behind the camera, no one's career is left unscathed. Happily, in the case of CARRIE, the exact opposite was true. Where de Palma's penchant for raiding Hitchcock's bag of tricks usually got him into serious trouble, he was firing on all cylinders with CARRIE, because it all worked perfectly. Everything - from the dynamic performances (both Spacek and Laurie were Oscar nominees), to Mario Tosi's photography and Pino Donaggio's unforgettable score - meshed together to go above and beyond King's effectively horrifying prose, and what resulted was a tale told about the hopefulness - and horror - of humanity, that has served as a genre touchstone for nearly four decades. All this time has passed, and even having seen it about two dozen times or more, the movie never fails to affect me. I almost envy those who have never seen it, because there is nothing like the first time. The experience will never leave you....EVER...",10,2,3,28 April 2008
1408," Don't 'OVERLOOK' This One...
","Stephen King has always been a big fan of haunted places, and has carried on the honored literary tradition of introducing his legions of fans to locations that are completely terrifying and unforgettable. At the top of the list (at least for me) would have to be THE SHINING'S Overlook Hotel and the Marsten House from 'SALEM'S LOT. Well, one visit to 1408, and suddenly you'll realize that those two garden spots for supernatural shocks are just for wimps. If you can survive an hour in this particular room, you can survive anything. Unfortunately, author Mike Enslin (John Cusack) doesn't know this. Once a terrible family tragedy shattered his life, he devoted the bulk of his career to writing about and demystifying the supernatural, the unexplainable. He travels around the country, staying at so-called haunted hotels, mansions, houses and other places, then writing about them in cult-worthy bargain-bin knockoffs with titles like 'The 10 Most Violent Vacation Spots', that sort of thing. Most of the tales of local spookery are nothing more than feeble fables, gussied up by the proprietors of failing lodgings and B&B's to drum up customers to pump up their sagging businesses. But one day, as he's thumbing through the mound of letters and postcards he receives daily from places who would welcome one of his visits, one postcard catches his eye. It's from the world-famous Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan, and the message is clear and simple: 'DO NOT ENTER 1408.'Used to having people all but bribe him to come and check out their haunted hostels, the message piques Mike's interest. He wants into this room in the worst way, even after he meets the more-than-slightly menacing General Manager of the Dolphin, Mr. Gerald Olin, (Samuel L. Jackson in an elegantly eerie role.) With the greatest reluctance and the most dire warnings to Mike imaginable, Olin finally forks over the key to the one room the Dolphin usually refuses to check anyone into...and where over 50 guests in the hotel's nearly 100-year history have availed themselves of a very special kind of 'express check-out' service...using every method from homemade nooses and straight razors, to taking swan dives out of the window...It isn't long after he checks into 1408, that Mike begins to realize how right Mr. Olin was. It's going to be one stay he'll remember for a very long time...and so will you.I didn't have the pleasure of reading the short story that was the basis of this script. I was also not familiar with director Mikael Hafstrom's other work, since I have yet to see DERAILED. One thing's pretty clear: Hafstrom and writers Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski are definitely die-hard King fans, because even if they aren't slavishly faithful to the original prose, the FEEL of a King story is there, much in the same way the skillful adaptations of Frank Darabont capture the essence as well. The creeping sense of dread and unease; that queasy, rattling feeling that everything is slightly off-kilter and about to get MUCH worse...that's in the best and most unsettling parts of King's writing.Casting John Cusack was a brilliant idea. Not since roles like his turn in THE GRIFTERS has he gotten the chance to work with a character and a scenario that lets him explore such a wide range of emotional states. Not to mention that he provides us with something of a rarity these days in horror films - a three-dimensional hero who you actually give a damn about, and find yourself rooting for when the odds get as stacked against him as mind-bendingly possible. And though Sam Jackson's role in 1408 is so short that it would be considered an insult to his fans in any other film, for his role a little bit goes a long way, and he makes the most of his turn as the mysterious Mr. Olin...who has an agenda all his own in getting Mike Enslin into what has to be the most evil and most haunted room in the world. While I'm at it, mention must be made of a quick but terrifyingly effective cameo from stage and screen vet Len Cariou. With just the way he said a single line, that alone left more egg- sized goosebumps on my forearms than the top three slasher series combined. Talk about less being more? Mr. Cariou makes it into an art form.Which reminds me - you can't forget the most important character of all...1408 itself. A place more terrible and insidious than probably any other of Stephen King's creations, not because of its reputation, but because of how it earned that reputation. There's evil, and possession, and the trapped and tormented spirits of the dead stuck between worlds. And then there's something just a little worse than that...But why spoil the surprises for you? Every element that goes into the creation of a great horror movie AND a psychological thriller is here.

Iron Man," Rise Of The New Superhero...
","After all of the troubles that Robert Downey Jr. went through in the late Nineties and through the better part of this advancing decade, it would take a larger-than-life character to get him and his career back on track. Thankfully, Tony Stark came along just in the nick of time, the way he does quite often to save the day in IRON MAN.Much has been made of Mack-truck-sized plot holes, deviations from original character motivations and the like. What people seem to be missing is that for the first time in a LONG time, we have a summer movie that puts the 'WOW!' Factor back into summer movie-going again.Remember when the bar for special visual effects was raised by films such as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, STAR TREK 2, and some little swashbuckler in space made by a bearded fanboy geek-turned-filmmaker named George Lucas? Well, all of the best things about the technology that we've always hoped for are here, in the form of CGI, animation and practical effects that blend so seamlessly and with astounding precision, that even the mind-bending effects of THE MATRIX series now seem passé. But best of all, where movies of this caliber that excel in the special effects areas always come up lacking in terms of story-telling and acting, IRON MAN delivers the goods in every conceivable way. Downey Jr. makes Stark a likable, roguish charmer - the kind of cool, laid-back, hedonistic party animal that makes his contemporaries like Bruce Wayne look like they're standing still. This is the kind of role he has always excelled at, and when the time comes for Stark to eat a great big helping of humble pie and experience the epiphany that transforms him into more than just an opportunistic death dealer, his real-life experiences seem to inform his performance with the kind of pathos and heart that will be hard to find in other leading hero roles this summer, (with the possible exception of that guy with the hat and the whip.)Though a little more time could've been spent developing their roles, Downey has great support with the always excellent Terrance Howard, Clark Gregg, Jon Favreau (the director in one of his Hitchcockian cameos) and Leslie Bibb as the inescapable gorgeous-and-nosy gal reporter. Special mention should be made of Faran Tahir as the 'McGuffin' baddie of the piece, and Shaun Toub as an unlikely but formidable and admirable ally named Yinsen. The two most impressive co-stars, however, are Gwyneth Paltrow, who has to be the most unlikely superhero love interest since Margot Kidder, and Jeff Bridges, aging nicely into 'hot daddy' mode as Stark's partner and eventual nemesis, Obediah 'Obie' Stane. The chemistry crackles between Downey Jr. and Paltrow almost immediately, which is really important to make unrequited romance work and hold the audience's attention, when the rest of the time is comprised of myriad 'stuff that blows up real good.' Their banter and attraction could fuel a couple dozen limp-and-lifeless summer rom-coms, so it's a nice surprise to find it here.As for Bridges, his dad would be bursting with pride. Jeff is specializing more and more in guest shots and character roles rather than those of his former 'leading stud' niche, and each one has fit him nicely. Though a little more background on Obie would've been nice, this one is no exception. His rage at having to play second fiddle to his young protégé definitely comes through in their eventual confrontations, and that needs no further explanation or exposition to justify it.As an independent studio, Marvel has redefined the paradigm for how to make a comic book adaptation work with IRON MAN. Let's see if any of their rivals are up to meeting the challenge...",9,1,2,26 May 2008
Casino Royale," You Won't Mind Trying This Kind Of 'BOND-age'...
","My thoughts on the recent 'reboot' of the 007 franchise...I have been following the fascinating career of Daniel Craig for some time now; from his brief appearance as a male accessory for Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft, to the more recent LAYER CAKE, which even contains a scene that seemed to be an impromptu screen test for the Bond role.Knowing what Craig's capacities were prior to his selection for CASINO ROYALE, I was looking forward to seeing what he would do with this iconic role, unlike the naysayers and knit-picking traditionalists who decried every aspect of his selection, from Craig's hair-coloring and height to the size of his ears and head (???). Now having seen the resulting product, I hope this will shut the lot of them up for good, (though I know that wish is impossible to have granted.)So what we have here is a Bond as rough-hewn, hard and nearly as blank as a block of granite. He's not even near as finished as the super-spy we recognize him from past exploits, but awaiting the physical and emotional experiences that will sculpt and mold his future persona as perfectly as the hard body that Craig obviously spent a lot of time working on prior to snagging the part. One of his 'sculptors', to his good fortune (and ours) is his Service boss, 'M', played here again by Dame Judi Dench. A lot has been made of their relationship in CASINO, with 'M' scolding and bringing him to heel as if he were a naughty schoolboy who just happened to have a license to kill and she was the stern headmistress. It's pretty obvious that the complainants are not paying attention. It's a new day, a new Bond and a new beginning, so for her to address him as if she'd known him for years would be completely anachronistic to the entire scenario.The stage is set in the pulse-pounding black-and-white opening, when Bond makes the two kills required to attain his 'OO' status. He's young to the game, cocky and impetuous, but definitely not 'green'. He's a budding virtuoso of violence...a death-dealer-in-training who still doesn't recognize how dangerous it is to enjoy your work a little too much. The days when he delivers the 'coup de grace' to an unlucky assailant with a quick quip and a quaff of a perfectly shaken martini have not yet arrived. And it's the events that unfold here that will set him on the path.The Purvis/Wade script (with an able assist from Paul Haggis) doesn't skimp on the action sequences during his development, however. The scenes where he tracks down terrorist quarry in Uganda are as heart-stopping as anything that's been done before, and it's a testament to his conditioning, quick wits and fortitude that Bond can even keep up with the 'parkour'-prone criminal Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan). Where CASINO excels, however, is showing the duality that not surprisingly existed in Bond's personality at the very beginning of his exploits. Even as he romances the wife of one of the main villain's flunkies because he considers 'dating' married women to be less complicated, his capacity for vulnerability and compassion are revealed as he develops a doomed romance with the ravishing Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), a government operative sent to bankroll James in a high-stakes poker bout in Montenegro, where the villain of the piece, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) is trying to raise money for terrorist-bound capital.Although she's also there to keep an eye on the unpredictable agent, and she is very much his intellectual and sexual equal, keeping James reigned in is a bigger job that Vesper expected to handle. Especially when romantic sparks begin to fly, and the fans are flamed further - as they are in a pivotal scene in a shower after a particularly brutal fight sequence, when James consoles his traumatized chaperone, who has never been exposed to the baser aspects of her chosen profession.This radical shift from rapscallion to romantic has not been explored since ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and Craig handles it beautifully. He has no problem making his infatuation believable, or the inevitable heartbreak when the affair takes a classically tragic turn (as must any romantically-tinged relationship Bond has.)Fortunately he's backed by a cast that mostly rises to his level. Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre is creepily charismatic without being ridiculously megalomaniacal, in the tradition of most Bond baddies, (mercilessly spoofed by Mike Myers in the AUSTIN POWERS films), and only goes just looney enough in the proper setting...during a sadomasochistic torture sequence lifted faithfully from the original novel. Renowned Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini is perfectly placed in his role as Bond's oily contact at the Montenegro casino where much of the action takes place, and Jeffrey Wright makes a brief but very meaningful appearance as Bond's friend at the CIA, Felix Leiter.Director Martin Campbell hasn't been part of the franchise since GOLDENEYE, but with the handsome job he does here mounting the rebirth of Fleming's iconic character, here's hoping he'll be back to helm subsequent entries into the 'new' series.Though the running time could've been trimmed back a bit (perhaps during the poker sequences), this is one Bond picture that definitely soars, possibly over most of the ones before it.Welcome back, James. We've missed you terribly.",9,0,2,27 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Analog Man In A Digital World...
","It wouldn't be stretching it to say that the first DIE HARD installment has been hailed far and wide as one of the best action-thriller films ever made, having garnered a following of rabid fans worldwide and rightfully so. Few heroes have ever been as resourceful and resilient, yet reluctant and vulnerable as John McClane and Bruce Willis has worked overtime to develop the character beautifully over the span of twenty-something years. Sadly, I can't say the same for the series itself. DH2 was still pretty good, but DH3 (DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE) left me feeling curiously unmoved, in spite of the potentially promising teaming of Willis with Samuel L. 'Action' Jackson, and the sneer-rich reliability of Jeremy Irons as the necessary 'big baddie'.So how does LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD stack up to its predecessors? Well, I was so convinced that the fourth installment would be an absolute mess, that I didn't even bother with it until it hit DVD, so I could at least see the 'Unrated' version as it was intended to be shown. I was not as turned off at the news about the casting, unlike other fans were: Tim Olyphant can do evil pretty convincingly, and I happen to be a fan of Justin Long's back from GALAXY QUEST and JEEPERS CREEPERS.What didn't have me jumping for joy was the fact that Len (UNDERWORLD) Wiseman was directing. Though both films in that series looked and sounded impeccable, they also played like what I imagine XBOX 360 games must look like, and left me just as cold as DH3 did. I was not optimistic to say the least.It sure is nice to get surprised! Wiseman takes a few pages from the John McTiernan playbook and keeps the action sequences taut and brutal, without resorting to rapid-fire MTV-type cutting, which is a welcome relief. As McClane, Bruce Willis at 50-plus seems to cut an even more impressive, world-weary and cynical figure, showing off his physical prowess in some unbelievable stunts that would wear out guys half his age. It's also nice to see him given a situation that's more of a challenge than ever before, as he is tasked with taking down a group of domestic cyberterrorists led by Olyphant, who are determined to bring down the entire electronic infrastructure of the United States.",8,0,2,12 December 2007
The Sixth Sense," Whatever You Do, Don't Blame It On The 'Night'...
","So you wanna know who's responsible for the disgusting glut of weak-ass, PG-13-rated bundles of porcine fecal matter trying to pass themselves off as 'horror movies?' Well, folks, just blame M. Night Shyamalan.No, let me take that back...Let's not blame 'Night', but the sorry excuses for writers, producers and directors who called themselves attempting to surpass the brilliance of Shyamalan's best movie so far...THE SIXTH SENSE.With a smooth effortlessness that's just about as terrifying as the movie itself, Shyamalan brings us the damn-near perfect story of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis in a role that shattered everyone's prejudices about him as an actor), a child psychologist who is shot by one of his former patients (an almost unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg), who then commits suicide. Sometime after this ordeal, feeling that he failed his late charge, Malcolm attempts to find redemption by helping out a distressed young boy named Cole Sear, (Haley Joel Osment's career-making performance). who can 'see' dead people and communicate with them.At no time are you ever unaware of how much you care for these characters, and how extreme the situation is for them, which makes the shocks and scares twice as intense as any you could ever find in a PG-13-rated flick before, (except maybe for POLTERGEIST.) Plus there are fantastic performances all the way round by Willis and Osment, backed up by great turns by Toni Collette (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Cole's tough- but-tender mom) and Olivia Williams as Malcolm's former fiancée.Even after multiple viewings, the storytelling skill that Shyamalan has is faultless, and still leaves you scratching your head as to how you could've missed the clues that lead to one of the most spellbinding, jaw-dropping endings to come along in many moons. Some people might figure it out in the first five minutes, but I will confess - Night so thoroughly pulled me into his world, that I wasn't one of them.SENSE was both a blessing and a curse to Shyamalan, since newly-won fans now expected ALL of his movies to have that tricky 'twist' ending to stun and surprise them. Because of that, the quality of the movies that followed SENSE was inconsistent to say the least. People still debate about the merits of UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS, or even if THE VILLAGE should've been made at all.Personally, I like everything he's done since, flaws and all. But as far as his career is concerned, THE SIXTH SENSE is like his 'CITIZEN KANE,' and considering the genre, is every bit as monumentally good as Orson Welles' towering achievement.THE SIXTH SENSE is without a doubt a 'must-have' for your DVD library.",9,0,0,4 December 2008
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of the true originals...
","For a horror film to achieve legendary status, it must offer its audience something truly original. It must have the ability to elicit its shocks and scares in a way that its target audience can identify with, without boring them to tears or insulting their intelligence. It must present protagonists we can empathize with and root for, and an antagonist that presents a threat that can represent something that we all fear, first and foremost, death in all its guises.HALLOWEEN managed this somewhat, but John Carpenter's crowning achievement owes as much to Hitchcock and the 'giallo' stylings of Dario Argento, as it does to Carpenter's talent for introducing tried and true conventions in a way that audiences had never seen them presented before.FRIDAY THE 13TH was actually no different and no better than most of Herschell Gordon Lewis splatterfests, or any of the infamous drive-in gross-outs that held sway all through the '60's and early '70's. What set it apart were the vast technical improvements over those earlier films, plus the unmistakable ability of master makeup artist Tom Savini to take cinematic gore to newer, more shocking and more repulsive levels. Which, bottom line, is about all that FRIDAY had going for it.Leave it to the writer/co-producer/director of what truly WAS the granddaddy of the slasher genre, the almost unwatchable LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, to come up with one of the last, truly terrifying monsters of the horror canon.
The moment we close our eyes and enter our own subconscious minds, traversing the lands of our private, individual dreamscapes, is the moment we become the most vulnerable. Even more exposed than our naked flesh, our open minds are subsceptible to suggestion, to outer and inner stimuli, to the light and dark sides of our psyches that otherwise we would never have a chance to explore...or dare to.So what would happen if we introduced at this point, a creature who could take all the rules that bind the id, the ego and the superego, and slash the rulebook to bits? Someone who could wreak havoc at will the moment you fall asleep, free to torture, to maim, to murder you and your friends in your sleep, and not just make it SEEM real, but bring it all into the realm of waking, bleeding, screaming reality?That is the brilliance and the power of the original NIGHTMARE, eons before Fred Krueger became a razor-fingered Rodney Dangerfield, tossing off goofy quips while dispatching trendy teen actors ranging from Robert Rusler, to Jennifer Rubin, and even occasionally, the likes of Zsa Zsa Gabor. This was like an ABC Afterschool Special whose script somehow found its way into the word processor of Clive Barker, took a left turn into THE TWILIGHT ZONE and never looked back.Compared to the havoc that today's directors can now wreck with CGI, it may seem crude by today's 'Matrix'-style standards. Some of the dialogue is clunky, and there are a few glaring gaps in continuity, but in the casting, the acting, the direction, the special effects and the music (a truly spine-chilling score by genre specialist Charles Bernstein), very few movies of its decade could measure up. It raised the bar for overall ability to scare the squirts out of you, and I can't recall the last time a film frightened me as much as my first ELM STREET viewing did.[And that definitely includes THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which, IMHO, is a really pale imitation of LAST HOUSE. Get yourself the unrated copy of this horror-in-the-deep-woods gem, turn out the lights, sit back and let it enfold you. Afterwards, if you can still speak, you tell me if you think BLAIR WITCH is still the scariest movie you've ever seen. Anyone who has seen the complete version wouldn't have been surprised at all, that the same director came up with NIGHTMARE and the SCREAM movies. I certainly wasn't.]",Null,0,0,17 November 2000
Fantastic Four," 'Lightening' Things Up...Literally
","Okay, okay, enough already with the bellyaching about how this movie isn't falling in line with the 'established model' these days. Yes, BATMAN BEGINS is the best case of having a Phoenix rising from the ashes, after the debacle that was BATMAN AND ROBIN. But between this and the last X-MEN, (not to mention SPIDERMAN 2,) there's just been a bit too much 'extra angst, please, hold the comedy.' With all this brooding darkness clouding up the story lines, it was about high time for a little levity, and besides, FANTASTIC FOUR was the least dreary of the superhero properties Marvel launched to start with.There are pacing problems, but I believe it has more to do with the attention span of the demographic the producers were aiming for--that infamous '13-to-17' year old enclave of teeners and tweeners. You know...screw the story and character development crap; let's start 'blowin' stuff up REEEEEL GOOOOOD!' Well, sorry, kiddies, but every superhero saga must have a backstory that has to be set up, and fortunately 'F4' takes just enough time to do so before the CGI kicks in.With that said, on to the performances. As nice as it would've been to have stars that were just a little more memorable in the lead roles, (apparently George Clooney was busy and Anna Paquin was already snatched up for X-MEN 3), Ioan Gruffud and Jessica Alba do serviceable jobs as Reed Richards and Sue Storm. And of course, in Jessica's case, as the old saying goes, nobody in the audience who is male will be looking at her 'acting skills.' (Which is funny, since Sue spends a good part of the movie invisible.) Nope, when it comes to personality,the two actors kicking it into overdrive would be Chris Evans as Johnny Storm, aka 'The Human Torch' and THE SHIELD's figurehead Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/'THE THING.' These guys know they're in a comic book superhero movie, and that their characters need to be larger than life, and therefore pull out all the stops with pretty admirable results. Chiklis provides the pathos as the big granite guy with the broken marshmallow heart, while Evans heats up his A&F looks and smartass charm to about the same temperature as his character's buff bod when he 'flames on.' Not to mention it will give the female section of the gallery something to squeal over, (and yes, a few males as well!)If there is a weak link at all in the casting, it would unfortunately be the villain, Victor Von Doom, as portrayed by NIP/TUCK's handsome medical lothario Julian McMahon.Pre-transformation, he doesn't seem to be playing his character so much as he is riffing on the good/bad doc from his series. Which is okay, since the personalities that comprise the two roles are not that different. But once the mask goes on, you need a villain to be equally as charismatic as the heroes, if not more so, and all he managed to do was help me realize where the inspiration came from for Peter Wyngarde's Klytus make-up, in the FLASH GORDON remake from the Eighties. (Now for a mess of a movie, THERE was a baddie with a dash of panache!)Well, at least Mark Frost and Michael France's screenplay manages not to take TOO many liberties with the original story, and director Tim Story keeps things brisk, if he doesn't manage to best or even equal the likes of predecessors like Christopher Nolan, Sam Raimi or Bryan Singer.It's a fast-moving, fitfully funny and frenetic summer trifle, fueled with the usual popcorn paradigm in mind. As long as you go in expecting little more than an evening's worth of pleasant entertainment, you'll be fine. For brooding heroes bogged down with enough psychological baggage to give Freud the vapors, have another go at BATMAN BEGINS.",8,0,2,8 August 2005
Beetlejuice," There Goes The Neighborhood...
","The Maitlands and The Dietzes: two families who have nothing in common except the house they both live in. So what's the twist? Well, actually...the Dietzes are a family you'd probably WANT to see dead. The Maitlands? They already are.Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) and her husband, Adam (Alec Baldwin), have just moved into a sweet little country house, when the unthinkable happens...thanks to a freak car accident, the whole line about 'till Death do us part' has actually taken on a whole new meaning for them. But they've been parted from life, not from each other. And if you're thinking that death is all that different from the life they just left behind, think again. The Afterlife can be just as fraught with complications and peril, not the least of which finds the poor couple stranded in an 'alternative universe'-version of their house.Enter the Dietzes. Pretentious, social-status fixated richies Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and Delia (Catherine O'Hara) and their Goth-obsessed daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder), who proceed to turn the Maitlands' quaint little cottage into an avant-garde nightmare that only Hieronymus Bosch - or Salvador Dali - could love. What are two frustrated, spatially-stranded spooks to do? There's actually a sort of 'Health and Haunted Services' system in the Great Beyond that provides assistance in the form of caseworkers (who are about as helpful in death as they are in life), and Adam and Barbara's 'help' comes in the form of the cynical and cancerous Juno, (the great Sylvia Sidney), who goes completely by the book...but does tip the deceased darlings off to one dangerously unpredictable possibility for a resolution of their problem.His name, as you know by now, is Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) - or as more commonly known - 'Beetlejuice.' He's a caseworker turned 'independent contractor', which means he's bad news for the Maitlands, worse news for the Dietzes, and the best thing to happen to horror-comedies since three guys named Venkman, Spengler and Stanz. Say his name three times, and let the mirthful mayhem begin!Audiences couldn't get enough of Tim Burton's uniquely twisted perspective on the world after his first major movie, PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE exploded onto movie screens, and no one knew what to expect for his follow-up. Good thing, too, because there was no way to anticipate or explain this screwy and satisfying story of ghosts being haunted by a living family more scary than they are, and the outrageous entity out to fleece them both for his own purposes, (not the least of which is to get a little cuddle time in with the languishingly lovely Lydia.)How a literal army of writers managed to put together a script this good is beyond me, but after multiple viewings, this is still Number One for the title of Funniest Frightfest around.Burton was laying the groundwork for his revolving company of players with BEETLEJUICE as well. Besides Jeffrey Jones as the nerd-alert of a husband, there's Glenn Shadix as the fey Otho, Delia's co-designer/co-conspirator in making over the Maitlands' house and the 'exorcism' that follows, and Ryder, of course, in her breakout role which would be followed by her turn in HEATHERS, guaranteeing her status as the Eighties' 'It ' girl.And besides the trademark hallucinogenic visuals and blackly funny sense of humor, there was that casting. Bringing Davis, Baldwin and the manic Keaton together was a masterstroke of both luck and genius, and who else could take Sylvia Sidney, Robert Goulet and DICK CAVETT, put them in the same movie and actually make them 'cool?' It certainly wouldn't be the last time he would make that feat happen, but the timing and the end result would arguably never be more perfect.BEETLEJUICE is a must-have for any movie library, whether you collect comedy OR horror. It can exist easily in both worlds...kind of like the Maitlands and the Dietzes.",9,2,4,5 December 2008
