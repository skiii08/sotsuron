The Mask," My Favorite Jim Carrey Movie of All Time
","Jim Carrey is a really funny comedian, and this is my favorite movie that he stars in. The Mask is a classic comedy and for 25 years old, it still looks really good to this very day.The movie is about an average guy, Stanley Ipkiss (played by Jim Carrey) and he is living a mediocre life as a banker and being swept under the rug. One night, he comes across a legendary mask that, when he puts on, turns him into a full blown crazy and wacky guy. Stanley uses these powers to hit on a hot chick, Tina (played by Cameron Diaz) and to stop this mob group from robbing and later wanting to kill Tina.Everything about this movie was fantastic. The dialogue and quotes from Carrey were funny and clever, the special effects were impressive for 1994, and pacing was fast and great.Also, this is Cameron Diaz's first movie, and I gotta say, she did a wonderful job as playing the love interest. Her character was likable, sweet, and there was great chemistry with her and Carrey on screen.Overall, I love The Mask. It's Jim Carrey at his best because he gets to have superpowers and be funnier than ever.This movie is WAY WAY better than that terrible sequel known as 'Son of the Mask' which is one of the worst sequels ever made.",10,4,4,16 December 2019
John Wick," A Really Awesome Action Flick
","John Wick is one of Keanu Reeves' best movies. It has tons of high-scaled action, one heck of a plot, and runs in a fast and steady pace for 100 minutes.Thi movie is about a man, John Wick (played by Reeves), who retired from being an assassin after the death of his wife. A savage mobster and his thugs then steal Wick's priceless car and kill his puppy. So now, it's time for Wick to seek vengeance and kill the people that screwed him over.I would say this is also a perfect example of a revenge flick. Similar to Kill Bill, the protagonist must get back at the person for killing something of theirs.'John Wick' has a lot of great action scenes. It has enough to satisfy an audience to where they are speechless.The acting is great. Keanu had one hell of a performance in this and he knew what he had to do in order for this movie to be action packed. All the other cast members did a really good job as well.The one thing I do not like about this film is when the puppy dies. That scene was so hard to watch and makes you want to cry because you feel bad for him. But thankfully, Wick manages to get back at the bad guys for doing that.All in all, John Wick is outstanding, and is one of the best movies of 2014. Highly recommend it.It is my 3rd favorite movie of 2014 after 'Guardians of the Galaxy', and 'Interstellar'.",9,0,1,16 December 2019
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Really Great Movie Based On One of My All Time Favorite Shows
","I absolutely love 'South Park'. It is tied with 'Kim Possible' as my favorite Cartoon Series of all time, and I feel it's still very watchable to this day. Seasons 1-18 are awesome, 19 and 20 have a huge chunk of really good episodes, and since Season 21, there has been a few episodes that I didn't think were that funny, but there is still some really good stuff for the most part.'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut' is a movie that I really like A lot.It's about Stan, Eric, Kyle, and Kenny going to see a movie that is from Canada called 'Terrence and Phillip: Asses of Fire' (Which is Rated R). But after they see the movie they start to use all these sware words at school and the parents get so mad that Kyle's Mom wants to start a war with Canada. It's up to all the kids in South Park to save Terrence and Phillip from being killed in the war.I thought the story was really good, the animation is amazing even for a movie that came out in 1999, the voice acting is great, and the humor in this movie is really funny. I will say Eric Cartman is one of my favorite cartoon characters ever. Yes, he can be stupid and immature sometimes, but for the most part he is really funny.Overall, I love 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut'. I would say it is just as awesome as the show.It is my 2nd favorite movie of 1999 (1st being 'Fight Club'), my 2nd favorite animated movie of all time (1st being 'Beauty and the Beast') and it is one of my favorite movies based off a TV Series.",10,0,0,16 December 2019
Yes Man," A Very Funny Movie!
","Yes Man is the last Jim Carrey movie that I feel was really funny. This was the last one that had a great plot to make it an entertaining movie.Carrey plays a man name Carl, who works at a bank and is having trouble saying yes to a lot of things and people. He then joins a seminar that makes him say yes a lot, and he feels this has changed his life. He also meets a beautiful woman, Allison (played by Zooey Deschanel) and they form a relationship. However, later on, things take a turn for the worst as Carl realizes saying yes to particular things get him into trouble.The film's plot (like a lot of people say) is kind of similar to Liar Liar. Liar Liar deals with a guy having trouble being honest and that changes through a son's birthday wish, while this deals with a guy having trouble saying yes and that changes through a seminar. Although the plot is similar and not too original, I still really enjoyed this film.Jim Carrey manages to be funny and had a great performance with Zooey Deschanel, and the pacing for this movie was pretty fast. It wasn't too boring at all.If the plot would of been a little bit more original, than this film would have been a lot better. But, I will say, Yes Man is a great Jim Carrey film to watch for very good laughs and to see Carrey one last time be truly funny and truly rememberable.This is one of my favorite comedy movies of 2008 and it's my 3rd favorite Jim Carrey of all time. (1st being 'The Mask' and 2nd being 'Liar Liar')",9,0,1,16 December 2019
Full Metal Jacket," My 2nd Favorite War Movie of All Time
","Full Metal Jacket is my favorite Stanley Kubrick movie of all time, and it's my 2nd favorite war movie of all time.This movie is about Private 'Joker' Davis (played by Matthew Modine) who is going through basic training and is suffering through insults from his foul mouthed drill sarge, Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and helps a guy named Private 'Pyle' Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) get through basic training. Pyle takes a pretty bad detour, and Joker is graduating to the Marine Corps and is sent to Vietnam, where he joins the Battle of Hu√©.Full Metal Jacket was a masterpiece and a great war film. It had an awesome story, the acting was fantastic, the war elements were amazing, and it ran in a fast pace.R. Lee Ermey, did a great job in this movie. Not only does he get to be humorous, but he does a great job at playing a legit drill sergeant. Vincent D'Onofrio was pretty good at playing Private Pyle, as he turned psycho later on, and Modine was great as the lead character.The war elements were also phenomenal. With all the gun action, explosions, and violence, they really did a solid job giving this film some good war spirit.Over all, I love Full Metal Jacket and is definitely the 2nd best war movie I have ever seen right next to 'Saving Private Ryan.I give this movie a perfect 10 out of 10 and I highly recommend this movie if you haven't seen it.",10,0,0,16 December 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," My Least Favorite of the Series but Still Really Good
","John Wick. One of the best action movies of the 2010's. It was fast paced, had great action scenes, and is definitely one of Keanu's best movies.John Wick: Chapter 2 may not be as great as the first movie was, but it's still a really great sequel. This time around, an Italian gangster, named Santino D'Antonio, shows up to tell John Wick to travel to Rome to assassinate Santino's sister, Gianna, who is on the top of the list of Italian crime. Wick does what he can in his power to take her out and save Italy.The story for this one wasn't revengeful like the first, but it still has some great action, Keanu did a great job once again, and it ran in a smooth pace for 2 hours.I do like how they have the setting of this film in Italy. It makes it more complex and bigger than the previous film's setting.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a great sequel and it is one of the best sequels of 2017 along with 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Thor: Ragnorak' and 'War For the Planet of the Apes'.",9,0,0,16 December 2019
