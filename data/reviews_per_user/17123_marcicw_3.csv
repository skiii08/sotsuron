The Ring," Must See Horror Movie
",This movie is what a horror movie should be! Great suspense & a great plot. Could not have been done better & the cast was right on with their performances! Naomi Watts is HOT! This was the movie of 2002! And was up against another great movie in Ghost Ship.,10,1,1,6 July 2003
The Others," What a horror movie should be!
","This is what a horror movie should be! Not a bloody, gory, nude fest. Had suspense, made you think, & supplied some great swerves that you weren't expecting. The biggest & best swerve saved for the end. I don't see there being a sequel but this was the movie of 2001!",10,1,2,6 July 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good movie but a let down
","T3 was a good movie don't get me wrong. However, T1 & T2 were such great movies it had a hard act to follow. T3 had great action at the beginning & the car chase was excellent but it just didn't live up to the first two. Had it been a stand alone movie, I would have been impressed but it just didn't reach the heights of T1 & T2. Ah-nuld is still good though!",Null,0,0,6 July 2003
