Vertigo," pure quality
","Hitchcock's best film ??? I think yes... 'Vertigo' is the best thriller I've ever seen, it has great performances, an amazing plot, and what can I say about the direction of the film? it's masterful. I watched this movie after watching a music video called 'Last Cup Of Sorrow' form the band Faith No More, and after  I knew that the plot was a rip-off of this movie, I watched it and now it's one of my favorite movies of all time.All I can say is that if you haven't seen 'Vertigo' what are you waiting for??? Go now and rent it, no no, buy it! it's a great film in all aspects.",Null,2,4,12 November 2001
Memento," a round trip journey in time
","'MEMENTO' had to win the best screenplay written directly for the screen in this year's Academy Awards. This is the kind of movie that will make you think, it will keep you wondering, but for sure,  it will not bore you -unless you don't take it seriously-. The characters of the movie are developed greatly, and the actors who portray them are perfect. The direction of the movie is great too, but if you blink maybe you'll get lost in some parts. 'MEMENTO' is a flawless movie, it's perfect in all senses, it's watchable for thriller and mystery fans. A MUST SEE!!!!!!! 10/10",Null,0,1,29 March 2002
Léon: The Professional," EXCELLENT FILM!
","Excellent is the word that better describes this movie.Jean Reno delivers an amazing performance, he's a Spanish-French actor,  in this movie he's an Italian-American 'professional'. And this was Natalie Portman's debut in a movie, which is a fortunate debut, she convinces as Mathilda, a young girl that lives situations that not even a grown up could resist. I was amazed by her performance, I think that this is the best performance by a young actress in an action movie.  The couple formed by Reno and Portman is brilliant, both actors show how to impress and act at the same time. SO, the 2 main characters of the movie are great. And a key element for this movie is Gary Oldman, he's -great- performance is convincing, he's the cold blood villain with no feelings. I think that Gary Oldman is role model for every action movie villain. The plot is well threatened through the film, and the action scenes are amazing, what else can you ask in an action film? Well 'Léon' has everything...This is a must-see movie , 'Léon' is a great action (drama?) movie that will keep you in your seat until the shocking end. This is one of my favorite movies of all time...Two Thumbs Up!!!",Null,0,1,11 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," fellowship of the NERDS
","I know I may be hated by thousands of IMDB fans, but... whatever!. This movie is only for the lovers of sci-fi or fans of the Tolkien book. LOTR has great special effects, and a good original music score, but that's it!! There's no good acting, I can't believe Ian Mc Kellen got nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  This film is almost dedicated for nerds, those who think that this is the best movie of the year, or even worse,  the best movie of all time!!!! Don't get me wrong, this movie is entertaining, but it's not the 8th wonder of the world.
---Minor SPOILER--- The ending! what about it??? It's like a soap opera's Friday episode it lets you guessing what will happen on the next episode,... the difference is that in a soap opera you know what will happen on Monday, and in this movie, you'll know it until late 2002!.",Null,0,0,28 March 2002
Ice Age," if you mix 'Shrek' and 'Monsters Inc.' you get ICE AGE
","But it's very original in it's way! This movie is highly recommended for all audiences (even grown-ups will enjoy it). It has lots of laughs, emotional moments, and an interesting plot.  All I can say is : Don't miss this one, go to the movies now!",Null,0,0,30 March 2002
Bring It On," she's Torrance!
","I have to admit, I only watched this movie because Kirsten Dunst appeared on it. Kirsten is great in this film, she's fun, she's pretty, she's a princess!. After watching it, I realized that I enjoyed the movie. It's a typical teen film, but it sure has it's fun moments.Watch 'Bring It On' ONLY if you are in a good mood... or if you are a Kirsten Dunst fan.",Null,0,0,13 January 2002
Halloween," BEST HORROR FILM OF ALL TIMES?
","After watching 'HALLOWEEN' on a rainy night my life changed. I was so scared because I was so into the movie that I felt that anytime Michael Myers could enter in my room. That was long time ago, I had 12. The superb direction is by none other than John Carpenter. 'HALLOWEEN' is the father of all the 80's teen - slasher films, and it influences the actual horror films, that's something that none other movie has done for the horror genre. Seems that horror's glory days are gone, and horror fans quench their thirst of terror with lame horror films (SCREAM ?). Where's that feeling of fear when the killer of the movie  appears on scene? There aren't even haunting music themes for actual horror movies.I hope that horror will emerge in 2002. Maybe horror will return, but not in it's full glory, as it's shown in 'HALLOWEEN'.",8,0,0,4 January 2002
