Casablanca," Exactly the classic it's made out to be, even though it wasn't made to be
","It's hard to believe that 'Casablanca' (1942) wasn't expected to be the classic that it's considered now. It's about loving and losing, rising above and sacrificing for the greater good, and becoming a better person. At the time of its release, people everywhere were reeling from the injustice that's captured in the film, which fueled its advancement. All films renouncing Nazi terrorism tend to be highly respected, but this one is especially so. The music, both diegetic and nondiegetic, is beautiful and touching. The lighting is soft and fitting, and all of the characters who should be are rounded out well. Ingrid Bergman is unbelievably gorgeous, which makes it a little hard to concentrate on the witty, fast-paced dialogue she's involved in, but it's worth it. Humphrey Bogart portrays his supposedly cynical lead character perfectly. There are so many factors that make this the classic it is, and I don't think I could put my finger on all of them.Overall, 'Casablanca' is exactly what you would expect a film this reputable to be: beautiful and inspirational.",9,1,2,9 May 2014
Chinatown," Dark, gripping, and enthralling
","It's very odd, but I get the impression that Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown' (1974) is one of the best private-eye dramas ever made, and I've only seen a few in my life. That's the kind of imprint this film leaves. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are perfect in their roles as a cynical private detective and a mysterious and beautiful femme fatale, respectively (of course). I thought the lighting was suiting, the camera-work was appropriate, but not over the top. The score wasn't unusual, so it wasn't all that important, but who cares? It's a dramatic film, and a predictable dramatic score is fitting. The actual music involved is jazzy and well-placed. The plot is gripping and riveting; so seeing this film is definitely an interesting way to spend an evening.Overall, an enthralling film that couldn't possible bore anyone, and a fun dramatic movie to watch if you like that sort of plot. Even if you're iffy about the very dark quality of it, give it a chance. It's an experience you shouldn't miss either way.",9,1,2,9 May 2014
Gone with the Wind," A must-see
","Gone with the Wind (1939, George Cusak, Victor Fleming, Sam Wood) is a perfect adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's famous novel of the same name. Scarlett and Rhett's twisted romance rising and falling takes place in the heart of a war where any and every win from either side is a Pyrrhic victory, and the groundbreaking use of color was just in time to improve an already beautiful film. I can only assume that without color, this film would be lessened, but still a wonderful depiction of what Mitchell created. This alluring and headstrong woman represents the sheer will of the Southern states in the tumultuous Civil War, and her stubbornness, like the South's, leads to her ultimate failure in achieving happiness. The shots, specifically the extremely wide ones such as the scene where Scarlett is picking her way through the crowd of bodies that embody the dying of the old South, are very interesting to look for. The lighting is normally very bright, and in the scene where Rhett is assisting Scarlett, Melanie, her baby, and Prissy to flee the burning Atlanta, it is so bright and warm that it truly does look like their little Southern world is ablaze. The use of shadows and silhouettes is also very interesting. Several shots in scenes set at Tara, Scarlett's childhood home, often use wide shots that do not completely articulate the in-shot characters' features. Instead, they capture their silhouettes. As for design and costuming, the steady decline in the elegance of living conditions and clothing perfectly exemplifies the fall of class and grace at that time. In my opinion, Gone with the Wind is an absolute must-see. However, I highly recommend reading the book first, as it makes the photography of the film easier to appreciate.",9,1,2,12 March 2014
Annie Hall," You simply have to see it
","'Annie Hall' (1977) is one of those films you just can't go through life without seeing. It's very important for its aspect of the romantic comedy genre, but also for its cinematic importance. Cinematically, 'Annie Hall' marks a turning point in Woody Allen's career and his influence on the development of film, which includes the use of cinematic techniques such as a split screen to show differences in scene and characters rather than people talking on the phone, a non- linear narrative, and breaking the fourth wall by speaking directly to the camera. The continual allusions to psychoanalytic study are emphasized with these plainly neurotic techniques. Woody Allen set a trend with the last of those, for which he became famous, and 'Annie Hall' is an epitome of who he is and what he means to the history of cinema. In this film, Woody Allen plays an insecure, pessimistic, paranoid comedian and Diane Keaton plays the titular self-conscious singer Annie Hall. Their unconventional romance is shown in flashbacks, such as when they meet during the well-known and borderline painfully awkward meet- cute where Diane Keaton's character says the famous line 'la-dee-da, la- dee-da'. 'Annie Hall' plays jump-rope with the line between charming and uncomfortable. This is a romantic comedy where instead of two love interests being brought together, they grow apart and don't end up together. It's awkward, neurotic, and funny, and although its ending may not be a common staple of romantic comedies, it is a frank observation of realistic romance.",9,0,0,8 May 2014
The Graduate," Seriously, just watch the movie. Right now. Go.
","Mike Nichols's 'The Graduate' (1967) is easily one of my favorite films. It's a classic for a reason. Nichols perfectly summarizes both the rebellion of the younger generation, known as 'the generation gap' that erupted in the 1960s, and the troublesome crisis that everyone goes through at some point in their life when they realize they have no idea what they want from it. The photography and cinematography of it is incredible. Every shot has meaning, every shot is innovative, and every shot adds to how amazing this film is. It's built on how artistic and creative the physical foundation of it is, and the story goes from there.'The Graduate' would be nothing without its lead character, Benjamin Braddock, and his actor, Dustin Hoffman. I've heard that Hoffman's a method actor through and through, and this performance proves it. He fits the role perfectly. Benjamin, a recent college graduate who reluctantly goes to live with his goofy parents due to having nowhere else to go, is awkward, lost, confused, and most importantly, lacks motivation. His character stands for what everyone feels at times, and represents that part of us, but when he overcomes his life-induced faults and recovers the motivation to move forward with his life, it's truly inspiring. Hoffman portrays his character amazingly.Simon and Garfunkel's music is perfect for this film. It emphasizes both how achingly forlorn it can be at times, and how hopeful and beautiful it is.'The Graduate' is awkward, realistic, and witty. While watching it with several other people I discovered that for some, like me, it's hilarious, because of my dry sense of humor, but for others it's simply more of a drama. I see it as a romantic comedy that is at times painfully sincere, and laughed my way through it.The most memorable part for me was the very last scene where Benjamin and his unfortunately troublesome choice of a love interest are sitting in the back of a bus, having just fled from a wedding, romantic-movie-style, and the uncomfortable moment that no romantic comedy wants to show comes: the inevitable 'what now?'. It's a paradigm of how awkward and real the film is.",10,2,2,9 May 2014
