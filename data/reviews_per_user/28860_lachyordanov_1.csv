","That movie was a total waste of time. It had nothing to do with the original idea of Stephen King's novel 'It'. Basically the new movie 'It' represents just a clown that just appears every 27 years to kill kids, but not once throughout the movie was it mentioned why was IT doing it or what IT actually is. Just like the 1990 version - a lot of scenes were missing, but this time the percentage of missing scenes was like 95%. That movie looks like a poor representation of the 1990 movie, written by someone, who has never read the book.",1,3,5,31 October 2017
