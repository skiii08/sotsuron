The Incredible Hulk," Good Entertainment Value
","The obvious element to this film are the impressive special effects, which are a distinct improvement if comparing to Ang Lee's Hulk. This was the major driver of the film along with a more consistent storyline that compliments the comic book version.However, with such a strong cast it had raised my expectations in terms of performance which were short lived. I believe Norton's performance was not suited to the role and personally felt it was not successfully delivered as Bruce Banner. No other actors really shined through either but I guess films such as these are not aiming to get best acting performance, but rather something related to the special effects.I would recommend this film for entertainment value as an action movie and not be too critical of the other elements (such as acting and script) as they are only just average.",6,1,3,24 June 2008
