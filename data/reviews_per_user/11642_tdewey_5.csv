Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great. With the best final reel of the series.
","While TPM will not, in the fullness of time, be considered the best Star Wars film (ESB still holds that lofty position) it is certainly a peer of ESB and ANH and, IMHO, better than RotJ. It has stunning visuals, excellant acting by its major and minor characters and has an entertaining plot. Its poor critical response is due I think to the fact that this is the first Star Wars film that assumes Star Wars knowledge by those watching it.  Some of the best non-effect scenes in the film (read anything with Ian McDiarmid) are lost on those who don't understand that we are watching Palpatine's ascent to power--and that he, not the much-licensed Darth Maul, is the real villain of the piece. I don't want to put in to many spoilers to my review but it has been a long times since I've seen anything as droll and understated as Palpatine's last comment to Anakin.On the whole the acting is excellant--this is the best ensemble ever in a Star Wars movie.  Liam Nesson matches Alec Guinness' standout performance in the original Star Wars and Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are both likable and exciting to see on screen. In smaller roles Pernilla August, Hugh Quarshie, and Brian Blessed all give wonderful performances. The scene-stealer award must go, though, to the already mentioned Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. His performance alone is worth the price of the show. If Mr. McDiarmid fails to at least get a Supporting Actor Oscar Nomination it will be a crime against great bad villains everywhere. Ray Park, Terence Stamp, Frank Oz and Samuel L. Jackson are all fine in what are basically cameo roles. I think I speak for the vast majority of the film audience in wishing for a few more moments of Mr. Park and a few more audio selections from Peter Serafinowicz (voice of D.M). A great secondary villain that we see too little of.This is not to say the film is perfect--I think Mr. Lucas miscalculated slightly by setting Anakin's age as 8/9 and not a more suitible 12/13. Jake Lloyd is in fine form when piloting a pod or ship and suitably stone faced while centerstage at the jedi council chambers but he can not (could any 8 or 9 year old?) make us believe that an emotional attachment could arise between an 8 yr old and a 14-year old. Natalie Portman tries her best to meet Mr. Lloyd halfway but for her too the premise will not work. At most her affection for young Ani comes accross as some form of misplaced maternal instinct. Indeed part of Ms. Portman's inability to make us believe a romantic attachment is that she plays her role (that of a young but smart and saavy Queen) so well. I personally found the much-maligned Jar-Jar Binks less irritating than I anticipated, but still irritating, thankfully he practically disappears during the second half of the movie.  One suspects that even George tired of his antics--Memo to George: Please limit Jar Jar to a cameo in the next film--or if you have to have a Gungan as a main character use the vastly amusing Boss Nass.The above quibbles aside, The Phantom Menace ranks among the best of its genre and deserves a solid overall 8. I gave it one extra point because, with the exception of Roger Ebert, none of the major critics appeared to review the movie for what it was, but rather what they though it should have been. Lastly I gave it a final extra point (bringing it to a magic 10) for that amazing last reel--arguably the best last reel of any of the Star Wars films to date.",6,0,1,20 May 1999
Memento," Interesting to watch once.
",I don't understand the gushing over this film. It's an interesting watch the first time around but it has zero replay value.Yes it's quite clever. But clever does not make the film one of the ten best of all time.,1,4,12,16 December 2001
Moulin Rouge!," The most daring, inventive, kinetic, sweet and fabulous film of 2001.
","Let me begin with a quick aside to a few of the other reviewers. Never, ever review a film that you haven't seen in its entirety. Doing so reveals an incredible contempt for the medium.Moulin Rouge is quite simply the best film to come out of a major Hollywood studio in quite some time it compares favorably to Fight Club (the movie), Rent (the musical) and One Hundred Years of Solitude (the book).Whether you like it will depend quite a lot on you. You can't just sit and watch Moulin Rouge like you would a simpler movie. You either accept the Universe Baz creates or you don't. I personally find Baz's world exhilarating and embraced it gladly.While the triumph of Moulin Rouge is ultimately the director's--he couldn't have gotten there without wonderful performances by his cast and company (and crew). The cast is exceptional and well chosen. Kidman shines as the courtesan Satine. Her voice is surprisingly warm especially in the Sparkling Diamonds and I'll Fly Away numbers. Ewan McGregor is (as others have mentioned) the real surprise--should he choose he could junk the Movie Star life for the Rock Star life.The supporting cast is, if anything, even better in their roles. Jim Broadbent is simply spectacular--and Oscar worthy--as Zindel. Roxburgh has the toughest role in the film (the villain Duke) and handles it expertly. Leguizamo's (Toulouse-Lautrec) lisp is somewhat off-putting--but apparently true to life. Regardless his energy wins you over by the end of the movie.After my first viewing my single strongest feeling was shock that such a movie made it through the studio process (Fight Club generated a similiar feeling--wasn't that a 20thCentury flick as well?). I can not recommend this movie enough--it is one for the ages. Don't wait for the video or DVD this movie demands to be seen (and seen again and again) in the theatre.",10,0,1,4 June 2001
The Good Shepherd," Terrible. Boring. Unbelievable.
","Some of the other comments cover much I want to say about this bloated awful mess of a movie from Mr. DeNiro. First the good -- the acting is more than decent from all the principals: Damon, Jolie, etc -- only the grown-up son of Damon's character is weak.The problem with the movie is the script -- how are we to believe that Damon's character is admired by Russia when he fails at everything. Let me repeat EVERYTHING. We are told time and again that 'Mother' -- the codename the Russians have given Damon's character is feared. Yet Damon's character falls for every ruse thrown at him -- this supposed counter intelligence mastermind is a moron. After a while it becomes laughable. You know that anything that can go wrong will.Just a mess. Avoid it if you can. I can't believe I wasted two+ hours of my life watching it. The worst move that the three principals DeNiro, Damon and Jolie have made.",1,6,11,11 September 2007
Shrek," Dreck.
","Bad animation, only okay (voice)acting and a so-so story does not a great movie make. I just can't fathom the response to this movie. Somehow Shrek has the reputation of being a great parody--it isn't. The great parodies (e.g. Blazing Saddles, South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut) rise above the material they are parodying--Shrek doesn't come close to equaling the Disney material it makes fun of.Monsters, Inc. ran circles around Shrek in all three categories--yet Shrek is the favorite to win the new animation Oscar. Ah well.",1,17,41,24 December 2001
