Lucky Number Slevin," Movie of the Year
","This movie was RIVETING! Absolutely Amazing! Not one time was I even slightly uninterested in what was happening on that screen. I loved the character development, the settings, the character's themselves were spectacular. This is an additional Great Career Role for Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley. And another Career Maker for Josh Hartnet and Lucy Lui. If you haven't seen this movie yet, PLEASE GO! It has just enough humor and romance for a great date movie, just enough action adventure for a guys night, enough fun and Josh Hartnet for a ladies night out. It's just a movie made for any and everyone over 17 that would love to appreciate a movie! My movie of the year...hell this is the best movie I have EVER seen, no questions asked.",10,2,9,22 April 2006
