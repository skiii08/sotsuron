Child 44," antirussian bullshit
","Unbelievable bullshit from the first seconds. The worst example of American propaganda. Kind of movie, when you don't to laugh or to cry watching it. Lots of clich√©s, grotesque and stupid characters, atmosphere of fear? 'evil empire'. I just can not believe that this kind of movie could be filmed in 21 century. What the hell? Seriously! There is nothing to review here. Just nothing. All these first-class actors are looking really strange in this kind of movie. Another round of cold war? I don't know. I have to write something that to reach review limit. It doesn't deserve ten lines of text. It doesn't deserve to be revieved at all.",1,8,20,3 November 2015
