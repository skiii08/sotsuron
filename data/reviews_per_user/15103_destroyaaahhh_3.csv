Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie fails on every level
","I rate this movie 1/10 because there is only one good thing : the music. My advice is to close your eyes, listen to the music and dream about a better movie. The plot makes no sense, the characters are undeveloped, the acting is uninspired to say the least (and with such great actors giving ALL terrible performances you know the problem are not the actors themselves but the director), the special effects are laughable and very dated by today's standards (not that they were any good back in '99), and overall this is a poorly conceived and badly executed....project, I guess. This thing is not even worthy of being called a 'movie' because a movie is supposed to have a story and some characters: this failed experiment has neither.I will not mention all the problems with the original trilogy because back in '99 I had never seen a Star Wars movie before (I totally missed it: it was all about Ninja Turtles when I was a kid) so I had NO expectations at all because I knew nothing of Star Wars. This was my first SW movie and when I walked out of the theater I was thinking 'So this is what all the fuss is about ?' , I was really unimpressed and kept on ignoring Star Wars for years until recently an old friend forced me to watch the original movies and well.... now I understand what all the fuss was about. Star Wars is awesome, and people were right to complain so much about how bad this movie is.My point is that even if you are not a Star Wars fan this movie will anger you with how stupid the plot is and how little effort was put into their work by every single person involved in this....thing. Were it not for the music it would get a zero.",1,1,4,10 September 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Worse than The Phantom Menace
","So this is a joke, right ? This is not a movie, it's an unfinished assembly cut at best. Special effects are clunky and look terribly fake, the plot makes no sense at all, the acting is uninspired, the action scenes are confusing and pointless and we have to witness the worse love story ever put to film. This 'movie' is just an excuse to showcase special effect that will be turned into toys to make money, it's basically a 2 hours long advertisement campaign for Star Wars merchandise, it's insulting. I could go on and on but there is no point : I would be putting more effort in my review than George Lucas did in this movie . This movie has no redeeming qualities, if I could I would give it a zero, so even less than The Phantom Menace. This is not a movie, it's advertisement disguised as a movie and anyone with a brain and some self esteem should be against this sort of things be put on the screen. This is the death of cinema as an form of art.",1,0,7,24 September 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Another worthless piece of trash
","So this is supposed to be the 'best' of the prequel saga, a movie that can be held in the same regard as the original trilogy if not even better. No. Absolutely not. This movie is just as dull, uninspired, nonsensical and boring as the other two. Nothing has improved since Attack of the Clones, if this is what passes for a good movie lately then it's no wonder people like Michael Bay are still allowed to make movies. This movie has the same exact flaws as the other two prequel movies because they are made by the same person with the same goal: selling action figures, make tons of money. So we meet again our heroes Anakin and Obi-Wan in a bizarre and confusing opening action scene that leads to the death of the previous movie's villain (Count Dooku) and the rescue of the Chancellor from the clutches of the evil General Grevious (a villain so important no one cared to introduce, a trademark of this franchise). Then we get to the dull and lifeless exposition scenes where we are reminded that Anakin and Padme are supposedly in love (why would a queen/senator marry an annoying teenager with rage control issues is beyond me, ask George Lucas) and that the Jedi Council does not trust the Chancellor because it's obvious he is the Sith Lord they have been searching for 10 years but somehow the wise and all- knowing Jedi masters are still unable to connect the dots. Then we get to the action, and as usual Anakin and Obi-Wan need to be separated just like in the previous movie (so there is no chance to establish any sort of friendship between the two), Obi-Wan has been given a filler content mission to justify his presence in this movie, while Anakin has to spend time with someone even more boring than Padme : the Chancellor. This was supposed to be an intriguing part of the story and I must admit that the actor playing the Chancellor did the best he could with the horrible material given to him by George Lucas, but as everything in the prequels this scene is ultimately a letdown. We have a vague speech about the dark side and that's about it. Now get ready for the main part of the plot : the reason Anakin 'turns to the dark side' (what it actually means we are never told or shown) is because he had one vague dream of Padme dying (it's very vague, we don't even see her dying so we can't be sure, but apparently Anakin is). So at this point I was done with the movie, I'm not even gonna stick around to tell you that after a overly self indulgent 30 minutes long light-sabre battle they stick Anakin in a robot suit so he can yell 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO' and Lucas can sell Darth Vader merchandise. What a piece of garbage.",1,3,6,24 September 2014
