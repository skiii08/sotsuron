Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Watch it!!
","The Phantom Menace:Disappointing? Wooden acting? Weak story line?For me this was a marvellous, and beautiful, piece of entertainment; I will be going for at least one more viewing.It should be stated that while I have always enjoyed Star Wars it is not good science fiction. It is a morality play wrapped up in a western, and placed far, far away. But what the hell - shades of grey can be soooooooooooooooo tiresome.As the culmination of this trilogy is already known the film can play with the viewers emotions in interesting ways. The introduction and development of Anakin Skywalker is very touching.My children thoroughly enjoyed the film - especially the much derided Jar Jar Binks.My only wish is that George lose his myopic perspective and release all the films on DVD!!",10,5,7,30 July 1999
