Skyfall," A 'Beautiful' Bond Job!
","You grab your seat, with a bucket of popcorn, anticipating a bond-wagon to roll you over and you see a start which is perfectly in line with that anticipation- a mad chase in a Non-British, Non-American country which provides cultural variety, crowded streets, colorful landscapes and everything one has traditionally associated with a location for a spy chase sequence. Even before you get a chance to settle in, you are asked to get ready for a trip as start credits begin to roll along with some brilliant visuals and trippy music.I have always considered Bond movies as wholesome entertainment packages with which a lot of famous names have been associated over years. I could never see it fall in the category of serious cinema where I would want to spend a lot of time. But I was pleasantly surprised and was full of hope the day I got to know that Skyfall is being directed by none other than Sam Mendes who has created more than one masterpiece in his not so long career and is a master at slow plot building/twisting and also loves to create life like characters who are complicated,dark and layered.Skyfall is a rare experience in itself .It is a blend of what Bond movies have stood for over five decades and what Mendes has perfected as an art. It is that rare bond movie where scenes are not exhilarating but are absorbing in nature. Here, director doesn't want the adrenaline to rush but wants your senses to go numb and flat before they surge back with a different kind of excitement. Skyfall is by far the most beautifully shot Bond movie ever. The climax sequence which is being shown to be happening at the time of dusk in some beautiful Scotland countryside location is one of the most hauntingly beautiful shooting sequences that you will ever come across. The manner in which blueness of sky and the glow of fire and bulbs complement each other is a sight to cherish. The portions shot in Shanghai and Macau are neither loaded with nor devoid of what you are used to see in a Bond flick but refreshingly suck you in the scenes through beautiful frames and lighting and most importantly a surrealistically relaxed treatment. In times where Nolan has created the most revered anti-hero character, it is very natural that any director, how so ever acclaimed he might be would tend to get inspired by the character of Joker (The Dark Knight). It would be extremely unfair to say that Mendes and his writers drew inspiration from Joker's character while they created Silva's character for Bardem but there is no doubt that there is uncanny similarity in the development and treatment of both these characters. Javier Bardem plays a fantastically devilish ex-agent of MI6 who takes the path of cyber- terrorism to seek revenge from M, the head of intelligence wing of British secret service played by Judi Dench. She has played her part satisfactorily as required by the plot but the expectations are much higher when an actor of her caliber is cast in a production like this and that certainly is an area where Skyfall could have thrown few more punches.Go and take a plunge in the world of Mendes's Bond. It could work for you just like it worked for me but I have a feeling that a lot of 007 aficionados would feel a little cheated.",9,1,9,10 November 2012
Casablanca," Don't just watch it, Be a part of the Epic!
","I have always watched and enjoyed movies produced all over the world but I feel its high time I put my thoughts on paper for the sake of records at least . Also, these will have the potential to create some nostalgic value later.Coincidentally, I watched Casablanca for the first time (emotionally) few days back. The movie which is largely known as one of the greatest love stories of all time is not one, its much more than a mere love story.It is a work of a man who at the time of making this piece seemed to have acquired such levels of skills in his art form that it is next to impossible to be able to find a flaw in this work even for the finest of the observers. How do I even start here? I should very well start with the image which has not left me ever since I have finished watching the movie. There is no doubt that Ingrid Bergman is one of the most naturally beautiful actresses Hollywood has seen in the last century, but in my opinion she is also one of the very few actors who could speak through their eyes exactly what was there in the heart of the character she was playing. This is a skill/gift which is found in a rare breed of actors. The scene where she looks at Rick (Humphrey Bogart) after all those years of separation is a perfect example of the role eyes ought to play to emote ones feelings without utterance of a single alphabet. Its hard to believe how she did not receive an Oscar nomination for this movie as she ended up receiving seven of them in a long glittering career. The prospect of watching all of those is a temptation that can not be defined.I haven't seen all of Bergman's fine performances but in the few that I have seen, one can easily conclude that she has the ability to give multiple layers to her character which is the case in Casablanca as well. The flair with which she has been able to shift between various moods of innocence, mystery and sheer passion is remarkable. Of course, credit must also go to Curtiz who orchestrated this mood dance. The character of Rick is like an iceberg which has been put in fire to melt and vanish and just before it starts to lose its identity it takes inspiration from itself and extinguishes the fire with the water it had lost. There could not have been a better choice for this role than Humphrey Bogart, every square inch of whose countenance reflects the state of mind he is in. Moreover, he is a true style icon in this movie and fits the part to the hilt which pops up the following question: was the role of Rick written for him or he was the best fit for the role!As is seems, the image of protagonists is at the top of my mind their role in the greatness of the movie is certainly not limited to being the faces of the movie. Having said that, below the surface its the work of a master who has engineered multiple components into a giant which overpowers most others in its proximity. This fine piece of work makes its entry straight into the list of Cinema Extraordinaire because of its universal appeal, unique treatment, essentially real yet whimsical script, gripping screenplay and stupendous display of ever changing human behavior.The range of emotions and situations this film has on offer at every stage of the movie makes it a sumptuous and delicious meal for audiences of varying taste. The movie reaches its climax in 95 minutes and it feels like that perfectly timed dessert which is an extremely rare delight. The manner in which any two characters have been linked in this movie is the most unique to say the least. There are many two way relationships which have been portrayed with considerable depth on screen in such a small time that you start wondering by the time movie reaches its final moments that how was it even possible to experience so much in such a short time.Every character leaves an indelible mark even though all it did in the movie was hit a few guitar strings or pick pocket at a restaurant. Every scene in the movie is a study in itself.This is a must watch for anyone who has ever thought of himself as a movie fan. Casablanca without doubt makes its way in my all time top 5 list!www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in",10,3,5,20 September 2012
Chak de! India," Bollywood's First of its kind.......Perfection Personified
","Aha..Finally Bollywood has a full fledged sports movie.This one is certainly worth a watch for every movie lover.This is a very well made movie with nothing unnecessary being added.Being an SRK fan I love to see him in all sorts of roles but these are the ones which bring the real actor out of him, Swades being another example.Role of a coach is perfectly portrayed by SRK.He is the most energetic actor around and he has put it all into it.The story of this movie moves very subtly and augments the excitement every next second.For a country like India with its national game as hockey this movie was long due.Finally, when it has arrived,it hasn't disappointed.It has also indirectly displayed the crippled Indian sports system which needs much improvement.Lets hope concerned people learn something from it.This movie can really do wonders for the next generation of aspiring hockey players.CDI is entertaining,insightful,inspiring and yet very simple which is its greatness.This movie succeeds in bringing out tears and giggles and also lets the adrenaline flow in full pace.The cinematography and editing are equally good.They succeeded in capturing each moment with its complete emotion.The director has treated the subject extremely well and has brought 100% from all the new actors.The character selection was spot on too. SRK and all others rocked!!!! All in all 10/10. Nothing less for this one!",8,68,86,11 August 2007
American Hustle," Originality, Style and Wit written all over it
","David Russell is on a roll. He is reinventing himself with every movie. Thanks to his splendid filmography till date, we know that he has his own and enviable style of humor. In Silver Linings Playbook he created a new genre called serious dromcom. In American Hustle he steps up and infuses humor in a rainbow of other emotions with typical Russelesque style, a style which is shockingly original and entertaining. A lot of credit should go to the fact that he has used his tried and tested cast in ever versatile Bale, coming of age -Cooper and one of the most promising female actors of these times in Jennifer Lawrence ( Oh! She is so lovable). She is so bloody convincing at everything she does that its almost impossible to not travel with her whenever she is on screen. Jeremy Renner as usual gets into the skin of the character without fuss and Amy Adams can take your breath away while she is trying to play seductive games with Bale and Cooper. ​The USP of American Hustle does not lie in its story (it is like so many other con movies that we have seen in past), it lies in the depth and range of human emotions and behaviors that have been covered and presented with amazing ease, butter smooth camera work, epic one liners and utmost attention of detail. Respect Mr. Russel.",9,1,4,6 October 2014
Dangal," Dangal is very special. Ultimate mix of technical film making and popular cinema
","Dangal (9/10) is the kind of film for which the 70mm medium exists. It has universal appeal, is technically brilliant and more than anything else it is a film that skillfully balances popular sentiments and realism. It is going to reach tens of millions of people without having compromised the quality of storytelling.An extraordinary story of some extraordinary people who not only conquered their fears but also a society which had the negativity to kill their dreams even before they were born.If Chak De was a fine example of exemplary editing in a sports film and Pan Singh Tomar was an exceptional sports film with great depth and realism, Dangal would forever be remembered as one of the best Indian sports film for the sheer reach it will have. Wrestling is a fast paced technical sport. To make the whole thing look as authentic as it has looked in the film, it would have required some meticulous planning and extensive training and they have done it really well.The fact that you feel the frustration that Mahavir Singh Phogat feels in the final scene and you along with the whole audience begins to clap after each of Geeta's winning bout as if there was a live game at display shows how supremely engaging the film is. One negative, though not significant enough to harm the film is that it has over dramatazied the narrative at the cost of slight misrepresentation of the facts.Only if the majority of Indian film makers could realize that it is not impossible to make good cinema with popular appeal, we would start getting more than just a couple of Hindi films every year worth watching. Now is a good time to list Top Films from India in the Sports/Drama genre: 1)Paan SIngh Tomar 2)Dangal 3)Chak De India 4)Iqbal 5)Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander 6)Lagaan 7)Bhaag Milkha Bhaag",9,8,11,23 December 2016
Some Like It Hot," Some Like It Hot - The Classical Comedy
","There is always a thing about Classics, even before you absorb the first frame; you are burdened with huge expectations. But, Some Like It Hot is one of those jet planes where you got to tight your seat belt and forget everything else to enjoy the joyride or you would fall off your seat.I feel casting in a movie is one of the most under discussed elements of movie making amongst general public but it plays a very significant role in the success of a movie and SLIH is the prime example of it. Apart from Jack Lemmon, none of the protagonists were known for their superior acting skills and they would not have made the cut for a Billy Wilder piece. But, in retrospect, who other than Tony Curtis who had a boyish look and at the same time possessed sharp features could have played a saxophone playing woman charmer who could cross dress to be a part of a woman band. You can only get a flawless performance from a bad actor only if he/she is playing himself/herself and that is the exact reason why Marilyn Monroe wows you in every scene of Some Like It Hot. She is playing a dumb, vivacious and vulnerable damsel who can sing, doesn't mind sleeping with a charming guy whenever she gets a chance and then dips herself in a whiskey bottle when left all alone with herself. Jack Lemmon with a broad muscular jawline was surely the one who had a better chance of getting caught as someone not in the right clothes, but that is very small price to pay, as an actor of his caliber was indispensable to the cause of SLIH. He has an amazing sense of timing when it comes to humor; he is almost chaplinesque when it comes to expressions and the confidence with which he delivers his lines puts him right at the top of stack.I am not sure when was the concept of black humor introduced in the world of cinema, but, SLIH has to be one of the better examples from the old times where black humor is integrated in the comedy. The black humor is there only to make its presence felt and nothing more. Other than that SLIH is a fun filled journey of Gerald (Lemmon) and Joseph (Curtis), two musicians on the run from dangerous Chicago gangsters who are after their lives. They find their safe house in an all-woman band that is off to Florida for a string of performances. This is where they meet the gorgeous Sugar (Marilyn) and try their luck on flattering her. It is all about how Joseph manages to get ahead in the race and Gerald like a true friend tags along without any explaining or pleading by Joseph. This is what makes SLIH sweet. The necessary salt is added to the movie by little moments like women having a party on train, Sugar hiding whiskey in her stocking, Fielding (Joe Brown) hitting on Dalphe (Gerald disguised as a woman) and further complications that set in because of these. What makes this classical comedy special is the fact that it makes you laugh at so many occasions without being slapstick or cheap or using the chaos technique. And when it doesn't make you laugh, it makes you smile. Most importantly, the movie stays with you.The manner in which the movie begins, it suddenly makes you wonder - that's too much of real car chasing and shooting for a black and white movie of 40's and then you realize it's done in 1959 and the movie was intentionally produced in black and white. The first scene itself is a cracker and will create a cocktail of emotions, with words like liquor, crime, party, death, music all floating around at the same time. There are plenty of scenes where the camera pans out from one object to another capturing multiple things with different moods and complexion in the same scene and that is a technique which I guess wasn't used quite frequently back then. Make-up job of Curtis and Lemmon is too good for those times and it would have been so important for that to have been correctly done as that is absolutely central to the whole plot. Marilyn's costumes are way modern and she carries them effortlessly.Some Like It Hot is without any doubt a classic but, probably in no other movie would have the last line played such an important role as in this. The finishing frames where Joe Brown utters the unexpected leave you pleasantly surprised and I am sure it would have had far better impact on the audience 50 years back.",8,7,8,2 October 2012
12 Years a Slave," McQueen's poetic justice to the menace of slavery
","Arguably the most remarkable movie ever made on the freedom of human soul along with Schindler's List, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and The Shawshank Redemption. If this piece of cinema can not make one respect and value one's freedom more, only actual loss of freedom will. It is hard to watch and harder to ignore.It is unflinching and provocative. Steve McQueen has surpassed his previous works by miles when it comes to the scope of the theme, story telling, making the audience part of his vision, detailing, replicating costumes, tenor, sensibilities of a period dating more than 150 years back. At times, when he has juxtaposed silence, motion, sound and beauty of nature with the actions of characters/situations in the movie, he reminds you of Terence Malick, just that the message here is equally beautiful yet less ambiguous and more purposeful.McQueen has not for once held himself back and as a result created some absolutely unforgettable scenes and it is impossible for the viewer to not get absorbed by those. ​The casting couldn't have been better. McQueen sticks with Michael Fassbender for the powerhouse character of the movie, the ruthless slave owner. Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt are all cast almost perfectly. And with the superlative performance that Mr. Chiwetel Ejiofor has delivered, there is no doubt that we have 3 top contenders for the Oscars with Matthew McConaughey and Leonardo DiCaprio filling the other two spots. It would be completely unfair to not mention the young actor, Lupita Nyong'o for playing probably the most difficult role in the movie. ​The background score is minimalistic but even with limited scope only Hans Zimmer could have communicated the emotions of the scenes as powerfully as they have been depicted through the visual medium.This one is a must for everyone to have in their personal library because you will surely want to watch it again",9,0,2,6 October 2014
Inside Llewyn Davis," Coen Brothers' ode to the heart of a true artist
","​​​Inside Llewyn Dewis is not a quintessential Coen Brothers' movie. It ain't dark. It doesn't have cold humor. It won't stay with you all your life. But, it is still one hell of a movie. Technically, it is as good as any period musical drama character study can get. It is a story of the journey of an artist and a celebration of a musical form, the folk music. It is about the heartbreaks and 'no breaks' that an artist can get if he is not ready to compromise his standing on the manner and style of creation and display of the art form which gives him maximum pleasure and satisfaction. Inside Llewyn Davis literally takes us inside the heart of a true artist, how fragile it is and how that fragility, those sentiments translate into his works, in this case, his voice and his music. It is a lovely movie and thank god there was Oscar Isaac, a Julliard graduate singer actor because it is hard to imagine anyone else doing justice to the role. Carey Mulligan in her short part in the movie, once again reminds you of how she made you fall in love with her in her previous movies. ​Anyone who has ever felt the need to create art and has felt a special connection between his feelings and the desired output, you are in for an amazing ride.",9,0,0,6 October 2014
