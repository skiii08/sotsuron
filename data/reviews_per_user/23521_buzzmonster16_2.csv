Sucker Punch," An Anti-Critic Review
","Now after watching a few interviews and discussions on TV and the internet I have discovered one thing: most critics do not enjoy the movies the general public seems to love. Why is this? Movie critics think way to much about the movies and they cannot enjoy it like most people can and will do. That is the problem with this movie. Most critics do not like fantasy movies due to being unrealistic. The thing is, ALL movies are unrealistic. Every single movie or story is either made up or has something added to a true story. Well, today I am turning away from the critics and giving this movie a two-thumbs up. I loved this movie. Especially for a guy in his teens with all the action, girls, and guns in the movie. However, you do have to figure some things out, which I don't mind. Especially with a slight twist at the end (spoiler). I love Zack Snyder's idea of escaping your reality and using your imagination to solve life's hard problems. This idea is enjoyment to the viewer, because normally we cannot do this in the real world. I will admit the imagination scenes are a little long, but there is not one boring part in the action scenes or the movie. If you ever want to see a movie, do not trust the critics. You are the only one to say if a movie is good or bad, not another person. Especially since most of them are to stuck-up to like any of the interesting movies.",9,5,10,25 April 2011
Sherlock Holmes," The Old Times Becomes the New Generation's Favorite Thing
","Before this movie, Sherlock Holmes was another book. I really never cared for literature or much reading. However, I walked into this movie theater expecting to see just another movie, but it turned out to be my favorite movie I have seen in my life so far. I have always been a fan of mystery and action movies and I like them even more so if they are together. When my parents brought me to this movie I had no idea that I was walking into Robert Downey Jr. showing step-by-step moves to take down his enemy. In the very first minutes, I was at the edge of my seat, waiting impatiently for more. As the movie developed, I enjoyed the sense of comfort of the connection between Downey and Law. They worked very well together. I loved the mystery in this movie and Holmes enhances it by the way he deduces. At the end of the movie, I was aw struck in thinking 'Why did life just stop.' I did not want this movie to end and when I got home, I immediately got on the computer to see when the second one was coming out. I loved the acting, the feel of the city, and the story line to the movie. I loved it so much, that it got me reading the whole series of the 'Sherlock Holmes' collection. This is just one example on how much the new generation can take so much interest of olden times. It can be enjoyed in many forms, but for this, I am glad it was in a movie.P.S. Thanks Mom and Dad for taking me to the movies that day. Love you guys.",Null,1,1,25 April 2011
