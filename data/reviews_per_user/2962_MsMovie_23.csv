The Incredible Hulk," Awful - don't know why anyone likes this CGI monster.
","I can't write anything about this at all because I thought it was overall bad - I didn't like the over-use of CGI, I felt like I was watching a cartoon not a live action movie.The acting was so-so, but really, I wouldn't waste any money going to the movies - get it from Blockbuster in a couple of months and save yourself the agony of having to sit through this.I know loads of people seem to have liked this - I just don't know why!I really enjoyed Indiana Jones, and I loved Iron Man - this just didn't live up to the expectations I had of it being better than the atrociously bad first Hulk movie.",6,16,37,13 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," JJ Abrams revives the MI franchise!
","Firstly, I don't buy into any of the whole Tom Cruise personal life affecting this movie - let me get that off my chest instantly. The reason this movie did not open well was simply because Mission Impossible 2 was so AWFUL, that many people would really not want to see this movie until they heard the buzz from everyone who did pay to go see MI:III. I understand this - movie going is expensive after all, so you have to wait until you are sure you really want to sit thru 2 hours of potentially bad movie.Thankfully, JJ Abrams, of ALIAS fame, has worked the story well - it has some depth, you get to see Ethan Hunt living his regular life and trying to be a normal guy away from his spying career. Ving Rhames' character returns and is STILL the most likable thing about the whole franchise.So, we have Ethan with a personal life and a girlfriend ( no spoiler there as that is in all the trailers ), and he gets involved in some stuff, ya dee ya dah.This is a good action movie - it could have done with some more development of the bad guys role and of Keri Russell's role, as those parts seem to be over really quick and you're trying to work it all out while still following the plot. There are a couple of nice plot twists, which most film-goers will not see coming, much in the line of ALIAS's interesting plot lines.Go and see this movie if you enjoyed the original mission Impossible movie - read some of the reviews written about it and you will see that it is well worth the price of at least a matinée ticket (big explosions and stunts are way better on a movie screen).And if you are planning not to see this movie because you don't like Tom Cruise personally because of his behavior I say GROW UP - I have met a few actors in real life and believe me, a lot of them are total JERKS off screen (not saying that Tom is a jerk, but you get my meaning), but here is Tom Cruise, the actor, playing a role, that is TOTALLY not what he is like in reality - therefore, if you are a normal, reasonable human being, you will get that this is a movie, and Tom is an actor playing a role and this movie is well worth seeing.Mission Impossible 4 now really does seem possible, but ONLY if JJ does this sequel - otherwise forget it - and for goodness sake keep John Woo away from it!",7,2,3,11 May 2006
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," It's a good movie, but it's not a great one by any means.
","So, I was dying for this story to come out, I mean who doesn't want to know how the rebel alliance got its hands on the plans to the Death Star so they could destroy it.**SPOILER** So we get a female hero, yay to that, but did she have to be ANOTHER abandoned child? I mean really? She gets found by Saw Gerrera, played in Razzie winning fashion by the usually great Forest Whitaker. We don't really know what happens after that because it's glossed over very glibly, but somehow she turns into a criminal, etc.So much of the movie is just a gloss coat of story. I would have liked to hear the characters telling of their back stories at least, but there really wasn't much development there at all.The story itself was OK - we see our hero gathering together her rag tag band of heroes, and off they go to make the ultimate sacrifice.Did I care that they didn't make it out? Nope, didn't really care about any of them at all.Did I care when Han Solo got killed by his douche of a son in The Force Awakens? Hell yeah. I was like NO!!! The best parts of the movie were when Darth Vader was in it (briefly) and when R2D2 and C3PO made an appearance. Those parts cheered my Star Wars fan's soul.It wasn't like it was a bad movie, it was quite good - but will I buy it when it comes on DVD, well maybe to complete my collection, but I doubt I will watch it over and over like the others.The music was great and the special effects were stellar as always.The casting was ho-hum, but mostly it was the 2 dimensional scripting that bothered me. I like to have back stories, I like believable motivation in my characters.Mostly, I expect to give a damn who lives or dies.This latter point bothered me the most, and to be totally frank, when Forest Whitaker's character died, well, it was a relief because his over-acting was awful and his character's arc made little sense.I gave it 6/10 because I wanted to be honest, as a Star Wars fan of 39 years and counting, that it wasn't as great as I have been hearing from everyone else.",5,6,14,18 December 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The most fun I have had at the cinema this summer...
","... which just shows you how bad the supposed 'big' releases really were. I mean, I had never really heard much about this movie, and only went because I saw Johnny Depp's name on it, and I was more than pleasantly surprised.This is a good, old-fashioned, swash-buckling, rollicking adventure movie with a few special effects thrown in for good measure.The cast was great, the effects were there, but did not take over the movie, (perhaps the makers of The Hulk should take note of this comment!) and the script was an old-fashioned Saturday morning crowd pleaser.Thank God for this movie - the only movie of the summer that has risen above the total dross at the box office.Roll on December and The Return of the King!",8,0,1,11 August 2003
Spider-Man 2," Excellent second installment!
","This movie was brilliant and remember I am a girl, and therefore not into comic books at all.From the fantastic opening titles which briefly retold the first movie to help you remember it, in case you hadn't seen it recently, to the better than expected ending.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continued their good work from the first movie, and the rest of the returning cast were great, especially the newspaper editor, whose name I can never remember (sorry).The story had a good pace and enough impact moments to keep you going, and the dramatic portions were usually followed by some humor or a good action scene to move the story along, and there is still plenty to tell for a third installment too.I couldn't find any faults with the movie at all - the special effects were fantastic, I know a lot of it was CGI, but it was not obvious CGI, and the music really went with the movie in total.The only question I ever have with superhero movies is - where do their clothes go to? But that's too prosaic to worry about when it's a Marvel type story, so I will just brush that thought to one side.I gave this movie a 10 because in my view it is well worth the price of a movie ticket, in fact I could go see it again and would not begrudge paying twice (but since I have a subscription card I go free anyway!).The 10 vote was not because it is the best movie I have ever seen, it was because it is 100% worth seeing, just bear in mind there are some violent parts that may not be suitable for either young children, or people who are bothered by that kind of thing.Thank God for Spiderman, I watched it back to back with Thunderbirds and if you are reading this review for pity's sake, do NOT see that movie!",7,0,0,17 July 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Instantly Forgettable  mostly we froze, who cares?
","There will not be many spoilers in this review, as there really isn't that much to spoil. This movie has a lot of special effects, and many of them are excellent, but it doesn't have much of anything else to promote it to a potential audience member. Therefore, I could only say save your money and hire it on DVD, preferably when Blockbuster are doing a rent one, get one free deal, then you can pick a good movie to watch after this one.The worst thing about this movie is it is like Deep Impact in its character depictions  the characters are wooden, stereotyped and lacking in any real depth, so quite frankly you don't care if they live or die, and there are so few of them as well that you really feel there is not enough plot to drive this movie for the length of time we have to endure it.And what is it with disaster movies  why does nobody believe the so-called experts until it is too late? Dennis Quaid was OK in his scientific role, but really he was pretty one-dimensional and he can act a lot better than this (see Frequency if you don't believe me).The silly little romance between Jake Gyllenhal and whoever she was, was trite and seemed to be thrown in to give the plot a little more story, but it was a non-starter really.We didn't even have the ubiquitous old lady to kill off (like in Daylight and Dante's Peak), or the truly lovable dog to save (like in Independence Day, Dante's Peak and Daylight), I mean there was a dog with a homeless guy, but who cared about him anyway?I would give most of the special effects in this movie a 7 out of 10  they were good but nothing really new. The acting would only get a 5, as most of the actors didn't seem to be doing much. The plot, even though it's topical, would get a 3, as it seemed mostly to be ludicrous and full of itself.Someone should tell the producers of this movie that a big budget and loads of effects do not make a good movie, a good script does!",7,0,0,5 June 2004
Lost in Translation," This is a great movie - a real outsider for an Oscar!
","I went to see this movie because the other movie I saw was so short I had time to kill, but I wasn't at all sure I would enjoy it - I was wrong, as per usual!This film is great - it tells the story of two displaced foreigners trying to cope with spending time in Japan, when they would truthfully much rather be somewhere else.Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murray are perfectly teamed - the age difference isn't even an issue because they acknowledge the difference in the story anyway.Bill plays a famous actor who is reduced to promoting alcoholic drinks for very large sums of money because there isn't the work for him that there used to be, and Scarlett is the wife of a photographer who just came along on his trip for the ride. Both are bored silly by being in Japan, they don't understand what is going on half the time, or what people are saying to them and they both feel trapped by their lives.Then they meet each other, and I won't say anything more except go and see this movie, or rent it on DVD, it's well worth it.To be totally honest, the first 15 minutes are a little slow, but persevere, it's brilliant once you get into the story and this is Bill Murray's best work in a long time.There should be Oscar nominations for this movie this week for definite - I would say best screenplay, possibly best director, best actor could be there, and best actress as well. It may well get overshadowed by all those big epic movies out there, but let's keep our fingers crossed!This movie is a must-see for anyone who likes to watch movies that explore character's feelings, but is not for anyone who likes a lot of action - this is a thinkers movie!",8,0,1,26 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Tour De Force in movies (from someone who has never read the books!)
","Well, what can I say? I had heard so many mixed reviews from so many quarters before seeing this movie, that I was a little nervous. I mean, was I going to waste my hard earned cash, and 'my precious' christmas vacation time spending close to three hours in a movie theatre? Well, the answer was no, it was certainly not a waste of money!This is a review from someone who has never read any of the books - has actually attempted to, several times, but found them far too unappealing and much too much like hard work, yet I still was fascinated enough to want to see this movie.I couldn't say if it is a faithful adaptation of the book - having seen the first Harry Potter movie (and knowing what was left out of that), I would say that it is unlikely that the director could fit everything in. But looking at 'fellowship' as simply a movie, it is one of the rare classics that will be watched over and over again, and no doubt, we will all find additional parts that we missed the first time too.Elijah Wood is exceptionally well cast as Frodo, as are the rest of the cast members - especially Viggo Mortensen, who puts just the right amount of regal bearing into his moves and actions to make you yearn for Part III to arrive, so we can see the Return of the King.The scenery (very irrelevant to the plot and movie critique I know)was amazing, making me now want to visit New Zealand, and altogether I thought this was well worth a full price ticket.My only 'con', if you like, is the number of people who took children under the age of 5 into this film and my comment to all of you who are thinking of doing this in the future is PLEASE DON'T. For one thing, these children found the fight scenes and monsters very scary, for another they got bored, as they did not have the intellectual skills to follow the plot. And lastly on this point, if you can afford a frickin' movie ticket, then surely you can afford a baby sitter so that the rest of us poor theatre goers don't have to put up with your kids being in a pain in the.....THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN!Go and see this movie once, just to say you went, a second time, to get all the plot points, and a third time just for the hell of it.Roll on next year and Book II of the Lord of the Rings trilogy - an outstanding movie to end the year with!",9,0,0,26 December 2001
Hugo," An OK movie, but NOT for kids - they will be bored to death!
","I made the mistake of believing the trailers for this movie which made it look like a cross between Harry Potter and the Narnia movies. It's not at all like that. It is a movie for movie buffs to enjoy, who will get all the movie related homages. It's a movie for teenagers definitely, those who have the patience to sit through a 'kids' movie this long. I would definitely not recommend it for the average kid under 10 years old - it's not violent or anything like some of Scorcese's other movies, it's just not kid friendly. Take the under 10's to Arthur Christmas and leave this one to the teens and adults - they will most likely find it visually stunning, breathtaking in fact, if a bit lacking in concrete plot - and there are some pretty big holes in this plot too.Quite frankly, as an adult who LOVES movies, I found it to be beautifully crafted, beautifully shot, but I won't watch it again because it was totally lacking in story.Why do we watch a movie again and again? Because we love to relive the story over and over again, even overlooking the parts that were not that great (I'm thinking 'It's a Wonderful Life''s talking angel stars - perhaps good SFX at the time, just annoying now!).Sorry Mr Scorcese - it's beautiful, like a Monet, Picasso etc, but I don't want to own it or re-watch it again.Honestly, I preferred The Polar Express - similar hype, better story, definitely one to own. This one, not so much!",5,1,4,5 December 2011
"I, Robot"," A great sci-fi action movie!
","Using an Isaac Asimov story as the basis makes this one of the best sci-fi action movies made in a very long time, on a par with the likes of Blade Runner and Gattaca.It's the story of Del Spooner who really doesn't like the way robots are taking over everything in our world (30 years in the future). Robots are everywhere and they are meant to obey 3 fundamental rules which basically are all for the protection of humans - they cannot harm us.So how come one robot seems to have murdered his creator - and the creator of in fact all the robots?You'll have to watch the movie to find out.It's part sci-fi, part murder mystery story, part action movie, and all entertaining.I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire film and next to Spiderman 2, this has been my favorite of the year I think.Go and see this movie if you like mystery and sci-fi, or Asimov's writings.I gave this movie a 10 - my basis is that a 10 is a movie you should see at the cinema that was excellent (it doesn't mean it was the best film ever, but undeniably watchable!).Will Smith is the new $100,000,000 dollar man!",8,1,2,6 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A good movie  but it leaves out so much of the book!
","If you are a Harry Potter fan without the benefit of reading the books, then I am sure you really enjoyed this latest movie, and perhaps thought it was the best of the trio so far. Most of the fans of the books have said the same thing to me, they were a little disappointed at how much was left out.Having said that I am not comparing the movie to a book for the purpose of this review, so I will say the special effects were outstanding as always  I don't know how they achieve a lot of what is on screen, especially the flying Hippogriff, but it is so seamless that you really don't think it's a special effect at the time, it's only after that you think back on how good the effects were.I would have preferred there to be more subplots in the story, as there certainly were more in the book, but for some reason they left them out.The young actors are growing up in their roles, and I didn't find there was anything wrong with their acting at all, although some people have made comments about their accents being hard to understand. Obviously these people are not British because the accents are not at all hard to understand, but to someone non-British they could be  much in the same way as I struggled to understand some of the accents in Cold Mountain, etc.I think in the next movie I would like there to be more interaction with the adult actors  especially the best ones, like Snape and Hagrid, and perhaps for it not to be quite so dark (I don't mean evil-dark, I just mean dull-dark!).I gave this movie a 9 out of 10  it was exactly what I wanted and expected, and I enjoyed it greatly, I can't wait for November 2005 now for The Goblet of Fire!",9,0,0,5 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Theatrical vs Directors Cut
","OK, I watched this movie in the cinema earlier this year and I quite liked it.I had heard from the critics, etc, that they didn't think it was a good movie, so I wasn't expecting much.It's the story of a young man who has been having black outs all his life and discovers in college that he can go back to these parts of his life and change things by reading over the events in his journal. And let me tell you, this kid has had a very eventful life all in all.Now, here we have your basic time-travel / time changing story - it was well played as a theatrical release, about the right length and the actors were good, especially the usually comical Ashton Kutcher.Then I made the DIRE and DREADFUL mistake of watching the director's cut - which may as well be a different movie altogether as it TOTALLY SUCKS. I don't know what the director was thinking when he added the extra parts he felt needed to be in the movie - including a ludicrous visit to a crystal ball toting clairvoyant who proclaims 'you have no life line' in a scene that is completely ridiculous, pointless and adds nothing to the original movie.Then there is the ending, which is completely different to the theatrical release - in the cinema version the main character finally 'gets' that he can't play God, he puts things to rights and then he gets on with his life, and lets the woman he will always love have her life. It's not the best ending, but it's tidy and it works for the audience, it doesn't leave the audience disappointed.The director's cut made me realize that some movie directors are obviously meglomaniacal idiots, completely full of their own importance, because the revised ending is stupid beyond belief. I mean, in the movie we are expected to suspend disbelief and believe that the character can re-read his journals and go back in time to change things at those points when he had blackouts etc - we manage to do that. But to expect a person with an ACTUAL BRAIN to believe the revised ending is dumb, dumb, DUMB.COMPLETE SPOILER for the director's cut ending - does he go back in time to stop himself from becoming friends with the girl, and therefore save them all a lot of heartache - NO - he goes back to the WOMB (yes, the fricking womb!), and makes sure he was never born in the first place. Oh yeah, that's believable, that makes sense - no it doesn't, it makes a mockery of the entire plot and expects the audience to just accept something that is so totally beyond comprehension that it cannot be accepted.Shame on the director for having an ego the size of a small country - did he even go to film school at all, because this ending is so bad, you'd think it was a first year film student writing his first screenplay and one who didn't really know how to end it, so made a terrible rookie mistake.Don't watch the director's cut - watch the theatrical version, it is more cohesive and you will be less irritated in the long run.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 - for the cinema version only.(If I were rating the director's cut it would only get a 3 out of 10.)",7,0,2,23 October 2004
Wreck-It Ralph," So much fun for all ages - great family movie!
","I saw the trailers for this way back and thought the concept sounded like a good one, but Disney don't always deliver well on the promise of a good concept. This time they did it really well, this movie is fun, not too long, has likable characters, humor and a really nice story with a message that isn't preachy at all about how people get put into a little box in life and it's really hard to get out of it.We all know that feeling, and Ralph knows it only too well. You've seen the trailers, he's supposed to wreck stuff and only do that, but he wants more than that.I won't give you any spoilers, I will just say the screening we saw had kids of all ages in it from toddlers to teens, and parents, grandparents and some adults without kids with them at all.John C Reilly is great, Sarah Silverman (who I don't generally like in live action stuff), is brilliant, and the voice talents chosen were spot on.It's not Pixar, but it's the best animated original story Disney has produced in years - take your family, you'll have fun! *** One note *** The Wii game of the same name is NOT good - it does NOT follow the movie plot and it's just a bad game.",8,7,9,7 November 2012
2012," How did they take the Mayan calendar paranoia and turn it into this awful movie?
","I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 because it really doesn't have a great story, I mean, the Mayan calendar ending in 2012 is a great story in itself and you'd think with that for inspiration this would have been a very disconcerting and scary look into the future. But no, it is just a bad disaster movie.SPOILER ALERT How many time can a person outrun the earth shattering and quaking beneath them? Apparently, John Cusack can do it about 6 times, and on the 3rd time he was in a plane that just narrowly made it off the ground and just narrowly missed buildings that were collapsing around it, well, I was talking to the screen by then and saying 'seriously? again?' And can I just say the special effects weren't that great either, I have definitely seen better, and once you have seen one city crashing to the ground and one tidal wave, it's time for something new.I love John Cusack too - HE was the reason I wanted to see this movie, and to be truthful he was the only reason I watched until the end because his character (2 dimensional though it was), was the only one I actually cared enough about to see what happened.George Seagal (spelling may be wrong here!), but he was actually in this movie - no idea why, he had a trivial little part as an entertainer on a cruise ship. SPOILER COMING NOW - the cruise ship is in dock (right at the beginning of the movie), and it starts to rock wildly and in a very scary fashion before it leaves harbor - why would you not get off the boat? Seriously, no one in their right mind would stay on the boat after that, but no they stayed. There was some other trivial little aside where George calls his son who he doesn't speak to, but who really cared at all about that, it was inconsequential.SPOILER AGAIN - they wiped out LA at one point, but there didn't seem to be too much concern in other parts of the USA at that point, or the rest of the world, so it was all very emotionless at times, and that isn't what a good disaster movie is supposed to be about.In Independence Day we cared if the darn dog made it into the side tunnel - we cared about the crazy drunk crop spraying pilot - we cared about the president, etc.Danny Glover was wasted in this movie, as was Oliver Platt - they were almost cartoon like, cardboard characters with no depth at all.They should have concentrated on John Cusack's character and had him find out about the conspiracy theory (Woody Harrelson's cameo side story), find out about the arks, work at it that way and give you small pieces of the rest of the story and show the horror from his family's POV as they saw what was happening to the world.Instead, what we got was a hodge podge of set pieces, with so-so special effects (nothing we haven't seen before), a groan-worthy script, and a whole load of great actors who got hung out to dry by a director who seemed more concerned with destroying buildings, and blowing stuff up to make loud noises for the Dolby sound, than he was concerned about making a darned good story.Deep Impact was not a particularly good movie, and unfortunately 2012 is on the same par. I don't blame the actors, it's all Emmerich's fault and I hope someone else comes out with a movie about the same topic, since it is still relevant, and makes a real attempt to construct a story that will at once be terrifying in its possibilities and thoroughly entertaining.This is one movie definitely more deserving of a Redbox rental than a box office ticket!",6,8,11,14 March 2010
World Trade Center," From 9/11 - it is the courage we need to remember!
","I really don't understand why some people seem to hate this movie so much - and it's not because they think it is too soon; these people actually hate this movie because they think it isn't any good.Well, I have to disagree.It tells a simple story of a handful of people who were really involved in the events of 9/11.It tells it without over-sentimentality for the horrific events.It tells it without many special effects, and with some real TV footage to illustrate much of the horror felt by the people on the ground.The story is mainly about 2 Port Authority police officers who got caught inside the chaos when the Towers fell. It tells how their families felt, and the viewer gets to experience a little of what the horror felt like, not on a national or international level, but on a human level.***SMALL SPOILER HERE*** This is a very small spoiler, which is only relevant to anyone who didn't actually see the footage in 2001 as the 2 officers were brought out of the rubble (which I did).When they bring out the 2 survivors, as we know they will since it is a true story, I did feel a certain sense of relief, but at the same time I had an overwhelming feeling of sadness for the 2700 or so people who didn't have the same lucky fate.I think this movie could be an Oscar contender - these stories are real, unlike United 93, which was fictionalized because no one really knows what happened on that flight, they can only hypothesize and guess and piece together fragments.Nicholas Cage does a great job, and Oliver Stone really surprised me with this one - it was not at all like his other politically charged movies! I gave this movie a 10 - because it needed to be made, so we remember that it wasn't just buildings that fell - it was human souls that left this earth that day too.",6,3,9,10 August 2006
The Last Samurai," An epic movie in the mould of Gladiator!
","OK, I was predisposed to dislike this movie, having seen some of Tom Cruise's questionable prior choices, like the bizarre Vanilla Sky, or the appallingly awful Mission Impossible II, yet here I was more than pleasantly surprised.This is Tom's BEST movie for years!But let's ignore the fact that Tom Cruise is in this movie at all and concentrate on just how fantastic this film actually is. It follows the tradition of movies like Gladiator; great music, a great script, fantastic casting, brilliant direction and a wonderful location.Ken Watanabe is magnificent in his role as the leader of the last of the samurai warriors. The action is brutal, but not graphic or gratuitous. The samurai are portrayed in a way that shows them for the noble breed they were, and when the final fight scene ends (and I will give nothing away about what happens), there were a lot of people reaching for their tissues because the director got his point across so well - the samurai were fighting their own people and it was a total waste and should not have been allowed to happen.If this movie isn't nominated for Oscars this week, well, there is something wrong with the Academy, and I think my tip for best supporting actor is Ken Watanabe, he really was fantastic in this film.Go and see this movie if you liked Gladiator, or Cold Mountain, or even Gone With The Wind - it's that kind of an epic, timeless!",8,0,0,26 January 2004
Wedding Crashers," A great summer comedy!
","What can I say about the Wedding Crashers - other than it probably doesn't really deserve it's R rating - I have definitely seen much worse. It will probably get a 15 rating in the United Kingdom, which means you must be 15 to see it.We need some new age restriction ratings here too.Anyway, I digress. Owen Wilson is great in this movie, well actually, he is the same as he is in every other movie, but he is a funny guy, he knows his strengths in comedy and he plays his role well. And what can I say about Vince Vaughn, the big guy - he is just funny every which way.The one to look out for is Australian born newcomer Isla Fisher - you won't know the name so let me just say she is Vince Vaughns CRAZY girlfriend in this movie. She steals so many scenes with her deranged laugh and comical expressions.I would vote Wedding Crashers as the surprise hit of the summer - streets ahead of the rest of the dross out there (don't get me started on Stealth, good grief!).Go and see the Wedding Crashers if you liked movies like American Pie, Dodgeball, etc. You are guaranteed to laugh and 100% guaranteed to have a great date, if this is your date night movie.I gave this movie a solid 10 out of 10 because it delivered everything the movie posters and trailers promised - I did laugh out loud, I had fun and I left the theater with a smile on my face.Definitely one to buy on DVD!",8,0,3,16 August 2005
Man on Fire," Denzel's the man!
","What can I say? I saw Denzel's picture on the movie poster, had no clue what this was about, but went to see it because, well, it was Denzel Washington!It is the story of  a burned out ex-CIA, ex-government, ex-spy  he's out of shape, he drinks, he feels bad about all the stuff he has done in the past.He gets given a second chance when he goes to be the bodyguard of a young girl (the ever-talented Dakota Fanning  does this child ever sleep?), as she lives in South America and kidnappings of rich people's families are rife. Inevitably we know she will get kidnapped, but Denzel's character doesn't let her go without a fight.The movie is about the fight to try to get her back, a botched ransom drop, and the kidnappers announcement that they killed the little girl. Denzel's character then goes on a crusade to prove his own innocence (as some believe he is in league with the kidnappers), find the kidnappers and gets his revenge for killing the child he had come to love and exposing the bad guys.If you think I have given away most of the plot let me tell you  WAY NO! There are subtle layers in this movie, there is a lot of intrigue and double-dealing going on, and the ending is very good and perhaps not at all where some would think we are leading  and I think we could definitely subtitle this movie as `revenge is sweet', the squeamish might want to look away on occasions, I know I did cringe a few times!This is a great dramatic film thriller, and there are very few of these around. I would recommend this to any adult who is sick of sequels and special effects  this is original and quite a dark and sinister story, and the acting is excellent from all the lead characters, including Marc Anthony who I only know as a singer!Definitely an 8 out of 10 movie!",8,0,0,5 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I wish they would make episodes 7,8, and 9!
","What am I going to do now I have no Star Wars to look forward to? OK, so I have Harry Potter (the book and the movie) - but Star Wars was my first big movie memory, and now George Lucas says it is over.Shame on you George - we want episodes 7, 8 and 9 too - let someone else make them for goodness sake - we just want to see the end! I have to agree that Natalie Portman and Hayden Christiansen (spelling?) are really not the best choices for the two lead roles - but they do a good enough job, and the story does finish off the prequel series quite well.I agree with other reviewers that some of the reasoning behind Anakin's move to the dark side is not quite believable - but then, have you ever read any true stories of how people became serial killers and other evil people? Well, most of their stories are totally incredible too so maybe we just have to realised that Anakin's character was weak minded and evil? I think I will believe that, it makes the whole movie experience that much more enjoyable.Anyone who is a true Star Wars fan will find they totally enjoy seeing this movie - how can you not when you get such a sense of closure afterwards? My one piece of advice is - don't take little kids who scare easily or bore easily (we had some in our showing and they were very annoying!), also, don't sit too close to the screen as the FX are spectacular at times and need to be viewed in full to be appreciated.I sense an Oscar coming for the music and the FX, and probably sound editing and film editing too.I gave this 10 out of 10 for the sheer enjoyment of being in the movie theatre with so many fans, the anticipation, the great ad's and merchandising and yeah, the movie was sweet too!",7,1,5,19 May 2005
Rango," Not suitable for kids under 7 in my honest opinion!
","I went to see this movie under extreme protest and it was OK - I didn't like the type of animation used, nor the western theme, but it had an OK story and even though it was pretty formulaic I can certainly see it appealing to a certain type of audience.I have to say a lot of the themes, language and jokes were simply not kid friendly at all - I had little kids with me as it was only PG rated and they were really, really bored by about 45 minutes in. Two of them actually left with their parent and I saw a lot of other parents with small (toddler - Kindergarten age) kids exiting about an hour in.So, this movie won the box office for sure this week, but I think a lot of parents who waited will not want to go next week when they talk to their friends who will say it is definitely an older kids movie - I'd say honestly 8-10 and upwards.I think this was a solid entry into animation for the director who may be carving his niche by the way his movies are animated - it's not pretty animation, it's not at all cutesie - personally I found it very unappealing visually. But, Tim Burton makes movies that are equally unappealing to me that are loved by his solid core of fans - I think this would appeal to Tim Burton fans a lot.All in all, not an enjoyable movie experience for me - I felt like the plot was a little thin and by the end of the 90 or so minutes I was SO glad it was over.I can't wait for Cars 2 to come out in May - now that movie will appeal to me visually - I'm a Pixar groupie, no wonder this one wasn't my style really.Read some of the other reviews on here, but heed my warning - don't take your under 8's - their whining when they are bored gets very tedious!",4,11,28,6 March 2011
Shrek," Watched this again today - it's still fantastic!
","I saw this movie when it originally came out at the cinema, and I thought it was one of the best animated movies ever done - a great comedy too.
Anyway, I have not seen Shrek 2 yet, but since my mother has decided she wants to see it too we watched the first Shrek today, as she had never seen that particular film.It is probably one of the funniest movies I have seen in the last 5 years or so - animated or live action. The humour appeals on so many levels - the kids watching get all the fairy tale jokes and so do the adults, and then there are a lot of one liners, especially from Eddie Murphy's Donkey character and from Mike Myers as Shrek, which only the adults in the audience truly get.And the story is really good too - there is a moral point in there that all the kids I know really got, and one boy (who is facially disfigured himself), said it was nice to see that even though she an ogre still at the end, Shrek loved her anyway and still thought she was beautiful - if only life was like that all the time!Shrek is a film that both adults and children will want to watch over and over again and it deserves to have made the millions it did for all involved.I rated this film as a 10 because it is a great movie, if I gave it less that would be saying there was something slightly wrong with it, but really I couldn't fault it.A great movie experience for all the family!",8,6,8,5 June 2004
Fifty Shades of Grey," OMG, this is SO bad.
","I have to say right from the start that I read the entire first book and that I thought it was absolutely horrible - badly written erotica at best with a lame plot and a horribly pathetic female lead and a very unlikeable hero (who was no hero to me).That out of the way, I saw Jamie Dornan was cast and heard they changed a lot of the story for the movie script and thought maybe it would be OK, but it wasn't.I counted 10 people who left at some part during the movie and never came back, which is rare these days as people tend to stay to get their money's worth out of the price of the ticket.The settings are nice at times and so is the music, but the acting (Jamie what were you thinking????) was so wooden. It was almost like a Saturday Night Live skit, except they weren't playing for laughs in this movie they were serious, but it was cringeworthy at best.Christian Grey is no hero, and Dakota Johnson was so understated it was like she wasn't even there at all.Not a good movie - definitely not a date movie (I was so irritated by it by the time I left, no one was getting lucky!).The good parts of the movie - really the music is the best part and the end, because it was finally over - could have been a good 20 minutes shorter! The bad parts - the script was like a really bad 1960's Mills & Boon romance, and it was so slow you could honestly fall asleep if the acting weren't so painfully wooden.If you are looking for a good mainstream movie to watch to get turned on, find one on Netflix, Google movies that are sexy, you'll find something much more titillating.I am so glad some of the actors who were originally considered decided to say no, this movie could be a career killer! I hope it isn't the number 1 movie this week purely because it would be a shame if this drivel is what Americans actually want to watch and think is sexy. Men of course will enjoy the naked parts, of course they will, Dakota has a nice body, but as a woman, I don't ever want to be as wussy as Anastasia and I sure don't want women in general thinking it's OK to be abused by a guy in the name of sex.Being tied up is great in a committed relationship, it's fun, it's NOT abusive - BUT in this movie, it's creepy, borderline degrading and just uncomfortable.The funniest part for me (apart from the script!) was how uncomfortable the men who had clearly come in with their wives thinking they were going to get lucky later, and clearly wanted to leave and couldn't. Hilarious! I gave it a 1 out of 10 because you can't go any lower and the music really was quite good, but everything else, give this one a miss and wait for the UV code to come out - at least you won't waste as much money as 2 movie tickets, drinks, popcorn etc, and there's an OFF button on the ROKU, so you can switch this crapola off and just go have sex with your partner instead.",1,122,189,13 February 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A brilliant conclusion - but now what do I look forward to?
","If Peter Jackson doesn't win the best director and best picture Oscars this year, then there is NO JUSTICE at all in the entertainment industry - let's just hope the Golden Globes are a good indication!To start with, this movie is outstanding - there will be no spoilers in this review because you really have to go and see this film for yourself to appreciate the splendor and the spectacle of this epic tale of adventure, romance, nobility and heroism.Frodo is back as good as ever, and Elijah Wood is proving to be a really talented adult actor, following on from his excellent start in childhood. And as Sam, Sean Astin, is another child star who has really come into his own now.Viggo Mortensen is still gorgeous and makes a believable King, and the entrancing Liv Ullman is beautiful as the elf who gives up her immortality for love.New Zealand has now become one of the places I must visit, because it is just breathtaking and that is thanks to Peter Jackson's sensitive direction and the skill of the cinematographer and editor combined!This film deserves to be nominated for about 10-12 Oscars that I can think of - best film, director, original score, original song, a gaggle of special effects type awards, and if there were a best overall cast, it would definitely win that one.I cannot wait for this film to come out in the special edition triple boxed set later in 2004 - it will be a must-buy for Christmas 2004!You should see this film if you have seen the first 2 and if not rent them first, then see the ending, the impact is much better if you know what is going on.And for anyone who thinks 3 hours is a long time to be sat in a cinema, well, don't concern yourself, it will all be over before you even realize it and you'll wonder where the time went!",9,1,6,26 January 2004
