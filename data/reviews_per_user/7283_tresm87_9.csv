The Blair Witch Project," A foreboding and anxiety filled story that ultimately fizzles with a uneventful conclusion.
","5.6/10 This obviously caught the world by storm when it came out due to its fantastic marketing or trolling however you look at it. People thought this was all real footage and these people actually died at the hands of the Blair Witch. As a kid when this came out, this was truly an innovative film that captivated me with its creepy ominous wood setting and the fact i thought it might have been real. I was constantly searching the woods in hopes of finding things similar to in this film and it gave me great imagination in my exploring. However I had always held an almost angry feeling towards it for not actually ever showing the witch in the film. It led us all in this tense frenzy of psychological terror without ever giving us something to see. If they had just shown something in the final house seen or anything throughout it could've easily been a better film. Ive had a love hate relationship with this for a long time and i do appreciate its forboding and ominous setting and use of the documentary style camera work, but i still feel tricked ultimately by the gimmick and tease of the film. But for what it is it works on some levels, and the folklore and backstory of the blair witch is phenomenally well imagined. The new film as Ive said is superior because we finally get to see a visual portrayal of the witch and it was made with a higher budget allowing them to expand vastly on the plotting and effects. I will say the makers of this film are geniuses with the idea and they grossed a ton from it. Book of shadows was an absolute travesty though that shouldn't be viewed by anyone.",6,1,2,19 August 2018
Hereditary," A24 at it again with another scam
","A24 at it again with another well shot drama that isn't even close to being actual horror. They portray the trailers for all of their movies as these truly unnerving horrifying masterpieces and they are scams full of mediocre build up and no payoff. It's happened with the witch, it comes at night, and many other critically acclaimed borefests. Critics once again must be getting paid off to hail these as new age horror classics. I snuck into this film because I wasn't going to be robbed of my money like I was with the witch and it comes at night. A24 should be reported to the BBB for their fraudulent scams that are their film productions because the trailers and marketing constantly tell the consumers these are horror's. Also for the self proclaimed genius hipsters that claim this is 'art horror' and 'masterful', you are literally going along with the delusional idiotic critics to appear trendy and above the mainstream. Do not pay to watch A24 films.",5,5,13,10 June 2018
Aquaman," 8.4/10 James Wan has crafted the most visually magnificent and triumphant tale of the DCU, full of heartfelt emotion and genuine fun albeit ridiculous at times.
","Had someone ever told me I would enjoy an Aquaman film with Jason Momoa more than any film in the DCU, I wouldn't have believed them and laughed. The truth is imho this is the most effectively executed film of the extremely polarizing DCU, and is filled with an array of epic moments throughout, as well as a fantastic portrayal of the comic story. While it might stray away from comics in certain aspects, it thrives with its own distinct identity. The attention to detail from Wan is impeccable as usual and the visuals in this are mind blowing to say the least. The world building through the diversity of colors, environments, creature designs, costume designs, and the overall perspectives are spectacular. The CGI was heavily utilized but never looked cheap or unrefined and is some of the best work I've seen. The characters are all acted well besides Black Manta's character which I thought was a laughably bad performance though maybe it was just how his character was written. Momoa did well enough and was extremely fun to watch, but Patrick Wilson stole the show with an incredible role as King Orm and added a whole different dimension to the majestic story that I did not see coming. It's clear to see why James Wan casts him so much in his great films. I also thought Willem Dafoe did a fantastic job as Vulko and it was cool to see him once again in a comic adaptation. I did think some of the dialogue and forced comedy was hit or miss at times, and bordered on ridiculous to where i laughed in absurdity. There are some really oddly placed songs in the soundtrack that also add some laughable ridiculousness. Luckily the story thrived so much with its triumphantly heartfelt core and exciting high octane action, that some of the more cheesy parts can be overlooked. It's satisfying to see that Wan took the time, effort, and heart and broke away from tired formulas of the DCU for the most part, to procure an epic original adaptation that sets up a bright future. I just hope the Black Manta character/actor will improve, because if he will be the main villain, he will have to be more convincing and slightly better written. Overall this is a fantastic film that needs to be seen in theaters to truly savor the details and grand scapes.",8,6,10,21 December 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Worst Spider-Man film so far. Completely idiotic.
",Completely flabbergastingly overrated. It was essentially a teen/millennial comedy with forced pc agenda and horrendous unfunny dialogue. I mean look what they did with Mary Jane and Flash. Every time he was in his suit I was laughing at how terrible the cgi looked and Keaton was one of the least inspired villains I've ever seen and his cgi for his vulture character didn't help. Holland and this movie are mediocre in comparison to anything from the Toby/Andrew Spider-Man films. Honestly I'd take spider man 3 over this mess. Really hoping his appearance in Venom is short. Also they made the portrayal of the Shocker villain as 2 henchmen thugs with some alien technology that were around for a few min total . He was actually an awesome villain in the comics and cartoon and should've been utilized properly.,5,6,9,24 May 2018
Predator," A dynamic and influential timeless masterpiece from Thomas bros, McTiernan, Winston, Silvestri, and the greatest action cast of all time.
","In my honest opinion, this is the best film of all time. I think I was about 4 when i first watched it in 1991, and it has remained my favorite for its sheer visual creativity, visceral non stop action, purely macho legendary cast, and the single most brilliant creature design ever witnessed. The brilliant story of a technologically advanced yet savage alien that hunts for sport going up against the toughest and most dangerous commandos in the world is portrayed in astonishingly entertaining fashion throughout this classic. Director John McTiernan showcased his signature suspenseful action vision jam packed full of immensely executed sequences with outstanding camera work and excellent jungle landscapes/atmosphere. The larger than life characters played by Arnold, Ventura, Weathers, Duke, Landham, Black, Chaves, and Peter Hall (as the Predator) make up a once in a lifetime cast of legends that absolutely shine and engross the viewer in every frame they're in. The most integral and monumental aspect of this film comes from the production shift of having the early predator suit concept with Van Damme as the Alien, scrapped and shifted into bringing the creature effects mastermind Stan Winston on board designing the untouchably magnificent iconic Predator design. Still to this day the detail delivered into every facet of the alien creature's design is as vibrant and realistic as you can get and made the film what it was imo. When you first see the predator take his mask off and reveal his grotesquely unique face and vicious mouth, it's something that blows you away and stays with you forever. As a perfect compliment to all of the spellbinding visuals, we get a sonic work of art with Alan Silvestri's rambunctious pulse pounding score that elevates the entire experience to new heights as the thrills and shrills take place. Also you have to give credit to the FX team as they broke ground with some of the Pred technology features as far as the thermal vision sight, camouflage cloaking, glowing green blood, and the plasma explosions. In a time where effects were just being experimented with, these were advanced for the time. The overall production quality of this humble 18 million dollar budget film is astoundingly well executed. There is a reason this has become known as a classic (though still slightly underrated) over the past 20 years and appreciated for its massively inspiring timeless legacy.",10,2,2,2 September 2018
Bird Box," 5.4/10 More standard mediocre Netflix original content that consists of recycled concepts from other films, scattered plot points, and no payoffs for the constant build ups.
","There are so many obvious similarities in this film especially to 'The Happening' from 2008 as well as 'A Quiet Place' from earlier this year. When it does try to be it's own thing at times, it comes off so contrived and cliche and I personally couldn't take it seriously. There are so many tropes and moments that are so familiar and unoriginal. The story is told in a somewhat interesting way and Bullock's acting is serviceable like always but it just lacks an overall originality which has become a trend in most Netflix 'original' films unfortunately, aside from a few. I felt as though they tried to make this more of a testament/symbolism to being a mother than anything else and maybe that's why it's scoring so well among the average Netflix demographic. There are moments of set up atmosphere and intensity that never lead to anywhere where I guess you're supposed to use your imagination which I find pointless when watching something that is meant to show the culprits before your eyes in the thriller/horror genres. The suspense is empty when it's meant to be full. Overall this is just a long dragging attempt at being a clever thriller drama that doesn't deliver any originality but is watchable I suppose.
If you want quality original horror on Netflix, watch The Ritual or The Apostle.",5,46,112,22 December 2018
A Quiet Place," A suspenseful relentless ride that's legitimately scary
","9.6/10 A new age creature feature/Alien invasion horror drama that excels on nearly all levels. This has everything horror films need to have. A Quiet Place induces terrifying amounts of authentic tension and insane suspense, while visually horrifying the viewers through subtleties of atmosphere and brutally relentless imagery. The focus on sound is masterfully utilized and brought out the absolute best in the amazing cast through their emotionally brilliant acting. The unique creature design is THE best I've seen in a decade, and they are truly grotesquely magnificently portrayed with legitimately realistic cgi. I was afraid they wouldn't show them that much in the film, but they were prevalent and pulverizing in every frame they were in. In the end it does end pretty abruptly and you don't really get origins or explanations regarding the alien creatures but that's really my only nitpick. This is truly a new horror classic to behold and Krasinki is now at the forefront of great new directors and will be one to watch with his future ventures. If you want to see an actually scary and intense ride, you have to see this film.",9,4,9,6 April 2018
It Chapter Two," What should've been an excellent follow up to a tremendous first installment, devolves into a dragging mess of tones and miserable cgi with few redeeming factors.
","6.4/10 I absolutely adored the first film adaptation in 2017 and I'll be honest in saying the original tv movie adaptation was average at best imo. I was extremely excited for this chapter 2 film since the first came out with high hopes especially when the cast was revealed for the adult losers club. Now that I finally saw this new addition, i have to say I thought this was pretty ridiculous and an utter let down. While it has its decent moments revolving around some charming characters of the adult losers club, and a few interesting Pennywise scares, i found this to be bizarrely scattered, and at times dull. Story wise it's straightforward and very cliche with unbelievably stupid jump scares sprinkled into every 10 min with seriously some of the most laughable cgi you can imagine. Some of the concepts they thought up had to be attempts at comedy. There were some comedic elements in the first film but not during the scares as much. The tone is constantly clashing between extravagant scares and dumb jokes to where it is not coherent as a film. The cast saves this film and gives you a reason to care especially Bill Hader and James McAvoy. I felt Bill Skarsgard was underutilized massively in this and replaced with these mostly terrible cgi jumpscares. While the conclusion does have the same emotional connection as the first and the same high stakes, i couldn't help but feel like it was a missed opportunity overall. Maybe if we finally get that supercut there will be added scenes to rectify some of chapter 2's disappointment. Until then I'll stick with the first film.",6,1,2,23 November 2019
Annihilation," The epitome of style over substance. A pretentious mess.
","Quite underwhelming other than the visuals honestly, and the epitome of style over substance. Plotting was quite nonsensical and directionless.Some very hollow acting other than Portman and some extremly unnecessary sex flashbacks injected into the film for nothing but shock value. Tried to be way deeper than it was. The only truly exciting scene was in the house with the mutated bear. Both this film and ex machina had extremely misleading trailers making the appear to be sci/fi horror's and they were drawn out sci fi dramas that lacked anything remotely worthy of being hailed masterpieces. The whole supposed deeper message and symbolization interpretation that so many of these self proclaimed internet geniuses seem to have is quite funny and pretentious. This was a scattered mess with some really interests visuals which at times had some mediocre cgi.",5,0,2,3 August 2018
