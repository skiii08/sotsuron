Casablanca," Transit
","I can't see this one often enough.  Besides bringing back the team that made The Maltese Falcon and adding the unbelievable Ingrid Bergman at her most beautiful, Claude Raines as just the perfect corrupt slimeball bureaucrat Frenchy trading visas for sex with the cute wives of refugees and Conrad Viedt at his best creating the character upon which Colonel Klink was undoubtedly based.  Peter Lorre as a pathetic loser, Sidney Greenstreet is still 'The Fat Man' and Bogey is still the hard boiled realist.  The difference to the MF is that instead of a Dashiel Hammet derivative detective story, this one is based on themes from what was the classic story of the early years of Nazi history - the transit visa.  That was the holy grail that meant survival to millions who fled between 1932 and when the borders closed shortly after the fall of Paris.  From this perspective, Ricks actions can be seen not so much as noble self denial but the hard reality that in such times the problems of two lovers 'don't amount to a hill of beans.'",10,1,1,8 November 1999
Chinatown," Just one little flaw
","A hard boiled detective gets involved in a morbid tale of power corruption, murder and a dirty little family secret -- just one little flaw in the lady's eye - the left one. I wouldn't put it in my top 20, but without a doubt in my top 100.  It's one of the few Hollywood detective stories that I not only can sit through but can watch several times.  My theory is that good detective movies come around about every 20-30 years. Think about it: Maltese Falcon 1941, Chinatown 1974 and LA Confidential 1997.  They all share great actors, great directors and great writers.  It's no coincidence that John Huston directed the first and stars in the second, and that the hero of the second is Jake, while the hero of the third is named Jack.Joe Bob Briggs Memorial Academy Award Nomination for Jake's answer to the cop who asked him what happened to his nose: 'Your wife got a little excited and crossed her legs.'",10,2,3,8 November 1999
Barry Lyndon," Bildingsroman - The development of Character
","I was sitting drinking with a friend one night talking about movies, art and literature after a Werner Herzog Q&A following the premiere of his 'Little Dieter wants to Fly' at the Roxie when the topic of Stanley Kubrik came up. We both instantly agreed he belongs in the pantheon of the movie gods.'What's your favorite Kubrik movie' he asked.'I know all the Kubrik fans and the critics hated it, but for me it's Barry Lyndon hands down.' I replied.Long story slightly shortened, he agreed wholeheartedly and pulled out a copy from his shelf saying, 'It's the only one I own.' Most people are Kubrik fans for the spectacle of the extreme from films like Clockwork Orange and 2001 - brilliant in their own right - but never get beyond that to the essence of Kubrik - Character Development. Yeah I know, it's the bla bla bla the critics whine about being missing all the time, but that's what makes a movie, not the exploding cars.Barry Lyndon is all about the development of the character of a country Casanova becoming a lord and how his times shaped his character, much in the same way Clockwork Orange is about how language shapes our character.The Bildungsroman - or Character Development Novel - is most often cited as a German development attributed to Goethe and supposedly culminating with Thomas Mann, but the focus on the development of regular people was the major theme of 19th Century European Literature from Stendahlto Dostoyevsky all the way back as far as I can trace it to Shakespeare, Homer or the stories of Cuchullain - and most certainly Thackery and his contemporaries from Charles Dickens to Jane Austin.From Path's to Glory, Spartacus, on to the his last Kubrik is all about character -- even 2001 is strictly focused on the development of human character from the screeching ape to the dying aristocrat in his bed. (When even the development of a computer's character is a theme we are really expected to get the picture of what this is all about.) But he took it to the limit with this one, focusing over three hours on character and boring the action junkies, who were still on the Clockwork Orange horrorshow high, to death. But for myself and for many others this one is his greatest masterpieces because of that focus on character development. I would really like to see a previous poster explain what contemporary have film plots less 'thin' than this.",10,1,4,9 September 2005
Full Metal Jacket," Objectification of the Individual
","Marines are not drafted.  One must volunteer to get in. So these characters wanted to be part of the best killing machine for whatever reason.  I am gratified to read here that real Marines commend the real nature of the depiction.  The Boot Camp Sergeant is real, as is the blanket party.  The men must be stripped of any ego and humanity in order to survive war intact as a unit.  I've said it before and I'll say it again -- Great Literature about war is about Objectification of the Individual -- Go ahead and re-read Achilles' treatment of Hector's body in the Illiad if you have any questions.  This movie makes that point with its two halves.  Just think about how each character dealt with Boot Camp and then the War.  And for fans of Private Ryan I challenge you to compare the sniper scenes in the two movies!  The former makes it a sad scene, this movie makes it a real life horror nightmare akin to the surreal bridge sniper scene in Apocalypse Now.  Deer Hunter gives you before and after, FMJ gives you some glimpse into the how and why.A masterpiece for any director, but seemingly a disappointment for those who expected -- what? -- from this one.  Glitz?  Dream sequences?  A music video?  No it's real Kubrick allright. It explores the individual in the context of the environment and how that makes and changes the individual. And very nicely displays the effect on every single character from the soldiers to the hookers and the enemy.",10,0,0,10 November 1999
Being John Malkovich," Laugh out loud with the rest of the audience
","Saw this one Sunday Night late show in Santa Cruz and felt free to laugh out loud at every joke I got, and take the hints from the audience that split a gut at every joke they got. I haven't laughed this much at a movie since .... Puppet master performs Abelard and Heloise!!! Gets a 'straight' job filing in the 7 1/2 th floor, finds portal into JM's brain. Has crush on evil manipulative witch who talks him into charging admission (she treats customers like a $200 hooker!)OK you get 15 miniutes of fame, but you get to experience it through a real life celebrity!  Morality tales, examination of the Id and Ego, boundries of the individual, all that is there to think about afterwards, but while watching you'll be too busy laughing.Warning:  do not try to explain the plotline to anyone whohasn't seen it.  They will think you're crazy and no one would believe it anyway.",Null,0,0,15 November 1999
Man on the Moon," sweet sappy holly woody that would make andy upchucky
","Let me start by saying that I do not regret seeing this movie, nor would I recommend against it -- especially those who thought  that Andy Kaufman really was a sexist pig who wrestled women to  prove men were superior.  But fans of his humor will be disappointed.  I must also say that I have not liked most of Carey's humor with the lone exception of 'The Mask' -- he does manage to pull off AK as well as anyone could have.This was a real hollywoodizationalization that tries to 'humanize' AK for those who 'misunderstood' his humor.  Anyone who took his macho wrestling against women stuff seriously should see this movie and be 'educated.'  Just like anyone who thinks the pro wrestling fights in the parking lot are real should talk to his or her daddy or mommy.
I remember almost wetting my pants during the real letterman 'fight' when the 'insulted pro wrestler' decked AK whose neck he had 'cracked' in the ring with a 'piledriver'.  Dave's reenactment was less than genuine -- i remember him pulling off his 'fearful' routine far better in the original -- kissing up to Lawler.  That was part of what made the whole routing funny then, it was decidedly less funny in this movie.  Thinking about it I have to agree with many viewers' impression that this thing looks like it was hacked up by some standard brand studio editing.Like a pro wrestler, andy made us believe his characters while this movie tries to make a larger audience that never liked or even had a clue as to the humor in his routines 'like Andy'.A nice homage, I would have preferred less sap and more AK spirit -- like trying to convince us his death was staged -- that would have Andy Kaufman smile. I think those sightings of Elvis in the Supermarkets are really Andy Kaufman's ghost having one more laugh at us all.",8,0,0,10 January 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Posta B D-sturbing
","Art and Language shape the people.  Or that at least seems to be the theme of the Burgess book, as far as I was able to read it.  And in the background of the Moloko Milk Bar we have the language of the 70's in psychedelic script listing the plusses in Moloko+ (psylocybin, mescaline, LSD...)  It's no surprise then that Alec's antagonists are the drunken wino and the wine sipping liberal. Well well well me droogie. The  'orrorshow seems to somehow feel 'orrible.  What a concept.  And here I thought rape and murder were supposed to be titillating and amusing.  Nothing is real.... To put it in historical perspective, the same year saw a film by Sam Peckinpah - Straw Dogs.  Both show a society grown used to horror, and the effect on the populace.  And what do we do about it?  Brainwashing?  Fight horror with horror?  Kill them all and let god sort out the guilty?",Null,0,0,8 November 1999
Stalingrad," His name was Meier, like so many others
","Since the Illiad, the theme of warfare epics is the objectification of the individual.  This one meets that requirement by making the viewer get to know a bunch of regular guys, moving from the stereotype hotshots pumped from their easy victories to just trying to survive a desperately hopeless situation.  And like so many (good) war movies, it shows how coming to terms with mortality can strip the bs away and let an individual be real.   As to accuracy - the friend who dragged me into it despite my distaste for blockbusters - noted that they even had the different boot height of the officers vs enlisted men right. The insanity of those extra two inches of leather becomes magnified when the starving soldiers find the 'officers' club.' That kind of subtlety is nice in a movie.  It makes the point without treating the audience like idiots. Take a hint from the theater in which I saw it and start the air conditioning ever lower during the last half hour. See it in a good theater for maximum impact of the thunderous sound and blinding vision.",Null,0,0,8 November 1999
Mystic River," There are two kinds of movies audiences
","One wants to escape into a pretend world.The other wants to see stories that make them think about theirs.This movie is for the latter, the former will be sorely disappointed.What looks from the onset like an unfortunate sequence of personal tragedies intended to tug on the sympathetic heartstrings of the former begins to wear thin and tedious about half way through as the all too obvious tragic outcome begins to roll downhill like a snowball gathering momentum.But like a well constructed drama the denouement (thats the comedown after the climax where the meaning of the whole thing gets explained) hits first like a splash of cold water and then delivers the blow to the gut that left me reeling with recognition.Not too many movies out of Hollywood lately have hit with that much moral force AFTER the ostensible climax. Usually you get some lamers making some clichÃ©s pretending to explain what needed no explanation because it was all too trite from the beginning. This one actually set off the old light bulb with the 'Oh THAT'S what the storyteller was trying to get at with this story!'This story tries to make similar moral judgments about ancient ingrained traditions of morality and justice in a microcosm of 3 families that Scorcese tried to portray in Gangs of New York on the grand scale.",10,5,10,20 December 2004
The Deer Hunter," Not a great Vietnam movie, a great portrait of Americans
","I've seen Deer Hunter twice since I saw it in first run, and I liked it.  It doesn't compare to Apocalypse now, which had a much broader focus, nor to Full Metal Jacket, which was more about individual psychology.  I dismiss Platoon as a standard brand war movie.  Like FMJ, this one has that long opening to contrast normal life for these characters, to what their subsequent experience turned them into.  These are no pacifist whimps.  No, they like shooting and killing for sport.  But after their experiences one comes home to be a peaceful thoughtful husband while the other stays behind as a suicidal junkie with a death wish who plays russian roulette for money. Why?  How do they resolve this?  Every war since recorded history has left its shells of homeless beggars and lost souls in the countryside, heck Ulysses wandered for twenty years.  This film is one of the few that attempts to explore this from the perspective of two archetypical American male stereotypes.Not the most amusing or moving entertainment, but a must see for anyone into historical films that make any attempt to gain insight into what war does to the human soul.  (This should also be the perspective from which we should see the portrayal of 'The Enemy.')",8,1,2,10 November 1999
Contact," It all makes sense, now that we know what Carl was smoking.
","I didn't want to see another romanticized alien movie like the oen where Jaws-boy goes crazy and builds volcanos in his dining room out of mashed potatoes so I skipped this one in general release.  But when I saw it on cable a few weeks ago, I even sat through it a second time, and didn't channel surf once. It was captivating.  Much more scientific reality that the X-tremely weird little green men stuff.  It was a touching testimonial to modern scientific knowledge.  Maybe Einstein was wrong and God does play dice.  The probabilities are in favor of this movie.  But the contact would have to be many light years further away and hence a few centuries for the round trip. The transport mode depicted is the only scientific possibility for these distances...but I thought time would condense ?",Null,0,1,10 November 1999
