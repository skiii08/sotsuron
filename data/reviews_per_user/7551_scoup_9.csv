Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Can't quite put my finger on why I disliked it
","This is very odd. On the surface, this movie has all the requisite elements of good movie: nice sets with detail, mood, cast, sharp dialog, surprise death, action, fight scenes, etc...So how did it go wrong??? Here's how I felt - like I knew what was coming; but even though I did not it still seemed contrived and stale. I felt somewhat mocked by this movie, like the original was such a success that there was no need to put forth real effort to make it special. it was a boring string of events in a patent formula...............witty remark, somber condescending look, conflict, clever overreaching resolution, pepper with fisticuffs, witty remark, pretend self-destructive narcissistic behavior is cute. Then lather rinse and repeat throughout movie.kudos for the early death of Amy McAdams. She's decent but that opening scene with the package was beat. It was like watching two lovebirds on the phone going, 'you hang up....no you hang up,no you hang up.....OK I'm gonna hang up, I know you didn't hang up...you hang up' ad nauseam.......... heavy on the nauseam.We get it already, Sherlock is so clever that he knows what everyone does before they do it. Oh wait, he actually admits that he made a mistake....hey viewers see his flaw, doesn't that make him more human and relatable???? Nope.Of course we know he did not die at the end - why? Because he's too clever for dying.PS - Watson's wife is a bore.",4,5,8,6 June 2012
The Girl Next Door," Went into this not expecting too much, but...
","The Girl Next Door is now a favorite movie in the teen genre.Initially I was going to rate this a 7 but there are great plot twists that sneak up on you just when you think you know where it is going; so in all fairness this movie gets the 8 for not standing idly in cliché land.Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant gel nicely as the leads. There were many laugh out loud moments including the AVN convention and the prom, but the awards dinner was possibly the best (tie scene and dancing).While Emile and Elisha produce good chemistry and provide the plot foundation, it is the antagonistic relationship between Emile (Matt) and Timothy (Kelly) that keep you loving this movie. I could watch another movie based on these two alone.The supporting cast of nerd friends serve the film well and provide excellent comedic relief.On pondering what changes would make this movie rate as 9-10, I am still unsure because pushing the boundaries further might also push the movie too far across the absurdity line. However The Hangover was absurd and that was great fun, so I'll stick with the rating of 8.It's unfair to label this movie as just a teen comedy because its got more juice and more squeeze than most.",8,4,5,19 March 2012
The Machinist," Great thriller mystery
",The Machinist is an instant classic. A riveting descent into madness with Christian Bale bringing his A game. Bale wastes himself away to 120 lbs of a haunting and creepy shell of a man both visually disturbing and compelling. The story ambles along laden with foreshadowing and clues keeping the viewer involved in the mystery.Not much needs to be said except 'Brilliant.' Well constructed and nuanced atmospheric film that will be viewed 50 years from now and not lose anything; maybe only to be elevated as an example of filmmaking at its best.It's easy to draw a parallel to Hitchcock; but maybe it is closer to the truth that The Machinist is a movie that he would have evolved to make if he had lived longer. Hitchcock would have been fascinated by Bale and his extreme dedication to his craft. My imagination takes me away to a place where Hitchcock has just finished watching The Machinist and feels just a small pang of envy...followed by an immediate call to Bale's agent for casting in his next movie. If wishes were horses...,10,7,9,4 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Very disappointing...
","I'm not sure how anyone rated this movie over a 7. Maybe someone who who hasn't seen another Spiderman movie or a teenager could think it's great, but rest assured it is NOT.Green Lantern was bad and I gave it a 6, but I'm giving this a 5 because it's a reboot and did not need to be done. There are plenty of good writers so there is no excuse for the poor script.Spiderman was boring and unoriginal. My mind wondered throughout the movie due to lack of empathy for the characters and plodding pace. I was more interested in my own thoughts of imagining how Christopher Nolan would have done the reboot and how much better it would have been - what a pity.Here are my gripes: Costume was bad (at least Green Lantern had a cool suit); subway scene was dumb - Parker immediately gets powers with no real bodily effects and putting a cold beer bottle with weight on his forehead doesn't awaken him, but a DROP of beer jolts him to the subway roof - laughable, cue my eye-roll - and where was the Spidey sense????;Uncle Ben's death was not as emotionally affective as it should have been. Aunt May just seemed off - 2002 Aunt May all the way; Dr. Connors was mishandled and boring - i do not buy that his motivation for trying the serum is the threat of being fired; he lost his arm and wants to be whole; Denis Leary - underutilized and needed more screen time; bad move killing him off because he was the one person I would have liked to see in a sequel; Mask - why is he always taking his mask off??? This seems out of character and reckless. Any retard knows to keep your identity a secret - and Parker is a genius, right? He can build web slingers and solve the formula problem that dozens of scientists have been working on, but he can't make a mask to keep on his face?; Bridge rescue - clichéd and no dramatic tension (glad to see Jim Halsey and was thankful for the distraction of remembering how much I liked The Hitcher. Five minutes of that movie had more drama and tension than the entire Spiderman movie); Crane scene - contrived, forced and just ridiculous; love story - not even remotely developed; Parker does not go to the funeral when her dad dies??? The man who let him go??? No way. They did not look like teenagers - too old; $10 minimum spend to take a penny - pathetic script writing which should have been cut; Hype about movie being darker and Parker wittier - epic fail. They should have gotten a script doctor from Iron Man to give it look.Spider Bite - his father's research work is the basis for the genetically mutated spiders, but Parker does internet search for information????????? Not look at his father's work??? Because when I look for cutting edge research information on secretive work worth millions of dollars which gives me superhuman powers, I go right to the internet...and ignore the work that cost my father his life;Music - atrocious. You know it's bad when you you are actually thinking about it - normally music should be seamless in the movie and on all too rare occasions does the viewer encounter beautiful scores. I had to look it up and James Horner who won awards for Titanic and Avatar is listed. I guess you can't win them all, mediocrity would have been a step up; CGI - ehhh; CGI Hulk in Avengers was good, nothing stood out here; Gwen in closet - spray can of fire to scare off mutant lizard with regenerative powers and superhuman strength??? Conclusion: Disappointing movie that should have been better from a reviewer who is not a fan boy of Raimi. Examples of movies that did it better are Batman, Iron Man and Hulk (Norton, but there is room for improvement here). Clearly there will be a sequel because the studio is making a lot of money - they need to regroup and produce something better.I am anxiously awaiting the Hulk reboot with Ruffalo and hope it is better than The Amazing Spiderman.",5,8,16,10 July 2012
Batman Begins," The best Batman interpretation ever...
","Hollywood has finally gotten it right - a dark brooding Batman with wit and intelligence that is not a caricature of himself.Christopher Nolan is a master of story telling. I wanted to see how Batman evolved into the ominous crusader instead of the glossed over version spoon fed to viewers which goes something like this: He saw his parents die, so now he fights crime (insert cartoon villain next).Christian Bale was fantastic. Michael Cain - fantastic. Gary Oldman - fantastic. Cillian Murphy - fantastic. Liam Neeson - fantastic.Biggest movie fault - Katie Holmes as Rachel. No chemistry and kind of whiny.Batman Begins is nothing short of excellent.",10,0,1,19 March 2012
Pi," Conflicting emotions on this movie
","Pi begins with an interesting premise that brings excitement – solving a mathematical puzzle which has extensive implications financially, socially and spiritually. But this might just be its downfall. How can the movie resolve this incredible task and satisfy the audience? To dangle such a prize before us and not deliver leaves the viewer with a little resentment.Storyline follows a genius and his mentor in pursuit of the 216 digit solution to a puzzle. Drugs and mental illness are a backdrop. He does figure it out and even states that he is the chosen one to receive this information because he is the only one able to understand it (syntax). Yet he ultimately is overwhelmed by it and chooses an extreme course of action to rid himself of this knowledge which can change the world. Bummer to the rest of us struggling to find the meaning of life and find 'God.' Filmwork was interesting with lots of camera angles and editing. Sometimes the sounds were too piercing and unnecessary to get the message to viewers. I began to tire with the poking of the brain which showed up everywhere. More interaction with his mentor would have been appreciated as they worked well together and moved the story along. The mathematical theories and explanations were very short and offer the viewer no real additional knowledge or insight (at least to most individuals who have some form of higher education). I would have been open to an introduction of some new/different hypothesis even if it seemed far-fetched.Decent film, but not one I would get excited when I knew it was on TV again; more of a study of art and filmmaking.",6,1,2,4 April 2012
The Dark Knight," Masterpiece - 11 out of 10
","Surpasses Batman Begins.Anyone who rates this under a 5 has issues. Now onto the review...Let me begin by saying that I did not watch this movie until months after The Oscars and Heath Ledger's posthumous win which I assumed his death had been a major contributing factor. WAS I EVER WRONG - My apologies. Heath Ledger stole every scene he was in and brought depth and excitement to The Joker like none before him. Outside of the Batman universe, Heath's portrayal of the Joker is easily a top villain. As the movie credits rolled, a profound sorrow overcame me and I was ashamed of the selfishness I felt because this Joker would never again delight me. I mourned a second time.The script is excellent and full of great character interactions. As usual, top notch acting straight across.If I was pressed to find fault, I concur that Bale's voice change as Batman is not optimal; but this is really nit-picking because there is not much leeway as far as voice modulation goes and I'm sure he wanted to deviate from his predecessors.The Dark Knight Rises is so wonderful that I fear for its part three sequel because I can't imagine anything better. However, if there is one person that could accomplish this, it is Christopher Nolan. I hope he makes me eat my words.",10,2,5,19 March 2012
Love Actually," Would have turned it off, but...
","I wanted to be able to write a review on how utterly bad this movie was and especially considering the impressive cast.Love actually is all around us is what the film opens with. Then proceeds to try and pull the wool over our eyes by showing stories mostly consisting of lust, immaturity, misogyny, and stupid self-indulgence.A maid who doesn't speak his language takes her clothes off and has a tramp stamp – all that is needed for true love for writer whose wife cheated on him. Spends 3 seconds at his family's house at Christmas but leaves to be with the maid and propose marriage when they haven't even had a real conversation.Prime Minister who disses American President because he kisses girl that works in the office from the wrong side of the tracks.; they call her chubby, which she clearly isn't; then he 'redistributes her' from the office. But he dances around like Tom Cruise so isn't he cute and relatablenot. Gets a Christmas card and goes to find her door to door (100 of them); because the Prime Minister clearly has no one who could get her address in 3 seconds flat.Wife who just got married has an affair with photographer friend of her husband. But don't worry about her, she remarks how pretty she looks in the video.Boring wife and husband with young coworker woman sexually attracted to him. She figures out he is cheating with chick 20 years younger.Hideous plot line about a widower who just buried his wife and is worried about his son's behavior. The kid's terrible problem is that he is in love – his is like 8 yrs old and this is his focus. No sadness at Christmas missing his dead mom, just playing drums to get the attention of a girl; staring at her creepily. Encourage your 8 yr old to ignore security and run around alone in the airport - what an awesome dad. I found the kid to be an evil troll after this movie without any crying for his mother. He will grow up to be an uncaring vapid adult.Old weird has-been singer trying to make a comeback.whatever. Bored.Weirdo 2 – going to America to get laid. Gets lucky his first night in America with 4 hot chicks who take a stranger home and have an orgy.see true love. 'Love' is actually all around us y'all. Remember the beginning of the movie told us.Naked movie stand-in couple – just for the nudity obviously.The only story I cared about was Laura Linney who had feelings for her coworker and everyone knew it. She had a special needs brother that needed attention. She was absent from the ending – what a waste.Ending – everyone hugging at the airport – because you know, when I think of the airport, the first thing I associate with it is hugging happy people.",1,6,11,1 June 2012
Scream," What is my favorite scary movie?
","Scream. Although Scream 4 is right along side it.Scream is probably the benchmark to all scary movies of the last couple generations - and rightfully so. With a brilliant combination of horror, comedy, satire, mystery and thrills, movie history was made and slasher films were elevated to a new level.With an all around terrific cast, witty dialog, character awareness of the 'rules' of horror movies, plot twists and entertaining antagonists, viewers will never be disappointed.Iconic: The opening scene with Drew Barrymore on the telephone with Ghostface is the equivalent to the shower scene in Psycho.",10,3,3,19 March 2012
