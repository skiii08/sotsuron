Conquest 1453," Good film, but would have preferred a less religious aspect!
","This is truly a remarkable bit of film making, particularly the special effects, acting and panoramic scenery. The screenplay too was outstanding, Hollywood should seriously take into consideration the new up and coming Turkish directors and their big ideas in both its major films and Soups in today's Turkey – much has changed since those years in the 1970s. In saying all that and getting them off my chest, now for the real review. Everyone knows how powerful the Ottoman Empire was and that it conquered Istanbul, which is why I didn't really enjoy the parts with the reference to religion in battle, particularly on the battlefield itself – why was that included more than once? The film could have been better laid out in terms of explaining the military techniques the Ottomans used on the battlefield itself, Mehmet's passion for the Arts of the Western world and how he thought hard to preserve the new conquered city's heritage by naming it 'Istanbul' which means 'The City' in Byzantium language – which many people do not know. Mehmet also had more than a few wives and not just only one, and from various backgrounds including a Greek wife. Mehmet was definitely a very interesting person in real life and had more to him apart form only wanting to conquer Constantinople.",9,1,4,28 November 2013
Man of Steel," A very good come back!
","I have given this a strong 7/10 as, although it ticked all the boxes in terms of action and casting, it could have done with a bit more of that old Christopher Reeves charisma and charm to complete the film - but I am guessing that will be in the next film as he becomes Clarke Kent at the end! I blame the director for wanting more action and not the lead character. Regardless, Henry Cavil is definitely the right man for the job. He not only looks like the former 1978 Superman star, but is a very good actor too! His American Ascent over his native British ascent is almost unnoticeable, while he certainly brought in a new, real dimension to the role. I would definitely put this at the top of my action/superhero films and hop that the lead character remains for many more sequels to come!",7,2,4,28 November 2013
The Theory of Everything," A Great film!
","A biopic of Stephen Hawking, in my opinion, was always bound to be of good quality due to his amazing achievements in the evolution of science. This film, from it's inception, just pulled me in. The way in which the characters were professionally played, its touching on 1963 Cambridge, and its overall style was a real pleasure to witness. What firmly sat my bottom to the seat though was how the film makers made the film believable in almost all aspects of the movie; its characters, theme, language, education, success and portrayal of Stephen's failures, It felt as if each stage of the film was its own mini-series gradually developing into one complete element of great film making. Well Done!",9,2,3,26 January 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Another Excellent film by the great Mel Gibson!
","I was completely blown away by this movie, but quite frankly I am not surprised as Mel Gibson has produced some amazing films in recent years. The acting was sensational, a very well acted depiction of the true events concerning the Hacksaw campaign. Andrew Garfield played this role so seamlessly that I almost forgot he had played in the Amazing Spiderman only a few years ago. It's clear that his credentials as a very diverse actor is amongst the best young actors on the big screen. Vince Vaughan and the other around him should also be commended for such great performances. I was pleasantly surprised. I would strongly recommend anyone watching this film. Well done to all involved!",10,1,2,10 May 2017
