"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Some of the Best One-liners in Film!
",Some of the best one-liners in a film... Difficult to quote only one or two here.. Terence Stamp is brilliant! Guy Pearce's superb performance is one of the many that will follow from this remarkable actor. I have seen this film many times and always catch something new & 'laugh out loud' funny that I had not noticed before... The costumes are beyond extraordinary - a well deserved Oscar!,10,1,2,6 August 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Powerful!
",This movie has got to be one of the all time Great War Films.. The realism and the newsreel style provided a powerful cold sweat effect.. The only thing missing was the sea spray and the smells of WAR. I am sure that will be next.,10,0,0,22 May 2000
