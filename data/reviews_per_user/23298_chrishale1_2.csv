Deja Vu," You should all be ashamed
","I came to IMDb after seeing this movie hoping to be told that it was a farce, and meant to be a campy action flick. I'm not sure what writers get paid these days but obviously not as much as the special effects guys. Who needs a good story anyway? This one was more likely to appear on Days of Our Lives than the big screen. Clumsy, awkward, forced, contrived, devoid of pretty much any redeeming quality unless you can wear ear plugs and watch the movie purely for the special effects. By the end of the movie I was laughing out loud at the ridiculous plot developments and had several times convinced the two people I was with (a man and woman 25-35) to stick through the movie in hopes there was a redeeming ending. I was disappointed that I indeed had wasted another Sunday afternoon watching an over-budgeted mess.",2,20,41,27 November 2006
Burn After Reading," Fun Movie
","Saw this with my 50-year-old mom and it had us both laughing. Took a while to get started but once the plot got going, the movie's tongue-in-cheek humor had the theater splitting a gut. Brad Pitt was the most memorable character in the movie, stole every scene he was in - I just wish there were more of them! George Clooney could have done more with his character. He seemed to play a rather flat cheating husband, without really giving us his motivation. Malkovich was his typical brilliant self, and I found myself feeling sorry for him, until the end of the film of course. The Coen Brothers' ability to move between a dark movie like 'No Country...' to a smart, funny movie like this says a lot about their skill as filmmakers, and is the reason why people will go see their movies no matter the genre. They're guaranteed winners.",8,9,18,12 September 2008
