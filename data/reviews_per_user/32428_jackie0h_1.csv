Requiem for a Dream," Excellent!
","I LOVED this movie. It was excellent.  The filming techniques were wonderful. The acting was superb. I can't say enough good things about it. This IS a must-see. Everyone in this film did a wonderful job! I was especially pleased with Marlon Wayans.  He proved he that as a comedian, he can still act in a dramatic role.",10,0,0,2 September 2001
