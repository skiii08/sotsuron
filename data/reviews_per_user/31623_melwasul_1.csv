United 93," Non-creative?
","Before the movie got released I thought it was too early to make a 9/11 movie. So I didn't expect the movie to be great before I watched the movie. When I expect nothing, I should get something great, right?But no! I didn't get something great.It was a long and boring movie. Mainly it happens in the flight centrals in different cities where they talk about what happened to the planes. Why should the people find dialogs in the flight centrals interesting?Though the boring movie, I found TWO scenes ONLY thats good for me. These scenes was the scene of the second airplane-crash on WTC and the scene of the end. Or else nothing good or interesting in the movie.Just by the end of the movie, it appears 4-5 pages with text that tells what happened on the day. I was like 'what the...'. Movie is meant to be visual, not like a book.I gotta say something to the director. Get more visual! And by the word 'visual', I didn't mean stuff like action, shooting or explosion. But September 11th happened too much to make a movie in flight central and United 93 only. There's a lot more stuff around 9/11 to put in the movie, but the director did not.What a lazy non-creative director! You gotta pay me back!",3,2,6,22 September 2006
