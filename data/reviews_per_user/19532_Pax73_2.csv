The Blair Witch Project," Fear of Dark
","I think the ones who didn't like this film don't have any imagination or expected too much from it.It's my opinion that TBWP is absolutely the most original horror film of last 20 years.Released with few dollars and many ideas this movie is able to give you a sense of fear from first frame to the last,but only if you accept to be caught into the wood with the three poor students,in this case it's impossible to not be involved in their nightmare.The amazing idea of the movie is to erase every cliche'of horror films,avoiding to show monsters,or 'gore' scenes,and the fear comes out from this ..Actually you never see what is really happening but you know that is the most horrible thing possible and the desperate screams of the girl are not easy to forget .This film is the fear of the dark,the fear of the darkest corner of our room into the night,it touches us deeply inside our most ancient fears..fear to be alone and helpless even in the society of mobiles and internet..,fear of the horrible witch that our grandmothers told to scare us And who cares if the whole story is invented ? it works! a scary movie must be scaring and this movie reach this target..after seen it I think you won't go for a picnic in the wood for a long time..",7,1,2,10 November 2000
Groundhog Day," Well done Phil!
","Phil Connors,a sarcastic weather man disappointed from his boring life the 2nd of February of every year goes to a lost little city in Pennsilvanya to shoot a reportage about an old local tradition 'The Groundhog day',where a nice big rat,like Phil calls it,seems able to preview the last of the winter and the came of the spring..but this time something of really strange happens,Phil ,for a joke of the destiny (or who knows what else..)is obliged to live the same day for hundred of times ,so every day ,for his desperation,he's woke up at 6:00 am by the same song at the radio and meets always the same people who obviously don't realize what is going on and can't understand his drama. I think this one the best comedy of the 90s not only for the Brilliant performance of Bill Murray (absolutely perfect in this role)but in particular for the deeper meaning of the story. In fact Phil's life is a disaster he's selfish,presumptuous, cinic and only when he changes his nature,stopping to use this absurd situation for his goals ,things will be better for him and the 2nd of February finally will be the 3rd!.So knowing perfectly the things of the day he's forced to live ever he starts helping people : save a child who's falling form a tree,save a man hit by an heart attack and so on in this way he also conquest the woman of his dreams (Andy McDowell).So this film is  a metaphor.Each of us after all live always the same day (wake at the same time,make the same job,see the same people)without realizing it,maybe we should make like Phil and try to change ,even just a bit,to be better person and to feel better ,is it so difficult ?..",7,0,0,27 November 2000
