The Incredible Hulk," I never read the comics to any Marvel Movie so the MCU is my very first taste of the superheroes!!
","When this came out in 2008 I was only 10 years old. I don't even think that I saw it until my Freshman year of High School. My initial reaction to it was, really that's it? 11 years later I am now 21 and I have seen every Marvel movie besides a select few. I recently just bought MCU Phase 1. I decided to give The Incredible Hulk another chance, while I still see some negative points to the movie. its not even that its a bad movie its just that compared to the other marvel movies it doesn't compete on the same level. For one and probably the biggest thing anyone will point out is that 'Bruce Banner' in this one is not the same Bruce Banner in The Avengers.The Incredible Hulk does have a huge backstory and origin for this hero this character, but how can they explain the fact that two to three years later when The first Avengers movie came out why is there a new actor as 'Bruce Banner.'The second time watching this definitely opened my eyes to the fact that overall this is still an amazing movie just not to the standard of the other Marvel movies that I have a huge love for.",7,1,1,22 April 2019
