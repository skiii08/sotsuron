Catch Me If You Can," Excellent
","This is the first great movie I've seen in a really long time. It had me hooked from the very opening, the little animated opening credits were really cool. The movie was a little long and you really notice it once (*spoiler*) they return from France, but it's really important to the story and I think Spielberg did an awesome job of entertaining us the entire way through. It was just a really cool movie with a lot of emotion, some great comic bits, and it made Frank W. Abagnale a hero to everyone in my theater. I give it 9/10.",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
