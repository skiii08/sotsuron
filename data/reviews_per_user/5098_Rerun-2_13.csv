The Blair Witch Project," Supremely effective horror movie
","'The Blair Witch Project' is one of the most terrifying and effective horror movies I have ever seen, hands-down.  It is not scary because it throws lots of gory, expensive special effects at us, or had characters who do idiotic things like walk into a house occupied by a chainsaw-wielding madman or hide in the closet when a killer is stalking them.  It is scary because of what it doesn't show us, because it knows that the things that make the noises in the night are never as frightening as the noises themselves.I guess the term 'horror movie' isn't quite right for this film.  That is better reserved for the kind of movie I have described above.  This is more like an experiment in fear, in tapping the nameless dread we feel when we hear...something...moving around in the darkness outside our flimsy tent. When you are lost, and just can't find your way back.  Those are fears I can relate to.  I think almost anyone can.  'Horror movies' place characters in implausible situations, so we can distance ourselves from the action. 'Blair Witch' draws us further in, so we are fascinated even as we can barely stand to watch.The movie's setup involves three student filmmakers who gather in the little Maryland town of Burkittsville to shoot a documentary about a witch that used to live in the woods at its borders.  They never return, and their footage is found a year later.  The 'movie' consists of the footage pieced together in chronological order to show what happened.They interview several people about the witch; some are ambivalent, some disbelieving.  The conversations are believable and not contrived; they are like something you would see in a documentary.  They are also a warning, although the students do see it as such (one woman is asked if she believes in the Blair Witch, and she grins and replies 'I believe it enough not to go up there.')They head into the woods to shoot footage of famous places in the witch legend, where unspeakable horrors were visited upon children and hunters. Gradually, things begin to get ominous.  Strange piles of stone turn up outside their tent.  At night, they can hear the noises of something moving around, something that refuses to show itself.  At one point, they stumble across a grove filled with bizarre, frightening stick figures, which hang from trees, twisting silently in the breeze.They plan to spend only a weekend there, but the map disappears, and they appear to be going in circles.  They are out of food, and worse, cigarettes. Every night they are harrassed by whatever is stalking them.  Heather, the project leader, tries to maintain order but the cameraman, Josh, and sound man, Mike, begin to question her ability to get them out of the woods, leading to gender struggles and a gradual breakdown of nerves.  I have been in situations like this, although far less dire, and people generally behave as these students do.This is not a movie where things jump out at them in from dark corners or where gore and slime drips all over the screen.  It is presented as a documentary, in a simple, realistic fashion, but with the growing realization that the characters are being hunted by supernatural forces. At first they react by simply not believing it; they seek rational explanations ('Did you ever see 'Deliverance'?' asks Josh, suggesting they are being preyed upon by unwelcoming locals).  Soon scientific postulation gives in to fear, because they simply can't ignore the evidence.A movie like this is deeply unsettling in its implications, but it is exhilarating in its boldness and message that lots of money and big name actors are not needed to make a scary film.  It was shot on a shoestring budget by a little-known film company and directors.  The characters are given the names of the actors.  Everything is 'real' as far as the movie is concerned, and that was real enough for me to decide I won't be camping again for awhile.",Null,1,2,21 July 1999
Se7en," A dark journey, literally
","Seven is a movie that left its imprint on my mind for days.  I remember being so shaken leaving the theater that I had trouble unlocking my car door, because my hands were shaking so bad.  It's that frightening, not in its content but its message.  It is not exaggerating to say that this film is lacking in any hope.The movie tells the story of the last seven days in the career of a veteran homicide detective, name Will Somersett, played by Morgan Freeman in a brilliant performance.  He is retiring after 30 years on the force, because he is simply tired of it.  He has seen so much evil, so much hate and death and gore and trauma, that when he learns that his replacement asked to be transferred to his precinct (in a seedy section of a city I don't recall ever being given a name), he is amazed.The cop that will replace him is David Mills (Brad Pitt), who defensively reminds Somersett of his background, that he worked in homicide for 5 years. 'Not here,' says Somersett, and treats him like a rookie, because in all the ways that count, he still is.  He still has hope, and still feels that he can make a difference, which is why he transferred here.  Boy, will he be surprised.Their first case proves Somersett's point.  A very large man is found in his home, dead.  He was forced to eat at gunpoint until he hemmoraged internally, then kicked in the stomach to finish the job.  Another man is forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh, and a woman is savagely mutilated, then offered both a phone and sleeping pills, and allowed to choose whether to call for help or commit suicide.This is not your average serial killer.  Mills and most of the other cops believe the killer is simply brutally insane, but Somersett believes he is trying to send a message.  What kind of message?  Well, at the fat man's crime scene the word 'Gluttony' is carved into a wall.  Other murder scenes leave behind the words 'Pride' and 'Greed'.  'The Seven Deadly Sins,' intones Somersett.  He knows a lot about this sort of thing because he spends his evenings at the library, reading Dante and Saint Thomas Aquinus. Mills is less educated, and has to rely on Cliff Notes to keep up.The plot grows thicker as the killer leaves more clues, and more bodies in a trail that leads through many apartment buildings that seem to be behind in their electric payments; there hardly seems to be any light anywhere.  It rains incessantly throughout most of the movie, until the climax, which I will not describe.The movie is full of little details that add depth to otherwise small scenes.  One example: a man who runs a whorehouse is brought in for questioning after another of the murders is discovered.  In a lesser film he would have just been another slimy purveyor of cheap sex and kinky thrills, just to add a little color.  Instead, he is asked if he likes his job.  He answers by saying 'No, I don't.'  He leans forward, and glares at the cop. 'But that's just life, isn't it?'  Not exactly standout dialogue but my point is the movie takes the time to flesh out even bit characters.If I have made this movie sound dreary, bloodsoaked and hopeless, then I have described it well.  It is all of these things, and intentionally so. To say that is not to criticize it; on the contrary, it is actually very well conceived and strongly acted.  The plot is brilliantly set up, and the movie is not just a sick exploitation picture.  Every murder takes place off-screen, save one.  The filmmakers understand that it is scarier to see the aftermath of a killing than to actually see it happen.  The movie has had a noticeable impact on television as well, shows such as Millennium and Profiler could be said to have been inspired by Seven.Did I enjoy it?  In a word, no.  It is simply too dark, too staggeringly hopeless in it implications in the end that I cannot walk out of such a movie feeling like I 'enjoyed' it.  That is not to say I don't think it was a good movie.  I admire its superior craftsmanship and its style.  But afterward I felt like going someplace with lots of people and plenty of light.",Null,0,0,27 February 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Fine job of depicting Shakespeare
","Shakespeare in Love is a kind of flight of fancy about the source of Shakespeare's inspiration being a woman he fell in love with but could not have.  It should hardly come as a surprise to think that Shakespeare should have been inspired by being smitten, since so much of his best poetry emanates from characters who are in love, but the film portrays him as a struggling playwright who has recently been painstakingly penning a play called 'Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter' and finding it unbearable.This is clearly before he had found his way as one of England's most prominent playwrights.  He is under pressure from the owner of The Rose, a theatre in fierce competition with The Curtain, across the river, where Richard Burbage has just stolen Will's latest play and presented it before the Queen.  The Rose itself is threatened by its moneylender, who wants to see a play on stage in two weeks that will fill the house and make him a fortune.  Meanwhile, all of the thespians auditioning have chosen to quote Marlowe as their demonstration.Obviously, history dictates that 'Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter' will undergo signifigant changes before it hits the stage.  Shakespeare finds his will and pen being moved by his love for Lady Viola, a minor noblewoman who is due to be married to the arrogant Lord Wessex.  Wessex is suspicious of Will from their first meeting, and his worst fears are confirmed by the Queen, who interrogates Viola according to custom, to approve her for marriage, and then tells him, 'Have her then, but you'd be a lordly fool.  She's been plucked, and not by you.'  However, he thinks she is in love with Marlowe, since Shakespeare identifies himself as him.Soon, as the play gradually is shaped into what would become 'Romeo and Juliet', Viola secretly auditions for the role of Romeo under the guise of a non-existent actor named Thomas Kent.  She is perfect for the role, except for the fact that she is a woman, and therefore barred from the stage. Paltrow gives a winning performance in a character that has to do a sort of Victor/Victoria switch, by playing a woman playing a male actor who plays a female part in a play.Judi Dench is one of the best things about the film, bringing her characteristic wit with her into her role of Queen Elizabeth.  She is sharp-tongued and unrelenting, but demonstrates subtle sympathy at a crucial moment.  I also enjoyed Joseph Fiennes as Will Shakespeare, who finds the right tone of the tormented artist without creeping into melodrama.  Tom Stoppard does a good job of bringing the language and readings to life.  See it even if you never read a word of Shakespeare.",Null,1,2,14 February 1999
Alien: Resurrection," No dignity left for this series
","The makers of this film should have taken a cue from the last film in which Ripley, the main character, killed herself, and just called it quits.  There are few things as irritating as a series that has long since gone bad but just won't die.  The last Alien film, Alien3, was bad, but I would have sat through it again to avoid seeing this gory, slimy mess. The plot, for lack of a better term, revives Ripley 200 years after she killed herself to end the alien terror that had chased her through three previous movies.  She is cloned by military scientists intent on harnessing the alien within her as an unstoppable weapon.  One would think that they would have learned from the past, since I can not think of one character that has survived at this point against these creatures, but never mind, soon the alien and his other cloned siblings are being closely studied in thick glass chambers.  Ripley, played again by Sigourney Weaver, is the best thing about this movie, and the only one who projects any kind of personality.  She warns them, calmly, that the alien queen they have bred will escape.  Sure enough, soon there are aliens crawling all over, and a motley crew of a freighter stranded on the station is fighting against them to survive.  One of them is Cole, played by Wynona Ryder in a performance that could have been turned in by anyone, who harbors a secret about her identity.  Who cares?  Virtually all the interesting characters are killed off in the first 10 minutes.  I found myself at least perking up when Weaver is on the screen, because I know it will at least be entertaining.  She seems to have a strange connection with the aliens, and has acid blood like they do, somehow.  Her character is an example of a direction the movie willfully ignores to follow.  I would have liked to know more about her relationship with the aliens. The sad thing is that the first movie in the series, Alien, was such a classic example of this genre done right.  One alien, with an interesting cast of characters you cared about, was far more terrifying and effective than thousands crawling around a darkened ship slaughtering dozens of characters we care nothing for.  This film is a demonstration to what happens when you take a promising idea and drag it out over two decades until it grows listless and sophomoric.",Null,0,0,25 January 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Outrageous, offensive...and funny
","I shrink from criticizing 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut'.  The movie is uncategorizable, except perhaps as comedy, I guess.  It is appalling, outrageous, incredibly offensive...and in the end, very funny.That's right, funny.  I am probably one of the last people who would expect to find myself laughing at scenes of small, badly animated children uttering unbelievably foul dialogue in rapid succession, but 'South Park' left me rolling on the floor sometimes.  I am not too proud of all I laughed at, nor am I sure it is a good thing.  It is an understatement to say that much of the humor in the movie pushes the boundaries of bad taste.  It is certainly not for young children, which is of course the point of the movie, or as close as you will get to a point.What plot there is follows the misadventures of the children of South Park, mainly Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny, in trying to get into an R-rated movie starring their heroes, off-color Canadian comedians Terrance and Philip, whose comedy centers mainly on shouting curses at each other and making bodily noises you would not likely hear at dinner parties.  One thing leads to another, and soon President Clinton is issuing war against Canada, while Satan and recently departed Saddam Hussein carry on a affair fraught with communication issues.  It doesn't matter how the movies gets there. In the meantime there are jabs, or better put, groin-kicks, against countless celebrities.  I think I can recall Brian Dennehy, Brian Boitano, Wynona Ryder, the Baldwin brothers, and Bill Gates, just to name a few.What is there to say about this movie, but that I laughed?  I am familiar with its characters from the series, which I have watched only on occasion. Most of the laughs on the series were genuinely drawn, but the movie forced laughs out of me, partly from shock; I simply could not believe what I was seeing.  The movie goes way, way over the top the way it pulls its punches, but it is certainly ambitious in its undertaking.Expect to be offended.  Many of the jokes are flat-out gross.  These are the ones I laughed at.  I also laughed at the ones that made fun of popular culture.  This is fair game, in my opinion.  I did not laugh at several jokes that were simply racially insensitive, to say the least.  Those left me feeling unclean, and could have been left out without taking anything away from the movie.I am told that the creators of South Park, who made this movie, did so largely to send a message to the Motion Picture Association of America, who is notorious for giving tougher ratings to movies with strong language than those that are blood-soaked.  They have responded by creating a movie that contains heavy doses of both, with a smattering of gross-out humor.  The result?  A movie that Cartman would say 'warped my fragile little mind!'",Null,0,0,1 July 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A treat for Tolkien fans
","As a long-time Tolkien fan, I had great reservations about the live-action production of his now legendary trilogy, 'The Lord of the Rings'.  I wondered how good it could really be; it seemed unlikely anyone could truly capture the breadth and scope of Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth and its inhabitants.  Peter Jackson, the director, has taken upon himself a massive undertaking made nonetheless risky because of the demanding audience of 'Rings' fans.The film is actually a wonderful surprise.  The filmmakers have wisely chosen not to merely migrate the book to the big screen, but transform it. The books are mostly about the journey; going from place to place with adventures and battles along the way but staying rooted in the travels of its characters.  Jackson has created an overarching epic here that doesn't lose this quality but delves more deeply into the action.  It is telling that the movie stretches scenes such as the flight from the Black Riders or the battle with the Orcs at Khazad-Dum into substantial set pieces, while in the novel these are relegated to a paragraph or two.  I especially enjoyed a scene that conveys the traditional 'crossing of the threshold': Samwise, Frodo's traveling companion, stops as they move through a field and says apprehensively, 'If I take one step more I will be farther from home than I ever have been.'One problem any version of the Lord of the Rings must endure is the way its audience has already formed its own individual ideas of how things look. When I read the books, I pictured Hobbits in my mind as small, furry folk who loved to smoke and eat numerous times a day, living underground in their hobbit-holes.  In the movie they look much as I pictured them.  Then the orcs appeared, and I can't say they looked as I imagined (they seemed a bit too small and agile).  Yet this didn't bother me because this is the filmmakers' vision and not my own.  This is imagination brought to life from the minds of others who have read and loved the same stories and see it a bit differently.It would be pointless to describe the plot of the film since it's target audience is intimately familiar with the books.  I will say it is surprisingly faithful to the story (with some notable exceptions).  One brief love scene seemed inserted to appeal to a broader audience but does nothing to detract from the story as a whole.One truly astonishing aspect is the film's scenery, which is stunning.  It was shot in New Zealand (along with the other two which were filmed simultaneously).  Many sword and sorcery epics seem to take place in the woods on the fringes of suburbia, but here we see expansive mountainous regions and vast forests that seem to stretch for miles.  One scene has the heroes floating down a river between two gigantic statues of kings with their hands outstretched as if in warning, and it brings home the dedication to detail and realism used even in this mythic setting.The casting is largely on target.  Elijah Wood hits just the right notes as Frodo by conveying an age beyond his tender years (and size).  Viggo Mortensen is convincing as Aragorn, a secretive and tormented ranger.  Ian Holm, practically a Hobbit himself, is perfect as the aging Bilbo, and Liv Tyler uses her already elfin appearance to the hilt as Arwen.  The only odd casting choice to me was Sean Astin as Samwise, whom I last saw in 'Rudy' where he played an undersize football player.  He's now grown rather husky, but he uses this to his advantage in a largely thankless role (although he becomes more important in the later books).'Fellowship of the Rings' could have been what I feared it would be: a silly sword-and-sorcery flick that gets mired in special effects while substituting action for depth.  Take the summer film 'Dungeons and Dragons' for example.  Instead, it takes the time to develop its characters, and places them in a setting that is both epic on scope and mythic in dimension. The film is a bit long at three hours, and it ends abruptly; but it is based on a long book with a lot of ground to cover, and it is the first in a trilogy after all.  I hope the remaining films live up to it's grand vision and ambitiousness, and I think that based on what I've seen here, I can be optimistic.  This is a wonderful entry into a great epic.",Null,0,0,27 December 2001
The Patriot," Revised American history doesn't quite sink movie
","Here is the ultra-simplified American history for the MTV generation. 'The Patriot' is a movie that essentially takes the entire American Revolution with all its complex motivations and political nuances, and boils it all down into a revenge plot.  It's almost amusing to see how the movie tries to struggle free of this notion, as it offers up some simplified images of glory and honor, while all the while the lead character's motivation is essentially the same: to kill his nemesis.   That's not to say 'The Patriot' is all bad.  Once you get past all the (literal) flag-waving and glorified American perspectives on the Revolutionary War, its actually pretty involving.  I found myself drawn into its story almost against my will.  It's a credit to Roland Emmerich, the director, and the screenplay, that the movie succeeded at making me care about Gibson's quest for justice even as I couldn't help rolling my eyes as he grabs an American flag and charges up a hillside to rout the fleeing rebel troops to turn around and press forward.   The process by which Gibson gets there is a long and dark journey.  His character, Benjamin Martin, is a farmer and dedicated family man with a South Carolina plantation where he simply wants to harvest his crops and live in peace.  He is a highly respected hero of the French-English War years ago but has decided that war should never be used, even as a last resort, and is willing to sacrifice principle to this cause, as he lectures on in a speech he makes before a voting council that must decide on whether or not to join the revolution.  The movie opens in 1776 as the Declaration of Independence is about to be announced.  Martin's oldest son, Gabriel, signs on with the Continental army against his father's wishes, and goes off to war, where he fights for two years and becomes battle-hardened but loses none of his idealism.   The same cannot be said of the rebels themselves, whose morale begins to falter as they suffer one defeat after another.  The decisive battles in the war were not won on the traditional battlefield, and the untrained and ill-equipped militia forces are cannon-fodder for the stalwart British. Eventually, Martin is compelled to join the fight when one of his young sons is killed by a vicious British officer named Tavington, who chooses to use fear and repression to crush the revolt, and employs brutal tactics to accomplish this goal.  Martin gathers a ragtag bunch from the surrounding towns and forms a militia of his own, that hides out in the swamp and uses hit-and-run tactics to catch the British off-guard.  Ultimately his goal is to search and destroy Tavington.   The British are portrayed as either weak-minded or cruel, with the intent of making us feel a certain satisfaction when we see them being killed by muskets and hacked by tomohawks.  The guerilla tactics used by Martin to halt the flow of supplies are far more effective than the marching of the Continental troops into overwhelming fire from the enemy.  What's odd is the way the movie seems to be suggesting that Martin was the first one to come up with the idea, when by 1778 I imagine this idea had occurred to and even been used by George Washinton.  But the famous figures of the Revolution, including Washington, are never seen, and indeed are but shadowy figures in the movie while Martin leads his men into battle and more or less wins the war singlehandedly.  I admit I found it hard to believe at the film's climax when the battle slows to a crawl to allow Martin and Tavington to go at it, mano-e-mano.  This is all a sort of laughable revisionist history to embrace, but I was able to overlook it and just enjoy watching Gibson at work.  He has a way of seeming plausible in the face of such silliness, and even though his character exhibits similar traits to that of his portrayal of William Wallace from 'Braveheart' (to which this movie will inevitably be compared) I still identified with his losses and his principles.  He brings a certain dignity to the role.  I also enjoyed seeing Chris Cooper as the weary commander of the Continental regiment he is aiding, and Heath Ledger as his impulsive son who joins them.     One complaint I would register is the way that the African-Americans in this movie are relegated to the position of mute observers.  If the movie had not shown blacks at all I might have preferred that to watching them be dismissed out of hand, but due to the prevalence of slavery in the Carolinas in that day that would hardly have been realistic.  There is one slave who joins Martin's band but his thoughts and motives aren't really explored. While it is true that slaves who joined up were generally given their freedom at the end of the war, I felt as if this character was being used as a token, and it made me somewhat uncomfortable to watch as the movie tipped the race card.  Having watched 'Glory' which revealed how black soldiers helped turn the tide of victory to the Union and treated its black characters with more dignity, this sort of pandering seemed superficial.  All this aside, 'The Patriot' works on the level of pure entertainment, and I enjoyed it as such.  I also would not recommend it be shown in history class.",Null,1,1,3 July 2000
Dark City," Visually intensive
","Dark City is the kind of movie you either love or hate.  I have spoken both to people and read reviews that tore it down for being 'soulless' and 'boring' and others who felt it was the best film of the year.  Like it or not, it is hard to be indifferent to it.The movie takes place in a nameless city that appears always to be enshrouded in darkness.  It is never daytime in this place.  Every day, at midnight, the entire city crawls to a halt, and its residents awaken to new identities and lives, without knowing they were ever anyone else.  One of these citizens is played by Rufus Sewell, who awakens in a bathtub in a strange apartment, without any knowledge of who he is or how he got there. His confusion and fear are heightened by the presence of a dead body in the bedroom.  A stranger calls him, warning him to leave at once.  Strange, deathly pale men wearing black are coming up the elevator to get him.He stumbles across his wallet, and learns his name is John Murdoch, although names in this reality mean little; they are as transitory as the identities that the people have from day to day (or night to night, as the case may be).  He has a wife, or so it seems, played by Jennifer Connelly in a luminous performance.  She is distressed over his apparent lunacy and the possibility that he may be a murderer.  Is he?  Murdoch himself cannot be sure, but the detective assigned to the case is suspicious, not of Murdoch, because he senses he is not a killer, but of the circumstances.  What is he supposed to think about the case when his predecessor went mad, drawing bizarre spirals all over his room?John witnesses what others do not, the midnight transference of memories from one person to the next, and the frightening warping of the city in twisting, wrenching gasps emanating from below the ground.  Deep in the bowels of the city, the Strangers, the pale men in black, think these changes into shape using the power of the mind, which they call 'chooning'.It soon becomes apparent that John Murdoch can choon as well.  How did he get this ability?  What is the purpose of the Strangers and their twisted experiments?  The movie answers these questions, but the heart of the movie is in the visuals, which are as intensive and refreshing as anything I have seen.  Special effects in movies have become threadbare exercises in what we have seen many times before, but this movie displays vast and sweeping visuals that are a feast for the eyes.  The Strangers are terrifying in their conformity and lack of emotion, and the scariest is a child with homicidal tendencies.  The human players are well-drawn, and the city is a dark nightmare of wet streets and flickering lights and grungy alleys.  Dark City is a demonstration of what happens when filmmaker's imaginations are allowed to run wild.",Null,0,1,2 February 1999
Pearl Harbor," Depressingly popcorn
","I was born quite a few years after December 7th, 1941, but had I survived the attack on Pearl Harbor and then watched this movie today, I would probably react with a mixture of disgust and despair.  Then again, maybe I would have only been as bored as I was without the benefit of experience. 'Pearl Harbor' is a movie that uses World War II as a backdrop for a love story of astonishing banality that contributes to one of the most witless experiences I've had.The movie is three hours long, but it would have seemed long at two.  Hell, it would have seemed long at 45 minutes, which is the length of time at the center of the movie that is focused on the attack itself.  'The day that will live in infamy' still evokes strong emotions from those who lived through it, but from the movie's perspective it did little but provide a set piece for an action movie.  The special effects by Michael Bay are impressive, indeed; we see Japanese fighter planes divebombing the ships in harbor, flying between them at high speed, while those on the ground flee in fear or shoot from the decks.  Most of this is pitched at the level of a video game, especially when the two heroes, Danny and Rafe, climb into their own planes and proceed to start shooting down every enemy plane they can. Unlike Spielberg's earlier 'Saving Private Ryan' which had convincing footage of the landing at Normandy but also a moral context, 'Pearl Harbor' is completely lacking in insight.  Instead, the attack becomes nothing but appalling visions of slaughter for benefit of entertainment.The dialog in the movie is truly amazing, but not for it's good qualities. Take Evelyn's consolation to Rafe, whom she loves, as she explains her motives: 'My heart belongs to Danny, but I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you.'  Thanks a whole lot.  Of course, that's after Jon Voight has woodenly tried to portray President Roosevelt standing up defiantly from his wheelchair after being told by his cabinet that a military assault on Japan is impractical, and stating, 'Gentlemen, do not tell me what cannot be done!'  As I understand it, history does record him saying something to this effect, but I doubt it came across as lamely as it does in this movie.The Japanese are given the 'hindsight is 20-20' treatment:  Admiral Yamamoto, who orchestrated the attack, muses anxiously that 'I fear that all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant.'  They act as if seeming unlikely to have attacked, had they not been called upon to do so in service of the plot.  It's as if the filmmakers were afraid of seeming callous if they depicted the Japanese as actually having Imperialism as a motive.  The Japanese continue to make movies about Hiroshima and Nagasaki without sympathy for the American perspective and justifiably so: it was a defining moment for them, just as Pearl Harbor was a defining moment for Americans. I cannot recall a film about the Enola Gay in which Truman is heard to say 'I fear all we have done is unleashed an apocalypse on an unsuspecting city.'The movie pays token respect to African-Americans with its depiction of Dorie Miller, the black cook aboard one of the carriers who grabs the controls of an anti-aircraft gun during the attack and shoots down several enemy planes.  Curiously, despite the location being Hawaii, I did not notice a single person of Polynesian descent during the entire movie.Nothing about the movie offers up any historical perspective on the events that take place.  I attended the film with a friend who afterward defended it as a 'popcorn movie'.  To describe this movie about the tragic loss of three thousand lives in the same terms as those used by critics in referring to 'The Mummy Returns' is no less depressing for its accuracy.",Null,0,1,12 January 2002
The Usual Suspects," Less than meets the eye
","Watching The Usual Suspects gave me a feeling of emptiness.  There was so much happening on the screen, such good acting, so many plot twists.  Yet it all adds up to much less than it appears, largely because everything about the plot, the characters, and the dialogue turns out to be completely arbitrary.  What is it about, really? I can try to describe what it seems to be about.  I am afraid I will fail to cover all the bases, because this is the kind of movie that requires much notetaking, index cards, organization charts and detailed presentations to keep track of the plot.  5 men meet when they find themselves in the same holding cell after being arrested for various petty offenses.  They swap war stories about their various lines of work, and one of them brings up the fact that he stumbled across a startling piece of information: plainclothes detectives are using unmarked cars to provide armed transport for mafia bosses willing to shell out good money for this service.  After being let out they set one of these cars on fire, to draw media attention to this fact.  This sort of thing is the stuff of male bonding, I guess, because they decide they like working together. A mysterious man shows up (Pete Postlethwaite, in a nice performance). He offers them a lot of money to do a job for his 'client'.  The job involves stealing cargo from a European freighter docked in the city harbor. It comes out that it is really an excuse to get the men aboard to eliminate a witness who could put his 'client' at risk.  Eventually, the client, they are told, is Kayser Sozay, a notorious Hungarian crime lord whose very name causes stark fear in those who speak it.  Legend has it that he killed his own wife and children when rival drug lords attempted to drive him out of town. If I have missed anything, please excuse me, but I believe in doing so I have made my point.  The Usual Suspects is the kind of movie that demonstrates what it means when critics say a film has too much plot for its own good.  There are many twists and turns, and surprises.  I am not averse to surprises but in the end I felt manipulated, as though there was no way to sort out all the details to make sense of what had transpired.  The ending suggests that everything we have seen may never have happened.  Did it?  I felt as if I didn't care.  If the filmmakers don't care enough about their own plot I can hardly be expected to. It's too bad, because the movie wastes a good cast.  Kevin Spacey is fascinating, Gabriel Byrne does a good job with his role, as do Pollack and Postlethwaite.  I enjoyed Chaz Palminteri as the detective assigned the joyless task of discovering who Sozay is.  But it takes too much energy to follow this, and the performances are lost in a maze of plot devices.  Enjoy it for the acting, but take along a notebook if you plan to piece together the story afterward.",Null,2,4,5 February 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Uplifting and sincere
","The key scene in The Shawshank Redemption comes when Red is confronted by Andy Dufresne with the fact that he has given up hope.  'Hope is a dangerous thing,' says Red, and we understand, after the trials he has been through, why he can say this and believe it.  And because this is such a well-crafted film, we can also see why Andy refuses to accept this philosophy, because by this time we have come to know them both so well. The movie follows the lives of these two men, who have come to Shawshank Prison at different times in their lives, as very different people. Red has been there long enough, denied parole enough times that he no longer waits for the day he will be released, but for the days he makes his pickup at the laundromat for the goods he sells to the inmates.  Andy was a wealthy banker on the outside, who is sentenced to prison for killing his wife and lover in a nightmarish trial, the kind where every shred of evidence points to culpability.  The movie casts doubt on his guilt long before it reveals what actually happened.  In prison he faces beatings, rape and oppression, but there is some kind of redemption here, too; as the film's title suggests, this is not a joyless foray into prison life but a story about the way two different men cope with the day to day routine of incarceration, and what follows beyond it. What amazed me, watching the movie, is the the filmmakers have pulled of the tricky job of taking this material that could have been cloying and made it plausible, even meaningful.  It is worth seeing just as a statement about how the choices we make in life are more important than what happens to us.",Null,1,1,25 January 1999
The Truman Show," Though-provoking and a little scary
","The Truman Show is entertaining at the same time that it is frightening. The frightening insight into the Truman Show is that the main character's very life is television.  The kicker is that he does not realize it.  Every part of his life, his daily routine, from when he gets up to when he goes to bed and even while he sleeps, is broadcast to the world.  He exists in kind of the ultimate fishbowl: a gargantuan artificial terrarium ('one of only two structures in the world that are visible from space!') that contains within it the village of Seahaven, a coastal town where Truman Burbank, the unwitting star, lives and works as an insurance agent.The film provides a semi-serious role for Jim Carrey, an actor who I at first found tasteless but have recently grown to respect, not the least because of his performance in this movie.  He is required to walk a fine line between comedy and wistfullness.   It is a tricky job but he pulls it off, creating a believable performance as a man who is just beginning to suspect that there is something off in his universe.More than anything else, the movie gives the audience a lot to think and talk about.  The modern media has entered into our private lives to a unprecedented degree over the last two decades.  Although I doubt such an undertaking could ever be seriously contemplated, just how far are we from the Truman Show?  How far are we willing to go?  The film also raises serious questions about the quality of life.  Is is better to live a life in paradise and never know it is fake and that everyone is watching, or to live in 'our' reality?  It may seem like a simple question, but just think about it, and it won't seem so simple, and then watch this movie.",Null,0,0,28 February 1999
The Thin Red Line," Dreamy but confusing
","I liked 'The Thin Red Line' without really being drawn into it.  It contains imagery that will stay with me for a long time, and it is a compelling depiction of the grinding journey of numerous characters through the invasion of Guadacanal.  It is clearly a labor of love, and the effort shows.  It contains a stellar cast that includes Sean Penn, Stanley Tucci, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, with a walk-on role by George Clooney.  These are the strong points.The movie opens with two soldiers that have found an island paradise and are living amongst its peaceful inhabitants when they are picked up by a passing battleship and arrested for going AWOL.  They are dropped into a battalion that is storming Guadacanal in a crucial battle for territory.  Leading the troops is a zealous commander played by Nolte as a man driven by what he perceives as fate and leadership, but is hiding deep-seated insecurities beneath the surface.  The movie basically follows this invasion from beginning to end, and depicts the randomness in which the characters live or die during it.I mentioned before that there were numerous characters.  I should say that there seem at times to be dozens that the film follows from beginning to end, and I frequently had trouble telling them apart.  Although I have little doubt the novel the movie is based on follows the same structure, I think the film could have benefited from some strategic trimming to focus on a smaller group.  I could not really identify with the characters since there were so many the movie is forced to jump from one to the next so rapidly I often didn't realize it had changed scenes.  We see one guy crawling through the grass and then later another guy, cut to so quickly it seems like the same guy.The movie will undoubtedly suffer comparison to 'Saving Private Ryan', the other WWII movie released that year that won acolades for Steven Spielberg. That movie had a clear direction and a definite message, and it focused on a group of characters you could really identify with.  Of the two, I prefer 'Ryan' for the reasons I stated above.But 'Thin Red Line' is worth seeing for its quiet moments of truth, and the way it convincingly displays the complete futility of war.  As we watch men forced to climb through the tall grass up a long hill and get cut down by hidden enemy soldiers, we can see the senselessness of it all, the waste of life.  It must be unimaginably frustrating to be ordered to take an action that you know will end your life and accomplish nothing, and be unable to protest.The movie, as I said, contains visuals that are striking.  We see things from the soldiers perspective as they creep up the hills of Guadacanal to the enemy guns at the top.  There are sunsets, and native children swimming in the crystal tides.  There are closeups of captured enemy soldiers that express their fear and humiliation through their eyes.Perhaps the thing that will stay with me most is the music.  Parts of it contain the clear voices of a Melanesian choir, and is as haunting and beautiful as any music I have heard in the movies.  The film has a standard soundtrack that is worth its salt but you may consider springing for 'Chants of the Thin Red Line', which contains exclusively Melanesian chants used in the film, sung by various choirs of the Blessed Islands.'The Thin Red Line' deserves to be admired for its boldness in not attempting to be a carbon copy of so many other war movies, or a pale imitation of 'Saving Private Ryan'.  It wants to be a dreamy overview of war in its own right, and it accomplishes that goal.  Perhaps it is best to view it in the right mood and simply allow it to wash over your mind, and then remember the parts that struck you.",Null,0,0,1 November 1999
