The Mask," Truly Jim Carrey's Finest Work
","First off, let me say that Jim Carrey is probably my favorite actor of all-time. I've enjoyed him in a lot of his movies, like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber, and Liar Liar, but none of them are quite like The Mask. This brilliant script has everything, 1940's gangster movie suspense, silent film slapstick, and classic Looney Tunes inspired antics all thrown into a blender. The CGI effects, make-up, and costumes are all fantastic, but what is also amazing is that Jim Carrey is pretty much playing two separate characters in the same movie. He does his usual wacky shtick as The Mask but he also plays a sympathetic hero as Stanley Ipkiss. The beautiful music is just icing on the cake. Without a doubt, The Mask is a comedic masterpiece. This will always be my favorite Jim Carrey movie.",10,1,2,6 October 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Simply A Masterpiece
","The greatest TV cartoon ever made has finally been made into a movie. The Simpsons Movie is just as funny and clever as the TV series, if not more-so. While the plot may not be as well developed, it's a more than attractive story to me. This is quite easily the funniest movie of 2007. It's quite possible you'll die of oxygen deficiency, you'll be laughing so hard. There are so many funny things in this movie, I couldn't possibly list them all here, but I will list the ones I can remember. The opening Green Day scene, the church scene, Homer & Bart on the roof, Russ Cargill, President Schwarzenegger, Homer whipping the sled dogs, and that random pig. There are also a few emotional scenes here and there, and that's one of the things that made the TV show great. The animation and the music are even better than in the TV series, of course. This movie is just amazing. Right after Ratatouille and Surf's Up, The Simpsons Movie is my third favorite movie of summer 2007. My sincerest thanks to Matt Groening and company.",10,4,7,4 August 2008
