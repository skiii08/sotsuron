Howl's Moving Castle," Incredibly beautiful , terribly boring
","I'm a great fan of Miyazaki's movies. I really wanted to have loved this, I really wanted to. But I couldn't. The animation it´s high quality, as you would expect from Miyazaki movie: It's beautiful, criative, rich in detail and very well built. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same of the characters, which are not so memorable and fun. Here we don't have anthological creatures like Totoro or No-Face, nor do we have such charismatic characters like Mononoke, Chihiro, Haku, Lupin III, Nausicaa, Porco Rosso. The plot is confusing, tiring and boring. Miyazaki movies usually have crazy twists and crazy situations, but the Howl's Moving Castle is just too confusing in excess. The beginning, when Sophie is a young woman, is spectacular, but then the story becomes a mess as it moves on - the idea was good, but it was not well executed. THMC has probably the most beautiful sceneries I've ever seen in a Miyazaki movie, but in term of character, soul, life, story, plot, it falls far short of such classics as Spirited Away, The Castle of Cagliostro and Princess Mononoke.",5,1,2,5 January 2019
Armageddon," The most underrated movie of all time
","This glorious movie has everything you can expect to enjoy: action, drama, comedy, romance, epic outbursts, emotional moments, great special effects that have aged almost nothing and a good soundtrack. I like movies that even with a serious premisse, don't take itselves too seriously, having scenes that allow us to smile and laugh a little. This is Armageddon. No, this isn't philosophical or the most deeper and realist plot, cause this is not the prupose.Bruce Willis is Harry Stamper, the father that every daughter in the earth wants and would be proud to have: a flawed but deeply heroic guy, tough on the outside with a soft heart on the inside, willing to die to save not only his daughter but all humanity. Liv Tyler lives Grace, at the height of her beauty, that even not participating in the action still brings us emotional moments with the interaction between her dad and her boyfriend. Ben Affleck is decent in the role of A.J., incarnating the typical reckless hero guy who is in love with the beautiful girl and that ries to win the trust of his jealous father-in-law, who at heart loves him and is like a father to him too.Is it cliché? Yeah. But it's a cliché that manages to entertain me for almost 3 hours and still manages to pull tears at the end. The scene of Harry switching places with AJ and giving his final speech to Grace always makes me cry and if that part doesn't bring you any emotional reaction, you not have a soul or a heart... And I can't finish without to say the supporting cast is great too, especially Steve Buscemi, who is perfect on paper comic relief role.",10,0,1,29 April 2020
The Dark Knight," Boring, pretentious and far from the Batman comic book
","As a fan of Batman, this is undoubtedly the most unpopular opinion of my entire life. But I cannot stand this movie. For me this is the most pretentious and overrated movie in the history of cinema. Heath Ledger's Joker was charismatic, but taking it away ... What do we have? We have a movie that makes Batman a mere supporting character in his own film. A Batman with no balls and no detective soul. Confused, messy, uninspired fights. Boring, lifeless, uninspired scenarios. A Gotham turned into some another generic and commom American city. An overly dramatic, heavy, humorless and violent tone. Batman is usually dark, yes, but one thing is to be dark, another is to want to sound like a play by Shakespeare. TDK takes itself very seriously and this sucks. Oh for God's sake, at the end we are talking just about a guy who dresses in bat and walks around town for fighting crime. It doesn't have to be complicated, it doesn't have to be too complex, it doesn't have to be very philosophical. I just want to look at the movie and think, 'This is a Super-Hero movie!' Exactly the same feeling that Spiderman 1, 2 and Burton movies always makes me feel every time I watch. The Dark Knight is not a genuine Super-Hero movie. It's simply a police story that happens in a generic city by chance called Gotham where by chance Batman and the Joker are inserted, with Batman being only a supporting character.",2,5,8,8 July 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," It's not an easy movie to watch. There are things I hate, others I love.
","Yes, there may be many meanings behind the Monolith and that bizarre ending. Yes, the visual and special effects is unquestionably dazzling and aged like wine. Yes, it's one of the most unique movies in the cinema. But let's talk frankly, the movie isn't fun to watch. The pace is painfully slow. Before even the 'A Space Odyssey' title appears, we have to stand a nasty soundtrack playing for three minutes in the black screen. This is a warning to all the boredom that awaits us. Starting with a bunch of monkeys screaming and jumping, which is very annoying , or a bunch of generic, uninteresting people talking and eating while spacecrafts move like turtles in space. While the spacecraft descends on the moon, or when Dave is trying to rescue his mate, you could go to the kitchen to make a cup noodles, return to the screen and find that the spacecraft has not yet touched the lunar soil and Dave has not rescued Frank yet. But the third part is what saves this movie, because HAL 9000 is in it. HAL is the thing I love in this movie and I think that's what saved the movie, because all the moments that HAL is acting are fun, and all the times HAL isn't in scene are boring or bizarre like hell. The last part is the most WTF thing that I've ever seen. And is basically it.",5,0,3,26 November 2017
