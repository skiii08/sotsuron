Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Lowbrow humor: not that funny of watching being worth
","I went in to see Borat completely oblivious of any reading on what the movie was supposed to be about. My brief glance of a few review excerpts led me to believe it was going to be a political satire, but in the end, it was a very tired and unimaginative brand of lowbrow humor.The trouble is that Borat really never does anything outrageous. I guess this is because it's supposed to be documentary, but other 'real' movies, like South Park (and of course, the series) and Austin Powers: Goldmember have done it so much better and gone so much farther.Borat is mostly just a string of boring scenes, and Borat himself isn't very funny. Most of the best humor has to do with Ken Davitian's Azamat Bagatov, especially one infamous scene that truly pushes the boundary of comedy. Unfortunately, it is one of the few scenes in the movie to be outrageous enough to be funny. Most of it is just blah, amusing at best. To Borat: Try harder.",4,1,8,6 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Save your money
","For me, M:i:III was an impulse watch, something I went to see and paid the hefty admission for because it was there. Unfortunately, unlike some impulse discoveries, MI3 wasn't a positive surprise. Actually, it wasn't pretty much anything. It was just there.Well, maybe there was one surprise in the movie. I took the risk that it would be another Mission: Impossible 2, even without director John Woo. This time, instead, J.J. Abrams, the director from the TV series Lost, took the helm. Perhaps it's no surprise then that M:i:3 is as exciting as a standard TV movie. Not to say that this isn't a big-budget film, absolutely not: the stars are well paid and the sets and locales are gorgeous. But even with high production values, the movie is bland and unimaginative, mostly due to directing and script.MI3 really tries to be an exciting action movie. There are explosions, lots of hanging-by-the-thread situations, car chases, hand-to-hand combat and whatnot, a little of everything, except imagination and soul. For example, there's a scene where Ethan Hunt leaps off the roof of a building. That was a great opportunity for a massive camera dive that would have really captivated the audience, but no. Instead we get a boring stunt side shot, the like which we have seen countless times before. And that's just the problem with M:i:3: it has nothing new. From the plot to the action scenes, everything in this movie lacks the excitement and suspense of an action movie, because it has all been seen countless times over the past 20 years.M:i:3 is not a movie that pushes action movies forward, and that is why even the high production values end up in mediocrity. It's not a bad movie, but it's not a good one either, just hopelessly bland and unimaginative. In some ways, it even compares unfavorably to last summer's Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which was another dull dozer. You would do better to invest the ticket fare in a DVD of Kung Fu Hustle, for example, or just about anything else that you know you'll like.",4,0,1,17 May 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Empty tale of visual bravado
","Narnia isn't the next Lord of the Rings, nor the next Harry Potter, at least on the cinema screen. Even what spirit those fantasy spectacles had, Narnia lacks. And it seems the whole hundreds-plus audience, many of whom were children, agreed with me in their numb, passive state. No yelps of joy, excitement nor even the slightest scare. After the movie ended, both kids and adults were in such a rush to leave, silent and obviously underwhelmed, that some of them missed the tacked-in ending during the credits.Visually, the movie is a quality work, displaying technical prowess and craftsmanship. You will wonder how they managed to create all beasts from the real world to the mythology, from beavers, panthers and lions to fauns, centaurs and gryphons. There are also some large, captivating sights such as the view of the ice castle and the scene of the final battle. The snow is dubious though, but I guess that is acceptable.What is not acceptable is the soullessness and joylessness of the rest of actual content of the film. Much of it weighs down upon the main roles the main roles. Georgie Henley's Lucy Pevensie gets a lot of screen time compared to her siblings, which is for the better thanks to her charisma. The rest of three, however, come off as stiff and unnatural, with perhaps more fault to the script and directing than the actors themselves. The children are portrayed as precocious on some occasions, yet unbelievably daft on others. Due to this, the three eldest siblings are thrown quite off balance during the film, and not in the credible way of children, but rather for the goal-oriented purposes of trying to build up suspense and plot where there is none.Maybe the producers have tried to make a child-centered movie by explaining the obvious, but it feels more like underestimating its young viewers. On the other hand, the deeper questions are left completely unattended, such as the nature of the Great Magic, and the importance of Humans. This leaves the story empty, and creates a soft of befuddlement over the whole movie: what was all the fighting about? Why were the good creatures good and the bad creatures not? Underneath its eye candy, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is hollow, and without a soul, the exterior fails to impress alone.",4,41,76,4 January 2006
Lost in Translation," Solid, but trivial
","It is curious how some reviewers here deride those who did not like Lost in Translation, practically insulting them. Lost In Translation is not a movie for everyone, especially those with a decent knowledge of modern Japan. Nor is it a subtle masterpiece that only emotionless brutes are unable to enjoy. Western cinema must be in a sorry state indeed if an average film like LiT is lit up as the movie of a year because it dares take two steps away from standard formulas like the age-old love story or a clearly defined main character. Those two steps are not enough, they won't take a movie anywhere.Coppola should be given some credit on creating a solid movie and directing an actor like Murray, but the film itself is too void of meaning and message to leave an impression. The main characters are not probed more than shallowly, which is a lost opportunity with an actor such as Bill Murray, and expected with a choice such as Scarlett Johansson, whose young age is so obvious as to harm the credibility of the film. Even with a setting like the futuristic Japan, the movie is not able portray anything which is not already old and rugged from repetition. All in all, if you are expecting an insightful or a masterly directed film, you could very well end up disappointed.",6,1,4,21 July 2005
City of God," If it's not from Hollywood, it must be good
","There are certain people who have developed a very negative view towards Hollywood movies and U.S. cinema. In this mindset, any movie coming from the US is automatically lambasted, while non-US cinema is praised without merit. City of God, or Cidade de Deus, is one such case. Its serious overvaluing can only be attributed to a cloudy-eyed sentimentalism for the real situation behind the movie without even considering whether the movie itself has value in portraying that situation. And the unfortunate case is, no. Meirelles and Luns' generic directing is completely devoid of feeling and insight, and the actors are merely going through the motions, lacking any emotional impact in the actual proceeding of the screenplay. For these failings, the film collapses into a jiltingly generic mashup of violence and crime, with nothing to tell. There is no shock value, there is no empathy, there are no thoughts evoked. Perhaps this movie has some appeal and bearing to people who are more closely connected to Brazil and the kind of events portrayed, seeing as they can draw from another experience to put some weight into the matter, for this film by itself has none. It takes a special kind of pretentiousness and self-delusion to rate this film highly on its own merits, and the kind of a critic that dares not criticize a film with a sensitive subject. Yet this film desperately needs more of a voice of reason to call it for the empty shell it is.",3,39,91,29 September 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," An action movie without the action
","Mr & Mrs Smith is one those tricks Hollywood plays up on you - giving you commercials of an action-packed movie, setting up a delicious scene in the first minutes of the movie - and then delivering almost none of it. Mr & Mrs Smith tries to be a different action movie by completely doing away with genre norms and taking heavy dives into drama. Unfortunately, with the actors chosen, the effect is completely lost. Brad Pitt is bearable, but Angelina Jolie simply screams 'Tomb Raider' throughout the movie. Perhaps it is a sign of the weak market of female action stars, with Jolie being the best of the poor, but the movie falls as much on her account as it does on the script. Do you really want to be using your entertainment minutes on watching everyday trudgery, albeit with an unusual hook? It's like The Incredibles with real actors - super-people having to do with everyday life. Unlike The Incredibles, though, the movie has no red line to carry it through, and drags on all over the big screen. There's likely a sequel coming - there better be, with all the setup this movie squanders its screen time on.",4,1,2,2 July 2005
Iron Man," Iron Man gears up for a sequel
","It was a good film and certainly worth the admission, but not awe-inspiring like Spiderman 1 & 2. There were definitely some very cool scenes, like the fighter flight, design and building of the v.2 armor and everything having to do with Stark's fancy computer interfaces, and in the end, the scene building up to 'I am Iron Man.' Iron Man seems to be made to reach its eventual payoff not before a sequel or possibly several. It's very much an introductory movie where they're holding out on the Iron Man goodness to establish characters and develop them.This is not to say that the film would necessarily benefit from more action. The break from the constant fighting of superhero movies is refreshing, and the character interactions are handled really well and in an interesting way - with the exception of the baddie, who was just an excuse to kick any and all dogs available, and to provide an underwhelming 'big fight' at the end of the movie. Whatever motivations the antagonist might have had, they were completely undermined by the baffling and unfounded actions forced upon the character to bring some sense of conclusion to the movie.Iron Man is a good film, but held back by too much prepping for sequels instead of focusing on the movie at hand, and a main baddie whose development and motivations are criminally poor.",8,1,2,3 May 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Disappointing conclusion
","I was rather hyped for the third part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as I suppose everyone was. Unfortunately, I found it boring and lacklustre. The Return of the King barely exhibited the epic quantity that I awaited from the finale of the trilogy. It seems that by this time, the whole crew was tired of the project. Also, the omissions and changes to Tolkien's original are most glaring in RotK. The movie just whizzed by and I failed to be impressed. Maybe the Extended Edition would prove to be a more rousing experience. The normal edition, however, despite its efforts, remains a lacking ho-hum finale to what began as an impressive filmatization of the Lord of the Rings tale.",5,13,28,18 December 2004
