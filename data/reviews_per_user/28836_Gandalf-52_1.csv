Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Muy, muy! Mesa like the Phantoma Menace, berry much!
","I saw 'Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace' opening day with high hopes. And CONTRARY to some people's opinions of the movie, they did not come crashing down on my head, requiring hundreds of Jawas to sort through the rubble.Yes, the effects were spectacular, but effects do not a story make. But, good acting and well-paced dialogue do, which TPM had. Some may say the performances in TPM were not moving enough, that they lacked emotions to back them up. Bull!I agree that Jake Lloyd's performance lacked some depth, but he is not that old. He does not have as much experience as Portman, Neeson, or McGregor, because he has not been in enough roles that demand emotional depth. Give him a break!I would also like to say that some say it cannot match the original 'Star Wars: Episode 4 - A New Hope.' Yes it can. It cannot, however, match the best of the trilogy. . .'The Empire Strikes Back.' With all the characters established in the ANH, ESB was able to go deeper into the characters personalities. I think that that is what TPM is doing, laying the groundwork for the new trilogy.If you're a Star Wars fan, and you haven't seen it, see it. If you're a fan and have seen it, see it again. If you're not a fan. . .see it anyway. May the Force be with you!",Null,0,0,4 June 1999
