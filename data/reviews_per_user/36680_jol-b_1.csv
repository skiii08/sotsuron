Miracle," Sound of Ice
","As a pro skater, the actual sounds of the hockey player's blades on the ice were incredibly crisp in Miracle. For me, it made the games all the more real. Seems like a small factor to note but it is such a specific sound that was extremely well executed. Usually the 'crunch' of ice sounds in hockey or skating movies are contrived...takes a real skater to know these sounds and reproduce them so well. Maybe I missed it, but at any point in the film did anyone say, 'Do you believe in Miracles?'",Null,0,0,22 March 2004
