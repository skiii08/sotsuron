Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinettenot an airhead but not insightful either
","Marie Antoinette was fifteen when she married Louis Auguste, dauphin of France. At the death of Louis XV (1774) she became Queen of all France at the age of nineteen. She has generally borne a bad rep, mostly undeserved. Supposedly when told that the Paris mob demanded bread, she is said to have replied nonchalantly 'Let them eat cake.' The movie makes the point, which is assuredly accurate, that this story was a complete fabrication by one of Marie Antoinette's many enemies. As a foreigner and of Austrian birth (a traditional enemy of France), it is well known that she was often a convenient scapegoat for the discontent and restlessness of the French people, particularly as the political situation preceding the revolution deteriorated.The film accurately depicts the intricate and rigid court protocol surrounding Louis' and Marie Antoinette's daily rituals, beginning when they awoke and unceasing throughout the day until they went to bed. It also delves into the glitter and intrigues of the court of Versailles and the wasted lives of the courtiers. One inaccuracy: the film implies that Louis suffered from premature ejaculation, thus preventing him from producing a child with Marie Antoinette. It seems more likely that he suffered from phimosis, a condition that can afflict an uncircumcised male, making an erection very painful. Although not known for certain, apparently this was the case. Once an operation was performed to correct the condition, Louis performed fine. It might be pointed out that unlike his great-grandfather, Louis XIV, and his grandfather, Louis XV, Louis XVI was a loving husband and father and had no mistresses.We are often told that as humans we can create our own history. This is only partly true. Many individuals often find themselves overwhelmed by events not of their own choosing that are totally beyond their control, thus negating the idea that we create our own history. We can however choose how to behave even when events are overpowering. Both Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were loving parents who were swept up by the vagaries of history and destroyed by processes and events beyond their control. Unfortunately the film stops short of showing us Louis' and Marie Antoinette's final days and their courage in facing the Paris mob and their untimely deaths by the guillotine. All we are allowed to experience in the film is the vague premonition by Marie Antoinette that yielding to the demands of the Paris mob to leave Versailles and take up residence in the Tuileries in Paris sealed their fate.Ultimately Marie Antoinette was a victim of history. Only one of her four children (all by Louis XVI) survived into the nineteenth century. Although not an unfeeling monster as she has often been depicted, she wasn't especially prescient either regarding what was happening in France at the time. A much more interesting movie might have focused on someone more insightful of the events that were unfolding.",7,3,5,9 November 2006
Child 44," Paradise lost
","The Soviet Union (1930s to 1953)The movie opens with a starving, desperate boy escaping from a Ukrainian orphanage in the early 1930s during the great famine which ultimately killed millions in Ukraine. The killings are now known as the Holodomor and were Joseph Stalin's doing as he used draconian measures to force the Ukrainian kulaks to give up their independent farms and adopt collectivization on state-controlled collective farms. Stalin was also responsible for the systematic deportations and murders of prominent Ukrainians. Approximately ten million perished in this great purge. In the US during the Second World War people fondly referred to Stalin as Uncle Joe, but Stalin was no kindly uncle. He was directly responsible for the deaths of millions of human beings as was Adolph Hitler. Both were monsters. And although the two political systems of Nazism and Communism were at the opposite ends of the political spectrum, both used the same methods: leader adulation, brutal force, rampant devastation, and mass murder. And both totally despised each other to the last core of their being.The boy is rescued by Soviet troops and adopted by a Russian officer, who renames him Leo. He becomes Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy). And the next scene we see him and his wartime buddy, Alexei Andreyev (Fares Fares), storming the German Reichstag in Berlin and hoisting the bright red Soviet flag flapping in the wind on the roof of the Reichstag, showing to what was left of the battered German forces that the Soviets had taken their capital, Berlin.* This was on 2 May 1945 and the photo taken of this event became as symbolic in the Soviet Union as the photo of the four US Marines hoisting the flag on Iwo Jima. The war in Europe ended May 8 with the unconditional surrender of Germany to the Allied Forces of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.There are no murders in paradise. Paradise being the Soviet Union, which was considered a paradise for the workers. So, there could be no murders committed there by loyal Soviet citizens. Any murder was considered the work of capitalist spies who were out to destroy the Soviet Union. We now see Leo Demidov in 1953 where he is a high-level MGB investigator who has been smitten with Raisa (Noomi Rapace) and soon they are married, although we learn later her motive for marriage was far different from what Leo could ever have imagined.We see Leo at work tracking down people believed to be spies against the Soviet Union. We see torture and killings. We see mass arrests and harassment of ordinary Soviet citizens by MGB police. The 'spy' taken captive by Leo's staff under torture reveals names of seven others, and among them is Raisa. In the midst of all this Alexei's son is brutally murdered, but the MGB authorities label his death as an accident because officially there are no murders. Soon Leo and Raisa are transported to Volsk, Siberia as a demotion and Leo must report to the general of the militia there, General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman). Another child is murdered in Volsk, and Leo convinces General Nesterov that someone is purposefully and systematically murdering children. Eventually Leo and Raisa track down the murderer with the help of Nesterov. The murderer makes a stunning confession to Leo before being shot by Leo's adversary and Bete Noire, Vasili (Joel Kennaman). Leo triumphs over Vasili and Raisa realizes she's married a good man. The movie has many good points. The acting is very good and the scenery and costumes struck me as being very convincing in their depiction of the Soviet Union in 1953 and the kind of living that must have prevailed there in those times. The chief problem with the movie is that it tackles as many flaws of the Soviet system as it can, and the theme of the title, Child 44, seemed to get lost in the many comings and goings. Of what I've read, the book does the same thing. Since I've never read it, I can't comment on how successful, or unsuccessful, the book was following this approach. But following this approach in the movie means the movie's focus keeps shifting and the one-thing-right-after-another introduces too many subthemes for the audience to readily relate to. Too many things to chew on, so to speak. Some serious editing was required and it didn't happen.I can only give this movie a 7 out of 10. Good try though. And I'd still recommend it as a good historical drama set in one of the US's most tenacious adversaries at the height of its power and influence.* It's not exactly clear who the actual Soviet soldier was who hoisted the flag on the roof of the Reichstag. Suggesting his name was Leo Demidov is artistic license on the part of the movie.",7,7,17,11 May 2015
Fury," Fury dives straight down into the visceral savagery of war
","It's World War Two and April of 1945. While the Americans, British, and French cross the Rhine and slash their way through into the heart of Germany, the Russian Soviets have smashed through Eastern Germany and are breaching Berlin. Nazi Germany is teetering on its last legs.As the American Army advances, they encounter brutal resistance every step of the way. They have to work their way from village to village, cleaning out the tattered remnants of the Wehrmacht (the German Army) that now consists chiefly of teens and even children. Villages are left in rubble, both from the retreating Germans and the entering Allied forces. Hitler's fanatical command from the Führerbunker in Berlin is for every German to fight to the last man, woman, child. The Nazi motto emblazoned on signs and banners pushes this message home: Ein Volk Ein Reich Ein Führer. And for any German that dares show signs of weakening, the SS will torture and hang them.The movie focuses on an Army tank crew that has been together since the Allied invasion of North Africa (1942) and the crew has suffered its first casualty. Their turret gunner. The crew commander, Sergeant Don Collier (Brad Pitt), aka Wardaddy, is a man forged by three years of relentless war. He's kept his crew together and in one piece by adopting one maxim: kill or be killed. He carries it down to every enemy man, woman, and child he encounters, and to him every German is the enemy. Ironically, he speaks fluent German. And he's been killing them since his North African days.He's been assigned a new turret gunner, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), a raw young recruit trained by the Army to type. 'Sixty words a minute,' as he claims. Wardaddy knows he has to shape this kid up or things aren't going to work out and he'll be a liability for the crew. The acid test is when Wardaddy grabs a German prisoner caught wearing an American Army trench coat (presumably an infiltrator) and forces Norman to shoot him point blank in the back. Soon Norman is killing Germans and liking it.The tank squad consisting originally of five tanks with infantry is sent out on several missions, dreading they might run into a Tiger. Their tank is the American Army Sherman, a medium-sized tank but no match for the far better armored German Tiger tank. They liberate a German village and shoot the local SS officer as the one responsible for all the hanging bodies they passed.This is an outstanding war movie and I've seen quite a few. But it is intense and adrenaline-loaded from its very start to the final end. There is death and dying in almost every scene. But this is war and war is hell. Or as Wardaddy explains to Norman, 'Ideals are peaceful; history is violent.' 'The war will be over soon,' he says, 'but before it's over, more people will die.' Even the scene when Wardaddy and Norman invade the apartment of a German woman (Anamaria Marinca) and her young cousin, Emma (Alicia von Rittberg), the tension is palpable and hovers in the air like the angel of death. Norman is captivated by the young Emma and soon they're swooning over each other. They enter the bedroom together. The tension escalates when the three other crew members show up, but Wardaddy knows how to handle his crew and keeps things in line. As they've leaving the village, shells shriek down from the sky and blow the building with the German woman and Emma in it to smithereens. Norman rushes over and sees the broken dead body of Emma lying in the rubble. But this is war and war is hell, and more people will die before it's over.Eventually the tanks (reduced to three) set out to hold a crossroads open. They run into a German Tiger, and only Wardaddy's Sherman tank Fury (crudely painted on its cannon barrel) survives the ordeal, defeating the almost invincible Tiger. Reaching the crossroads, their tank hits a land mine that blows apart one of its treads and ruins a road wheel, rendering it motionless. But they've been ordered to defend the crossroads. A determined infantry battalion of about three hundred seasoned Waffen SS approach, and Wardaddy tells his crew they can leave if they want but he's staying. As he says of his tank, Fury, 'This is my home.' Out of sheer loyalty to their warchief they all stay. One crew member survives the carnage.The action is realistic to a tee. The acting is good although I found Pitt a bit wooden in a few places. I loved the music. The score was very good but enhanced the movie and did not interfere. I thought the flash photos at the very end were great. But we learn scarcely nothing about any of the crew members. It's like they had no life before the war. Except for Norman, all the men seem in their thirties, but there's no mention of wives, girl friends, children, what they did before the war. All we really know even of Wardaddy is he speaks fluent German and knows his Bible well as he recites a line from Isaiah before he dies. Their sole existence seems to be entirely consumed as crew members of a tank in wartime and their private lives are a total blank, which I found very strange. For this reason I give it only 8 out of 10.World War Two ended Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. But it did not end war. Is war endemic to the human species? After five millennia of civilization, one might hope that humans could find a more equitable and rational way to settle their differences. But as Wardaddy said, 'Ideals are peaceful; history is violent.' If violence is built into human nature, we'd better find a better way to channel it.",8,3,7,3 November 2014
Argo," Affleck soars
","Ten out of ten Ben Affleck. When I first saw Affleck in some film or other back in the '90s, I thought, ho-hum, some pretty boy who'll fade away. Then the early 2000s and Affleck's thing with JLo. Adios, amigo. Didn't see him after that until I saw The Company Men. Hmm. I liked the movie, and Affleck seemed to be improving with age. Then The Town, which he co-wrote the script for, acted in, and directed. HMM. This guy's showing some real legit talent. Need to watch him more carefully.Now Argo. If it doesn't win an Academy Award (Best Actor, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screen Writer, whatever), then the guys who vote on such things should be thrown to the crocodiles. In addition to Affleck, I thought all the actors, including the Iranian extras, were spot on. And the clever and adept blending of the Hollywood movie life (Arkin and Goodman were wonderful), the CIA versus Foggy Bottom, and Tehran in the grip of the Ayatollah Khomeini and the Revolutionary Guard was spot on too. And pay close attention to the beginning, which traces in documentary fashion events in Iran from the fall of Mossaddegh in 1953 through the machinations of the British and American intelligence agencies segueing to the depredations of the Shah (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) and his wife, who inhabited a cocoon where they and their cronies indulged themselves with luxuries and extravagances, abetted the use of torture, and allowed the shocking abrogation of the Iranian people's human rights. The Iranians were stir crazy-mad to make the Shah pay for his crimes--scenes well depicted in Argo--and wanted the US to return him to Iran to stand trial. This forms the crucial political background to the siege and storming of the US Embassy in Iran on 4 November 1979. I was really surprised to learn the Tehran scenes were all shot in LA and environs (hey, not that I expected the film crew to have gone to Tehran). My only quibble were the occasional what were meant to be aerial shots of Tehran with the Alborz mountains in the backdrop showing their CGI origins. But that's a minor quibble. All in all, a really terrific movie that grips you from beginning to end even though we, the audience, know how it will end. And Affleck accomplished all this on a lean and mean budget. See. It can still be done.I'm left wondering where Mr. Affleck's going next. If it's anywhere like Argo, I'll be there.",10,2,5,25 October 2012
Nightcrawler," Sociopath on the rise
","Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a fast-learning young man striving to find his niche. If this involves theft, well, then he steals. He does what he needs to do to survive in this world red in tooth and claw. And he will claw his way up and out like an alien beast hellbent on smashing through the barriers that are blocking his existence.I must comment on Gyllenhaal's appearance in this movie. For this role he dropped a little weight and gave Bloom one of the leanest and hungriest looks I've ever seen with searching raygun eyes bulging out of their sockets ready to pounce on anything even faintly smelling of an opportunity to be grabbed and swallowed whole.At the beginning we catch him in the dead of night clipping off chunks from a chainlink fence with heavy weight pruning shears. Confronted by a security guard he at first claims to be lost, but then without warning he lashes out like a coiled serpent and strikes the man down. In the next scene we see him driving away admiring the man's wristwatch, which is now on his own wrist. At a scrapmetal company, he attempts to peddle the metal scrap he's stolen. Regurgitating a non-stop ratatat spiel, he frantically tries to cajole the scrapyard's owner to hire him. The owner cases him over carefully with a wary eye and snarls, 'I don't hire thieves.' Bloom gives him a wry smile and mutely walks out the door. He must claw harder.Chastised and frustrated Bloom leaves dejected, driving off into the dark night. Cruising along one of the interminable LA freeways trying to figure out what to try next, by sheer chance he spots a car that has overturned at the side of the freeway. By sheer instinct he pulls over and gets out. A woman is trapped inside the car, which threatens to burst into flames at any minute. Two policemen are desperately trying to pull her out before the car flames up. A man, not a cop, is there frantically taking videos of the entire scene with hand-held camcorder. Bloom becomes instantly intrigued. He hears the man as he's calling to sell his tape to the highest bidding TV station as a stunner to open the early morning newscast. Bloom can feel the rush of adrenaline and excitement in this kind of work. He's hooked.At Venice beach he steals an expensive bicycle and trades it to a pawn dealer for a camcorder and police scanner. Armed with these he tries out this new game for himself and discovers he likes it. Likes it a lot as it turns out. Soon he's off making his own nocturnal forays across the city seeking out horrific accidents and shocking crimes, turning them into videos and hustling them to TV studios as blood-splashing openers for the morning news. Very quickly he lands on a particular TV studio to sell his wares to and obsequiously schmoozes up to the morning news director, Nina Romina (Rene Russo), a woman who herself has clawed her way to the top. She recognizes another clawer in Louis Bloom at first glance.At first Nina's in control but as Bloom's business picks up, he hires a down-and-out as his assistant, Rick (Riz Ahmed), and pretty soon he's turned the tables on her. He starts calling the shots and demanding more and more privileges and recognition. He's the master of the videos-for-hot-news game. But then he experiences a few setbacks. Nina shouts at him and berates him. He desperately needs a big story to sell the station on. And he lucks out. He gets a blasting hot one. Two thugs shoot a man, his wife, and their housemaid in their plush suburban mansion in Granada Hills. Bloom catches it all on his video recorder, including the license plate of the SUV the murderers flee in, all before the police arrive at the scene. The police are furious at him and want his footage.Perusing his video Bloom realizes he had the license plate of the SUV, which he excises from the film so that the police can't see it. He wants to get even more bang from his video. And this leads to the denouement when Bloom's true colors come out in a shocking revelation. To enhance his business and career he's willing to create a shootout setup to film leading-edge video coverage for the morning news. Rick (recently promoted to Executive Vice President of Bloom's business in an attempt to satisfy him) is aghast. At this point Bloom says to him, 'What if I told you I really don't like people.' Rick doesn't want to have any part of it but finally Bloom gets him to take footage. But Rick pays dearly for his insubordination. And in the end Bloom's video news business blooms.Bloom exhibits a sociopathic personality. A person who uses other human beings as rungs to climb to the top, whatever that top happens to be. Or if you will, fodder for their success. Like Rick. And I've heard several psychologists claim sociopaths are much more common than one would image. Many of them will do drastic things to you if you cross them. Like Bloom.The acting's outstanding. I've seen Gyllenhaal in several movies and he always turns in a great performance. And his lead characters aren't always flattering. Like Louis Bloom. I don't purposefully see a movie because a particular actor's in it but I find myself seeing a bunch of movies with a particular actor in them because that actor's plainly superb. Like the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Or Gyllenhaal. The supporting actors are good too. Especially so Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed. Kent Shocknek has a cameo role as a male news anchor at the TV station. Not a difficult role for him to play I would imagine. The directing and cinematography are good, and the movie moves along well.10/10",10,3,5,11 January 2015
Foxcatcher," A modern tragedy
","In spite of dealing with the sport of wrestling, this movie is not primarily an action movie. And like any movie it must rely on acting, directing, and script. Foxcatcher is no exception, and all three are outstanding, especially the acting, which is superb.Based on a true story, it is above all the story of three men: Dave Schultz, Mark Schultz, and John Eleuthère (aka the Golden Eagle) du Pont, heir to the immense Du Pont fortune. Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo), an American Olympic and world champion freestyle wrestler and a seven-time World and Olympic medalist, is the most normal of the three with a loving wife and two children whom he adores. Dave is a good man and an outstanding wrestling coach. And in addition to his family, Dave sincerely loves his younger brother, Mark (Channing Tatum), also an Olympic medalist (1984). Both shared a difficult childhood that left its effect on both of them and Dave watches out for Mark and is concerned about him. And Mark admits Dave was the only real friend he had in childhood.Mark is the more problematic of the two brothers. Not terribly articulate or knowledgeable about the world, unmarried and going nowhere in his career, he receives a phone call from a man working for John du Pont. Du Pont wants Mark to come and train at his wrestling training center on his Foxcatcher Farm in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where he is to be groomed as a top wrestler for the upcoming 1988 Olympics. Mark accepts the invitation, an action that sets in motion everything that transpires all the way to its inevitable dark end. Like a stack of dominoes falling down one after another until none are left standing.But of the three men John du Pont (Steve Carell) is by far the most problematic. If neuroses took the form of porcupine quills, du Pont would have looked like a two-legged porcupine. The nice thing about Foxcatcher is it doesn't shove du Pont's neuroses down your throat. They are suggested by subtle hints in body language, dialogue, scene, and action, and Carell gives an absolutely amazing performance in his rendition of this deeply troubled man. And Vanessa Redgravc gives an outstanding cameo rendition of John du Pont's manipulative mother, Jean du Pont.It's fair to say that John du Pont destroyed both Dave Schultz and Mark Schultz in his vain ambition to be mentor, leader, brother, and father to the wrestlers training at his wrestling training center. A man who expected his money to control everything, it couldn't control his own hidden desires that ultimately destroyed him too.A strong connection exists between this story and Ancient Greece. Not only does the story unfold like a real-life Greek tragedy, but wrestling matches played a prominent part in the games of the Ancient Greek Olympics.As an aside, Carell is known for his comedy, but he should consider more serious roles because he clearly has the talent to pull them off very effectively. I'd love to see what he could do with Julius Caesar.10/10",10,6,14,3 January 2015
It Follows," It follows what?
","I saw this movie based on a movie review in a national magazine to which I subscribe The magazine gave it a 4 out of 4. Based on this review, I saw the movie. I have no idea what the reviewer was thinking of. On this rating scale I'd give it a 1.5. At very best a 2. The music score was pretty good.This movie could have been called Young Adult Angst in Spades. There are few adults in the movie and those that do occasionally show up have minute parts that last a few moments. They could easily have been left out entirely. The movie plays on the worst fears of a young adult. To be followed by some creepy guy or woman who shows up unexpectedly when you were just feeling safe and secure. The only new spin the movie gives it is all this is a curse brought on by having sex with someone who already has the curse.Jay (Maika Monroe) has a date with a guy (Jake Weary) to see a movie. Shown in a movie theater that looked like one straight out of the 1940s BTW (nothing wrong with that-surprised it's still around). The guy has the curse and he takes Jay to a strange deserted parking structure and they make love. Not an exactly romantic place to make love in but fits in with the creepy theme. After the love making they see a creepy creature creeping towards them. Slowly. And I mean slowly.So, Jay now catches sight of creepy creatures creeping slowly towards her all over the place. This really freaks her out. Kelly (Lili Sepe), Jay's sister, and Paul (Keir Gilchrist), Kelly's boyfriend, try to help Jay rid herself of the creepy creatures. As an aside, at the beginning of the movie it's suggested that if you get tired of creepy creatures creeping slowly towards you and you just give up, they eventually catch up with you and rip your limbs off. But Jay doesn't know this.Anyway, Kelly is OK with Paul sleeping with Jay so the curse will be passed on to him (Paul's been lusting after Jay for a long time anyway so this works for him). They make love and then wait in dire expectation. But nothing happens. True love triumphs over the curse of the creepy creatures creeping slowly? It's hard to make a really good spook movie. I'll concede that. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece in this genre, The Shining, raised the bar awfully high. If you're going to make one, probably best to create a good bit of psychological scaffolding to support the spook part, as the recent The Babadook did.A 4 out of 10. As I said, the music score was pretty good. And that old theater (guess it still exists in Detroit). Wow! I liked that.",4,9,54,15 May 2015
Ex Machina," Sci-fi? Or right around the corner?
","At last, a sci-fi movie that combines brains, suspense, a captivating android, and a 3-player poker game where the first player knows what the second one is going to do but isn't sure about the third one. No blow-'em-ups effects needed here. In fact the most stunning special effect is Ava's quasi-robotic, and erotic, android body and Alicia Vikander plays her to perfection. Nathan (Oscar Isaac) is an eccentric recluse who has founded the largest and best online search engine company in the world, BlueBook (named after the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's lecture notes from 1933-34―the other being the Brown Book which addressed 1934-35). A software genius, Nathan wrote the entire code needed to start BlueBook from scratch at the age of 13 and it has made him a multibillionaire enabling him to live where he wants to live, how he wants to live, and why he wants to live. The why is embodied in his relentless pursuit. Having founded an outstanding software-based company, he now avidly pursues his passion for strong AI.From his lair (in what I took to be Alaska*) Nathan sets up a computer contest among his employees, ostensibly to discover who is the best programmer. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins the contest and is flown in by private helicopter to Nathan's estate in the midst of a rugged and incredibly beautiful wilderness landscape to meet Nathan. A significant honor for Caleb. Except that he doesn't know at this time he won the contest because he was wired to win.Nathan's mansion functions also as his entirely private research facility, and he is determined to take strong AI all the way to its predestined epiphany: the creation of a fully functional android that can pass as human in any and all circumstances whatever. Ava is his hottest latest creation. A walking, talking, android robot who except for some of her obvious robotic features resembles a fully functional human female, and an eye-catcher at that. There's a previous creation around too, Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno). She's Nathan's slave and treated as such.Caleb has a week at Nathan's estate to test Ava to see if she can pass the Turing Test, the sterling litmus test that differentiates a computer from a human being. If the computer passes, it is considered to possess a fully functioning mind capable of decision making and independent thought, a self-conscious awareness of who she is, and along with these her will to survive and her capacity to take pleasure in sexual experiences. For the latter Nathan has furnished her with an artificial vagina with sensors that register pleasure when stimulated. Much of this is part of Kyoko's repertoire too and although she's mute, she's not as dumb as she seems. She does good sex too. And with her master and creator. Some viewers may find this creepy.Caleb is the epitome of the geek. A shy, very bright, introverted young man orphaned at 15 with no brothers or sisters, and no girl friend either. He is all alone in the world. In short, fully open and vulnerable to Ava's charms. Nathan of course knew all this beforehand. He even knows Ava's face fits Caleb's pornography profile of most frequently viewed females. When asked about this, Nathan points out the many advantages of easy access to mine different individual's data through BlueBook. For all these reasons Caleb was the perfect fit. And unknown to him, Nathan has his own version of the Turing Test: Caleb is the front-guy whose strings are being pulled by Nathan―and also by Ava. Ava is a prisoner in Nathan's mountain retreat and has never been allowed out of her room. She longs for freedom. And she also fears that Nathan may decide to 'retire' her and commence on a newer model. Caleb falls in love with her and they plot to escape together.Nathan even warns Caleb. Does she truly love you? Or does she only seem to love you to gain her freedom? Caleb believes the first. A disastrous mistake. Things get dicey. Nathan is murdered. Caleb ends up trapped in Nathan's mansion because the entire power system that controls the locks has been jimmied. He can't escape. He begs Ava to release him. She gives him a wistful glance and then walks out into the open to keep the rendezvous with the waiting helicopter to whisk her away to the freedom she so desperately desires and to free her from her incessant fear of being terminated. And at this point she looks like a fully embodied human being, thanks to some convenient borrowings from some of Nathan's earlier creations.The last scene we see her in a vast square where she stands very pleased with herself, glancing at human beings walking by and treating her like 'anyone' else. She has passed the Turing Test with flying colors. A being fully cognizant of her powers and fully capable of feigning love and of treacherous deceit. A true human being. Or is she?As an aside, strong AI opens both many ethical (a religious person would say, moral) issues and technological issues. Can a creature made from synthetic electronic circuits and programmed like any other computer fully function as a human being? Would such a creature be able to reproduce? Which is one of the most salient features of all life on Earth. And just because we can do something, should we do it? And how would such a creature be energized? Great strides have been made in battery technology. But a battery that only requires to be charged once a century is still far off. And the use of any battery system would still have to depend on a reliable source of electricity, such as the Grid.I hope Alex Garland will continue directing sci-fi movies. With Ex Machina he's created a high bar for himself.I give it 10 out of 10.* Norway actually.",10,4,12,14 May 2015
The Imitation Game," The enigma who broke the Enigma
","The enigma of course being Alan Turing. Did Alan Turing break the German Enigma code all by himself? Of course not. The movie does suggest without Turing it would never have been done. True or false? One of those questions rather difficult to answer, so let's just say Turing was a math genius (or maths genius) whose seminal work in artificial intelligence drastically changed the world and the course of World War II. And in the movie he comes across as the kind of guy who is completely wrapped up in his ideas on computing and breaking the Enigma code and concomitant with this is uncomfortable around other people and having to deal with them. From what I know of him, this is an accurate portrayal.The movie perfectly captures the state of Britain in the early years of the war (4 August 1939 through early 1942). Once France was knocked out of the war by the triumphant German Army (June 1940) and the Soviet Union still allied to Nazi Germany, Britain was completely isolated and facing a Europe either under direct Nazi control or allied with Germany. The Blitz, the strategic bombing campaign conducted by the Germans on Britain, ran from September 1940 through May 1941. The German Luftwaffe routinely bombed major cities in Britain, and because of Hitler's mania (the British dared to bomb Berlin the night of 25 August 1940), Hitler had the Luftwaffe specifically target London. The devastation was enormous. Add to this the unrelenting submarine warfare Germany was conducting on British shipping, and also US ships carrying aid (the US was not officially in WW II until 7 December 1941), Britain was suffering severely from the war. In truth it was losing it. And one of the chief means the Germans used for communications was the Enigma code. The British had to decipher it―or face losing the war.Enter Bletchley Park and Alan Turing. Bletchley Park was the top-secret location where the British were desperately trying to break the Enigma code, and Turing greatly helped to facilitate this achievement. Turing was clearly a man who lived in his own world of ideas, ideas so out of the ordinary (at that time) that very few people could grasp them. And he often did a poor job of communicating effectively those then strange and bizarre, but brilliant, ideas to other people. All these things come across quite clearly in the movie.I've read several criticisms that claim the movie leaves much out. For example, Turing traveled to the US doing the time period that the movie covers. So what? To cover all these details would have made the movie inordinately long. Suitable for a book. Not for a movie.Is the movie entertaining? Most certainly yes. You feel you're right there in the midst of the action at all times. The acting is splendid. As I said, the movie captures the dangerous predicament that Britain was in at the time. Regarding casting, Turing wasn't a bad looking man, but he was no Benedict Cumberbatch. And Ms. Joan Clarke? Not exactly a Keira Knightley. Again, so what? They did a great job in acting in their portrayal of Turing and Clarke. The supporting cast is good too. And Cumberbatch's and Knightley's presence undoubtedly help sell the movie to the general public, many of whom probably never heard of Turing and might never have were it not for this movie.Regarding Turing's homosexuality, today we wonder what the fuss was all about. Although the movie doesn't downplay it, it doesn't make it the primary focus either. It was though what ultimately led him to take his own life. Turing's fate is a true shame. One wonders what he might have dreamed up if he had lived his full span of years.Highly recommended. 10/10",10,3,10,30 January 2015
Prisoners," Well done psychodrama
","I won't add much about the plot because that's already been done in spades. The title Prisoners is very apt for this movie, which focuses heavily on the effect that the disappearance of two young girls has on their families, the police detective who is investigating their disappearance, and a mentally retarded young man whose RV is connected with the crime and who may be, or may not be, the perpetrator.The girls disappear right under the noses of their parents and siblings. They all must cope with the abduction, but the father of one of the girls, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), has sworn to protect his family and reacts, often violently, to the intense stress put on him for his dereliction of duty. He kidnaps the mentally retarded young man, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), and tortures him in an abandoned apartment building, hoping to beat out of him the whereabouts of his daughter. His wife, Grace (Maria Bello) resorts to prescription drugs to deal with her loss. The other parents are bereft too. The other father (Terrence Howard) reluctantly ends up aiding Dover in the torture. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is able to relate the crime to some earlier abductions that had never been solved. He also must endure Dover's almost incessant raves that he (Loki) is mishandling the case. Eventually Dover's accusations get under his skin. Several clues are given who the real perpetrator is but they're easy to miss.The action takes place between Thanksgiving and Christmas in a small Pennsylvania town, so the weather is gloomy and overcast, often raining or snowing. Very appropriate for such a dark movie. A poignant scene is Keller Dover on his knees begging forgiveness from Jones, who's been sealed in a wooden closet for torture with only a small hole to look out of. If you grew up Catholic, it'll remind you of a penitent confessing to a priest in his darkened booth in the confessional. And Keller Dover, although driven by his demons, is a deeply religious man (he wears a cross on a chain around his neck) and is well aware he's committing mortal sin. But he'll do anything, including sacrificing his own life, to find his daughter.The ending is ambiguous in one sense. Although the perpetrator of the crimes receives justice, Keller Dover may, or may not, die in a very disquieting manner. Viewer's choice.The acting is first-rate, as well as the script and directing. If you can handle a very dark theme done in a very realistic way, then I'd highly recommend this movie.",9,2,4,1 November 2013
The Witch," Witches really do exist. Well, don't they? Yes, and No.
","I enjoyed The Witch immensely. The mood it captures so well. A real bone-chilling horror story that conveys full plausibility to the world that it depicts. And the scenery and music help the mood along very nicely.William (Ralph Ineson) and Katherine (Kate Dickie) and their family are expelled over some religious dispute with the elders of a Puritan plantation in early 17th century New England (1630 is the date given). Even the language used throughout the movie is Early Modern English (1500-1700) with its thou-thy/thine-thee 2nd person familiar pronouns-now considered thoroughly archaic. With their children in tow, they tough it out on a small farm somewhere on the outskirts of the plantation, growing Indian corn (aka maize) and raising goats, forbidden to participate further with their brethren in the fortress. This forced isolation from society and other human beings plays a significant role in the movie as does their intense religious practices and beliefs. They take the grace of Christ very seriously as they also do the wickedness of the Devil. The large dense forest near their farm also plays a part in the movie. The focal point of the movie is William's and Katherine's elder daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). She is 14 or 15 in the movie and what today would be called a pubescent teen. She is the oldest child and is tasked to watch over the latest addition to the family, the infant Samuel. While Thomasin is playing peep-a-boo with him, he mysteriously disappears from her sight. The scene shifts briefly to the shocking scene of a strange nude woman bashing the child to death and smearing herself with his blood. William and Katherine are distraught with grief. At first William explains Samuel's disappearance to a wolf. One other incident is worth noting. The two younger children frolic with their large male goat appropriately named Black Phillip. Thomasin is jeered by them as they hold her responsible for Samuel's disappearance. She chases them and asserts that she is the witch of the woods. After this they fear her.After Samuel's disappearance things grow more awry. His father having failed to find game in the forest, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), their eldest son, and Thomasin mounted on the farm's only horse set out in search of game in the thick woods. A large hare stares intensely at them as though it has a mind of its own. Caleb tries to shoot it with his father's blunderbuss but he misses. The shot scares the horse. He bolts and tosses Thomasin to the ground. Caleb runs after the hare deeper and deeper into the forest. Soon he realizes he has lost his way. The forest is dense and scary. He stumbles onto a hut and is greeted by a strange but alluring woman who hugs him to her ample breasts. He returns home several days later delirious with fever and dies mumbling prayers as though he's committed some heinous sin. As the incidents pile up, William and Katherine see something sinister and unholy in all the goings-on and become convinced that Thomasin is a witch and begin accusing her of witchcraft on their children, which she vehemently denies. They are both frantic with fear and loathing and soon they turn on Thomasin. Hysteria and chaos set in. In their struggle to take control of her, William is rammed and killed by Black Phillip. As Katherine tries to strangle her, Thomasin kills Katherine with a knife. In the commotion the two younger children are killed. Thomasin is now all alone expect for Black Phillip. Although not clear, it was hinted that she's also had some kind of sexual relation with him. There is the mysterious scene of the witch seemingly milking a goat, but a more sexual interpretation can clearly be made. Docilely she follows Black Phillip into the barn where she partially disrobes, clothed now only in her tunic.In the darkened barn we see the shadow of a man-creature who speaks to her in a deep male voice, asking her what she wants. To experience the world in all its splendor and glory she tells him. He instructs her to sign allegiance to him. She cannot write she tells him. To which he responds: I shall guide thy hand. At the very end we see Thomasin nude in the woods observing a coven of naked witches dancing around a fire chanting curses and incantations and then hovering lightly in the air, they ascent into the sky. Thomasin has become one of the witches of the woods.Was she a witch? It depends on what angle we view the facts presented to us in the movie. Within the cultural milieu in which she lived, one would have found her guilty of witchcraft. Her punishment would have been death by hanging or being burned at the stake. But what about our present milieu dominated by science? A different angle would be to see a young woman severely constrained by parental authority suffering from a neurological disease that would today be classified as schizophrenia, which often manifests itself in teenage years and early adulthood. In her case characterized by the display of both auditory and visual hallucinations (to a person having these hallucinations they experience them as completely 'real'*), paranoia, and aggrandized modes of thought. And in the cultural milieu and isolation that she experienced, she could easily believe she had become a follower of the Devil. So, the appropriate answer to the question is, Which milieu does the asker inhabit? To the actors and director, kudos to all of them. A masterpiece horror movie. And one that is open to a sequel.Regarding the archaic English, even though I could follow the conversations reasonably well, I honestly think subtitles would have been helpful. 10 out of 10.* The mathematician, John Nash (1928-2015), learned how to control his hallucinations.",10,3,10,13 March 2016
12 Years a Slave," An amazing movie
","Toward the end of the movie Platt, a field slave, reveals his story to an itinerant carpenter, Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt in a cameo role), who remarks 'you have an amazing story to tell, but it's not pleasant.' For 'Platt' is Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a legally freed man from New York state. Platt is his a slave name literally beaten into him after his kidnapping in Washington City in 1841. Kept chained and beaten in a slave pen in Washington City, he and other kidnapped blacks are shipped to New Orleans and sold in slavery.Platt lives a life of horror. A horror so horrendous and unrelenting it's 'amazing.' 12 Years A Slave frequently uses the n-word and this adds immensely to its truthfulness and accuracy. Many whites in the South considered blacks subhuman, hence keeping them as slaves was not only acceptable, it was supported by the Bible, or at least their twisted interpretation of it.Some of the slavers (wealthy, privileged plantation owners who formed the backbone of the ante-bellum South) were reasonably decent men: Ford, Judge Turner. But the slavery system made the slavers wealthy men and they all bought into the economic system that made them rich and prosperous. And their white underlings were savagely racist to the core. It's a fact the less fortunate ape the wealthy. Look around today. That behavior's still out there in spades. The wealthy do it and ten years later everyone wants to do it, or at least wish they could do it. And with our Twitters and Facebooks it doesn't even take ten years anymore. A celebrity does it today and ten seconds later everyone wants to do it.Northup tries to keep up hope but finally is full of despair, signified by his watching the last embers of a letter he intended to send to his wife but instead burned and also by the purposeful destruction of his violin. He's afraid to even trust a white man. It's only Bass's outspoken abolitionist opinions that make Northup trust him. And it's through Bass's help that Solomon Northup is finally freed from the total hellhole on Earth that was Edwin Epps's plantation. I found myself wondering what happened to all those poor, desperate people that he left behind.The acting in this movie is superb. In particular Chiwetel Ejiofor stands out as Solomon Northup/Platt and the sufferings he endures day after day. Michael Fassbender does an outstanding job portraying Edwin Epps the sad, sadistic, paranoid, megalomaniac, depraved human being whose humanity still comes through. And every other actor plays their part to a tee. The scenery, costumes, and settings were absolutely fantastic. From capturing Washington City in 1841 to the large plantations in the Deep South, Steve McQueen and his crew recreated a totally convincing ante-bellum South in minute detail. I certainly hope this movie garners a bunch of Academy Awards this coming February. It richly deserves them.On a philosophical level the movie broaches slavery as an institution. Should human beings be sold to other human beings as chattel? Anthropological evidence suggests hunter-gatherers probably didn't indulge in it much. But every civilization in existence from 3000 BC onward had either slaves outright or those that were one step up (serfs). The late anthropologist-philosopher, Ernest Gellner, called the people who claw their way to the top of a society either by force or by chicanery, the thugs. And there are still plenty of thugs around. Someone has to do society's dirty work. And so the slave trade came into existence. And there are still slaves around too. People who are forced into indebted servitude against their will where their chances of escaping are virtually nil.To wrap up, a truly gripping and powerful movie, but definitely not for those who prefer to avoid the realities of life and who like nice, cheery, feel-good stories. Not for those either who like blow-'em-ups/ shoot-'em-ups. Many of the scenes are very brutal and very intense.This movie will make you ponder in depth the inhumanity and abject cruelty some humans do to other humans. And it's still going on out there in spades in many parts of the world. Maybe this movie will make us think more deeply how it might be stopped. I sure hope so.",10,4,7,15 November 2013
Arrival," Disappointing
","I really enjoy good sci-fi movies and look forward to them when they come out. I saw good reviews of Arrival and was anxious to see it when it came to the movie theaters. Although Arrival has some very good actors in it, Amy Adams (American Hustle), Jeremy Renner (The Immigrant), Forest Whittaker (The Last King of Scotland), the script is implausible and the action drags along at a snails pace. I say the script is implausible for two reasons: (1) Linguists have had knowledge of the existence of Cretan Linear A for over a century, but no linguist to date had had any success in translating it (unlike Cretan Linear B). This demonstrates how difficult it is to decode a strange script, even if one form of it (Cretan Linear B) has been successfully tackled. That is why the deciphering of the squids' writing system in Arrival seems totally implausible. (2) Also, if the squids have the technology to create spaceships that can traverse quadrillions of miles of space and defy gravity when they land, they could certainly have created a device to translate their language into Earth languages and vice versa. As I assume that Arrival isn't meant to be fantasy, both of these issues are serious plausibility gaps in the movie. The depiction of the squids languidly swishing back and forth in a large sealed vat of smoky liquid (or gas--I couldn't tell) looked amateurish. In addition, as I mentioned above, the movie moves along incredibly slowly. Except for the Amy Adams character, the rest were one-dimensional. Conclusion: I get it. The squids bring all humans together as one. They're good guys and they want us all to get along and play nice together. And in 3000 years they'll call on us for help. Have a visit by aliens (good ones of course) and we'll all have peace on Earth. What a peachy ending. Boy, if only it were that simple. Overrated. Mediocre at best. Too bad because it has some good actors in it. A better script and better special effects would have helped. 5 out of 10. Good try though.",5,7,14,30 December 2016
Prometheus," Great Expectations
","Three stars out of ten I read a review of this movie in a national mag I subscribe to and the mag gave it a good review (three stars out of four). I was looking forward to it since I like sci-fi movies and haven't seen a good one in a long time. Good point: Nice special effects which looked convincing. Met my expectations.Problems with the movie: 1) Granted it's sci-fi, still the movie implies, in direct contradiction to modern biology, that human beings, aka Homo sapiens, had a special extraterrestrial origin. Even a biologist in the movie scoffs at this idea, but he's finished off early in the movie along with an anti-social geologist. I didn't see the need to take this position except to appeal to religious types who do believe this (hey, they think Earth was created about 6,000 years ago too).2) Then there's the thinly veiled philosophical issue: Where did we (aka H. sapiens) really come from if we somehow sprang up from somewhere else? At the movie's beginning two archaeologists (Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) discover remarkable cave paintings, carvings on steles, etc. from many ancient civilizations pointing to a particular constellation. The two archaeologists conclude the planet where we, the human race, supposedly originated is to be found in this constellation. After this they're on a quest to discover our origins. Financed by a private corporation (Theron plays the CEO's daughter) a team of scientists, including the two archaeologists, go off to this mysterious planet. Does the team learn where we really come from? Nope. They find evidence that an earlier group of 'men' reached the planet about 2,000 years before. Except for one 'man', the entire crew of these predecessors were all killed off in some mysterious way. A sample of the one of the dead 'men's' DNA is taken by the team, and an exact match is found of their DNA to our own. Conclusion: these guys were our forebears.But these guys were arming a spacecraft with WMDs and ready to fly off to Earth to destroy humanity (their descendants). Why? That becomes the BIG question, presumably to be resolved in a sequel. This one guy left who wasn't killed off 2,000 years ago goes berserk and kills a whole bunch of the team, including ripping David's (Michael Fassbender) head off. This doesn't kill David although it's a real inconvenience to be left with only a head but no body. But he's an android after all―think of the android in Alien. Apparently the guy, our forebear, didn't think highly of what humanity has turned into. Given how buff and tall he was, maybe he thought we'd all turned into a bunch of weak wimps that deserved death. The forebear-guy dies by being crushed by a creature resembling a giant squid (wasn't clear to me where it came from), but not before being implanted with an egg by this creature. However, the offspring that comes ripping out of his body looks like ... again, think of Alien.Hence no way to ask the forebear-guy: Where the heck did you come from? since he's dead. Taking that all the way back, one could presumably trace our lineage back to 'the big guy in the sky', or anywhere else you'd like it to be. The movie ends with one of the archaeologists (Rapace, the Marshall-Green character dies from a mysterious disease) setting to depart on a journey to discover where we ultimately come from. The answer presumably to be resolved in a sequel.3) Okay so the director was Ridley Scott who created Alien. And this movie was intended to be a prequel. So what? Still the Alien thing was way overdone. Too many people also. Who were they? The crew in Alien was a much more compact number. This movie could have been more outstanding since it did have an auspicious beginning. It desperately cried out for a better script and better character development. It also needed more emphasis on science and a lot less on religion. Science itself is awe-inspiring enough. At least for those who know what it's really all about.4) Finally the acting. The term 'wooden' comes to mind. This is most probably due to the overcooked and vapid script. Someone reviewing this movie said he just couldn't get into the characters. Ditto for me. The only one who did a halfway decent job was Fassbender, but he had more to do in the movie than most of the others. Charlize Theron, whom I normally like, came across as a bloodless robot. Maybe she was the robot and Fassbender wasn't. Whatever. This movie seriously needed a Ripley and Noomi Rapace wasn't the gal. End result: Big disappointment. To paraphrase Groucho Marx: I've seen good sci-fi, but this wasn't it.",3,2,4,5 October 2012
Identity," Very disappointing
","The only thing that I can charitably say about this film is, thank god it isn't a comic book made into a movie. Although the acting is passable, the script is wooden. I found myself wondering why fine actors like John Cusack and Ray Liotta would star in something like this, but I guess it was a job.Although the film's story line doesn't lack imagination, it is simply not believable. For me to explain why would be to reveal the ending. Like so many movies today, this one pushes the idea that ghosts and paranormal phenomena are real and that we should believe in them.If this film is a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock (as one commenter suggests), then all I can say is the makers pay him poor tribute. Hitchcock always grounded his films in unflinching realism. That is why he was a master. He relied only on human motivation and psychology to underpin the behavior of his characters. Nevertheless, he succeeded in chilling us to the bone without invoking the supernatural, preternatural, or any other beyond-the-natural. And the ending is total rubbish.I give it 3/10. And a 3 solely because John Cusack and Ray Liotta are in it.",3,1,5,17 May 2014
Inside Llewyn Davis," Oh! What an unlucky man he was
","Llewyn Davis's (Oscar Isaac) life is scattered and fragmented into bits and pieces as he seeks to make it as a folk singer in Greenwich Village's 1961 music scene.Many reviews of this movie comment that Llewyn is unsympathetic, rude, an asshole, out of touch, obnoxious, unrelatable to, etc. etc. Personally I think the Coen brothers set out to make a movie about a character struggling to make it in a profession that is incredibly difficult to 'make it in.' You need talent. Sure. But you also need luck. Or whatever you want to call it: fortuitous circumstances; a fairy angel over your shoulder; serendipitous connections; being in the right place at the right time.Llewyn has talent. Yes. Luck? No. Things just don't pan out for him. Partly because of his personality. Partly because of circumstances. It doesn't help that he comes from a working class background. His father was a seaman. Llewyn put in a stint as a seaman. The $11,500 his family's house sold for is going to pay for his dad's upkeep at a nursing facility. Money's tight. He ends up, like many artists did, sleeping over on someone's couch or bumming money off someone. What I didn't see too much evidence of were booze and grass, which would have been floating around aplenty in early '60s Greenwich Village.The music scene in 1961 was beginning to morph as the social climate changed. The year 1964 saw the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley. The Vietnam war was heating up. American values were changing at an ever increasing pace, especially among younger Americans. The Counterculture was beginning to emerge. Certain musicians were there at that moment and captured in haunting lyrics the seriousness of the changes taking place and rode the wave.In the very last scenes Llewyn is tipped off by Jean (Carey Mulligan) that he has a chance to make it that night at The Gaslight in the Village where a NY Times critic is going to be in the audience. He strums on his guitar and sings a wonderful, evocative 'Hang me, oh hang me.' But the next musician to follow him is Bob Dylan. Dylan's unique style, raspy piercing unforgettable voice, and musical poetry hit the scene. And Dylan rode the wave. And Dylan went through his own set of hardships on the rocky road to success. One man doesn't make it. One man does. That's how life works. No one said it was fair.This movie doesn't have the whacky offbeat craziness and absurdity of some Coen movies like Fargo and The Big Lebowski, which is okay by me. Possibly the most engrossing character in the movie is the crippled irascible but eloquent jazz musician, Roland Turner (John Goodman), who occupies the backseat of a car heading for Chicago that Llewyn has hitchhiked himself into. He continually pokes Llewyn with one of his canes to make his point (he carries two to walk with because of his disability). Turner is a certifiable Coen-type character and Goodman renders him impeccably.The acting is well done. The story is circular. Where Llewyn's life is at the movie's beginning is where it is at the end. Nowhere. A talented musician who couldn't smash through the barrier. One other point. The movie captures to a tee both the atmosphere and the brutal winter weather of NYC and Chicago in the early '60s. Winter in both cities makes Llewyn's lot in life even more a hardship. Still most definitely worth a watch.8/10",8,1,4,22 December 2013
Mad Max: Fury Road," In a world that's gone insane, only chaos can reign
","That's the world of Mad Max Fury Road. Our world. Earth. As it is in the forthcoming future. A desert planet where once was green vegetation is now only sand and salt (dried out ocean beds). And hostile tribes of different peoples, some possibly mutants, war with each other for scarce resources, one of most scarce being water.The plot is simplicity itself. A powerful warlord and cult-leader, the ugly and evil Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who wears a hideous mouth mask, holds power supreme over an impoverished people. From his balcony at the Citadel, his stronghold, like a beneficent god he opens three floodgates, allowing gushing water to fall to the waiting masses below.He also has a private harem, and a wandering woman, Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has stolen five of them, all beauties, because she must rescue them (she alludes to being abducted as a child from her native land and perhaps serviced such a warlord herself). She drives off into the desert with a truck holding a tank-load of gasoline and with the women safely stowed away in the passenger compartment.Unknown to her Max (Tom Hardy), an itinerant wanderer overwhelmed with guilt by the death of his wife and daughter that he could not prevent, captured and tortured by the warlord's warriors, escapes and hitches a ride on Furiosa's truck. Wary of each other at first, they come to terms and are soon cooperating. Which is a good thing.Because the warlord learns that five of his beautiful sex slaves, one prominently pregnant, have been abducted. Brimming with rage he storms out after her with his army of goons into the barren desert in full pursuit to capture his women and carry them back and in the process destroy Furiosa. And so the battle begins.The goon army armed to the teeth and plowing through the desert in their makeshift but deadly vehicles with their banners flapping in the breeze and their massive oversized tires and their strange music filling the air and pursuing with full and deadly fury Furiosas'a truck and savoring the sweet revenge that they will unleash on her when they catch up with her looks for all purposes like some malevolent caravan of motley beasts guided by miscreant creatures straight out of the Wizard of Oz. Or the gates of Hell.Furiosa sees her deed as a way of finding redemption, partly because she herself must have served some warlord. Max tells her: If you can't fix what's broken, you will go insane. She must face the fact that the land she left, her green land, is forever gone. Max tells her in order to find the green land again, she must return to the Citadel. Furiosa with Max's help, and also with the help of the young women whom she's rescued, must battle the warlord's warriors all the way back. And what a fight. Total mayhem like so many wars. Vicious and merciless. And fought to the bitter end.Normally I don't much care for blow-'em-ups/shoot-'em-ups and this movie has it in spades, far enough to satisfy the most hard-bitten action junkie. But from a review, I read that Charlize Theron was in the movie, and playing the main character to boot. It's as much her movie as it is Hardy's. Possibly even more so. Normally I don't see a movie because a particular actor's in it, but I've seen her in several movies and she's very good.The cinematography is outstanding. Most of the movie was filmed in the Namib desert in Namibia, an African republic to the northwest of South Africa. The red desert with its large, forbidding rock formations is stunning. And the formidable sandstorm that rushes down on them like an enormous tsunami is incredible. I have a scene like that in a book I wrote. But words must be chosen very carefully and even then it remains challenging to capture the moving action of such a titanic thing. The music convincingly supports the militant and life-or-death hand-to-hand fighting taking place. Brutality begets the beast. It's my understanding that very few of the scenes were CGI-generated (the great sandstorm must have been though). If that is so, then I must say they are all splendidly done. Kudos to Miller for his directing.I give it 10 out of 10. I'd like to say a bit about my ratings. I read one reviewer who said he doesn't like to give any movie a 10 out of 10 because it can always be made better. If one looks at a movie like any other work of art, this is true. No work of art exists, or will ever exist, that somehow couldn't stand a bit of improvement. I'm a writer and know that myself. An artist must do the very best job they can with the skills they possess. But that being said, the work must end so the artist can reach their audience. Otherwise, the work of art is a perpetual ongoing project. So, if the directing, script, acting, score, and cinematography are of very high quality, then I give it 10 out of 10. Yes, it could probably have been worked on more. But then, there would never be a movie that could actually be seen by viewers like me.I vaguely remember the original Mad Max series from the 1980s and they struck me as tongue-in-cheek (notwithstanding Miller wrote and directed these too). As far as I was concerned, they could have taken place in a galaxy far, far away. But not so this Mad Max. If you get beyond the action, there's a hard look at where the future of this planet may be heading in the not so distant future. And it's not a pretty future.",10,4,10,24 May 2015
