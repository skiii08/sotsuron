Ford v Ferrari," What a ride...
","This movie was tremendously exhilarating, I found myself pumped with energy all the way through. Also, the score... the score kept me going. Beautiful story, which I vaguely knew of, it was perfectly written and executed. That being said, Matt Damon and Christian Bale made the perfect combination, they managed to portray their characters to perfection, they had great chemistry and I hope I get to see them working together again in the future. Once again Bale steals the show, what an actor.
1000% recommended watch. Even if you knew the story or not, this film will give you that thrill. Incredible, very well deserved Oscar nominations!",10,2,3,19 January 2020
Train to Busan," Best zombie film out there
","I just came around to watch this film, I don't get why it isn't rated higher. It has it all, the greedy, the selfless, the one who changes, I consider it to be the most original zombie movie out there, by far, and a tearjerker even. Excellent production, writing and cast. Another great movie crossed out from the list!",9,3,5,1 March 2020
Knives Out," Unexpectedly fun
","I thought I was done with this type of murder mystery/who did it movie. Still it was very fun to watch, with an excellent cast and an excellent setting, Knives Out proved me wrong when I thought I've seen just about every twist for this type of movie. Plot kept getting better and better, what a relief!",8,2,4,29 December 2019
Tropic Thunder," One of my favorite comedies!
","I absolutely adore this movie, it cracks me up every time I watch it.
I believe the only white person allowed to play an Australian actor, playing a black military man is RDJ. Jack Black was also very convincing and amazing in this movie. And I can only say good things about the rest of the cast.
An instant classic, quotable movie.
I recommend watching the commentary and interviews related to this film, just as fun experience as watching the movie.
If you like dumb, dark comedies, this one is a must!!",9,2,2,18 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I get it...
","I understand why some viewers might find this boring and not at all QT's style. But I really thought it was very well executed. As Tarantino said, it is a Love letter to LA. The time period setting was outstanding and the 60's vibe was amazing. Brad Pitt's character was by far the most interesting and fun in the whole film, great acting and perfect chemistry between him and DiCaprio. It was a great story with fun comedic scenes and characters. I recommend watching it.If you manage to get through the whole movie, the last 15 minutes won't disappoint at all, there's a very good action/violent Tarantino scene that we all know and love.Also, I loved the fact that he mixed historical facts and real people with fictional characters and events. The one thing that kept me waiting was the ending, if you know the real story you'll know what I'm talking about.",9,5,9,13 January 2020
Joker," Psychological Masterpiece
","For those going to watch it I seriously recomend paying close attention to the progression of his mental illness, do not watch this movie just to say you saw it. Try and admire every aspect on how he got to be the Joker. It is trully a Masterpiece!!Going in, I knew I was going to watch a good movie. I am very surprised by the public's positive reaction to the movie, I never would have thought that everyone would actually get the complex character development Phoenix portrays. Absolutely mesmerizing performance by Joaquin. I loved how not everything was as it seemed and still got to dive in so deep into the Joker's mental issues. What I also liked about the movie was the fact that even though he was seemingly unstable, he could actually control his emotions by dancing and relaxing, by not breathing and coping with anxiety, by mimicking the people around him. I also really liked the scene were he trashes the picture signed by TW. It showed the audience that even if his origin was a lie or not, it still didnt matter, there was no turning back from all the physical and mental abuse he suffered as a child and the innevitable becoming of the Joker character.Very very pleased this was not another superhero flick, I really like this human portrayal of beloved comic book characters. Trully exceptional, Todd Phillips really went all out on this one!",10,1,2,27 October 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Everythin I expected
","First things first, I love Taika.
This movie made me laugh and made me cry. Such a beautiful film with great actors and great cinematography. It was an extraordinary experience with a great message, definetly one of my favorite films of the year. Jojo Rabbit is a great example of comedy, satire and drama all together, very exciting and visually stunning. A must watch.",9,3,8,12 January 2020
