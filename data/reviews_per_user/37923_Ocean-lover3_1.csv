The Avengers," I have a question
","From what i have seen this will be the greatest superhero movie of all time. But i have a question that needs answering from anyone who has seen the film already: does this film have an f word or a g-dd-mn in it? I have been waiting for this film since Iron Man in 2008. I hate that kind of cursing and i want to see this really bad. The characters are deep and well acted, the dialog is smart and clever, the action is incredible and i don't want to not get to see it should it have those words in it. Captain Anerica was my favorite of the Marvel movies so far. And so far, Marvel has managed to keep their movies clean( relatively). The incredible hulk had a GD in it and thats what worries me about this film. I want my family to be able to experience this film and we cant should there be such words.",10,2,7,29 April 2012
