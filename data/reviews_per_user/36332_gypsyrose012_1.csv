Marie Antoinette," Great form of public history
","As a history major working on their masters, I have am well versed in European history and the French Revolution. Though this film does take historical liberties and express primarily one side of this story, I think that it is an excellent example of public history. It is beautifully made, and portrays the glamorous side of royalty as well as the awkward formal rituals of life. Though scholars will certainly disagree with many elements of the film, it does serve a great purpose for the study. This film will open many people's eyes to early 18th century European history, and make them went to go and learn more on the subject. Take a class, read a book and just genuinely be excited. In a time when many feel that History is a lost cause, I think that is a great thing. For those that are going to see the film and expecting a great historical and factual drama, then you will possibly be disappointed. However, if you go in there with an open mind, and appreciate the director's portrayal of these historical figures as real people then you will not be disappointed. I think it is a wonderful film that should be celebrated not condemned.",8,1,3,28 October 2006
