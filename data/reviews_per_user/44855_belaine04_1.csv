Marie Antoinette," Surprisingly different
","When I first heard Marie Antionette was coming out, I thought ' Another history movie'. I am still young but I have always loved the French Revolution. I think the movie was a brave choice is how it was done. I agree that the factual points in the movie aren't very accurate which can cause disappointment. I feel as though this movie went deeper into more than what we can read in a textbook. It shows more of her struggles as being queen and just being young and having a forced marriage. I think it's a movie that younger people can relate too. It's not like watching a 'history movie'. This movie caused me to go and look up more on Marie Antionette. If you are going to watch the movie looking for a bunch of facts and historical items then you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a movie that will tell a different story about Marie Antionette then I suggest you give it a watch.",7,0,1,14 October 2008
