Walk the Line," Movie subtitles did not contain song lyrics
","OK - I agree the movie was really good - however, I was shocked and dismayed that the DVD subtitles did not include the lyrics to the songs. You see, I felt that the songs themselves helped tell the story and I kept thinking while I was watching the movie 'how sad that deaf people cannot see the lyrics of the songs they are seeing so they would also enjoy the movie at that level.'In fact, at one point the subtitles labeled a Bob Dylan song as 'background music' - !!! Shame on the DVD producers for not including the song lyrics - important to the hearing impaired who could not hear the songs for themselves and important to the quality of the movie itself.",8,1,2,10 May 2006
