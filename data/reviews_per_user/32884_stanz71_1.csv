The Blair Witch Project," Not worth it.
","To sum up this movie in one line I would say was awful. It was not scary and from what I had read was at least expecting it to be good. It wasn't even creepy. The lady in the movie drove me up the wall. This was not even realistic, I believe that if she was acting as scared as she was I would be worried about filming myself washing my hands in the river. Also how many batteries did she have for camera. It's ashame that this movie is going to make a killing from all the hype. If you absolutely have to see this movie I suggest try finding a bootleg copy and let the person who made it make the profit instead.",1,1,3,2 August 1999
