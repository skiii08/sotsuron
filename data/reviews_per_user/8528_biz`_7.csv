Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," an excellent addition to the star wars franchise
","yes, it's true, this movie is awesome!despite what's been said about story and character development, i found both aspects to be adequate. people seem to be missing the fact that this sets up the next two movies in the prequel series, which in turn lead into episodes 4,5 and 6. also, the focus on the fact that the outcome of the prequels is known, that being that anakin skywalker becomes darth vader, is misplaced. the important thing is HOW anakin becomes vader and HOW senator palpatine becomes the evil emperor of the corrupt empire.i believe that many critics overlook this fact, thus the poor reviews. but we all know how the original movie was also poorly rated be critics back in 1977, so it comes as no surprise that the most hyped movie of all time would be blasted by a bunch of stuffy, idiotic, so-called movie 'critics'.anyways...ewan macgregor was PERFECT as a young obi-wan. all the performances were great, even jake lloyd, who did a very good job.jar jar binks, hopefully will die by the next installment. the comic relief that jar jar was supposed to provide frankly sucked. totally unfunny clownish antics. die, jar jar, die.i don't need to say anymore about the fx, do i? mind boggling. the fight choreography with obi-wan, qui-gon and darth maul was stellar. just an absolute joy to watch. wow.one of the best movies i have ever seen for pure fun and not too shabby story-wise either. i thought it was a great set up for the next two movies.",10,0,0,26 May 1999
Batman Returns," Not bad...
","This one was almost as good as the first. Unfortunately, the Danny DeVito character ruins the whole show. It would have been a much better movie if Burton had focused on the Catwoman character. But back to the penguin (shudder) and all those stupid FAKE penguins. They looked so stupid. Other than that, not bad.ps- Don't forget the return of Pee Wee Herman!!",Null,1,2,30 October 1998
My Neighbor Totoro," looks great, but...
","in the end i was disappointed. too much focus on satsuke and mei running around the countryside and not enough focus on the relationship between totoro and the girls.but visually, my neighbour totoro is stunning. the style of the characters is pure miyazaki and it was nice to look at.but the story lacked any sort of real cohesiveness. this movie could have been made just as easily without totoro, with a focus on the effect the mother's extended illness has on her two children. on the other hand, this would have been a much better movie if the focus was on the girl's adventures with totoro and his friends inside the giant camphor tree and around the countryside.worth a look either way.",7,2,6,11 January 2000
The Evil Dead," Not bad as horror movies go.
","This is the first and the worst of the Evil Dead movies. Actually, worst isn't a good term. This movie is pretty good and very similar to Evil Dead 2, but it lacks the humour that made the two sequels so good. This movie is basically a kinda gory suspenseful horror. You don't even need to see this one to enjoy the other two because Evil Dead 2 summarizes this one pretty effectively. By all means, go and see it, but don't expect the humour and camp of the other two, which are much better. What you will see is all the same great camera angles and techniques, which work really well in all three movies. Worth seeing.",6,0,1,8 November 1998
2001: A Space Odyssey," Cool flick...
","A very cool movie. The scenes in the Discovery spacecraft are so good. The beginning sequence with the primates is a little too long and boring in my opinion. Also the movie moves very slowly until the end when things pick up a little. Near the end when HAL 9000 starts going goofy, it's very chilling. It's so compelling how a computer can be so malevolent, even though it's a machine and it's unintentional. If you have the patience to sit through a movie that's nearly 2 1/2 hours long, you should go see it.",7,1,3,30 October 1998
Army of Darkness," Groovy.
","This movie is so much fun to watch. A sort of comedy/horror/scifi themed flick. It's gory, funny, suspenseful, and just fun, fun, fun!! You really have to watch it to know. Bruce Campbell should be getting more roles in Hollywood. He's sort of an over-acter, but it works for him. It's not an overblown thing. It's more of a gusto thing. He's great. There's two previous movies in the series, those being Evil Dead, and Evil Dead two. Evil Dead 2 is not quite as good and I'm watching Evil Dead tonight, at long last!Check it out...",9,1,2,4 November 1998
Blade Runner," Simply one of the most incredible movies you can ever experience.
","Blade Runner is one of those movies that one just loves right off the bat. The visuals of course are stunning and along with the dark, dreary mood of futuristic LA pull you into the movie. Be forewarned that the movie is long (director's cut, 117 mins), so you must watch and listen to this movie. But it's worth it. The directors cut is the one to see, as well. The voice over in the theatrical release is unnecesary and the 'happy ending' that the studio had tacked on has been cut. Also there is the odd question raised on the  back of the movie cover that Deckard may himself be a replicant. Something to do with the unicorn dream. As for the performances, all the actors are excellent, especially Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer who incidentally is grossly under-rated as an actor. The man is great in Blade Runner. Also the Vangelis soundtrack is strangely compelling. Once you hear it, you want to own it. If you only buy one movie, ever in your lifetime, buy Blade Runner. It's infinitely watchable.",10,0,0,19 October 1998
