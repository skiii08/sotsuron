The Avengers," superb
","i am sorry to say that avengers is not good movies its really great movie. i was lucky to watch this movie . all actor work great and have many comedy sense, superb action . i've never read comic books. This is a comic book movie. It was made for hardcore fans of comics, and I appreciate the care Joss Whedon gives to this movie. It was very entertaining to see Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury all interact with one another. i am big ban of marvel movies for me its great movie don't miss it go and watch",9,2,6,7 May 2012
