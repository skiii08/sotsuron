The Blair Witch Project," Be Afraid...be very afraid? Nope!
","I went to see this with an open mind, and to support a film which has threatened to turn Hollywood on its head (no bad thing). I think I have the sort of imagination which can cope with the 'suspension of disbelief' required to enjoy most fiction/horror.But sorry folks. It just *is not frightening*. Nope. No siree. Not even the finale rescues it. Sure, the potential for tension and fear are there, but the best ingredients are not played up enough, not allowed to development. And though there are brilliant (and totally convincing) scenes of the group's developing hysteria  (the actors, especially the girl, give creditable performances), the whole is somehow soul-less.I'm fascinated by the supernatural, and have seen films which leave me feeling pretty vulnerable and uneasy. But not this one.  The required suspension of disbelief isn't enough to make you feel sympathy for the group (maybe it's the fact that they're so ill-prepared for what happens? I don't know).Full marks to the marketing men; this might have been a good 20 minute short. But if it does force a re-evaluation in Tinsel Town then maybe it will have done some good (apart from to the pockets of the producers...).If anyone out there really fainted with fright whilst watching this movie I recommend they find a boy scout to help them next time they try to cross a busy main road. Now that *is* scary!",Null,0,0,17 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nice graphics...shame about the movie
","What a waste! Take some of the best actors around - Neeson, McGregor, Jackson, and the excellent McDiarmid - and virtually ignore the fact that they can act. In this instance, who takes the blame when the performances are wooden? In the old days only the backdrops were supposed to be wooden; but in this film they are the best thing. The stunning scenes during the pod-race; the computer generated climax battle (fought between some odd sounding '70s retro types wearing flares and a huge army of undernourished 'droids). The finale is reminiscent of Part VI, with the three-way split between Jedi duel, land battle and space fight. Yet it still lacked the urgency of Return's climax.The graphics are undeniably superb. But please, give us some credit for enjoying a good storyline too! Only in one or two scenes is the breathless pace and excitement of the original trilogy attained, and the bits in between just drag. As a 'scene-setter' for Episodes II & III it's fine...but did it really need an entire movie to do this? The revamped, re-released IV, V & VI were far better, still showing how far ahead of their time they were. Part of that has to do with the way sympathy is built for the characters -  we really care about these guys! In Episode I it was difficult to get above polite indifference for the fate of the principal players (consider Neeson's demise in comparison to Alec Guinness in the first film...).I really wanted to like this film, despite all the luke-warm press (perhaps because of it). But it just doesn't have a soul...Please Mr Lucas: we love you really -  you've done some great things. Just don't serve up any more glorified computer games or extended 'you've-seen-the-movie-now-buy-the-toys' adverts and call them films...Your company makes brilliant computer games; but this movie was a bit like sitting through someone else's game for two hours... ...oh, and how about this for a plotline for Episode II: have Jar Jar Binks die a glorious (and preferably messy) death for the Republic in the  first scene...that way we won't have to put up with the most annoying computer graphic ever programmed in the history of sci-fi...!",5,0,1,13 August 1999
