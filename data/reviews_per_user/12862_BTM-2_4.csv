The Blair Witch Project," An incredible,original horror film
","Never has there been such an original piece of work as The Blair Witch Project. The creators really put forth much time and effort to create an atmosphere that seems believable,what with the newscasts,interviews,photographic evidence,and the Blair Witch website. Finally the film itself is a masterful achievement. Kudos must go to the trio of Heather,Joshua,and Michael. They performed incredibly well,apparently ad-libbing their way throughout the entire picture. The ending scene was just creepy. An excellent horror film that should not be missed.     Three out of four stars",10,1,2,19 October 1999
Independence Day," Despite its flaws,it's still not a bad film
","Incredible special effects really highlight this box-office smash of an alien race's invasion of Earth,by wiping out its cities,and ultimately the human populace. Cheesy dialogue and a weak plot,however,are quite evident here,but that should not sway one from seeing this film. It can be quite fun at times;I found myself cheering for Will Smith's Captain Hiller during the first combat scene,and President Whitmore's leading the human forces in a battle over Area 51. Also boosted by a dramatic,patriotic score by David Arnold.

Liar Liar," One of Carrey's finest
","This film is one of Jim Carrey's finest.  It made me laugh long and hard. I found it to be better than 'Dumb and Dumber' and the 'Ace Ventura' films, which mostly consisted of juvenile bathroom humor. Carrey certainly delivers in this classic comedy. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,8 March 1999
The Truman Show," Simply incredible...an original masterpiece
","This movie proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Jim Carrey can be taken seriously as a dramatic actor. I was very disappointed that he was snubbed by the Academy Awards for this performance. Ed Harris also performed extremely well,for his portrayal of 'Truman Show' creator Christof. What is so captivating is that this movie is so original,and so well conceived. Peter Weir is magical with his direction. An American masterpiece,The Truman Show should not be missed by anybody. It's funny,touching,and simply incredible.    **** out of ****",10,0,0,29 March 2000
