Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars is meant to be enjoyed, not analyzed.
","One comment I saw on this movie said that the characters were not original.  I then wondered if they had ever even seen the first three films. All the characters in IV-VI are classic Jungian archetypes.  That is what makes SW so wonderful; we can all identify with the characters and apply them to any story.  I also would like to say to anyone that is rejecting The Phantom Menace that they should open their souls and realize that these movies were made to be enjoyed, not to be debated.  George Lucas makes Star Wars movies for money, true, but you will never convince me that he doesn't know how much joy his creations have given the world.  So, go ahead and analyze Star Wars until you are blue in the face.  If you don't like it, then don't go and see it again.  Let the people who know how to have fun sit back and see their dreams played out in the world of George Lucas.",10,0,0,13 June 1999
