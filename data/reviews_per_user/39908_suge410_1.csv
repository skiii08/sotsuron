Scarface," Good
","Unlike many other people who have registered comments, I don't think that the screenplay, in terms of dialogue were necessarily great in Scarface. However, I agree the film is good. That lies mostly in the hands of Pacino's intense performance and the good supporting cast and score. The story reminds me a lot of that of a Roman emperor a.k.a. Caligula. Montana (Pacino) murders his way to the top by taking out the current king Lopez (similar to the way Caligula killed Tiberius), married a beautiful but deeply troubled starlet (Phieffer) while harboring an intense affection for his sister Gina (again like Caligula) and living like a god on earth. Of course, he is eventually taken down by rival forces taking advantage of his greed. The reason the movie is good is because of the pure intensity and realism of it all. DePalma pulls no punches in showing all the glory and grittyness that the american dream can inspire. A good movie more because it is not easily forgotten than because of the content.One note however, it has not aged well. The music is pure 80s dance floor crap and electronica cheeze.",Null,0,0,27 November 2001
