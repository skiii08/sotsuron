The Lobster," Ignore the awards the movie won, it was the most horrid thing I've ever seen.
","If I could give this movie less than a 1, then I would. A boring film that's incredibly hard to sit through, as it tries to be artsy to portray a lousy plot. Poor filming, editing, plot, and the efforts at humor were lost. I listened to the lady next to me say, 'when will this end?' And then it abruptly ended, after 2 hours of agony. I don't recommend this movie to anyone and it is beyond me as to how it won any awards. I went to see it with my brother and father and as we got out of the movie all we could do was laugh at the atrocity we just watched together. The one plus is that there is now no gray area regarding the worst movie I have ever seen; quite simply, it is 'The Lobster.' Collin Farrell is lucky that his career is established, and he is a draw, but his name will never sucker me into another movie. (Think Eddie Murphy in 'Tank,' or virtually any of the recent Adam Sandler movies.) I had to research online what message the director was even trying to get across, as it was lost in this mess of a movie. Two thumbs down. I wish I could've given it a 0 out of 10.",1,45,75,5 June 2016
