First Man," How Much 'Poetic License' Before Fact Becomes Fiction?
","Enough has been written about the choices of photography, acting, etc. I won't repeat all that. My low rating comes from the fact that significant parts of the movie script NEVER happened - think twirling, bracelet on the moon, incidents with wife/kids, etc.
So what is this movie about if it's not historically accurate info about Neil Armstrong? It's fiction (or 'fact-ion'), being sold by implying it's about a famous name and event. Personally I don't like to get suckered into watching an emotional roller coaster that never happened by being told its about Armstrong. That's a cheesy trick at best.
Would this movie have done well without the Neil Armstrong name? I doubt it.",2,5,7,10 February 2019
