Ford v Ferrari," Rev Your Engines Up
","Ford V Ferrari is an excellent biopic movie into the lives of Ken miles and Carroll Shelby. The film is able to beautifully weave their tales without showing anything unnecessary to us and making us truly care for their characters and their race to beat Ferrari. Both Chrisitian Bale & Matt Damon give excellent performances that bring their characters to life. The racing scenes as well are understandably very good giving alot of tension and action to the movie. This is truly a movie to watch and trust me on this, even if you are not a big car fan (like me), you will still enjoy this. I guarantee it.",9,2,2,11 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar Jar is the Dark Side of this Movie.
","Jar jar binks is the main reason why the score is so low. He makes this movie almost insufferable. But beside that the movie is actually decent, with interesting characters and alright story which is a bit plagued by the prequel curse since we know for the most part what will happen. However It is a decent watch for star wars fans and perhaps while as not as good as the previous films, it is a good stepping stone (minus jar jar) towards the prequel trilogy.",5,0,2,17 December 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Disney's best entry in Star Wars.
","A film you wont regret watching as everything from its actors to its story and cinematography does justice to the star wars name. It seeks to tell tell a story which, while you do know the ending of, you will have a delightful time with in its journey as you travel all across the post episode 3 universe. Out of all of the films disney has made, this is probably the most original and the best of out the bunch and something you will not regret seeing.",7,3,4,17 December 2019
Knives Out," A Mystery Donut
","Knives out from the beginning acts as a classic murder mystery full of eccentric characters all in the modern setting. From the very start the movie is able to captivate you, being one of the few movies of 2019 that truly fully captured my attention, as you wait to see how the mystery unfolds all leading to a shocking twist which by itself is enough to the see the movie for. And the characters are all bought to life with each actor/actress able to fully bring out all the specific characteristics of each person that makes them so fun to watch at. This is truly one of the better movies of 2019 and something that everyone should watch (even if murder mysteries aren't your particular brand of donut).",9,0,3,16 February 2020
Zodiac," Slightly Too Long
","Zodiac follows the real life killings for which it is named after. The film did a good job of condensing the true crime story into a 3 hour movie as it seeks to answer who the Zodiac actually was, with the leads all giving good performances to back it up especially Jake who portrays his character quite well. However, due to its long runtime, this is a movie that you should only watch if you are interested in the Zodiac Killings as it doesn't really go beyond the case and doesn't do much other than tell the story. If you are interested however in true crime movies, and especially if you are interested by the Zodiac, then you should watch this. If you're not, then this movie might not be for you.",7,1,1,13 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A Satisfying Conclusion.
","Episode VI, leaves everyone who sees it satisfied, at how the trilogy ended. While perhaps not as good as episode V, the movie does a excellent job at finishing the stories of its central characters and portraying Darth Vader in a more complicated way. This is an good movie and more importantly a superb ending.",8,1,1,31 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A dramatic step up
","Getting rid of jar jar binks is probably the reason why this score is higher than that of episode 1. But aside from that, the story is a bit of the same quality (not inherently bad) as of the previous entry, and also suffers from the prequel curse once again. But the action is stepped up a notch with noticable improvements in the acting department as well. The only main problem is that of anakin and padme's relationship which is downright cringey and hard to watch. However in the end still a good watch and a dramatic improvement from episode 1",6,0,0,17 December 2019
Man of Steel," A New Era, A New Superman
","There is a reason why superman has persisted as one of the most recognizable superheroes of all time and that is, because the character changes as society does as well. Man of steel perfectly encapsulates that thought. While not as cheery as the Christopher Reeves films, Man of Steel is still a joy to sit through and as someone who has watched this movie multiple times, I still enjoy sitting through this movie with each viewing. The action is top-notch, each of the main characters (with the exception Pa Kent) is very well written and well acted, and apart from the ending arc which is a bit too much, it is fantastic in every other category. You need to watch this movie because in my opinion it is one of the better superhero movie out there and something everyone should give a chance to. This is after all, Superman we are talking about.",8,1,1,26 December 2019
Toy Story 4," To infinity and beyond
","Personally i loved the movie, it was a fitting end to a group of movies that i grew up watching and the final moments in the film did give me a little tear. This is a must see for toy story fans.",7,1,5,11 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Quentin strikes again
","This is definely more of a story driven story that explores the reality of the golden age of hollywood. You wont really see any action or anything of the sort, instead you will see a lot of people just talking to each other with the occasional narrator chipping in as well. If you ever watched a Quentin Tarantino and liked it, you will not be disappointed by this.",8,2,5,11 October 2019
The Lion King," Theres a better alternative
","Considering that there is a much better movie out there that will entertain you far better, this movie is not really worth your time. Granted there is some things the movie gets right like the hyenas but in general, if you want to watch the lion king, watch the animated movie.",5,1,2,11 October 2019
1917," A Unique Experience
","1917 gives viewers, even those who watch war movie films on the regular, a different perspective. The one shot film does a beautiful take on war and its effect on those around them as we dont follow a legion of soldiers but 2 only and how their mission effects them. The only real bother for me would be the starting point, it's a bit boring but it does pick up pace after 20 minutes or so. If you like war movie, you should give this one a try.",8,7,11,4 February 2020
The Dark Knight," Believe The Hype
","I'm sure everyone reading this has either already watched The Dark Knight or at least heard about it so instead of babbling on about what I think about the movie, I will say this: believe the hype. This movie even 12 years after its release, still holds up. That alone says something. You will honestly be doing a disservice to yourself by not watching this, and with The Joker (2019) bringing home 2 Oscars, there is no better time than now to re-watch this gem of a movie.",10,0,3,11 February 2020
Midsommar," Crawls under your skin
","Midsommar does what hereditary excelled at, crawling under your skin. Throughout the 2 hours you have with the film, the movie shows more and more disturbing parts which admittedly not scaring you that much, makes you very uneasy. While the plot and characters may be straightforward, the terrific and disturbing music adds a certain kind of ambience to the film that by the end of it, will certainly make you have nightmares. This is a perfect horror movie to watch in the dark but be warned, by the end of it you will want to crawl under the blanket with the lights on.",7,1,2,20 October 2019
Joker," Joker would be proud
","You should not listen to what anyone says, this movie is a mastepiece. Even now 5 hours after i watched the movie, i still get chills from all the moments in the film. The film does an excellent job at potraying arthurs life and his demise leading him to become the joker. This is not really a comic book movie, it is more a crime movie with certain elements of the batman lore that ties in (good) unexpected ways into the film. Now yes, this does have violence and some disturbing scenes but it is a R-rated film about the joker, if it did not, then the movie would be failure. Everyone reading this should watch the joker and you will even hours after seeing it, feel a shiver down your spine, I guarantee it.",10,1,1,11 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A tad too long
","It was a decent movie, not as good as the first but it will generally entertain you, the only main problem with the movie is its huge runtime. They could have easily shaved off 20% of it and it would not have made a huge difference",6,1,2,11 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This is star wars
","The best episode in the prequel series by far in which it seems that George has taken all the criticism levied against the previous films and rectified them in this entry. From the action to the music to even the story, the film improves on every aspect of the previous entries and quite wonderfully concludes the trilogy which fits in smoothly into the original films. This is what star wars is about.",7,0,0,17 December 2019
Parasite," The Best Film Of 2019
","This is not only the best film of 2019 but one of the best in the decades. The film does a wonderful job at crafting the story of the Kim family and their journey with the Parks. The film makes subtle nodes to the class differences between them which doesn't come across as preachy or in your face, which all adds up to a stunning ending. But outside of the class differences, the movie acts a good comedy as well in which you will be smiling at all the various antics of the Kim family does in order to fulfil their plan. Even though this might be a foreign film for non-Korean audiences and you have to read subtitles, you have to look past that because once you do, you wont regret watching this marvel of a film.",10,21,33,15 January 2020
Marriage Story," Some Of The Best Acting I've Ever Seen
","This movie is unequivocally carried by its stellar acting performance from its leads. Throughout the movie, you will feel the emotions of the actors and actresses on the screen and what they are going through. And the story itself does a good job at trying not to paint a black and white picture of a divorce instead making it a grey affair where both the man and the woman are in some part in fault. This is one of 2019s best acting and you need to see it just for that.",8,5,8,31 December 2019
The Sixth Sense," Stood the test of time
","The sixth sense even in 2019 proves to be an absolute treat. The movie at its heart is a film that seeks to explore death and how that death affects those around us through the use of Cole. And while I was sceptical as child actors can vary substantially, I am happy to report the actor does a excellent job. In fact every one of the actors does a good job at portraying their characters. The story itself is quite good and the main twist is a welcomed surprise although a bit easy to guess once you're about 60% through the film. The only main problem is its opening which is quite slow and a bit hard to sit through. However other than that, this movie is something every film goer should watch, it has after all in my eyes stood the test of time.",7,1,1,31 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Classic Fun
",There is a reason why people even over 40 years later still talks about this movie and that is because it is so good. This movie would spawn the largest film franchise in history and one of the most culturally significant pieces in modern history and after watching the movie it is no reason why. This show from its atmosphere to the story to the acting is superbly made and everyone who has some sort of appreciation should watch this marvel of a film. Watch it.,8,1,1,24 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best Star Wars Has To Offer
","This is by no other word, the best star wars movie ever. The movie does a excellent job at expanding the star wars universe while also developing its central characters and their relationships to a fine degree. Everything the first movie did, this movie does that and so much more. But the icing on top is Darth Vader and you will learn why he is regarded as one of the best cinematic villains in history from watching this. You are truly missing out by not watching this.",8,0,0,24 December 2019
