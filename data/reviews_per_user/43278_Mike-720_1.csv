Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This one's different from the others, THAT'S WHY I LOVE IT!!!!!
","I just saw this movie. It was way different from the other SW films. Why? It has good humor, Jar Jar is such a funny character! That's why it's different, the other SW movie are NOT funny! It's just action. Okay, Maybe that's not a lot of reasons why it's different, but it's cool! Go watch it! It's cool!",Null,0,0,3 June 1999
