The New World," Incoherent Art
","While I applaud the historical authenticity of the film - the situations, sets, costumes, language & cultural characterizations were excellent - I found it to be an incoherent mess which started out chaotically and by mid-film, had become very slow, completely boring & pointless.After a brief promising start (and excellent work by Christopher Plummer), the film starts jumping all over the place with no sense of time or space. If this was an attempt at conveying the chaos & uncertainty of a strange situation in a strange land, it succeeded, but it was, in my opinion, lousy storytelling. Looked like the editor was on PCP. Or something.While it was interesting to hear the native dialog in the proper tongue, after Smith learns the language and could presumably understand them, it would have been nice if we've been treated the same. Subtitling, while appropriately absent at first, should have been used more often later. Often, it was just too difficult to tell what was going on. And it's not very interesting to hear long exchanges of dialog when the actions give you no clue as to what's happening.Colin Farrell was wasted. He spent 90% of the film with one expression on his face - looking very worried. One gets the impression that director Terrence Malick said, 'look very worried, Colin', and left it at that. In the first 30 minutes of the film, he had perhaps 8 lines of dialog. In fact, in the rest of the film, he didn't say much more.Q'Orianka Kilcher was a joy to behold, and conveyed innocence, vulnerability & childish playfulness beautifully, but how many times can you watch her gesticulating at the sun & walking through fields? Malick apparently couldn't get enough of it.The portrayal of the military actions was laughable. As a 17th century historical re-enactor, I was cheered when I saw them form up with pike & musket (if somewhat shambolically) to face the 'naturals' outside the fort. But after presenting a wall of pikes, and sending one line of musketeers forwards to fire (with none in reserve for the second volley - which is basic stuff in this era), instead of getting the musketeers to retire & reload whilst the pikes covered the front, for some reason everyone suddenly ran forward in all directions, and got done over as they deserved to do for being so stupid. For Pete's sake! If you're going to run all over the place, it defeats the purpose of having a formation in the first place. Duh.I guess I'm not a fan of Malick's films. I thought The Thin Red Line one of the worst war (or war-setting) films I have ever seen. In that one, we had similar military nonsense - the Japanese, deadly crack shots who never miss at a distance of 2 miles, apparently cannot hit a single one of dozens of Americans running at them from 30 yards away. Maybe they weren't trained that way. When there was no shooting, everyone just whined.But back to The New World. It may be art (it's obviously intended to be, since it's not entertainment), and it's certainly a film, but it doesn't do a good job of telling a story.",2,2,5,5 August 2006
Sucker Punch," It Doesn't make Sense
","The film is just an excuse for a lot of nonsensical eye candy.And it reinforces the Hollywood stereotype of abusive stepfathers,and 1950s/60s mental institutions (just to overdo the point, this one is for the 'Mentally Insane') as unbelievably filthy, abusive prisons run by corrupt sadists.Even if you can stomach that, since most of the film is Baby Doll's escapist fantasy, she must be either a prescient genius or remarkably well-informed, or both, since she knows all about Japanese demons, World War One hardware, LOTR type fantasy scenarios, mobile chain guns and other weapons and hardware not invented in her time (21st century style headsets for example) and various bits of fantasy hardware including steampunk zombies and Japanese type power armor not envisaged until a over decade later with the iconography of a decade after that. Not to mention Anime combat, 21st century style. Some girl!Even passing over all that as a metaphor for... something... what did it mean?Wookies living on Endor.... If it doesn't make sense, you must acquit!",Null,3,8,10 April 2011
Hidden Figures," Unreal Fairy Tale Riddled with Errors and Lies
","It's a 2 hour film, but it took me over 4 hours to watch it because I kept having to take sanity breaks.
I was overwhelmed by a virtual avalanche of inaccuracies (factual, historical, scientific), distortions and 'Hollywood moments' which all rang so false in the face of historical knowledge, and in many cases, common sense, that I would have to periodically walk away and calm down. And do some research to check some details - love the Internet.Yes, I know the film is not a documentary, I know that there is such a thing as dramatic licence and artistic licence and so forth, but this was not, as advertised, a 'dramatic biopic'; it was fairytale. The impact was doubled by the hideous dumbing-down of everything. Everything was a caricature. There are no real, 3-D people in this film. There are only goodies and baddies. The goodies are always right, and the baddies are always wrong. In fact, some of the goodies have magical powers and do things that are ridiculous and impossible - sort of the cerebral equivalent of action heroes in a Chuck Norris film, I suppose. There are 2 speaking part baddies who get redemption at the end of the film by seeing the error of their ways and finally behaving nicely. Ta-dah! Redemption level achieved. Lesson learned. Example set. Didn't see that coming, did you?The central theme is that both black people ('coloreds') and women were treated unequally at the time in the US, and the film lays this on with a trowel. And then a shovel. And then a series of dump trucks. OK, the film-maker is entitled to emphasis his point, and these things were true in many aspects of everyday life, and this would be a fair enough take, except for one important thing. The average viewer would come away thinking that racial segregation was endemic at NASA, which is actually the opposite of the truth. NASA was a federally-mandated equal opportunity employer (one of the first), and in fact, set up by Johnson that way to provide opportunities for education, employment and advancement for blacks. There were no segregated workplaces at NASA. Yes, there had been, years before, at NACA, but by 1961, they were long gone. Yes, there was one 'Colored Women's Bathroom' (left over from the old NACA days) at Langley, but it wasn't 1/2 a mile away, and the sign wasn't dramatically knocked down with a tyre iron in front of a breathless audience by the head of NASA (or Kevin Costner). As usual, the truth was more prosaic. Its existence was mostly ignored, and the sign was eventually removed with a memo. Apparently this tyre iron scene in the film had US audiences cheering. Cheering. Did they think it was real? Or even remotely likely? The logic wouldn't fool a 12 year old.While this film provides, apparently, many uplifting moments, I found it so contrived and false and wrong (unintentionally in many places) that I was alternating between outraged gasps and laughing out loud. I know that this is a common experience for those of us with an interest in history, but there is one difference here: many of the the people who worked there at the time are still around, and they must love that they're all being painted as misogynistic racists.
Most people don't read books or even articles. The film is what they will think was the truth. That's sad.
I could list all the distortions, exaggerations, and stupid scientific/factual errors in this film, but that will have to wait until I have a few hours spare. In the meantime, look under the Goofs section, and you will see over 100 of them.
The Director really let go of the rope on this one.The story of these women is a good one. It's just a shame it was told in such a ham-fisted, patronizing (to the audience) and careless way.",3,23,44,14 January 2018
