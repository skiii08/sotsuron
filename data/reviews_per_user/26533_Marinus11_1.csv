Lucky Number Slevin," Absolutely worth being called a gangster movie
","I found Lucky Number Slevin more fun watching when I WAS DONE watching. Do you understand? Well, I have a hard time understanding too. During the movie, it is hard finding out what the motives are of Slevin and what his purpose is in the whole film. During that quest, you get rewarded by the outstanding performances of Willis, Freeman and Kingsley. They are absolutely superb and really enjoyable to watch. Their henchmen look a bit like the crooks from the famous Snatch movies, although with less character and not the same amount of humor. I didn't expect actress Lucy Liu to be so good in this type of movie. Perhaps I still imagine her as an 'Angel', but she really contributed to this movie. When I was watching the movie, I'd rate it a seven. But at the end, when the purpose and main motive of the main character became clear, I was shocked! Positively, of course. When I was done watching, I immediately knew the movies was worth a big fat eight.",8,1,2,17 April 2014
