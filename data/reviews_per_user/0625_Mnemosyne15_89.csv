At the same time, the martyr who acted for the heavens could not escape the original emotion of jealousy. When the mystery was finally revealed, the out-of-control behavior of the young police officer was a divergence from the exception to the general one.

","This movie brings you not only a story, but also a standard textbook. The film systematically uses 'depth-of-field lens', long-length paragraphs, sports photography, audio montage, background processing with ceilings, etc. These bold attempts of visual skills are precisely to put this elusive, trapped surrounding Kane The alienated world art is presented. It has become the supreme coordinate to measure the artistic achievements of cinema. The film uses a special lens with deep focus to make the background and foreground as clear as possible.

The Godfather: Part II," So this movie is the Bible for men, right?
","If the first is a landmark gangster epic, then the second is undoubtedly more refined and beautiful than the first. The connection between the two main lines in time and space tells the different struggle history of the two generations of the godfather. They are two extremes. Vito Corleone became the godfather because of the family, so the family relationship is more harmonious. Mike Corleone became the godfather for his career. A mild and indifferent extreme difference also makes their lives completely different, and this difference is also reflected in their different worldviews. If you have more career, you will have less family. It is still the same formula, but it makes people feel the delicate emotions and the difficult growth of a man. Maybe this movie is more suitable for young people to watch, and more suitable for the people who are going through it.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Love and justice are eternal topics
","In fact, we don't need to imagine the scene set in the movie, it has to be some kind of unique ring in the world. Think about the fact that in your life, you often have various desires: beautiful clothes, wealth, houses, or just a simple meal. If there are some obstacles in the desire for these things, some people intentionally or unintentionally create Some troubles, while hindering and delaying the realization of desire, will also become disappointed, angry, and even hateful. Why is this so? It's easy to think that we are not good enough, and we need external things to add color and change. If this wish is not realized, we blame the external reasons. I think this is because there is a scar inside, a sadness and fear that impressed me that I am not good enough to be loved, and this scar is so painful that I ca n't face it, so I choose to escape and grab it desperately Foreign objects make you feel good. Therefore, it is pitiful and sad to think of this state carefully. People's attention is directed to the outside world, how precious is a treasure like a Lord of the Rings, and how happy it is to have it, but the opposite is true. Seeing the grunt who became nervous because of the Lord of the Rings in the movie, the rebellious king who died because of the Lord of the Rings finally died, and if the human heart is outward, he will suffer or lose. Treat all possible threats as enemies to be destroyed, and live like this Full of fear, suspicion, worry, and even hatred, what happiness is there?We need to look inward and work hard with people. I think there is only one thing that touches me deeply in the movie-that is love. Whether it is for a promise of brotherly love, for the love of men and women who have given up eternal life for love, or for the love of beings, but for the sentimental love of a gentleman, these are the most touching and ultimately successful The only power. Such a life can be regarded as death without regrets, because when he was alive, he was loyal to his true desire in the heart, and bravely put it into practice, even though he has endured trials and hardships, but he has practiced a true heart, and this true heart can stand.

","Although the story is still the story of the old-fashioned superhero as a whole, the picture really gave me a very big surprise, the plot and dialogue are very interesting, the scene is particularly comical, giving a strong visual conflict, It was too exciting to watch, and various spiders appeared at the end. The style of painting is like a comic strip moving directly. There are a lot of imaginative and expressive shots that cannot be achieved by live-action movies. This is the advantage of animation. Even if it draws something that real people cannot do, you will believe it. And still feel cool because it's the charm of animation that is different from live-action movies",9,0,0,21 March 2020

Even if the onlookers saw their true colors, they would not admit it, even step by step towards the abyss of sin. And most of us are the same. I dare not say that I am not short of money at all. I dare not say that I have absolute sovereignty. While full of life and light, I will appreciate my 'heart' in the dark without anyone watching.

There are many more rules in life that need to be paid attention to all the time, and breaking the rules requires great courage and even pays some price.
Since we ourselves do not have the courage and ability to break through these circles, we try to let the 'catfish' enter our circles and try to do different things ourselves.

It requires a certain amount of patience and memory when watching, otherwise it will definitely be confused, but when you see the ending, you will find that it is not obtrusive because there are too many details and dialogues in the front. It was foreshadowed, but not in the end, I really couldn't connect everything together. Someone can't hide his unease with strangers, is that the way angels talk?

In an awkward situation. Peter the wise man was to avoid the original separation of the two lines of Aragon and Frodo, and let the lines intersect with each other, which was extremely spectacular. Make the computer special effects and the natural landscape seamless connection, character modeling: Guru has reached a height never seen in the computer characters in live-action movies, and the white robe Gandalf's upgraded modeling has a more 'god' plucking. The finale of the Battle of the Holy Helm Valley lived up to expectations, and its stand was enough to pay for movie tickets.

Pulp Fiction," Everyone is the protagonist of their own lives, and also the supporting role of others' lives. You will never know what happens in the next moment.
","The film uses five separate segments to show us the story in a non-narrative manner from multiple angles. At first glance, the five segments seem to have no connection. This is not the case.Each story is closely linked to each story. And each story has the protagonist of each story. In other people's stories, you can only be a trivial passer-by by chance. In your world, you are your own protagonist, but you cannot do whatever you want, because you cannot leave the big world. In the big world, everyone is a small role, and no one is the real protagonist.At the beginning of the film, the couple intends to rob the restaurant as if everything is under their control.At the end of the film, he returned to the restaurant, but at this time the protagonist has become Jules, and the little couple has become a stepping stone for the self-redemption of the gang member Jules.For another example, when the killer Vinson was with Martha's wife Mia, they danced and twisted to get the trophy, as if the world were revolving around them.But in a blink of an eye, the gold medal killer Vinson was shot by the most familiar gun in Boxer's Butch chapter.The film uses the restaurant story as the beginning and the end, not only because the restaurant fragment is at the center of all the fragments, but also because Jules and Vinson have different views on not being shot at close range, which ultimately leads to their fate. Different.In the restaurant, Jules thought that this miracle was God's guide to him, and he decided to wash his hands in a golden basin. Vinson only thought it was a weird coincidence. When Vinson went to the toilet, a little couple in the restaurant robbed the restaurant with a gun, but they met a killer who often killed someone with a gun. The little couple was quickly controlled by Jules. But Jules did not kill them. He had decided to rehabilitate, so he let the little couple away and even gave them his money.After the timeline after the luggage was delivered, we did not see the group Jules again. When delivering the luggage, the arrogant Vinson annoyed the boxer Butch. Butch missed the fake punch and was chased by the gangster. To kill, Vincent was sent to monitor Butch's home, but he was shot dead when Butch returned home to collect his gold watch.Although they are all killers, one likes the Bible, one loves vulgar novels, one believes in the miracles of God, one thinks weird coincidence, one is humble, one is arrogant, and two attitudes determine two destinies. In the end one wandered around to help others, and one died of arrogance in the grab of someone else and went to extinction.The accidental factor, the attitude to life, and the living environment determine the inevitable fate of a person.

The same thing, different people will certainly have different results, some people just can do a trivial little thing different from everyone. At the end of the film, George's consciousness finally brightened, and everyone helped him through his crisis. At that time, he finally realized how wonderful the place he had been living in.
In fact, people always like to show their best side in front of everyone, how much sadness behind the seemingly enviable looks on the screen is not everyone can experience.

Acting as the soul of the film, Mike Murphy, played by male lead Jack Nicholson, contributes to the plot and height of the film. He showed off a cynical and clever pseudo-psychiatric patient.

Effort is the foundation of progress. Even genius cannot escape the fate of hard work. As ordinary people, what reason do we have for ourselves to fall. I very much agree with this statement. A genius can be a genius because he can think of things that everyone cannot think of, and he can do things that everyone cannot. Then he became a genius. If he didn't work hard before that, how could he think of it. In this way we grow, thorns and bumps everywhere. Maybe something that is important to you is very important to others. It's like you think you are very interesting and you are eager to find an interesting soul. But actually I think everyone is interesting, just find an interesting person that matches your own taste.

Inception," Dream and reality
","Dreamland is something that has not been thoroughly researched so far, because it exists in our minds. It is too difficult and dangerous to thoroughly understand the dreamland. The director Christopher Nolan fulfilled all our imaginations of dreams through this film. Is it a dream in reality or a reality in dreams.
After watching the movie, I was surprised at the imagination of Christopher Nolan. 6 layers of dreams. Through subconscious dreaming, one layer is more dangerous than the other, and the time of each layer is superimposed on the time of the previous layer. Through the implantation of the subconscious, the dreamed subject has an idea that does not belong to him. In the deepest part of the dream, Limbo is a country that will make people lost. Dreams can go against all common sense, or beauty, or danger, and leave us infinite reveries.
Even though Mal in the movie knew it was a dream at first, he still fell into it, lost his child, lost his life, and lost his faith. It became a nightmare and appeared in Cobb's dream. It was this nightmare that brought deadly danger to their mission.
The most powerful thing about this movie is the alternation of reality and dream. When you dive deeper, you can't tell whether the surroundings are true or not. In the face of beautiful things, you don't feel trapped and you don't want to wake up. But we must remember that no matter how beautiful the dream is, it is not a reality after all.
In our lives, we are all looking forward to a world like dreams, everything goes well, and everything goes well, but these are non-existent. I have not tasted a sweet and bitter life and cannot call it a life. The film uses imagination to solve a difficult problem for us. The key to distinguishing between reality and dreams is not actually a gyro, but a desire for the dreams you want to achieve.",8,1,2,12 March 2020

The Shawshank Redemption," Tribute to freedom
","This film has always been regarded as a treasure by filmmakers in various countries and regions. If the re-evaluation of classic movies is regarded as an act that can't keep up with the trend, then I'm sorry, I'm late.
To be honest, I used to scoff at these classic movies. I think that's just because they fit the appetite of the film festival judges, so they are popular with ordinary people.
But on a boring night, I couldn't sleep, and opened it with a try mentality. In the following more than 100 minutes, I was deeply attracted by it.Red said hope is dangerous and the source of mental distress. He had been in the jail for thirty years, and he was indeed qualified to say so.Because from the day he came in, the warden said, 'Give your soul to God and your body to me.' Except for the cigarettes and poker cards with naked girls that he can get, any other changes in this dark Nothing seems to grow inside the high walls.But Andy told him, 'Remember, hope is a good thing-maybe even the best of the world. And good things never disappear.'So Andy was able to use two decades to dig a tunnel that Rhett thought could not be drilled for six hundred years. When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of foul-stained sewage pipe, standing in the pouring rain, he couldn't help but feel as if we saw faith pierce the dark curtain and hit a thunderbolt in the dark night. In the light, our cowardly souls appeared and shuddered under Andy's open arms.",10,1,1,12 March 2020

","It's a pity that Parasite is attacking inequality with the poor's wrong face and choice. This is probably the reason why I have not been able to truly accept this film, because it is really uncomfortable to think deeper. The structure and technique of the film are shocking, but the idea behind it is really difficult to understand. If you want to say what it makes people think about, it should be the most basic respect between people. No matter what class, status, or situation, you can really treat the other person as a person, not those inferior ones.",7,0,1,15 March 2020

Many of the problems reflected in the film are the epitome of contemporary society. Everyone can almost find his own shadow, be discriminated against and not understood, guilty of guilt and even sin. These unknown dark sides can be Find resonance in The Silent Lamb.Therefore, compared with other horror thrillers, this film is a classic in the classics.

The Matrix," we choose because we have no choice.
","If you think about it, we in the real world cannot know whether the world is real or whether we exist. Maybe our real world is also a matrix. The 'Creator' created it and gave it limited natural laws to allow it to develop freely. Human scientists can discover the laws of nature, but can never explain why it is this way, not that way.
Why is the Planck constant the current value and the speed of light is exactly 300,000 kilometers per second? Perhaps such a question will never be answered, it depends on the preferences of the Creator. Those who belong to this world cannot surpass the rules of this world. Only those who do not belong to this world and have the same level as the Creator may be unrestricted and arbitrarily modified. The right of human free choice is inevitably limited, because if everyone's existence is in the rules, the law of causality is inevitable. But it is ironic: only choice can define our existence, so we choose because we have no choice.",8,0,0,12 March 2020

","Lucas himself said that 'the plot is very simple, that is, justice defeats evil.' Like his original intent to shoot Star Wars, it was unpretentious. But because of such simplicity, seriousness, and love, even these adjectives are so old-fashioned, and they continue to appear in different success stories. This classic movie has been the source of today's Star Wars pop culture.Let's take a look at the phrase why Lucas wanted Star Wars: 'The main reason why I shoot' Star Wars 'is to tell a healthy, positive legend to young people today, a story I heard as a child 'Now countless children, including grown-ups, have entered the world he constructed, believing that evil is not overwhelming, and have been positively encouraged in the subtle influence.

Goodfellas," About the torture of humanity and morality
","To some extent, the most successful part of the film is its self-confidence in dealing with the rhythm and theme given by its authenticity.Its authenticity extends to the protagonist Henry's intention to join the gang, the desire for material desires, and a primitive and unadorned violent worship. At the same time, the unhappiness of family life gave him a desire to be recognized and recognized. Regarding his enthusiastic pursuit of self-worth recognition, he stuck his face to the window and looked at the people across the street. Since then, the whole film has always been compact, from his stepping into the den across the street to becoming one of them. Then met Tommy and Jimmy, and then went to commit crimes, start a family, commit a major crime, and finally went to jail, pleaded guilty, and assisted the police to confess other associates, and was included in the witness protection plan. From an outsider's perspective, I can't find the climax of the film. Some people say that the climax is Henry's imprisonment, but I think Scorsese will not be too interested in the popular theme of punishing evil and doing good. From the perspective of the dictator, the climax of the film should be the most popular part of the three brothers' illegal business.

At the beginning of the story, he helped many people preside over justice, highlighting his powerful ability and 'selflessness'.Leaving aside the identity of 'rogue', he is almost perfect, humble, trustworthy, calm and calm. This line of 'Sheep in wolf skin' is the truth conveyed by The Godfather:'A man who doesn't take time to stay with his family is not a real man.''Women and children can be careless, but men can't.''Don't let outsiders know what you're thinking.'His playing time is actually not much, but every action and every sentence is the essence. Without him, The Godfather would not become the 'Man's Bible'.How could this great man be 'tragedy'?He is not personally tragedy, at least he is 'good end', which is related to the principle he has always adhered to. In his opinion, career should not be an excuse for delaying the family. If a person loses his family, it means that a boat has lost the only harbor where it can dock and can only drift in the cold and horrible sea alone.In the end, he held his own harbor.Tragically, he failed to keep up with his own era.",10,0,0,12 March 2020
