The King's Speech," like
","I would like to see this movie again. I don't know contents before I see the movie. Main character is a member of royal family. He has a sick and he stammered during his speech. He can't resign about speech, because he is a member of royal family. He has to relax the British public. So he must cure his sick. He meets a man. The man cures his stammer with him. I like their talk. I laughed at their jokes. However finally I was deeply impressed with story. I think that this movie is so perfect and it became one of the my favorite movies. I was able to empathize with that story. I feel about accomplishing his task. However I would like to add the scene living of the British people to story. Besides I want the scene that they begin a war. So I will be move more.",8,0,1,9 October 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," friendship
","This movie is science fiction and was made in 1982. However I can't believe it. First, talking of E.T., that famous scene, was fling to the sky. It is so fantasy. Second, E.T. has strange body and face and voice. I can't image alien such as this. I think that perhaps anyone meet a visitor from space. Eliot takes after E.T. in coward. Cowards yield a lot of humor. I thought that E.T. is only interesting, in the fact, be impressed. It moved me to cry. They trust and like each other. I think that it is happy to have best friends In childhood. Besides they are odd. They have friendship, alien and boy. However the scene that medical team comes E.T. is sudden, I can't understand soon. I would like to have explanation. Overall, this movie is excellent. So I repeated this three times. This movie should leave future generations.",8,0,1,2 October 2013
LÃ©on: The Professional," lover
","I saw the Leon. The story is that a lonely assassin 'Leon' meets a girl 'Mathilda' who lives in next door, and his life changes because of her. I would like to introduce my favorite scene of this movie.The best scene, I think, is that Leon faced to conflict whether he let Mathilda into his room in the head of this movie. This is because I think that this scene is the point that he and she got the human emotion, which is love. I couldn't know why he doesn't get to love anyone, but she was abused by her family except for her little brother, so she couldn't get to love anyone. After meeting each other, their life gets colored by changing from what they were. Besides being a daughter, she was a lover. Besides accepting his order as a daughter, she claimed to behave as a lover. I feel so interested in such changes of heart between him and her, so I chose this scene.",Null,1,1,9 October 2013
Inception," totem
","I was particularly fascinated with world view of this movie. It has dreams world and realities world. This movie stimulated me hard. I don't want to overlook it even for one second. Some people says, 'This movie is too difficult to understand.' I think, if it is easy, probably it is not great movie. My favorite part is 'We don't think dreams, we are in our dreams.' It is true, at once I feel scary that we can't see the boundary between realities and dreams. The last scene divides our opinion. Finally, the director did it deliberately. This has fresh images and sounds. So I wanted to see in a theater. I regretted. It keeps me in suspense. I saw excellent movie. I felt that 150 minutes is too short.",Null,0,1,6 October 2013
The Social Network," Life
","I have been used FACEBOOK for 1 years, so I wanted to see this movie. FACEBOOK was founded by university student. I also university student. However I can not make social network such as this. This movie show not only foundation but also a person's life to us. The number of Users of FACEBOOK exceed one billion. It is remarkable. There is the SNS company where management does not go well. University students can found companies in America. We , university students should follow it. It is not severe in terms of age. If there is even an idea, we can build a company. So I would like to see this movie for many of university students. It may give a motivation and hint of management. University students have a lot of time, so we should use effectively it. It is how effectively you use the available time that counts.",7,0,1,3 October 2013
