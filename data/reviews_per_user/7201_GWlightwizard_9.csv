Vertigo," A Romantic and Psychological Mystery with a Metaphysical Aura
","If anyone has produced a more engrossing mystery than this, Hitchcock's finest effort and his most unique film, please tell me.  No gimmicks here, just an enigmatic tale of love, lust, betrayal, and a mystery that envelopes one with a feeling of being in another world.  So many classic scenes that it is no wonder it consistently shows up on top ten lists.  If anyone isn't swept away by the performances and the intrigue of the plot, they should go so their doctor to see if they are still alive. The one scene that really gives me the feeling that there are metaphysical forces at work here is the one the in redwoods at the center of the film.  Many cite the scene in the small hotel as a pivotal part of the plot, the point where Scotty (Jimmy Stewart) has finally lost himself to his compulsion.  Kim Novak plays her character exactly as Hitchcock intended and she was perfectly cast.  She never came up to this level again in her career.  Telling point: a few years after I saw the film, I returned to Ernie's in San Francisco (the restaurant where the Scotty first see Madeline) and it was positively eerie.",10,3,5,23 May 2001
The Fifth Element," An Entertaining Film as a Satirical Romp
","This film is like some futuristic Candide.  Murphy's Law is at work around every corner, even the villain gets his due by a flub of fate. Besson is having fun with our pretensions and the visual set piece is the concert with the fabulous blue Diva and her Windex colored blood. The action scenes are even a send up of all the action scenes we've ever been exposed to in cinema.  The story is not the important element(sic), it's an excuse for the trappings and the flamboyant visual style of Bresson. Some judicious editing could have tightened up the action but I can rather understand why some reduntive scenes were left in because of the bravura imagery.  If you are receptive to it, you are bowled over by the spectacular visualization of the future and the sly comedy.  If you are not, it is just a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.  But, if you are not into being adultish and are not prejudiced to the genre of space opera, this is a lot of fun to watch.",8,0,1,26 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Fantasy Film for All Seasons
","The film is an extraordinary accomplishment and is not just Peter Jackson's vision but very much on target in the settings, the characters, the costumes, the music, et al. The aesthetics of the film are superb and I'm sure it will win many awards in those categories.  The tailoring of the narrative into a three hour film (it could easily be a four to five hour film!) was wisely done - I was a bit taken aback by the allegiance of Saruman with Sauron as he has designs on the ring for himself in the books (and you were not sure whether to trust him or not).  I don't know if that would have made sense to a general audience being that so many are tempted by its' power. The acting is what would be expected with a cast of this caliber - one would be even more saddened by Boromir's fate in the books as there is more room for character development and although he too is tempted with the ring, he is a very noble and beguiling character. I was astonished that Jackson felt as I do about the poetry in the book - it did not belong in this film in some cases reading rather more sophomorish than even Tolkien would have every liked to admit.Favorite scenes: those around Rivendell with the interaction of the characters, the Great Hall in the Mines of Moria and Gandalf's confrontation with the Balrog (the most spectacular supernatural beast ever in film - the monster in 'Forbidden Planet' was basically patterned after the Balrog). There are many scary and monstrous creatures in the books and the building up of the insurmountable dread is, shall we say, picture perfect and for adults, not small children.I would hope that the DVD would put back more scenes in Rivendell and Galadriel's Lothlorian forest. So I thought it was too short and I saw their consideration to screen the film at least four times a day as 'Titanic' only had three screenings per day. If I criticized anything, it would be that they should have let it run at least 3-1/2 hours, enough time for more character development.   I was never bored one minute with the pacing as it was.For the nay sayers (even if it isn't their cup of tea), I only have one thing to say: SOUR  GRAPES (most film critics are wanna-be filmmakers anyway)!  Anyone who could put together a coherent film from these books with such bravura and great fervor has to be commended.  There is unmistakable style to the film and it has an indelible impact which will encourage many who have not read the books to read them (that's happening already). Here's to those all day LOTR parties when all three films are released on DVD!",10,0,0,3 January 2002
Mulholland Drive," A Nightmarish Enigma
","If you can imagine 'Blue Velvet' gone completely berserk, you'd still not be able to fully describe this picture.  It starts out as a conventional film noir (well, as conventional as Lynch is able to get) and begins exploring some Hitchcockian territory only to begin spinning around and literally losing all of its marbles.  Is this bad?  No, it's gripping, enthralling, provocative and frustrating.  There's some hints about what Lynch is up to in the middle of the film with the drug addict meeting a character who was an bungling assassin earlier in the film.  Is this a drugged out dream of some street waif who hoped the Hollywood dream was a reality for her?  Who knows - it just means you're doomed to want to see this film again and again, and  just as likely will be as dumbfounded and impressed each time. This was made from an aborted TV pilot that was deemed too deep, too quirky and too full of high powered sexual themes for the TV audience. Understatement of the century!  Watch it and be amazed.",9,1,2,1 July 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Succeeds on a cinematic level like no other film.
","Stanley Kubrick knew exactly what he wanted when he made this film. It is a use of cinematic language that requires no real storyline and very little dialogue.  This is the classic 'a picture is worth a thousand words.'  It is almost imperative to have the experience in a theater and I originally saw it at the Hollywood Cinerama Dome.  The first sequence with the primates is deftly handled as the primates do actually seem as human as they are ape (noted that many miss the point that they are not meant to appear to be like modern apes).  The marvelous symbology showing the first use of tools and the brief instant the bone is tossed in the air to become a space vehicle is one of the most stunning in all of cinematic history. There is a conscious effort of the director to communicate the emptiness of space as a metaphor for the emptiness of life.  We don't know where we are going and we really don't care as a race. That brings us into the concept of HAL as the villain of the piece, our technology which is suppose to make everything right suddenly makes everything wrong.  The final sequence? Again, a cinematic voyage into a profound and portentous future that await us all.  This isn't a pretentious or boring subject to me and the way in which Kubrick left us to interpret the meaning of the film is it's prime success.  Read the original book and you still will get more than what Clarke could communicate with the written word from this filmed version.  I can see why there is are prejudices against this film by viewers and critics alike, but I personally don't understand the dissension.",10,0,1,25 May 2001
Where Eagles Dare," Suspense and Action Played to the Hilt
","Anyone who takes this movie seriously has got to have a bad case of adultitis.  This is typical Alistair McClean with all the plot twists and set ups that are completely unbelievable, but if you are not expecting anything more it is one of the most enjoyable of action flicks.  I recently saw it in letterbox on TCM in a good print and with good sound. The Godwin score, very Shostakovitch in tone, is one of the most exhilarating ever composed for a film with it's march tempo theme punctuating each great escape.   The cinematography is rather dark and sullen, but that is part of the atmosphere of the film.  Richard Burton was coming off a downsided career and turns in a typical Burton intense portrayal.  Clint Eastwood is perfect for the stupefied American who isn't quite sure what he got himself into (a bit of sly comedy at the end when he tells Burton he'd prefer to be left out of the next jaunt). Mary Ure was unknown and remained virtually unknown, but puts a nice twist on her characterization as the female accomplice.  All the cast is excellent and the direction by Brian Hutton who also directed 'Kelly's Heroes' is taught and moves forward at a breakneck pace with only a few lulls.  All in all, a ride on a movie roller coaster one can't deny is very well put together.",8,2,3,29 May 2001
From Hell," A Convincing and Chilling Conjecture
","Let me start with the look of this film because that is what lures one into being catapulted into the era when these events took place.  Kubrick with 'Barry Lydon' really inspired filmmakers to use classic painting as a basis for production design and many of the scenes could be framed as fine art. Johnny Depp turns in another very potent character study and this film is very convincing in its premise which isn't just based on the material credited.   There have been many theories that have credence, linking the murders to those portrayed in the film.  No matter whether you want to believe it but the way the film is put together (with some peerless editing), you come to believe that the mystery has been solved.  A gripping and terrifying film, not for the weak hearted.",9,0,1,27 June 2002

Blade Runner," A Provocative and Disturbing Vision of the Future
","When I first viewed this film in a theater I was overwhelmed by the visual mastery.  The opening tracking shot of Los Angeles in the future establishes the mood of the film, but what happens to the main character Deckard is revelatory. In one of Harrison Ford's best portrayals, Deckard is caught up in an intriguing pursuit and a bizarre romance that can only come from the pen of Philip K. Dick.  The author has explored the prospects of artificial humans to the depth that Isaac Azimov has explored the world of robots. There is a philosophical overtone about the transitory nature of life that never becomes maudlin and is essential to the theme and the climax of the story. 
The use of the Bradbury Building, an existing famous building in Los Angeles, with the forbidding edifice of the Tyrell Corporation creates a feeling of the timelessness of a city.  There is enough atmosphere for three films and it permeates the action with purpose.  Is this a warning about the future absorbing of our souls into technology to the point of even making life seem arbitrary?  I comprehend that and only science fiction has been able expose that so well, before in '2001: A Space Odyssey.'  The artistic merits of the film are peerless with an inventive and haunting score by Vangelis and the exploration of cinematic effects that are crucial to the story.  It is one of my favorite films and always will be.  Nothing is handed to you verbatim in this film.  I requires one to think and interpret and that is entertaining in itself.",10,0,0,26 May 2001
