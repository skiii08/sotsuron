Hereditary," scary
","I didn't know much about this movie, almost nothing. I found the first couple of minutes very scary and disturbing. The atmosphere was frightening and the whole story somewhat obscure and mysterious. I didn't know where it was going. The ending was a big disappointment for me. I don't know whether it is connected to the guy, who played the son or just the storyline I didn't like.
The actors were otherwise very good, especially Toni Collette.
I wouldn't watch it for a second time, that's for sure.",7,0,1,23 February 2019
Justice League," so booring
","I am not a fan of the Marvel comics characters or films but this one was so far the worst I've seen. It took me 3 days to get to its end. The CGI bad guy looked rather basic, and I found it irritating. Batman looked a bit fat and even Alfred seemed more capable than him. The only positive happening in the movie is the resurrection of Superman.",2,0,3,21 June 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," terribly long
","I waste of time. Dicaprio played his role very well and so did Brad Pitt. there were some funny scenes in it but all in all it is way too long and not much happens in all the time. I loved the dog scenes though, for that I am glad that I eventually watched it but otherwise it is not worth it. The 'story' is told in almost 3 hours and there are about 2 suspenseful scenes in it. The main part is the last 10 or 15 minutes and that's it.",3,2,5,29 December 2019
