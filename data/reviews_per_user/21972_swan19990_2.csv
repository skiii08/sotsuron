Vertigo," God, that was awful...
","What are these unrealistic characters, and why is this man so obsessed with the woman. There's no foundation for being so crazy about her, it just happens out of nowhere, and it's almost as if the story wants to portray how manipulative women are. Or maybe this man just never understood how much she troed to get away from him without being able to succeed due to her fragility.",4,2,9,24 March 2018
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Bad acting, fabulous acting.
","Just watched this movie, and through the entire movie i thought whether it was a 8/10 or 9/10. But I ended up giving it 7 be cause of Emma Watson and possible reasons that she's casted for this movie. She ruins the whole thing, haven't seen Harry Potter besides from the first two, and had forgot all about her facial mimics. She overplays too much, her eyebrows is uncontrollably and moves all over her face. And on top of that, she never make it feel like she's a 'The Smith's' kinda girl. This movie scores a bit on pretentiousness since they could have chosen thousands of other actors to play that role, who would have done a much greater and a lot more true job. Though EW really pulls this movie down Logan Lerman really draws it up to be a top movie. His acting is fabulous and I had sympathy and reliability to his role the entire movie through. To me his performance really could have made it a 9/10-kinda movie. Ezra performs as I'd expect from him. He's a good actor, and always a energetic and reliable young man that I hope to see evolve into more movies. I love him. Watch 'Let's Talk About Kevin' too if you like him as an actor.Writing: 8,5/10 ≠ Camera/clipping: 7/10 ≠ Morale/story: 8/10Emma: 4/10 ≠ Ezra: 7,5/10 ≠ Logan: 9/10 (feels weird to give so different characters for acting in same movie)Overall: 7/10",8,3,7,19 December 2012
