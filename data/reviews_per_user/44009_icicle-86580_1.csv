Hereditary," Extremely Low Budget. and Boring
","I was so disappointed in this movie, seams like it was made on a $1000 budget.
Jaws was more suspenseful than this. this film to me was worse than 'The Blair Witch' the old 3D film 'The Amityville Horror' was better than this.
I never jumped once, I had to walk away from this movie it was super slow, had a very stupid beginning",1,3,7,24 June 2018
