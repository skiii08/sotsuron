The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The world disappeared
","For the brief time at the theater watching this movie, I was so involved with the characters and story that I really felt that the world had disappeared.For me the movie hit a lot of my life in a very personal way. I was never an outcast or somebody with the issues the main characters faced, but life in general has its way of throwing challenges that we all have to face at some time or another. I felt the acting was very well done. Everybody seemed quite sincere in their presentation of their character, which really made me feel like I was watching somebody's life rather than a movie.The movie left me very pensive even days after seeing it, which many movies don't seem to achieve (for me at least..) I think this movie really speaks a loud tone, especially in this country of gun violence by young children. Perhaps the problems and backgrounds of the main characters may give an idea of why those few young people (and even older) decide to kill. Well done overall. One of the best films I've seen in a while.",10,3,6,1 January 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," A different approach
","It seems there's a divide between those who really enjoyed it and those who really did not. Very few in-betweens.I believe Anderson does things differently for a reason. He demonstrated that you don't need to know a character's entire history to understand them or their circumstances. I read from a reviewer that they disliked the monotone style acting. Again, it's an unconventional approach to acting, but gives it a likable feel. Everybody has a melancholy attitude and some sort of sad story. Their acting style shows, in my opinion, that they're not happy nor completely sad, but simply in a gray area in life where they're not sure what they should be. There seems to be a standard of what good acting or good movies are supposed to be. The rigidity that some people have really blind them from what creativity the director is trying to convey. People tend to place a standard and can't open their mind to new or different concepts.The world set by Anderson is spelled out well by the narrator. The scenarios maintain a sense of realism, but there are moments (often quite funny) of unrealistic happenings. Taken from a rigid perspective, this could leave a person soured. However, if you view it from a perspective of perhaps a grandfather embellishing a story, then you can see why the abnormal tends to happen from time to time and you can really get what's going on.I guess what I'm trying to say, is that sometimes we need to let go of rules and expectations, and let the story be told. A seasoned director such as Anderson does things for a reason, and if you're not getting it, you probably are one of those rigid people I mentioned in my blathering above.",9,7,13,1 January 2013
