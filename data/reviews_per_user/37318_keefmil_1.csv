Blade Runner 2049," Do You Need To Have Seen The Original? ..er.. YES!
","I watched Blade Runner (Final Cut) a few days ago to remind me of the world and notice the 'inner references'. Having done so and now seen BR2049, I can say you won't appreciate the main plot to BR2049 without having seen it. Harrison Ford isn't in it just to sell tickets, it really is Blade Runner + 30 years. Whilst the cast are all good and there's some interesting concepts, the main thread is what happened after Rachel & Deckard left together at the end of Blade Runner. I watched the shorts on YouTube ahead of BR2049 and really enjoyed those - although '2038' & '2048' both feel like deleted scenes from BR2049, they are worth watching. BR2049 - Visually/musically: great but actually really proved that it was visually amazing in the '80s and hard to top. I don't feel the need to see another Denis Villeneuve anytime soon.Way....tooo...looong!! I really enjoy Ryan Gosling, but the pace matched his usual mood far too wellI would have liked a standalone story about Ryan Gosling being a Blade Runner, not a direct sequel to the first one, (And a definition of why they are called Blade Runners a well!) so more like a reboot I guess.",5,4,9,10 October 2017
