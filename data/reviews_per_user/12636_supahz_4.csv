The Blair Witch Project," Hype, hype, hype... bad, bad, bad
","Whew, what a stinker.  This wasn't scary, creepy, or intriguing, the characters were irritating and moronic and generate no viewer sympathy towards them, and the story and its conclusion left those of us who haven't seen the website (which gives MUCH NEEDED background) scratching our heads in confusion.If you're expecting a really classic, scary horror film, you're going to be really disappointed.  And as exit polls are indicating, a lot of us are really disappointed (60 percent of the 600 polled who said they 'couldn't wait to see movie,' ended up giving the film a C, and those who were just accompanying their friends, and who, presumably, had no strong interest in the film, gave it an F).  That pretty much sums it up.",1,2,4,11 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is a very entertaining, fun, and eye-popping adventure
","Perhaps you've heard about a few less-than-stellar reviews for the latest Star Wars film.  Considering the hype and expectations of this film, you could be certain that a number of reviewers would be exceedingly tough on the film.  Well, ignore all of that.  If you enjoyed any of the previous installments of Star Wars then you'll enjoy The Phantom Menace.We all know George Lucas and his style of storytelling... let's just say that he speaks better with visuals than with words.  But what visuals! This has got to be the most visually stunning film ever made.  Lucas has done on film what Tolkien did in novels... created a wholly believable, realistic universe.  To be able to translate that to film and to do so convincingly is an amazing achievement.  Chances are that you'll find yourself wanting to see this film a couple of extra times just to see all of the scenery, creatures, the pod race, and the light saber duels again.The dialogue isn't exactly Shakespeare, and the character development and relationships aren't exactly deep.  Then again, the Star Wars series isn't about that sort of thing.  Shakespeare in Space might be an interesting idea, but its time has yet to come!  What we have in Menace is a decent script with solid characters, respectable acting and a heavy reliance on visual storytelling ... by the way, this is also what we had with the other Star Wars films.  We might gripe a bit about how the story is too adult for kids and too childish for adults, but that's something that we can live with, considering the end product.My biggest gripe about SW:TPM concerns the comic relief character, Jar Jar Binks.  He is at times irritatingly childish, and made me recall how I thought the Ewoks really detracted from Return of the Jedi.  He does manage to be amusing at times, but his accented English was so muddled that I didn't understand 1/4 of what he said.  Also, his body movements smacked of a computer-generated effect, and not so much a living, breathing being.  I found myself wanting less Binks silliness.A minor gripe is the short-lived career of Darth Maul, who made for quite the menacing, animalistic, evil dark force.  He had great potential as a precursor to Darth Vader's dark side.  But his on-screen time was exciting, and his light saber duels were eye-popping and thrilling.In the end, this film isn't going to satisfy the viewer who thinks Ingmar Bergman is the greatest thing in filmmaking.  However, any viewer who enjoyed the previous Star Wars films will be very pleased with Menace. This is a movie for fans, not for critics, and it should enjoy much-deserved great success.  When the film is over, and you're swimming in a sea of fantastic images, excited thoughts of what will come in the next film, and trying to figure out when you'll come back to see Menace again, you'll realize that you were entertained for 2 hours and the time flew by.  I wish I could say that about most movies I see.",5,1,2,19 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," EWS Fails To Live Up To The Kubrick Legacy
","I like Stanley Kubrick.  What director can boast of such a wide variety of films and styles while maintaining such a high level of work?  Few, and Kubrick was one of them.  The man was a filmmaking genius.  No one can argue that point.  However, we CAN argue the merits of individual films within a lifetime of work, and EWS would have to rank as a major disappointment when measured against Kubrick's past achievements.The film was beautiful visually.  Kubrick certainly had his own vision, as every good director does, and his fans certainly won't be disappointed from this perspective.  As far as the craft of making films goes, EWS was often fantastic.  However, the actual story drags in places, which isn't good for such a long film.  In fact it was so much so that I heard some of the 30 or so patrons in the theater begin to make comments to the screen about it. Some movies are meant to be interactive, with cheering and such, but when a film generates only 'get on with it!' and lots of 'sheesh'es, it's not a good thing.Sydney Pollack was extremely solid in his role.  Nicole Kidman's rear end did a fine job.  And the whole scene of the orgy party was very well done. Another highlight was Alan Cumming, who provided a much-needed wake-up and comic relief as the hotel clerk.  But these were not enough to save the film.I suppose that we should all play nice and rave about EWS, seeing as the master filmmaker died just after its completion.  And I suppose that we should also go along with some fawning critics and claim this is a wonderful film, worthy of praise alongside truly amazing Kubrick films like 2001 and Dr Strangelove, because, after all, it's his last film.  We should, I suppose, also ignore  Nicole Kidman's weak performance (her pot smoking scene was laughable, and performance generally shallow), Tom Cruise's overwrought emotional performance (which was, barring the often senseless crying and whining, nicely done), a piano soundtrack that threatens to cause insanity, and a totally inadequate and weak end scene.  Why?  Well, it was Kubrick's last film, of course.Baloney.  The truth is, unless you're serious Kubrick fan, or a die-hard Kidman or Cruise fan, you're bound to be disappointed.  Like mystery?  It's here only as a misleading force.  Like romance?  Look elsewhere.  Want drama?  There's some, but it's fairly bland stuff.  EWS takes on many angles and delivers on precious few of them.  True, it's nice to have someone take a 'mature' look at sex and relationships, and to do it intelligently and seriously.  Intelligent films are a good thing, when done right.  There are elements of genius in this film, but it simply doesn't come together in a way that relieves the boring stretches and overshadows the weak performances and ending.I can't imagine that this film is going to be a favorite among the general movie-going public.  I'm sure that that's just how die-hard Kubrick fans would want it, and that's great for them.  However, to fans like myself who have enjoyed Kubrick's work in the past, and had high expectations for this film, it's a disappointment.  Looking back now I can't understand the secrecy or hype around the movie.  And I'm guessing that neither will most movie fans.",1,1,3,17 July 1999
Signs," Disappointing (Spoiler)
","Disappointing.  The majority of the film was okay, and the acting was at the high level you'd expect given the cast.  But the whole time I'm sitting here thinking 'okay, what's going to be the gimmicky ending this time?'... and it was pretty weak.  Still, anything with suspense, aliens, and Mel Gibson can't be all bad.  'Signs' is a good movie.  But given Night's track record and style, what you expect him to deliver simply falls short this time.The aliens were an interesting story to work with... crop circles and all... and their part of the story was quite entertaining.  The news 'footage' of the alien at the children's party was very eerie, and the scenes in the cornfields were quite tense.  But the underlying Mel Gibson personal struggle story line was pretty weak... a disillusioned priest who in the end returns to God because of the alien incursion.  Right.  Nevermind that an actual alien incursion would turn the bible on its ear and toss most of it out of the window.And the 'zinger' at the end was laughably weak... junior is saved from the alien poison gas because he has had an asthma attack that left his throat closed and kept the poison out.  Yeah, right.  I have asthma.  If you have an asthma attack that closes your breathing off, you can kiss your sweet patootie goodbye... you aren't surviving.  But I hear you saying 'it was a miracle, that's the point'.  No, the only miracle would be if anyone thought this was a clever ending.  Night's gimmicky endings are seeming pretty strained these days, having gone from excellent in 'Sixth Sense' to pretty unbelievable but still chilling in 'Unbreakable' to downright silly in 'Signs'.I'd still recommend this film, but if you're looking for the great, insightful, mind-blowing ending you got in 'Sixth Sense', you'll be disappointed.  The gimmick is starting to get old.",3,1,1,19 April 2003
