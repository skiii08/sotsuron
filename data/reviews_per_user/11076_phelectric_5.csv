Ford v Ferrari," Anyone rating this less than a 6 or 7 is insane
","This is by far the best movie of the year. I honestly watched it twice in one day. Anyone reviewing this movie less than a 7 must be the most up tight egocentric, progressive trash monkey walking this planet.",10,1,6,28 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I expected better.
","In this day and age a new Star Wars movie should be great. These movies have about the same depth as all the marvel movies.Snooze fest compared to what we should be getting for the budgets that are allowed.But everyone buys this mediocre stuff and they make millions. So they are too scared to stray from the guaranteed money path. Too much at stake.I dunno... I just don't get Hollywood anymore these days. I see unique shows and movies on Netflix all the time. Hollywood is just too vanilla cookie cutter for the amount of resources they have at their disposal.It's a shame.All in all it's an okay movie. Great CGI, great special effects. Mediocre story and acting. That's about it.",6,5,7,5 May 2020
Joker," Great actor but dull movie
","I'm sorry. I just didn't like it. Phoenix probably over acted this role due to everyone thinking the joker role is the holy grail of hardcore acting roles.Looks at ledger and prefrontane. Ledger did it best for the dark role, prefontane I'd say is okay. Phoenix tried to make it into a darker role. But something I didn't find captivating or entertaining. I just found it sad. A sad person with a sad story. And it made me feel sad. That's it.",6,3,8,11 February 2020
Parasite," It's a 7 star movie people, let's be honest here.
",Let's make this quick. For a korean movie it's an absolute 10/10!! All day baby.Now comparing it to all movies ever made.....it's a 7. And I'll say a very solid 7.I'm glad people are loving on it so the Korean film industry gets more recognition. I think they are doing great things and soon some truly wonder greatness will pop its little head up out of there.,7,3,22,29 January 2020
Da 5 Bloods," It's okay, but not good
","Acting was so so. Plot had some holes. Personally I didn't care for the old school film look. Music... some good, some really not. Anyway it's not a bad movie but more like a B flick. Kinda surprised, I thought I would have more action and wouldn't be so long.",5,0,4,14 June 2020
