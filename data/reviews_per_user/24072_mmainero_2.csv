Requiem for a Dream," Deliciously Dark and Arty
","Forget about gritty realism. This movie is about the exaggerated unrealism that lies at the core of the addictions the characters experience. Their tragic consequences are as unlikely as the dreams of grandeur they lovingly nurture. All of the flaws to realism should make it apparent to the viewer that these are not the actual circumstances, but are instead the nightmares of feeling as the dream slips away. It's a story of people desperately fighting to rise above their reality, while descending further into the murky mess of addiction. Do they really end up in the brutal condition the movie leaves them? Of course not--that is just a different kind of fantasy, the fantasy of fear that has replaced their summer fantasy of hope and belief. Some people may see this as a warning against drug use, but I see it as a movie about the danger of self-delusion.",9,0,1,7 August 2015
Now You See Me," If you have never seen a movie before, you might like this one.
","Thoughts on this movie: 1. Seems obvious and done before. 2. Wait, who is the movie about? Are the magicians the protagonists, or are the FBI/Interpol guys? Or maybe it's that mastermind, or the debunker? Not sure where this is going. 3. Okay, they've explained all that, and yes, it was obvious and done before but looks like they got that out of the way, and maybe there's something more to come. 4. Hmm, something more to come looks like car chases and every person in the movie acting like they've never seen a movie or a criminal before. 5. Wow, in addition to being magicians, hypnotists and sleight of hand experts, these guys are also frickin Ninjas. 6. Jesse Eisenberg is playing the same character he played in that Facebook movie, and I'm perplexed as to how Mark Zuckerburg developed those ninja skills. 7. Two Words: Far. Fetched. 8. Two more words. Corn. Ball. 9. You may enjoy having a few drinks with friends and mocking this movie.",3,1,4,25 January 2015
