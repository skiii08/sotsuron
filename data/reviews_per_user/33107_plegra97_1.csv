Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funniest movie I have ever seen... and I wasn't even an Ali G fan!!
","I went into this movie not knowing what to expect. I was not a big Ali G fan and hadn't seen much Borat stuff outside of the movie previews. I went to see it because of the ridiculous amounts of high praise it was getting from critics and regular moviegoers... I mean how many comedies get 3 1/2-4 stars?? Now having seen it, I completely agree with all the accolades this movie has gotten. I can not remember seeing a funnier movie or laughing so hard in my entire life. I don't think I stopped laughing for more than 30 seconds during the first hour of Borat. The last 20 minutes were a little slow but still very funny. Overall this movie is a 10 (not in the same way Godfather is a 10, but if a comedy can possibly reach a 10, this was it).BTW, the scene with Borat and Azamat rolling around in the bed has to be the single funniest scene in the history of film, hands down!",10,2,16,6 November 2006
