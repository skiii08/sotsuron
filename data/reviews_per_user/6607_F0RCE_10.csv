The Rock," Definitely underrated!
","'The Rock' combined action, adventure, comedy, romance, special effects and a great plot into one of the biggest worldwide blockbuster action films in decades. Add to the mix, Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris and a great supporting cast including John Spencer, William Forsythe and David Morse, and 'The Rock' is one of the best ways to spend two hours. This film also devotes a great deal of time and effort to character development, something that most action movies neglect. This film is definitely underrated and is worth more praise than it has received.",10,287,342,21 March 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The culmination of a great series.
","Many feel that the first two installments of the 'Star Wars' trilogy overshadow the final film.  I beg to differ.  At first glance it may seem this way however to the true 'Star Wars' fan this film represents closure and a culmination of this incredible story.  The most obvious is the fall of the Empire to the Rebel Alliance.  In this film we also see the death of master Yoda.  To the casual observer Yoda's life ends in the first part of the film and Obi-Wan Kenobi passed away in the first film.  However looking closely at Luke in this film, we can see that Yoda and Obi-Wan are manifested through his thoughts and actions. 
He believes that Darth Vader can be turned back to the good side because of the good that is still inside of him.  Luke pursues and exploits this conflict and in the end, the fall of the Emperor at the hands of Vader, is the final chapter in the life of Anakin Skywalker.  Luke had indeed turned his father back.  In this universal conflict between good and evil, the good side prevailed.  In addition to the confrontation of Vader, Luke's realization of Leia as his sister is critical.  In the final duel with Vader, Luke's thoughts of his friends, the Alliance and most of all his sister, finally convince him that he must confront Vader.  His initial reluctance to fight was admirable yet he knows that his sister will not be safe as long as Vader and the Emperor are alive.  'Return of the Jedi' also features Luke as a fully developed Jedi.  After he defeats his father, Luke realizes his ability and therefore in the eyes of the Emperor, he must die.  Meanwhile in regards to Han and Leia, we get the implication that there are feelings between both of them and they will end up together.  I seriously suggest that those who do appreciate what George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan have put together in this final chapter, take another look at it and look deeper into what is really going on.  Since before I can remember I have always considered that 'Empire' was my favorite of the series, however now I can honestly say that 'Return of the Jedi' has taken over.  It the final chapter in one of the greatest stories ever told.  Luke has come full circle.  He has become a Jedi Knight and Yoda and Obi-Wan continue to live and exist in Luke's actions.  The fall of the Emperor and Darth Vader as well as the turning of Anakin back to the good side are the historic events that occur during this saga.'You were right. You were right about me. Tell your sister... you were right.' -Anakin Skywalker",Null,0,0,25 March 2001
Predator," Schwarzenegger at his best!
","The plot of 'Predator' alone would make it a great action film.  Add to this Arnold Schwarzenegger probably the most recognizable face in the world along with Jesse Ventura, Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham, and Bill Duke, and you have one of the toughest cast of bas asses ever assembled. 
The incredible brilliance of director John McTiernan is evident in this classic example of a film that is the true definition of the action genre. The music of Alan Silvestri only enhances this film's ability to tell a story and tell it well.In this film, Schwarzenegger is at his best.  He plays a character that is well suited for him.  As he did in 'Commando' he plays an extremely jacked soldier that fights to the death against impossible odds.  This is what he does best.If you love the whole tough guy, blood, guts and guns genre this is for you. A definite must see!",Null,0,0,25 March 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Schwarzenegger is back!
","Very few sequels surpass their predecessor.  'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Godfather' are the few exceptions that come to mind.  Add to that list 'Terminator 2:  Judgment Day'.This remarkable film not only beats the original but does not require you to have seen the first film.  The plot of 'T2' is self-contained.  In this sequel we see John Connor (Edward Furlong) as a ten year old rebel.  He lives with his foster parents because his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) has been committed to a mental hospital because of her claims that a terminator had come to kill her in 1984.A terminator has been sent back to kill John.  The T-1000 (Robert Patrick) which is more advanced than the original terminator, is sent back to eliminate the future leader of the human resistance.  To protect John, the resistance sent back a T-800 (Schwarzenegger).  The T-800 must protect John throughout the film and as John attempts to break his mother out of the institute.  The T-800, Sarah, and John must now attempt to sabotage Cyberdyne Industries the company that will eventually create the technology that will lead to the computer takeover of the future.This film is unique in many ways.  Character development is a critical element to the plot.  In this sequel, we see a transformed Sarah Conner.  In the original, she was reliant upon Reese (Michael Biehn).  In 'T2' we see her as a self-reliant, mentally tough warrior.  She is in peak physical condition and trained in weaponry.  She along with the T-800 take on the responsibility of protecting John, despite the fact that she must overcome her initial distrust of the terminator.  We also see a development of the T-800 in a sense.  Throughout the film John tries to help him act more human-like.  In addition to the plot, the cast is another high point of the film. Schwarzenegger is obviously at his best, Linda Hamilton does a great job reprising her role as Sarah.  The newcomer to the film is Edward Furlong, and I must say he does well for an untrained actor.  He brings attitude and a sense of toughness to the character.  A great supporting cast including Joe Morton, Earl Boen, and Robert Patrick as the evil and stoic T-1000 also make this film what it is.  Patrick is not physically intimidating yet makes up for it with his dark demeanor.  He is the perfect villain.Special effects are truly the highlight of 'T2'.  The computer effects as well as the stunts and makeup are highly deserving of praise.  The special effects department does a great job of bringing the T-1000's 'liquid metal' effect to the screen.  The stunts and fight sequences between the two terminators are very well choreographed and filmed.  This film is worth watching for the special effects alone.'T2' is one of the greatest movies ever created.  It combines a great cast and story with incredible special effects and stunts.  This is a must see for any film fan.",9,1,1,29 March 2001
The Patriot," Stand up and salute the red, white and blue!
","Very rarely does a film inspire you to think about how and why we have a free and democratic society.  'The Patriot' does just that.  After watching this summer blockbuster I thought about all those that have given there lives against impossible odds to preserve our way of life. 
Mel Gibson does a tremendous job as Benjamin Martin, a hero of the French and Indian War is forced into the Revolution in order to protect his family. Heath Ledger provides the perfect compliment to Gibson playing his ambitious son, Gabriel.  A terrific supporting cast including Chris Cooper, Tom Wilkinson, Jason Isaacs, and Tcheky Karyo also contribute to this film's ability to capture its audience in this gripping tale about the fight for our nation's freedom. In addition to the cast and the brilliance of Roland Emmerich, the technical aspects and special effects deserve all the praise that they have received. The open-field battle scenes are incredible.  The costume design department did a great job of re-creating the attire of the colonial days.  Each and every detail was perfected to give the audience a true sense of what it was like to live at this time in history.Finally I would like to give credit to John Williams for his masterful score.  The music was an aspect of the film that helped to tell the story, set the mood, and draw the audience into the story.  This film is well worth any time that you put into it.  The DVD also contains materials that are a perfect supplement to this great film, and I recommend that if you enjoyed the film, you pick up the DVD.Oscar snub of the year!",9,0,1,25 March 2001
Caddyshack," You're crazy if you didn't love this film.
","'Caddyshack' is one of the greatest comedies ever produced.  This film is spirited and smart and is written in the tradition of National Lampoon. Harold Ramis is one of the funniest and most intelligent film makers of our time.  Add to this the writing abilities of Brian Doyle-Murray and Doug Kenney and you have creative ability that has yet to be matched.  Of course there is the all-star cast reminiscent of the Second City and Saturday Night Live.  Chase is hilarious without trying to be, and Bill Murray is terrific playing a part that suits him well.  Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight are very talented actors and make the film what it is.  A great supporting cast including Michael O'Keefe and Cindy Morgan are also a key to success.  This film has it all, a great story, hilarious yet simple humor, and a cast that is one of the best ever assembled for this type of film.  'Caddyshack' is an undying film that should be and will be enjoyed by generations to come.  It captures the spirit of Ramis and the other film makers that defined the early to mid '80's film-making.",8,0,0,24 March 2001
Rocky," An indomitable spirit is personified!
","**WARNING: THIS COMMENT MAY INCLUDE SPOILER INFO**It is very hard to try and put into words what this film is. This is the first movie I can remember watching as a young child and it would be safe to say that it may be my favorite of all-time. 'Rocky' is a stirring tribute to the never say die and never give up attitude that it's title character possesses and ultimately brings him from rags to riches. This film teaches us that anyone has a chance to succeed and that is a lesson that every young child should learn early in life.What Sylvester Stallone wrote is not simply a script but a life lesson. We can easily become involved in the lives of the characters that he created.

Direction, cinematography, photography, and choreography all contribute to this film's success.The characters and the personalities are charted and developed throughout the film and the entire series.

Die Hard," The film that defined a genre.
","'Die Hard' is a film that defined a film genre.  Critics and film fans alike have looked to this film as one of the most influential films in recent years.  This film literally has it all.  Not only does 'Die Hard' give us an incredibly charismatic hero, but also villians that the audience loves to hate, an underlying love theme, action, comedy, and special effects that were very well done.  The look and feel of 'Die Hard' emerged from brilliant director John McTiernan.  At its core the plot seems to revolve around one cop's crusade to defend innocent civilians against terrorists.  However with this film the viewer must take a step back and look deeper into the film. In this film fan's opinion 'Die Hard' is based on love.  John McClane's love for his estranged wife is his motivation to go on and survive.  McClane, our hero is portrayed in an interesting way.  McClane is an incredibly vulnerable man.  He takes unfathomable amounts of punishment and continues to go right at the terrorists.  The broken glass in his feet, the numerous cuts and burns and the various beatings handed to him have not deterred his fight.  McClane's battle is similar to that of Rocky Balboa who competed so dramatically against Apollo Creed, because of the strength and encouragement from his woman.  This love theme should not however overshadow the achievement of this film in terms of special effects, plot, and directing. McTiernan crafted an amazing picture that not only kept the audience guessing but also tells a story with characters the viewer can associate with.  From the beginning of the film the audience is immediately supporting McClane.  This film should be recognized not only as a an action film with great fight scenes and incredible special effects but also a story about love, determination, and the human spirit.",9,1,1,9 June 2002
The Great Escape," One of the greatest stories ever told.
","'The Great Escape' is a classic example of WWII cinema.  In addition to the all-star cast, the historical significance of the film is what will capture your heart.  The prisoners were ready and willing to give their lives for the Allied cause, and that is what I will always remember.  Humor is something rarely seen in a war movie but director John Sturges does a great job of inserting comic relief into the film.  This film is one for all ages and the story it tells acts as a model by which a person should approach life.  These prisoners show us that by constantly thinking and acting on the beliefs that they hold dear, anything is possible.",9,1,2,25 March 2001
