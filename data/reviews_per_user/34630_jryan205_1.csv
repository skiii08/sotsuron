Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Yakshamash! This film is very NICE!
","I've been a Sacha Baron Cohen fan for many years but always knew Borat could be so much more than a sketch character. AND HERE IT IS!!! Put simply, this is the most offensive, hilarious and gut-wrenchingly squirm in your seat film i have ever seen! I laughed like a 2 year old playing peek-a-boo! Then again....so did the rest of the cinema. Borat and his Producer, Asamat Bagatov, set off across the USA on a mission of enlightenment. Meeting an extremely varied mix of Americans along the way. From a group of disgruntled feminists, 'c'mon baby give me a smile!', to a rodeo crowd who don't enjoy Borat's Kazakh National Anthem being sung to the tune of theirs! This film will show you just how funny life can be without an understanding of the words; Political Correctness! Watch it NOW! *Do not watch if you are of a nervous disposition!*",10,3,17,15 November 2006
