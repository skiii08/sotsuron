The Ring," Tense, but rubbish
","Saw this film and thought that it was fairly poor.  A good horror film should make you feel that it can happen to you - the classic being The Sixth Sense, where you go round for days expecting cupboards to be open when you go in to the kitchen.  At one point, you think that you're going to be affected to because you've watched the film that killed the kids, but then when you see how they died, its easy to dismiss.Having said that, it did manage to keep the tension for pretty much the whole of film.  Not scary tenstion, but kept you into it, especially if you watched it with a jumpy girl as I did.I thought that the twist at the end of the film was good, especially considering that I had guessed most of the course of the plot within about 5 minutes.I would recommend that this is a hire film, not one to buy.",Null,0,0,1 April 2003
