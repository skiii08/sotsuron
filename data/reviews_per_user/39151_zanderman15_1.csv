Requiem for a Dream," Powerful
","It shows you normal life and how your dreams of fame won't happen to a lot of people. How people on it are supposedly gods and you can't taste that. In addition to that it shows how the addiction sits in and never truly lets go. If you really watch it there is addictions to other things that you may not catch until the second time you watch the movie. But the message is the same.You watch the rise and eventual fall of each main characters in the movie. You see when or during they're hooked and watch as they crumble under the weight of they're own addiction. And the acting is some of the best ever seen. This movie will truly blow you away. It's not something that will leave you saying,'Good movie what else is on.' You will stay in the same blown-away mood until the next morning. I recommend this movie to be watched in schools without talking and to only watch the movie. Instead of Gary the drug free Elephant during pep rallies. Then they'll understand how bad drugs are. Conclusion....A MUST SEE. So powerful you'll tear up. It's that overwhelming.",10,1,2,19 July 2006
