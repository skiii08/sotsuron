The Incredible Hulk," An adequate film that never quite manages to pull the heartstrings like it would like to
","I've read today that Ed Norton has pulled out of the promotion for this film as he is unhappy with the final cut.I can kind of understand where he is coming from if this is the case.The Incredible Hulk is a decent enough comic book action film but i left the theatre with the feeling that they have failed to fully get to grips with the character and his dark inner workings.There is a lot of scope to go deeper into his psyche and explore the animal inside the man but any interesting dramatic themes are substituted for a computer generated frenzy and some pretty generic action film goings on.The film delivers as a spectacle though which is why most people will want to see it,the CGI looks like CGI but its not as bad as everyone seems to be making out.Norton does an okay job as Banner, injecting a little more life in to the character than a wooden Eric Bana managed in the previous film.There are some lighter moments of humour in the film and overall proceedings feel light and comic book, this may be why Nortons not happy.Hulk is not to be taken seriously though.If you let yourself get swept along you may enjoy it, i found it all a little tiresome but each to their own eih!?",6,3,7,14 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A frustrating experience and a bitter pill for Star Wars fans
","The weight of anticipation i felt for this film was beyond anything I've ever felt for a film.Maybe that was why i didn't enjoy the film? No, I've since watched it and hoped that was the reason but its failings go deeper and beyond sheer weight of expectation. This is a film that betrays its core audience.It's a confused film that spreads itself too thinly in the vain hope of entertaining a broad demographic.Unfortunately,the film fails desperately and leaves its audience flat.Jar Jar Binks is an awful character,Lucas may as well have just thrown Roger Rabbit into his epic saga.Binks is the tip of the iceberg though,the taxation plot thread will confuse kids and bore adults.The only saving grace is the character of Darth Maul,the problem is he's given little screen time and no back story.The are great effects too but one gets the feeling that effects are the reason the film exists.In his prime Lucas was an inventor and an explorer,Menace is a deeply flawed film with little going in its favour. A crushing blow to the Star Wars brand.",6,1,2,23 May 2008
The Young Victoria," Emily Blunt shines as 'The Young Victoria'
","Before seeing this film, my only experience of Emily Blunt acting in anything, was a horrible performance in 'The Devil Wears Prada', in which she was either miscast, or just didn't have the acting skills to convey. All of a sudden, here she is as 'The Young Victoria' and she's nothing less than sublime. The same can be said of much of the cast, I've never been a huge Paul Bettany fan, but he captured just the right balance of love/hate for his character. Mark Strong also, who seems to always get the baddie role is good. One questionable piece of casting, Miranda Richardson, forever 'Queenie' in 'BlackAdder' is also very good and i didn't find myself thinking of Baldrick or Edmund at all. The film is essentially, at heart, a love story, and a very good one it is. There's some great inventive camera work at times, which is never over indulgent, but actually serves the scenes well when it's sparingly used. The script is very good and the locations are grand and impressive. For anyone that loves this sort of thing, or just wants a brief history lesson, there's lots of offer.",8,1,1,1 January 2012
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Brilliant film making from a cinematic genius
","Spielberg has hit some highs in his career but i feel Raiders sums up his film making talents best.Its a rollicking adventure that has been imitated but never equalled.Im sceptical as to whether The Crystal Skull will live up to the hype but one things for sure, Raiders will endure for years to come as a classic of modern American cinema.A work colleague of mine recently put it to me that he felt it was a dated, badly edited film,my jaw dropped,was he looking at the same film as me?Such is my love for Raiders,i had to reconsider our friendship for a brief moment before agreeing to disagree.Raiders just leaps off the screen, Harrison Ford is a legend and delivers a great film performance as Indy.An all time great. 10/10 only because i cant give it 11.",10,2,4,7 May 2008
Se7en," Its rainy,dirty,scary,agonising,sinister and brilliant. One of the best films of the 90's
","Sensational.Amazing.What else cam i say?Superlatives do not do Se7en justice.It marked a return to form for director David Fincher after Alien3.Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are superb hunting the crazed John Doe serial killer.When i first watched this film i went straight to the door to make sure the lock was secure.It messed with my mind. David Fincher said in an interview around the time of its release that he wanted to make a film that scarred people like Jaws. He certainly achieved that in my book.The film lingers long in the memory after viewing it and that is a rare thing in todays throwaway Hollywood disposable film production.I own Se7en on DVD, its not a film that i would ever watch to cheer me up but its one i'll keep going back to remind me how great films can be. 10/10",10,1,2,26 May 2008
Memento," Sometimes, it's the way you tell 'em.
","Sometimes, it's the way you tell 'em. Such is true of Christopher Nolan's Memento. Based on a short story brother by Jonanthan Nolan, the film is both inventive and compelling as it tells it's story in small chapters moving backwards through the narrative. This editing style is unique to the point that you really feel as though you are witnessing something that has never been done before. The story itself is very simple, the execution is a work of sheer excellence. Guy Pearce is Leonard Shelby, a man who through personal tragedy has lost the ability to create new memories beyond ten minutes and has to to keep detailed records of everything he does in order to function. Early on we learn the catalyst for Leoonard's memory dysfunction was the murder of his wife. Through tattooed notes inked over most of his body, Leonard is slowly gathering clues as to who her killer may be. Christopher Nolan's film is an intimate experience that stays thoroughly focused as the details gradually unravel. In many ways it's the closest equivalent to a compelling page turner as you find yourself eagerly awaiting the next chapter and slice of information. That intimate focus really allows the viewer to become involved in the mystery and gives you ample opportunity within to play detective yourself. With a production budget of just $9m Memento a triumph of intelligent, low budget film making from a director and creative team that were clearly destined for greatness.",10,0,2,23 July 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Quentin Tarantinos crazy World War II show.
","After my second attempt to watch this film, i have to hold up my hands and admit that i was wrong. On first attempt, i felt the film was handicapped by Tarantinos writing style, i felt as though the characters in the film all sounded like Quentin which i felt was a problem. The second time i saw it, i relaxed a lot more and just let the film play. I must say, i enjoyed the strands of the story very much and the individual set pieces were very well acted and directed. The use of language was also very effective, French, German and English all play a crucial role in the film at various points. The performances are also a lot of fun and huge credit must go to Christoph Waltz for what is a the best depiction of a Nazi since Ronald Lacey in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. So, another big success for Quentin Tarantino, and a film that plays a lot better if you just forget he is in the directors chair and just enjoy it for all its madcap, gory brilliance.",9,2,5,22 November 2011
Iron Man 2," If you enjoyed Iron Man,you'll enjoy this entertaining sequel.
","Iron Man returns in this action packed and for the most part hugely entertaining sequel.Downey JNR is once again on good form as Tony Stark and there are fun new inclusions to the cast list including Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke.Rockwell very nearly steals the film from under Downey Jnrs nose delivering a highly enjoyable performance as a kind of Tony Stark wannabe.Mickey Rourke plays a Russian baddie but the director does a good job with his actors and never allows Rourke to become panto or over emphasised,he's just a brooding menace. The film does have it's shortcomings though.Like the first film,it does go all Transformers towards the end and it doesn't take long for CGI to bore but the chemistry of the cast and the fun being had does go a long way to paper over those particular cracks. Scarlet Johansson is introduced for no other reason than she looks great in a tight leather outfit. Gwyneth Paltrow also turns up without offering much more. Don Cheadle replaced Terrence Howard as Col Rhodes which is a shame for the continuity but on the whole the film fizzes with fun and thus delivers the very thing its target audience pay for.",7,0,2,22 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Weight of expectation is a terrible thing.Overlong and boring.
","This was clearly a film for a films sake.I sat myself down to watch it eager for a great time but 15 minutes in i found myself checking the counter on the DVD player to see how much time was left.To my credit i saw it though but i refuse to put myself through the third film as i imagine it'll be more of the same.Where was the direction?Gore Verbinksi gave us a perfect treat with the first film but he just churns this one out.Depp is obviously superb but the rest of the cast struggle to make any kind of meaningful impact.This film represents everything i dislike about Hollywood,a film makes money so they just throw together a weak story, add a load of digital effects and try and pass it off as art.In this case art is fart.",4,1,1,5 May 2008
Argo," Argo-on. Read my review.
","Winner of the best picture Oscar at the 2013 Academy Awards, Ben Affleck's film is a political thriller that tells a true story of incredible courage against the odds but don't let that put you off.Before Argo, Affleck's career in the director's chair (Gone, Baby Gone and The Town) was progressing in a very respectable ascent. With Argo, that ascent has fired it's rocket boosters and blasted out of the stratosphere fully cementing his reputation as an unlikely, but very exciting talent. Not content with sitting in the big chair and barking orders, Affleck also takes the lead role in this fascinating true story of a daring attempt to rescue American embassy workers trapped inside an unstable Iran in the late 1970′s.Having absolutely no prior knowledge of the events depicted in the film, I found myself gripped throughout as the drama unfolded. Thanks to period perfect production design and Affleck's basic ability to tell a story, the film is a huge success. It often occurred to me that the film shared similarities to Apollo 13 – not only because of the fine period detail – but also in the cutting back and forth between events inside Iran, and the drama back in 'mission control'.As with any story, the less you know going in the better time you're likely to have. Clearly, this is a tale told best in the most unfussy of directorial styles, and with that Affleck really comes through. Without over egging the pudding or giving in to hyped up sentimentality, Argo succeeds as an engaging thriller, a worthy history lesson and a fine film. Also, great use of Star Wars figures.",8,0,2,27 May 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A sure reminder of what a trip to the cinema should be about.
","The first and best by a country mile POTC film.It embodies everything that is fun about blockbuster cinema, great leads,relentless fun,fantastic music,clever script and a fizzing little story.The film arrived with no expectation, the trailer puzzled most folks but the film gathered momentum through glorious praise and word of mouth reviews.Others have said it but Johnny Depp is amazing in the lead role.The guy has played some distinctive roles in his time, Ed Scissorhands etc, etc but i feel that this is his defining moment. This is the role that people will remember him for.He improvises the character to wonderful effect and is joined by fun performances from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.Gore Verbinski has proved himself to be adept in the big league and even though the sequels clearly lacked inspiration,the best of his talents are on show here as he allows his Depp to work his magic.The following films have somewhat tarnished the look of this film by being overlong and largely boring but as a standalone pirate adventure film, look no further than this.",8,2,6,11 June 2008
Star Trek Into Darkness," You might feel like you've been here before, but a worthwhile trek.
","Surprisingly, it's been four years since we first met J.J Abrams' sexy, rebooted crew of the U.S.S Enterprise. In that time, you might be forgiven for not fully being able to recall exactly what happened first time around. The good news is, that doesn't really mattermuch.Without wasting a second or pausing for breath, 'Into Darkness' hurls us head-first into the chaos in a scene that owes a huge debt to Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. From then on, it's time to get reacquainted with our old/new friends as the plot centre's on a terrorist attack in future London -spot the Gherkin.What's pleasing about Into Darkness is that it's fun. Lots of fun. Abrams continues where he left off last time by keeping his film accessible and quick witted. For the die-hard Trekkie, the tone might still be too much brawn and not enough brain but given the track record of the odd/even numbered cinematic Trek's, it's a relief to finally get some consistency into the universe. In terms of character development, Chris Pine's Captian Kirk is 'as you were'. Arrogant and still with an eye for the ladies, Pine lacks the out-and-out charisma of William Shatner's iconic turn, but leads the line firmly in a physically demanding role.The truth is, Star Trek isn't trying to be 'The Empire Strikes Back', no- it's intention is to engage warp speed and visually thrill your pants off and for the most part, it succeeds. If there's a show stealer here though – and there is – it's in Benedict Cumberbatch's good old fashioned bad guy, John Harrison. The British actor revels in the role and brings a gravity to outer space that takes the film to a higher level whenever he's on screen. From the delivery of the lines, to the sheer presence and physicality of the performance, Cumberbatch is a joy throughout. Also, and once again Zachary Quinto's Spock is the pick of the Enterprise bunch. It's been said before, but if ever an actor were born to play a roleGetting full value out of Into Darkness, beneath the surface of it's light hearted, lens flared and colourful exterior might require a Star Trek history lesson. There are important things that happened in older movies that many younger viewers will never have seen, but for them, there's the fun of the discovery later down the line and for those of us who need no introduction, there's a sense of satisfaction that this alternate universe Trek is working out a lot better than anyone dared dream.",8,3,8,24 May 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Overwhelmingly underwhelming
","It always amazes me when a director with little to no experience within the genre of big Hollywood blockbuster is given the keys to the city and told go and continue the evolution of a valuable franchise. Im not saying Gavin Hood isn't a good film maker, Tsotsi was a very impressive drama film but just as we saw with McG (not a talented film maker) and the Terminator franchise, we hit a rarther big wall in that we have an overblown, loud and pretty uninteresting fireworks display.I like Hugh Jackman and his performance as Wolverine is fine,the problem with the film is that its very shallow in comparison to to Bryan Singers brace of X-Men pictures.Liev Scriber is great playing Jackmans unhinged brother but there isn't much else positive to report. There are a lot of fan favourite characters fleetingly introduces but never fleshed out. The film ends leaving no lasting impression and overwhelmingly underwhelms.",6,0,1,18 November 2009
Terminator Salvation," Not the disaster i was expecting.
","From the critical mauling this film received in the press i was expecting a bloated,Transformers style experience that would distance me from anything created by James Cameron and leave a huge dent in the pride of a proud franchise however, im glad to say i totally wrong. For all the mud thrown at this film i found it to be an efficient and functional Terminator film that is streets ahead of Jonathan Mostows T3. T3 was bad as it divorced itself from the serious tone set by Camerons films preffering to indulge in self parody and humour wheres as McGs film is much more straight laced and in keeping with the feel of Jim Camerons work. For out and out fans there are some wonderful references and it works as a post apocalyptic war movie.On the whole, a lot better than i was led to believe.",8,1,2,30 November 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," A blizzard of digital effects but nothing more
","As far as cheap disaster film is suppose this is a fairly good one.The problem is,this isn't a cheap film,it is a big expensive blockbuster that has a message about global warming at its heart and taking all things into account,falls short of expectation.The characters and plot seem almost inconsequential as nature takes its course and buries New York under ice and snow in a blizzard of digital effects that on this occasion actually look quite good.The story centres around climatologist Dennis Quaid trekking across the vastness of the US to save to his son who have been trapped in New York by the elements.Its all a bit painful,the dialogue doesn't help either,even experienced actors like Ian Holm cant give the thing much weight but a least the SFX look good and are the lasting impression of what is a heartless and mostly tedious experience.Roland Emerich films always seem to flatter to deceive,this film promises much but delivers little.",5,1,3,7 June 2008
Spider-Man 3," Fell short of expectation
",Although there was plenty of activity on screen this was easily the weakest of the Spider-Man films. The quality control has been disregarded this time in favour of lots of flashy effects shots.I think the design was to make people dizzy with the amount of visual fireworks so that they wouldn't notice the wafer thin plot.One of the main problems with the film is that it is overcooked.We have a villain too many in Sandman and Harry Osbournes role is over emphasised and at times misjudged by director Sam Raimi. Tobey Maguire is okay in the main role however he looks silly when asked to turn on the attitude once the Venom suit gets a hold of him. Kirsten Dunst isn't as endearing either and the whole love triangle fiasco is a calamity.All this drags down what should have been the crowning glory of an entertaining series so far. Shame .,6,0,1,23 May 2008
The Terminator," The Terminator has heart. Cameron might be well advised,less is more.
","Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it's release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more.",10,45,52,28 January 2011
Silent Hill," Visually appealing
","Viewers unfamiliar with the video game may find the events of Silent Hill a little baffling but watching it with the pre experience of playing the game sheds the film in a much more favourable light.I think Chirstophe Gans has structured a visually memorable piece that echoes the feeling of a bad nightmare.Radha Mitchell,in the lead role,is asked to do nothing more than run around and look the part but it is the visual aspect of the film that saves it credit.It has a very European feel,not a million miles from a Marilyn Manson rock video in truth but the look suits the subject matter.The film has its detractors and seems to have split opinion amongst fans of the game and general movie going folks alike.I say its a decent horror film with striking visuals a suitably eerie atmosphere. 7/10",7,0,1,13 October 2008
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," I could feel the cobwebs forming on my brain. Plodding and dull.
","I could feel the cobwebs forming on my brain as i sat fighting my body's natural reaction to shut itself down for two hours plus. I kind of wish i'd just let myself surrender to the slumber as ultimately i came away from this not rewarded or enriched, just impressed that i had the stamina to see it through. Now i know i fly in the face of popular critical opinion here, and i will say that that the acting talent functions perfectly well, but i can honestly say i was never gripped or inclined to care about the characters or events. I understand subtlety and how effective a slow build can be in film, and i know there's lovers of this film out there that will claim anyone that hasn't enjoyed it has A.D.D, but for me, the director placed little emphasis on making his film compelling and pandered more to a certain 70's style of film making. In summary i'd say Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was a well acted but plodding tale told at a one gear pace with little in the way of character depth or discovery. As a fan of the director of 'Let The Right One In' i was expecting something to really shake me in much the same way as 'The Usual Suspects' did, but sadly it made little lasting impression. Dull.",6,0,1,23 June 2012
The Bodyguard," An easy target for critics.
","The willingness to sacrifice oneself to save the life of another person is inherently romantic, which is the idea at the centre of The Bodyguard, a two-worlds-collide drama-thriller starring two of the hottest tickets of 1992's film and music scene, Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston. While it might make an easy target for critics, The Bodyguard is a film that connected well with audiences upon release. Much of that comes down to the perfect storm of three elements; Lawrence Kasdan's script (it rattled around Hollywood for years), Kevin Costner's leading man status and Whitney Houston's incredible vocal performance - particularly the mighty power-ballad 'I Will Always Love You', which ate up the pop charts. These three elements are competently stitched together by British director, Mick Jackson, who captures enough chemistry between the leads to paper over the gaping cracks that emerge. Costner carries his brand of quiet man chivalry, which gives Houston room to find her character in their scenes, which are always engaging. You can only guess, but it doesn't seem a stretch to imagine the similarities between her character and what her life was like. The writing tries to examine what it's like to live in the cocoon of celebrity, but the direction of the narrative becomes increasingly about the thriller aspect of the story, leaving some, but not much to chew over. When the finale comes, it's a messy combination of awkward positioning and bad logistics, culminating in a predictable, mostly underwhelming conclusion. That said, given the right mood, The Bodyguard is entertaining mainstream cinema, held aloft by its star credentials.",7,0,1,23 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Forget the Ewoks,Jedi is a fitting finale to a great trilogy.
","Im tired of hearing people say 'Oh yeah,Jedi is the weakest of the trilogy,nowhere near as good as the first two' I think people have been brainwashed by the media and so called film experts around the world. Return Of The Jedi is the joyous conclusion the original Star Wars trilogy deserved.Sue it has Ewoks,but come on guys,they weren't that bad.People are always banging on about how the Ewoks single handedly took down the mighty Empire but if you actually consider what happens all the little fur balls actually managed to do was to create a diversion so Han Solo and co can get the upper hand on the forest moon allowing the real battle to ensue in space.The Vader/Luke/Emperor face off is also incredibly powerful,i think people have seen it that many times they have just got teddy bear tunnel vision and forget what really makes the film tick.I say Return Of The Jedi is a fitting finale to cinemas best loved trilogy,it complements Empire beautifully and sees our heroes united and victorious.10/10",10,0,2,26 September 2008
Horrible Bosses," Same tone as The Hangover, funny though.
","Ever since 'The Hangover' stormed the box office a few years ago, the stock of the screwball adult comedy has risen significantly. If there's any film that in terms of tone Horrible Bosses could be compared to, then it's most definitely Todd Phillips' tale of drunken memory lapse in Las Vegas. How you feel about that film might determine whether your'e going to get much further than this sentence, for the characters and situations in Horrible Bosses are every bit as ridiculous as their hungover cousins. What this film has in it's favour however is three star studded horrible bosses all given full licence to indulge their inner over-actor. Kevin Spacey gleefully turns on the manipulation as Jason Bateman's nasty boss, Jennifer Aniston revels in sexing things up as Charlie Day's nymphomaniac dentist boss while Colin Farrell rounds things off a sleazy Tony 'Scarface' Montana wannabe and boss to Jason Sudeikis. All three bring a huge amount of enjoyment while clearly relishing the opportunity to let rip. As was the case in The Hangover, the further things progress, the more outrageous they become but it's clear from early on that this is the tone and despite the madcap antics, there are laughs aplenty. This isn't a film that people are going to be talking about for weeks afterwards, you might forget it and see it again on TV again in a few years only to remember that you found parts of it funny, but while it's on, it's perfectly good fun. While not as smart or incisive as say 'Office Space', it isn't without merit and will work well for anyone after indulging a spot of brainless knockabout comedy.",7,0,1,11 September 2012
Underworld Awakening," Mind numbingly boring.
","Exciting is a word i would attribute to the time spent watching paint dry, that is if the alternative was being told i'd have to sit through Underworld: Awakening again. After opting out of the third installment of the Underworld series, Kate Beckinsale returns as ice cool PVC clad vampire Seline in this tired fourth outing. In case you missed the previous Underworld films, (you really didn't miss anything) we get a recap introduction designed to bring you up to speed, and then without further ado it's headlong into the typically dingy looking, mind numbing action. By now anyone who's followed Underworld, knows just how adept Seline is at stylishly offing bad guys. From power sliding while simultaneously firing two automatic handguns, to gravity defying gymnastics it's all gotten very old, very fast. What's designed to be exciting is 'by the numbers' boring, as the almost non existent script meanders from witless exposition to the merest of character development. Seasoned actors Charles Dance and Stephen Rea show up to try and inject some heft, but nothing detracts from just how dull it all is. Beckinsale looks great, and as always she's suitably nimble but it's nowhere near enough to hang a film on, which is essentially what the producers are trying to achieve. With a budget of $70m and a global take of $160m, this is a series that seems to endure despite being as thin as the latex wrapped around it's protagonists tiny frame. With that in mind, more sequels seem inevitable. Where's that drying paint again?",2,3,6,1 August 2012
Rocky II," A good continuation and strong character performances
","Rocky II is a good continuation of the characters so strongly portrayed in the earlier film.Stallone seems completely at ease with his character to the point where its hard to imagine he's any different in real life.The cast all the return for this sequel and once again their strong performances lift the film above what should be its level.The main crux of the story is that Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed is out to regain his damaged pride and sets out to beat Rocky in a rematch in more style thus taking things more seriously this time round.Its hard not to root for old 'Rocko' during the fight scenes and Rocky II cements the character as one of cinemas most lovable and endearing.The Rocky films that followed in the 80's and 90's steadily decreased in quality but Stallones interpretation of the character was always spot on.Rocky II is in my opinion, the 3rd best Rocky film behind Rocky Balboa (2006) and Rocky (1975)",8,2,2,26 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the digital effects
","Clones is a slight improvement on the previous prequel The Phantom Menace.It is still heavily bogged down by a multitude of factors such as poor scripting,wooden acting and dizzying use of digital effects.Hayden Christensen as Anakin is far from convincing,his petulance makes him more hormonal teenager than potential Darth Vader.His scenes with Natalie Portman are cringeworthy and lack that deftness of touch inherent to a great acting performance.All the technical and creative problems cast aside,the main problem with Attack Of The Clones and the prequels as a whole for that they are redundant storywise.We know what happens.Gone is the tension and revelation of Empire Strikes Back,digital effects have lost their 'wow' factor and the film suffers badly for investing too much in them.Lucas is however, a man who listens to his detractors,the main comic relief of the previous film,Jar Jar Binks, is almost entirely omitted from this film,surely a reaction to the venomous repsone his over inclusion in 'Menace' provoked,proof indeed that the public gets what the public wants.The sad thing about the quality of these prequels is that they will inevitably tarnish the glowing reputation of the earlier films.Financially,George Lucas will have gained imeasurably from legions of fans aching for more from this galaxy far,far away.Artistically,he will be considered a has-been,out of touch with the modern cinema goer.In summary Attack Of The Clones could probably be better names Attack Of The Digital Effects.",6,3,6,19 February 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The best Rings film.2nd one had annoying walking trees, third one had an overlong ending that was a bit of a fluffy dream nightmare
","Of the Rings films i have to say that this is the one that stands out the most for me.Its a real thrill being introduced to these characters and the ending really leaves you wanting more,a feeling that slightly diminished as the films progressed.I love the depiction of the shire and Ian Holms turn as Bilbo.Each successive film managed its own tone but it was the promise of things to come that really grabbed me.I also feel as though the action is a lot more interesting in this adventure.In the sequels,when Frodo and Sam are isolated away from the group,something is slightly lost.That isn't a criticism of the next films its just that this one has a togetherness (its called Fellowship) that the others didn't possess.I also really like Cate Blanchetts performance and the walking trees in the second one, and overlong ending of the third one were slightly annoying. 9/10",9,0,0,26 May 2008
28 Weeks Later," Solid sequel
",What an unsettling movie!!I mean that in a good way.28 Weeks Later is sequel of unexpected quality.The film carries the tone of the first film very faithfully.Its heartening to see a quality sequel as the film library of the world has scant few.This is a very well thought out film that stays true to its origins and delivers some genuine frights.Id go as far as to say there are scenes in this picture that had me almost looking away from the screen and it takes something quite horrible to make me do that.I hope future film in this franchise continue to live up to this standard.This film carries all the elements of a good zombie/viral movie.The introduction is breathtakingly well staged with a flat out chase.The frantic energy will get your heart racing. 8/10,8,1,2,20 October 2008
Cold Mountain," A solid tale of love and survival with some questionable casting choices.
","Based on a book by Charles Frazier and adapted for the screen by Anthony Minghella, Cold Mountain is a broad, ambitious love story set against a backdrop of the American civil war (1861–1865). It has a cast that you imagine being assembled at Cannes, as almost every character we encounter on the journey (all 148mins of it) is instantly recognisable, and therein lies my beef. For any period piece brimming with big names, there's an inherent distraction from the material when each time we're introduced to a new Hollywood star. I found myself holding my breath as to whether he or she had the ability to adapt to the landscape of the time with an authentic southern accent. What's worse is when my fears are realised and actors like Ray Winstone, Jude Law and Nicole Kidman allow their accents to slip resulting in a character/audience detatchment that need never have been there. I understand the box office benefits to having star names dotted all over your poster, but in this case, a few more indigenous folks wouldn't have gone amiss. Casting issues aside, the film looks beautiful. Clearly, this is an ambitious piece and fittingly the cinematography is epic and sprawling. There's striking visual metaphors too. Apart from in the opening scenes, we see very little of the actual conflicts, although what we do see is brutal and bloody. Instead of witnessing soldiers dying, we see the crops on the farms and the unattended fields going to waste amid the absence of farmers to tend to them. It's symbolic of a country that was tearing itself apart from the inside. Essentially though, this is personal love story, but within that it's also a survival tale and the film stands and falls on buying into that love. I'm pleased to say that i felt it worked. Casting issues aside, such is the weight of what's happening in the background coupled with the obstacles our couple have to overcome to try to be together, that it's hard to deny some sort of emotional investment. That said, the initial set-up of the relationship, crucial to understanding and believing in the central love, could have been more played upon. Nicole Kidman is a fine actress yet here she lacks a sense of warmth. The times she shares the screen with a lively Renée Zellweger, she almost fades into the scenery. Additionally, Natalie Portman, in a brief role, brings real humanity and weight to proceedings leaving Kidman, the main star playing very much third fiddle. I'd have to say that although Cold Mountain is long and flawed, the backdrop events really help carry the film through some odd casting choices to help it become a good, but not great story of love's efforts to overcome the seemingly insurmountable. 3/5",7,1,2,22 July 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Unwanted parody of two of cinemas finest action films
","No matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",6,161,241,2 June 2008
Wanted," Wanted left me wanting.
","For the first half hour Wanted felt like a trailer.Adapted from a graphic novel the film never seems to settle,the actors seem ill at ease with the material and the impatience on the directors part leaves us with a messy hackneyed film of action set pieces and sci fi mumbo jumbo inbetween. The film tries far too hard to be cool which is a shame because im sure it could have been a better film if things would have just been done with a little less haste.James McAvoy,so convincing in Last King Of Scotland is hard to like in this role.Morgan Freeman seems totally non interested but to be fair hes given virtually nothing to do and just serves as filler between action scenes.Angelina Jolie is the real star of this film,she has astounding presence as an actress and suits the action genre,its just a shame we cant find a truly memorable action film for her to star in.In summary Wanted is a fast paced but legless action film that promises much but delivers very little.It leaves you wanting.",6,90,157,18 February 2009
Salt," Twists for twists sakes. Not as clever as it thinks it is.
","One thing that is true of Angelina Jolie is that she is a talented actress. Another thing is that she is a stunningly beautiful actress. The latter is to such an extreme that sometimes i find myself so entranced that i forget I'm watching a stinker of a movie. Now, I'm not here to trash Salt, yes its silly, yes its not as clever as it thinks it is but ultimately , its one of the better action films that Angelina has appeared in. Whats frustrating about Angelina Jolie in action films is not that she doesn't make the character believable, the contrary, you can tell she's committed and full throttle in every scene and her off screen enigmatic persona really adds a layer of intrigue when she plays characters like this, no its that the scripts often let her down. In Tomb Raider she was every inch Lara Croft but the films stank. In Wanted she played the calm, cool hard faced assassin to perfection while matching the boys in the physical action stakes, but the film was awful. In Mr And Mrs Smith, she played it for laughs with some strong action set pieces thrown in but the film didn't have the legs. Time after time, Angelina is let down by those around here not being up to her level. Salt, while being one of better action films (not saying much) is still bogged down by over indulging itself, throwing twists in for twists sakes.In a way, it feels like the film is a few years too late and we've seen the same twists done so many times ,we are fully expecting them. From Phillip Noyce i can be forgiven for expecting something a little more cerebral and engaging but ultimately Salt just feels like an attempt to start a franchise.",7,0,2,21 January 2011
Rocky IV," Good light entertainment.Stallone V Lundgren is one of the best fights of the Rocky series.
","Okay,hands up,i enjoyed Rocky IV.Sure,its shamefully cheesy and the concept of Rocko fighting the cold war and uniting the USA with the USSR is beyond the ridiculous but hey,its all good fun.This time round Balboa faces his hardest fight against man mountain Dolph Lundgren, the size difference between the men creates a real David and Goliath setting and has you rooting for the old slugger all the way.Its really hard not to get caught up in the fight.The boxing scenes are a little amped up for the movie experience but lets face it, we all love the underdog and that is what the core theme of the Rocky films are about.The films may have gradually weakened up to this point the the character is an icon of American cinema now and Stallone still looks the part ten years on from when he first introduced him.Its a guilty pleasure so i have to give Rocky IV a 6/10.",7,0,0,9 May 2008
The Machinist," Bleak film with an other worldly feel that features a recklessly committed performance from Christian Bale
","People will inevitably make comparisons to David Finchers Fight Club but El Maquinista deserves more credit than that.Christian Bales weight loss for the role is well documented but never ceases to amaze.Seeing an actor this committed to his craft draws you in to the film.The film was shot in Spain and has a kind of other worldly but bleak feel to it,a look i know the director was going for.Themes of insomnia are high on the bill and this surreal edge lends beautifully to the films tone.Its also cool to see the great Michael Ironside popping up again and the cast is well rounded off by Jennifer Jason Leigh.I watched the film expecting a great performance from Bale but i got so much more,the film is a clever,brooding little story that builds to a satisfying climax,one you will be mulling over long after the final credits have rolled.",8,4,6,8 June 2008
Saw III," Gorno gone mad, Saw III is a tedious exercise in splatter.
","I felt as though they were really pushing it with the 2nd film but this one is just daft.Its gorno fully realised.There is no substance,intrigue or tension anymore.Its clear to see that the film is a product of the success of the previous film and that there is no real inspiration.The film desperately wants to be a clever riddle that has you guessing to the last minute but the problem is most viewers will be long past caring when the inevitable final twist is unveiled.Add to the mess a series of unlikeable and distinctly churned out acting performances,MTV style direction clearly aimed at a younger demographic and you start to get the picture.I think this was the final straw for gorno in my book.Saw III and Hostel II particularly sold out and are not good films.",4,0,0,8 June 2008
No Strings Attached," Not very sexy. Not very funny. Kutcher is no leading man.
","We all have differing expectations of certain films, some people like the tabletop magazine, throwaway, take your brain out ease of watching a join the dots romantic comedy, some on the other hand , want to be moved and touched by what they see in a life affirming kind of way. Well, No Strings Attached definitely falls in to the 'take your brain out' category. The trailer sells it as a sexy and witty rom-com when in fact it is neither of those things. It is a dull, plodding experience with an obvious outcome and little inbetween. Sure it's stars are beautiful but do we care for these people, do they deserve or earn our respect and well wishes over the course of the film? Are we desperate for them to get together at the end? A world of no. Ashton Kutcher is no movie star, he is pretty and every inch the MTV presenter, but he cannot carry a film and such is his real life status, is virtually impossible to sympathise with. Natalie Portman on the other hand is a proved quality actress yet she can't help lift this out of the doldrums. Neither sexy or funny.",4,5,6,7 August 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Edgar Wright levels up with a real treat. Mega.
","Well that was an absolute blast!! From what i can gather, and this is without going and looking at box office figure, Scott Pilgrim was something of a flop. After having just sat through what was one of the most entertaining films i have seen in a good while, it's hard to see exactly why. Was the marketing strategy all wrong? Were people confused about what the film was. Whatever happened, i can for the life of me see how this isn't going to be one of those long term success stories. This film is so clever on so many levels. Levels is actually a key word here too. This film is all about getting to the next level, and the way in which Edgar Wright manages to squeeze every mega byte of gaming culture from the early days of the Atari, to the loading screens of Spectrums is just inspired. Even the Universal studios ident is given a Super Mario style sonic makeover at the beginning. This film is a real mash-up of cultures and styles (i was reminded of Quentin Tarantino) that really comes together in a very enjoyable way. As much fun as the direction from Wright is, the performances from the actors are all equally right on beat. A series of small but effective roles for the likes of Brandon Routh and Chris Evans really stand tall while all the central players, Cera, Winstead, Culkin come away with what should have been career enhancing credit. I don't really know how Scott Pilgrim is doing with it's life on DVD. I picked the film up for £4 in a supermarket, i didn't really have much in the way of expectation but boy, oh boy it blew my socks off. Congratulations to all, i hope the film earns the respect it so richly deserves over the course of time.",8,0,3,23 June 2012
Die Hard 2," A solid sequel
","Like the Lethal Weapon films of the late 80's and early 90's i found the Die Hard films to be very satisfying action entertainment.Much seems to be made of this sequel being inferior to its predecessor but i thought that it matched Die Hard for scale and has some breathtaking moments of action.Bruce Willis is still on top form as our hero and the airport setting during the busy Christmas period gives the film a positive buzz and a certain sense of hyperactivity.Although the film is missing a villain as much fun as Alan Rickmans Hans Gruber,William Sadler is nonetheless bad enough to hate and actually turns out a lot more ruthless than Gruber.In summary director Renny Harlin has succeeded in making a quick paced film that retains the sense of scale felt in the first film whilst making the most of Bruce Willis comic timing and action man charisma. 8/10",8,6,7,28 September 2008
No Country for Old Men," Great film, Bardem is spine chillingly good.Id have trimmed some of Tommy Lee Jones' scenes though.
","Of all the Coen brothers films i have happened across this has to be the one i found most entertaining.The Coen films tend to have an offbeat nature that will never appeal too the mass populace but i feel this is their most mainstream film.Javier Bardem is great in the central role,his performance is spine chillingly well delivered.If ever Arnold Scwarzenegger cant be on Terminator duty Javier has proved here that he is the man for the job.This film does actually share a lot in common with The Terminator.The thing i didn't particularly like about the film was Tommy Lee Jones scenes.I could see the relevance of his character but i struggled to grasp why some of his scenes went on as long as they did.They said nothing and only served to make the film feel uneven. Maybe thats what the Coens wanted,maybe they got the film into the editing suite and thought, this is way too mainstream , lets put some random scenes of pointless drifting dialogue to make it look different. Which ever way you slice it,most of Jones' scenes could and should have been trimmed. Otherwise this film is great and i encourage you to see it if not only for Javier Bardem.",9,1,1,18 February 2009
District 9," District 9 is one of the few times I've believed and cared about CG characters
","All eyes on Neill Bloekamp from now on for his film is an unmitigated triumph and a freshening breath of air in a world of Transformers and Terminators.I found myself actually caring, yes,caring for the CGI creations on display which is no mean feat considering the permanent scar of Jar Jar Binks on my movie loving brain.So,District 9 is an alien film set very firmly in a sense of reality well supported by a bookended documentary style. The film is accessible to the action genre with some outstanding set pieces but is also a film that will work on a higher intellectual level with its subtext being firmly placed on the wrongs of racial discrimination.What would be a shame is if the film spawns sequels and becomes a franchise as the thing it does very well is to say to the Michael Bays and McGs of this world , you can have great effects but you can also make a good film.",9,0,2,15 January 2010
Mamma Mia!," A bit like watching your grandma get drunk at a wedding trying to get it on with all the young men
","This film is the biggest UK box office success of all time. Forget Star Wars, forget Jaws, forget Titanic. This is the one. On that basis, i had to see for myself what all the fuss was for. I have to say i was amazed at how shoddy and painful this film was. It's a bit like watching your grandma drunk at a wedding trying to get it on with all the young men on the dancefloor. Im sure if you are female and fall in to the age category of 45-66 then you would find this film endearing but for everyone else its like pulling teeth. Even the music is badly reproduced and even though the actors sing in tune, they do nothing with the songs that makes you sit up and take notice. I was heavily disappointed with Mamma Mia,it felt forced and had nothing other than a great location to recommend it to anyone.",2,2,3,22 June 2009
Revolutionary Road," Tragic love story from American Beauty director Sam Mendes.
","Revolutionary Road is a tragic love story about two people who cant quite find a way to make things work.The film,which is adapted from a novel has so many layers of meaning yet is in its own essence,a very simple and straightforward story.Set against a 1950's backdrop and directed by Sam Mendes,Revolutionary Road is a deeply involving drama which re-unites Titanic stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Both stars deliver excellent performances truly bringing fully to life the characters and their contrasting plights. The suburban setting and score by Thomas Newman inevitably remind of Mendes' earlier film American Beauty.A similar kind of tragedy is explored here, as was explored in American Beauty.Mendes seems interested in peoples relationships and the painful dysfunctionality that can arise when two forces aren't pulling in the same direction within the confines of a family unit. Its great material and Mendes delivers a fine film,aided by a committed cast and some great on location camera work and production design.It doesn't indulge comedy like American Beauty but its more than a match in the dramatic stakes. 9/10",9,0,0,16 November 2009
28 Days Later...," 10 years later...
","Ten years later and Danny Boyle's lo-fi post apocalyptic horror plays as a mixed bag of success' and failures. Filmed on digital video cameras, the film has a raw quality that compliments the visceral tone stated strongly from the offset. Almost creating a zombie sub-genre of it's own, '28 Days' tips it's cap to George Romero (a shopping scene) and most strikingly, Day Of The Triffids. It's simple stuff, a virus breaks out that's transmitted via blood and saliva which causes it's hosts to become blood curdling zombies on speed. We see the world through the eyes of Jim (Cillian Muprhy) who after having recently woken from a coma, stumbles across an iconic London landscape bereft of human life. If there's a money shot, then this is it. It's a haunting sight that sets the film off with some strikingly memorable imagery. Like any film akin to the zombie genre, what follows is a tale of survival against everything and everyone. 28 Days is at it's best when exploring the world left behind but sadly falls short on character development. Brendan Gleeson's warmth is a welcome and likable addition, but Naomie Harris and Cillian Murphy aren't able to muster much, while Megan Burns playing the teen child of the group is career-endingly awful. What's most disappointing is the third act which starts promisingly but becomes all too formulaic and feels rushed and tacked on. Attempts to develop a love story between Jim and Seline (Harris) fall flat and in the end there is a feeling that style has overpowered substance.",7,2,3,14 August 2012
2012," Roland Emmerichs 2012 is about as unimaginative as a film can get.
","I agree with critic Mark Kermode. This film was written by accountants. Its the only explanation for the sheer tripe that we are presented with.I wont bore you with the setup,but needless to say,the world is on the eve of destruction from within.The film plods through all the clichés as our main characters go through the motions in a painfully uninteresting way.The CGI destruction of the world offers no threat or tension,it just happens in a really non emotional and tedious way.At no point in the film did i marvel or sit in awe of the spectacle of it all.Instead,i winced at the 2 hours and 40 mins running time and willed the movie to its predictable and boring climax.Some good actors do very little than pick up the paycheque,only Oliver Platt seems to want to have a go at having fun but alas,its all in vain.The film is terrible and Roland Emmerich does nothing to divorce himself from having a reputation for making terribly bloated and over sentimentalised garbage.",2,6,8,11 April 2010
Kick-Ass," Avoids 'movie' cliché at every turn yet riffs beautifully on those within the context of the superhero genre
","Kick-Ass wastes no time in establishing itself as a superhero comedy film with a clear and precise intention of what it is.The opening scene sets the tone for one of the most daring,funny,exhilarating and downright funny experiences you will ever have watching a film. The script is witty and knowing and while the film dodges 'movie' clichés at every turn,it does a great job of embracing and riffing on clichés within the context of the superhero genre.The idea of the superhero vigilante has been done to death with Batman and Watchmen in recent years,but neither of those films manage to come close to being nearly half as fun as Kick-Ass.Remember films like My Super Ex Girlfriend? Well forget them now, this is how to have fun with superheroes. Another interesting success within Kick Ass is that it knows the world can be an evil place and it doesn't shy away from the darkness. There are tough scenes within this film,but levity is never trailing too far behind. The last word must go to Hit Girl. I have never seen a film in which i have come away feeling as thought the 11 year old girl was the coolest thing on screen. I have now. 10/10",10,1,6,24 October 2010
Unknown," Highly functional thriller with a 'Frantic' feel.
","While i'd hardly leap out of my seat to see much of Jaume Collet-Serra's back catalogue (Goal II, House Of Wax remake), i have to say he has turned in a highly functional, and always engaging modern day thriller with 'Unknown'. Liam Neeson seems to now find himself at home as the '50 something' action hero, and his performance is suitably 'Frantic' which is another film that springs immediately to mind in the early stages. Neeson is supported well by an impressive cast featuring Diane Kruger,January Jones and two heavyweight actors in the shape of Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. While you never quite feel the goosebumps brought on by 'Taken', there's still enough thrills,spills and twists to fill up the running time, and things never at any point drag.",7,2,3,28 December 2011
Moulin Rouge!," Bombastic fun.
","Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of Moulin Rouge, and cinema's fourth visit, is a boisterous musical journey into the famed seedy underworld of early 2oth century Paris. Visually arresting and with more energy than Tom Cruise on speed, Luhrmann's film strikes a rare balance of appearing to be on the brink of losing control while remaining sharply focused and fully on key. For a cast with no track record in musicals, there's an inherent 'holding of breath' before each characters melodic introduction and although it's clear that neither Kidman of McGregor are ever going to win awards for vocal prowess, their commitment and respective charms are more than enough to keep the central love story alive while allowing us to marvel at the stunning musical arrangements that cover a colourful medley of everything from Rogers and Hammerstein to Nirvana. Beyond all the razzamatazz and histrionics there lies a central love story. That such a thing as true love could exist in a world fuelled by exploitation and sex is an excellent jumping off point for the story of Christian (Ewan Mcgregor) who as a writer, has come to Paris to capture a flavour of the infectious bohemian spirit perpetuated at the lively Moulin Rouge. It's there that Christian encounters Satine (Nicole Kidman) who as the nightclub's most coveted attraction embodies all the traits of the tortured starlet. Satine is beautiful and talented, but her ambition to attain fame beyond the confines of 'the rouge' means selling herself to the extent of sacrificing personal happiness in favour of stardom. Christians naivety and innocence is attractive to Satine and his ability to break through the illusion and lies of her world begin to entice her away from the things she has always strived for. Circling like a predator is 'The Duke' (Richard Roxburgh) who forms the third part of a dangerous love triangle. The Duke is a powerful man with the means to provide Satine with her big break, but only for the price of her affections which gives way to an emotional tug-of-war played out through a series of perfectly bombastic song and dance numbers. At times it becomes a game of name that tune as one infectious melody merges into another. One number that threatens to steal the show is Jim Broadbent's 'Like A Virgin', which is so over the top in delivery that it's hard to deny a constant smile. Indeed, for much of the runtime, the film aims to captivate and arouse that sense of cheeky, nod-nod-wink-wink humour in way that's never overly salacious and falls on the right side of good taste. In summary, a good old fashioned story of love set against a decadent backdrop and told with an agreeably trippy verve with likable performances.",8,1,2,14 August 2012
Back to the Future Part III," Fun in parts but its clear to see they were running out of steam.
","Such is my affection for the Back To The Future movies,that i struggle to write this review but there is no getting away from the feeling that this is by far the weakest entry of the franchise.The things about the film that are good are the central performances from Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd who continue their excellent chemistry and energy. As with the previous Back To The Future sequel this movie plays on and repeats gags from the previous movies to great effect while also paying homage to popular culture with many references. The old west setting is fun at first but never as much fun as the journeys between 1955 and 1985 when Marty McFly interacts with his parents at his age. Mary Steenburgen is introduced as a love interest for Christopher Lloyds Doc Brown which only serves to stall the film and while some might like the love story element, its hard to properly fit it in to a film of this kind when the story strands are all being tied up and in the end it feels terribly perfunctory.",7,1,3,11 February 2011
Donnie Brasco," If you know your Godfathers and Goodfellas, you'll like this.
","If you are genned up on your Godafathers and Goodfellas, you'll feel on familiar territory with Mike Newell's 'Donnie Brasco'. Based on true events, and indeed the book of Joseph Pistone, our lead character, the film is a very good gangster story that not only examines the life of a 'wiseguy' but also explores the futility and once again, the ultimate destruction and downfall that seems to befall everyone who signs up to the life. Al Pacino is truly great as 'Lefty', so much so, that it's hard not to feel compassion for his character, before remembering, 'this guy is a murderous sociopath'. Johnny Depp is good as Pistone, and there are moments of real tension between the two main characters. Ultimately, this film is about betrayal, friendship and what really matters in life. Depps 'Pistone' gives up everything he loves for the job, and when he looks back, he has to ask himself, 'Was it all worth it?'",8,0,0,4 January 2012
Clash of the Titans," With $493m in box office takings, Cash of the Titans might be a more appropriate title.
","Based on the 1981 film of the same name, Clash of the Titans is a big budget CGI-fest that aims to dazzle the senses with it's busy action sequences and sprawling scopes. With a heavyweight cast and a dizzying $125m budget, director Louis Letterier has created what is essentially a rushed looking collection of overblown set pieces assembled around chunks of dull exposition. This is the story of demigod Perseus, played by Sam Worthington, and his quest to fight as a man, for man against the vengeful Gods of Olympus who are royally 'cheesed off' because some soldiers took it upon themselves to knock down a big statue of Zeus – Liam Neeson no less. So, fresh from the 'underworld', up pops big bad God Hades (Ralph Fiennes), embracing his inner Voldermort, to teach mankind a lesson. Frankly, why Zeus would ever set a God with blatant mental health issues loose on a species he claims to love is never fleshed out, but then again, this isn't a film that invests much time fleshing much of anything out. Instead, it's far more concerned with getting some of that $125m budget and shoving it in your face. And so it does. Along the ahem, 'epic' quest (presented via a series of sweeping CG exteriors), we encounter all manner of CG behemoths, none of which are animated with any convincing real world heft. The Medusa part of the story, the chapter i always found to be the most riveting and frightening as a child, sacrifices any genuine creepiness by being a noisy and action heavy overload of computer generated disappointment, which all but sums up the film. Sam Worthington fails to inject any personality into Perseus, Gemma Arterton looks pale faced and pretty while Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes most likely pick up a decent payday in exchange for a bit of hammy overdoing it. When the inevitable conclusion finally comes, it's a welcome relief. With it's swordplay and excitable action, the film may function satisfactorily for an early teen audience, but for most it's sorely lacking in many areas, most crucially character and script. Despite much derision aimed at it's eleventh hour retro-fitted 3D release, the film turned over an almighty $493.2m in global box office although if you've seen the spoiler heavy trailer first, you've pretty much seen the whole thing. Cash of the Titans might have been a more appropriate title.",5,2,2,31 July 2012
The Dark Knight," Brutal and brilliant.Christopher Nolan has somehow managed to out do himself.
","It hard to summarise The Dark Knight in such a short space as it is a complex film deserving of a thorough dissection.The film is brilliant in more or less every way.From the acting to the art direction,the film lives and breathes inspiration from all the creative forces surrounding it.Its sad that the films brightest shining light,Heath Ledger as the psychotic Joker,isn't around to receive the plaudits he deserved from such a committed and beautifully crafted take.Chris Nolan could quite easily retire a legend if he continues the standard set in this film for his future projects.He squeezes every ounce from the budget to bring us the finest Batman film to date and a mighty fine crime thriller to boot.The film has caused controversy in my country for its certification (12A).There is no denying,this is not a film for children,its themes are completely unsuitable and story too complex and dark for younger viewers.Lets say,this is an adult comic book film a million miles from the Kerpow and Shazzam of Adam West and Burt Ward. 10/10",9,2,8,26 September 2008

","Into The Wild is an inspiring and deeply moving film.Going into this film i had no idea it was based on reality and as the credits rolled i sat there motionless and collected my thoughts. Sean Penn has crafted a beautiful film that is a great tribute to the young man at the centre of its story.Chris touches everybody he meets, he uplifts everybody he meets and enriches their lives with his view on life. This film has a strong and good heart running through it and i cannot recommend it highly enough.The films setting is awe inspiring and breath taking and by the end of the film you genuinely feel as though you've been on an epic journey of discovery with this young man. See this film if you can, it will make you think and pull you closer to those you love. Outstanding piece.",8,1,3,17 February 2009
The World's Fastest Indian," Inspirational and touching,Hopkins is outstanding
","This is a film that not a lot of people will see but those who have will be all the better for it.Anthony Hopkins delivers an outstanding performance in a touching and funny film that engages the heart and enriches the soul.Hopkins performance is central to the enjoyment of the film,his character is wonderfully naive,his dogged determination and vision to achieve his goal is truly inspirational.I challenge anyone to not get sucked into his performance and root for his character in much the same way we all rooted for Rocky in 1975 when everyone was against him.The films title wont grab anyones attention, there's no digital effects and no all star cast but with a story as good as this you just don't need the distraction of star names.This is the most unexpected fun I've had watching a film in a long long time.I would urge anyone who is feeling a bit down to give this film a chance as it is a life affirming piece that will have you feeling good and bring a smile to your face. Beautiful film full of heart.10/10",10,2,2,7 June 2008
Avatar," 3D id finally born.Unfortunately, we'll now see a lot of directors making 3D films that don't measure up to Avatar.
","I think i need to review this film again when i can relax and immerse in the experience. The showing i went to was spoiled by two brats who insisted on doing a running commentary during most of the picture which was a huge shame.That aside i really did get the feeling that James Cameron has achieved something major here. His use of technology never seems to get in the way of him making a good film like it does with the Emmerichs and Bays of this world. Cameron has proved that no-one does epic like him. He was almost born to be a popcorn director yet he is so much more at the same time. The story of Avatar is very simple and the plot has obvious comparisons to Dances With Wolves and more recently The Last Samurai. This would probably be more of a drag if the film itself wasn't such a visual knockout, yes, the film is alive, the visuals are truly stunning and the imagination that has gone in to creating this world and these surroundings is remarkable. The cast are all fine, Stephen Lang is fun the cartoonish baddie although it would have been better if we as an audience could have hated him a little more. Sam Worthington continues to grow and is OK as Jake. Sigourney Weaver is always a presence but here she is given a lot less to do than as Ripley in Aliens. In all, i thought Avatar was a resounding success in as much as its visual achievements. The only downside? Every two-bit director in Hollywood will now be making 3D films. A lot of them will be rubbish and few will pass the test in same way Avatar has.",8,5,9,20 January 2010
Super 8," Familiarity bred contempt.
","Being a fan of Steven Spielberg's 70's films like Jaws and Close Encounters makes me a pretty hard to please fan of the blockbuster. So when JJ Abrams comes along with his clever marketing schemes and pitches a new film that looks and sounds like one of Stevens early ones, my defences are cautiously lowered. Unwise of me. I found Super 8 to be forced and tiresome. Those of us who rode the crazy wave of the first blockbusters in the late 70's and early 80's know exactly how they felt and don't need some jumped up Spielberg wannabe regurgitating them up. That's exactly what JJ tries, but somehow it comes off as being the same, but not as good. Just like McG did with Terminator Salavation. Film makers inspired by other great film makers trying their hardest to replicate the work. It's kind of the ultimate tribute, but it's also just a little bit boring for those of us wanting to feel like were being taken on an adventure, not being reminded constantly of better films.",6,3,4,13 May 2012
Up," My hardened heart has been thawed by the sheer joy and creation on display.
","In the years since Toy Story burst onto our screens,i have grown a little weary of the cute digimations that have flooded our screens. More than most seemed to feature some sarcastic little animal,voiced by an irritating overpaid recognisable actor picking up and easy paycheck. So, with trepidation i inserted Up in to my DVD machine and after 10minutes i realised i was watching something as imaginative as it was visually impressive. I never gave a second thought to who was voicing who.To my delight, i just let myself be carried away with the film and at the end i found myself having choked back the tears at least 5 times. Wow. I never thought a digimation could do that to me but it did. My hardened heart has been thawed by the sheer joy and creation on display in Pixars Up. A truly remarkable film done with love and passion that deserves all the plaudits and all the stars in all the magazines and review shows around the world. Perfection.",10,3,6,15 July 2010
Zombieland," Any fans of Romero's 'Of The Deads' or Edgar Wrights 'Shaun' are in for a good time
","As an audience member, to get the most out of Zombieland, there has to be a certain amount of surrendering to the material. Anyone familiar with George A Romero's 'Of The Deads', or Edgar Wrights 'Shaun' should breeze through all 88mins with a permanent smile. That said, i wouldn't go as far as to conclude that 'Z-Land' is purely for the schooled flesh- eating aficionados among us. Like it's UK counterpart, 'Shaun', this is top notch silliness played for laughs first, with gore and splatter for seconds. Like the zombies, the jokes come thick and fast. Eisenberg and Harrelson make an unlikely, but highly likable screen duo while Emma Stone adds a dry, sexy charm. If there's a weak link amongst all this fun, it's Abigail Breslin's 'tougher than the guys' 12yr old character who serves as nothing more than filler and soon becomes irritating. The writing by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick is razor sharp and although the zombie film is a worn formula, there's enough clever ideas and humour injected into recognising the personality clashes within our central group of characters to make Zombieland feel like a fresh take on the genre. It goes without saying, but probably shouldn't that the make-up and special effects are also a joy to behold and the tight running time assures that the film seldom sags. One last nod must go to a very special cameo. For anyone who hasn't seen the film, i won't spoil it here, but it's a treat and yet another fun ingredient to add to what is a joyous, efficient and likable film watching experience which while not quite measuring up to Edgar Wright's similarly themed zom-com effort, comes a very, very close second best. And that's saying something. 3.5/5",8,0,2,22 July 2012
War of the Worlds," A hell of a lot better than many people say it is.
","When the director of Jaws and Raiders Of The Lost Ark announces he's going to make an alien invasion film, there comes attached a certain buzz of excitement. For my money, Steven Spielberg is at his most effective as a film-maker when the subject matter is, for want a better expression, cheaper. That's not taking anything away from the likes of Saving Private Ryan, but it's hard to think of anyone who entertains so wildly, yet humanises what should be throwaway, low rent material. It's true testament to his talent that a film about a giant fish terrorising a beach community endures to be celebrated and revered as much today as it has ever been. So on to War of The Worlds, Spielberg's stab at reviving H.G Wells' seminal classic thriller. Modern day alien invasion films have screened the end of the world as a global catastrophe with vast military presence, presidents ordering 'Go to DEFCON4″ , and an abundance of CGI critters. What we have here, and in keeping with the Spielberg style, is a more personal account of the invasion as told through the eyes of Tom Cruise's 'Ray Ferrier' as he and his two children flee the alien apocalypse. This keyhole view of the invasion is a daring but highly effective move. At times, we glimpse the unfolding disaster in the background as it envelops everything behind our escaping protagonists. That's not to say that there's aren't jaw dropping full on CGI moments, but these are done sparingly and without ever feeling like something's being jammed into your face until you submit (Transformers anyone?). Spielberg also understands the threat and suspense created by implication, as opposed to full on exposure. When it comes to use of sound, as with Jaws, Spielberg proved how much you can heighten that sense of impending danger with a few notes. In War Of The Worlds, the alien invaders have machines that omit a low sonic boom that immediately sends shivers down the spine and recalls the ominous sound of the air raid siren used during World War II. It's another master stroke, a simple idea executed for maximum impact. Jumping and leaping around like an energiser bunny, Tom Cruise brings great verve to the film and instead of playing the all American hero, his character is presented as a failing father who's relationship with his children borders on mutual apathy. Once all hell breaks loose, that dysfunction allows the film a pleasing dramatic scope which helps drive the film forward on two fronts. If i have any criticism, it'd be that the film isn't long enough. In some ways that's a back handed compliment, such was my enjoyment that i was disappointed when the end came so abruptly. All things considered though, another fine addition to an impressive catalogue of films from the true king of the summer blockbuster. 4/5",9,3,5,27 July 2012
Jaws," Bruce almighty. Give me a mechanical shark over CGI any day.
","Much has been made over the years since Jaws first took the world by storm of the overall naffness of the mechanical shark, a.k.a Bruce. Watching it back in the year 2012, nearly forty years since it's release, it's amazing how good it actually looks. In a world overrun by computer generated jiggery pokery, seeing the raw ambition and physicality of an actual on location effect is an infinitely more rewarding experience than seeing some weightless digital manipulation which is an all too present feature of many modern mainstream blockbusters. Jaws is and always was far more than just a film about a giant shark terrorising a vibrant beach community. Based on Peter Benchley's bestseller, it owes a huge debt to Hitchcock in the way it implies threat and employs clever camera techniques to heighten tension. In collaboration with Benchley, Carl Gottlieb's superb screenplay is fleshed out beautifully with great performances including some wonderfully improvised moments that ground the film and give it surprising humanity. Richard Shaw's 'Quint', the stubborn old sea dog, Richard Dreyfuss' 'Hooper', the nerdy enthusiastic science puppy and Roy Scheider's 'Brody', the slightly neurotic worrier create a hugely likable trio that in the second half of the film come into their own in the hunt for the monster. A Jaws review without mention of John Williams' genius musical score is not a proper review. As with many other celebrated classics, Williams' music is the star of the film. With a few simple notes, Williams created something truly iconic that lives strong today in the vast subconsciousness of the world. I have nothing negative to say about Jaws, it still shocks, it still surprises and it'll forever be a classic piece of cinema from a talented director with the ability to use his influences to create his own brand of magic.",10,6,11,14 August 2012
The Wrestler," If you believe in destiny,this film was waiting for Mickey Rourke
","After all the excess,the burnt bridges,the abuse and the failed relationships this is the film that has been waiting for Mickey Rourke. If you believe in destiny, then this film was made and written to star Mickey Rourke and no-one else. Mickeys life more or less mirrors his characters life on screen and having heard various interviews with Rourke its interesting to hear that he in fact adapted parts of the script to fit situations in his own life.The Wrestler is a great achievement for its star and director Darren Aranofsky.It also features in my opinion,a career best performance from Marisa Tomei as a strip dancer. (Tomei won an academy award for My Cousin Vinny but is far better here).Apart from the immense physical performance from Rourke,he also gives a very touching and moving acting performance,finally delivering on all that promise he showed at the start of his career. The Wrestler is a fine figure of a film. Its a film that men and women can enjoy alike and crowns a triumphant comeback for its star Mickey Rourke. 8/10",10,0,0,15 November 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best prequel is still light years behind the originals.
","The best of the new Star Wars prequels is still light years away from the quality of the original movies. It's easier to examine the good things so i'll begin by saying Ian McDiarmid is superb as Emperor Palpatine. His character has real purpose and its something the prequels had lacked up until now. The general feeling still exists that is that big set pieces get in the way of telling a very important story. Before this film, audiences have had to endure Podraces, Jar Jar, droid factories, flying R2's and CG overload. What they really needed from this film,and this is something the original trilogy had in spades,was storytelling but instead we get a whole subplot where Obi Wan is chasing after some CGI robot with four lightsabres while riding some annoying sounding CGI animal and you just want to yell STOP!!!!! The developments between Anakin and Palpatine are interesting though, and McDiarmid recalls the same hammy brilliance seen in Return Of The Jedi. Hayden Christensen is still out of his depth as Anakin however and lacks the dramatic skill to really convey true menace. Another deeply disappointing moment comes when a suited and booted Vader is finally allowed to speak for the first time. There is a moment so embarrassing, it almost devalues the character forever. Nooooooooooooooooooo, he wails in the most unintentionally funny moment of the movie. So do we.",7,2,4,25 January 2011
Back to the Future Part II," The McFly family ties get even more complex in this well imagined sequel
","Upon revisiting Back To The Future Part II recently,it occurred to me that i have spent years thinking what a highly inferior sequel it was but having now seen it through new eyes, im happy to say that i feel as though i have been very harsh in holding that opinion for so long. Yes, there is only one first time with these things and the beauty of the first adventure was that we got to see Marty McFly interact with his parents when they were his age and the sheer brilliance of that idea was always going to be difficult for the creative minds behind this sequel to top. What they have come up with is a smart,complex weaving of overlapping time frames that keeps you as a viewer on your feet while riffing on many of the ideas from the first film. The trip in to the future is a sheer joy as we see 2015 (four years away), and the imagination and wit that has gone in to creating a not so distant future vision. The 'mcguffin' on this occasion, a future sports results book that falls in to the wrong hands and goes back to 1955, doesn't evoke the same fun as the McFly family ties, but the journey is one well worth taking and in the end you have to surrender to the energy and fun of this very well imagined and thought out sequel. It's a shame the excellent Crispin Glover doesn't return as George McFly but the rest of the cast all live up to previous performances and Zemeckis handles the complex structure with enviable skill.",9,1,2,8 February 2011
The Silence of the Lambs," Possibly the best film of the 90's?
","Looking back at the 90's,some of the best films I saw in that era were very dark and sinister films that tapped into our fear factor and while compelling us also terrified us.Silence Of The Lambs and Se7en were both mainstream pictures that held aloft a very bleak vision but managed to garner massive public appeal as well as critical acclaim.Lambs will be best remembered for the scintillating performance provided by Anthony Hopkins but there really is a lot more to it than that.The film is alive with evil,it is a sinister and deeply disturbing film that gets under the skin, quite literally, and keeps the tension wound tight until the final act.Jodie Foster is brilliant as Clarice Starling displaying vulnerability and balls in equal measure, the follow up film should have never been made without her.Director Jonathan Demme didn't go on to make a film anywhere near as compelling as this,sure the film is driven by Hopkins' performance but Demme also gets the best out of Ted Levine and Foster as well managing to maintain the tension to tremendous effect throughout.In summary Silence Of The Lambs is a brilliant book to film adaptation that encapsulates everything that was great about the book and builds upon it. 10/10",10,4,8,18 June 2008
X-Men: First Class," Another franchise reboot....but this one's good.
","After three X-Men films and a pretty poor origins story attempt for Wolverine in a film of the same name, i might be forgiven for feeling a little underwhelmed by the prospect of sitting down for over two hours and watching another reboot of a popular comic book franchise. Turns out, contrary to my expectations, i had a great time. This is an origins story that attempts to entertain you rather than bog you down with exposition. The film is surprisingly light on it's feet and has many fun action set pieces as well as some eye catching sets and sexy performances. Michael Fassbender shines for the good guys as Magneto while Kevin Bacon seems to be having the best time of his career in his role as a bad guy. My only disappointment was the performance of James McAvoy, i found his character hard to believe and more importantly, hard to like. Something just seemed a little forced. Full credit must go to Matthew Vaughn for pulling this off. I was a huge fan of Kick Ass and if it weren't for how much i loved that film, i may never have tried this. I'm glad i did.",8,1,1,16 May 2012
Iron Man," Great entertainment
",Iron Man is a great night out.Robert Downey JNR delivers a fun packed cocksure performance that will have you laughing out loud on a few occasions.Fans of the comic book must be delighted with his interpretation of Tony Stark. He truly brings the character to life and provides us with of the best comic book to film translations in memory.The visual effects are also outstanding and the film is very cleverly directed.The film goes a little 'Transformers' towards the end but on the whole it is a thrilling ride and has set the bar at a high level for the rest of the summer blockbusters to try and beat. Great stuff.,8,1,2,14 May 2008
Before Sunrise," Irresistibly romantic.
","What a breath of fresh air. Watching this film makes me wonder why i put myself through watching so many empty, soulless blockbusters. Watching Before Sunrise is a great experience. You feel for the characters, you understand their awkwardness,their joy and their discovery. It's so familiar to so many of us, you also feel their pain and their melancholy toward the end and ultimately, its irresistibly romantic. From a story or narrative point of view, there is nothing, this is all about the human beings in the film and it's all the better for it. Credit must go to Richard Linkater for his unfussy direction, that just allows to film to breathe,unwind and gradually stretch it's legs. I loved Before Sunrise, and i can't wait to catch up with the characters nine years later in the 2004 sequel, Before Sunset.",9,5,8,2 December 2011
Live Free or Die Hard," Retains the sense of scale and humour of the earlier entries.A good sign off for the series.
","The Die Hard films have always had a great vibe about them.There is always a wonderful sense of scale and a great blend of humour and I'm glad to say both are still evident in this fourth outing in the series.Bruce Willis still looks the part as John McClane,age certainly hasn't slowed him down and he cracks as wise as ever.The slight let down with this entry is Timothy Olyphant as the main villain.Hes about as threatening an sinister as David Attenborough,yes,not very.Maggie Q however,as his kung-fu kicking partner in crime is great to watch and the set piece face off between her and McClain is one of the films high points.Die Hard 4.0 isn't the best of the series but it holds its own against part three in my book and continues the series respectably.Willis' action man days may be numbered but if this is his sign off for the Die Hard series then he has gone out on a high. 8/10",8,0,1,14 October 2008
The Matrix," 11 years on and still one of the best science fiction fantasy films out there.
","It's easy,after the mess that was Reloaded and Revolutions to forget that The Matrix is one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. Just like Lucas tarnished the image of his Star Wars films with the lesser Menace,Clones and Sith, the Wachowski Brothers were quick to make a buck and dragged the good name of The Matrix through similar mud. I caught a segment of the film on television last night and it reminded me what an engaging,well thought out and intelligent film it is. It also reminded me that it did not require a sequel. The story was told and wrapped up. Neo had realised his abilities and there were no new areas to explore. Of course, people will argue that we don't see Zion and of course,that would be the natural course of a sequel but in terms of character and story, the tale was told. While also being high on concept, The Matrix also delivered in terms of narrative. The film is multi layered. You can watch it for the straight up action fun,or you can also find something rarther more deep and philosophical if the need takes you. It's a big budget blockbuster with brains and it's with a certain regret, that i had kind of forgotten that.",10,0,1,13 August 2010
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A cultural phenomenon that transcends the silver screen to become the most loved and talked about film that you will ever watch.
","Star Wars is the complete cinema experience.Age has not weathered it and the message of good vs evil still stands stronger than ever in these darkened modern times.Its hard to just see Star Wars as a film,it has changed and enriched so many lives throughout the world that it seems to be doing it a disservice by simply calling it a film.We all have our memories of first seeing it and i wont bore you with mine here but needless to say i love it today as i loved it as a child.Every cinema experience i have had since seeing Star Wars seems to be subliminally judged against.Looking back at it now the action is excellent, the music is masterful,the effects are inventive,fearless and a rival to anything produced on CGI,the actors are a joy and the film seems to have a free spirit.It was made before the weight of expectation and the internet and it will be forever burned into the public consciousness as the defining moment of cinema.",10,0,0,3 June 2008
Fantastic Four," Good but not great.A little overcooked on the comedy side and a little light on action. Decent attempt however.
","Although i quite enjoyed the tone of Fantastic Four and found myself more entertained than most led me to believe i would be i still got a nagging feeling that an opportunity had been missed here.The foursome are all great fun in their roles,Jessica Alba looks stunning as Sue Storm and Chris Evans is a bolt of energy as Torch.The problem is a lack of action and just a little too much comedy.That said, when the action does kick in , its whizz bang stuff with some impressive CGI,just a pity there wasn't a bit more.Im not sure if the film could have actually been made much better than it was.Its a tough ask to make a film about multiple super heroes.Bryan Singer did a great job of it with his X-Men films but those levels of entertainment are not quite realised here.A fun film but slightly short of the the quality expected.",7,2,3,9 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," If you thought Star Wars was a tough act to follow, spare a thought for Richard Marquand.
","It's hard to think of Empire as merely a film.To me,it represents more than that.In a way,i wish i could watch it again through new eyes and experience it without knowing the next piece of dialogue seconds before it's uttered.When you think this way about a film,it means you love it more than you ought to.This is true of mine and Empire Strikes Backs relationship.I saw it as a child and all the deep and meaningful stuff was lost on me but i recognised that i was sad when Han was taken away. Years later,the power of the film hit me and made me understand that, not only was this film amazing to look at,it covered almost every base technically. Looking at the Star Wars 'franchise' (hate that word) as it stands now, this is the film that made the life and longevity of the thing possible. Empire is truly the best of the Star Wars films and a strong contender for best sequel ever made. It's a film about relationships and growing and learning who you are. It's about finding your place in the world/galaxy and understanding how your impulses,as strong as they are sometimes, are not always the path to progression and betterment. I understand Empires power now, it's a film that teaches if you let it. Its also an amazing spectacle of the imagination that furthers something that was already brilliant and groundbreaking. If you thought Star Wars was a tough act to follow, spare a thought for Richard Marquand, director of Return Of The Jedi.",10,0,1,10 August 2010
Moon," Moon is outstanding.
","I love Moon!! Yes, at last we have a science fiction film that isn't all about sfx and visual fireworks. This is a brainy scifi flick that will leave a lasting impression. The director of the film was very much influenced by Alien and Blade Runner,you can see it in the production design which is toweringly immense. Sam Rockwell plays the part of a man stationed on the moon for a 3 year contract. We join him in the final two weeks of his stay and witness some pretty odd goings on. Kevin Spacey voices the computer in the film which will have done wonders for the promoters but i think this is the only drawback. In films like these, you don't need stars, we don't need to be reminded of Lester Burnham or John Doe from Se7en but its a small gripe in an otherwise tremendous film that is a joy to behold from start to finish. Moon is well worth paying for.",9,0,1,19 November 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," The set up drags a little but the pay off in the final act makes it all worthwhile
","A late comer to Slumdog ,i realised from the start i was watching a film that people loved and that i ought to love too.I was surprised to find myself tempted to stop the whole thing about 40mins in,as i found the set-up to the the inevitable conclusion to be a little tedious.That said, i stuck with the film and ended up coming away impressed. The last third of the film is the most engaging as we step into uncharted territory. The first two acts are basic set and explanation as to how we got to where we are,which i found more than a little tiring. The cast are all excellent though. The young actors in the film are a delight but be warned,the film features some surprisingly unpleasant moments. It had been billed as the 'feel good movie of the year' and it is 'feel good' although it seems that tag doesn't quite sit right. It is feel good in the same way that Shawshank is,our characters have to climb through the mud to get to the good stuff. We join them on that journey and the central love story of the film, which is in essence, what the film is, drives home the last third with an undeniably satisfying and quite joyful conclusion. Just stick with it if you find yourself wavering because the pay off is worth it.",8,0,6,8 December 2009
Back to the Future," A sci-fi blockbuster light on sfx and full of character and plot.
","Robert Zemeckis' Back To The Future is a highly entertaining, well imagined classic of a blockbuster. The 80's spawned a rich variety of franchise films and the Back To The Future series can be considered one of the better ones. Central to the success of the film are the performances, this is a science fiction blockbuster relatively light on special effects and more concerned with character and plot. All the actors are great, Lloyd and Fox of course,but praise must also go to Crispin Glover who plays his wet blanketed nerd with a heart role to perfection. The script is sharp and the production design is outstanding with a picture postcard image of the 1950's well realised and the Deloreon time machine a great touch. Zemeckis' last film Romance In The Stone proved how well he could handle entertaining popcorn movies and he succeeds beyond expectation here with a highly energised, fun packed time travelling adventure to remember.",10,1,1,5 February 2011
