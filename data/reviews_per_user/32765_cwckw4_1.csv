United 93," what an unbelievable powerful movie
","this movie was so amazing. From beginning to end, it had me on the edge of my seat and i knew what would happen. it felt so real, not because it has happened, but because it was as it was happening at that very moment. this unbelievable sad day was presented so beautifully in this point of view (flight 93). it captured what that whole situation would actually be like. no big actors, no heroes, no bad acting - just plain real people in a very real situation. it was so powerful. what an amazing ending also - it ended exactly as it should have, leaving the theatre in dead silence for 5 minutes after it ended. I want to see this again so badly, but being so sad and so intense and powerful, i simply cannot.",10,0,3,16 May 2006
