Deja Vu," once again Denzel Washington proves his stunning talent.....
","as a big fan of Denzel Washingtons movies, he proved from this film that he is one of the best actors i've ever seen. amazing film, great performance, unbelievable visual effects and pictures, excellent directing...... simply Wonderful movie.Usually i'm a bit talker in cinema theatre ( where i got my ass kicked many times lol ) but in this film i was very quiet and focused on the movie, didn't want to miss any second of the movie cause u'll see how the scenes r connected to each other, where every little mysterious thing will get explained later on.Bravo Denzel Washington, u never disappoint me. Go and see this movie, u wont regret it. 9.9/10",10,0,1,20 December 2006
