Requiem for a Dream," If there were only eleven stars to give...
","1000 words cannot describe the feelings I experienced during this movie and immediately after. Parts of this movie made my stomach turn and my heart break. The climax of this movie is one that people will never forget, not only because it completely blows one's mind away, but because it is in fact impossible to do so. I strongly advise that anyone who watches this movie must be mature enough to do so, because the cruel reality of drugs and its effects on the lives of people in this film were something that even I ,an adult, was not fully prepared for. Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, and Ellen Burstyn put on amazing performances that in my opinion are almost impossible for them to top. The cinematography, screenplay, and the portrayal of what life is like when one depends on drugs could not have been done better. Hubert Selby Jr. did a great job by choosing an independent film company to bring his novel to the big screen. This movie has no flaws, and in fact only holds a promise that you will never forget this film.",10,2,4,10 April 2008
