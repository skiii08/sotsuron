Mission: Impossible III," Crap, but fun.
","Tom Cruise's latest adventure doesn't break any boundaries, nor does it create any new ones. But who actually gives a damn? 'Mission Impossible 3' is set to be this summer's major blockbuster (until 'Pirates of the Caribbean 2' sails its way onto our screens, at least) and there's absolutely no reason why the film shouldn't enjoy blockbuster success.The brains behind the latest IMF instalment is J.J. Abrams, the creator of ever-popular American TV series' 'Lost' and 'Alias.' Although his directing fails to deliver in places, M:I-3 has all the hallmarks of a classic action adventure - high octane action, blistering special effects, and less plot than an Asda advertisement.The film consists of four main action sequences, loosely strung together with the knowledge that our hero Ethan Hunt (a weak combination of James Bond and Jack Bauer) has to save his wife, Julia.It's a crap excuse to see Tom Cruise run around trying to find, and eventually defeat, the latest villain, Owen Davian, played by the excellent Philip Seymour Hoffman.A strong supporting cast helps solidify the non-existent plot line, whilst Cruise plays his character with more cheese than ever.You can certainly match the similarities between J.J. Abrams 'Lost' and 'Alias', with even field agent code names matching that of 'Alias'.Thrown in for good measure are visits to exotic locations, such as China and the Vatican in Rome, but at the end of the day it is good old fashioned action that stops Mission Impossible 3 from flopping.",7,0,2,7 May 2006
Casino Royale," Before Bond
","'Die Another Day' - the predecessor to 'Casino Royale' - was perhaps the worst James Bond movie ever to grace our screens, so it's with good reason that most cinema goers are approaching the latest Bond instalment with much trepidation.And with all the negative press surrounding Daniel Craig (rumours of his lack of driving abilities, his pain threshold, and - obviously - his blonde hair) it's clear that this was a film that just HAD to impress to stop a flop.But to he honest, no one need have ever worried.In fact, the pressure surrounding Daniel Craig for his performance in 'Bond 21' can only have helped him prove us even more wrong. (And his hair is more blonde/brown, anyway!) The film begins with a gritty black and white opening and breaks the tradition of all 20 other James Bond films previous to this.We swiftly move from one exotic location to another, with impressive directing skills in play by 'Goldeneye' director Martin Campbell. (Lets face it, Goldeneye was the best of the Brosnan era). He delights in particular throughout the card game; not the easiest situation to make interesting for a viewer. (If perhaps the dialogue was unnecessarily propelled by the supporting actors).What is also as equally impressive is Daniel Craig who wears the Bond title like a 10 year old slipper - comfortable. Expect Craig to appear in the Bond suite more than once; he's here for a while - and that is a very good thing! Acting, in general, is flawless. The action sequences are classically formed with blinding special effects and daring sequences reinvented to make us gasp.The script is also to be praised, with keeping the cheesy bond clich√©s alive and well, but in a subtle format.But a warning for when you watch this movie. You must be patient.There's no Q, no gadgets, nothing to relate back to the Brosnan period (or as a matter of fact, any other the other Bonds). This is the bit that has caused the most controversy over Bond fanatics.But I think they are missing the point.This is before James Bond is ACTUALLY James Bond as we know him. This is the distinct reason for lack of the 'Bond Theme', lack of gadgets and lack of familiar characters.The producers have cleverly constructed a film that is actually pre-Bond so that when 'Bond 22' hits our screens we are ready for Daniel Craig to play Bond as we know him.Bond is an extremely flawed character (in terms of traditional Bond) in 'Casino Royale' - he falls in love, he makes mistakes and he gets battered and bruised. (The torture scene is a cringe-worthy but hilarious scene!).This was the point of the film; we see Bonds weaknesses and now we know and understand exactly why he hasn't ever endured long romances or made the mistakes identified in 'Casino Royale.' Make no mistake. Bond 22 will be a return of Bond as we know him - the point of Bond 21 was to show us HOW EXACTLY he BECAME the sleeping around, reckless, ruthless Bond that the English culture has cherished for decades.Expect Bond 22 to be a revival of classic Bond - with all the grit and realism of 'Casino Royale'.And if you can't wait until then, 'Casino Royale' will do the job more than well. It's bloody good.",8,3,5,24 November 2006
