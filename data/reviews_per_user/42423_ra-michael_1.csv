Conquest 1453," Terrible all around
",Aweful movie. Bad acting. Events that never happened. An obvious attempt to make the siege of Constantinople seem like a plus for the inhabitants of the city. Apparently there was a three day massacre of the people of Constantinople which is not even hinted at. Movies like this don't deserve to see the light of day.,1,0,1,3 February 2020
