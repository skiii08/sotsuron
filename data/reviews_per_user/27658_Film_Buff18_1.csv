","United 93 takes us back to the dark hours of the September 11th attacks bringing back anger, sadness, and fear but with thought a sense of hope, I say this due to United 93 showing us the events within the hijacked aircraft. Call sign United 93 with us already knowing the outcome of the first three hijacked planes this is the story of the forth, as the tagline reads Director Paul Greengrass was able to write and direct a movie that needed no explanation. But did require him to show us what by the end of the movie I had realised, was just how evil and inhumane members of humanity can be but still giving us the positive aspect. Being that when faced with destruction those with courage became the embodiment of the definition of humanity, defending others despite realising the eventuality of their lives being lost to protect and defend others. The darkest aspects of humanity were shown on that day but also the valiant aspects had emerged to, this is what I had taken away from United 93 this is what we can all realise after 1 hour and 51 minutes. Not the quality of the movie that was made, but the message that is being displayed, historical events depicting in film are like finding a four-leafed clover so finding the message within the movie is the objective set for the viewer.",7,1,1,15 January 2017
