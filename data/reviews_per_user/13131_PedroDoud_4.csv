Alien 3," Not 'alien' or 'aliens'
","This is the third 'alien' movie. The first one is a classic sci-fi horror movie. The second is a action movie with sci-fi. This is a sci-fi movie, and that's it. The story isn't taking us anywhere, and seems a way to close the trilogy, without any highlights. It's just a movie about Ripley, some inmates and a alien-dog. The twist is so obvious that some may get in the first flashes. The funny thing is that special effects on first movie (1979) still look great today, in this movie (1992) the use of a computerized alien-dog just seems B movie material nowadaysWatch to see a Alien movie, don't watch thinking about the quality of the first two.",3,0,3,6 April 2013
Aliens," Not 'alien'. But great on its own
","A movie that didn't spoiled the legacy of 'Alien' as so many sequels did with their originals. Cameron's movie is good on its own, without having to hold on the first movie. With more actions scene the flick goes to a different direction, on a 'Bad-A' Ripley and thousands of aliens. We see the evil intents of 'The company' even more clearly on this. All this together sequel worth watching for the quality, not 'just to see' as in the third movie.Even the new characters (who are mostly bad news to sequels) have their parts well explained, like Bishop, having to gain Ripley's trust, or Burke, who it's only interested in money. It's a must watch for sure :)",9,1,1,6 April 2013
Across the Universe," Not Yoko, not the Beatles either
","First, two warnings:1)This musical takes the material of 'The Beatles', maybe the most loved band of all times, so, clearly that some people will hate on it even before seen it. But this movie isn't no Yoko Ono, so chill2)This review is divided in two parts, 'For Everybody' and 'For Beatles fans'['For Everybody']This movie starts with a silly 'High School Music' feeling, quite dumb. But, when the principal plot is presented, we are on a ride for some good shots, that move the audience to the 60s, giving the whole experience on the youth of the time. And some times we are led to incredible moments, like the Detroit scene, or the strawberries scene, just blowing minds. With a combination of music, acting and photography that really bring a whole new feel to your soul. A very fun ride for allThis movie have some problems, if you don't have the Beatle's discography you may enjoy a little more the less famous songs, since its never the same thing, and get pretty disappointing when your favorite song is played in a 'wrong way'. Another problem is the feel that the filmmakers tried to shove the most music as they could in the movie, and sometimes you feel like a certain song isn't really needed in the moment.['For Beatles fans'] Don't go to watch this thinking on your idols, the actors do their best, but they aren't Paul, John, George and Ringo. In a homage aspect the movie brings the feel of the music, and on the time. So go for a fun ride, and expect a fan movie made for the Beatles.Ps.: Sorry for the misuse of any word, or any mistake on grammar, English is my third language",7,0,1,7 April 2013
Paranormal Activity," Not big deal
","I start this with a 'I'm sorry for my bad English', I'm BrazillianThe movie receive so much buzz, and all I heard was how terrifying was. For a guy that find every thing scary that movie should be hell. Well, in the time I didn't have enough age to get in on this movie, so I wait till DVD. The movie don't give me nothing, just a guy and a girl on a house saying that they heard something or see something. they start to leave thing so the 'thing' can make marks, the monster, or demon or something like it do thing that a open window in a windy night could do. Anyway, almost in the and the strange events start to increase, more suspicious noises and marks, even a board on fire. After the girl is pulled off of the bed and carried out of the room, and a teeth mark shows up. After that the girl start to act weird, and finally in the very end of the movie the demon really do something taking her body, killing the guy and trowing his dead body though the entire room. So, the good part begun, we gonna see some demon after all. Nope. the girl/demon open her mouth next to the camera and the movie ends. Just in the second I believe that had something in the house. Too bad",1,1,1,21 August 2011
