The Blair Witch Project," willfully misread
","I love The Blair Witch and I think it has one of the best finales in the history of horror films. I kind of wish it hadn't achieved quite the level of success that it did though. That way I wouldn't have had to endure so many goofy comments from the people who hated it. Things like: 'You didn't even get to see the witch' (exactly, the filmmakers decided to plant the horror in the viewer's minds, rather than directly under the camera, it's called subtlety-look it up); and 'what's so scary about a bunch of sticks and rocks' (gee, nothing in and of themselves, why don't you try placing them within the context of the storyline?); and, 'Why didn't these morons just follow the stream back to civilization'(they did, and they ended up right back where they had started....There was a WITCH in the woods with them, you know, supernatural forces keeping them there, no matter what they did)...and don't even get me started on the folks that complain bitterly about the low budget aspects of the whole enterprise, as if said-budget is a filmic crime in and of itself. It's a shame to see such a good little film run into such metaphorical brick walls; I can't remember any recent movie that has been as willfully misread by so many people. I guess Hype does kill.",8,0,1,11 November 1999
The Others," the ghost story is back
","Warning, spoilers ahead--please don't read unless you've seen the film!Predictably, a lot of know-nothings are complaining about the twist at the end of The Others, claiming that it 'rips off' The Sixth Sense. Well, guess what, the-protagonist-who-is-already-dead surprise was *hardly* introduced by The Sixth Sense; this plot device has been around since at least the old days of The Twilight Zone television series of the 50's, and as recently as in an 80's movie called Siesta, which was directed by Mary Lambert and starred Ellen Barkin (oops, looks like I just gave away the ending to that--sorry!). Besides, I have to admit that the twist here (actually the DOUBLE twist) completely threw me, and I was one of those who managed to figure out The Sixth Sense's big surprise midway through the film. Anyway, surprise endings aside, there is much else to admire in this fine ghost story. Nicole Kidman gives a very good, sensitive performance, and she has an excellent supporting cast behind her, particularly the two children, who are entirely believable. The film is rich in atmosphere and uses all the trappings of the classic ghost story (the isolated house, mysterious strangers, darkened rooms, etc.) beautifully. If you like ghost stories (and like me, are happy to see them back at the box office thanks to the success of The Sixth Sense) then hie thee to this fine film.",7,0,0,8 January 2002
The Insider," Expertly made, way overlong
","This is one of an intelligent, well-acted, directed, and photographed films that I just couldn't get all that excited over. It was a bit long, and I guess the subject matter wasn't exactly up my alley. Also, something that always sticks in my craw: isn't it time that directors hire talented actresses like Lindsay Crouse (here in the thankless faithful wife role) and Debi Mazar (as the competent, trusted office assistant), and actually give them more than glorified walk-on roles? You'd never know either one was anything special by watching them in this, but that's nothing new for women in Hollywood of course. Overall, I would recommend this movie to those interested in the story and to Russell Crowe fans (he's never been better than this).",6,0,1,14 November 1999
Rosemary's Baby," A true classic
","This is my favorite horror movie--actually one of my favorite movies, period. It features fantastic direction and performances (special kudos to John Cassavettes, who never gets proper recognition for just how good he was here), a wonderfully 60's-sounding music score that goes from frothy to sinister in mere seconds, and of course there's the intricately brilliant story, faithfully adapted from Ira Levin's 1967 novel. It is one of those movies that effortlessly absorbed and channeled back the tenor of the times in which it was made -- for example, the storyline clearly expands upon the youth movement's late 60's rallying cry of 'Never trust anyone over 30,' and in one pivotal scene there is a glimpse of the 'Is God Dead?' tempest that was a genuine thing, albeit briefly, in the violent, dark reality that was the USA in 1968. Enormously influential, Rosemary's Baby is an acknowledged classic, and a paranoid delight from start to finish. It gets a 10 out of 10, no question.",10,0,1,17 November 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Impossibly overrated
","Don't get me wrong - I liked this movie just fine, I just don't understand how it deserves the *heaps* of rapturous praise it regularly receives from IMDb members, and the fact that is has been ranked at #2 in the hallowed IMDb Top 250 for the past 8 years or so just baffles me. It was certainly entertaining enough, and very well-acted, but also way over-long, and filled with the usual stock characters that seem to inhabit every prison drama (if Hollywood movies are to be believed, prison wardens are mainly just nasty SOB's and the inmates are just the best bunch of guys you'd ever want to meet). I'd recommend the movie as a good renter, but I guess I can't see it as any more than that. I realize I am way in the minority on this, however.",1,9,32,5 January 2000
The Conjuring," Good not great ghost story
","A decent spooker - it doesn't live up to many of the rave reviews it has received, but it's not bad at all. Most horror films these days are so by-the-numbers that the better ones like this often get graded higher on a curve. As with so many ghost stories I found Conjuring's windup better and way more frightening than the eventual climactic events - the atmosphere was so dread-filled that I (a died-in-the-wool horror veteran) was genuinely uneasy for the first half hour or so. As more was revealed it got less frightening - I still find that the less you see, the less you know, the more your imagination has to fill in the blanks - the scarier a movie tends to be. The performances were all top-notch, particularly Vera Farmiga as the medium; special mention should be made of the younger actresses, who were all very believable. Definitely the best horror film of 2013 that I've seen, but again, I'm grading it on a curve.",6,1,2,24 November 2013
