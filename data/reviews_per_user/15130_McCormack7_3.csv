Raiders of the Lost Ark," HARRISON FORD, KAREN ALLEN, STEVEN SPIELBERG - HOW COULD YOU LOSE!
","The talent assembled for this movie is simply spot-on. HARRISON FORD (What Lies Beneath, Star Wars, Fugitive, Witness) proves he is a one-of-a-kind star in this action adventure film - he is simply perfect in everyway. KAREN ALLEN (Starman, Perfect Storm, Scrooged, Animal House) is also fantastic as Indy's spunky sidekick, Marion. The Nazi villains and Sallah are also perfect. The direction is perfect. In fact the whole damn movie is PERFECT! What more can be said about this great film. It has all the right ingredients and everyone looks like they are having fun. The audience is right there having fun with them. Far better than the two sequels. HARRISON, KAREN, STEVEN and GEORGE lets have another INDY. Please!",Null,0,0,17 April 2001
Man of Steel," Very entertaining and heartfelt Superman film - great acting by Costner and Diane Lane
","Very entertaining and heartfelt Superman film - great acting by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner (should have had more scenes).I really enjoyed 'MAN OF STEEL' much more than I thought I would. The action was cool, the effects epic and most importantly you cared for the characters. The best scenes involved Ma and Pa Kent played with heartfelt gravitas by DIANE LANE (Best Actress Oscar nominee for Unfaithful, Perfect Storm) and KEVIN COSTNER (Oscar winner for Dances With Wolves). All the actors are good but those two shone for me and should have had more scenes. In fact it was the supporting actors who are the more well known stars... COSTNER, DIANE LANE, RUSSELL CROWE, LAURENCE FISHBURNE... yet it is HENRY CAVILL (who I am not familiar with) who holds the film together with a superb portrayal of Superman / Clark Kent. A good movie with good characters and it is very entertaining.",10,13,22,7 December 2013
Hardball," KEANU REEVES and DIANE LANE shine in film that is uplifting
","KEANU REEVES (The Matrix, Speed) and DIANE LANE (The Perfect Storm, My Dog Skip) do wonderful work in this uplifting comedy/drama. 'HARDBALL' really has everything going for it - adorable kids who are very funny and sweet (with the occassional foul language), KEANU REEVES who is just right for this role, and the ever reliable DIANE LANE who proves once again that even with limited screen time she IS a star. The supporting actors are good and the ghetto scenes realistic. The baseball sequences were superbly done and the films sad, happy, sad, happy rollercoaster ride was superbly executed. The final uplifting end of the movie is just what we need. HARDBALL with KEANU REEVES and DIANE LANE is a home run! DIANE LANE also stars in THE GLASS HOUSE released this same week.",8,0,0,17 September 2001
