Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful and Interesting BUT...
","Three hours? Really? The length of this movie had to be due to hubris... I appreciate Denis Villeneauve but this film was unnecessarily long and I have to imagine he thought everything he included was not just necessary but also interesting. It wasn't.However, the visuals and some of the plot were enough to keep me engaged throughout. I've never seen the original(ya I know. relax.) but I appreciated that it wasn't necessary to understand what was happening in this sequel made so many years later.I honestly thought the story really had something going right up until the director tried to subvert our expectations a la Game of Thrones style. The 'twist' was lame and I immediately lost interest and missed the time I spent watching the film.As for Gosling, he's never been a favorite of mine but I really enjoyed his performance here.Harrison Ford was Harrison Ford. The movie didn't need him in it but whatever. Jared Leto was there... being weird and not much else. The script really didn't give him anything to do.It was clear that the producers let Villeneauve run with this one when maybe they should've reined him in a bit but hey -- there are only a tiny handful of really talented directors working right now and it's fair to count him among them so I get it. 7/10 enjoyable but far from a sci fi game changer.",7,0,2,10 September 2019
Hereditary," People that don't pay to see movies loved it.
","Like so many of these artsy fartsy 'horrors' these days, Hereditary is marketed as a horror but spends 3 1/2 quarters of the film being a tragic family drama. Which would've been fine had I known I was going to spend the majority of the film watching a family drama. Then out of no where the last 15 minutes turns into the exorcist. The main characters, the graham family is almost completely irrelevant because there is a big bad manipulating them... i guess? But we never see who these people are... we don't know why they're doing what they're doing. It just happens and you go... okay... so there's a group of people that want to bring a demon into the world. okie doke. We have no idea why the grandmother would do all the things she's done... literally no clue. No backstory... nothing. The grandmothers relationship to Ann Dowd's priestess character... totally skimmed over. Seriously... Toni Collette literally skims over it in a picture book.I gave this 5 points for the performances alone. Toni Collette was a force. The dinner table scene gave me goosebumps. The film as a whole felt like one huge lead up to nothing...unless there is a sequel. But with A24 and their artsy bulls*** I doubt we'll get one and I'm not sure I'd pay for it anyway.If you have a wifi bill or maybe a couple groceries you need to get...save your money on this one and go get what you need. This movie is for the tight a** critics... the folks that don't pay hard earned money to see movies.",5,1,4,20 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," The hype is real!!
","You know...The last time I saw a movie because of it's hype was Wonder Woman. Which was unbelievably god awful. After that monstrosity i swore I'd never see another movie based on good or 'sponsored' reviews ever again! I saw a trailer or two for Thor Ragnarok and thought..looks cool..looks pretty funny actually...But nah, I'll wait till I can stream it on some website for free. Hey I live in LA..going to a movie costs more than my wifi bill. Then I looked at the cast--Chris Hemsworth..a pretty boy who can actually act. Okay. Tom Hiddleston..I like the guy..and he plays Loki to absolute perfection. Okay. Idris Elba..my dude! always gotta support that guy..and looks like they actually gave him something to do..instead of relegating one of the most talented actors working right now to a featured extra role. Okay again. Cate Blanchett , while I respect her talent, has always been a bit POSH for my tastes. Not the most accessible actress I've ever seen. I always thought she would think herself above this sort of movie. However, she was great and seemed to really enjoy the role.Then they threw in my baby Tessa Thompson. OKAY. Jeff Goldblum..playing JEFF GOLDBLUM. I was laughing the second he showed up in the trailer. And Anthony Hopkins..legend of legends. He truly is the heart of this franchise and thats made really clear in this film.Guys..it was great. When I say it was hilarious..It was truly funny..but not in a stupid, completely misplaced way like Age of Ultron..or ANY of the other marvel movies. This director captured exactly how we communicate with our friends, family and significant others. Taika captured US! People. The Audience. He made his characters in our image..and it was amazing. I laughed, I cried, I cheered. Thor Ragnarok is exactly was this genre is supposed to be.",9,10,20,9 November 2017
Suicide Squad," Why and How is Will Smith the star of this movie?!?!
","Where to start...woe is me...where to start?!?! First I'll say I was looking forward to this movie for a long time..like many people. All I really cared about was of course...the resurrection of The Joker!I think Jared Leto has the kind of God given talent that can never be taught to any actor. He was born with it, like Nicholson and Ledger before him. So needless to say I was absolutely stoked to see what he would do with such an iconic character. I didn't really care much about anything else. Which leads me to say WOW! The marketing on this film was the definition of false advertisement. There were so many interesting story lines to play with here. The Joker and Harley Quinn with their demented love story wouldve been my first choice. It was Jared Leto and Margot Robbie that shouldve been leading this movie...NOT WILL SMITH! guys I can't stress enough how much i dislike Will Smith. Guys this whole movie revolves around Will Smith playing Will Smith in a movie where he's supposed to be playing Deadshot.God I can't stress enough just how much he ruined this movie for me. Basically he did his whole schtick from Hancock but threw on an extra layer of 'stereotypical hood black guy' and called it Deadshot. As an African American..I cringed every time he opened his mouth.Sorry about my Will Smith melt down...he is just really awful.I really would've liked to understand more about Enchantress..there was definitely not enough time to establish her at all. The 'Villains' were literally moving props whose only purpose was to slow our heroes down.Also, I'm not sure Cara Delevigne has the gravitas to really dig into Enchantress...but I could be wrong...The fail on June Moone could very well all be on David Ayer's shoulders. Also the CGI for Enchantress and her movements in the final sequence were actually laughable. I couldn't take her seriously.Diablo was the only actual Metahuman and they didn't explain his origin whatsoever. Not in a meaningful way anyway. Captain Boomerang wasn't terrible..not memorable either. Killer croc was there...could barely understand anything he said...but he was there...and apparently loves BET(GTFOH). Viola Davis was solidly cold hearted as Amanda Waller. Davis, Leto and Robbie were the only strong points of the film and there was not nearly enough of them.Personally, I really enjoyed Batman V Superman. I know the plot was a bit of jumbled mess and the bat vs supes was like 5 mins long and then there was Doomsday..ugh. But I still really liked it. There was a lot of it that dealt to me very believable circumstances. I can't say the same for SS...I never bought it. Not once did I sink into the story of the characters...I was always very aware I was in a movie theater watching the fresh prince flap his lips.To the folks at Warner Bros..ya'll need to step your game up..and do it quickly. You cannot keep making sub par movies like this. I'm this upset and I didn't even have to pay to see this movie. I can't even imagine the folks that are shelling out hard earned money for the 2 hour crapfest I just sat through. Jeez man...What a waste of Jared Leto. Save your money guys and pirate this crapfest in a week.",1,131,211,8 August 2016
Justice League," DC needs a reboot.
","This was disappointing to say the least. I loved Man of Steel, I really enjoyed BVS even though I understood it had some pitfalls...But Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman were unforgivably awful to me. Wonder Woman was terrible...I don't care what magazine tries to tell me it was good...it wasn't. I understand it was supposed to be important bc It was the first female superhero..We want it to win...As an African American...believe me I get it. And I was rooting for it...But it was horrible.Justice League was just more Wonder Woman. It truly makes me sad. I was really behind Zak Snyder's vision. He was going for a different more adult oriented tone with the DC Universe as opposed to Marvel. But instead of embracing and defending Zak's vision Warners caved to fanboys and critics...People this is how creativity dies. When, instead of making things we're inspired to make...we make things we think people want to see.Marvel has their cartoonish characters...And they do them well. But I really identified and empathized with Zak's Superman and Batman. They were the most human I've ever seen these characters.Justice League was a cartoon. Like the justice league on cartoon network when i was a kid...only somehow cheesier. This movie was screaming PLEASE LIKE ME...PLEASE PLEASE LIKE ME! Like some desperate high school girl.Where BVS might've run too long...Justice League was WAY too short! Warner Bros is a completely a$$ backwards studio. I just wish they had the conviction to commit to making something we haven't seen...I understand they have a 200 million dollar investment...But i truly believe if they had stood up to these di*kless nerds and said NO! WE'RE MAKING BATMAN AND SUPERMAN THIS WAY! And if you want that childish garbage..GO OVER TO MARVEL!Again...it was sooo rushed! You have the biggest superheros in the world! They dwarf Marvels best...and they each got 5 minutes of intro time?!? Unreal. Even superman's return needed MORE time!..He comes back..goes beast mode on the team then he goes back to the farm WTF?!? DC/Warner's is a mess guys. I think we need..dare I say...Chris Nolan. Warners needs a director they can trust wholeheartedly and though I support Snyder...clearly Warners does not.",4,1,4,21 November 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," If every Marvel movie had been like Infinity War...
",I'd be a diehard Marvel fan. I've seen every one of these movies... sometimes I went to the theater... sometimes I just waited till it was made available and I could watch whenever for free. No matter where or how I saw them I almost always walked saying the same thing... Eh. When Iron Man came out I was still a teenager and I really enjoyed it... but after that it was honestly the most mature of the films until Infinity War or should I say Marvel's Dark Knight LOL! Still had all the Marvel humor but was much darker or really deeper than anything Ive seen from this studio. I bet DC has to be feeling pretty embarrassed about Marvel's CG villain!! Holy crap. Seriously DC... and i'm a fan but go back to the drawing board bc Thanos just literally shamed everything you've done since Dark Knight Trilogy. Obviously I won't spoil anything but I definitely had tears in my eyes at the end... not because I love everything Marvel but bc I was truly that moved. This was a hard earned 10/10... all credit due to the directors Joe and Anthony Russo! The years of hard work I'm sure went into this REALLY SHOWED. Inspiring.,10,2,4,30 April 2018
A Quiet Place," This was NOT a good movie
","I've heard the people involved in this film say 'it's not about the monsters, it's about the family' Whatever. A lazy deflection to excuse the writers and director from taking responsibilities for wide gaping crater holes in the script and scenarios that ignore common sense. You see plot holes and lack of common sense are totally common in the horror genre... which is exactly why this movie does NOTHING new for the genre. Let me at least compliment the acting... it was indeed solid. Emily Blunt always delivers... somebody trade her to Cavs so Lebron can get some water. The actress that plays her daughter, Millicent something...(im sure ill be learning her name very soon) was fantastic. Actually both the child actors were fantastic.Now here's my problem... I'm not one of those annoying nitpicks that gripe about every single detail. But don't ask me to suspend my disbelief for two hours if you're going to ignore the basic laws of common sense. Exhibit A: Why the F was a 4 year old kid LEFT SEVERAL FEET BEHIND THE FAMILY ALONE DURING THE APOCALYPSE?!?!? Exhibit B: Someone...please someone explain to me why?!?!? during the F'ing apocalypse this husband and wife duo couldn't grab some condoms while they grabbed meds at the pharmacy?!? Are you forreal?! You think this is a good time to expand the family? Exhibit C: Maybe this can be debated... the fastest birth ever on earth!!!!! She legit pooped that kid out. Exhibit D: Monster bursts out of the steel container like its freakin paper...can't break the windows or metal of a rusty old truck 5 minutes later?Listen A+ for creating tension in a fresh way. Having most of the movie be the actions of characters instead of their words in definitely powerful and is also the best way to evaluate good or crappy acting. If i can watch something with the volume off and it still affects me... then those actors did a damned good job. And I get it... for all the people in the theater there was probably only one other person that wasnt so distracted by the music and jump scares to ignore the wide open holes and cliche idiot decisions. Sorry folks... this was not the gamechanger everyone would have you believe it was. Looking forward to Hereditary...",5,8,16,8 May 2018
Wonder Woman," I'm done. I don't trust IMDb anymore
","I've had the sneaking suspicion that IMDb reviews were bought and paid for but I was never sure until this movie came out. Every review those first few days were GLOWING 10/10. Couldn't wrap my head around it..were people seeing a different movie than I saw? Then a few of my friends left negative reviews--those reviews were flagged and promptly taken down. Then I left a negative review..next day? same thing. WHOA.After a few weeks had passed and WW was declared a box office success I checked back on IMDb AND finally thats when the REAL reviews started showing up. People thought this movie was awful..because it was. Look I read some reviews that said Gal Gadot can't act..shes a model..so on and so forth. I don't agree. This movie was absolutely terribly written and directed. If she looked like she was walking a runway in every F'ing scene..it's because of the director..not her. Think back to BVS..She was awesome in that--she had depth, darkness and this sexy shroud of mystery. They really set her like a super powered Femme Fatale. In WW she said stupid sh*t like ' I fight for love'....whatttttt?I'm done reading and listening to reviews. I could give a crap what some paid off critic says! I'm going off my own instinct and deciding for myself from here on out if I want to pay my hard earned money to see a film!Wonder Woman looked absolutely terrible in the trailers. I could tell it was going to be awful..and then it came out..and supposedly EVERYONE(who the heck is 'everyone' anyway? no one I know.) was raving about it. So I caved..I went to see it.My girlfriend and I were so bummed we wasted that money I cant even tell you! People were walking out 40 minutes in. The people left at the end were BOOING!These critics were paid off! If these same people can tell you BVS was a bad film..then rave about this heaping pile...THEN THEY ARE CORRUPT LIARS! They really are fake news! I'm finished with critics. Rave reviews. Rotten tomatoes! If something looks good to me..then ill see it! and if doesn't I won't!30 dollars I'll never see again! Could've went to in and out! Wasted my friggin cheat day on this ish!",1,10,26,4 July 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The 2nd best comic book adaptation after Dark Knight
","Let me start by saying..I LOVED THIS MOVIE! I loved it. Why? well so many reasons but heres a few. The tone. This movie wasn't just dark...it was scary. I never jump in the movie theater..I very rarely have the 'holy crap reaction' But buddy..did I have both in this film. I jumped while screaming holy crap.Batman..Oh the many losers who crapped all over my man Ben. Were you morons proved wrong or what?! Hands down the best incarnation of both Bruce Wayne and Batman! hands down! Even w/ Nolan's trilogy I still never liked or even really cared about Bruce Wayne. He was boring. How can I believe that this guy is waging a war against some of the worst human beings on earth but never sheds any blood? Yeah right.This Batman or Batfleck is real. He's messed up, shellshocked, war weary, suffering from probably a wicked case of PTSD and he's a killer when he needs to be. I believe this Bruce Wayne..I believe in his exhaustion, I believe in his fear, his anger...I BELIEVE!I hear that some people wanted to see a lighter, funnier flick...Go watch the Avengers..So much 'humor' in that crap and couldn't even make myself care about anything happening.The only thing i didn't care for was the final fight scene. could've been simplified..more brutal. It was a little too ...i dunno..showy. Lex Luthor...I liked this psychotic Mark Zuckerberg that Eisenberg was playing with. I think honestly I was just happy to see a Lex Luthor I haven't seen before. Which is the trick with these characters..They're like 100 years old. And people are so married to the way they think they should be portrayed that in each movie you just get the same ol boring character.All in all I loved it..It delivered in a way that I was not expecting!",10,130,235,5 April 2016
