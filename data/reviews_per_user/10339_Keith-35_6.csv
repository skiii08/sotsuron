Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A tribute to good action movies.
","The story is simple.  An assassin walks on on her trade.  Her ex-colleagues find her some months later at her wedding and slaughter everyone, but she survives and this movie is about her revenge.This is classic Tarrantino.  For me, this is his best work yet.  It is a real tribute to story telling and a tribute to Hong Kong Kung Fu movies, Japanese Anime and the all time great, Shogun Assasin.  I loved the inclusion of Shogun Assassin at the end of Part 2.  O'ren ends in the same was as the Masters of Death.Authenticity was preserved in the use of Chinese and Japanese artists and it showed.  From the story of O'ren in Part 1 to the final death blow in Part 2, the telling of this story rests on the pedigree of the action best story tellers.I loved it.",10,0,1,5 July 2004
Fight Club," Very good movie with a twist.
",This is a very good movie where the main character finds himself  getting more and more into his 'escape'.  He only realises the truth at the end.A very good and credible movie that is spoiled by a happy ending that isn't credible.,8,0,1,30 November 1999
Akira," You really need to see the DVD.
","I've seen Akira on TV and video in the UK.  Having seen the (US) DVD it's clear that many clips were removed from the versions I saw.  The DVD version's story is much clearer with these 'missing' clips and retranslation.The DVD does omit some scenes that appear on the (UK) VHS version, but I only noticed one missing one.Akira tells the story of quantitative western science's mishandling of something metaphysical and the disastrous consequences.  The story is set in the future.The moral? We don't learn from our mistakes.I believe this was the first movie marketed by Manga in the UK.  An excellent introduction to Anime.",9,1,3,11 December 2001
Blade II," Nonstop big screen action
","You've seen Blade.  You know the story.  Now sit back and immerse yourself in this non-stop action movie.The pace at the beginning is Guyver, with a little Fist of the North Star and Tenchi thrown in.  I think it was inspired from Anime.I missed the Tai Chi sword forms in Blade, but we've got some Wing Chun instead.  It's all good.There's no time for romance, or humor, just friendship, moral courage and action.  The lighting, background music, visual and audio effects are all excellent.I've seen this movie on DVD but the effects are diminished.  You really need to see this movie on the big screen preferably with DTS sound.",10,14,16,14 October 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Don't waste your time
","After such a brilliant start, The Matrix trilogy has descended into nonsense.  So much for the promise of exploring dualism, or AI (or any sort of intelligence).  The only thing that could possibly be worse would be the John Connor turning up at the end to lead humanity to freedom.The only saving act was Jada Pinkett.  It was sad to see Morpheus rendered impotent.If we look at it from the point of the story, these remain unanswered.*  What was the Oracle's goal?*  What happened to the Oracle anyway?*  What was the Oracle's relationship with the Architect?*  If the Oracle didn't create the Matrix, who did?*  How come Smith defeated Neo but lost anyway?*  What happened to Neo, after all, he still needs to eat.*  Why is Neo always smooching Trinity when she's dying?*  How come the sentinels can't hear a 50 ton hovercraft, but can hear a single piece of metal fall?*  Now the humans are to be released from the Matrix, how will the machines survive?And then there is a whole other set of questions like:*  What's up with the useless minders who fight from the ceiling?The list is in fact endless but should probably end with:*  What was going thru their minds when they made this movie?",2,0,0,6 November 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Well worth watching
","Million Dollar Baby is of the classical zero to hero format, but with a difference. Clint Eastwood's character is the typical ageing hero that we came to know in Unforgiven. Morgan Freeman's is also similar, the voice of reason and the only one old enough and experienced enough to make an impact.All credit to Clint Eastwood and his evident clout in the business to be allowed to pull of a movie that did not have your typical happy Hollywood ending that has ruined so many otherwise excellent movies.As a result, watching this movie is time well spent. The movie lingers on in my thoughts and it's not easy to forget the dilemma posed.More impressive however, is the real life achievements of Lucia Rijker. It's a pity that with all that behind her, she had to settle for playing the bad guy.",10,4,7,13 February 2005
