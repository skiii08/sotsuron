Sucker Punch," it's a visual feast!!!
","Zack Snyder is spoiling us with great visual movies, and this one is not exception. In spite of the bad reviews by some of the so-called specialized critics the movie is quite interesting. we get to travel inside the mind of this girl called BabyDoll while she's trying to get herself free from this mental asylum that her stepfather managed to get her in, dragging at the same time the other girls that befriended with her. The catch in here is that every step towards freedom is a battle that they fight. We get to see all these actresses that we wouldn't normally see in an action/fantasy movie, and they kick-ass. Along with a great visual we get a great score, functioning perfectly. Ultimately this a movie about greed, human exploitation with a mask of respectability, survival and freedom.",10,2,5,7 August 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Could you leave the one you love?
","Could you leave the one you love? Could you close one door, knowing that from now on your life is going to be meaningless? Once again the genius mind of Philip K. Dick brings us a story about fate and free will and the consequences that outcome from it. The screenplay from, the also director, George Nolfi is quite well written, specially the dialogue between the Damon's character and Terence Stamp's. Matt Damon once again takes a firm step on his career, portraying the senate candidate entangled in the domains of life changing choices. Emily Blunt gives a solid effort becoming a convincing contemporary dancer. Both of them have a good chemistry. But the scene stealer is Terence Stamp aka The Hammer, providing a performance concealing his emotions. Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and the all the supporting cast are quite good. The Black Swan meets Matrix with a sprinkle of Romeo and Juliet's forbidden love.",Null,0,0,17 July 2011
