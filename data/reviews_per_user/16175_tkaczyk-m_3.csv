Resident Evil: Afterlife," Unbearable
","I'm kinda into Mila thanks to her movie debut with Bruce Willis and I kinda enjoy the Resident Evil general concept. With those two thoughts in mind I settled in for this title. What I was hoping for was a decent production. Boy, was I wrong.It's just... plain dumb an poorly executed. I really, really tried to enjoy this movie as I was watching it with my fianc√©e who likes the series. And this one left both of us with a bad taste in our mouth.The action scenes are inconsequent both in quality and pace, they lack flair or finesse. I find it insulting when every possible scene of the film is easily predictable (just as the final outcome).What is more - this part of the Resident Evil universe seemed to me as a prequel, not a sequel. The ending firmly established the plot for another production and does it in a way, which I find embarrassing.I could try to write about the plot, but it would just end in me smacking each and every part of it with a big hammer. Alongside with bashing Wentworth Miller for absolute lack of any acting skill, as he seemed to me to be Michael Scofield pasted into this universe. Well... with shooting added.There are no twists (well, for anybody above age 6), humor is non-existent and the actions scenes are surreal in their dumbness, poorly directed and simply boring.To be honest, Resident Evil: Afterlife is a movie worth missing.The one and only good part of the movie is the main actress herself. I find Mila a very beautiful (in a unique and intriguing way) woman.And I suggest watching 'The Fifth Element' to experience that. It will be fun, exactly the opposite to Resident Evil: Afterlife.",2,0,2,14 November 2010
Star Trek," To all Trekkers and Trekkies
","I've decided to delete my previous comment and raise the note because of the comments I've seen.To be honest - I don't understand you all. The original ST series is dead. Point. It was, in my humble opinion, revived in a respectful matter by TNG and there I stopped. Therefore my opinion is based just on some original movies,TNG, a few eps of Voyager, some games and nothing more. I don't mind being an ignorant in the eyes of some fans.To the point. Let's make an example of Fallout 3. I enjoyed the game, but was fully aware of the fact, that after many years it was impossible to suit all fans and not keep up to date with modern game technology.The same goes with Star Trek. I think that it's formula is worth presenting to the younger generation, because it's a great universe with lots of genuine characters and plots. What would you really expect? A copy of the old series? Or an updated version?Oh yes, Volcan was destroyed. So what? Keep the old storyline in memory and enjoy the new one, where Spock is a more complex character at the beginning.I look forward to seeing a new series of many movies with this cast, developing new courses of action rather than seeing old story being retold. If the second option was chosen, you would be all despised by the fact of barging into a territory of ST cult. Instead, the team decided to make something new from something old.Is it bad? Your choice.I enjoyed the new movie. Really. Because the casting was done superbly and opens lots of possibilities for the future. Rather than nagging about inconsistencies or legend abridgerations I'd prefer to call it, as many are, an alternative (though following the same path) version with lots of cinematic improvements.And having seen the new Kirk and Spock, completed by the XXI visual effects, I'm thinking fondly of the future productions. I recommend you do the same and while in love with the classic productions, try to enjoy the fresh view.",10,4,13,21 May 2009
RED," Completely absurd but absolutely lovable one
","I really hope that more films like Red will be made in the following years. I knew I had to see this after I checked the payroll.Red laughs at action films right in the face. Bruce Willis laughs at himself a few time. To be honest, so does the rest of the cast.It's a simple story in which all the characters are described by the first scene they appear in and it's so damn enjoyable to watch. You don't expect the movie to be anything more than fun. The plot is plain simple, but the way it's executed gives it air to breathe.A few more twists would be nice, a bit more of Malkovich too. But I don't regard these issues as flaws. The would have only contributed to the overall movie reception, not it's essence.The cast, the obvious winks, the effects (with really big winks) and the lightness of the whole picture (you expect fun and it delivers) makes Red a film worth watching. Maybe not buying a DVD, but surely renting it for a while.",7,0,0,14 November 2010
