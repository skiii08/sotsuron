The Ring," Not as good as I thought
","The first thing I heard about this movie, is that it was the most scary movie ever. I totally disagree with that.In my opinion, there isn't a single scary thing in the entire movie! This movie is more like a thriller than a horror movie. You see a couple of silly dead characters and that's it. Even Resident Evil is scarier.I haven't seen Ringu yet, but this American conversion isn't as good as everybody says.",1,2,7,21 April 2003
