Casablanca," The pedestal
",Every movie genre has a film or films that set some type of standard. This movie as set several standards across the board. I guess in the romance section this would be apart of that collection.I guess we all go threw stages in our lives where people pop in and out and sometime we are just looking for the right person. Sometimes we need to come back to life as Rick did.Other aspect of the movie I enjoyed were the music and how it set the tone and how you can seem to relate to the other characters in the film because at one point we have all been one of them. I guess a lot of people can see them selfs in the movie and thats why they enjoy it so much.,7,0,2,6 December 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Tone it down?
","I guess everyone needs to take a break from reality. I guess back then you could poke fun at serious situations. I wish we could do that today.I think its great how Peter played 3 roles. It makes me think of Mike Myers playing 3 roles in Austin Powers.Poking fun at the big wigs is always humors, maybe its because its how most of us think of them. Chickens with there heads cut off.I think people should try an make a movie like this today, with out making it overly political. If they could make that work than I would be really impressed.",6,0,4,14 December 2009
The Graduate," I wish..
","As I graduate in the next week I can relate to this film. I thought this movie was a good comedy that also dealt with the true struggles in life. The idea that the film showed us how someone dealt with finding them self's threw up and downs in a humors way.The key element to the film were all of the long takes. I think that besides adding to the affect of the film, it gives you time to visualize your self in the scene. If your not seeing your self in the scene your thinking about a time where you were going threw the same thing. I hope that I can have a graduation like Ben's... I think we all kinda with we had some crazy story like that...",8,0,0,14 December 2009
