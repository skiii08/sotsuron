Casablanca," Beautifully spoiled for me
","I have spent years upon years being told that this is one of the greatest movies of all time in detail. And while, now that I have seen it, I can absolutely see where those feelings are coming from, they didn't translate for me personally BECAUSE of the detail in which people discussed this film. I knew the big ending and pretty much the entire plot going in. It made it a little harder for me to get emotionally connected to what was happening. The best surprise for me was just how much I loved the relationship between Rick and Louie. I can see now why this is an iconic friendship. Tied to this, I loved the message that every ending has its own beginning as Rick and Louis walk off into the mist together. It's a nice change of pace in a day where the end of every film ends with the couple riding off into the sunset. Here, we have the opposite, but it didn't leave me feeling remotely sad or cheated. I was satisfied with knowing Rick had made the right decision and that he had Louis at his side.",7,1,3,13 April 2014
The Graduate," Poetry brought to life
","Every once in a while you see a film that embeds itself beneath your skin. Whether it's the movie itself, or just happening to see that film at exactly the right time in your life. The Graduate for me, is one of those films.The beauty of this film is how the mood and feelings of the main character dictate everything else. The lighting, sound, editing; everything is all about Benjamin and how he is relating to this world he lives in. When he feels suffocated by the world he is in and isolated from everything that surrounds him, we too feel it in the absolute silence the director allows. In fact, the most poignant moments of the film for me were when the character didn't speak at all. The blank look on his face tied in with music that so brilliantly conveyed everything going on inside him that he just could not get out said more about his character in a single scene than some movies can pull off through their entire course. The plot itself mirrored the turmoil and confusion going on inside Benjamin. How indecisive and unsure he was about what he wanted to be and how he fit into the world. He wiles his time away with Mrs. Robinson (his feelings on this relationship can be summed up in the scene where his father asks him what he is doing and he responds, 'I'm drifting') while trying to find himself and understand just exactly who Benjamin is. When he happens across Elaine, he finally feels that rush that comes with having a sense of purpose. She is someone he can connect to and can feel like himself with. He has an identity with her as opposed to with her mother where he nothing more than a fake name. On that note, I adored the scene where he entered the hotel with Elaine, everybody calling him by this other name he has gone by for ages now; a reminder of how lost he has been with Mrs. Robinson. But this is taken away from him by Mrs. Robinson when she lies about what he has done and turns her family against him. His time drifting is now his undoing.The ending scene was perfection because it wasn't a clear cut happy ending. Benjamin made his decision to go after Elaine; to claim his identity in her outside of Mrs. Robinson and his own family, but the expressions on their faces as soon as the adrenaline wears off speak of the fact that they don't quite have things figured out yet. The world is not a cut and dry place, and because of that, the ending of The Graduate could not be cut and dry.",10,0,0,23 April 2014
Singin' in the Rain," One of the best musicals ever
","Given how much I love musicals, I really shouldn't have been surprised I dug this movie. Call it snobbery, but I rather was! I've had opportunities in the past to watch this before I actually sat down and did. That's years lost where I could have been rewatching!This movie has everything I like in a musical. Incredible singing, and dance numbers that tie in beautifully to the plot being the chief thing I look for. I like the music numbers to mean something, and here they did. I found my face on the verge of breaking from how hard I was smiling and as soon as I finished the film, I was on youtube rewatching my favorite scenes. I fell completely in love with the three lead characters and their relationships to one another. They are your classic story telling triumvirate, each adding something to the puzzle that the others couldn't. Good Morning was my favorite, not because of the song itself, but because I got to see these three let loose together and have fun. It goes without saying how absolutely stunning the visuals were. The colors blew me away and the only film today that I think comes close to its beauty is Moulin Rouge. This film though had the room to play around with so much more color wise given how it was right on the edge of when color films were becoming the norm making it really stand out.I'd rec this to anybody who loves musicals or feel good films. So glad I finally saw this.",10,0,1,18 April 2014
Psycho," Not my favorite Hitchcock
","This one was really hurt for me by knowing all of the twists and turns. While a lot of Hitchcock films can stand up even with knowing what happens, I don't think this one does. It's such a pure horror film, there to shock and disturb. If you know where it's going, how can you be shocked? I also wasn't overly thrilled with the concept of a boy who loves his mom that much. I get that was part of what was unsettling for the viewer, but it unsettled me past the point of enjoyment.That being said, I really loved the use of location. It's a film that stays in mostly one place, and yet never feels stale. Hitchcock did a brilliant job turning that motel into something to be feared. The actors also did a fantastic job projecting the sense that something was just slightly off, a feeling that built the farther into the film you got.I can only wonder how I would have felt about this film had the penultimate shower sequence and reveal of the mother not been so ingrained in my memory.",7,0,5,7 May 2014
