The Blair Witch Project," Realism - in a degree never seen before
","Hard to say anything about this. Is it good ? Is it bad ? I don't know. I just know that I've sat during the movie nearly without any move, with full concentration, without thinking about anything else but the movie, what will happen next. It was so realistic. Is reality good or bad ? Does any of the ordinary categories for movies matter if its real, and not only a game ?This movie focuses enormously, nay in an ideal way, on the character development. There is no sudden change, no compression of the emotions, like normally in movies. Everything happens in a way and speed normal emotions of real people would develop. If the characters had changed very much, there had been a pause of some hours where they didn't used the camera. I repeat myself, everything here looks totally real. I've never seen that in this degree in a movie before. And I'm wondering why I've never missed that in all these comedies and tragedies and maladies (french: illnesses) I've seen before. So often I've called a movie 'realistic' before, not knowing that it wasn't realistic at all, compared with this reference.This is not a horror movie. Read it again: this is not a horror movie. One could say much about the properties of all horror movies I've seen before, brutal, idiotic, boring, or sometimes funny, and some classical movies (such as Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)) even brilliant - but they where never, never realistic. I often cursed inside when I saw how illogical people behave in ordinary horror movies. Not here. No way. So at least if you're a fan of horror movies, you are not at all guaranteed to like this one, for its so different.The screen picture is often of very bad quality, especially in the night. Is this a fault or an advantage ? Of course, this is also realistic; the ears gets more informations what's happening than the eye in the night.  So what should I say ? Who could enjoy this movie ? I've no clue. I guess that many horror fans might even hate it. Everyone might hate it. But everyone might also love it. I've no clue, except that I think (I'm not finally sure!) I myself liked it.Will there ever be a movie like this so successful ? I think so. It has very big faults, but also big strengths, and I think its strength are the more important ones. Again, I'm not sure. I don't know if I've seen a revolution or a bad joke of a movie.",9,1,1,2 December 1999
The Incredible Hulk," The Elf and her Orc
","So Arwen is back and this time she's even with an Orc. Optically, Liv Tyler looks even more like an elf now, than ever before, with her really extremely long face. People might criticize her acting, but its hard to look good next to a Edward Norton, and personally I didn't mentioned any flaw at all in it; for me, she was totally believable.Criticizing Edward Norton would probably be a sacrilege by now. The legitimate successor of Robert de Niro, the man who can play a tree (de Niro about de Niro), is of course again far beyond any criticism in his acting skills. I thorough enjoyed his interpretation of Hulk.Tim Roth also does a good work as usual, even if his character was rather one dimensional. The story is not record breaking, but was definitely okay. All in all the movie was about as good or bad as Iron Man, but couldn't reach the level of the Spiderman Trilogy or the new Batman movies, due to lack of depth in the story. It definitely has a much, much, much better romance than the last of these movies, though.What really enraged me was the fact that they cut so much of the showdown. Cant mention details to avoid spoilers, but the German version was nothing short of butchered in this respect; the German viewer really had no idea whatsoever how the villain was finally brought down.",8,3,5,23 July 2008
50 First Dates," Extreme Movie
","This is an extreme movie in multiple respects.First, the general plot idea is extremely good. This could have been one of the most charming love movies ever.Second, Drew Barrymore is extremely ideal for her character here, extremely charming, kind and funny.And third, all this gets extremely wasted. For the script is full of tasteless jokes, and the male half of the twosome is designed to be the greatest possible a***. The only thing one really wants after a while is to see him die a very painful death.To make that disaster even more complete, Sean 'Samwise Gamgee' Astin plays a stupid bodybuilder here, who gets kicked in the ass by everyone, including his own father.To me, it looks as if the people making this movie tried to create something like a second 'There's something about Mary'. But in that movie one liked Ted, Mary's admirer, or Warren, Mary's brother, and the Farrelly brothers where great to walk on the slim line between good and tasteless jokes. In 50 First Dates however, one hates the admirer, the brother is a cause for sadness and the jokes make you feel sick.",7,0,0,7 June 2004
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The only Spielberg I really like
","Commenting on this one is maybe a bad idea, for what new thing can I say about it ? But I finally managed to watch Drews first successful movie, so I will just drop another note about it.I've seen quite a lot movies of Spielberg, and I'm definitely not fan of this director. Jaws was boring, Jurassic Park was simply crap, Saving Private Ryan was far too pathetic, and A.I. was boring, crap and pathetic. So I personally don't know why Spielberg is so successful. But this one here works.Good suspense, funny, with sympathy to its figures, and with a positive message, at the same time entertaining for adults and kids. How much better can a movie be ?Okay, it was again pathetic. But it had a lot more story than Saving Private Ryan, and it wasn't pathetic about the US.I don't know the original, so I can't comment on the differences between the original and the directors cut.Recommended unless you consider good entertainment with a positive message a sin.",9,3,5,4 April 2002
Meet the Parents," Hahaha..what?..hahaha... ;-)
","Even reading the title makes me laugh again. How could I criticize a movie while laughing about it ??? Well, I'll try.A guy wants to marry his love - but just one moment before he wants to ask her for it she notes in a subsentence that her father is of the old style and prefers it to be asked for the hands of his daugthers. Oh, no problem, the man thinks, and tries just to do exactly that.And then - oh my god, how can I describe this ? Its just too funny.  Well, in short, the two meet the parents of the woman at a weekend, and its becoming a really horrible one, with one catastrophe just directly following the other.Aaarg, my stomach starts to hurt from all the laughing. Ben Stiller is excellent, Robert DeNiro is of course again an acting god, and the movie is just too good to be true.Recommended.",9,0,0,17 April 2001
Unbreakable," Not really necessary
","Well if one knows 'The sixth Sense', this new movie will be far less surprising.In fact, I had hoped for some other movie, something where Bruce Willis does a little bit play the superhero again, like he had done so often before. That would have just fit into the theme, and would have been really cool. But this movie just stays philosophical, even more than 'The sixth Sense'. Additionally, I liked the end far less.Overall, this wasn't really a necessary movie, and left me quite unhappy. I hope the director will not continue to do the same over and over again, or else I doubt he will be very successful in future.",5,0,0,17 April 2001
Monster," Realistic and depressing
","This is not really a movie one can judge about, as its not entertainment but information and education. If you want to watch it, you really should take your time.They say that Charlize Theron did one of the greatest acting ever in this movie, and indeed I was impressed how completely and perfectly she became a very different person. Unfortunately others here had problems to keep up with her brilliance, most noticeably her movie girlfriend, played by charismatic Christina Ricci.I was also impressed that a movie about a 'Monster' showed not a monster, but instead a very living and understandable human being, tortured by her really horrible life before finally making some really stupid decisions. Indeed, this movie actually contains one of the greatest romantic moments I've ever seen in a movie.I can't help but give this movie full marks and full recommendation.",10,1,1,3 August 2004
The Girl Next Door," Alisha Cuthbert is sweet, but otherwise...
","'American Sexuality' would be the better title for this movie. This is a movie about and exclusively for Americans that make every European yawn - unless of course he is as ignorant, misinformed and puritan as these strange people from overseas.For the movie completely ignores the problems of his theme. These script authors obviously never read any studies about the psychological problems of real prostitutes and pornstars, they never talked with real people of this field, and they're very far behind with the reality of today pornography as well. For example, nobody makes much money with a single porn movie in the internet age anymore. Reading any serious article about the today reality in any political or feminist media would have told you much more than this picture about the problem.Failing on the educational side, the movie isn't entertaining either. It simply lacks real ideas for the story itself, and most attempts to fill the full 90 minutes for a cinema movie look very artificial and don't support any general story. The Hollywood rule 'the story should fit into two sentences' is not followed at all here. I especially disliked it that this movie has not one ending, but about four or so. At multiple stages of the movie every problem was really solved and the end screen could have popped up. Maybe it had even more endings, after the fourth ending I left the cinema out of boredom.",4,1,3,23 November 2004
Spider-Man 2," Now I also like Spiderman 1
","Do you know a really good comic movie ? I really have problems to remember anyone. Batman was bad (especially Batman and Robin), Spawn was harmless, Hulk was not that good, X-Men is improving, but hardly has reached a decent level yet.So Spiderman seems to be the only really good comic movie ever. And the second movie might be even better than the first one. I really have hated the first one for its bad ending, but the second one fixes it for me.Both movies brilliantly combine small, actorcentered scenes with big effects and action. Again Ken Parker, the Spiderman, has a lot of personal troubles to handle. The movie contains a lot of nice scenes and jokes, but of course also the big hunt of another supercriminal.This is the best comic movie known to me, and a very good piece of entertainment.",10,0,0,3 August 2004
The Fifth Element," One of the best SF movies.
","Stanislaw Lem said once, most of the so-called Science Fiction literature is not really SF in his eyes. Because they don't seriously think about how science might develop in future. If you follow his strict advice, neither Star Wars nor The fifth element are true SF movies.However, both pictures are very good entertainment. Too, both are fairy tales, but while Star Wars tries to be serious, contains much magic and pseudoscience, the fifth element looks more like some kind of drug trip.The basic story couldn't be more trashy. Bruce Willis, who is the best soldier of the world seeks the perfect woman and - finds one. Besides he has to fight against some gigantic black hole which is the personalized evil.But this doesn't matter, nay, simply fits. Crazy people (Chris Tucker!), funny dialogues, very much slapstick, good action scenes, sweet romance, very good camera work - there is never a limit. Every scene is made so well, you can simply watch this movie again and again without getting bored.This my second favorite of Bruce Willis, the first one is of course Die hard.",10,0,1,5 November 1999
Blade," Good effects and much fighting, but no horror
","When I saw the first announcement for this film, I thought it must be great (I'm a big Wesley Snipes fan). Seeing the preview lowered my expectations, and the movie itself was a disappointment.It is most of the time nothing but an average action movie, and even if the effects and fighting scenes are good to excellent, the story itself was quite flat and boring, and there was nothing about horror. The vampires were just evil humans with some special abilities, not a symbol of forces or fears in our subconciousness, our animal inside, or of natural forces (such as the pest), or such. The start of the film is the best part of the whole picture; Traci Lords plays Racquel (even if nobody ever calls her with a name in the movie), a vampire woman, which takes a human victim (a man which believes she loves/likes him) to a vampire disco. That whole scene culminates more and more and really makes you shiver - it was a very good start --- until Blade appears and starts the first of the well known boring good hero fights: the good hero kills everybody (i.e. every vampire) and is soooo cool and soooo invinceable and sooooo boring... one of the vampires he kills is Racquel, and later I thought that this was quite symbolical, for she has been the one which had ruled the only really good scene of the movie. The later film never comes back to the level of the start. There are some nice jokes in it (exploding vampire blood etc), and many effects are excellent (but not that strange scene where the blood god is created. that looks just absurd), but the fighting is nothing but the well-known typical unrealistic stuff. In all his films, Wesley Snipes is a natural cool one; but here he _tries_ to be cool all the time, and becomes, of course, very uncool this way.This film has been compared to Spawn, but Spawn is a totally different kind of film; a good family movie where good fights against evil, and good wins. At least that movie was not promising what it cannot keep. Of course, the film about Spawn was very different than the comic; while Blade was really close. But I expect more of a vampire movie, especially if they have such excellent actors, than only an action movie with expensive effects.",2,4,9,1 February 1999
Troy," Little bit bombastic entertainment with good acting
","Troy is a film with very, very good dialogues and a lot of brilliant actors. I especially liked Sean Bean aka Boromir as Odysseus, but Priam, Hector, Archilles, Briseis, Agamemnon and many others where very good as well.
The effects where also very good, even if they where a little bit bombastic at times. But the actors and the story still got most of the screentime.The original story has been modified very much, but thats not a bad thing, because this way the movie isn't just a mechanical repetition. Of course, many important scenes are now left out, and some things happen at a different time. And the movie story contains now almost no gods anymore, except that some people still believe very much in them and Archilles is told that he will die in Troy.I've been told that this movie and 'The day after tomorrow' are in concurrence to each other, as both Peterson ('Das Boot') and Emmerich ('Independence Day') are directors from germany. But in my humble opinion, Troy is the much better one of these two.Troy is a good entertainment movie and I think I can recommend it.",8,0,1,8 June 2004
X-Men," A mayor disappointment
","Maybe I just expected too much from this movie. I expected the ultracool Matrix-Feeling, a powerful mixture of suspense and coolness, a extremely good arrangement, cool modern music, styling and all that.What I got was an average movie :-(Well the looks are cool. But unlike the title and theme suggest, there are not many fights, and all coolness is, well, carelessly destroyed again and again. This movie is too calm, too friendly, to actor-centralized. The actors are very good, not to say ideal - but this movie lacks simply style. Not in the outfit, but in the way it was managed. This isn't really an action movie. It has the looks but it concentrates far too much on the characterization of the people, namely the mutants.I'm very surprised that it gets that good comments here on IMDB. I had been very frustrated of this movie, and I all people I have asked said the same. I can't give a recommendation for anyone. Maybe people which didn't saw the Matrix before will be happy with this movie quality, but I'm not.",Null,0,0,18 September 2000
Resident Evil: Extinction," Pure suspense and action
","I was really not expecting that much from this movie - I just expected a followup to the previous ones. Especially since the producers hid the movie from the press, a move I can really not understand now, and since the last movie of Milla Jovovich, Ultraviolet, got horrible press and never was shown in any theater near me at all.But I have to say this movie exceeded my expectations and turned out to be really suspenseful and full of atmosphere, and overall a lot better than the previous one. Milla Jovovich is cooler than ever. The story is a lot more straightforward as well, and the action and fights could have been hardly better. Like all good action movies, it also contained humor, which, in this case, was rather black.It was however a bit sad that you had to know the previous movies to really understand this one and to fully comprehend all story twists, and I missed a bit the link between the last movie and this one.Its a good straightforward action movie, I can only recommend it.",9,1,2,19 October 2007
Sleepy Hollow," An absolute must-see
","This is a fairy tale which should make you shudder. Instead, one often has to laugh because it is so funny. The acting was marvelous, even in the smaller roles. The movie had also very much style, it looked dark and dusty all the time. I loved it.I was a little bit nerved for I had to look at a handsome guy (Johnny Depp) all the time, even if he acted very good. And I didn't understand why the character of Mr. Depp, Ichabod Crane, often knew what to do, even if he believes in science and logic and had to fight against spiritual things. But that are of course not real arguments against this movie.I believe this is an absolute must see. But prepare yourself to see many heads cut in this movie !",10,0,0,14 March 2000
American Beauty," A true masterpiece
","One of the movies which are hard to comment upon. Its everything. Its very realistic, it comments upon the way of life, it is very, very poetical, also sexy sometimes, it is very funny, and well, its also a little bit absurd. And it has only excellent actors. But where to start to describe it ?The main story is about a man which feels like dead. There is nothing left; his wife and daughter think he's a loser, and he himself has no idea anymore why he's living. Then he falls in love to one of the school friends of his daughter... but thats only the start of the main story thread.The whole movie is full of interesting scenes where different aspects of life are shown. This movie is simply operating. Unlike 'Snow Falling on Cedars' or 'The Cider House Rules', this is really a movie about life, and doesn't taste like an artificial philosophical statement.I think teenagers should watch different movies; or if they watch this they should realize that it has not been made for them. But everyone else should watch it; its definitely worth your time and money.",10,0,0,10 May 2000
Save the Last Dance," Nice, decent, and better than expected
","Well in fact the only reason for me to enter this movie was just that there was nothing better around. And well - I hoped to hear some new, cool, interesting, good black music in it.There wasn't any, just some nice standard stuff already heart before; but the acting was very good, and the script was also not too bad, which made the movie still quite enjoyable. The skinny, very paleskinned Julia Stiles fit optimally into her role, I especially liked it how good she was able to express her troubles with her mothers death. I liked the acting of everybody else in this movie, too. I'm not able to judge how good or bad the dancing was, but at least it was not too bad.In the sum, it was a very nice movie, better than I had thought, but it was as decent as I had thought. If you want to have some excitement, better watch something else.",1,4,11,23 March 2001
The Fast and the Furious," Indeed a wellmade macho movie ! And, as such, simply perfect.
","This movie was exactly what I expected, a macho movie. For that, it was indeed very, very good ! Just like the trailer looked.It had even a little bit of a story, which I didn't expected at all, people had charisma and personality (even the women), the script had good dialogues and some very good jokes, and there where quite a lot of really good stunts and effects.I felt well entertained. And I really loved the funny and friendly end.Perfect ! I really liked it, even if thats not really the type of movie I favor.",8,1,1,24 October 2001
The Exorcist," Maybe I've expected too much
","Well this movie is called genial and so on, but in fact, it wasn't that exciting to me. My reference for movies like this is still 'Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)', and 'The Exorcist' cannot at all be compared to that one.It is simply far to explicit, and works with direct effects, instead of giving you a feeling of horror without any escape. When the people leave the room with the child, the devil simply has no more influence on them, and when they're in the room, I missed a lot of interesting psychological fights. In fact, when the exorcism itself starts, the end comes soon and suddenly, and left me quite dissatisfied.The movie has however a very good development in suspense. The beginning was simply perfect, with a very subtle danger, and everything could still be well explained. But then the movie becomes too less subtle, even if it still remains on a high level.Another major weakness in the movie was the fact, that one of the exorcists works as a psychologist, and is called a very good one multiple times during the movie, but behaves like anyone but a person with high psychological intelligence.I don't like most horror movies in general, and I did an exception to watch this one, but it was not really worth it. 'The Blair Witch Project (1999)' offered more realism, 'The Negotiator (1998)' offered a far, far better psychology.",8,0,1,6 April 2001
Remember the Titans," Even people which don't like sport may enjoy this !
","I'm not the type of person which enjoys sport in general. And most movies of this type bore me endlessly.Not so this one. Its really entertaining. The different aspects of sport occur all in it, and the typical problems of people doing sport, but they are not at all everything the movie has to offer. Instead we also get many political aspects and personal conflicts. The people here are not stereotypes, nobody is just purely good or just purely evil, and not all questions about them are answered by the movie, just like in real life.This movie has a message, it has a story, and it has very good acting. I don't know a reason why I shouldn't recommend it.",Null,0,0,30 March 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Highly overrated, but still good.
","After such supermovies this year, like 'Shrek' and 'le fabuleux destin d'AmÃ©lie Poulain' (Amelie from Montmatre), claiming that this nice but decent movie is the years best one sounds simply absurd in my ears. I have to admit that this movie not even succeeded to be my favorite of the week !No question, the singing is okay, dialogue is good, and there are quite some nice jokes in it. But the movie does basically nothing but bathing the watcher in cliche, telling him or her such well hidden secrets such as 'there is nothing more important than love'. I really often felt quite bored by that.And the environment embarrassed me. The Moulin Rouge is actually nothing but a brothel in Paris ! A place where rich old men buy poor young girls. A prison. A shame for mankind. Whatever. But in the movie, it is treated with a glory as if it would be a kings palace !Too, many story parts couldn't raise my interest at all. The whole part with the jealously could, if at all, make me laugh. Whats the point there ? The man should have known that he is fallen into a whore ! What did he expect ? That she immediately transforms into an angel now ?In the end, 'Moulin Rouge' is nothing but a female counterpart to 'Fast and Furious'. Instead of action you get song and dance, and instead of coolness and freedom you get romance. But I liked the far more realistic characters from 'Fast and Furious' more than these boring stereotypes from 'Moulin Rouge'.",6,0,1,24 October 2001
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," action movie, not very original
","Unlike the first movie, the second one is a pure action movie for the masses. Development of an atmosphere or even worse emotional development of the characters was completely not considered by the makers of the movies, on the other hand they easily sacrificed any piece of story logic for having another cool pose of their main characters. As a result, the story has holes as large as moon craters and a development like the shambling of a drunk. The movie beginning is very artificial and the movie climax very cheesy and wordy. Still, the movie has quite some nice action scenes and over long distances also suspense.I can't really recommend it, the predecessor was a lot more spooky and original.",7,0,0,19 October 2007
The Mummy Returns," Too entertaining
","The top line might sound absurd, but thats exactly my problem with this movie.It is just too much mainstream. Plenty of good jokes, good action, very good effects, very good design of the sets, good actors and everything, its all there. But on the other hand, the movie nearly never lets you breath, jumping from one event to the next without any pause, the story never really surprises, the characters lack any characterization, its just fun and action, action and fun.Following the mainstream is not in general a bad idea, but in this case there is nothing but mainstream, and in this extreme form it is really boring.",7,0,0,21 May 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Simply GREAT !!!! :-)
","After reading the book, the first question that comes in mind about a movie about it is: what for ? Why should anyone want to watch the movie after reading the book ?This was my first and foremost question, before I even saw the actual movie. With it I walked watching the actual picture, and it certainly had an answer for it.Where should I start ? Where stop ?The cast to Harry Potter is simply unbelievable good, the primus inter pares of strengths of this movie. Harry, Hermione, Ron and Hagrid simply got the right actors, which fit to their roles as perfectly natural as Angelina Jolie to Lara Croft ('Tomb Raider'), or Hugh Jackman to Wolvenrine ('X-Men'). And that in four roles at the same time ! Snape got Alan Rickman ('Galaxy Quest', 'Dogma' etc), which looks only like a very bad choice until you've seen him, words are simply not enough to describe his simply genial acting here ! Definitely the best actor of the movie, which had no lack of good actors. The rest of the cast was extremely well chosen, and well acted, too. If at all, Dudley wasn't fat enough, and his role was far more aggressive than in the book, and well I always thought of Draco as being far more charismatic.The other parts of the movie was just as good. Acting was very good to brilliant, directing etc was good, effects where wonderful: for example, Quidditch matches looked as real as they possibly could, even if I would have liked to see some more uses of slow motion here. A specialist told me that the sorting hat wasn't completely perfect, but I didn't noticed that (except that it was definitely smaller than in the book).After seeing the movie for the first time, I was a little bit surprised that Daniel Radcliffe get bad comments from some people. I've checked this again when seeing the movie the second time, and I definitely and wholeheartedly disagree. Harry looks a little stunned at the start of the movie, but thats what one would expect - he tries not to get the attention of the Dursleys, plus they don't care about his feelings, and then Hagrid comes and tells him he is a wizard ! Harry's acting is just right at these places, I cannot imagine it done better.The same goes for anyone commenting bad on either Ron or Hermione. These three are all simply natural ! Just look at real children, they don't have a broader set of expressions either. It is just like it should be.Other people comment that the movie is just too faithful to the book, and that that is 'boring'. I strongly disagree, I don't want to see a movie about the book where some 'genius' has changed the plot. That would be completely annoying, upset me, and makes no sense. And, for example, do you ever remember a bad comment about a Shakespeare movie because they stick to the original plot ?The real problem of the movie was time famine. Many funny parts of the book where left out, and many scenes, especially at the start, where simply too short to include the humor of the original book. To really understand and enjoy the movie, one REALLY should have read the book before !And that was also the answer to my question at the start: this movie is finally incomplete, it cannot replace the reading, but it can give you the pictures you had on the inside while reading it again, and faithfully.GREAT !!! I've seen it three times now, and I plan to see it again !",9,0,0,4 December 2001
The Green Mile," Nice little movie with many acting giants
","Tom Hanks was the main character in my absolute favorite of the 90's - 'Forrest Gump'. This is his new movie. But - a killer with healing abilities ? Sounds really idiotic, doesn't it ? On the other hand, reading the list of fabulous actors which are in it might change one's opinion before watching it, and the movie itself has some really seldom qualities which makes it very, very enjoyable.The acting here is simply marvelous. It is emotionally correct. It clearly demonstrates Mr. Hanks' (and many others!) abilities to transport emotions onto the screen. It was very nice to notice these little details - how he talked without words with his friend, how he acted in the different situations. In fact, he doesn't express feelings very often, but he really knows how to make you feel what his character feels. On the other hand, the script is often also very funny, often the people in the cinema laughed long and loud.Well there is not only light. The healing scenes are simply bad, just like the basic script idea. The reasons why the healer got sentenced to death were unrealistic. In fact, some little logical holes were really obvious.And the evil characters in this script - damned, they were played so excellently that I really couldn't stand them at all. Well this is not really a disadvantage, but I prefer movies with less brutal people in it.This movie would not have received much praise without the names of Mr. Hanks and the well-known author of the original book. Its design is too 'little'. Excellent actors alone have never been enough for a movie to succeed. But in this case, I think the name Hanks will be enough, and I think this movie will be nominated for the Oscar.",8,0,0,4 February 2000
Shrek," An absolute topmovie
","Believable and complex characters, a really original story, filled up with good jokes (many are too hard to understand for children), including tons of suspense and romance - this is a masterpiece !Without any problems it raises to the level of the best movies ever, including the other anime supermovies 'Toy Story II' and 'Chicken Run', or movies such as 'American Beauty', 'Titanic' or 'Matrix'.A topmovie. Maybe the best movie of the year. Absolutely recommended !!",10,0,0,3 September 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," Excellent slapstick - for adults !
","I doubt that many children will understand all the humor of this story. As an adult, one can keep laughing during the whole movie. Its really a wellmade, humorous, funny artpiece.Fortunately there is the name 'Disney' to help it, so it had a chance in cinema. I would give respect to any other company which would have made this movie, but only Disney has the name to be successful with movies like this in cinema, as it seems - and even in the case of Disney not always, as the failure of the unbelievable masterpiece 'Toy Story 2' has proved.Well, this is Disney at its best, very good family entertainment for both children and adults, also plus some moral - a really good movie, worth your time !",9,1,2,17 April 2001
Beowulf," boring and predictable
","Its really seldom that a movie is as predictable as this one. You already know the whole story of this picture if you saw its trailer. The rest is hardly more but a lot of chatting and a little fighting. And - thats it ! No sub-context, no story twists, no comedy, no irony, nothing.And the new technology of making movies is awful. Its tolerable if human skin looks rather like marzipan. But its a huge problem when most faces are simply lifeless and unnatural. Even the main characters faces ! The only exception is Angelina Jolie, because she's the only one who kept mostly her original face.Another thing which really nerved me was the absurd prudery of the movie. We see a man fighting naked, but somehow there is always something in the way that hides his penis. We get Angelina Jolie all naked, but she has breasts without nipples. If the creators of the movie didn't wanted to show naked people, they should have just kept their characters dressed, instead of such embarrassing trickery.No recommendation. This picture wont make you want to poke out your eyes, but thats the best I can say about it.",3,3,7,4 December 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Good Action, but lacks a bit in respect to the basics
","The fourth 'Die Hard' movie is certainly OK as a pure action movie. Tons of explosions, cool stuns, etc. And its quite funny, too. And they have Kevin Smith !The problem I had with it was that I couldn't sympathize with the people in the movie enough, as they totally lacked any deeper characterization. They have no mentionable motives, no habits, and no faults. Besides being sometimes hungry, being interested in girls if they are boy and vice versa, and being angry if you hurt people they love, etc.In movie one there was a policeman from new york where coming to 'fucking California', made fists with his toes, etc. There where a lot of details that describe the people and make them complete and real. The evil guys also had a lot of characterization, and there where a lot of psychological battles going on between them and the cop.In movie four all these basics are missing. As a result, one never really has any relation to the people on the screen, dialogs are shallow, and many scenes simply don't work.A final word of criticism: when will Hollywood ever make a movie about computers thats even only decently realistic ? Most people have computers now at home but Hollywood movies continue to be absurd whenever computers are mentioned.All in all, its a nice mainstream movie, but its certainly not another classic.",4,0,1,15 July 2007
Cube," AAAAAAAAAAAAARG!!!!!
","I've read that this should be a 'cult movie' but I'm sorry its one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And the comments of other people in the cinema said the same.I'm surprised there are actors on this earth which are able to speak such dialogues without starting to cry. They are so horrible, such a mass of stereotypes and so completely pathetic, I couldn't believe it.The story is completely idiotic. A number of people is caught in a labyrinth and seeks the exit. Ah, and some of them have to die because there are dangerous traps in some rooms. What is the sense for that story ?? Being the frame for those dialogues ???This movie is ideal for tortures and sadists, but not for watching it by themselves.",1,12,25,6 July 2000
The Wedding Singer," My favorite of 1998 - simply genial
","This is IMHO the best film of the year 1998. I've seen it five times in cinema (during the 2 or 3 weeks it was running). Every scene is very carefully, if not to say genially designed, the film is filled up with wonderful situation jokes (old woman sings rap, a boy-george-like man which weeps because the marriage of his friends is stopped in the last minute, and very very much like that). Drew Barrymore didn't acted like a toy (as she has looked like often before), but like an admirable beautiful young woman here.The shortest way to describe the movie would be 'Titanic without the disaster' (or with a happy end). The evil rich man which wants to own the girl, the unknown artist which falls in love to the girl, the girl not knowing for a while who of these two she should marry, and the 'historical' environment (even if the eighties are no so far away than the Titanic disaster) - all remembers of Titanic. And even if Adam Sandler surely isn't as handsome as Leonardo DiCaprio (while Drew and Kate are both true beauties), he and Drew acted in the same juvenile, sympathetical, congenial way as Leo and Kate. So there are many analogies between these two movies, while the Wedding Singer is, for me, the better one, with less action but more creativity and fun, more focus on interesting characters and, last not least, the far better music.",10,0,1,12 February 1999
