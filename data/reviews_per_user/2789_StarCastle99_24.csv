Catch Me If You Can," An Affecting Good Time Movie Experience
","Who says Steven Spielberg can't make a movie without 'scope'. This is one fine movie going experience and a great yarn. Leo di Caprio gives an honest performance, but he can't hold a candle to Tom Hanks. Tom has a special appeal, which is why he's Tom Hanks. The most amazing thing about the film is that it is based on a true story. Thankfully, Christopher Walken supplies Leo with some interesting motivation for becoming 'The Great Pretender'. Earlier in his career, the knock on Spielberg was he was a director of spectacle; not an actor's director like Sydney Pollock. That just isn't the case. His abilities have matured, as has the man. This was an entertaining movie about an incredible character. Just the right fare for New Years Day!",10,0,1,1 January 2003
Minority Report," A Self Indulgent Film Largely Inaccessible to the Movie Goer
","First, I'm a filmmaker, but I'm not Steven Spielberg.  I recognize he holds a revered position in the Industry.  As Steven knows, not every film is going to be an ET or CE3K or Jaws.  Those films were driven by great stories punctuated with superb (for their time) special visual effects.  Don't believe me, read the writings of William Goldman, argueably one of the best screenwriters of our era.  Without a story, you don't have a movie. Phil Dick is one fine writer, but his stories don't always translate into screenplays. The same is true of Isaac Asimov. Only one of his 458 novels was ever a hit movie (The Fantastic Voyage). So Steven makes up for a twisted, swiss cheese of a plot with lots of eye candy, even virtual sets. Now, to Tom Cruise.  His recent remarks about America aside, he is probably the weakest bankable actor on the 'A' list.  The only film, in his filmography, that has ever stretched him as an actor was 'Born on the Fourth of July'. I believe he was stretched by the material and director Oliver Stone. He is simply not on a par with Mel Gibson, Russell Crowe, or even the mature John Travolta.  His performances are rather unidimensional, and he fails to give his characters much in the way of nuance.I'm as big a fan of Steven Spielberg as any, but I'm not a naif who says he loves everything he ever did.  Steven had his stinkeroo(s); we all do.  Does anybody remember 'Howard the Duck' (George Lucas).This film gets 4/10 for its visuals and audio design.  Story - no, direction (take away the Louma Crane, Wescam and Steady Cam) and it falls flat. Moreover, I think this was Steven's most self indulgent exercise in filmmaking. Come on Steven, you can do better and you don't need Mr. Cruise. Kudos to Gerald Mollen for keeping this runaway train on track.",Null,0,0,4 July 2002
Citizen Kane," A Work of Genius That Some People Love to Hate
","Ask yourself the question: who makes a film like this as their first effort? The answer: only a genius, perhaps a flawed one. Beginning with The Cradle Will Rock and the Mercury Radio Theater, Welles simply overwhelms the careers of his peers. Never underestimate the contribution of Greg Tolin, his deep focus work and dutch angles add a feeling of scale and panorama. Movies are made of moments. Say the word 'Rosebud' and what else can you think of but Kane? Is it the greatest? That's like trying to figure out who was the greatest baseball player or football figure. Greatness is like a butterfly, hard to pin down. Well, compared to another epic of its era, 'Gone With the Wind', it makes that well thought of film look like a Soap Opera.  Kane is a film that delivers something new everytime you see it. Like a Russian Doll, there are layers and layers.  Okay, maybe you don't want to intellectualize entertainment, but this film transcends entertainment.  Like the best of Shakespeare it gets into the human soul. The result is that it is truth and truth is never dated, nor is it bounded on the east by Eastport. This film should be preserved forever. As a filmmaker, I would be overjoyed to write, produce or direct anything half as good. Frankly, I don't think you can compare Kane to any other film.  By the way, the Soundtrack by Bernie Hermann was recast into a Classical Suite, 'Welles Raises Kane'. Everybody gave 110% to this picture. I wonder if Orson Welles life would have turned out differently, if he hadn't peaked on his first film.",10,0,1,29 May 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Prepare for a Great Ride
","Whoever the genius is that decided to make a movie out of a Disneyland ride, instead of the other way around, thank you. This movie is a ride. Don't look for anything other than a lot of action, fun, a few funny lines, and a riveting performance by Johnny Depp. Costuming, sets, music, sound all deserve nominations. This is Depps best performance. He's an actor I respect because he's willing to expose his career to off beat roles. His supporting cast, including Orlando Bloom is fine, but this is clearly Depp's movie. Enjoy it, like you would snack food. For me, it's the most watchable film of the summer. Good cross-over should mash it past the $200,000,000 mark with ease. It leaves itself open for a sequel, but I don't know how Jerry Bruckheimer would top it. The summer belongs to Disney. After five losing years they are back at the top of the ziggurat. Congratulations, Michael, you teamed up with a winner and a winner is what you got. Can't wait for the 'making of' DVD.",9,0,2,3 August 2003
The Hustler," Jackie Gleason Steals Movie from Paul Newman
","For those of us brought up on 'The Jackie Gleason Show' and especially 'The Honeymooners', we thought of 'The Great One' as a gifted comedic actor. Imagine our shock when we discovered he was a world class dramatic actor. His portrayal of Minnesota Fats ranks as one of the great acting turns in motion picture history.  Watch Gleason carefully. No mugging, no great elastic face, no punchlines, only total believability. We always knew he could play pool. It is a fact that some of the shots were done by the great Willie Masconi. Forget that, Gleason plays a one-of-a-kind character coupled with the era's hottest mail star.  Perhaps women swooned at the sight of Paul Newman, but Gleason walked away with the Oscar.  This could have been a television drama taken to the screen, ala 'Marty', but the era of live television drama had passed.  Jackie Gleason is simply amazing. Those who knew him said he was larger than life. A/B this title with 'The Color of Money' and I defy you to say the later version was better. It couldn't have been. The Great One didn't appear.  BTW: Check out Soldier in the Rain as Gleason stretches his acting ability even more.  Again he's teamed with a hunk of his era (Steve McQueen) and again he steals the picture. WOW!",10,3,4,3 June 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," The Mother of All Disaster Pictures and one of the worst
","Look, let's get one thing straight. This isn't a movie. It's a blog on the questionable issue of global warming. Frankly, climatologists will tell you they know less about the science than Larry Flynn knows about good taste. In fact, my friends at NASA tells me there is no science here so it's just a work of fiction, meant to capture your attention, for those of you who know no science, an attempt to jump on the Al Gore bandwagon. You remember Al Gore, the man who told us he in invented the internet.This is a political season. The concepts put before you simply have no basis in science. The producers had a political agenda and it shows like a pretty girl in a celophane nightgown. The real truth is that periodic warming and cooling of the atmosphere has been going on for 4.5 billion years, and that predates Al Gore and the Internet. If you want to believe this picture is an acceptable depiction of global warning than please call me because I have a well known bridge to show you.Wolfgang, you stole Dead Zone from Lynda, and made a mush of it.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Where Has All the Fun Gone?
","The first Star Wars (now known as 4) hit like a hammer.  Never had anybody seen such spectacular effect work, so well integrated into an imaginative movie.  That was 1977.  I can't believe that George Lucas thought it would be ever taken as seriously today, since the lines were a goofy mix of Flash Gordon and Lost Planet Airman.Today, there is literally nothing we can't do with CGI. And George does it, and it gets in the way of the story.  Lucas has wrapped three pictures in the 'Coming of the Empire' cloak, so we know that SW-3 will not turnout happy.  Anniken must become Darth Vader.I wonder if the same thing that happened to Star Trek will happen to Star Wars.  As you recall, Star Trek: The Next Generation had a spectacular run on television.  The next Star Trek series, Deep Space Nine was static by comparison, and revolved around politics and personalities.  Action was limited by the concept, and as a result has never been the financial success of ST:TNG.As a hyphenate, I know how difficult it is to write a prequel.  Writing a trilogy of them is a nightmare.  Call me old fashioned, but if the original Star Wars film with its feelings of bon hommie at the end, had ended the series, I would have been just as happy.  On the other hand, you don't stop milking a cow, until she kicks over the bucket.",7,0,0,19 June 2002
Forrest Gump," Films Just Don't Get Any Better Than This
","Just had the honor of revisiting simply one of the best movies ever made, Forest Gump. What more can you ask for? Bob Zemeckis directs a film that will, in some form, live forever. Tom Hanks gives, in my opinion, the best acting performance since 1994. Alan Silvestri's music soars, while the songs of the era remind us of the times of our lives. I make films and television shows for a living. I wonder if I'll ever make a film as good as this. My thanks to everybody who worked on this classic.

The Matrix Revolutions," Ugh - The Case Against Sequels
","Having written a three part novel, it is my firm belief that before the writer begins the first novel, he or she should have a firm idea of how the third novel will end, as well as the connective tissue that holds the three together. I don't care what the Warschawsky's Press Agent would have you believe, but when the first Matrix was completed and awaiting release, nobody was thinking sequels - and it shows. There are some movies that deserve to stand up as one time only. The first Matrix was a ground breaker in look and f/x. The next two were boring high budget films which require a cheat sheet to keep track of the plot.The best that one can say, is if given the choice of producing large scale crowd effects, the job should go to WEDA. Their software is positively awesome. As for the Reloaded and Revolutions, they are clinkers, pure and simple. A good rule of thumb: if a movie relies on special effects more than cinematic story telling, it means there is no story, and the movie isn't worth your valuable time.",1,3,5,18 December 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A Great Ride but T-2 is still the one to beat
","Science Fiction like Jello comes in many flavors. T-1 was an amazing film in that it looked like five times the budget. T-2 set new standards in Special Effects and a time travel narrative that eluded to quantum time theory (that is the future doesn't exist, we create it millisecond by millisecond). Both films featured great action set pieces. T-3 is a wonderful way to spend 109 minutes (thank goodness it was no three hour LOTR). It's a bit dumbed down, the film makers knew their demographics and didn't try to over-reach. If you like the other Terminators, you'll totally enjoy this one. Arnold is, well, Arnold. He is a one of a kind and all the others are pretenders. I know the man personally. He is as intelligent and thoughtful an individual as you will ever meet. But no one wants to see that Arnold on the screen. They want 'I'll be baaack'. Yesterday I watched the first two films to prepare me for this one. I knew what to expect. I wasn't disappointed. If there is a 4th sequel don't expect Arnold to be in it. At 55 he's in the words of Danny Glover: 'Too old for this ----.' The other players are adequate, but no one ever gets as passionate as Linda Hamilton in T-2. SPFX were excellent, they've had 12 years to benefit from five new generations of CGI equipment. My advice. Go see it. It's great fun. Please don't take it seriously, the cast doesn't. The only one's who do are the bean counters at the studio, and with $175 million dollar budget who can blame them. 7.9/10",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
The Princess Bride," A Classic That Will Be Loved Forever
","Sometimes, when renting a DVD, I'm surprised to find a gem, that I missed on its original run. Rob Reiner's 'Princess Bride' is one of those. For it's duration, I was transported to my childhood, and watched a dream play out on the screen.The film on its original release was badly marketed. If one of my films had been butchered that way, I would have been screaming to the rooftops. To his credit, Rob Reiner did not strangle the head of Business Affairs at Fox.This movie is pure storytelling by the premier screenwriter of our time, directed by an actor's director. It's hard to believe Reiner brought it in at $15 million.  He is admittedly not a special effects wizard, ala Lucas, but nevermind. Each of his films has been something special, and in my opinion, Reiner hasn't received the recognition that some of his peers have enjoyed.It's not surprising that a son of Carl and Estelle Reiner should have a spark of genius himself.After renting the movie, I bought two copies. One goes in my collection. The other I put into storage at a Los Angeles Film Vault. When my daughter has children, that pristine copy is meant for them.Seldom has a movie had such cross over that adults and children love it. Although it failed to turn a profit at the box office, I trust later incarnations in VHS and DVD have remedied that. Today, our children read fairy tales that go back centuries.  I would be very surprised if some 23rd century viewer wasn't charmed by this film no matter what the media.  Bravo to the actors, the writer, the producer and director.  Yes and to Norman Lear, who footed the bill. You did yourselves proud.",10,1,2,31 May 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Best Pure Filmmaking I've Ever Seen
","Saving Private Ryan is simply the best pure filmmaking I've ever encountered in a lifetime in the Biz.  The Normandy sequences use every technique possible to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, and maybe hiding their heads.  Spielberg uses solarization and strobing combined with hand-held shots to put the viewer in the living hell of the invasion.  The story, the characters, rung true. This is the way people were before PC and during WWII. Ethnicities that seem exaggerated, were very much in evidence at that time and Spielberg wasn't about to make a post-modern war picture. This is Sands of Iwo Jima / Guadalcanal Diary but realistically portrayed. It made one think if they would be so brave as to ride those tiny LST's to the beach, knowing what was waiting for them.For those who wonder why it didn't win Best Picture, I say, wake up! Do you think the Academy is a pure democracy?  Is it not possible that other less talented members are simply jealous of the consistently fine work that has put Steven Spielberg atop his profession?  Academy Awards are simply the product of the likes and dislikes of each member of the Motion Picture Academy - nothing more.  They weren't handed down from Mt. Sinai and anybody who believes the world is a fair place should open their eyes.  10/10 ***** An experience.",Null,0,1,20 June 2002

2001: A Space Odyssey," A Magnificent Epic That's Terribly Misunderstood
","Okay, I've read enough viewer comments and can't contain myself. I'm a writer and a filmmaker.  I'd like to know where it is written that a film has to explain itself to you.  I saw 2001 when it first opened. I was with five other people.  We discussed the film for two hours.  When was the last time that happened?  For those of you who felt it was slow, so is space travel.  Get it! There ain't no Warp Factor 1. Secondly, the ending: has nobody ever read anything by Arthur C. Clarke? One of the recurring themes in Clarke's work is that any civilization sufficiently advanced over humankind would seem like Magic, or even Gods.  If you didn't understand the ending, perhaps you weren't supposed to.  Isn't it possible that Kubrick was giving you the experience of how clueless we would all be if confronted by an intelligence millions of years ahead of us.  Look, opinions are like rear ends, everybody has them, but when people put this film down as garbage or the equivalent, it tells me that they aren't thinking it through. Television and motion pictures are very passive media.  They supply you with 100% of audio and video.  Old time radio forced the listener to be imaginative and conjure up the picture. Surprisingly, it's not difficult to do that at all. Here is a film that dares to be somewhere between radio and the visual media.  It doesn't hand you all the answers on a silver platter.  Like a really good computer game you have to figure them out. Whether you liked it or not is your decision. Enough very knowledable people in the film world have viewed it and deemed it one of the great masterpieces of film. As many have said, it's an experience. If you can't deal with that, then go back to your five pages and a boink pacing, but dissing this film is a bit like saying Mozart didn't know squat about music. An opinion like that only make you look bad.",10,15,31,29 May 2002
National Treasure," Pop Corn Movie not to be take seriously
","National Treasure could have been a quasi-Indiana Jones film, but the story had more holes than a prairie dog metropolis, the dialog was lame, the acting was wooden (n-1 dimensional), and basically the flaws could only be compensated by lots of noise and plenty of boinks. This film reminds me a little of Disney's 'Black Hole'. Great concept, horrific execution. Where is the production supervision? How can a Jerry Buckheimer film get re-edited down to 100 minutes and come out so vanilla? If you're wondering why it finished ahead of Sponge Bob Square Pants I can think of two reasons. People were ready for a more adult movie (ha ha) and much of Sponge Bob's following is too young to go to the movies. I give this a five for a good sound design, and a one for everything else. Ugh.",Null,0,0,23 November 2004
Titanic," A Superb Bit of Filmmaking That Not Everybody Understands
","Filmmaking 101: Every well constructed screenplay should have three elements. A plot, a sub-plot and a sub-text. In the case of Titanic, about 95% of the viewers understood the plot. Perhaps as many understood the subplot, but perhaps 1 in a 1,000 really got the subtext which is the underpinnings of the film.The plot: An unsinkable ship hits an iceberg and sinks with great loss of life. The subplot: a love story, which needed to be added to capture the teenage crowd, which, like it or not, is the prime audience of movie goers. In addition, without the subplot, all you have is a documentary, rather than a fine drama.The subtext, however, may have been the most important part of the film. It's about the classicism that existed in the early 20th century and to some extent is still around.  Did you notice that life boats were available only to the first class passengers.  Indeed those traveling steerage, mostly immigrants, were locked into their deck and doomed to a watery grave.  If there's a message inherent in Titanic, it isn't that we should build better ships.  We already do.  With Global Positioning Satellites only the most negligent Captain would ever collide with an iceberg.  It also isn't about the immortality of love.  Anybody who has loved and lost knows as much about that subject as any picture could ever convey.No, the message is: we are all human beings and deserve to be treated equally, whether rich or poor, regardless of race or religion. That message is as fresh today as it was when the unsinkable ship plunged to its watery grave.Perhaps, the next time you see a good movie, you'll think more about the sub-text and ask yourself what this film is really trying to say.  The answer maybe worth more than the price of admission.8.5/10",Null,2,3,8 June 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," A Phenomenal Sequel That Never Fails to Disappoint
","First let me make it clear that I loved the original Matrix. It's opening should be watched by every film student as to how to hook an audience. The Reloaded version tried to pull out all the stops, f/x and philosophy. As a piece of pure film making it is in a class of its own. As a movie I would watch multiple times it falls short. Why? Well, the story gets bogged down in its own circuitous philosophy. What is real and what is memorex was dealt with nicely by French Philosopher Rene Descartes. I think therefore I am. Also the Socratic dialog wears thin after about thirty seconds. You can't continue dialog when nobody makes a statement. Frankly, the whole movie reminded me of a Salvador Dali painting. Interesting, but you wouldn't want to hang it over your bed. Keeanu Reeves minimalist star turn gets boring, when he isn't beating the snot out of Mr. Smith clones. The freeway sequence makes Steve McQueen's Bullitt look like a game of paddy cake, but there's so much mingling of real and CGI that anybody with a lick of intelligence knows you're looking at an impossible sequence. It all reminds me of the age old show business legend about the actor who believes the stories fed to the papers by his own press agent. As I left the theater, I think my own misgivings were summed up by a woman who asked her partner, 'It was an incredible movie, but what was it about?' Her partner responded, 'If you have to ask the question then you will never know the answer.' I think they should both chill out on a smoothie and have a good night's sleep. The rating is overblown by the fans. I give it a 6 on a scale of ten. It will make a lot of money, but in the end it was merely sound and fury signifying nothing.",4,0,0,16 May 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," An Over The Top Extravaganza of Special Effects
","Okay, if you love Harry Potter nothing I say will matter. Speaking as a filmmaker, this is a film that exists to showcase the f/x. The actors, with the exception of the lead, are so far over the top to be laughable. Kids will probably love the film. Adults will find the 2:40 MTV pacing to be exhausting. This is probably the last of the Harry Potter films I will personally see, because there is tremendous pressure on Chris Columbus and the rest of the team to continually outdo the previous films. If the next one paces any faster, the result will be kinesthetic seizures. Sorry kids, but films are ultimately about acting and story.

The Terminal," Spielberg and Hanks - It's Magic Time
","Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks may just be the best director/star team going. Once again they light up the screen with a terrific quirky portrayal of a man stranded at JFK because his country no longer exists. Hanks character is mesmerizing as he goes from a 'not acceptable' to the hero of this city within a city. Spielberg, as usual, has crafted a superb visual experience. His patented crane shots sweeps the architecture of the Terminal, giving us an extraordinary view of this world within a circle. John Williams score once again proves he is the dean of film composers. All in all, this is the best film I've seen this year. Hanks gives an Oscar level performance, Spielberg will undoubtedly be on this year's DGA ballot. This picture could shine come next year. Further it is just the kind of film to weather the summer box office, where one blockbuster after another is knocking each other off top dog spot. This film has legs! 10/10",10,1,2,21 June 2004
Signs," The Emperor Has No Clothes
","Every few years a young director comes around and everybody raves. A few years ago it was Quentin Tarrantino, before that David Lynch. Now everyone is excited by this latest flavor (who incidentally sports a directing style highly influenced by David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock). Sorry, Mel is one of my favorite actors, this role stretched his repetoir even more. I can't figure out why he did it. One reviewer, more perspecacious than most, understood the film was about the redemption of Mel's faith, but for goodness sake, that was the subtext of the film and only about ten percent of viewers ever understand the subtext of a complex film. But first, you must have a good compelling story and sorry, but it wasn't there.  Watching this film reminded me of an impressionist painting of the pointalist school. Lots of images, good camera work (although overbearing), but the story had more holes than my old gym socks. Perhaps the Director felt he could fill those holes with some interesting camera angles and a few good boinks in the script. At the end the audience was grumbling. They'd been cheated out of a throughput plot. Maybe it was too sophisticated.  The big test will be to see the fall off in box office in weeks two and three. If it drops more than 35% then the word of mouth wasn't good. If not, then the picture has legs. One thing this picture does lack is repeatability. I, for one, have no desire to see it again. Why did Mel make it?  Did Frank Marshall get down on his knees and beg? Remind me to ask Mel the next time I see him.",1,1,2,11 August 2002
The Matrix," An Incredible Film Whose Influence Is Changing the Industry
","Certain films define their times and set a standard for look, drama, and special effects.  These films seem to come along every decade or so. 50's - Forbidden Planet 60's - 2001: A Space Odyssey 70's - Star Wars 80's - Terminator II 90's - The Matrix.  Each of these films became possible by some technological breakthrough. For example, without the motion control camera, Star Wars wouldn't have been made. Without advances in CGI software and rendering speed - no Terminator II. In the case of The Matrix, it owes a lot of its style to electronic non-linear editing, which allows the picture to go from slow motion to fast motion (undercrank for the old timers) with the click of a mouse. In case you haven't noticed television editing tries to copy the Matrix - just look at CSI.  When the Warshawski Brothers made the film it took a computer and 121 cameras to create the whirl-around effect. Now three years later it can be done with one camera and some Vi(Z)rt software.Let's put aside technology and look at the film.  It's plot is a bit convoluted but certainly accessible. The sub-plot which follows the transformation of Neo is there for all to see. The sub-text, which few people ever get from a film is also up-front.  Our reliance on computers has become total. Put enough high speed computers into a grid system and you have a world as imagined in Collosus: The Forbin Project.  The idea of automata taking over really goes back to the imagination of Czech writer, Karol Capek and his play 'R.U.R.' Capek invented the word Robot, from the Czech verb 'robotus' meaning to serve.Matrix put a fresh spin on reality that puts a question mark on the end of Descartes dictum, 'I think therefore I am'.  The concept was superbly realized. If the acting wasn't world class level, the picture made you think.  Not many films do.  Personally, I can't wait to see the sequels. Incidentally, this film's opening is on a par with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. It hooks you in the first five minutes. Something aspiring screenwriters should consider.10/10",10,0,1,2 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," An Undeniable Classic

Then you go to every studio in town and every genius says 'No'. Finally, Alan Ladd Jr. gives you your shot and it nearly kills you.  You wind up in the hospital basically suffering from chronic anxiety and over work. You kill yourself to finish the film on time. There's a budget crisis that nearly keeps the Cantina scene from being shot. Then on opening night you're having dinner with your wife across the street from Grauman's Chinese Theater and the lines are around the block.Forget the corny Flash Gordon dialog and the campy acting. That's what made the film work. Now for those of you who didn't exist in the 70's and think the SPFX look terrible, remember this, John Dykstra had to invent a motion control camera or they couldn't have made the picture.So everybody who turned down the movie is hiding their shame, maybe a few were fired. And George Lucas owns one of the most profitable motion picture franchises in the world.Please don't annoy me with nit picking the film to death. It set the standard for every tent pole summer movie that followed. Knowing Lucas, if he could have used CGI in '77 he would have - it wasn't available.Funny, I've seen every film in the series, but I've never had such a good time as seeing SW4 when it was first released. My cousin bought some action figures for $1.95, kept them in their shrink wrap, and recently sold them on eBay for $12,000.  Is it a classic?

You've got to love James Garner the scrounger and helpmate the Donald Pleasance (The Forger) and interestingly a prisoner of war himself. John Sturges the Producer/Director had just come off 'The Magnificent Seven' so he was as hot as the core of the sun. Basically the film is about the indominable will of the human spirit. It chronicals the greatest escape attempt of the war, what it doesn't tell you is that it diverted the attention of nearly a million German soldiers from the landing on D-Day.

Gangs of New York," A Film to Be Taken Seriously
","Gangs of New York is an extraordinary piece of filmaking. It embodies more scope than any of Scorcese's other pictures, but in doing so, sacrifices some intimate detail. Be warned, the film is not for the faint of heart. It is extremely violent, but must be so to capture the time in which it takes place. Daniel Day Lewis certainly deserves a nomination, as does it's director. Costume, Set (What a set!!), Cinematography are all nomination level. Although I'm pretty well educated it covers a period about which I knew very little. Do buy a ticket and see what epic filmaking is all about. Don't try to compare it to 'Gone With the Wind' or 'Ben Hur' since those are films were made in another era and are not comparable. Scorcese is worthy of the term 'artist'; it's unfortunate that LOFR is causing the picture to tank at the Box Office. Maybe word of mouth will save it; it will certainly find a new financial life in DVD/VHS. Unfortunately, those who wait for the home video release, will never realize the power of the cinematic screen. 5/5",10,0,0,30 December 2002
