The Devil's Advocate," Not even close.
","This is just...a mishmosh. Too much gratuitous sex and blood hiding the real horror of the theme, a poor performance from Keanu 'But Don't You Think I Sound Like I'm From Georgia' Reaves, and Al Pacino hamming it up and basically playing himself. Avoid this one. It could have been a great movie. What it was was disjointed, overdone, and mediocre at best.",3,7,18,13 December 1999
