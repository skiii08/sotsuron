The New World," did anyone else leave the theather?
","i'm not the kind of guy who enjoys the cinematography or the music in a movie. actually i do enjoy music and cinematography. but not when that is the only thing going on in a movie! i don't see how people enjoy this kind of movie! it has barely any dialog! sure it is very honest. but it does not seem to keep me awake or entertained. it is boring as waiting for a doctor's appointment in a small empty room. there is one two minute battle scene that made me want to watch. but after that, it was back to Indians looking at birds and trees and Collin Farrel teaching an Indian how to talk. doesn't that sound pulse-pumping? (sarcasm.) after watching the first 45 mins. my dad and i decided to leave and go see the 'ringer'. that was much more enjoyable. i came back about 15 minutes before the end of the movie and was not surprised to see an Indian staring at trees in england. all in all, if you are wanting to see an entertaining movie, DO NOT see this film. but if you are wanting a wonderful $10 nap, see this.",1,0,6,23 November 2006
