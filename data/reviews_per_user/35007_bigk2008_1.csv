The Benchwarmers," Histarically Funny!!!
","This movie was by far the best movie I have seen as far, as comedy is concerned, in a long, long time. It was worth every penny I paid. In fact my friend and I almost paid to go right back in once it was finished. I can't wait till it comes out on video. I am going to buy it right away!!! If you liked any of the following movies, then you will love this one!!!: The Water Boy, Dodgeball, Anchorman, Napolean Dynamite The Longest Yard (new one). As far as the Actors go. Jon Heder is proving he is one comediac actor who won't be disapearing soon. I'd say this is the best performance I have seen him in yet. David Spade has shown us how funny he can truly be without the presence of Chris Farely... finally!!! Rob Schneider gave the best performance I have ever seen him give, proving that he is a honestly good actor. In closing GO OUT AND SEE THIS FILM!!!",10,1,9,8 April 2006
