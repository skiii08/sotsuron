First Man," Distant but impressive
",I enjoyed the realism of everything beyond the characters. The daring of the US space program comes through.,8,0,3,19 January 2019
Interstellar," Ridiculously far-fetched - even for sci-fi fantasy
","What a waste. I'm a sci-fi fan and even I give this movie only a '6.'A lot of talented actors, quality sound & cinematography, but the screenplay really doesn't hold up.In addition to being too far-flung in the number of principal characters, it's too long, and becomes almost comical at times in its plot twists.The movie would have been better served to have: - limit principal characters/stories and provide greater depth for remaining ones - Make the earth-related issues more believableYour time is better spent on a lot of other, higher-quality, sci-fi movies.",6,1,1,23 January 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Best movie of 2018
",Rami Malek was phenomenal. Best Lead Male Actor for sure. Thoroughly enjoyable movie. Band interaction was fun and interesting.,8,4,5,29 January 2019
The Favourite," Same style, but gratuitous lewdness
","Loved The Lobster and To Kill a Sacred Deer, but found myself questioning the gratuitous lewdness. Everyone has their limit in their entertainment; I guess I just reached mine. That said, I believe it was executed fairly well for what it was. Makeup, costume and sound were highlights.",5,1,6,19 January 2019
Pretty Woman," Hookerealla fantasy
","There's science fiction that's more plausible than this movie. Let's start with the John's fiction. Apparently this is his first prostitute. He's not abusive, demeaning, and has no fetishes or perversions. Next we have a prostitute with no serious family or abuse issues, substance abuse or STD's. I guess because she's a executive hooker, she has to be white US citizen too.",4,3,5,25 June 2017
The Shape of Water," Let's be serious
","It's a Beauty and the Beast MerMAN movie that was drowned with explicit sexual content and contained promising, though disjointedly-conveyed, race/power/isolation messages. The movie could have cut 15 properly-selected minutes without sacrificing effect.",6,9,15,19 January 2018
Green Book," Best Picture in my book
",Beautiful storytelling. Edited properly. Acted wonderfully. Thoroughly entertaining. No agendas.,10,2,3,21 February 2019
