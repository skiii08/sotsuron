Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This is Comedy Masterpiece On So Many Levels...
","Look at yourself North America. I think the negative reviews are people that don't understand the depth and serious insight it this type of guerrilla comedy style. It amazes me that commitment that Sasha puts into Borat (and all is other characters). Could this be Oscar worthy?? What is the definition of what makes a person Oscar worthy?? I was waiting in line for the 10:35pm show, and I heard a guy on the cell telling his buddy that he was watching the show for a second time. To be honest I'm going tomorrow again with my other buddies. I have NEVER EVER been in an audience that laughed solo much. It was hysterical...And let me tell you this movie has the FUNNIEST scene I have EVER, EVER seen in a movie. And I love comedies.Sasha reminds me so much of my favorite comedian Peter Sellers. That wonderful commitment and believability. Absolutely amazing!!!!! This is a COMEDIC GEM...and a must see.CLASSIC COMEDY and in the top 5 of all time!!!!",10,2,16,5 November 2006
Iron Man 2," Loved This Movie
","I don't normally write reviews, but I had to after seeing some of the Critic reviews. I am a huge, huge comic book fan. Have been since I was 7. Iron Man caught me off guard. I was always loved the 'Avengers' (Marvel comics always beat DC in my world), but Iron Man was never one of my favourite characters, but the first movie was right up there with Batman Begins, Spiderman 2, and X-Men 2. For me Iron Man 2 is in that league. This movie was funny, tons of action, great characters, wonderful ideas with subtle touches. I'm not going into the plot or give spoilers.All I want to say is this movie was darn fun and a great summer movie.Please trust me on this one.",10,8,14,9 May 2010
School of Rock," Funniest Movie In Years...This movie really did ROCK!!!!!!!!
","I absolutely loved this movie. Anyone who doesn't think this movie was well made should get therapy for depression. You'd have to be completely emotionless to not laugh and enjoy the 108 minutes of hilarity. Black is perfect in this role and balances the characters craziness with a good heart, and an understanding toward the children. The children were really good, and by the end you care for them - nice considering the large ensemble. Joan Cusack was excellent as the Principal also.
Here's why I would recommend this movie: Funny as hell, GREAT for the whole family, doesn't rely on gross-out jokes, Jack Black's performance, Best comedy in years, up there with Linklater's Dazed and Confused, this WILL be a classic!!!!!!!!!!!!Rock music has never been funnier (take that back...except for Spinal Tap)!!!!Check it out...now!!!!",10,0,0,4 October 2003
Fantastic Four," This is NOT nearly as bad as critics are making it out to be!!!!!
","I just got back 10 minutes ago and had to write some sort of comment. This movie for 2 hours just flew by. My buddy and I were looked at each other and agreed that it was actually an alright movie. I really enjoyed it the more I think about it. It's NO Batman or Spiderman BUT it's also NO Daredevil and Hulk....I'd say it's in the middle. Since there is no halves (i think it's about a 7.5) I gave it a 7. For me Batman was a 9 and Spiderman also...I haven't seen the perfect 10 yet....It was a great Origin flick...I think it was a nice start to the series...a better director could really take this to the next level...I won't get into the flick, but for all the c**p out there right now...i really enjoyed this as it is: A nice SUMMER, family, comedy, action flick...Good for all ages...FLAME ON!!!!!",7,4,9,9 July 2005
