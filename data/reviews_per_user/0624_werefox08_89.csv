The Mask," A movie that is.....NOT....funny....But is Boring.........
","I have never watched 'The Mask'. Made in 1994, this was quite a big thing...in its day...so I keep being told by my...not so bright friends. After watching it ,,,for the first time...I have to say , it is garbage. The whole thing is ridiculous...and never funny. The pedestrian ...'special effects'...are not really special. Jim Carrey made a mistake when he got involved with this rubbish. Later in his career he did better work...like Liar Liar..and other funny and also serious movies. The people who enjoy this type of movie...are the kind of hombres...I never want to meet. If one can laugh at this drivel ...one may be dangerous. (in a psychiatric way.) Some things work.......The Mask does not work............",3,1,8,8 March 2014
Black Swan," Black Non-sense
","This is The Marx Brothers meets The Shining. It is a movie with a very poor script, and a story that should be a warning to any others thinking about a film about such nonsense. Natalie Portmans acting was abysmal. (she won the Academy Award for best actress !). None of the actors performed well. Its another example of the poor writing that has been in so many recent movies. (when i say recent...i mean for the past 10...15 years.) The added sexual side dishes, scattered here and there at least gave me a laugh. This does for ballet, what Wall Sreet does for honesty. The fact that the Portman character loses her mind and dies only adds to the general absurdity. She may go down in history as one of the worst actors to win an Oscar.",2,4,7,20 April 2013
Scarface," Face it....the Scar runs deep
","An unpretentious, movie about a Cuban immigrant who only wants the world...(a bit greedy). This is a great performance by Al Pacino, who plays Tony Montana a character who has a totally nihilistic personality...and a sick crush on his beautiful sister. He knows the angles ..and is not stupid...but he has not got an ounce of class. Brian De Palma directs this in an unusual way..sometimes hitting the bullseye...then he has a scene that lacks class. The music in Scarface is extremely cheesy. But it fits. Oliver Stones script is also uneven...often intuitive or funny...then a few minutes of low class writing. It is strange how the main characters lack of class works perfectly with the dips in direction and writing. The end of Scarface is Way Over The Top---but it works . Tony has a huge pile of coke on his desk--he takes one inch high lines !! His face becomes like a snowman. The shoot out is 'cartoonish'....but that too works. Scarface has become a cult movie. I love its whole 'in your face' 'take it or leave it' style. An exceptional motion picture.",9,0,2,7 March 2012
The Sound of Music," This is High Class
","There are people saying this is not 'realistic..!!!'. (and their right) Well....Harry Potter, The Lord of The Rings, Spiderman...Etc. Etc. Etc. are also in that category. Also---people never spontaneously burst into song---do they .?? I don't think director Robert Wise was going for realism when he made this. He was trying to entertain audiences.....thats all. Movies today....C.G.I. and Romantic Comedies in particular....are not in the least entertaining. This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when 'musicals' were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place. The 70s were a true golden age for high class films.",9,2,8,14 July 2012
The Hangover," a really bad hangover......Is much better than this
","I read the reviews about The Hangover.....and I thought, at last a comedy motion picture...made in the U.S.A., THAT IS ACTUALLY FUNNY !!!! Great. I watched it last night. Its humour is very American. Which means it is not really funny for people with I.Q.s over 99. Bringing a brain dead X World Champion boxer---who owns a Tiger-- into a woeful film that relies heavily on crass humour....was the ace they had to play. Would it work,,,?? No, it only brings this down to another level. There followed The Hangover 2......Then, surprise surprise....Hangover 3. (Both much worse than the first pile of rubbish) I am a huge fan of American comedy flicks. Like Duck Soup...for example..This utter non--sense would have Groucho...turning in his grave. (These days....rubbish like The Hangover....makes A LOT ..of money !!!!!!!) So Sad.",3,0,2,27 October 2013
Chinatown," Romans Noir Is High Class
","This is yet another example of 1970s movie making in America. Another great movie from the greatest movie making decade..in U.S.A. history. Roman Polanski directs brilliantly, and Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston are simply superb in there roles. This was the era when special effects was lighting a cigarette. So tragic that now we have sunk to middle--earth, and we actually watch C.G.I. garbage. (I don't ). This is one of those films where everything fits. The music by Jerry Goldsmith is lush and with great depth. What is it that separates 'great directors' from the others? I think it is a single minded-ness. They can see the finished product in there minds...and simply work towards it. That was the view of Hitchcock, and i am sure he is talking for most great directors. Anyway, here is a high class film noir to enjoy.",9,1,2,21 January 2013
As Good as It Gets," Too Long...and Not Too Good
","Without the great Jack Nicholson, this would have been a disaster. As usual he is in brilliant form. One of the many problems with AGAIG is the fact that Helen Hunt only ever plays Helen Hunt. A more serious defect is---there is no perceptible chemistry between Nicholson and Hunt. I never believed in there 'love?' Or there relationship. Also--when a gay man gets beaten to a pulp----and a child is continually being rushed to hospital, I have to ask--is that supposed to be funny? The movies running time of 138 minutes is excessive. Its more of a saga than a comedy ..more of a tragedy than a romance. There is an annoying predictability about the whole--thing, too many scenes that make the viewer..uncomfortable. Also scenes that make the viewer --feel embarrassed--for the writer. That---is never a good --indicator.",4,12,31,3 March 2012
Citizen Kane," A King Kong..right hook..of a movie---Simply The Best---
",Of course...everything has been said about ..Citizen Kane. I have watched it--at least--35 times. I intend to watch it..another 35 times ..at the rate of 35 times every few years---I will have to stop------in the foreseeable future. (maybe !!) The words that spring to my mind when i think about CK are ---Classic---Ridiculously Scandalous---Incredibly Sculpted---Welles/Genius--- and ETC. ETC. ETC. It is rightly recognized as the BEST...light years ahead of its time. It is 71 years old. It represents a hand book for other directors to ----make a masterpiece. (they cant) It would be like Piccasso showing a cartoonist to paint. Genius cant be taught------you are one----or your not. The movie is a Knockout.,10,0,1,3 March 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Basterds Pack A Punch
","Since Resovior Dogs, Quentin Tarantino has carved out an impressive career for himself. Apart from Kill Bill one and two (both stupid and very bad), all of his material has been in the ..around 7...score. (Out of 10) No classics, just good --fairly simple--movies. With Inglorious Basterds, once again he makes a simple film...that anyone can understand. After he made Resovior Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino told the world (many, many times) 'I am a story teller'. We know that. Where he fails (in relation to Capolla and perhaps Scorsese and the Coens) is his in-ability to change his style. There is always blood accompanied by incandescent music. We know he does death....very well...anything else ??",7,0,1,30 March 2013
12 Monkeys," If You Think James Bond Is Escapism.....TRY THIS...!!!!
","Made in 1995, and Directed by the zany Terry Gilliam ...this a a superior sci. fi. flick. If you want escapism, and you want to rest your rational mind ...watch this 129 minute trip. The three main actors---Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe are great. The sets are astounding (without relying too much on C.G.I.) The movie purrs along at a good gallop ---so try not to miss a minute as the story goes back and forth in time...and the sub plots are deep. This was my first viewing and I will need to watch it again...(those pesky telephone calls !!!) I will be happy to have another look at this extremely well made film. I am sure it is one of those movies that one never forgets...because of its total originality ...Loved It....(You probably think it is 2013....are you sure ?)",9,1,2,25 September 2013
Argo," Average Movie..........Vastly Over-rated
","In the 'Golden Age' of great cinema (the 70s) this would not have got a nomination for a best picture Oscar. To-day ?? it actually won B.P. It is the way things are now...progress ..? not at all, just change and in what the studios can get away with. Having said that, 2013 will go down as a weak year for films. Ben Affleck directs well in the easy parts. But Robert Altman would be turning in his grave at the dialogue scenes (particularly those with more than two characters). It is an art that only the great (or very good directors) get right. O.K., its BASED on a true story (big deal). It is like an old 2nd world war movie...the Germans were shown to be stupid. This time its the Iranians. People are calling it clever...and only the Americans could have pulled it off. That is total rubbish. Enjoy this for what it is...a run of the mill adventure flick...and that is all. (Special mention for Alan Arkin, who had ALL the funny one liners...and he delivered them brilliantly). 5% of this movie MAY have been true.",5,12,20,10 April 2013
Elizabeth," Queen Cate......is .....Perfect
",Firstly a quick message to the...goof-balls...who whine 'but its not completely historically accurate' Hey ..goof-balls..this is a piece of entertainment. It takes a contemporary look at the life of Queen Elizabeth. The movie is great. Cate Blanchett is truly memorable as Elizabeth. Geoffrey Rush is superb as the crafty Walsingham. Shekhar Kapur directs with subtlety and assurance. Blanchett has never been better --graduating from a love sick youth..to a Queen..who realizes that men are ..dispensible. She remains extremely sexy throughout--this film..and she matures quickly as she realizes---this Queen thing ..is her gig. The modern feel about this work....is not a hindrance. The pace is so perfect we go along--and love every bump in the road. Easily the best movie about Queen Elizabeth. A great movie.,9,1,2,9 March 2012
Ted," Something About Teddy
","A comedy is supposed to be funny...this is funny. A teddy bear who delivers X rated one liners does not seem like much fun, but in 'Ted' ...it works. Something About Mary has a cult following(a few rude men) ...because of its gross out scenes. So why not a little bear who smokes, drinks and has a girl friend..?? The 'hard core' jokes come thick and fast...and they don't ease down...during the whole movie. I am not as enthusiastic about this as most other reviewers. There is a touch of desperation when you need a teddy bear to deliver obscenities (and to divert the audience). The only real certainty is there will be a Ted 2 , and it wont be as funny as the first one (they never are). This humour is an acquired taste, particularly when it is flung at you for 1 hour 45 minutes. Its like eating chocolate / fudge ice cream for 1 hour and 45 minutes (you become sick). This is a movie for people who enjoy crass humour. What next ?? Barbie Dolls Hangover at The Richard Pryor Show. ?",5,4,11,6 July 2012
Troy," Troy....an Underrated Movie
","Troy was one of those films that Professional reviewers scoffed at. Quotes like 'Brad Pitts accent sounds ridiculous Etc' I don't like many CGI movies, but this is one of the better ones. Pitt is just fine as Achilles & the acting is generally convincing. The script (like all modern scripts) is not fantastic.....but better than most. I don't think it would be inappropriate to take the children along to see this little piece of history. A brave decision to make this...And it works pretty well. Historical movies are difficult to make..now. This 2004 film may be highly appreciated in years to come--When CGI takes over completely --and--actors are replaced by better versions of themselves. 'Its the way of the future'",8,0,0,25 February 2015
Just Go with It," One Laugh.......Would Have Been Nice.....But There Were None
","It was only recently that i found out...Rom--Coms were actually called 'date movies'. This is...i suppose...a date movie. This is a movie which has NO LAUGHS. Maybe that is what they went for...a date movie with no laughs. Perhaps the thinking here was...no other date movie has any laughs, why should we be different. Adam Sandler has done so many of these, that he has stopped acting in them. He just goes around with a pronounced silly look in his face. Jenifer Aniston never WAS funny, so she just becomes a more tired looking version of herself. To watch this, and to listen to the dreadful script could take a couple of points off your I.Q. I never even dreamed that movies could be so awful. Call them Rom-Coms---call them date movies, but mostly ---call them utter rubbish.",1,5,10,22 February 2013
Brokeback Mountain," A Failed Attempt To Be............Different
","Any movie that breaks new ground, is normally mis-judged. This is mis-judged. The acting between the two lovers is not convincing...(the acting across the board is sub-standard.) This is a long saga about two men who fall in love. It becomes tedious and boring after an hour. I never gave the story much credibility...these guys got away with murder at a time when that was not possible. Juggling marriages with 'love' for another man, is quite a trick. The direction is sluggish and self indulgent. Many 'experts' thought this should have won an Academy Award for best picture. Crash won it (rightly so) and it would have been for all the wrong reasons...if Brokeback Mountain had won. The decision to have Heath Ledger mumble all his lines was wrong. The audience need to here what is actually being said.....Also sentimentality is eventually brushed on thickly.....much thicker than needed. An average movie.",4,1,15,30 August 2012
The Hustler," This Game of Pool.............Makes a Great Movie
","This is a brilliant movie. The four main actors are sensational. Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, George C. Scott and Piper Laurie were all perfect choices for their roles. Different people see this film in vastly different ways. Most people say its about a young man finding 'character'. Thats true, but it is also about a simple game...pool. A game...like all games that creates its own masters. It is also about two giants of the game who clash ...like gladiators...with pride and passion. Each one thinking he is number one --- each giving deep respect to his opponent. The movie contains a real soul-less gambler (Scott) who is only interested in peeling off the psychological layers of naive young men with potential. Then when they are 'naked'--put huge bets on them. Winning for this guy is as exciting as yawning. The money means nothing. If someone is eliminated along the way---thats too bad. Everyone in Scotts universe is disposable. The movie is a microcosm of life...played out on a green baize table Director Robert Rossen has made an unforgettable movie.",10,0,1,17 September 2012
Juno," Juno ...Something ? This Is Not Good
","The lead actress here (Ellen Page) is 16 years old, but she is the most annoying 16 year old the big screen has ever shown. She is sickeningly confident, horribly brash and impudent and walks around like she is the Buddah (she knows all.) The movie is well written (and has funny moments) but why the constant use of bad music? The film is like an empty egg. All the goodness has been taken away..and we are left with a thin and NOT believable load of junk. I can only assume this is a girlie picture aimed at girls. It is hard to believe this was nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards. It was up against No Country for Old men (the winner), Atonement, Michael Clayton and There Will Be Blood. Four excellent movies and this rubbish. Thankfully it did not win, but one never knows at the Oscars (remember Citizen Kane)",3,4,9,13 February 2013
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," simply G--R--E--A--T !
","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was made in 1969. It is in my top 10 films of all time. Few movies change our culture----this one did. Who are those guys ? Girls wanted to have fun too---so they pinched the word 'guys' and now it ain't --GUYS AND DOLLS---its guys and guys !! Oh why not ? (before BC & SD , guys were always males). The writer William Goldman delivered a knock-out script---up there with Double Indemnity and Network. The 'pure entertainment' which lies at the heart of this masterpiece is also at the core of why BC&SK is historically an extremely important motion picture. I have been hearing a remake of BC&SK is being considered !! That is a nutty decision (if its true). We should all see this movie--we all need a little dose of perfection---from time to time. All of the above ......may be ...totally accurate !",10,2,4,3 March 2012
The Beach," Dumb Movie.....Badly Made
","There are many problems with the Beach. The story is ridiculous---and the actors give limp performances---indicating that they too did not believe in the project. The script is really bad...as banal as its possible to be. Danny Boyles direction is clunky...and he does not get good performances from his actors. Was this aimed at a teenage audience? Perhaps we will never know. Leonardo Di Capprio is totally un-convincing in the leading role. When that happens, the movie is almost certain to fail...and this one does. There is a market for movies that are SO bad..they must be watched. This doesn't quite fit into that category...but its near..!!!",2,2,4,6 November 2012
The Town," A Town With Many Holes
","The story...here...has more holes in it than a golf course. That is sad, because the movie is quite watchable. Ben Affleck directs it well, and his acting is reasonable. He is backed up by an interesting cast, but it is all superfluous ...when the script and story are sub par. It is a bit like 'Heats' (a similar and much better movie made in 1995 starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino) little brother. The pace---the guns the taking down of scores. Affleck should look for a tale which is totally different...this type of movie has been done (better) many times before. What about a remake of the Wizard of Oz ??. Or Tarzan and the Chocolate Factory ??.",4,1,1,8 September 2013
Taxi Driver," The Great....De Niro
","The presence of Robert De Niro--in the title role--is the most important reason why this work is an outstanding motion picture. He completely becomes--Travis Bickle--a socio/psycho-path. An incredible achievement....and De Niros finest hour. He refused to break character during filming---and made some of his co-players --a little nervous on set. Martin Scorsese uses some wonderfully inventive direction---but his usual sloppiness --in relation to continuity--is there for all to see. Writer Paul Schraver wrote a great script---very New York --but universal in its examination of loneliness. However--it is the gradual disintegration of Bickle--into madness, that is the rock solid viewing foundation of this Classic movie experience.",9,2,3,3 March 2012
Lost in Translation," Self Indulgent and Shallow
",Existentialist philosophers like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche would have dis-liked this movie. They both were completely against any kinds of pretentiousness. Me too....i also disliked this because it was made by Sofia Coppola...for Sofia Coppola. (self indulgence) I hope she liked it !! Pretentious movies are fairly common. Lots of directors who make them ..hope they will be seen as art house. Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this...her father Francis Ford Copolla (who likes to keep it in the family) co-produced it. The film is really well photographed. And that is all. Existentialists try to make complex things simple. Pretentious movie makers try hard to make simple things complex.....And that is all.....,2,7,14,20 September 2012
Forrest Gump," Forrests ....I.Q....Is High Enough
","When Forrest Gump was released in 1994 it was more of an event than a movie release. This is a brilliant movie...it is full of wisdom and simple truths. Recently, some of the top physicists in the world have seriously questioned if intelligence is a good thing. The only things on earth that like intelligence are home sapiens...and they invented it. The dinosaurs were not intelligent, yet ruled the world for 150 million years. Modern man has ruled the world for only a little over 200,000 years, and with all his 'intellegence' has made a very bad job of looking after the planet. Homo sapiens probably have very little time left here on earth. When we meet Forrest Gump (brilliantly played by Tom Hanks) he is a young boy. He has an I.Q. of 75. When he is a man he functions like a man with an I.Q. of about 85---88. His simplicity gives him implicit honesty and a foundation of pure goodness. Things always appear to go right for Gump and after a stint in the Vietnam war, he becomes a very rich man. Religion, mysticism and and the political process are three of many things that Forrest cant understand. But he is a banner holder for that dying human behaviour.....common decency. There are other fundamentally simple messages in this great movie. As a piece of entertainment it is magnificent. As a lesson to us all on how we should live...it is spiritual. Much deeper than most people realize...this is a contemporary classic.",10,3,5,6 July 2012
The Godfather: Part II," A Great Crime Movie
","It became fashionable, trendy and hip...around 1978 to say The Godfather Part Two is better than The Godfather. Even today attention seeking personality disordered people still say it. Its not as good as the Godfather....but it is still a great movie. Its very well directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and Al Pacino gives a solid performance as the godfather. We are into the 1950s and organized crime is not quite as brutal as it was. Pacino has a lot on his plate...making deals with the unpredictable Hyman Roth (brilliantly played by Lee Strasberg) and finding the traitor in his family is Fredo. This huge mistake by Fredo will (must) cost him his life. (never go against the family) There are flashback sequences about Pacinos father (played by Robert Di Niro) ...his arrival in New York as a simple boy....and his rise to crime boss as he realizes shooting 'big shots' makes people respect you. In the end Coppola ties things together with a few killings...as he did in the Godfather. This is never a boring film...there are many things 'going on'. Highly entertaining, intelligent The Godfather Part Two is extremely satisfying.",9,0,2,1 July 2012
The Aviator," De Caprio.....Fails....Movie....Fails
","This should have been better.....I see this still scores 7.5 on IMDb.....Which is a little amazing. It is only an average flick with Scorsese not at his best ( He was only a very few times 'at his best') Cate Blanchet over-acts so blatantly She had to win the Oscar.... De Caprio trys his best but he is a trillion miles from.....The guy he is supposed to be This is really not a 7.5 movie....It is a movie where the main character is played by a Non--Entity Who never GOT the character......And so the movie is so not 7.5 Lots of people see Scorsese movies Because they think they may see a Taxi Driver...or a Good Fellas ,,,,,",7,0,2,1 January 2015
The Bourne Identity," Boring Bourne........Simply Boring
","A movie that gorillas, orang utangs, and chimpanzees would appreciate. Also gamers..(those poor lonely people who play video games...a lot). The story cant be more simple. The script could not be more simple. The acting (was this really acting??) is awful. It is a fast moving film, and it has a car chase too. Matt Damon must have been told....keep the same facial expression all through the movie. And that is exactly what he does. There are sequels Bourne 2 and Bourne 3...which are (incredibly) a little worse than this. Joan Allen is in both those sequels....she must have been told....look angry all through the movie. And that is exactly what she does. The trilogy is rubbish. Movies made....strictly....for Dummies. The stories are supposed to be about exciting things happening in the world of spying (C.I.A. etc.)",2,0,2,29 September 2012
The Shining," A Spectacular Movie
","Stanley Kubrick is probably the best film maker ever in the English speaking world. In The Shining he once again shows his wonderful imagination, attention to detail, and obsessive nature that made him the master he was. This is a complex movie about horror, ghosts, deep psychological issues and the effects living in an empty very large Hotel in the middle of nowhere...may have on a fragile individual. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall ...with their 9 year old son Danny Lloyd move in as winter caretakers to the very remote Overlook Hotel. Jack plays a recovering alcoholic and he intends to use up a lot of the spare time he will have...writing a novel. The Hotel is built on an old Indian burial ground...and a few years earlier a caretaker had chopped up his wife and children...because they were...mis-behaving. Cracks soon begin to appear in Jacks personalty, and the appearance of ghosts don't help him. What he needs is a good stiff drink. The sets in this are in a grand scale..as you would expect from Kubrick..and the use of the Steadycam (new at that time) is a huge plus. Its a great movie, but you should not expect to get all the answers. There are loose ends. But thats perfectly O.K. in a movie like this.",9,1,3,13 September 2012
American Beauty," beauty is all around us ..!
","'Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, i feel like i cant take it---and my heart is just going to cave in' says Ricky Fitz (Wes Bently) after he has shown his next door neighbor/ girlfriend his tapes of a plastic bag---blowing in the wind. We need to understand that phrase if we want to get any-where near --understanding American Beauty. We also have to know Ricky has been in a mental hospital, and he is a marijuhana dealer. I have read a few reviews about this movie--and I know we all have our own views. I don't think it is about relationships, or individuals. The 'look closer' message is the key. Its a bit like Mulholland Drive --not really complex. If we all looked closer perhaps we would all see the beauty in things like dancing plastic bags. Or (as Ricky does near the end of the movie).....he sees beauty in blood pouring out of Lester Burhams head (Kevin Spacey). We can talk about the neurotic Carolyn , the mis-shaped daughter , the lost in space friend , the violent father---and on and on and on. This is fundamentally a beautiful movie. We are asked to 'find all that beauty in the world' We are asked to --LOOK CLOSER. This was Sam Mendes first movie. It is a visual feast---a great piece of highly original material, and a truly entertaining motion picture. After Stephen Spielberg saw it for the first time...he cried...he told Sam Mendes he had made a great movie. Analyzing it is not important------enjoy it.",9,0,1,6 March 2012
Duck Soup," Groucho the Master Chef ..Try His Duck Soup !
","This is mayhem, and, chaos, and nutty, and havoc, and very funny. It proves once and for all that Duck Soup, if it is made by a great chef.......tastes wonderful. Made in 1933, this Marx Brothers classic is the funniest movie in motion picture history. Groucho delivers his one liners with machine gun precision.....and always hits the target. There will simply NEVER be any 'funny guy' who will even come close to The Grouch. Its a fact.....during the past 79 years no comedy has bettered this. The last 25 years have been really bad....badly written, terribly acted....and NOT funny. Its all so pretentious, today. Will Ferrell ?? are we kidding ?? The guy is awful. And 'the others' are only marginally better. Writers should remember a simple rule..........people who go to the cinema to see a comedy........expect to laugh.",10,7,9,4 April 2012
Gandhi," Gandhi.............Far Above A Saint
","Gandhi is a great movie, and truly deserved its 8 Oscars. Director Sir Richard Attenbourgh finding an actor like Ben Kingsley, must have felt like he had discovered Plutonium. Kingsley turned out to be more like Gandhi than the Mahatma himself. If you don't learn something from this movie, check into a clinic for Nazis. There are many scenes that touch you. My favourite is when a big important judge played by Trevor Howard is visibly shaken when he looks at Gandhi in the dock. Howard is diminished in stature just by looking at humanity ...in the flesh. It is undoubtedly a true epic (Titanic was not...not even close) and a movie about a man who really was real...and his story very real. The old religions lean on old books that are almost certainly ...no-where near what REALLY happened. To-day the Catholic church scratches around for people who 'other people' say did great things, so they can proclaim them saints. Utter rubbish. The first thing The Catholics need to do is stop sexually abusing children.",9,2,3,16 April 2013
American History X," Weak Movie............About A Strong Subject
","This is a movie....full of meaning ....that, in the final analysis is meaningless. It often tastes like sugar candy, and yet again, like Scotch Whisky. There are periods of sick....racism....but that never appears to be real. The key scenes when the Edward Norton character faces up to the Stacey Keach big boss Nazi horror....are under-developed. If your going to make a movie about black / white neo racism you need to come up with something better than this. This was made in 1998 and it feels like 1962. This is a film that means well...to expose the nastiness of colored hatred, yet it never comes near explaining the reasons, why blacks and whites....just do not get along. Too many weak scenes that are...not believable.",4,6,14,30 March 2013
Tropic Thunder," Stiller And Black......Fail To .....Deliver
","I read a lot of the IMDb reviewers opinions. What came up again and again was 'I have a problem with Ben Stiller'. This movie is genuinely funny at times. Given the wonderful premise, it should have been VERY funny...throughout. Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr. are actors. REAL ACTORS. Stiller, Jack Black are funny guys ??? ..who really don't act very well. Stiller has not learned to stop TRYING to act. Just be yourself Ben....you couldn't act your way out of a paper bag. Jack Black did not do a very good job either. He never appeared comfortable at any stage of the movie. Movie acting is easy (ask Al Pacino). The trick is ..don't try too hard. Downey Jr. and Cruise are 'just fine and dandy', and looked like they had a ball making this. I have been hearing that Ben Stiller may stick to directing if his new movie 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is well received. He certainly is not a funny guy....so I hope Mitty does well. Even with the lame duck performances by Stiller and Black....this is still a movie worth seeing. You will L.O.L., but you wont be convulsing on the floor in fits of laughter (like you should have been)------",7,0,0,19 December 2013
The Commitments," A poor movie.................................
","The Commitments directed by Alan Parker...is one of those movies that..you want to like. When i watched it (recently) I knew after 15 minutes i could never ---enjoy this. This is a movie that tries hard to be...funny...indeed it is funny, but in such a contrived way there is no audience laughter. One can see the next 'one liner'...from 12 paces. It is a film that is ..trying too hard to be authentic. And the audience can see all the 'blood, sweat and tears'....that went into making this. To put it simply...this just does not work...like lots of movies it barely entertains. I will have forgotten this in about one week. Alan Parker movies tend to be predictable.

No Country for Old Men," When Chigurh is around......There Will Be Blood
","This movie is well made....well acted....well scripted. Has an interesting story, and just about everything going for it. It presents us to Anton Chigurh, (Javier Bardem) a man who appears to have no conscience....He is like a simple killing machine. You want someone rubbed out..?? then this is your man. But don't upset him, and don't play 'toss the coin' with him. He kills like he is robotic. Without feeling. He is Hannibal Lecter ..without the brain. For a movie that is steeped in blood, it has many funny lines. Tommy Lee Jones (the sheriff) is the only one who seems to sense...law and order are fading fast. Its the year 1980 and drugs have become a massive industry, but too many amateurs mean lots of stuff ups. Josh Brolin stumbles apon a 'deal gone wrong', and helps himself to a satchel containing 2 million dollars. He is a Vietnam Vet., but thats not going to make much difference when Chigurh is hired to get the money. The pace here is good...always interesting always entertaining. For all its good points,No Country for Old Men always leaves me cold. Perhaps its the depressing reality that Chirgurh is free to go on killing who he feels like. And Sherrifs like the Tommy Lee Jones character feel 'overmatched' (which they most definitely are). In the end, all is bleak and dark. Dealing in drugs and lawlessness appears to have won. Michael Clayton and There will be Blood could have won the best picture Oscar in 2007. They didn't...this movie did...and thats fair enough.",8,2,2,29 August 2012
Man on the Moon," Kaufmans Bland Exit
","Andy Kaufman may have been a funny guy, but this movie is a bomb. Jim Carrey is not good as Kaufman, but Andy would have said..'Ï don't care'. The movie has so many flaws i really don't know where to start. Mr. Kaufman was an 'avante guard' comedian, which is like saying...it is kind of art house and you 'get' it or you don't. His flaky style of substituting himself with another character was funny...if you saw it once. But Andy used this over and over. He was in the sit-com Taxi, and if there was one thing Kaufman did have it was confidence in his own material. (he didn't see his weaknesses). The best thing one can say about Kaufman---is that he was highly original. The movie is one long tedious bore, and Carrey does nothing to lift the sinking film. If this was Kaufmans highlights, i am glad they never showed the low parts of his life. It appears he was vastly over-rated.",3,2,5,19 February 2013
Seabiscuit," See Seabiscuit............Learn About Life
","Sports movies are notorious for being...off the mark...when it comes to the action. Here is probably the best ever sports movie. Artistic licence is taken freely, but who cares when the star of the movie - Seabiscuit - is seen as he really was: a broken 3 year old colt with the knackery waiting for him. There are many true lessons to be learned from watching (and listening) to this movie. Give losers a second chance is the most important. The Chris Cooper character is what we would now call 'a horse whisperer'. He has an uncanny ability to get into the psyche of horses. When he sees a horse with lots of heart (like 'The Biscuit') he knows it. Seabiscuit was small, but a warrior who never gave up. (yet another life lesson). The highlight of this excellent movie is when Seabiscuit has a match race with War Admiral...a blue blood and the best horse in America. Because of meticulous tactics worked out by Cooper (now the horses trainer) the small horse beats the giant War Admiral by 4 lengths. If you are a reader of my reviews ...you will know i write one paragraph reviews. I mean who wants a blow by blow account of a movie..??? You may feel you have seen the film...and decide not to watch it. Anyway this is a superior movie (not only for horse racing fans). I am sure anyone with heart will enjoy this.",9,1,3,8 March 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Walter Mitty ..? ..You Cannot Be Serious ..!!
","This is not a remake of the 1947 classic 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'. This should have been called....The Secret Life of e-Harmony (an online dating Agency). Is it possible for an actor to use one and a half expressions throughout a complete 2 hour movie?? ....Yes it is..!!!!!! Oh Ben Stiller--- (Director and player of Walter Mitty) how could you be so wooden ?? This is a movie.....or is it..?? The amount of product placement here is ridiculous. E Harmony is the first in a long line of adds. The movie is over the top with the day dream sequences and (of course) C.G.I. is used in abundance. It is well photographed (if you like scenery this is your film) , but is this a comedy ?? The use of the name Walter Mitty is the only (sick) joke I can think of. The guy who came up with that was thinking ONLY of the novelty (and the money).Mitty is used in many dictionaries...after Danny Kayes wonderful performance in the REAL FUNNY Secret life of Walter Mitty. This is sure to be a success. (Yes, that's how poor it is)",2,29,63,24 December 2013
Schindler's List," Oskars Brave Odyssey
","Although there are a lot of harrowing images in this excellent movie, I have a feeling no film has ever really shown the true graphic horrors of the death camps. I am sure that movie...will be made someday. There so many Jewish people being murdered in this fine motion picture, but,...in the end it is about a brave man being totally psychologically transformed. Months of seeing human beings being brutalized and getting to know them (his factory used the Jews as cheap labor) as individuals, made Nazi Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) change dramatically. This is not the usual Steven Spielberg fare. He directs this with a deft touch. The holocaust should NEVER be forgotten...and man should have learned from it. Unfortunately since this catastrophic human disaster there have been more cases of 'ethnic cleansing'. 'When will we ever learn ?'",9,28,47,3 September 2012
The Hurt Locker," Bigelows Bomb.......Bang ! ! !
","This was SO realistic. But unfortunately, it was one of the worst movies to win Best Picture at the Acadamy Awards. What we have here is a 'nutjob' who has a death wish (or has a serious mental illness.) I didn't care if he lived or died. The actual character is never explored beyond the shallow ..so all we know is that he is a modern day war junkie cretin. Kathryn Bigelow went for complete realism.....and she got it. So what ? We don't go to the cinema to watch idiots pretending to be heroes. The truth is--this is instantly forgettable. If you DID get your kicks watching this-------perhaps a visit to your doctor may be a sensible course of action for you. So---some people yearn to be blown to pieces (big deal). Some people like frogs.",2,5,8,17 April 2012
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Curious Movie.........Strangely Forgettable
","This is like Forrest Gump, Magnolia, The Cider House Rules and Groudhog Day all rolled up into one movie. Its visually extremely well made. I do understand this is a fantasy film, but there are so many serious pseudo philosophical lines here, that Wittgenstein would have been scratching his head. Lines have been crossed here...those of common sense and those of 'bouncy mathematics'. Does it work..?? ..NO it does not. If its a rainy afternoon and you have nothing to do...you can watch this. Enjoy the screenplay...the acting...the wonderful visuals. But don't try to use Einsteins logic...to work out whats happening. Some movie makers go for too much....then the boat they were making....sinks. That is what happened here.",5,1,2,16 October 2012
Donnie Brasco," Depp & Pacino Save This ....Average Movie
",Donnie Brascoe is one of those movies that should have been much better than it turned out to be. The back up players in the Mob were not in the least convincing ..particularly Michael Madsen. Al Pacino and Johnny Depp do enough to make this an..OK..film. Mike Newells direction needed to be more taught...and crisp. If one of the definitions of a great movie is...you can watch it multiple times....then this is far from being a great movie. The story itself is handled sloppily and the use of the word 'forgetaboutit' (in an average script) becomes tedious. It is...of course ...saved by the two leads. But even above average acting by the two 'stars' is simply not enough.,5,14,19,30 June 2012
Mulholland Drive," Hollywood...Stripped....Bare
",Mullholland Drive is NOT complex. If you don't get it first time---watch it again. Its really a rather simple story. The thing i really liked about this work was the odd little 'sketches'. The one with the Cowboy....like a Monty Python sketch !! Also the one about trying to get the perfect coffee (brilliant). The theater where the miming goes on is sensational. Mr. Lynch is mis-understood. There is a great number of people who believe he makes 'intellectual films'. Thats nonsense. He makes different films. But all directors make different films...i here you say. Yes but Mr. Lynchs are more different than the others. This is one of his best...its teasing way of attempting to disorganize your mind is validated when you say-----OH !!! I GET IT... Naughty Mr. Lynch !! He is such a mischievous man. Very good movie.,9,7,12,8 March 2012
The Piano," The Piano Sinks.....And Thats No Bad Thing
","The Piano is 121 minutes, but it feels like a 3 hour movie. My opinion of this over-rated bunkum, is that it IS over-rated bunkum. I read a few reviews and there are many who feel that this is an art movie. Believe me, this is very far from being art-house. Its that old love triangle, which has been done more times than there are stars in the sky. So, what is it that makes some professional reviewers go weak at the knees after they watch this ? Well there is the voice-over from the mute. A mute talking is so breathtaking...i must give this an extra star. (Thinks the reviewer). It is a grim film to sit through. Just mud and Kiwis..and not a laugh in site. I do concede that the acting and the camera work are both very good, but what we have here is a director who was so intensely trying to make this great---she forgot the fundamentals of movie making. Make it for the public..don't make it for yourself.",4,2,6,14 February 2013
Jerry Maguire," Tom is in Cruise Control
","Jerry Maguire is a rare type of movie---a romantic comedy which actually DOES have a few laughs. Tom Cruise gives perhaps his finest ever performance in this above average ROM-COM. The central message---love conquers all---is delivered gently with some deft writing. Maguire, caught up in the cynical world of sports agents decides that 'heart and honesty' is the way to go. Its a brave decision and only Dorothy Boyd (Rene Zellwegger) believes in him and his new philosophy. It threatens to become cheesy as their relationship develops----but this film is better than most and it never dips into 'Yucky' territory. Its difficult to criticize this movie....because it delivers what it promises. And it entertains till the end. Very good movie.",8,1,1,16 April 2012
The Dark Knight," Such Rubbish....
","The tragedy about most movies in the last 20 years is that the scripts and acting mean nothing. It is all about CGI....and that is SO sad. This crap is just another example. If you like 'Super-heroes' you may enjoy this. I dislike Super-heroes (perhaps ..because I have a brain) However--lots of people LOVE this kind of trash..Heath Ledger won an Oscar for his ridiculous performance...He was actually an above average actor, but this whole pile of nonsense was just...very bad. Batman or Superman ? Both are better in the magazines...The young folks who spend half their lives looking at their Smart-Phones (trying to work out how to use them !!) Will love a movie where you don't need to use your brain.",3,3,5,8 May 2015
Into the Wild," Life is Not......Like This
","This movie is based on a true story. I thought it would be full of Philosophical truths and some old hippy 'wisdom'. Its not. The story is actually ..a little ridiculous. Clever college graduate has a less than perfect up--bringing (parents quarreling etc.), and he is SO upset, he goes on the road---to seek truth. His dream is to go to 'freezing Alaska', to see if he can tame that barren wilderness, while searching for the truth. He cant---he freezes to death. This is a --flashback movie--and thats O.K. The use of music here is very annoying. A song is sung (with lyrics that suit the scene the audience is watching) ...just in case the viewers are dumb. Our hero Alex, goes through many adventures and meets amazingly 'nice hippy type people'. The only violence in the movie is when Alex gets kicked around after a railway hard nut chucks him off a freight train. In the end Alex finds the 'Truth'. Happiness only really happens...when it is shared. (How original .!!) This is a heavily sanitized version of 'The Truth', and simply not satisfactory.",4,4,5,2 August 2012
Elysium," Elysium..................Drug For Insomnia..............
","As I right this review this movie has a 7 rating....from the IMDb users. This is one of an increasing number of movies -----where the CGI -----is more important than the actual movie. It is a movie where there is no feeling, no emotion. The story is paper thin...the acting...terrible the script is awful. The STAR is the special effects. The truth----I guess----is we are near a time where actors will not be needed. Any of them can be computerized, and the fact is...most actors will act better...when they are. This is a film that needs a young audience...perhaps...8 through to 17. Any adult who finds this entertaining, needs to find a Psychologist,,, ,with special powers. Hypnosis , wont be enough.................",2,4,8,31 August 2013
Once Upon a Time in America," Opium Or Valium.....Who Cares ?
","I watched the 347 minute version. I didn't find it boring, nor the story complicated. However this is not a 10/10 movie. There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a 'line up' so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the 'was the whole movie an opium dream ?' conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about. Vastly over rated, and NOT in the same class as the Godfather. Sergio Leone died 5 years after making this. He was 60 years old. He will be remembered for his 3 spaghetti westerns (in non speaking Italian countries), and for his contribution to the Italian movie industry.",5,7,17,27 February 2013
The Artist," The 'Hollow' Artist.......Is An Escape Artist
","This is entertaining, but its a highly flawed movie. The story is very thin... everyone knows silent actors struggled badly when the 'talkies' arrived. The two lead actors...Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo...are outstanding. The photography, music, direction are all good. I certainly did not believe that this should have won the Best Picture Academy Award. Its basically a bit of a mess...daring.?? YES brave.?? YES. One either goes hook..line..and sinker for the way Dujardin is left in a 'silent world'. Or, like me you see this as an clever way to show the audience just how hard the transformation effected some of the biggest stars. It IS quite entertaining...no question about that. Its just that its not in any way...near the mark...about what really happened in early Hollywood, and as it skips along at a fast pace one is aware of the hollow nature of the story.",6,0,3,18 October 2012
A Clockwork Orange," A...Kubrick...Fairy...Tale
","Millions of words have been written about A Clockwork Orange. The social, psychological, political, ethical, moral views Etc. Etc. To say this film was a LITTLE controversial when it came out......is like saying George W. Bush is only a LITTLE stupid. Stanley Kubrick and his family got death threats---he had it shelved---and ordered that it never be shown in the U.K. until after his death.(Thats what happened). The story is actually very simple...bad boy commits murder...he is trialled on a new 'cure' for BAD PEOPLE...one of his victims gets revenge...the 'cure' doesn't work. Its psycho / sexual Hans Christian Anderson. Goldilocks with vodka and lime & bitters twist. Snow White and the seven erections. There are (of course) very confronting scenes---the rape seen--where the husband is forced to watch. The middle aged fruit cake who gets smashed in the head with a giant penis. A few other milder bits of violence. Kubricks direction is O.K. (a little pedestrian at times). The script is average. The actors do there thing. Its no where near being a classic. Its only A Clockwork Orange. (It is...however...an above average movie.).",7,0,2,6 March 2012
Groundhog Day," Marvelous Murray is Magical
","Bill Murray is at his very best playing Phil Connors, the egotistical T.V. weatherman. He is sent to Punxsatawney to see if Phil The Groundhog is going to predict a longer or shorter winter. Its a yearly festival and Connors is on his fifth year of covering the event. Then something inexplicable happens....Phil Connors is stuck in Groundhog Day. He is greeted every morning by the voices of Sonny and Cher on radio. (pure hell !!) The day does not repeat for others...so his problem is strictly personal. Its a clever premise, and is used well to provide some interesting humorous events. Connors finally (after some strange adventures) realizes that living 'one perfect day'...is the only way out. He needs to make Rita (Andie McDowell) a sweeter than sweet whiter than white T.V. producer, fall in love with him. Not an easy task......she is a good Catholic girl who loves French poetry. We never find out how long Phil is stuck in this condition...but thats O.K., this is good fun. Ultimately, its a feel good movie. It also presents some interesting existential and philosophical dilemmas. Always entertaining---always highly amusing---Groundhog Day is truly memorable",9,1,3,14 April 2012
Reservoir Dogs," Raw meat...for the audience
","Reservoir Dogs was made on a very low budget. However, Quentin Tarantino makes a superior movie. Its a 'Heist Gone Wrong' story which is always interesting----It is scattered with comedy (and Black Humour) ..and amusing dialog about the most meaningless subjects ----for example (the Music of Madonna !!). We never get to know much about any of the characters, but that never detracts from the entertainment. The flash back nature of the whole film...is done skillfully. There is a 'no holds barred' honesty here, but some scenes may disturb those who don't like...........lots of blood. Stylish and with great use of music, Tarantino makes an excellent first movie He has gone on to make other top movies.",8,0,0,23 March 2012
Pretty Woman," Too Bad.......To Be True
",If a movie is shown many times every year on Australian Commercial T.V. ...you can be certain ITS BAD. Pretty Woman IS bad.......VERY BAD. It is Hollywood at its most defective. The script is ---awful----Julia Roberts is terrible (jusy a huge mouth with lots of teeth)..and Richard Gere should have known better. The story is about as original as a Waldorf Salad. Why do the programmers in T.V. Australia think there viewers will like this crap ?? over & over year after year. Do they think they are Idiots ?? Well maybe there right. I would rather be sitting in a dentist chair-----listening to the wonderful noise of the drill as it burrows into my enamel....and I feel nauseous--------than watching Pretty Woman. A seriously inadequate movie.,1,9,20,14 April 2012
Some Like It Hot," This Is As Hot As ......We Need It......(Brilliant)
","The great Billy Wilder directs, writes, and has a say in the screenplay of one of the really great comedies. Some Like It Hot is up there in the best five comedies...ever made. Marilyn Munroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are superb as the three leads in this risqué 1959 steam-roller. Wilder did everything to get up the noses of the censors, and was clever enough to get away with all of it. In 1959 men dressing and behaving like ladies...wearing ladies clothes...was dangerous ground to tread on. And the many sub-plots that this brought about were also 'no go' areas. He succeeded just like the T.V. Classic Seinfeld...when they declared 'not that there's anything wrong with that' when they did there great 'sexual preference' episode. In the case of Some Like It Hot...we need to remember...this was 1959. Munroe was always difficult to work with...continually turning up late, and being obviously neurotic. In a famous B.B.C. talk show in the 1970s Curtis described Munroe as a 'fruit cake'. I am sure that was true, but she was wonderful in Some Like It Hot. The movie is a classic.",10,5,6,6 May 2013

Les Misérables," This is where More................really means Les Miz.
","I have seen Les Miserables 3 times as a stage musical. Each time it got a 10...15 minute standing ovation. Many people were crying. I have also read the novel by Victor Hugo (1862). This was a brave attempt by Director Tom Hooper to blend the musical into a sprawling epic film. And so near Oscar time...what a coincidence. When two of the leading characters don't do 'there thing', then it is a struggle. Russell Crowe is simply mis-cast as Javert. His singing voice is not good enough. And--he makes a one dimensional character into a half dimensional one. Amanda Seyfried as Cosette is ....well lets be kind....not good. Her relationship with Marius (Eddie Redmayne) is like two frozen peas trying to get frisky. The cinematography is 'experimental ?' . Like pushing a hand held camera into the singers faces at all key moments. Anne Hathaway will win the Oscar for best supporting actress...and that is fair. Hugh Jackman will probably win for best actor...but playing Jean Valjean is to carry a heavy load. His use of different singing techniques for each song was a wrong decision...disorientating the audience. I feel he saw this as a huge Oscar chance...and went for it. Perhaps....like some beaten athletic runners..he saw the winning post too soon. (some scenes did look hurried...) Certainly... here in Australia ...this has been hyped savagely. Two Australian actors in a huge frenzied 'epic' !!!!!. Hype is a strange beast...you enter the cinema WANTING to keep in step with 'public opinion'. So...you walk out happy. If you want to get the real Les Mis.....See it live on stage. (no hype required)",3,14,28,26 December 2012
Titanic," Watching This........I Got a Sinking Feeling
","Technically this can hardly be faulted. As a spectacle...its very good. For a three hours plus movie it moves along ..OK. There are however, major problems with Titanic. (its NOT un-sinkable !!) The two leads Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio cant sustain a hot romance throughout the entire movie...indeed the chemistry is never quite right between the two.(Di Caprio in particular is 'out of his depth' here) Both actors (even apart from the relationship problem) are not at their best. Perhaps the gigantic nature of the project 'got to them'.The supporting cast play this...like they are on a ship that will hit a huge ice berg. The dialogue is another problem. It lacks any feeling or spontaneity, and some of the language sounds too modern. The hype surrounding this movie before release was incredible (garaunteeing a successful picture) If your happy with technology and amazing special effects...this is your movie. But don't look too close....there are cracks here....",4,7,12,6 July 2012
The Untouchables," No Nonsense Prohibition...De Palma..De Niro..De Very Good
","It is extraordinary how many professional movie reviewers didn't 'get' this movie. This was never meant to be a blow by blow account about what really happened in 1930 during prohibition. This is a stylized depiction of what happened. Its made to be entertaining and commercial...and to make money. It is entertaining ...and it was a huge commercial money maker. The movie is directed really well by Brian De Palma. The script by David Mamet is great. The acting is way above average. Even the normally wooden Kevin Costner, playing Elliot Ness is O.K. Sean Connery deservedly won an Oscar for his great portrayal of Malone. Robert De Niro has a lot of fun --as Capone. The violence is over the top at times, but this is fundamentally an exercise in pleasing the public....filling cinemas. I was entertained by this excellent movie. Sometimes commercial art is valuable. (Andy Warhol)",9,0,1,21 April 2012
Mystic River," This River Runs Deep
","Possibly Clint Eastwoods best directorial effort, this dark- grim story searches the deepest realms of the soul of mankind. And what we discover...is not pretty. Sean Penn won the Academy Award for best actor in the type of strong role that the Academy likes. When Penns daughter is murdered, the fathers attitude of 'there must be vengeance' is primitive yet understandable. The flimsy, confused word of Tim Robbins (Oscar for best supporting actor) wife is good enough for Penn, so Robbins must be assassinated. While cops-- Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne-- are finding the REAL killers, Penn is slaying his mentally fragile boyhood friend. The only thing we can be sure of---as the credits go up--is that there will be more blood, more sadness in this suburb of Boston. My only complaint about this movie...is the script. It is too predictable...too flat.",8,0,0,19 February 2013
All Quiet on the Western Front," The Madness of War.....
","An 82 year old anti-war movie that retains its brilliance...mainly because a lot of care was taken to make it authentic. This looks at the trench warfare of the first world war, the senselessness of human slaughter and in war...there is never glory. There are many images that may stay with you ..years after you watch it. It looks at the war from the German side. That actually makes it more potent as we the viewers engage with these human beings...thrown into a real hell on earth. Their nationality is not the point here. What have we learned from this worst of all wars.? Not much...this was called 'the war to end all other wars' That was true--until the next war. Homo sapiens kill each other in vast numbers. Movies like All Quiet On The Western Front show the true madness of war. A great movie.",10,2,3,2 September 2012
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Lewis......Winning More Oscars
","Its worth seeing this excellent movie .. if only to see Daniel Day Lewis. He won the 2006 Academy Award for his great performance as the grotesque Daniel Plainview .. a man who hated everyone .. and ended up rich and very much alone. His single-mindedness in relation to money, is not so un-common in the real world. This epic movie runs for 122 minutes (it seems shorter) and it pulls no punches as it hammers home some lost truisms. The false prophet Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) has his head smashed in by Plainview who slips into alcoholism 'due to loneliness?'. His final act is to do some good (he thought). He hated all men .. but a false prophet ? That was too much. In a way this is a study in self loathing--a study of the obsession of money--and what it can do to an unbalanced individual.",9,1,2,4 February 2013
To Kill a Mockingbird," Becoming more toothless....As Time Goes By
","To Kill a Mockingbird, made in 1962 and depicting the Alabama of 1932, looks and feels a little shabby today. There is a lack of passion and raw emotion here (Gregory Peck (Atticus Finch) sleep-walks through the whole thing) and, considering the lack of stability of the times, one would expect a lot more rage. However ..it is what it is..and this is a very highly rated movie by a lot of people. It does seem a little pointless to let a man 'get away with murder' at the end of the movie..while the rest of the film..is all about how justice is required by society..no matter what. It has a certain clever aspect to it...going back to something Atticus Finch said early in the film (to his children) 'we don't kill Mockingbirds because they sing so well'. Yes, well the David Duvall character must have whistled wonderfully. I guess there are no Golden Rules.",5,2,5,16 August 2012
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One Hell Of A Movie.....Nicholson At His Very Best
","Its very wrong to over analyze this brilliant movie. All we really need to say is...its entertaining, its funny, and it will toy with your emotions. Jack Nicholson has been a great actor for a long time, but he never got better than this. He got an Oscar for his amazing performance as ex. convict McMurphy...who thinks time spent in a mental hospital will be easier than 'the joint'. He is in for many surprises. Phsychiatric Nurses can be heavy handed with people who have a personality. Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher) the head nurse on his ward, is finding her 'work' boring ...so she engages in a private psychological battle with McMurphy. Its great all the way through, but the final 15 minutes are cinema gold. Those minutes can leave you stunned. Highly recommended for everyone who enjoys classy movies.",10,2,4,31 August 2012
The Last King of Scotland," Should have been.....MUCH.....Better
","Forest Whitaker won an Oscar in 2006 for his portrayal of Idi Amin...the Ugandan President and butcher who killed around 400,000 of his own people. I think Mr. Whitaker was lucky to win (it was not a vintage year for acting). He never really comes to grips with the pure evil of Amin. Its a bit like Will Smith ..when he played Mohammed Ali..simply not good enough. James McAvoy does a good job as the naive Scottish Doctor who goes to Uganda for some fun, and finds a nightmarish 'Political system'. This movie could easily have been made in 1976...as it bumbles along without the necessary tensions required for this type of material. Its strictly a 'one watch' movie.",4,2,3,19 August 2012
The Green Mile," Stephen........King of the Mile
",Only Stephen King could come up with a story like this. I think we need more movies like The Green Mile. Lots of people say its too long...Rubbish !!!Its 3 hours and 9 minutes because it took that long to make this film. Why is the Universe so big ? Because its not small !! Anyway....the acting in this is of the highest quality. The 1930s feel is very authentic. Its so refreshing to have a story where the lines between reality and mysticism are blurred.....where a mouse could have been nominated for an Academy Award. People attend the cinema to escape for a couple of hours (or 3 hours and 9 minutes !) .....this is escapism with ice and a huge twist of 'whatever you want'. Great stuff !!!,9,1,2,23 April 2012
Dark Shadows," Burtons Dark Shadows....Always Look The Same
","After making a really bad Willy Wonka & and a quite terrible Alice in Wonderland, the Tim Burton ----Johnny Depp pairing presents us with the jackpot. A shockingly puerile Dark Shadows. Having interesting sets and lots of make up is not sufficient to make a good motion picture. The use of 'humour' is awful....well worn jokes about the 'fish out of water' theme, and other predictable nonsense & rubbish.....the weak, tired dialogue is simply not good enough. The central story (actually there is no perceptible central story !!) is so badly handled ....this may go down in history in the cult genre of 'one of the worst movies of all time'. This really is Ghastly Gothic Garbage. Tim Burton always gives us lots of heavily made up actors, bad scripts and good looking sets. However, these things become tiresome after a while ....even the Tim Buton 'fans' must see this as a very impotent movie. Take a holiday Mr. Burton. Come back when you have a new idea. We have seen all of this before.",2,155,315,10 May 2012
The Shawshank Redemption," Red........is a.........Free man
","Essentially, The Shawshank Redemption is about the survival of the human spirit---in a colossally adverse situation. The brutality and corruption which goes on in Shawshank Prison...never hits the viewer right between the eyes (like it should). Thats due to the calming tones of our narrator...Morgan Freeman. Mans in-humanity to man....is on full display here...and its this strange mix of violence, upright stoicism and high morality that makes for a heady brew. Lets not under-rate the narration of Morgan Freeman---this was a huge reason why this movie is now considered to be...a Classic. So, why did it bomb when it was released ? Maybe it needs a couple of viewings for all the gears to mesh (Who knows?) My major criticism , is that i thought the two leads needed to be a bit more edgy , a little bit more angry. After all ..they weren't Saints. However, the messages that most people take from this movie are positive (me included). I do not think its a Classic------but it sure is a powerful movie ... and a very good one.",8,0,1,5 March 2012
Paths of Glory," Fantastic.............Movie
",Most 'experts'...call this an anti war movie. But it is much more than that. Here we have the top brass of an army who are very willing to sacrifice their soldiers for there egos...and political gain. It is 1916 (the First World War) and the French are under pressure to take ground from the enemy. The task they are set...is totally impossible. Here we see the very worst and the very best of humanity. Nobility had no place in the hellish trench war-fare of this war. Yet it was there. Kirk Douglas plays the good in the human race. But the evil... (the Hierarchy of his own Countries Generals)...are evil...and much more. Willing to execute there own men...even fire apon them in the the madness of conflict. This is a movie about what lies in us all...GOOD & EVIL. It is also the best ever movie about the complete madness of war. Because of the disturbing reality of this movie...it can only be viewed...occasionally.,10,1,2,13 March 2014
Raging Bull," Over-rated ..........and misjudged
","I cant understand why 'movie critics' and 'movie buffs' find this so perfect. The movie is made realistically (and very well) outside the boxing ring, but inside the ring ? Oh come on !! The fight scenes are the 'theater of the absurd'. Real boxing is NOTHING like this. Its a science --a craft--not a street fight. This is typical Scorsese....over-cooking the violent scenes once again. Its really quite sad----because the film is pretty good. However, people tend to over rate Robert De Niros performance. I think its because he gallantly gained 60lbs. (27 kg) in weight to play the horrible Jake Lamotta (a guy with LOADS of personality defects) in his post boxing career. Putting that weight on was heroic----but forget that and judge his acting. Its nowhere near the heights he reached in Taxi Driver. (Still his finest hour). Martin Scorsese showed great promise in the 1970s--but he has since been disappointing. (Apart from Goodfellas). Scorsese has never made a 10 / 10 movie. He is a flawed movie director......good.......but certainly not very good , and nowhere near great. Its a great shame really-----'he could have been a contender' !!",6,2,7,25 April 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Hopkins creates ......a non vegetarian
","Anthony Hopkins creates a character who is intelligent, calm, calculating, charming and.....he enjoys eating people. (a slight personalty flaw !!). This is a completely compelling man...who loves the 'high arts', is articulate ...is a Doctor...but beef ,pork , chicken and lamb ..just don't 'do it' for him. Dr Lecter needs that pure unmistakable taste of homo sapien. The Lecter persona has become as big as any movie 'legendary character'.(we must remember--of course--he IS a monster !!) The movie does have a few flaws here and there , but Silence of the Lambs is a really great psycho thriller. Made in 1991, it remains a landmark motion picture. Hopkins was born to play Lecter....One feels almost hypnotized when those bright eyes are sparkling (or if he appears hungry).",9,3,5,14 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Go Away ....Rubber Man....and take your Big Ears with you..!!!
","I have never been a Batman fan, and this tripe is why-- I could never invest any emotions into a guy with a rubber suit who has been around too long (cinematically speaking). Frankly--I hope this is really the end of this ridiculously silly idea.(I mean the guy cant even fly !! Not like Superman) I have to say.....on a more positive note......he sure has nice big ears. The franchise could run for ever of course (like Spiderman and the other 'Super Heroes'). Yes there are people around who hang their brain on the front seat and 'actually enjoy' this pure form of garbage. (the script is awful) It says a lot about the decline of the world--wide I.Q. This movie is for those who have baths with their little rubber Batman figures (yes Big Ears CAN swim..!!!!!)----- (and they are...in heaven) Poor Things !!!!!",3,9,35,20 July 2012
Tombstone," Western Non-sense.............For Children ?
","Tombstone is a 'good looking movie''. That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous 'camped up' version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a 'cosmopolitan American Town'. The story of Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, The O.K. corral, Etc. was nothing like this. Maybe this was made for young teenagers...Or maybe this is just a bad movie.",3,12,28,9 December 2012
Ben-Hur," It Remains........The Ultimate........Epic Motion Picture
","A 1959 'epic' directed by one of Americas finest directors, William Wilder. Cecil B.De. Mille had been the great religious epic director, but with Ben Hur, Wilder showed that you need not part the Red Sea...to make a wonderfully epic movie. The main difference between De Mille and Wilder was....De Mille always loved to show over the top scenes....with maximum effect. Some of them worked really well......others flopped badly. Wilder was a superior operator....holding key ...important moments for many extra vital seconds. He also understood his actors better than Cecil. Wilders body of work (Some Like it Hot....Sunset Boulevard Etc.) is vastly superior to De Milles. However, De Mille was a pioneer and should be regarded as a brave front runner. This is one of those old films that everyone should see....if only to demonstrate to-days movies are ....all about CGI...and poor scripts.",9,0,2,27 November 2013
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," The Golden Age of Bad Sequels ..(we don't need a third part)
","Elizabeth--The Golden Age is vastly inferior to the 1998 Elizabeth. Cate Blanchett is still very good as 'the virgin Queen', but ..in essence..its really only more of the same, with a tardy script and some suspect acting. Clive Owen never gets to grips with his role as Sir Walter Raleigh, and is totally unconvincing. There is a lot of history to get through here and scenes that merited more time were rushed. The Spanish Armada was defeated in minutes..!!! It is visually a beautiful movie, and we can expect a final film. (Elizabeth died when she was 70.) Unfortunately i think the 'game is up' for director Shekhar Kapur. His ace card was Elizabeth...and that card has been played.",4,0,0,19 September 2012
The Deer Hunter," The Real Thing
","The question The Deer Hunter provokes is....Can a movie be too real ? The answer is yes. And this is the ONE. Its an automatic ten out of ten, but it would be un-wise to watch this Classic too often. I can only view it..occasionally. The scenes in Vietnam are gut wrenching, and very authentic. All the acting is first class ...and no-one needs to be praised above any of the whole cast. Directed with faultless precision by Michael Cimino this 1978 movie is so classy and timeless. The futility of war is there for all to see. There are 'no rules in war', and this is painfully demonstrated.....by mans inhumanity to man.....in the pure hell, that is war. Its entirely possible that this movie has more emotional impact than ANY other movie. You like it real..?? Watch this.",10,0,1,13 April 2012
Thor: The Dark World," Ridiculously bad......and stupid
","A movie for young adults....between the ages of 14 and 23. Lots of un-coordinated action and a script that is worse than I can possibly describe. The acting is abysmal (and what was Anthony Hopkins doing in this terrible film?) I suppose its an easy pay check for him. Still, he must be a little embarrassed. Super Hero trash , like this is strictly for air-heads. Watching things burst into flames and dumb 'heroes' pretending to be heroic is idiotic. These awful movies are for the brain dead. Or should I say the living dead. If you are above 25 years old, and you go to see flicks like this---you need treatment....of a psychiatric nature. (3 points)",Null,20,156,29 October 2013
Amélie," Amelie is Magical------great cinema !!!!
","During the last 25 years America has been making awful ROM-COMs. Unfortunately they have no ROM & no COM. What we have here is a French offering, that is very ROMY & extremely COMY. The main difference is that Amelie is-----ORIGINAL (and has lots of ROM & COM.) The 'star' performer here is Audrey Tautou...who looks like she comes from another planet. She has bucket-fulls of sex appeal...and an unbelievable mischievousness that makes us love her. The cinematography here is exquisite, the use of colour very imaginative. Tatou is completely convincing as the girl who is 'away with the fairies' in the nicest possible way. This is a piece of cinematic magic. It has to be revered, and it has to be appreciated......Simply Brilliant",9,3,7,1 May 2012
Munich," A black hole for Spielberg
",Steven Spielberg (in Munich) tells us the hate between Israel and the Arabs will never end...also....the hate between Israel and the Palastine people will never end. We all know that. He tells us that conflict is not a pretty thing. We all know that. He shows us that bullets kill people and bombs blow up...and are dangerous. We all know that. The movie Munich is like a black hole.....even time is destroyed. The film is too long...and not very interesting. Everything is so dark so very hopeless. We do however get a profound remark every 20 minutes or so...to keep the boredom at bay. The acting is O.K. but this is not Spielberg at his best. The plodding pace of Munich is (at times) excruciatingly tedious. Perhaps he should stick to action flicks like Jaws. Forget about the Jews ---for a while.,5,0,5,19 April 2012
Jackie Brown," Could be Tarantinos Best................
","To-day, Thurs. 10th Jan. 2013-- the IMDb ' reviewers' gave Reservoir Dogs ..8.4..Pulp Fiction 9.0 and Jackie Brown ..7.6. That is pretty remarkable. You can watch Pulp Fiction while reading War and Peace---and 'get' the whole thing. You can watch Reservoir Dogs while building your Nuclear shelter out-back...and always know whats going on. The sad thing about Jackie Bown is---you need to concentrate on the dialogue if you want to understand it. It appears movie goers just want to stuff pop-corn down there faces...(or preferably hand fed). R.D & P.F. are both well made movies, but a brainy orang utang could understand them. Jackie Brown is an excellent caper movie---much better than those Oceans 12..13..14 ETC. It is extremely under-rated",9,1,3,9 January 2013
Gangs of New York," Lewis----The Only Shining Light-----in Martins Mess
","A big mess of a movie. The performance of Daniel Day Lewis saves it from being ..a very bad movie. Its only ..bad. It must have been hell for Leonardo Di Caprio ..trying to 'mix it' with a REAL actor. If it was Martin Scorses s plan to make everything appear fake....imitation, he succeeded. The viewer always painfully aware he is watching a movie. Perhaps Mr. Scorsese tried for too much. The big grizzly, bloody opening sequence is ...ridiculously contrived. Almost funny. Any scene with Day Lewis is worth watching. He makes Bill the Butcher a hugely colorful character. His command of the role is brilliant. The less we say about 'the others' the better. All of them appeared like lab rats running around big sets----hoping no-one was watching them. Di Caprio must have been praying to be back on the Titanic. Sinking here must have been .. embarrassing. The end sequence was like the Keystone Cops (only funnier) Calling it the end is being nice. It was a............HUGE..............cop out. Don't try one of these again...Mr. Scorsese",2,2,6,5 March 2012
Moon," Rockwell.............Fails to Deliver
","A movie with a profound...yet simple message. This is the first feature film directed by Duncan Jones (the son of David Bowie). When we 'get' the rather obvious story line....we need to have a sharp script to push it along. Alas the script is ordinary----so we wait patiently to see how this is going to end. I think the end was rushed (this---remember is a low budget flick). Sam Rockwell was not an inspired choice to have the lead role here. He is in 98% of scenes, and he fails to have the magic quality that great actors have. Call it the..X..factor...call it anything. Jude Law may have been the best choice. It is a highly regarded movie...But as a science fiction film...it is a million light years behind Kubriks 2001..A Space Odyssey. Made in 1968.",4,4,12,10 October 2013
True Romance," Really.....This is Fake Romance
","A movie that is well acted (Dennis Hoppers cameo is brilliant), but its a movie aimed at a peculiar audience. Quite simply...life is not like this...a Mickey Mouse cartoon is nearer to the truth. There is a lot of blood, a lot of killing (which leads to dead bodies.) The 'loving' relationship is as fake as relationships can get. This is a world which may exist on a parallel Universe, and thats fine. By the end, I realized i had been watching a film which had dared me to become a believer. I could never believe in this type of slaughter. And all over some white powder. This strangely synthetic movie made a lot of money at the box office. What does that mean? There are a lot of odd, lonely people in the world.",4,5,11,11 February 2013
The Social Network," Socialising for Lonely Sad People
","The irony of the Social Network is....The guy who invented Facebook obviously had a reasonably high I Q. Yet the people who use it (you know those people who use the word 'awesome' over and over and over..etc. etc.) have I.Q.s bordering on mentally challenged. Those poor things believe they have an average of 130 'friends !!'. They are the loneliest critters on the planet. Anyway--this is a slick flick. Not a good movie but perfect for all the Facebook fans who went along to see it. Jesse Elsenberg is brilliant playing the horrible, distasteful Mark Zuckerberg. It did well at the box office, and must have made a fortune from the placement of well known bottles of beer. Strictly a movie that does not require multiple viewings....and a few years from now ...it will be forgotten.",3,6,12,20 September 2012
The Great Gatsby," The book was so GREAT........This movie was so terrible
","This is really awful. There is so much wrong with this rubbish...one could write a book about it. Mixing modern music with 1920s music? Hey Baz Luhrmann (director)----cant you live without CGI and additional nonsense??? The 1974 version was not great...........but it was in so many ways much better than this drivel. Robert Redford was a real Gatsby ...his use of the upper class language was 100% better than DiCaprios .....who never got the Gatsby character (he was terrible). Bruce Dern, Sam Waterston, Karen Black, Scott Wilson.....the 1974 supporting cast...... were far superior to this 2013 rabble. The director Baz Luhrmannm came to Australia recently to promote this insult to Scott Fitzgerald on the television media and said he was retiring soon. He needs to. O.K.....Old Sport ?....Fitzgerald would have hated this. He would have also disliked the 4 previous movie attempts at this work. Leave Gatsby alone movie makers----or call in the A team of directors. (and actors)",1,64,117,22 June 2013
The Proposal," If You Don't Intend To Watch Or Listen To This......Its O.K.
","This is a dreadful movie. There are no laughs here....none. Sandra Bullock is truly awful as she over-acts and speaks faster than a speeding bullet. The actual story has been done--in one way or another--more times than Oprah has been on a diet. Julia Roberts was first choice to play the Bullock role, but wanted more money. The interesting thing about Bullock movies is they normally make money. This utter rubbish made money !! I am not so sure it would have had the box office success with Roberts. The cinema going audience (who enjoy rom-coms) will go to see Bullock in ANY rom-com. Even this. There has never been a funny rom-com. A friend of mine told me they are actually 'date movies', so no one is really watching. That sounds like it MUST be true. (After all..There will be Blood..doesn't sound like a date movie).",1,6,10,13 February 2013
Up in the Air," Clooney Flies High
","It only runs for 105 minutes, but Up In The Air feels even shorter. This is a fine piece of entertainment .. with more messages here than in 20 mobile phones. George Clooney is great in his rather 'Oliver Cromwell' type role of--sacking people.(giving people the chop!!) He flies all over America doing the dirty work for corporations that are too queasy for that kind of thing. He virtually lives in the air. He likes his work, and he is also a motivational speaker. The movie revolves around him,,,his romances,,,his family (he is un-married),,,his relationships Etc. There are good one liners here..and much more fun and intelligence than in most movies of to-day. The supporting cast (particularly the sexy Vera Farmiga) are all great.",8,0,1,4 October 2012
Atonement," Classic Novel-----------Average Movie
","A huge production of Ian McEwans great novel, this is like a cheese omelette (without the cheese)...a beef stroganoff (without the beef)...a big Mac...(without the patties). This is a movie that simply...does not satisfy...one feels one has ate a huge meal..yet still feels empty. The two leads James McAvoy and Keira Knightly are very good. The direction is also well above average. It is one of those annoying 'stiff upper lip' British flicks that doesn't cut the mustard. (Whats that old boy ??..!!) Yes OK life is full of personal tragedies, but the complexity of the mistake that a 13 year old child makes (in extreme circumstances) is sad...sure, but not a sin. Somehow it is she who i feel sorry for. She was a girl becoming sexually aware, who also had a crush on her big sisters lover. What she did had huge ramifications ...but i don't see how a girl of her age (in a 1935 English country setting) could know anything about adult emotions. And that is the problem...in the book it is all made very clear. Some novels should NOT be made into movies....this is one.",4,4,8,14 May 2012
The Godfather," Copollas Grand Entry--------and its Perfect
","Francis Ford Coppola was 33 years old in 1972. That was the year of The Godfather. Coppola raised the bar---in relation to directing a movie. Things in movie land would never be the same. This was a great craftsman at work...and The Godfather became a land mark movie. Other films would be compared to the real thing, and very few got anywhere near this original Classic. Its now 40 years later, and were still waiting for a real challenger. Of course--its not going to happen. A movie like The Godfather could never be made today. We have directors who don't care to even try !! I understand that. It would require vision and a rich talent that skips several generations. It was Coppola who refused to back down when the studio brass wanted Ernest Borgnine for the lead role. He demanded Brando. He got Brando. Brando was great. This is one of those rare movies where all the planets align-----and everything works perfectly. Acting, screen play, music, etc.etc. Hell....even the best boy was the best, best boy in history !!",10,1,4,14 April 2012
