Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Long and boring at times, all over the place at others, The first three were better!! 3D made the film worth watching.
","This one just didn't do it for me. This is one of those movies where the 3D was the best part about the movie. Jonny Depp was good and the acting wasn't all that bad. It was nice to see AL Capone from Board Walk Empire in there as a different role. Mermaids were cool and they entertained me enough to not completely close my eye lids. Some funny parts, but over all the movie is not a movie I could watch twice. It was long at times, everyone was glad when it was over, and when the movie ended, there wasn't any applause from people like most Friday nights of a new movie release. If your a die hard fan like me, you should enjoy some old things mentioned from previous films and the comedic genius of Johnny Depp, but this wasn't a good enough movie to watch again. I hope I was helpful and I hope ya take it for what it's worth.",3,4,8,21 May 2011
Drive," A story of Morals. You should be proud to be an American after watching this film!!
","I gave it at 9 because it is very Very slow at times. Kinda overkill! This film is definitely a cinematic masterpiece!! Gosling, although soft spoken at times, is brilliant! This is one of those movies that you can't be tired and watch, but if your wide awake, it's one of the best movies to come out in quite some time! It had the Martin Scorsese vibe several times but also a nice twist of additional excellent directing. Go See it, Go see it, and oh yeah... by the way... GO SEE IT!! Very funny movie as well! Do not take kids, waste of money, and not appropriate. Anyone under 13 probably would not get the message and fall asleep mid way through. Adults will love it! However not for everyone, one of the greatest films these past few years.",8,2,7,17 September 2011
