It," Y'know.... enh.
","The Shining was the only Stephen King story that worked for me. Everything else has always been a let down. Including this. It was so hyped. From the looks of it, it looked like it was going to be a solid horror film that did it different. To me, it was very formulaic and actually kind of clichÃ©. It may just be me but everyone talked it up so much that I thought I was going to be blown away but no. There is no psychological horror. The film consists of jump scares. There is nothing else. It doesn't stick. The teenagers in the auditorium stood up and clapped but I just didn't get it. The movie is not terrible. The kids were actually very great in their roles and added a lot of humor to the movie but if you're looking for scares this really isn't it. The movie relies on gross out makeup and jump scares to keep it moving and doesn't deliver. The special effects are not bad but there are points in the film where a should-be terrifying moment was actually very silly and laughable. Pretty much all of it was given away in the trailer. The best scene is when Pennywise comes out of the water in the cellar but you already saw that. It definitely won't scare you on DVD if it doesn't scare you in the theaters. The movie isn't bad but it leaves a little more to be desired. Don't expect too much. 6/10",5,26,52,10 September 2017
