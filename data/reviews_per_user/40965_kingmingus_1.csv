Sucker Punch," Why, Oh Why?
","First of all, why was it called Sucker Punch? That name didn't seem to make any sense to me unless I missed something.I say this to everyone I mention this film to. If you do go and see it, only go for the intro. It's the best bit and I must say, some of the best editing of picture and soundtrack I've seen in ages. Only because that part seemed to have any form of character development. Other than that, I think the writer thought, 'Well, Baby Doll's introduced. Let's just have the others spring up out of nowhere'. That's pretty much what happens.There is another great scene in the film as well. It's called the end credits.This film was too SFX dependent in my eyes. Obvious references to films and games were abundant as well. Even with an extremely cringe worthy western style reference when one of the girls died. The whole 'Tell Mama I love her' crap.The plot was that Baby Doll wanted to escape and four other girls thought 'I'll go with you'. They needed five items. A map, fire (a lighter), a key, something else that I forget, and the final one is a mystery that turns out to be Baby Doll herself. How the hell she realised that in the end, I don't know.Major plot holes in this film.DON'T WATCH IT UNLESS YOU'RE DOING IT ONLINE!!!",1,7,14,14 April 2011
