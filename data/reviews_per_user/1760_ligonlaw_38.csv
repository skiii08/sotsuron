The King's Speech," Oscar, Oscar, Oscar
","When Edward VIII abdicated the throne of England in favor of his love for a twice-married American woman, George VI became heir to the throne. The film begins with a painful excerpt of a radio address he had given earlier. His stammer and lisp made for excruciating listening. George VI is played by Colin Firth who must be a front- runner in the Oscar balloting for Best Actor, for good reason. The King took the throne at a time when radio was new; it was live and there was no editing. He had a horrible stammer, and the frightful prospect of speaking to millions of people over the radio made his speech impairments worse. Geoffrey Rush plays a speech therapist who befriends George and works with him. The sessions between the commoner and the king are excellent. Rush's acting skills are considerable, as are Firth's, but this may be his finest hour. As the unflappable therapist, he allows the king's rage and frustration to wash over him while he is steadfast in his purpose: to cure the stammer. The scrip is filled with tasty tidbits of humor. Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as patient and caring wife of the king, whose counsel he accepts. This is probably the Best Picture of the year because of the script, the performances, the direction, costumes, cinematography and editing.",10,1,3,11 January 2011
Black Swan," Metamophosis to Dark Perfection
","Disturbing story of a ballerina who wins the role of Queen of the Swans in the New York production of Swan Lake scored by Tchaikovsky. The role requires the prima ballerina to embody polar opposite personalities. The white is pure and virginal; the black swan is dark and a seductress.Natalie Portman plays the dancer who must undergo the theatrical metamorphosis. The dancer so assimilates the character that she undergoes a personal metamorphosis with tragic consequences.I have been smitten by her work ever since she played the child who lived with the hit man in The Professionals. I have thought that that performance was so perfect that she might not ever reach a similar level of excellence again in her career. She was stunning in Closer where she was on the same stage with Julia Roberts, Clive Owen and Jude Law. She stole that film from some of our finest actors. The film itself was not as fine as Black Swan.The Black Swan is great because Ms. Portman was great in it. The film is quite disturbing and dark. Ms. Portman is entirely convincing as a ballerina; her features and physique are flawless. Her classic beauty, her youth and innocent demeanor are a natural for the white swan. The difficult transition, for the dancer, is to become the dark twin. This transition is painful for her, and it is the subject of the film. The film has a Kafkaesque quality as she begins to literally grow black feathers.The Black Swan is one of the great performances by an actress ever in film. Natalie Portman never disappoints but, in the Black Swan, she achieves perfection.",10,2,4,11 January 2011
Changeling," His Excellence Mr. Eastwood
","Whether there will be a better picture released in these last few weeks of 2008 remains to be seen, but this is the first truly excellent big budget film I have seen so far. After making fun westerns which became cultural icons, Clint Eastwood turned to various action films including San Francisco Inspector Callahan who uttered memorable lines like: 'Go ahead, Punk. Make my day.' His films garnered good box office but not critical acclaim. Beginning with 'Unforgiven,' Eastwood's name became synonymous with excellence in film making.Anyone asked to be in one of his projects would be a fool to turn it down, because it virtually assures Oscar consideration. No director in this decade has had more actors nominated by the Academy. No director has scored more wins for cast and crew in recent years. This string of wins will continue with this film. Angelina Jolie has made a lot of money at the box office since her Oscar win in 2000 with 'Girl Interrupted.' Since then, Ms. Jolie has become a female version of James Bond in action films like 'Laura Croft' or 'Gone in 60 Seconds,' where she is a tough, sexy chick who can drive fast, shoot straight, kick ass, and rumble with the bad guys. She fits the fantasy in these films, but it strains credulity to believe she can always defy physics, gravity and reality to perform these super heroic deeds. She has played some serious roles involving some unfortunate accents which are hard to pin down geographically including 'Alexander' where she played a Persian with some kind of Slavic thing happening. As the wife of Daniel Pearl last year, she attempted a French accent with some success.In this film, she gets an opportunity to portray a mom who is looking for her lost son. Under Eastwood's direction, she becomes the actress she was born to be.The film takes place in L.A. in the 1920s and early 1930s, a small town with trolley cars, modest homes, and T Model cars. The film is like a time machine recreating the past in great detail. With gorgeous cinematography, a tight script, excellent acting and excellent art direction, this film would be the first contender for multi-category wins at the Oscars.There is one more Eastwood touch to this film which deserves mention. Eastwood is a musician. {If you get the chance, watch his installment of the Scorcese history of the blues where Eastwood sits with Ray Charles and chats with him about music and musicians. I could have watched those two old guys for hours, but the segment runs only a few minutes. Charles died a few months after he appeared in the film.) Film scores are background music often unnoticed. The subtle connection between sound and emotion operates at the edge of the sub-conscious. The wonderful score by Eastwood could be one of the finest scores you were never supposed to hear. Moving jazz undertones with an elegant saxophone rising to the surface on occasion strikes the perfect emotional connection between sound and light.In a business that caters to the young, half a century of experience stands out. Mr. Eastwood knows what he is doing.",10,6,10,12 November 2008
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the Best Films of 2012
","Wow. I wait all year long for the release of movies like this one that are headed for the awards season.The 'Perks of Being A Wallflower' has so much about it that was right and excellent it is hard to know where to start. Steven Chbosky adapted his novel into the fine script. His direction was also excellent. Logan Lerman plays a 16-year-old turning 17. A freshman in high school who is recovering from some traumatic event which causes him to experience flashbacks.The film takes us to high school in the 1980s, and the soundtrack revisits the music of the era. Music is integral to the characters as Logan's character, Charlie, creates mixes on cassettes for his friends. Charlie struggles to breathe in the claustrophobic world of high school, where he is alone, alienated and introverted. He finds two seniors who are odd ducks, and they form an immediate and intimate bond.Charlie reminds us of Salinger's Holden Caulfiend, a sensitive, observant youth from the 1950s. The film cuts as deeply into the minds of these eighties kids, as did 'The Catcher in the Rye' for an earlier generation.Funny and sad. The acting is terrific. This is clearly one of the best films we will see this year.",10,4,9,9 November 2012
Gravity," One Hell of a Ride
","A series of catastrophic problems beset a NASA mission orbiting earth. As a first-time astronaut, Sandra Bullock, playing Dr. Ryan Stone, learns from veteran Spaceman George Clooney, playing Matt Kowalski, valuable survival tips. This film will keep you on the edge of your seat. The cinematography is astonishing. No cast of thousands, as you often expect from space films. For most of the film, there are only one or two characters. Sandra Bullock, who won her first Oscar for Blindside, is a favorite for her performance in this film. Bullock's performance is comparable to Tom Hank's 'Cast Away,' a film he carried almost alone. Gravity is a must-see movie.",9,2,4,9 January 2014
Midnight in Paris," Woody Is Back
","There was a time when I used to say: 'Even a bad Woody Allen movie is better than most films.' And I think I have seen them all - liking some films better than the critics. His recent films have been less and less interesting as he has produced scripts which recycled really old jokes of his own. Many themes come back again and again without new insight and without being very funny with the retelling. There were the familiar characters in different bodies and tired, stale material. Woody was becoming the writer/director who was once great.Midnight in Paris is the old Woody with fresh material. Owen Wilson looks the fresh-faced American he is. Gone are the elderly male coupled with the too-young young female leads. Wilson plays a successful Hollywood writer going through a career crisis. He wants so much to be an important writer of fiction - not a Hollywood hack. He adores the vision of Paris in the twenties, the 'Moveable Feast' years. His bride- to-be, played by Rachel McAdams, wants a successful man who will provide a nice life. Her parents are in Paris and she wants a life like theirs. The Wilson character is a restatement of the Fitzgerald dilemma: easy money for lousy scripts versus time-consuming exhaustive effort to create important fiction.There are some hilarious lines when the four get together. It was worth watching the film for those scenes alone.There is an 'Alice in Wonderland' plot twist which takes Wilson's character down the rabbit hole and back into the Paris he yearns to experience. Suddenly he is hobnobbing with the Fitzgeralds, drinking with Hemingway, flirting with Picasso's mistress and meeting the Who's Who of the Lost Generation. Gertrude Stein reads his novels and suggests changes. He is living his dream at night. He returns to the present during the day.Maybe I liked the film so much because I would like to take that ride back into time. There is a trite lesson about the fallacy of thinking that any age is a Golden Age. There are some predictable resolutions to the story, but, all in all, it is a fun film. Woody has gotten his chops back. The material is fresher, more interesting and better than he has produced in a long, long while. We have seen many films which display a love of the City of Paris. Woody adores Paris and shows us why we should love it too. It's not a hard sell. Paris is every bit as lovely as described, but he takes us to an even better place.",8,2,6,4 June 2011
The Hateful Eight," Lengthy Disappointment
","Quentin Tarantino has created another category of film, like Woody Allen. You know what to expect, and the film will deliver more or less what you were expecting. A Tarantino film is expected to be especially violent and harsh. The Hateful Eight runs 2 hours and 47 minutes, and it unfolds slowly, as you brace yourself for the inevitable bloodbath. In this film, the violence comes but not immediately.The film resembles a stage play in that most of the dialogue and action take place in a single room called Minnie's Haberdashery. There are outside shots purporting to be a snowy Wyoming. The cinematography is excellent.My problem is with the script, the language and the thinly drawn characters. The reasons for the shedding of much blood are varied. Some are blown away for racial reasons. Others are blown away for economic reasons. Some are blown away for revenge. Some of are poisoned so that they puke blood on the floor and on the faces of each other. We don't get to know these characters well enough to feel hatred for them. So when they are dispatched from this earth we don't feel any real emotions. They are in a Tarantino film and you know there will be bloodshed. When it happens, you aren't shocked and you don't feel the loss of them. They are, for the most part, unlikeable characters or stone cold killers.This is Tarantino's eighth film, and he has made better ones, and some much worse. You roll the dice with Tarantino. Sometimes you get something brilliant like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Django' and sometimes you get beheadings and a fountain of blood showering the scene and an irritating revision of history like 'Inglorious Basterds.'Not his best work.",6,11,37,22 December 2015
Fast & Furious 6," The Laws of Physics Do Not Apply
","If you want mindless action, there are many better movies to watch. This movie is aimed at the youth market, primarily boys who play video games. The script is off-putting for several reasons: 1. the franchise has gone past the street racing story that made the first several installments fun to watch. The sixth film has become more James Bond than East L.A. The world must be saved from evil geniuses who will possess Doomsday military hardware unless Dom and his crew stop them. This premise takes the story away from California and off to Moscow, Macau, London, and Spain where the team works with a unit of the U.S. government. 2. The dialog is leaden. The main characters speak in philosophical nuggets. As one might expect from the spy genre, they did not scrimp on special effects, explosions or computer graphics. Because of the number of sequels, the dialog is filled with nostalgic references to the past. One should have seen the prior films in order to understand all the references. The sappy references to the past are overdone. Dom's men live by a code - something about keeping the family together. The team is not only saving the world, they are saving Letty who is in the clutches of the evil geniuses who will destroy the world. Apparently, she didn't die in a prior sequel, but she does suffer from amnesia. These are the standard plot devises of soap opera fare. The film runs a little long, but there is no stretch of film that rings true. Boys who love video games might like this film, but the story is lame and the massive expense for special effects could have supported the making of a dozen good movies. It's a dud.",2,1,3,15 December 2013
The Book Thief," The Best Film of 2013
","'The Book Thief' is a beautifully crafted motion picture. The cinematography is magnificent. The acting is extraordinary. The directing is excellent. The Book Thief looks at World War II from a child's point of view. The political world is somewhere else. The war penetrates everyday life in the Germany village, but it is an unwelcome intrusion. As adults, we can fill in the historical context, but the characters do not know the big picture. They are busy trying to get past the inconvenience of war and resume a mundane existence.Wonderful performance by Geoffrey Rush, as the warm, genial foster parent. Emily Watson plays a cranky, cantankerous hausfrau whose bark is worse than her bite. Most of the film is told from the point of view of Liesl, played by Sophie Nélisse, an extremely talented 12-year-old actress. The camera loves her. Her best friend is Rudy played by Nico Liersch. Together they take us away from the war and back into childhood.The John Williams score is beautiful.",10,3,9,8 January 2014
American Sniper," Sniper MIssed
","The problem with biographical material is illustrated in American Sniper. There are too many facts. Clint Eastwood is one of the finest directors, and Bradley Cooper is a great actor, and this is a good enough film. Chris Kyle was a real Navy SEAL who, in fact, holds the record for being the deadliest sniper to ever serve The United States.With more than 160 confirmed kills to his credit and perhaps as many as 200 total kills, Chris Kyle's bravery and accuracy are beyond reproach, and as he told his VA shrink, he can face his God with a clear conscience. The story is very matter of fact and runs through essential parts of his life as if each part of it must be told. He served four tours in Iraq, but we witness only a few of his kills. We understand his need to protect his comrades in arms, and we respect his willingness to take great personal risk in that effort. Still, there isn't enough tension in the story. 'Lone Survivor' dealt with the same kind of material, and even though the title tells you what will happen, there is much tension in that story. There are a couple of scenes where Kyle struggles with the moral question of being a sniper and having to shoot someone who poses a threat, but doesn't fit the standard profile of an enemy combatant. These add depth, but he is in and out of the theater quickly. So quickly that tension and intensity are not allowed to build. He is in mortal danger, then he is home with his family, then back in mortal danger.A better script would have stayed in the intense moments and not been so concerned with the four tours. Finally, there is the problem of the ending. Incredibly, Kyle is murdered after he survives four tours in Iraq. He is murdered by a veteran, but that large, question-begging, ironic event is all-but dismissed in the film. It is a caption attached to the last scene.The film is good enough. It tells a great American hero story, but there was a better story in this material. It missed for me.",7,13,50,3 December 2014
Rush," Having an Enemy Can be a Blessing
","Rush covers the world championship in Formula One racing in the 1970s when two drivers dominated the sport: James Hunt of England driving a McLauren and Niki Lauda, an Austrian who drove for Ferrari. The two men had a lot in common. They were fortunate sons of wealthy families. They were obsessed with winning. While Hunt was a playboy, he was willing to die on the race track to gain a split-second advantage over his competition. Lauda spoke of cutting risk, which he could quantify, but he accepted the risk of tragic consequences of piloting race cars at insane speeds.If you like auto racing, you will love this story. The story contrasts how Lauda and Hunt were different. Lauda was a serious person who never worried about people liking him. He called everyone an 'asshole.' He was extremely frank and lacked any form of tact. Hunt was handsome, fun- loving, drunk and utterly charming. The desire to be better than the other man drove them to excel. Where once they really didn't like each other, they become more than rivals. Wonderful film. See it.",9,1,1,10 January 2014
The Revenant," Extremely Violent, Harsh World Without Much Dialogue
","'The Revenant' should be rewarded for beautiful cinematography during the awards season. It is difficult to understate the gore and graphic violence on display. In the early going, the trapper played by Leonard DiCaprio is nearly eaten by a bear, and his throat is mauled. Thereafter, there is almost no dialogue from him. This film takes place in the western U.S. in the 1820s and purports to be a true tale about an adventurer named Hugh Glass.The director does not shy away from any of the bloody cruelty suffered by the protagonist. The environment is hostile because both man and beast are ferocious. Men are vicious and untrustworthy. Adding to the unintelligible dialogue are the native American dialects which were spoken (with subtitles.)Even though we witness terrific violence and slaughter, the carnage is laid out as simply factual. We know little about the lead character except that he has a strong survival instinct. It reminded me of work by Terrence Malick - the minimization of dialogue and the lack of human connectedness.",6,1,4,8 January 2016
Coriolanus," Timeless Story of Political Intrigue
","Filmed partly in Serbia, 'Coriolanus' has the dingy, fog-shrouded feel of the mists of time. Coriolanus is a roman military hero, played by Ralph Fiennes, and portrayed as a violent, blood-thirsty animal in battle scenes. Off the battlefield, he is a rage-filled misanthrope.Blood-smeared and courageous, he charges forward against all odds when in combat, taking his injuries in stride. Each of his scars (all 27) represents a dead enemy, Menenius (played excellently by Brian Cox) whispers to Coriolanus's young son. Coriolanus has anger management issues, to say the least. Incapable of containing his contempt for the people, he wins no friends off the battlefield when some Senators wish to elevate the soldier to political office. With seething contempt for false speech and his inability to curb a brutal tongue, he is doomed as enters the arena of politics. His political enemies set a trap for him at a televised political event. When a live audience chants for Coriolanus to be banished, Menenius tries to reason with the mob. He asks the mob to remember that the general devoted his life to protecting Rome from invasion by her enemies.The rejection so embitters Coriolanus that he leaves Rome and joins the enemy forces. These were the forces he fought in the beginning of the story. The rebels are led by Tullus Afidious, played by Gerard Butler. Butler is perfectly cast as the rebel leader. Coriolanus and Tullus had so much hatred for each other that their men had laid down their arms to watch the two generals engage in what would have been a knife fight to the death, except that an explosion interrupted the brawl.The driving relationship in this killer's life is a devout worship of his mother, played by Vanessa Redgrave. She controls his opinions and fires his ambitions. This bloody general, so feared by his enemies, is a mama's boy. Her wrath brings him to tears and to his knees. As with so much of Shakespeare, the language is timeless, and these speeches resonate with relevance. One can apply these conversations to public events in the current era.Excellent acting, directing, and camera work.",9,16,24,1 January 2012
Warrior," The Guilty Pleasure of Watching Brains Being Beaten Out
","This movie runs slightly more than 2 and a half hours, but it never bores.Nick Nolte plays the alcoholic father who is about to celebrate 1,000 days clean and sober when we meet him. His portrayal of the flawed, sometimes pathetic, old drunk is just about perfect.His sons are, for various complicated reasons, mixed martial arts fighters who end up competing for a large purse in the Sparta Match held in Atlantic City. About half the movie takes place at the match.The acting throughout is excellent, and, the direction is also very fine. One supporting cast member who deserves mention is Frank Grillo, who I have never seen. He steals scenes when he is on camera. He was so convincing as a MMA trainer that I checked his bio to find out if he was a fighter. He's an actor, and a good one.The script bristles with good lines. While the story becomes fairly predictable early on and there are many scenes which are recycled from other similar movies, the story and the pace are rewarding. There were some glaring errors and inconsistencies in the script or in the editing which didn't ruin the story, but did detract from it. At one point, to save time, a series of elimination rounds are strung together. They were incidental to the plot. That section went too long for me. If the rounds weren't that important, shorter cuts or a another technique might have been more effective. There is a mixture of mortal combat and soap operatic family conflict which, if the soapiness were toned down a little, would have worked better. The relationship between the two brothers is compelling, but, to nitpick, they don't really look like family members. 2011 has been, so far, a lean year for meaty fare. The big money has been concentrated even more into kid-stuff blockbusters than in past years. This film could get critical attention and should be around for awards. Like the Rocky series, the fight scenes are the main event, and you find yourself rooting for the fighters. This was a pleasant surprise. The cast, except for Nolte, was an ensemble of unknown or lessor known actors. This is one of those films which offer these non-A-list actors a chance to break out, and, without exception, the performances were great.See it. It's a knock out.",5,1,3,17 December 2011
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Very Funny with Music You Can Move it, Move it to
","There were a lot of really young children in the theater when we saw this film Friday. My theory is that if the movie is louder than the talkers, they will give up eventually. That works with teenagers, but small children do not watch or follow the story, so they keep on chattering. I wonder why parents of infants bring them to the movies at all.There is some humor which would be inappropriate for children if they could understand double entendres, but since they are not adults, they do not get those jokes. There is something to amuse the adults while entertaining the children with innocent fun. Children think butts are hilarious, and any humor relating to butts will send them over the edge. What makes this movie fun is the great animation, cute characters, and a script that makes them likable. The story creates caring relationships, and it is heart warming without being cloying. The script is clean and crisp, and the jokes work. The voices of stars make a huge difference. Puss in Boots by Antonio Banderas made 'Shrek' a funnier series. Ellen Degeneris was better in 'Finding Nemo' than she has ever been in anything in her life. She made the Nemo a much better movie. There are wonderful voices in 'Madagascar Escape 2 Africa.' Sasha Baron Cohen, as the voice of Julien, the delusional king of the lemurs, is a fabulous addition to this series. He is funny every time you see him. Chris Rock is the voice of all the Zebras, and he is always funny. Cedric the Entertainer plays Maurice, some kind of Furby, who is a toady to Julien; and Bernie Mac plays Zuba in one of his last performances before a premature death. The characters come alive with their voices.Will i Am is new to the series, and he is excellent as the voice of the king of the Hippos, Moto Moto. The film is infused with a driving rhythm which makes you tap your toes. Many of the great songs are by Will i Am. Usually not much of a rap fan, I found the music terrific and will get this soundtrack for Will i Am's songs.This is a fun, funny, upbeat movie. Take the kids, if they are 5 or older, and go along with them. There will be something for the grown-ups to enjoy too.",9,4,8,16 November 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," One of the Best Films of 2012
","This is one of the best films of 2012. There will be awards nominations for deserved excellence. Excelsior! The Weinstein Company has become the Oscar brand name for award-winning performances, as excellence and quality seem to be the only criteria for the producers.The real surprise for me was Bradley Cooper, who always plays the funny, handsome guy in movies like 'The Hangover,' 'The Hangover Part 2' and 'The Hangover Infinite Sequel.' Here, Cooper plays a disturbed man who is released from a mental facility. He has some court problems and a restraining order or two hanging over him. He plays the edgy, off-his-meds guy very convincingly. This is a good film for him. He shows us things we have never seen him do.Robert DeNiro is always interesting and fun to watch. He plays Cooper's father, an OCD Philidelphia Eagles fan who performs a series of strange rituals while watching his team. He worries about the team's Mojo constantly, and bets heavily and dangerously on them.The characters are all wonderfully quirky in this script. The question of sanity is explored in an unusual way. We know, at the outset, that Cooper's character is more than a little bit off his rocker, but as the story progresses, we see an entire cast of characters who have their own issues. Cooper plays Pat, who was sentenced to the mental hospital after an incident involving his wife. He wants desperately to get back his old life, but we see how unlikely he is to recover what was lost. We see that his obsessiveness, which caused the incident, is driving him harder to make things right. We know it will not work. His friends and family watch him make the same mistakes again and again.Jennifer Lawrence, as good as she was in 'Hunger Games,' really creates a new character in this film. You can't take your eyes off her when she is on the screen. She is a combination of crazy, sexy and intense. She erupts out of nowhere and virtually stalks Pat through the first half of the film. She is funny, also obsessive and equally as intense as Pat.The script is excellent, and, even though the ending is telegraphed too far in advance, the film goes where you want the story to go.This is one of the best films of 2012. There will be awards nominations for deserved excellence. Excelsior! The Weinstein Company has become the Oscar brand name for award-winning performances, as excellence and quality seem to be the only criteria for the producers.",10,3,7,25 December 2012
The Commitments," A Cautionary Tale about Bands and Egos
","There so much to love about this movie, and I am watching it on television 18 years after I saw it for the first time. In the meantime, I was in a band and could see that there are parallel processes of coming together to make a great sound and dissolving internally due to personality conflicts, artistic differences and egotism.The story of the Commitments is the story of so many bands. The best they can do is make others happy when they perform, but their personal lives are in ruins and the performers can barely keep it together when the show is over.The music from the Commitments is one of the great all-time movie albums. The covers they perform of great soul sounds are better than, or at least as good as, the originals. I bought the tape, then later, the CD, which I wore out and replaced. It never seems to get old.After all this time, only a few of the players did another film. This was it for most of them, and it was enough. One great film that never gets old. The finest soundtrack ever made, and music that never dies.",10,3,5,5 September 2009
District 9," Original, Riveting and Thought-Provoking
","The documentary feel gave the film an element of reality along with moments of seemingly unscripted (but really scripted) mistakes in filming. Aliens living in a South African ghetto called District 9 are not pretty. They look like bugs we might spray or swat. But they are taller than humans. Their appearance makes it easy for the government officials to mistreat them. We learn how they are treated in the early part of the movie as the aliens are being evicted from a squalid Johannesburg slum and being relocated to another concentration camp.Themes of prejudice, marginalization and ethnocentrism dominate most of the film, but we must change how we feel about these creatures to feel empathy.The human protagonist is a petty official who is collecting acknowledgments from the aliens on notices of eviction, apparently some legal requirement. Most of the aliens do not read. The human is vain, preens for the camera, and explains the process of eviction. While serving papers to the aliens with his security force behind him, he comes in contact with a substance which causes his metamorphosis. His transformation is a Kafka nightmare.Corporate greed is to blame for much of the inhumanity, and as our proxy becomes more like the aliens, he becomes the recipient of the same inhospitable treatment he visited on our visitors.This is not a perfect film, but it is exciting, thought-provoking and fun.See it.",9,3,6,22 August 2009
Gone Girl," On the Edge of My Seat
","Gone Girl was riveting, unpredictable and dark. Ben Affleck is married to a woman who is beautiful, rich and willing to please him in every way until she disappears. Gone Girl is about the search for the missing wife. At first this story line appears to be similar to the Laci Peterson murder case. Affleck is portrayed as self- centered, philandering and uncaring. We suspect that he might have murdered his wife. Amy Adams plays the detective who gathers evidence of a possible murder while the media world makes the missing wife a cause celebre. A Nancy Grace look-alike convicts the husband in the media while a pack of wild journalists hound everyone connected to the case.Suspenseful story and excellent acting make this a must-see.",9,0,4,20 December 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Not Really the Ogden Nash Walter Mitty
","'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is problematical. The cinematography is extraordinary. The movie is a travelogue taking the viewer to remote and scenic places. Mitty departs from the short story written by Ogden Nash in almost every way possible. The original Mitty was married to a carping spouse who had no patience for his day dreaming. Ben Stiller's Mitty is a single man who works at Life Magazine where he is charge of the inventory of film negatives. Stiller's Mitty, like the original, drifts into elaborate fantasies. He is, in real life, a quiet, invisible corporate drone who does his job and lives a quiet life. The pacing and tone of this movie is inconsistent, which is usually the fault of the editor. At times, it feels like a drama; sometimes, it is comedic. One would expect this story to be a poignant comedy, like the short story. Instead, the film tries to make Witty into an action hero. The script is illogical in important ways that detract from the story. Witty's quest, for most of the film, is to find a lost negative. He travels to Greenland, Iceland and climbs into the Himalayas to find the man who shot the photograph he lost. When he finally locates the object of his quest, he chooses not to look at it. Who, in the human race, does that? Another plot problem occurs when he travels to Iceland where he is present for the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, an eruption which disrupted air traffic around the world and caused temperatures to drop around the globe. Witty goes to the edge of the volcano, but gets a ride away from the eruption. A few hours later, he is at a Papa John's Pizza some miles away from the volcano. He calls his girl, but he says relatively little about the eruption. There is no volcanic dust, and no one seems to be troubled by the thing that just happened. The principal parts were consistently underacted, creating a flat emotional tone running through the movie. The flat tone stood in contrast to death-defying events. Kristen Wig and Stiller appeared to be mirror images of each other's emotional tone - both extremely under acting. There were some very funny scenes. The bit with eHarmony paid off nicely, and Patton Oswald added laughs. The ending was predictable as the conflicts resolved quickly into a romance that had been foreshadowed from the first minutes of the film.I didn't hate it. The music and the photography worked. There were flashes of brilliance and humor in the script, but the story did not hold together at important moments. There should have been some difference between Wig and Stiller's character styles. It was a mistake to have them mirror each other.",6,0,1,24 January 2014
The Dark Knight," Darker and Longer
","The second of the 'Batman' movies starring Christian Bale. Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney have worn the bat suit before Bale, and Bale is much better in the role.In both of Bales' films, the story line is darker and more complex than prior Batman films. The crime fighter faces villains who are more powerful than law enforcement, who are both out-gunned and hamstrung by concerns about civil liberties.The Joker portrayed by the now-deceased Heath Ledger is at once funny and frightening. Ruthless and quick to kill, he creates chaos for the joy of disrupting society. There has been some deserved Oscar buzz about his work.The film is about 2 and a half hours, and seems to run past a natural ending at about the 2 hour mark. The film is interesting and engrossing but it runs along the edge of too much and too long. Fans of the series will not be bothered by the length, but the action sequences are intense, layered and frequent. Most action films of this type find the climax earlier.The action is complicated at times, and there is so much of it along with elaborate special effects, it is disorienting as the characters migrate from good to evil and maybe back again.Less might have been more.",7,1,5,1 August 2008
Love & Mercy," Could be Called the Brian Wilson Journey into Madness
","Love & Mercy is the story of the making of the Beach Boys, but mostly it is the story of Brian Wilson's growth as an artist as well as his struggles with mental illness. Widely believed to be a composing genius by critics and his musical contemporaries, Wilson was the driving force behind the creation of the Beach Boys. The band created a unique sound that projected a characteristic Southern California style of living which included sandy beaches, surfing, girls in bikinis and fast cars. The innocence of the lyrics and the wholesome appearance of the bank masked the dark side of rock and roll of that era. Upbeat songs like 'Help Me, Rhonda,' 'Fun, Fun, Fun ('til her Daddy took the T-bird away), 'Surfer Girl' and many others created a vision of a happy beach life, but Wilson was an alcoholic and drug addict who could not get out of his bed for years at a stretch.The film focuses on a period of Brian's life when he was supervised by a psychologist named Eugene Landy, played by Paul Giamatti. This story was the subject of a '60-Minutes' segment long ago. Dr. Landy took complete control over Brian, moving Brian into his home while Landy took up residence in Brian's mansion. Landy would not allow Brian to contact his brothers, his children or his friends for long periods of time. Landy tried to control every bite of food, every pill and every minute of his time. Charging Brian $40,000 per month for 'therapy,' Landy had no other clients and lived with the musician 24 hours per day. The only outsider allowed to see Brian was Melinda, played by Elizabeth Banks. Melinda was a Cadillac salesperson who sold Brian a car but became his confidant, and, eventually, his wife. Melinda was able to save Brian from the clutches of Landy, who was eventually stripped of his license to practice and whose diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was overturned by more competent medical people.The film explores a period of explosive creativity during which he records his greatest musical achievement 'Pet Sounds,' an album which musicians universally admire. Brian was able to translate sounds in his head into musical scores without the band. Brian's ideas became more complex and difficult to play. He employed the hit-maker machinery of the time called, 'The Wrecking Crew,' a group of 20-30 session musicians who were anonymously on most of the hit records of the era.The film describes the tension between the working band on the road constantly and the composer who rarely left the house as well as the frustration of dealing with serious mental illness and acute substance abuse. Mike Love and the other band members wanted more of the old stuff, but Brian writing ever more complex music.Probably some nominations in the coming awards season for acting, script and score.",8,3,4,19 November 2015
Three Colors: Blue," A Perfect Film
","Blue is a masterpiece. It is first, and the best, of three films by Polish Director Krzysztof Kieslowski. The three films exist in circles which connect on the periphery. Characters from Blue, White and Red (the three colors of the French flag) intersect with characters from the other films but the appearances are more like Hitchcock appearances in his own films. The appearances aren't substantive and add little the underlying stories, but they are fun to see.Blue is beautiful and sad. The viewer watches Juliet Binnoche process the tragic loss of her family. The loss is routine, mundane without a real villain to blame. We watch her process a profound loss which takes her outside her daily life.She and her husband were composers, and the soundtrack becomes a central part of the story. It is a wonderful soundtrack befitting its importance to the story.The cinematography is stunning, as is Ms. Binnoche's acting.This is a rare jewel. The other two movies in the trilogy are worth watching as well, but they aren't perfection. They should be seen in order. White is the second film, followed by Red.",10,0,0,15 February 2014
12 Years a Slave," Tied to the Whipping Post
","Steve McQueen's '12 Years a Slave' will sail into the awards season with the wind at its back. An excellent cast, a sensational script, first-rate directing and a soundtrack filled with gospel music portend a fine harvest of awards and statues.The story is based on the experiences of a free black man, Soloman Northup, married with children. Nearly 20 years before the Civil War, Soloman is seduced by promises of excellent money into leaving his home in Saratoga, NY, to journey to Washington DC. While slavery is a fact of American life at the time, and it is legal to own slaves in some States in 1841, Soloman's life is a universe away, until he wakes up in chains, is shipped to Louisiana and sold into slavery. The harsh treatment of slaves and the outrageous notion of human beings as property is the subject explored in this film. McQueen is uncompromising in his approach to the subject. The camera gets up close as the audience watches the blood and flesh torn from the backs of people tied to whipping posts. There are moment-by-moment reminders to the slaves that they have no rights. The many ways in which slavery dehumanizes people are considered: a mother is torn from her children as the family is sold to different owners; a husband will never see his family again; horrid working conditions; educated blacks must hide their literacy from the owners; any form of defiance is met with strokes from the lash; every human comfort, every expression of human decency is denied to the slave for a lifetime; every form of cruelty directed at the slave is acceptable because they are property not fellow humans. I don't recall seeing such a graphic depiction of slavery in any other film.The movie is not a pleasant ride. It will make people uncomfortable to see the cruelty, and, for some, there will be shame. McQueen must have intended to create such violence and unrelenting malice so that we can feel the shame of slavery, a mutual shame. The slave is shamed by a profound sense of powerlessness, and the master class feels shame because an inferior and weak god is heartless and dark.",9,2,5,3 January 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Tom Cruise Stars in a Video Game
","It's June, and, on schedule, here come the movies that will keep young people entertained. The Edge of Tomorrow is part of the first wave of films targeted at the young people. A non-stop special effects extravaganza, Tom Cruise is Major Cage, a reluctant hero who must fight the same battle over and over. The script resembles 'Groundhog Day' where Bill Murray lives the same day over and over. Characters in The Edge of Tomorrow return to the same moment on the day before a major battle. Weird that I saw the movie on D-Day, and the footage of the Normandy invasion resembles the footage of the big battle.Unlike Groundhog Day which is about a man improving himself to the point where he is ready for a relationship with Andie MacDowell, The Edge of Tomorrow is about saving the world from alien invaders. Major Edge returns to the same moment in time after being killed on the field of battle. Each time he is killed he learns something new about the impossible odds which confront the human race. When in battle, he and the rest of the forces on the field must kill alien spidery things covered in tentacles. They are somewhat hard to kill, and they are under the command of a big giant brain. Virtually infinite number of spidery things and unlimited numbers of new lives available to Major Edge give the film a video game quality. Fighters shoot and kill the spidery things. As they become more able to predict the behavior of the spidery things, the fighters move to different environments. The top level of the game is the final battle with the giant alien brain.",7,1,3,7 June 2014
Whiplash," Music Bootcamp
","J. K. Simmons grabs this film by the throat and tosses us around like rag dolls. Abusive, profane, maniacal and pushing the edges of sanity, his portrayal of a college music professor who motivates his students towards excellence using despicable, offensive language is the best thing he has ever done. Simmons playing Professor Fletcher meets Andrew played by Miles Teller in a practice room at the university. Andrew wants to be a great jazz drummer, and he is willing to pay the price to attain greatness. He is single-minded and ambitious. The professor motivates his most talented players using extreme abuse. He is a bully.Most of the film is a series of confrontations between the professor and his students. He destroys the young, and he goes too far. Professors Fletcher is on a quest of his own. He wants to find a young Charlie Parker or someone with that kind of potential and push him to stardom. Fletcher admits that, in all his years of destroying impressionable neophytes, he has never found a real star, but he is not remorseful about his outrageous conduct.He is more cruel to the truly talented because he has no time for the students who have no promise. All along the way, we know that Fletcher's harsh bullying has a purpose. We know he is trying to whip his students into better musicians, but he goes too far.This film is a study in character - the character of the teacher and the character of the student. Some of the best acting, screen writing and editing in 2014. There will be nominations for acting and writing, deservedly so.",9,1,3,22 December 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Nothing Exceeds like Excess
","'The Wolf of Wall Street' is the story of a despicable piece of human slime called Jordan Belfort, a lying, cheating, alcoholic, drug-addicted, whore monger who happens to know how to con people out of their money. When his lips are moving, he is lying. His partners are less charming criminals Jordan handpicks because of their character flaws and lack of moral accountability. The film devotes most of its time to the day-to-day chore of finding and using narcotics, wooing and banging prostitutes and how to dispose of vast amounts of stolen money in the most idiotic, wasteful ways possible. Where 'Wall Street' was somewhat plausible because insider trading is, in fact, a way to grab obscene amounts of unearned money, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is not a film which will satisfy the MBAs or the street-savvy viewers. Scorsese's film is self-indulgent on many levels. It is long, running about 3 hours. It is vapid, dealing only with style without substance. When the film gets a little slow, Scorsese throws in another orgy. Men banging whores. Men banging men. Men banging on airlines. Men getting blow jobs on elevators, in cars at their desks. Public sex, sex at work, sex in the toilet at work. This movie has an army of whores servicing a large number con men. DeCaprio's Belfort is always humping someone. The drugged, drunken orgy continues for a long time. Jonah Hill, playing Donny Azoff, Belfort's business partner, dons some fake teeth and becomes the most annoying sidekick ever. He is every bit as drunk and sexually perverted as Belfort, but he is profoundly stupid. He is stultifying and sucks the oxygen out of every room he enters. As the film moves forward, you dread the sight of him.With 'Mean Streets' and 'Good Fellas,' Scorsese provides a glimpse of the world of Italian gangsters. The films ring true. The stories feel authentic. Maybe Scorsese doesn't know enough about Wall Street to create a sense of authenticity. Wolf of Wall Street is disjointed; it changes tone, and it never finds its true voice. The lead characters are nauseating, and there is hope that Kyle Chandler's FBI agent will bring balance to this film providing a dose of reality with gumshoe detective work, but that part of the story never fully develops. The story would have improved if we saw studies in contrast, like the 'French Connection,' where the cops are poor and dedicated as they observe the massive benefits of the lawless life.In the end, the orgy peters out. There are some unhappy vile people who get much more than they earned and much less justice than they deserved. Scorsese may be saying that this is how the world works. The cops take a pathetic plea agreement, and the con men blow up the world without paying much of a price for it. But Scorsese was seduced also. He could not take his eye off the whores, the drugs, the cars, the mansions and the glitz long enough to tell a story about money and Wall Street.",4,12,22,26 December 2013
It Chapter Two," Why Was It Made?

The Big Short," One of the Best Movies of 2015
","'The Big Short' is the screen adaptation of a book by the same name written by Michael Lewis, one of my favorite writers. Lewis also wrote 'The Blindside,' an award-winning film and several other books on the financial markets.Lewis focuses on the few oddballs who could foresee the financial meltdown, partly because of their personality quirks. The film brings real- life characters to the screen. These are the few people who knew for a certainty that Wall Street was laying the foundation for a massive meltdown in the financial markets.The screenwriters did something which seems impossible: they made this material very funny. Nearly every working American was touched by the meltdown. Their pensions, IRAs and 401(k)s suffered horrible losses, and the real estate sector of the American economy was crushed. We watch these brilliant misfits sleuth their way to an understanding of the complex, multi-layered fraud that was the sub- prime mortgage world.The failure of institutions to protect investors is a background story. In the foreground are truly interesting characters who were like the Paul Revere's of the avoidable crisis., but no one would listen. Fraud paid much too well, and there were no grown-ups in charge of our banks, government agencies, rating agencies or real estate firms.This film is fun.",9,7,11,31 December 2015
The Croods," Delightful, Funny and Gorgeous
","The characters in The Croods, an animated story of prehistoric humans is a wonderful surprise. The animation is stunning. The human drama is wonderfully comic. The dialog feels true as it covers familiar themes. The voices are performed by A-list actors who do much to make this film a delight. The story line has some unexpected twists, enough to keep you guessing, but the characters keep the movie interesting.There is an educational aspect to this animated story as is appears to depict life on Earth in prehistory. Some quasi-scientific ideas are illustrated - for example, the idea of adapting to hostile environmental conditions is shown. The main reason to see this movie is its good humor. There are many laugh-out-loud moments as well as heart-warming parts.Excellent script, terrific acting, beautiful animation, good story. A film that will entertain all ages.See it.",9,0,0,19 January 2014
Saving Mr. Banks," Interesting but Not Magical
","With the Oscar-studded cast, Saving Mr. Banks hits the screen with high expectations. Emma Thompson plays author P. L. Travers who negotiates throughout the film with Walt Disney, played by Tom Hanks, for the rights to a Mary Poppins adaptation. Disney has made a promise to his daughters to bring Travers' book to the screen, and he has been hectoring her for 20 years. Travers' fortunes are waning as the story begins, and faced with the prospect for losing her home in England, she has reluctantly agreed to go to Hollywood to monitor efforts to bring her book to the screen. She does not respect or trust Hollywood or Walt Disney, and she has managed to retain the final say on every detail of the story. Therein lies the conflict in this story. The Disney team of writers and music composers must dance to her every whim. She makes impossible demands of them, and she dismisses ideas for seemingly irrational, but deeply personal, reasons.Throughout the creative process in Hollywood, she experiences flashbacks to her youth in Australia. Her childhood was not ideal, but she has created a fantasy of her past in her writing. She fears that her fantastical view of her life will not translate well to the screen. In the process of rejecting the ideas of the creative team, she drives everyone crazy. Emma Thompson is one of the world's finest actresses, but this story puts her in the position of being a one trick pony. She has but one look for the camera for most of the film - bemused skepticism. She wears out her collaborators, but she begins to wear out the audience as well. The theme of 'sticking it to Hollywood' wears a little thin. Furthermore, since the audience knows that Mary Poppins became a reality, there isn't a lot of suspense about how this story will end. Hanks does a good job as Disney, but, Disney must have been a more complex man than he is portrayed in this film. This story is about how the author reconciles her past with her written fantasies. There are many pleasant and entertaining scenes which make the film enjoyable enough, but this isn't a great movie.",7,3,7,2 January 2014
Unbroken," Unbroken
","The much-ballyhooed release of Jolie's American directorial debut is a competent film based on the life of a man who was an Olympic athlete in 1936. He was a troubled youth who was coached by his older brother to compete in long-distance running. He was a part of the American Olympic team which competed in Germany in 1936. Later, he was part of a bomber squadron in World War II when his plane was lost at sea. Near death, he was spared that death by being captured by the Japanese. He was a prisoner of war until the Japanese surrendered. These events are told well. The film is beautiful to see and interesting viewing.",7,6,24,17 December 2014
Cloud Atlas," Some Movies Are Challenging. This is one of them.
","Films like Vanilla Sky, Mulholland Drive and Cloud Atlas challenge the viewer. Cloud Atlas is not a single narrative. It is a very complex layering of six stories. Adding to its complexity, the principal actors play several roles. The stories do not appear to be connected at first, except that you are seeing some of the same actors. 'The movie is long, almost 3 hours, and for the first 90 minutes, you want to get your mind around where all these stories are going. You want to know how they are related. It isn't possible. Cloud Atlas is a challenging film because you must take it in without thinking too much. The stories are interwoven and are related tenuously, but you cannot put the connections together until after the mid-point. As we revisit these stories, the structure takes shape for us. Cloud Atlas is unlike any film I have ever seen. Kieslowski's trilogy 'Blue,' 'White' and 'Red' dealt with the interconnectedness of people by telling stories about people who lived in the present day, but in different communities. Their lives touched on the periphery. Cloud Atlas deals with a metaphysical connectedness of people through time. The universe exists today as the aftermath of a large explosion which took place 13.7 billion years ago. Everything around us flows from that event. Similarly, everything in Cloud Atlas is related through time because of the repercussions of events in our past. There is a strong theme of reincarnation running through the stories.This is a brilliant film and an epic achievement, but it requires the audience to work a little. This should have been one of the 10 best for 2012.",9,4,5,3 February 2013
Easy A," She Makes You Forget Lindsey Lohan
","When I rented this movie, I had seen Emma Stone on Letterman and had heard her name bouncing around, but had never seen her in anything.She is Lindsey Lohan's worst nightmare. In Easy A, Ms. Stone plays the type of character, Ms. Lohan played in Mean Girls. The territory is the hostile world of high school. High school is a distant memory for me, and much has changed since I finished. There have been too many movies about high school for my taste, but each generation gets to mark their moment. Ms. Stone, in certain frames, bears a striking resemblance to Ms. Lohan. She is a younger, talented, less-troubled actress who can really carry the big screen.In her appearance on Letterman, they ran a trailer of the movie which charmed me. Ms. Stone's character receives a birthday card which, when opened, plays 'Pocketful of Sunshine.' She slaps it shut and mutters: 'Worst song ever!' Over the weekend, she opens the card again and again, singing and dancing to the tune. If that is her singing voice, Ms. Stone can sing. It is a very funny clip, but in that 60 seconds, she demonstrates a lot of range.The script in this film is absolutely one of the best comedy scripts ever! The relationship between her father (played so well by Stanley Tucci) and her mother (played so well by Patricia Clarkson, who is always good) and their children is warm, loving and very witty.This is a family which percolates wit and good humor. I would pay good money to have dinner and listen to them chatter about their day. Ms. Stone plays a high school student named Olive, who becomes the center of a storm of gossip about her alleged promiscuity. Her literature class happens to be reading Hawthorne's 'The Scarlet Letter.' Olive decides to play Hester Prynne. She changes her clothing and sews the letter 'A' on her bustier, flouncing around school as if she is exactly what they say she is.Wonderful depiction of how gossip travels through modern technology. Her every move is discussed in text and cell phone calls. Also excellent in this film is Thomas Hayden Church, who plays Mr. Griffith, her English teacher. His timing is perfect and his lines are perfect. This is usually not my genre, but Easy A is so much better than the average high school drama. It is a smart comedy with a lot of strong performances. It should make some Top 10 Lists for 2010. Comedy does not get as much respect as drama at awards time, but the cast, the writers, directors, editors and cameramen deserve recognition. This is a good movie.",9,2,4,11 January 2011
Joy," Don't Expect Silver Linings Playbook
","The star power of Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro, together again after wonderful chemistry in 'Silver Linings Playbook' is not enough to make this film a top-tier film for 2015. Ms. Lawrence plays an extremely co-dependent woman who cannot say 'No' to anyone. Her mother lives in her bed watching soaps 24-hours a day, her father moves in and out of the house when his lady friends throw him out, and her ex-husband lives in her basement where he practices his Latin songs. Her plans to become someone important have been postponed by all the care taking she must do for her many, ungrateful hangers-on.She is to become a giant star of cable home shopping networks. She invents a new kind of mop and goes deeply into debt to finance the fabrication of 50,000 of them to be sold on a cable shopping show. Everything goes wrong. Her supplier is crooked; her sister tries to undermine her commercial triumph, her father is a fool in business, and Joy reaches the edge of complete disaster.The story ends happily enough and Joy becomes some sort of home shopping channel legend, and thereby, she is able to continue to provide for her worthless family members.The cast of characters were not evil, but they were unlikeable. The arc of the story was too predictable. In the end, it was hard to root for Joy who makes millions selling crap on channels I avoid at all costs. It is not an awful film, but it does not approach the brilliance of the film which first brought these actors together.",8,10,25,20 December 2015
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Excellent Acting, Cinematography and Directing
","Ms. Jolie's work as an actress cuts across a wide range of genres. One can never be sure what to expect. From absolute excellence in 'Girl Interrupted' and 'Changeling' to competent and interesting in her action films, Ms. Jolie reaches occasional greatness. Other films pay well for her star quality. Her reputation was once tabloid junk food. As a young woman, she was known for being immature, outlandish and a little weird. Ms. Jolie has matured and become a humanitarian, and it seems that her mission in life to have some sort of impact on those less fortunate. Very few people are as fortunate as she is. She earns millions of dollars making movies, is admired for her looks by men and women alike, and she is married to one of Hollywood's icons.Her directorial debut with 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' is a film about the genocide by Serbian nationalists against Bosnian Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Western world was introduced to the war's atrocities when the nightly news from 1992 to 1995 aired footage of snipers killing civilian men, women and children in Sarajevo as they attempted to get food and water. The Serbs lobbed bombs from the hills surrounding the city, killing anyone who happened to be in the way. The world looked on as heavily armed Serbs murdered civilians and destroyed what had been one of the most beautiful cities in the world.Ms. Jolie's film imposes a Romeo and Juliet theme in the foreground while rape, murder and unspeakable acts occur in the background. A couple meets at a club. They are very much in love, and they dance away the evening, aware of only each other. This blissful moment is interrupted by an explosion which kills a number of the people at the club. We learn that the girl is Bosnian and Muslim, and her lover is Serbian, the son of a general who wants to wipe every Bosnian Muslim from the face of the Earth.We have seen some of these scenes in other movies. The theme of Serbian ethnic cleansing of Muslims has been explored before. The use of rape by the Serbs to terrorize and dehumanize women has also been the subject of other films. Once the women are on the bus, we know they are not headed anywhere nice. The men in the village are killed and put in a large ditch. These are relatively graphic scenes of violence. The women are taken to the troops for sexual entertainment. Anyone who challenges the authority of the Serbian military is shot immediately. The women serve the needs of the soldiers.We see Romeo at the Serbian military base where he is a captain in charge of a company of Serbs. They kill Muslims by day and drink by night. They rape the women when they feel like it.Our Romeo spares his Juliet by taking her out of the pool of women who will be used by the soldiers. She is a fine artist, and he finds a nice room for her, which is her cell. They drink wine and dine in the evening. He participates in horror during the day, but he relaxes with his captive in the evening. She is conflicted about her preferential treatment when her family and friends are enduring the tortures of the damned. She has no real choice in the matter.When his father, the general in charge of ethic cleansing, discovers that he is keeping a Muslim woman in his apartment. The father orders a solder to rape her and he berates his son for failing to hate all Muslims as he does.This is a tragic story about men who were willing to engage in acts of pure evil. How do rape and murder and vile acts of violence demonstrate a belief in Christianity or a belief that one's faith is superior to another? It has always been my understanding that the Catholic Church abhors rape and murder. There is no explanation. We see men who murder, rape, drink and tell jokes about their lives seemingly unburdened by guilt. There are a few Serbs who question their actions, but the pangs are temporary and they return to the killing and raping of their enemies.This is a film that will not please Serbian audiences as it shines a light on the war crimes committed against a people, a people they may still hate.Ms. Jolie's direction was excellent as the characters came alive under her guidance. Bravo.",9,91,276,22 January 2012
The Great Gatsby," To Baz or Not To Baz
","One of the greatest American novels and F. Scott Fitzgerald's finest work, The Great Gatsby is the quintessential story of the self-made American. The novel and the films. based on the novel, are voyeuristic - the lives of the rich as seen through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a commoner and a bond salesman renting a cottage next door to Jay Gatsby]s estate. The story takes place in the Summer of 1922. Everyone wants to know more about the mysterious Gatsby who throws legendary parties of fantastic opulence. Gatsby was played in 1974 by Robert Redford, a film which covered the same ground as this one. Because of the prestige and prominence of the original text, any treatment of Fitzgerald's work will generate controversy and invite comparison.While I greatly admire Robert Redford's body of work, his Gatsby was stiff and wooden. Leonardo Dicaprio's Gatsby does not disappoint. I didn't expect him to fill the bill, but he did.Much of the controversy about the current Gatsby is whether Baz Luhrman's treatment of the work was appropriate. People either like Baz or they do not. I really like Baz. His Moulin Rouge was a visual treat. The Elton John soundtrack was an odd choice, but it worked for me. His treatment of Gatsby's extravagant parties redefines the experience. Nothing in film history is more grand than Gatsby's parties. If you missed a party at Gatsby's house in 1922, you missed the party of the century. The color and luxury pop off the screen. Baz puts so much life into the script that this remake outshines the 1974 film as a visual statement. Gatsby is a love story about how a poor fellow tries to woo a rich girl. His exceptional efforts fail, but his efforts are spectacular. Expect multiple nominations and Oscars.",9,3,5,8 August 2013
