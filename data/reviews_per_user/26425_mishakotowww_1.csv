Blade Runner 2049," 3 hours of weak story, brilliantly shot
","there is something really wrong with the movie. and i do wanted it to be good.1. no tension at all. zero. nada. in the 1st runner you felt the mortality of the main hero all the time, hopelessly fighting with him against the higher beings. loving the impossible love. and how the chased replicants felt being hunted all the time. why would you feel strong empathy towards anyone in the runner 2049? no reason at all. no remarkable drama here.2. weak characters. in the original movie there were only dozen of heroes - the main hero, his gf-replicant, the supreme replicant creator, 2 of his workers, 3 cops, and 4 replicants. but each of them was bright character with some conflict (a replicant hunter that fell in love with one of his preys, the merciless replicant killer who saves a human life in the end, the almighty replicant creator who appeared to be just a weak childish old man, even the dirty cop showed some humanity, leaving the main heroine alive in the end). and in the latest movie its the same minimal number of characters but not enough of them are barely interesting - everybodys just a cliché, well, maybe, except the main hero, his gologram-gf and his boss in the police department. and because of their small number the weight on the shoulders of these cliché-flat-characters is just way too big. they just break.3. the movie has no genre the original was a clear noir-detective, set in the futuristic world of the sci-fi movie. the newest runner has no clear genre at all - its not detective, because it really lacks action and intrigue. its not sci-fi either. some pseudo-philosofical sci-fi drama pf pinoccio? without the good rules there is no game.",5,6,11,25 October 2017
