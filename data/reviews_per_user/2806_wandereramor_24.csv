The Avengers," Would it be too insulting to put comic book sound effects here?
","The MacGuffin has been stolen in a darkly-lit and confusing sequence, and now the military-industrial complex has to rally its choice second-tier intellectual properties to its defence. All of those guys from the past two years of Marvel movies, plus a chick, a black guy, and Hawkeye to meet quotas, must team up to defeat the evil plot of Loki, whose main superpower is getting his ass kicked in every scene, and a bunch of unseen aliens who want to take over Earth or maybe destroy it because, well, that's what aliens do. They squabble for a bit, and never really resolve the argument, but it's okay because a bit character dies, mentions in his last breath that his death will bring the team together, and then the team states several times that his death brought them together, in case you didn't get that. And then they fight robot space manatees.It's kind of hard to evaluate The Avengers as a film because, well, it doesn't really try to be a film. The plot is thin and generic, the characters were mostly established in previous films and don't gain any new development here, there's absolutely no attempt to create interesting images or anything more aesthetically pleasing than a forest of CGI, and it's not even internally consistent.Instead The Avengers is a series of cool moments strung together, and some of the moments are indeed pretty cool, although a lot of the one-liners fall flat. This is probably why it's been received so rapturously by the Internet crowd, which mainly judges media based off the number of clever animated gifs they can spawn. And it is frequently fun, mainly whenever Robert Downey Jr. and/or the Hulk is on screen. But the first hour is unbearable, and all the banter and big speeches in the world can't make up for the corporate hollowness at the centre of the movie. In the end, fanboyism is just another kind of consumerism.",5,5,13,22 June 2012
Requiem for a Dream," I need to get me a doctor like that
","Say what you will about Requiem for a Dream, but it goes right for the jugular with no pretensions or ironic detachment. There's a kind of emotional honesty and directness you don't often see in film. The smörgåsbord of crazy cuts, special effects, and other directorial techniques just help to make the film more of a bodily experience, an unending feeling of grimy degradation that ends up sticking with you long after the movie's over. Aronofsky would go on to learn some restraint and direct better movies after this, but there's something to say for the balls-to-the-walls visual insanity of Requiem.The story follows the parallel tracks of four drug users, all in a downward spiral. Ellen Burstyn, as a body-obsessed older woman who becomes addicted to mysterious pharmaceuticals has the most interesting storyline. It's a story we don't see too often, and it makes you pause and wonder how easy it would be to slip into this kind of life. The other characters are more familiar types, verging on stereotypes. Marlon Wayans probably gets the most superficial role, but Jared Leto and Jennifer Connolly as tortured lovers are never really convincing either. (Of course, the movie relying on Wayans and Leto as its leading men is probably its most egregious flaw).In the end, however, the film's power is enough to mostly muscle through the ordinariness of its story. There are times when Requiem for a Dream can seem like an after-school special about the evils of drugs, but if it is, it's the best after-school special ever.",7,0,1,9 May 2012
Casablanca," You probably already know half the script to this movie
","'Here's looking at you, kid.' 'I'm shocked, shocked, to find that gambling is going on in this establishment.' 'Of all the gin joints in the world, you had to walk into mine.' 'If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life. ' 'I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' 'Play it again, Sam.'Casablanca has taken such an elevated place in pop culture, its images and quotes (like the ones above) seeped into so many TV shows and movies to follow it, that when you actually get around to watching it it can seem a little underwhelming. Bogart and Bergman are Bogart and Bergman of course, and can charm the pants off anyone living or dead, but there's a lot of melodrama and a distinctly saggy middle. By the halfway point you might even be ready to write this off as one of those films that's important but not necessarily a great watch for a modern audience.And then comes in the third act, a powerful and blisteringly-paced series of climaxes, and all of your earlier skepticism was wiped away and you're rooting wholeheartedly for Rick and Ilsa and their doomed romance. Or at least I was. What sets Casablanca apart from so many of its contemporaries is its ambiguous morality -- not the universal cynicism of most noir movies but a mature perspective that can see good in evil as well as vice versa. Most importantly, it juxtaposes what we want as viewers and what's actually the right thing to do in a way few movies do.In short, even if you've received most of the plot and scenes through cultural osmosis, Casablanca is still worth watching, if only for that heart-wrenching climax.",9,2,3,26 April 2012
The Hunger Games," Well, it's no Battle Royale...
","There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.I could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you'll probably like this. It's a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it's not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn't meant to be.",6,44,58,23 May 2012
12 Angry Men," Insert verdict joke here
","12 Angry Men is at the same time a very conventional and a very innovative film. It's a classic social drama, one of those dour black-and-white movies where men in suits talk about Serious Issues, and that can be very off-putting to a modern audience. But at the same time there's a lot of interesting, subversive stuff going on below the surface.For starters, there's the format. 12 Angry Men is what's known in television as a 'bubble episode' -- it takes place almost entirely within one room, with the only action being dialogue between the characters. And this totally works. The movie never becomes dull, even for a member of my attention-span-deprived generation. Moreover, our isolation as viewers mirrors the jury's own isolation. The only facts we know are the ones we overhear, which puts us in the same position as these men. Of course, all this could fall apart without good acting, but the mostly (at least now) unknown cast pulls through and does an admirable job.What's most striking about the film is the uncertainty it leaves us in. Unlike in TV lawyer shows, there's never a smoking gun that says that the client is innocent or someone else did it. All that 12 Angry Men introduces is doubt: our eyes, our ears, the testimony of others, all can deceive us, so determining the truth becomes an impossible. The film reveals the absurdity of the American justice system, which puts so much stock in not just frail human perception but also the biases and pettiness of ordinary people. In the end the accused goes free not because he is innocent (that remains undetermined) but because Henry Fonda's character is very persuasive, and another guy wants to get out early to go to the ball game.Of course, you could also read this as an affirmation of the justice system. The jury is presented with a stack of convincing evidence, but through argument, is eventually able to come to the right conclusion. That's what makes this film so interesting: it's ambiguous to the point of paradox, being simultaneously a range of opposite things. I don't buy the idea that all great art is ambiguous like this, but in this case it's certainly true.",10,0,0,30 May 2012
The Exorcist," One of the best horror movies ever made
","What's remarkable about The Exorcist, especially when you compare it to other horror films, is its patience. It takes the time to calmly develop the ordinary home life of a modern postnuclear family, letting you get comfortable in the setting, and then things slowly get stranger and stranger, until eventually everything you knew has been upset or overturned.There's a fear of the future here, of a new deviancy that the older generation can neither understand or control, which very much positions The Exorcist in the social battles of its age, possibly even as a backlash against the youth revolt of the 1960s. But there's also a more universal fear here -- the fears of parenthood, and the unshakable notion that your child might turn out to be a monster and you would be responsible.More than this social commentary, what stands out is the excellence of execution -- the note-perfect direction, pacing, cinematography, and acting. None of this is very flashy, but it all has a kind of technical skill that makes The Exorcist a terrific movie, and one of those rare gems that can be admired for both ideas and craftsmanship. It's considered a classic for a reason, and should absolutely be included in the canons of not only the horror genre but the New Hollywood era of major studio art films.",10,10,14,7 April 2012
Goon," Alternate title: Future Brain Damage Cases of Canada
","The hero of Goon is a kid who's a bit dumb and a bit crass but has a good heart. He plays a pretty ignominious position, that of the goon -- the hockey player who isn't really too good at hockey but is really good at fighting with people. It's a vulgar role, but he takes it seriously. And that kind of describes the movie as well. It's dumb and a bit puerile, but warm-hearted, usually funny (including some laugh-out-loud lines), and charming in how accepting it is of dingy minutia like minor-league hockey.One could fault it for lack of ambition: the film comes and goes without leaving much of an impression, but that's also a part of its charm. Even at being a lazy Saturday night comedy it doesn't wholly succeed -- characters like the protagonist's gay brother and his mercurial love interest never really justify their screen time, mainly because of how spastically Goon jumps between plot threads. But it's a pleasant enough experience that would go down well with a couple of beers, and that's really all you can ask for.",7,1,1,25 May 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," The grand-daddy of all biopics
","If we're in the mood to do film genealogies, and I am, then Lawrence of Arabia is probably the inventor of the modern biopic, the perennial awards-bait genre. (You could maybe posit Citizen Kane as the originator, but that's really a different kettle of fish.) It examines a fairly recent historical figure at the prime of their life, dedicating numerous scenes and most of the dialogue to hammering home that the central character is a Very Special Person Unlike His Short-Sighted Bosses, and in this way the film spends a good amount of time justifying itself. This genre obviously has strengths and flaws, and they're apparent in Lawrence: the striking personal power as well as the kind of historical oversimplification and tourism that goes along with it.Lawrence of Arabia's main claims to being a great film are David Lean's gorgeous cinematography, stopping the action at several points simply to capture the desert in all its cold grandeur, and the film's final hour, in which Peter O'Toole turns his larger-than-life hero into a desperate, wild-eyed man who can no longer control the violence he's created. The biggest points against it are its indulgent four-hour running time and its unavoidable racism (having two of its major Arab characters played by white actors in brownface is really one of the lesser offences.) With this in mind, it's hard to say whether a contemporary viewer will really enjoy this film. I found it fitfully interesting but ultimately had trouble engaging with it, and felt kind of exhausted by the film. On the other hand, I've been told that it needs to be seen on a big screen for true appreciation, and not my modest laptop monitor, so I don't want to say anything definitive. Whether or not it 'holds up', Lawrence of Arabia is a pioneering movie that manages, despite everything, to capture a kind of beauty, and that makes it worth slogging through for anyone genuinely interested in film.",7,5,9,15 October 2011
City of God," One of the slickest movies you'll ever see
","A mixture of Tarantino-esque narrative play, a fast-paced plot, and the talented direction of Meirelles and Lund make this an intoxicating crime drama that's almost impossible to stop watching. It's a movie about cyclical violence and the degradation of poverty in Brazil, but for all that it's fun to watch -- the characters are catchy if not particularly deep, and the crime is aesthetically pleasing at the same time as it never lets us forget the horror and evil of the violence we're watching.I'm slightly less certain as to whether the film stays with me after that initial rush of sensation, but I think it's worth thinking about as much as it is watching. Admittedly, the characters are sketched very thinly (with the female characters being especially egregious), but the overall arc of the story -- the kind of innocent, fooling-around crime in the first part of the movie slowly giving way to more violent gang crime and eventually urban warfare -- is something that works as both social commentary and a powerful, personal narrative arc. City of God may not be the perfect film that many of its fans claim it to be, but it's that rare film that's enjoyable regardless of whether or not you have your brain on.",9,0,2,29 March 2012
Insidious," More like Inshi -- nah, it's not worth it
","Insidious is not a haunted house movie. This is something that the movie tagline and all of its ads trumpet, but it still treats it as a major revelation. So for the first 45 minutes or so we're forced through the umpteenth rehash of Amityville, with the same stock characters and cheap scares one would expect from James 'Saw' Wan. Well, that's not entirely fair -- it avoids Wan's penchant for blood and gore, but doubles down on loud noises and quick flashes of something that wouldn't look very scary in the light. I'm fine with a bit of misdirection, even an extended pretense at being a different type of movie -- hell, I loved Audition -- but when this lasts for half the film, and is as bad as this is, it has to be regarded as a failure.When we finally get to the actual cause of the spooky events things pick up a bit. It's still not exactly a good movie, but it's a fairly entertaining one, replete with long-held secrets and weird spirits. Insidious creates its own mythology, and it's expectedly unwieldy, but still more interesting than what it was before. It's still braindead, but for about half an hour it's thoroughly addictive popcorn fare.But the characters are too generic and the baddie too vague to ultimately sustain interest, and the de riguer twist ending is just tiresome. What gets me is that it's not as though the extended misdirection is even necessary for, or builds suspense to, the entertaining half-hour that is the peak of Insidious. Maybe Wan wouldn't have been able to extend that second act to feature length, but at least he could try. As it is, Insidious doesn't fulfill its ambitions and spends most of its time shooting itself in the foot. The fact that this has been described by some as the best horror of the year doesn't speak well for the genre.",5,1,1,13 October 2012
The Hurt Locker," This was fine
","I'll say this for The Hurt Locker: it sure knows how to make a bomb-defusing sequence work, an area where most movies get bogged down in 'red wire or blue wire?' nonsense. There's simultaneously an incredible tension and a puzzle-solving glee to these scenes that make them absolutely electric, and makes me think that this could have been a pretty good action movie -- hell, the maverick lead/straight-laced sidekick dynamic is lifted straight from Lethal Weapon. Unfortunately, when the actual shooting starts Bigelow's craftsmanship kind of gets consumed in a hail of loud noises and shakycam.But unfortunately this is a Serious Film, not an action movie, so we have to get a bunch of by-the-numbers character development scenes and theme-summarizing epigraphs. The main issue with this is that the film doesn't really have a lot of quote-unquote big ideas. There are only so many times you can watch Jeremy Renner go off and do something risky on his own while Anthony Mackie yells at him.There's also something here that isn't really a flaw in the individual film, but more in the emerging discourses and narratives of the Iraq war: it's exclusively a story about Americans going Over There, and the traumatic experiences that the soldiers suffer, with the experiences of Iraqis completely removed. In this film we have a manipulatively-used street vendor kid, but other than that the Iraqis are all just Others, mysterious and dangerous brown faces that just might have a detonator on them. Again, it's not that Bigelow had to address every facet or perspective of the war in her film, but I'm worried that, as with Vietnam, America will end up turning an atrocity done to another nation into its own personal turmoil.I don't want to make it sound like this is a bad film, because it's not -- in fact, it doesn't really have anything that can be identified as a flaw. But even while watching it I felt kind of detached, and it failed to make any kind of impression on me afterwards. Maybe this just speaks to my intrinsic difficulty empathizing with good-looking soldiers, but despite its technical excellence, The Hurt Locker just doesn't leave the impact that great cinema does.",7,0,1,22 February 2012
The Graduate," Postgraduate angst and anomie abound
","There are some movies that you watch at exactly the right time in your life. For me, there's no better time to come to The Graduate than right now, having recently emerged myself from the womb of the university and facing the daunting prospect of entering the adult world, a shift which seems abrupt no matter how much adult hand-holding one gets. The film perfectly captures the kind of aimlessness that comes with two decades of institutional guidance running out on you and the plaid horror of adulthood. Ben (whose character Dustin Hoffman expertly constructs out of polite deferment and aw-shucks candour) is used and imposed upon by the adults around him, and is caught up further in their net no matter how hard he tries to rebel.The whole thing is brilliantly shot, from the otherworldly underwater sequence to the last shot, lingering long enough to make us wonder about the inevitable consequences of youthful rebellion and pose the tragedy of the moment after the craziest moment of your life, the inescapable question of 'what now?'. Mike Nichols' camera can be coy and humorous at times, a rare treat, but almost always captures beauty. It's rare that you see a narratively-driven film like this with such distinctive direction, and it deserves praise for managing to capture the best of both worlds.The Graduate isn't a perfect movie by any means -- the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack begins to grate after a while, and Ben's love for Elaine never feels really justified -- but it manages to capture perfectly a complex emotion that always awaits on the other side of ambition, something that few works of art I've seen have even touched on. Recommended, especially to recent graduates -- hell, they should include it in the envelope with the diploma.",9,1,2,4 October 2011
This Is Spinal Tap," There's a fine line between stupid and clever
","The mockumentary is by this point a well-established genre, but today's faux-docs (often in the form of TV series like The Office) can often seem like ordinary scripted comedy where the characters occasionally talks to the camera. This is Spinal Tap, the film that really popularized the sub-genre, goes to great lengths to mimic and parody the documentary form: quick cuts, nonsensical asides, an awkward director occasionally stumbling on camera, no real narrative direction until the final act, and a lot of ugly people struggling to say something meaningful.Of course, the main thing that makes This is Spinal Tap a classic is that it's incredibly funny. The good-natured but dim musicians of the titular band are less a parody of rock stars than an absurd band of characters thrust into semi-fame. The band's fictional history, complete with flower-child flashbacks and a long line of dead drummers, is the richest vein of comedy. A few of the movie's gags have been overexposed through endless repetition (call it Monty Python syndrome), but there's a lot of clever comedy that still resonates. Reiner and screenwriter Christopher Guest are capable of both broad, goofy comedy and understated bits that only the attentive will catch.There are probably some points on which you could critique This is Spinal Tap -- the characters are hard to distinguish until about halfway through, and there is the above-mentioned lack of narrative -- but the whole picture is so shaggily charming that it's hard not to smile and laugh along. If you haven't seen this, it may be the best use of 80 minutes of your time around.",9,0,3,4 November 2014
Rocky," Surprisingly great
","In light of the massive media/cultural presence Rocky became, it's remarkable to go back and watch the original movie, and see how little of it actually got captured in the media zeitgeist and the sports genre formula it inspired. Yeah, there are all the scenes you've seen parodied before -- the training montage with raw eggs and the Philadelphia steps, the big fight at the end, etc. -- but nobody remembers that the bulk of this film is a fairly low-key, working class drama. I mean, most of the first hour is just Rocky hanging around the slums and harassing some pet shop girl. It's a lot more subtle and -- dare I say it? -- intellectual than it gets credit for, and it's also the kind of slow build that you could never get away with in a Hollywood movie today.Of course the more cinematic and bombastic scenes are great as well, and the film earns what could be cheesy moments through the earlier character work. The final fight is sort of ridiculous, but the final minute is cinematic perfection, one of those slightly off-kilter endings that you see so often in this era. We have the big celebration, the Hollywood kiss in the ring, as in the background -- quiet enough that you might not notice it the first time around -- Rocky is announced as the loser by decision. It's a moment that not only has a shocking amount of faith in the audience, but also makes them question their priorities. It's a bombastic Hollywood ending, but not the one we expected.And that's really what's lead to the success of Rocky. It manages to be a crowd pleaser without losing its integrity as a story, and in doing so forms the perfect bridge between Hollywood blockbuster and New Hollywood art film. If you've never seen this film and don't think you'd like it... you're probably wrong. I was.",9,0,0,20 February 2012
Psycho," Man, this is the weirdest adaptation of A Rose For Emily I've ever seen
","A woman with a secret meets a man working at an out-of-the-way motel. He is neurotic but charming, and the two of them decide to eat dinner together. She learns about his problems getting out from under his domineering mother, and encourages him to stand up for himself. And then he stabs her to death.Psycho works so well not because it is gory or innately terrifying but because it uses the familiar tropes of romantic comedy to set up a string of horrific murders. It suggests that the ordinary people we like or even feel sorry for are just as dangerous as the ones we instinctively fear. Norman Bates' twisted psyche ties together love, violence, and the Oedipal complex -- Hitchcock's favourite themes, perhaps never realized so well.I've always been something of a Hitchcock skeptic, and Psycho contains its share of the overcomplication and affectedness that often dogs his work. There's a lot of glut here -- the whole plot line of Marian stealing the money, the tedious investigation sequence after the first murder, and the clumsy exposition that puts everything in a neat little box at the end. If Psycho is great, it's not because of Hitchcock but because of Anthony Perkins, who makes Norman Bates somehow pitiable and terrifying at the same time. The scenes he shares with Janet Leigh are captivating, and more than make up for the less memorable material surrounding them.Psycho may not live up to its reputation, but it's still well worth a look. You won't get a more pure exhibition of Hitchcock's obsessions than this, and you're not likely to see a better performance anytime soon.",8,0,2,31 August 2014
Rango," You WILL believe that Johnny Depp is a lizard, in case you didn't already.
","Rango isn't a Pixar movie, but it feels like it may as well be -- state-of-the-art animation, playful creativity, overheated critical praise up to and including having an Oscar for Animated Feature in its best pocket more or less since release, a remarkable first act, and a surprising reliance on the usual plot outlines and conventions of children's movies.Rango uses the formula of the oddball pretending to be a hero, and if you've seen one of these movies (Dumbo is perhaps the most archetypical) you'll be able to see every beat coming from a mile away. But the journey is enjoyable and has some pretty amazing setpieces, which I won't spoil here. It also has a decidedly cynical sense of humour which is only eventually muted in the formulaic climax.The computer animation is top-notch, rendering a nigh-photorealistic desert and some gorgeous water effects. The distinctly odd character designs show more personality and are less realistic, which was probably a good decision. As the requisite big name star without voice acting experience, Johnny Depp gives a hyperactive and schticky performance that doesn't really suit the character. The rest of the cast acquits themselves much better, with Isla Fisher and Ned Beatty especially standing out.There's a tendency to grade these films on a curve: American critics expect little from animation and kid's movies, so when there's something of merit they overreact. The truth is, the bar has been raised for animation (and children's cinema, for that matter) a long time ago. Rango doesn't surpass that bar, but it more or less meets it. It's a formulaic diversion, but one with a lot of great moments and more than a bit of an edge to it.",7,0,0,2 September 2012
Prometheus," The best pro-choice movie this year
","Prometheus is a movie with big ambitions, aiming to super-size the Alien universe while at the same time making a grand statement about man's relationship with God. And it's worth giving it some credit for trying so hard to be a good film when just about every other blockbuster is content to coast on brand value and studied mediocrity. Which is what makes Prometheus's failures so heartbreaking.Things go along pretty well for the first hour. The visuals are, of course, great, a strange combination of the blue-collar sci-fi ugliness of Scott's most revered films and the cosmic grandeur of 2001. The plot goes along at a nice clip. The characters are broadly drawn, but not so much as to seem unreal, with Michael Fassbender's ambiguous android especially standing out. It's a set-up for, if not greatness, at least a solid film.And then comes the second hour, and things more or less go off the rails. The overall impression I got was that there were four different plots happening simultaneously, and none of them were willing to admit the others existed. In one scene Noomi Rapace's character emerges from a traumatic improvised abortion, dripping blood, and calmly plays her role as a minor exposition-seeker in another plot line. As far as I could tell one of the threatening aliens is forgotten about and never appears again. What's more, in the attempt to expand the mythos with a number of genetic mutations, Scott loses the mythic clarity of the first Alien film and ends up with a bunch of stuff happening.Still, it's a consistently entertaining film, and one that manages to raise some genuinely interesting questions -- would finding humanity's maker, as the visionaries behind the project, really give us a sense of meaning, or just lead us on a chase for a yet higher power? There are plenty of good aspects of Prometheus, so I'm not ready to junk it as quickly as most critics are. If nothing else, it deserves points for trying.",6,3,4,16 August 2012
Raging Bull," An athlete with domestic problems? Crazy
","Raging Bull is a very violent movie, but in a distinctly different way from the modern gorefests we usually associate with the term. There's an undercurrent of anger that runs through the whole thing, and which always threatens to burst out into open violence. As the back of the box tells you, it's this anger that leads to Jake LaMotta's professional success and private ruin. But that seems to give it too much of a purposeful direction -- the violence seems to move in all directions with no rhyme or reason. LaMotta wins and loses fights on the caprices of fate. He beats up his wife for no good reason, and goes about his business as if nothing happened.It's this directionlessness that I found kind of alienating. That may be an intentional choice, but after a while the procession of fights and events becomes a little numbing. Maybe this is why, though I respect Raging Bull, I'm not sure it belongs in the rarefied air of the Best of All Time lists that it usually occupies. Or maybe it's the occasional affectation too many, like the slow-motion opening boxing sequence.But on the whole Raging Bull is a remarkably well-crafted film. Scorcese puts together boxing matches beautifully, and does as good a job with physical interaction. DeNiro is, of course, the main attraction, and he's both riveting to watch and able to quietly capture all of the changes that LaMotta goes through over the course of the film. The supporting cast is pretty damn good too. It may not be the best of all time, but it's still very solid.",8,1,1,23 September 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The growliest movie you'll see all year
","The Dark Knight Rises is very much of a piece with its predecessor, The Dark Knight, with the same dark and gritty atmosphere, the same commitment to possibly unearned gravitas, and the same undeniable power. It does have a bit less of the good things about The Dark Knight and a bit more of the bad things, and is notably absent the two central performances of that film by Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart. Instead we have Anne Hathaway, who's surprisingly good as Catwoman, and Tom Hardy as second-tier villain Bane, who mostly sounds like a fop with a sore throat.It's easy to pick holes in a film with such earnest ambitions, but for the most part The Dark Knight works as a film, drawing you into its story and involving you in its harrowing nightmare world. It certainly deserves credit for having more in its head than the year's other superhero blockbuster, the vapid The Avengers. Nolan still can't direct action sequences, but beyond that the film's images are striking, and as the film approaches its end the narrative momentum ratchets up to an astonishing climax.It's only under further scrutiny that The Dark Knight Rises starts to look weaker. The plot doesn't really make sense, and the super-serious aesthetic it cultivates is in itself a little silly. A lot of people have rightly criticized the film for its political subtext, which adds onto the usual fascism of superhero stories by villainizing the Occupy Wall Street crowd. To me though, this part of the film actually feels half-hearted, as none of the political elements are developed in much detail -- just the occasional mention of overthrowing oppressors by Bain and a couple scenes of mock trial. There's no real sense of a society beyond heroes, villains and hostages. It feels as though the political plot is just there to add Importance and act as a buffer between stock training montage and action sequences.In the end, your reaction to the original Dark Knight -- and Batman Begins, which this film draws much more heavily on -- will probably be pretty similar to your reaction to The Dark Knight Rises. Myself, I enjoyed the movie despite myself, but I hope that it brings an end to the era of dark and gritty superheroes. When you can't even call Catwoman Catwoman, it shows not maturity but a kind of pretentious embarrassment with your source material. The question is how to move forward with superhero movies that are genuinely fun, embracing the camp aspect of comics, but are more than just braindead summer blockbusters. I hope that the next wave of superhero films answers that question, but I'm not counting on it.",7,1,5,3 December 2012
Casino Royale," Bond is, well, bond
","I'm not too familiar with the James Bond franchise, being one of those goddamn kids, so I probably went into this was the wrong expectations. All of the press for this movie is about how this is a darker, more mature and subdued version of Bond, all of which makes me really curious to see the other films to see what could make this dark and mature in comparison.Casino Royale is less of a fluid whole and more of a set of loosely connected action set pieces: we start with a chase scene in Africa, move to the Caribbean where Bond thwarts some poorly-defined terrorists, then it's on to a high-stakes poker game, and then a final bout of betrayal while everyone checks their watch and wonders how much time is left in the movie.And the action is pretty good, although completely over the top. The opening scene is especially inventive, and there's always a prevailing sense of tension -- even though we know, by virtue of the genre, that James Bond will survive and triumph, somehow the film makes us doubt it. The poker scenes will make anyone who knows the game spasm in their seat, but the tension is maintained effectively. Stylistically, it's very easy to respect Casino Royale.At the same time, it's really not anything more than those action sequences -- the characters are flat repetitions of the same archetypes we've been seeing for 40+ years, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Of course, one doesn't go to a Bond movie for character depth, so in the end I have to give this a conditional thumbs up. It's a well-executed, mostly enjoyable blockbuster action movie, but not as sophisticated as the critics like to make it out.",7,1,3,3 December 2011
Jackie Brown," Street life... street life...
","Jackie Brown is a crowning stylistic achievement that merges the 90s crime film with the low-budget exploitation films of the 70s. That sounds like it could be the kind of kitsch that Tarantino's next couple of films would fall into, but here it works beautifully, and seems like a perfectly natural style to make a film in. It's old school without ever being old-fashioned.The story is fairly complex, revolving around a money-exporting operation and the small fry that get caught up in it and then decide to go into business for themselves. Pam Grier is a likable heroine, and it's quite refreshing to see a middle-aged black woman in the starring role, but it's Robert Forster as her bail bondsman partner that really steals the show. He makes me want to watch a TV show about bailing people out of jail, which is something that never would have occurred to me before.In the end, there isn't a lot of significance to this story or the way it's told: it's just a very well-done crime film with a fantastic cast, a knowing but not excessive sense of humour, and some charming music. Everything fits together more or less perfectly, and though it's almost 150 minutes it doesn't drag. Not a life-changer, but it can make for a very good afternoon.",9,3,4,23 July 2012
Moon," Trying my best not to spoil this
","Give credit to Moon: instead of hoarding its dramatic twist for the final reel, as a more hackish filmmaker would do with this premise, it lets you know what's going on fairly early on and lets the implications of that percolate. If this makes the back half of the movie somewhat perfunctory, it does show its commitment to big, classical sci-fi ideas, which the 2001 nods are only a part of.Moon is based off of a series of fantastical conceits, but it's grounded in the world we live in more than many contemporary movies: it's a world of work, exploitation, and crises of identity. The drudgery of life may happen in space now, but it's drudgery nonetheless (here I'm reminded of Alien, another sci-fi classic). It also suggests that we need certain familiar fictions to keep that exploitation going: the loving family waiting at home, the supportive work environment, whatever drops of leisure we can get...Slickly produced, with a great claustrophobic aesthetic, Moon is a great think-piece film, especially for everyone who's been waiting years for a good science fiction movie.",8,2,8,30 January 2012
Her," Let's be honest: who isn't in love with their computer?
","From the trailer, I expected her to be a twee beta-male romance movie that would also act as a marker of our contemporary self-satisfied liberal consumerism. And it is all those things, but somehow it manages to be pretty good as well.Her is the story of a lonely guy, played by a hipster-mustachioed Joaquin Phoenix, who falls in love with his artificially-intelligent operating system. From the opening scene, set in a business that writes 'genuine hand-written letters' for other people, Her raises the question of how possible it is to form genuine human connections in a world full of artificial sentiment and consumable emotion? Rather than picturing the dystopia as a world of emotionless logic a la Orwell and Huxley, Spike Jonze imagines it as a world full of hollow feeling. In this setting, why not fall in love with your computer?Her is a movie that's all about contemporary technology, but manages to avoid either condemning or praising it. Technology in Her is something that can replace human relationships, but something that can also enhance them and lead to new modes of being. The ending suggests that the world we are heading towards may be impossible to even comprehend using our contemporary modes of thought, let alone judge. Maybe our emotional attachments, the overwhelming life narratives we form out of primal lusts and similarly base emotion, are just a primitive phase in human evolution. These are questions that the film raises, but never offers a real solution to.With that said, the genre of transformative romance is perhaps not the best metaphor for the coming technological singularity. This is one of those movies where women are defined entirely through their relationship with the male protagonist, and reflect little more than his own potential and development. As some critics have noted, it's a bit like 500 Days of Summer if Zooey Deschanal was an operating system. As such, the actual conversations and interactions between Theodore and Samantha are fairly dull.When Her film gets away from its romantic framework, it becomes a lot more interesting -- perhaps even great. It reminded me frequently of Synecdoche, New York, with its shifts between surreal humour and broad but powerful philosophical inquiry. Her is also visually beautiful, and Jonze has done a great job imagining a future in which the aesthetics of Apple and Google have taken over the world. It's the kind of science- fiction which feels neither ridiculous nor generic, and for that Her deserves attention despite its flaws.",8,0,2,12 July 2014
The Fighter," Coulda been a contender
","We shouldn't really be surprised by roughness in a boxing movie anymore, but in The Fighter David O. Russel presents us with an image of poverty and desperation that feels much more stark -- and, importantly, much more contemporary -- than the ghettoes of Raging Bull or the working-class district of Rocky. This feels like a working-class film too, unashamedly putting narrative before aesthetics and emotion before intellect.That narrative is nothing extraordinary -- it fits pretty comfortably into the standard sports movie archetype, in which the growth of character is directly parallelled by a growth in athletic success. There's a kind of simplistic and sentimental ring to the script, which seems too quick to cast moral judgement on its characters The performances are also not as good as you've heard. Melissa Leo is admittedly good, burying her usual hardness beneath an outsized overbearing mother, although there are times when she comes off as a cartoon. Amy Adams is forgettable, Christian Bale is gimmicky, and Mark Wahlberg is about what you would expect. The setting is the real star, no matter how many Oscar statuettes the humans involved can muster.Still, for all its flaws The Fighter has a good heart, and is at the very least the kind of solid drama you can respectably fritter away some time with. As a boxing quasi-fan, I would have liked Ward's fights with Gatti to be more than a footnote, but I understand that the focus of the film was on his struggles to reach that level. And it meets that goal fairly well, resulting in an entertaining if not particularly deep film.",6,1,3,10 January 2013
