The Double Life of Véronique," Has a Hypnotic effect!
","The Double Life of Véronique, a poetic masterpiece. This is a film which compels you to read about it more than the time you have watched it for. Krzysztof Kieślowski has made love to the silver screen. The magical use of Red, Green & Golden has taken cinematography to an altogether new level. The awe inspiring music by Zbigniew Preisner, that surely lifts the mood. And finally the most beautiful thing to ever happen to cinema, Irène Jacob. Though the film doesn't have a story that can be put on paper yet it has a hypnotic effect. Can't believe it was made 22 years ago. Those who love real cinema & want to celebrate emotions are in for a treat.",9,2,4,9 October 2013
