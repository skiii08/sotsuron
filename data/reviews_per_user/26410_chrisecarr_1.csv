Hereditary," This was a really really bad movie
","I am not a horror movie fan, but decided to give this a shot with my girlfriend who is an enthusiast. Not only did we both think it was bad, the entire audience did as well. The group in front of us were laughing and stating what a waste of time this was and several other groups joined in to agree. I don't get the good reviews, the movie was slow, boring, and very unrealistic.",1,12,29,10 June 2018
