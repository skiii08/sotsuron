Black Swan," Best movie of 2010!
","'The only person standing in your way is you.' The best movie of the year in my opinion. Plot: A Ballet dancer drifts deeper into insanity as her big day as The Swan Queen in Swan Lake apporoaches. Director Darren Aronofsky(Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, The Wrestler) gives a dark but unique atmoshere to this psychological thriller. Almost everything about this movie is perfect aside from one or two laughably bad moments. The movie has some pretty freaky moments and a few that may make you cringe but that just adds to the intensity But the best part about this movie is Natalie Portman. This is her best performance in my opinion. I'll be very surprised if she doesn't get nominated for an Oscar and I'll be angry if she doesn't win that Golden Globe she's been nominated for. She at least deserves that. She made her character so realistic. Mila Kunis is good to but she's nowhere near as good as Portman. Film makers, take note on this. This how to make a perfect film.",10,4,9,23 December 2010
Resident Evil: Afterlife," I came away disappointed
","Decent movie, but in my opinion the worst of the series. It didn't really serve a purpose. It didn't really do anything for the series and nothing is explained. It starts off great but as the movie progresses it becomes clear that this movie has no story whatsoever. Nothing important happens. I loved the action sequence...s, special effects, and the acting by Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. But Wentworth Miller and Shawn Roberts who plays Albert Wesker are just awful. Spencer Locke(Couger Town, Resident Evil 3) just doesn't have enough screen time to show her potential. It's nice to finally see Boris Kodjoe on the big screen instead of a straight to DVD movie like StarShip Troopers 3. He was the best actor in ST3. Out of all Paul W.S. Anderson's movies this is his worst. This movie had potential to be good but I know there are a lot of people out there who hate is movies, but I personally enjoyed Event Horizon and Aliens Vs Predator. All in all I was excited to see this and had high hopes for it but it left me disappointed. I don't want to spoil anything but there will be a sequel which I HOPE will be better and actually have a story.",4,21,44,12 September 2010
Iron Man 2," Almost better than the first
",Just as good as the first or maybe even a little better. What I love about the Iron Man movies is that they focus on story as much as they do action. They are perfectly balanced. An unlike other superhero movies it has a lot of humor. They got a new writer who should have written the first one. Jon Favreau is good director(not to mention a decent actor) and I wish he would direct more superhero movies. I enjoyed how it explored further into Tony Stark's alcohol addiction. Now what I love about Tony Stark is that he's not some brooding millionaire or whiny some teen who keeps trying to figure out if he should be a superhero or not. Can you guess who I'm talking about? Stark is the kind of guy who loves being a superhero and likes to have a good time. Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow are as amazing as they were in the first one. I loved Don Cheadle's performance even though I'm a little pi***d that Terrence Howard decided to not to return as Rhodes. It throws it off when you use a different actor as the same character. Mickey Rourke was the perfect choice for the movie's villain. Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell are great additions to the series.There's only one problem that involves a plot hole but that's only one small part. I can't wait for Iron Man 3 and The Avengers!,8,0,2,9 May 2010
Kick-Ass," A new kind of Superhero movie
","Awesome!! This is probably the first movie since Con Air where I didn't want to smack Nicholas Cage by the end of the movie. Be warned this is not a movie to take your children to!!!!!!! This is extremely violent and it's not something like Spider Man(though this movie did seem to borrow some plot elements from it.) I liked how it balanced comedy,drama,and action. It also has elements of a Coming of Age movie in it. I loved how Aaron Johnson's character matured over the course of the story. I really enjoyed Chloe Moretz's performance. She has the potential to become a good actress. Mark Strong plays a great villain.And Christopher Mintz-Plasse was OK as well.",8,2,11,2 May 2010
Avatar," Probably one of my favorite movies of all time
","Amazing. I don't know where to start. The CGI,action,romance, cinematography,directing,writing,everything is perfect. Everything is so detailed. James Cameron has created a masterpiece. The world of Pandora is so detailed and colorful, it almost feels as if it's real. The characters are likable even though it seems James Cameron spent more time developing the Na'vi characters than the human ones. The emotional part of the movie is like Cameron's previous movie, Titantic. It has the same romantic style. The Military or mercs remind me of Cameron's other movie, Aliens. The only problem I had with it was the acting was a little weak. But still this is a feast for the eyes and heart.Definitely in my top 5 favorite movies of the year and probably in my top 20 of all time. Movies will never be the same. I saw it twice in theaters(both in 3D and bought the DVD and Blu-Ray the day it came out. I was very surprised to find out it's actually better on an HD TV.",9,4,6,1 May 2010
Super 8," Best film of the summer by far.
","'I've seen it... nobody believes me...' 'I believe you.' If E.T., Cloverfield, and The Goonies had a baby, this would be it. Plot: In 1979, A group of young friends filming a zombie movie for the local film festival witness a horrific train crash near their small town. Afterwards strange things begin happening. People go missing, dogs run away only to be found in the next county, and electronic appliances are stolen. Things get more strange when the military shows up. The friends along with one of the friend's father, a sheriff's deputy begin to realize that that was no ordinary train crash. Director J.J Abrams once again shows that he is one of the best directors in Hollywood. Keep in mind that this the guy who actually got me to like Star Trek. This isn't just a monster movie but a coming-of-age movie as well. It has elements of a drama as well as elements of a classic sci-fi/ monster movie. The main character, Joe Lamb, lost his mother in an industrial accident four months before the events of the film and still hasn't let go. His father, a sheriff's deputy hasn't really let go either. Unlike most movie nowadays, I actually cared about the characters. Each is well developed. Heck, even the monster has more character depth than most of the characters in some of the movies released this year. As for the acting, I thought it was pretty good except for Ron Eldard, who while not bad, just isn't as good as the rest of the actors. I have got to say I was impressed with Elle Fanning. I loved her performance in Sofia Coppola's Somewhere and she does just as good if not better in this. I really do think she has the potential to outshine her older sister. While there are many references to Steven Spielberg's(who produced this movie) earlier films such as E.T. and Jaws, Super 8 is a movie that stands on it's own. I'll be very surprised if this doesn't get nominated for any Oscars. This is without a doubt the best film of the summer and I'll be first in line to by it on Blu-Ray the day it comes out. Until then I'd gladly pay another 10 bucks to go see it again which I have no doubt that I will. Total Score: 9.2/10",9,2,5,17 June 2011
A Clockwork Orange," Disturbing but still great.
","A masterpiece despite having some very disturbing parts. Stanley Kubrick(2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut) brings to life Anthony Burgess's dystopian novel in which a teenage boy named Alex and his gang go around terrrorizing(assault, rape) innocent people for fun. Alex is caught after an accidental murder and sent to prison and is put through a rehabilitation program which makes him sick whenever he has thoughts of violence and sex. There were times when I cringed and turned away. The rape scenes made me want to vomit, but most of the disturbing parts take place within the first hour. After that the rest of the movie isn't that bad. What surprised me about the movie is it's underlying tone of comedy. There are a few parts that are actually really funny. The acting is top notch especially Malcolm McDowell. His character, Alex has to be one of the scariest main character/villains of all time. After seeing what he does you kind of want to see him pay the price for his actions. While I was watching the movie Alex reminded me of Eric Cartman from South Park. Cartman was definitely modeled after Alex. All in all it's a fantastic movie but I would advise that you fast forward through the disturbing parts.",8,0,1,12 November 2010
Inception," Epic! Better than The Dark Knight in my opinion
","Epic if you can keep up with it! I had doubts about it because of all the hype. I can't tell you how many times I've gone to a movie that has been hyped up only to come away disappointed. But this really deserved all the hype it got. I really do think it's Nolan's best movie since Memento. I mean The Dark Knight was good(another movie that got too much hype in my opinion.) But to me this is 10 times better. I was most impressed with the story and writing. There's so much going on which in most cases is bad but not in this. Acting wise I would have to say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page gave the best performances, but the other cast is good as well. Until this I disliked Marion Cotillard mostly because she was in Public Enemies which I didn't care for in the least bit but she's great in this. But to me Inception may be the best movie of the year so far! I can't wait to see what Nolan will do next.",8,2,5,25 July 2010
