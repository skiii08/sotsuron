Scarface," great message, too much swearing
","I'm not a priest, but the f-word can get tiring after awhile.  If profuse swearing is an immediate turn-off for you, don't watch this one.I liked the message of this movie (once you get past the violence); a live by the sword, die by the sword story.  Al Pacino plays a Cuban 'political refugee' that comes to Miami.  He immediately becomes a hired thug and quickly climbs the Miami mob ladder to become a player in narcotics. Pacino's character's style - take big risks and the f*** with everybody else - leads to success and to his demise.The excesses of the characters made me sick to the stomach.  There are many messages in this movie, but they can easily be lost in the profuse use of violence and language.",7,1,2,2 October 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Can't understand what all the fuss is about
","I heard so much about this movie.  How great it was, a must see.  I think they left off the apostrophe-n-t.To me the film was basically brain-candy.  The plot had no meaning or message to convey to the audience.  If the characters sang it might have passed as a lame musical.",Null,0,1,25 September 2002
