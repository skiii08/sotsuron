The Legend of Bagger Vance," Damon and Redford make a great Team
","The Legend of Bagger Vance is what the movies of 2000 should have tried to be like. With the exception of a few movies (Requiem for a Dream , Cast Away,Wonder Boys) the year for cinema was pretty weak. This one is just great movie all the way. The story of a man who was great golfer who left the game and has become scarred emotional from a war he felt obligated to fight in has returned home to find out he is not the same person he used to be. Matt Damon gives another amazing performance. He plays  Rannulph Junuh the man trying to find himself again. 2 amazing surprises were the performances of Charlize Theron and Will Smith , 2 actors who have been in movies which have been money makers but which lacked critical praise. The way Redford uses golf as a metaphor for life is amazing. And as we watch Bagger not only try to help Junuh become the golfer he used to be , but trying to help find the person he used to be. It isn't until later on that we find out what Bagger truly is.One of the most under looked movies of the year. 8/10 Stars",Null,0,1,18 April 2001
