The Blair Witch Project," Great Idea for Movie but Implementation Needs Work
","I saw this movie and had to close my eyes through much of it, spoiling my viewing, because the shaking camera made me feel sick.  If the filmers had used a steadicam it could have made a huge difference in the quality of the output and made it more viewable.A problem I had with this movie plot (which has probably been mentioned by other viewers) is that few ordinary people in the circumstances as portrayed in this movie would have had the presence of mind to keep a grasp on a movie camera until their last moments -- if they really thought they were being hunted by the boogeyman.I think the idea is a good one, though, and I like how the website and the movie each provide something the other doesn't.",Null,0,2,15 August 1999
