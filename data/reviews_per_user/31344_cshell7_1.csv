Walk the Line," Absolutely fantastic film!
","I have just watched Walk the line and all the cast and crew have successfully turned me into not only the biggest fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but Johnny Cash. I have always enjoyed country music but this fascinating and brilliantly made film have given me a deeper respect for it, especially Cash's work. I only wish I was a little older so I could have enjoyed Johnny when he was in his prime. My admirations also go out to Reese Witherspoon who I thought played a fantastic part and the chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon was one of the best I have seen between leading actors for years. I infinitely recommend this film, If you weren't a Johnny Cash fan before you certainly will be after seeing it. Shell, UK",10,0,0,20 February 2006
