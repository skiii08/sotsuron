Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent special effects, weak story
","I commend George Lucas and Industrial Light & Magic on their superior special effects and sound. However, I was disappointed by the story. Too much time was put into the effects and not enough effort was put into the story. The story appeared secondary to the special effects. Hopefully in the next episode, Lucas will give equal consideration to the story as well as the special effects. Also I thought that the film was to geared toward children.",5,0,1,9 July 1999
