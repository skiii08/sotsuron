The Blair Witch Project," Classic horror
","The Blair Witch Project is one of the scariest movies that I've ever seen. Instead of trying to scare us with adding a musical score and countless jump scenes, it slowly builds and scares us with the possibility of what's out there. To me, that can be way scarier than actually seeing what's out there. For those of us that don't need gore in their horror movies, The Blair Witch Project is a real treat, and much better than most movies coming out today that pass as horror movies. For those that hate this movie simply because it's not real: Newsflash, most movies aren't real! I'm sorry that you got tricked, but that's a pathetic reason for hating a movie.",8,2,4,12 November 2007
United 93," Solid effort
","I was questioning whether or not I really wanted to watch this, and then my brother rented it so I went ahead and watched it. It turned out to be a very well made film and respectful to all those who lost loved ones on that fateful day 5 years ago. It could be tough watching for many people since it brings back so many painful memories, but I also think it's important to look back from time to time to remember the severity of the attacks and why we're at war. Also, the movie casts relative unknowns, which I think is a good idea, since it makes it feel more real with real people. All in all, it's a solid movie. If you were on the fence about watching this, go ahead and give it a go. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",7,0,1,11 September 2006
Superbad," Disappointing
","I think The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up are among the best comedies of recent years. So, obviously when I heard the guys who made those movies made Superbad, my expectations were very high. Well, Superbad started off promising with quite a few funny parts, but as the movie went on I laughed less and less. After awhile the laughs were so few that I was just hoping the movie would hurry up and end. So what went so wrong? I believe the key is Judd Apatow, who was involved in the writing and directing of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. In Superbad, he was only the producer. Next time I see a movie 'from the guys who brought you Knocked Up' I'm going to make sure Judd Apatow was involved in the writing and/or directing.",4,5,13,21 December 2007
Fargo," An amazing accomplishment
","This is one of those movies that just blows me away every time I watch it. Fargo is truly an amazing accomplishment. As per usual for the Coen brothers, the characters are unique, interesting, well fleshed out, and the dialogue is great. The acting is top notch as well, most notably by Buscemi and McDormand, although the rest of the cast is great as well. The thing that elevates this movie above most others I think, is how smoothly it alternates between the comic and the tragic. The dialogue is filled with great comic moments only to all of a sudden shift to a dark and gruesome scene and then right back to the comic. The Coen brothers are my favorite directors and this is my favorite from them. That should give you an idea of how much I love this film.I know a few people that don't like this movie simply because of the northern accents used in the movie. I don't know what to say to them, but it's a shame really, because I find the accents just add to the humor of the story.",10,0,0,11 September 2006
The Shining," Haunting
","Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is the best horror movie of all time. Yes, Shelley Duvall's acting sucks for the most part, but if you can get past that you'll find a great movie. Jack Nicholson gives one of his best performances as a slightly insane man who goes very insane. But the real star of this movie is Kubrick. He brilliantly paces and stylizes the film to create one of the most haunting movies you'll see. He did change some things from the book, but they are done for the betterment of the movie. I beg you book purists (I am one of them) to give this movie a chance and just roll with the changes made, because I strongly believe they were the right changes to have made for the film. The made for TV 'The Shining' may follow the book better (which I like the TV version as well), but it's not as good of a movie.",10,1,3,30 November 2007
Transformers," Michael Bay
","Michael Bay knows how to do action sequences. Unfortunately, his abilities end there. There were multiple problems with this movie. First, the transformers talking like they're hip was just stupid. Which brings me to my next point, it tried too hard to be funny, and therefore wasn't very funny at all. Also, what's the deal with focusing so much on the humans? Aren't the transformers supposed to be the stars of a movie called Transformers? Finally, the movie was just plain too long. This type of story should not require any more than 2 hours. Other than those problems this was a great movie!",4,3,7,16 November 2007
Big Fish," Excessively sentimental
","First, I've got to say Tim Burton movies are always visually great to look at, and this is no exception. Unfortunately, the visuals are about the only good thing going for this movie. It feels like it tries too hard to be sentimental and forgets to actually make a good story that's interesting. The stories where just plain boring and didn't seem to have any point other than just to flaunt his visual style and to appeal to the most sentimental of viewers. And this movie wears on you; the longer it goes on, the more it becomes unbearable to watch, which makes the 2 hour runtime seem like an eternity.I guess people that like their movies mawkish would like this one (which by looking at the IMDb rating it appears that there are a lot of people like that), but I'm not one of them. I expected more from Burton.",3,4,9,24 July 2006
The Descent," Alien meets Deliverance
","The Descent starts off well, introducing the characters and giving them some depth. Then it slowly builds the feeling of claustrophobia as the girls descend deeper and deeper into the caves, before finally releasing the gore and action.This is one of the scariest and most well made horror movies I've seen in awhile. It was suspenseful from the moment they enter the cave all the way to the end. While it is certainly gory, I don't think it's used to excess.I've heard people call this the scariest horror movie since Alien. I can't say that I disagree.",9,1,3,15 November 2007
The Deer Hunter," Worth a watch
","A group of working-class friends enlist in the Army to go to Vietnam. Their time in Vietnam turns out to be a nightmarish experience, and affects all of them in different ways. This isn't a war movie, per se, but more of an examination of how the war affected both the soldiers and their friends and family back home.I had high expectations with this movie being in the AFI top 100 movies and top 100 thrills, not to mention the multitude of awards it won in 1978. I admit that for the most part, this is a really good movie. However, I found it to be a little too drawn out at times. I'm glad I watched it, but once I think will be enough for me.",6,0,1,3 September 2006
