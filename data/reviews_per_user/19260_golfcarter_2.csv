Catch Me If You Can," Great story with wonderful acting
","Tom Hanks once again shows why he is the modern day Jimmy Stewart. There isn't a part he can't play, and he brings out the best in everyone around him. Unlike the Tom Cruise/Paul Newman hook-up in 'The Color of Money,' I think that this movie will be the vehicle that launches Leonardo DiCaprio into a wider range of roles.The delight of this show comes from its reality. The check fraud was a product of the times, when the world trusted most people to be honorable about bank checks. And the movie really captures your attention and allows you to empathize and imagine living the characters vicariously.I highly recommend this movie...You will not be disappointed.",9,0,0,27 December 2002
U-571," Excellent, fast paced 1940's style adventure
","I really enjoyed this film. It reminded me of the B&W films from the 40's. Guys in love, no women in sight. Everybody wearing oil soaked clothes and gritty expressions. The fictional story allowed Matthew McConaughey to play an old Robert Mitchum like character.I really loved Harvey Keitel's character. The salty Chief who displayed incredible leadership and loyalty to the service, his crew and his skipper. Here! Here!",Null,0,1,2 May 2000
