Deja Vu," Deju Vu - Great entertainment.
","I have just seen this great movie. I have to say that it was over my expectations. I thought it was yet another bad Hollywood shitty but it actually had the most that I want a good action/thriller movie to have. The movie is exciting trough the whole film and the story is weary different to other movies. If you want to see a good action with a lot of spectacular scenes, then this is it for you. Denzel plays the role with such an enthusiasm and quality. Even if the movie is kind of hard to portray because of the special story it has, they actually made it more then good in a way that you never get tired. It sort of draws you in to all the wild action scenes. All the bites in the puzzle thats lost in the beginning, will get in place at the end. A movie I strongly can recommend even if it has a kind of wired story.",8,0,0,28 April 2007
