Sucker Punch," Good movie but...
","First of all it had an amazing visual effects and a great soundtracks and it was directed by Zack Snyder witch is one of my favorite directors. I've watched this movie for two times and in my opinion it was an average movie it wasn't the thing that i expected.In my opinion it the best fantasy movie i've ever seen in my life.But it had an awful storyline it's very similar to the movie 'Inception'. beside that it's was so Complicated after the movies end the only thing i said was 'WHAT THE F@^k???'.But it not as bad as you think it had killer robots,dragoons,zombies,Orcs,sexy chicks,and lots of action but there are two questions:How could baby doll do those awesome moves without training? How could she enter the dream world? I think it can't beat Snyder's previous movies (300'Watchmen).",6,0,1,20 June 2011
