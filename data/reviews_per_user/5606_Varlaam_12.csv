Vertigo," Did Hitchcock allow his assistant to direct?
","I first saw this film in the mid-'80's and again recently. The words which come immediately to mind to describe it are 'tedious' and 'pointless', words one does not normally associate with Hitchcock. 'Overrated' does not even come close. Perhaps someone will produce a restored version of Vertigo , with an extra hour or two of San Francisco street scenes. Vertigo is already more like a travelogue than a narrative.",1,56,102,14 August 1998
Vertigo," Vertigo takes the crown
","Some of Hitchcock's silents are a little slow, and his genius began to decline in the '60's -- Topaz, Marnie, The Birds -- but none of these are serious challengers to Vertigo for the title of Worst Hitchcock Film. Maybe if Hitch had cast Grace Kelly, or Vera Miles, or Shirley Temple, or someone from a Bay Area high school production ...",1,33,77,15 August 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Silent film references
","Boy, what a dud, eh? And I had been told not to expect very much. The theatre here in Toronto was nearly empty. I guess the word has gone around already.But at least the occasional silent film references may encourage people to investigate some older films of greater merit.The scene of the blue globes rolling past that irritating Ja-Ja-Jamaican character is from the climax of Buster Keaton's 'Seven Chances' (1925). In Buster's case, the globes are boulders and the scene is actually funny. Very funny in fact.The city scene at the end of this film is clearly modelled after the Babylonian set in D.W. Griffith's 'Intolerance' (1916), while the look of the capital planet is taken from Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927). Most people, I think, would have noticed the latter. It's the outward visible sign -- 'In hoc signo vinces' -- that any references you think you're seeing are, in fact, 1) real, and 2) intentional.The pod race, of course, derives from Gen. Wallace's 'Ben Hur'. I choose to believe it's Fred Niblo's 1926 version with Ramon Novarro that's being referenced, superior I think to the Wyler / Heston remake. Most people who've seen both prefer the original, although the second one does have its strengths too.For a change of pace, there was that sound film reference -- the sound film has really been catching on, I hear -- that little group of E.T.'s that you see briefly in the Senate chamber. That was cute, a little unexpected. And two seconds worth of 'E.T.' is about all I can tolerate anyway, so it was just right. A pinch of cuteness, no more.I have been avoiding the hype about this movie as much as has been humanly possible. Perhaps some publicity has mentioned these homages, perhaps not. In any case, they are pretty clear to greying members of the audience.Not paying attention to the pre-publicity may have been a mistake however. The filmmaker assumes you've seen it so he doesn't have to give you any basic information. For example, what was the main character's name? Liam Neeson's? After the screening, I stopped into the bookshop next door where I learned the name of the lead character in the film I'd just seen! Thank goodness for neighbourhood bookstores.I should also state for the record the most obvious point about the movie, its argument in favour of the current Canadian parliamentary system. Where senators don't have any real actual power to use and abuse. Members of those of Her Majesty's opposition parties who are plotting Senate 'reform', please note: See this movie! See it now!And thank you, George, for your firm support for the constitutional status quo here in Canada! We appreciate it!",2,4,7,27 May 1999
Citizen Kane," Listen to a crotchety old guy when he's talking at you, whippersnappers
","Any (re)viewers who came away with negative impressions of Kane probably made the mistake of watching the film on video. You should never approach a classic film in anything but a proper movie theatre. Would you watch '2001' at home on a 14' screen? You would! Why? Watching 2001 on anything other than a full-size movie screen, or even better an IMAX screen, is a waste of time. Its grandeur cannot be appreciated under home conditions, pausing the film every 10 minutes to check on the laundry.Citizen Kane has a lot more plot than 2001, but the problem is the same. Everything that's daring and exciting about the direction -- the crazy camera angles, the freakish tracking shots, the wildly imaginative changes in mood and lighting -- you don't get anything of that on a tiny screen. All you get at home are the clever plot, brilliant dialogue, and great performances, but even so I find Kane boring at home too. Oh, and don't forget the subversive assault on the necessarily irresponsible use of corporate power. Off hand, I can't think of a single Welles film that works on a TV screen. Well, maybe Touch of Evil, since it's so heavily plotted. But with Ambersons, Lady From Shanghai, The Trial, Chimes At Midnight, to cite just a few quickly, you're just ruining it for yourself getting your first exposure at home.There's a second-run movie theatre somewhere near you that needs your support and probably shows nice, scratchy prints of Kane, exactly the kind that everyone who loves Kane saw their first time.I'm one of the people who thinks the AFI list is a bad joke which can safely be ignored. By accident, some great films did manage to wind up on the list. Citizen Kane is one of them.As our Neapolitan compatriot, who most graciously excluded his own country's Ladri di biciclette from consideration, says, Citizen Kane is 'il più grande film della storia del Cinema'. I think it's the greatest in cinematic history as well. Yeah, and it's boring at home.",10,10,15,18 October 1998
Fargo," Just as wretched as any other Coen Bros. epic
","Attempts at humour alternating with gratuitous, nauseating violence -- that pretty much defines the self-indulgent style of the Coen Brothers, the wannabe Leopold and Loeb of their generation. It's a wonder they're not more popular.",2,10,26,15 August 1998
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," S-O-O-O-O-O much better than the first one
","Even if the plot is just a rehash of King Kong.There is an obvious parallel with Alien(s): Vol. 1 is a thriller, Vol. 2 is an action picture. For Vol. 3, Jeff Goldblum will need a reason to shave his head and/or give birth. There is also a parallel with Wayne's World 1 and 2: the first one was stupid, the second less stupid.Jurassic Park was for kids. The Lost World is a light snack for adults with lots of funny dialogue. This film might be Dumb, but the first one was definitely Dumber. I don't recall a Hemingway joke in Jurassic Park. And The Lost World doesn't have dinosaurs who know how to open doors, or roll cigarettes with one hand (sorry, that last one's a bit of an embellishment).The Lost World does not have a repeat of that horrible, obnoxious, rude, unladylike Laura Dern character from the first one, thank goodness. The Julianne Moore character is the substitute here, although she is not without her problems. She is responsible for the sickeningly cute injured baby dino plot element which is the chief give-me-a-break issue this time around. If you try to carry a frightened animal, it will instinctively try to bite or scratch you. Unless it's a T. rex 'infant' apparently. Sort of the Barney of the Jurassic Era. Cuddly. Non-threatening to children.",6,0,2,11 December 1998
Life Is Beautiful," The Triumph of the Human Spirit
","That seems to be a favourite cliché applied to this fantasy film. The entire movie apparently is a child's dream about a concentration camp. Only in fairy stories would a death camp be so sparkling clean and spacious. The detainees in this (holiday) camp are free to move about as they please. They can even play with the Aryan Gretchens and Hansis if they want to.In the Czech Republic, there's an exhibit of drawings made by cute and precocious children vacationing at the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Their amusingly childish artwork shows typical scenes of camp life, large black monsters crushing tiny people wearing little yellow stars, for example.I happen to have seen another concentration camp film this week, Escape from Sobibor (1987). In that film, Jews also banter and jest with the Nazis, only they do it by applying axes to their heads and homemade knives to their stomachs. History would seem to have demonstrated that axes and knives are more effective tools for dealing with Nazis than making jokes at their expense.'Uplifting' is another label assigned to Life Is Beautiful. It might better be applied to Escape from Sobibor, a true story about real people -- not 'princes' and 'princesses' -- overcoming real odds at huge cost to escape from an actual murder camp.Nice Offenbach music can be found in this film though, one of my personal favourites in fact, Tales of Hoffmann. SS men in actual death camps didn't keep a lot of Jewish opera records on hand for the musical edification of the inmates.",4,7,18,18 November 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Crash course
","Hey, droogs, when you're trying to wrap your yahzick around bolshy great words like 'malenky' and 'malchick' without spilling too much red, red kroovy from a burst blood vessel, guess what, that's Russian you're speaking. Just when you were enjoying all that ultraviolence, real horrorshow, and the old in-out, you were really hitting the books. Subversive, isn't it?The current Penguin edition of Anthony Burgess's novel now makes it clear that your humble narrator's arresting way of speaking is actually Russian (right down to 'horrorshow'), but in olden times you had to figure that out for yourself, assuming that you ever did.'Clockwork' may well be a director's Meisterwerk, a stylistic pièce de résistance, but it is at least partially a succès de scandale. I still feel that Kubrick was irresponsible not to include the final chapter of Burgess's novel. Perhaps the film would not still be banned in the Mother Country if he had. It may well have required someone of Kubrick's ingenuity to handle the abrupt change in mood at that point -- assuming that he had shot the ending straight without putting his own ironic twist on it, which is doubtful. And of course this paragraph is predicated on a fairly literal reading of Burgess, but Burgess edited Joyce, so perhaps Burgess should never be taken at face value either.For all its brilliance, the film needs to be taken cum grano salis. Investigate the book, and draw your own conclusions. (You will even find the explanation for the film's title there.)Afterthought, since reviewing the other comments: When I first saw this film 20 years or so ago, it was unspeakably violent and physically repellent to watch. This was before the modern wave of crime and horror films. 'Bonnie and Clyde' and 'The Wild Bunch' may have opened the floodgates for cinematic violence, but 'A Clockwork Orange' was in an entire other class. It disturbs me that I can now watch this film without revulsion, and that's not due to overexposure to the film itself which I've only seen a couple of times, but rather to mass culture as a whole.",10,1,1,29 November 1998
All Quiet on the Western Front," Milestone worshipped at the altar of Eisenstein
","Lewis Milestone made a close study of Sergei Eisenstein's techniques, and we have a mimeograph of them here, the kind that came off the bottom of the pile where the machine had been running out of ink. This film was a revelation in its day, a real eye-opener. Cinema-goers in 1930 had trouble finding authentic Eisenstein; that's not a problem we have now. This version has genuine value as an historical artefact, but any person born since 1920 would probably be far happier seeing the Richard Thomas / Ernest Borgnine TV remake, which feels far closer to Remarque's Im Westen nichts Neues (Nothing New in the West).",5,5,13,17 August 1998
The Thin Red Line," Yin and Yang
","The central drama in this film pits Elias Koteas (Capt. Staros) as the feminine principle, who prefers to play nursemaid to his men rather than lead them, against Nick Nolte (Col. Tall), the stern father figure who will sacrifice a few to save the rest. Fortunately, Nolte takes charge before Koteas can get everyone killed.Other than that pairing off, there is no drama in this story and no character definition of any depth. Of course no one is interested when faceless fodder goes before the cannon. James Jones gave all his characters monosyllabic names to make them indistinguishable from one another, and they certainly are. The fact that soldiers die amid grass that is an unusually vivid shade of green hardly matters, does it? When you have never even made their acquaintance?The film is ostensibly about the Battle of Guadalcanal. Viewers will be forgiven if they come away with the notion that the battle consisted of a couple of minor skirmishes totalling about 50 guys. Guadalcanal, the Historical Footnote. Pearl Harbor: The Tiny Puff of Smoke.History is clearly not Malick's strong suit. Do the Japanese in this film bear *any* resemblance to the Japanese the US actually fought in the South Pacific? The Japanese surrender in droves! And then they're not tied up, or guarded by anyone. The cowed soldier of Imperial Japan, noted for his docility? Or was Guadalcanal secretly occupied by Japanese-American civilians ready for internment? Was that it? Is that An Untold Story of World War II?I suppose I've seen Terrence Malick's 'Days of Heaven' (1978) several times in the past couple of decades. I'm not terribly fond of it; it's long, and slow, and pretty, much like this one. Malick seems to think he's the reincarnation of Aleksandr Dovzhenko, or something.But 'Days of Heaven' did have characterization that was a little fuller, and some social observation as well. On both counts, 'The Thin Red Line' falls short. When an artillery round happens to fall short, it tends to land on its own lines. That should be the epitaph for the volunteers who enlisted in Terrence Malick's pet project: 'Killed by friendly fire'.",3,4,8,8 January 2000
Contact," 'Do you believe in fairies?'
","Or, do you believe in extraterrestrial intelligence, as the question should be in this case?'If you believe, clap your hands!'This film does for this century and the next what J.M. Barrie's play 'Peter Pan' did at the turn of the last one. It inspires the same degree of childlike enthusiasm and delight.'Contact' is a truly fitting tribute to the altruistic and humanistic ideals of the late astronomer, Carl Sagan.",8,0,8,13 November 1999
Jurassic Park," I feel hoodwinked
","Dramatic structure is supposed to be situation, crisis, conflict, resolution. Jurassic Park gets as far as crisis. This is set up like a three-act drama, but the third act is missing. At the point in the film where you are set for the 'good part' to start, the movie abruptly ends. I have never seen such cold-blooded, calculated manipulation. Frankly, I'm surprised that this piece of product generated line-ups, rather than boycotts.",5,3,14,17 August 1998
