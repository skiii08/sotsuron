Alien 3," Underrated!
","I honestly have no idea why people dislike this movie so much.  True, it's not the best in the series (in my opinion, the quality of the films run in chronological order), but in my opinion it's the best directed.  Dark, disturbing and full of symbolism.  David Fincher (also one of my favourite directors) did a great job with an impossible situation.  And believe me, 'Alien 3' was an absolute nightmare to put together.  Only days after the release of 'Aliens,' Twentieth Century Fox ordered for a third Alien film to go into production.  Six years, several directors and ten scripts later, they got 'Alien 3.'  Production was an absolute mess, with trailers being released while production was barely off the ground, and according to David Fincher, they were being faxed more pages of the script on set and were forced to shoot those scenes the same day.Anyhow, on a different note, it's interesting to note that 'Pitch Black' was originally slated to be the third Alien film, but the director, David N. Twohy, was fired from production.  However, he decided to go off and make the movie anyway.  There was a little tweaking in the script of course, but the basic outline is still there (spaceship crash lands on a planet full of very Alien-like aliens, the main character is a woman, there's a child involved, the woman dies at the end, etc.).",Null,1,3,29 September 2002
Dawn of the Dead," No Threat to Romero's Classic
","Being a huge fan of the original, I went to see this opening night with a bunch of friends. Naturally, I was going to be very critical, but was actually very pleasantly surprised. Sure, it sacrificed the satire and character development of the original for more action and more (realistic) gore, but that was nothing unexpected. All I was hoping for was a good zombie movie using a similar premise as theoriginal. And that's exactly what I got, and maybe even a little more too.A lot of people will probably say that this movie will turn newcomers off from seeing the original, but I disagree. After we left the theatre, all my friends wanted to see the original movie as soon as possible. One even went as far as to buy it. So I guess at its worst, this movie is just a big advertisement for George A. Romero's classic cult film.On another note, I actually don't live too far away from Thornhill Mall, where the movie was shot. I wonder if they have a movie theatre there...I think I'll go see it again.",Null,0,0,22 March 2004
Alien," Effective...
","When one brings up the subject on horror movies, your first thought is of the 'Scream,' 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and the 'Friday the 13th' series. But then you think a little harder, about the good ones--'The Exorcist,' 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'Poltergeist' and 'Alien.'I admit, I have yet to see 'The Exorcist,' but to this day, 'Alien' remains the creepiest movie I've ever seen (and when I say 'creepiest,' I mean that it did not leave a lasting sense of fear...it was just 'creepy.'  I still have yet to see a movie that will actually scare the wits out of me).Nothing prepared me for 'Alien.'  I already knew exactly what was going to happen, and I still found myself in the dilemma of who would live and who would die.  The suspense was incredible, almost unbearable--at the end of the movie, I felt like I was gonna hurl!  Not because of the gore (I've actually got a pretty strong stomach for that), but because of my connection to the characters trapped aboard the monstrous Nostromo.  The feeling of hopelessness, despair, stranded in the middle of nowhere and awaiting the inevitable was so effective, I almost couldn't take it.  The claustrophobic sets (especially the scene with Dallas chasing the alien through the ventilation shafts) and the grisly alien effects, combined with surprisingly good acting from the cast, made this the beginning of a new era in science fiction.  Director Ridley Scott took us where no one had gone before--into the lives of the characters fighting the trauma.Before anyone died, we got to know each member of the crew.  By the time the baby alien violently burst from John Hurt's chest (and what an amazing scene!  Oh, but don't watch 'Spaceballs' before watching this...it'll make it seem silly), we actually felt like one of the members standing around him, trying to hold him down, trying to save him but without any luck.  We had gotten a taste of everyone aboard, and every time someone died, we could really feel for them, a feeling of 'It's not fair!'The slick camera angles were another fairly influential part of the film, somewhat shaky at times but it all adds for effect, especially near the end with Ripley frantically tearing down the tight corridors, steam spewing from all around, blinding her from what's ahead and what's behind.  If only I had seen it in theatres...that would have made it truly haunting.And a clever trick from Scott...the use of our own imaginations to decide what really happens to each character.  The only person we actually see dying was Kane and the chest-bursting incident, but we only get a glimpse of what happens to everyone else.  We see a bloody Parker, hunched over lifeless later on in the movie,  but we have no clue what happened to him. We saw the alien whip around, grab him and begin a short struggle, with blood pouring from Parker's mouth when all of a sudden, the alien's second mouth shoots out and--where does it go?  Who knows...this isn't even answered in the sequel.  All we know is that it tears into some part of the body and kills them almost instantly.  Personally, I think it grabs the heart (or some other major organ) and rips it out, but that's just me.Ridley Scott must be among the most talented directors in history.  I can't see a resemblance in his directing between 'Gladiator' and 'Alien' (or 'Thelma and Louise' for that matter) besides stunning sets and stomach-churning gore.  He proves here that he can master the art of film as well as Hitchcock and Kubrick (actually, he combines both their talents in this film).  'Alien' will always remain one of the most inventive and influential additions to cinematic history.",Null,2,4,5 November 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Enjoyable, lacking plot
","First off, I'd like to answer everyone who's been comparing this and Episode I to the original trilogy.  I've got big news for all you folks...those movies were made over twenty years ago!  Sorry to say, but times have changed since then.  George Lucas isn't an idiot...he knows exactly what he's doing, and he's making movies for today's generation.  Episode I was childish, because it was made for mostly children.  Episode II is a little more mature, because those kids are a little more mature now.  And so on.With that said, let me talk about the movie....It's no masterpiece, but it was definitely enjoyable.  Anyone looking for Oscar-calibre performances will not find it here (although I do admit, Hayden Christensen did a much better job than I expected).  The Oscars suck anyways.The thread of a plot centers mostly around young Anakin, his love for Padm√© Amidala, and his short temper.  The rest is about this mysterious Clone army, supposedly built for the Republic but was not authorized to (although Yoda makes magnificient use of them in the spectacular and very redeeming final sequence).  And, of course, there's the evil Count Dooku (played disappointingly by Christopher Lee) and his army of Battle Droids. Conspiracies abound, including plans to construct the Death Star, etc., but I won't give away too much.Anyway, besides the fact that the plot barely moves and it's mostly just a bunch of action sequences and political discussions strung together, I found this movie very confusing.  Not to understand, just to look at.  Maybe I was just too close to the screen or something, but I found there were just too many creatures and too many spaceships and too much happening at once to really concentrate on what was going on (maybe this was intentional...makes you want to go back and see it again to figure it all out).  Some of the dialogue was cheesy, but that was expected.Now back to Hayden's performance; it wasn't gold, but much, much better than I had thought it would be.  He didn't seem like the little boy in the last film, but definitely like the young man who'll become Darth Vader (there's one gut-wrenching scene on Tatooine where he admits his slaughter of those barbaric sand people...nearly flawless).  He certainly seems to keep the whole film together, as he should, since the whole film's about him.One of my biggest problems with films these days are the special effects. Honestly, movies from the 80s or early 90s had better special effects than nowadays.  Why?  Because computer animation wasn't very developed yet, and they were forced to rely on things like models and animatronics, thankfully. I'm sorry, but CGI is just so obviously...CGI.  It stands out so painfully from everything else, it just completely ruins the believability of the film.  One frame can be photo-realistic, but an entire sequence?  George Lucas, please, do it the old-fashioned way next time.  I dare you.  It worked great for the original trilogy (ahh, but that brings me back to my opinion on this being a trilogy for today's generation...however, i doubt they think CGI looks any more realistic than I do).But I digress.  This isn't a bad film, not by any means.  It's a summer film...it's not one that'll leave you pondering life or anything, but it manages to get the major points across to set up for the next one, as Episode I did (much worse though).  Don't expect any cinematic epic, but it is entertaining and well worth your money (more so than other movies coming out this summer, that's for sure).  It will, however, leave you very p***ed off that we won't get to see Episode III for another three years.All in all...I want to see it again.",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
Aliens," Rocks!
","This is another rare case in which a sequel isn't worse or better than the original.  Comparing the two, 'Alien' had certain qualities that 'Aliens' was lacking, but 'Aliens', of course, had much more action and plenty of satisfying eye-candy (especially the ending!).  'Alien' was almost unbearably suspenseful, and left me as frightened as Ripley in the end, but 'Aliens' left me disappointed that it was over and begging for more. Whether or not that's a good thing, I still have yet to decide.  It seems that every time I watch it, it gets better.  Seeing it on the big screen would have really made a difference.I'd have to say that the alien effects in this film really stole the show. Believe me, you will not be disappointed with them.  Most of them look as real as the most top-notch computer animation of today, maybe even more real.  How this was accomplished still amazes me.  Everything else seemed outdated, but passable just the same.Following Ridley Scott's example, director James Cameron, whom will always remain one of my favourite directors, didn't spend too much time revealing the form of the aliens.  This makes the attacks against the marines ten times more frightening.  When you did see an alien, you were never sure of which part you saw, because they either moved too fast or the camera angle changed too quickly.  Cameron only showed what he wanted you to see, and the more he showed of the aliens, the more your heart begins to pound.  This all adds up to the gripping ending: Ripley's confrontation with the alien queen.Another element Cameron took up from Scott was excellent character development, especially on Sigourney Weaver's behalf.  Her display of both fear, anger and heroism were especially touching, and the use of Newt, a little girl and the last survivor of the infested colony, to create a mother-daughter relationship greatly increased the emotional aspect of the film, which normally doesn't work in action/sci-fi.Bill Paxton, in a role somewhat out of place, works particularly well as Hudson.  His display of confidence before landing on LV-426 quickly takes a pitfall after the first battle against the aliens, and refuses to go anywhere with a remote chance of being attacked again.  His feelings are so clear, we become just as traumatized as he is when he is forced to face them again.Other characters, such as Burke and the marines, are noticeably well done as well.  Burke, who's got a hidden agenda of his own, can easily be felt as that typical person who you feel you can trust but in the end cares only for themselves.  The other marines, on the other hand, are detailed enough so you actually care for them when they die, even if they don't seem like nice people.There are pros and cons to the special edition; I never found digitally remastered sound to make much of a difference, and I can see why some of the scenes were chosen to be cut from the original release.  Mostly, the scenes of the colony before the disaster were not particularly well done, and I suppose the film's sense of abandonment carried from the original would have worked better without them.  Of course, one scene I can't understand why it had been cut was with Burke telling Ripley that her daughter had died at age sixty-six, two years before she had been found.  Ripley explains that she had promised her that she'd be back for her eleventh birthday.  This was an especially emotional part of the film that explains why Ripley decides to accept responsibility of Newt so easily.Overall, this movie cannot be watched only once.  If you do, you'll soon find yourself desperate to watch it again.  If you haven't seen it yet, buy it, don't rent it.",Null,0,0,11 November 2000
