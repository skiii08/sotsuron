The Ring," Creepier than Joan Rivers!
","WORTH IT FOR: The incentive it gives to go get a DVD player, just incase VHS tapes kill you.IMHO: Despite what the title would have you believe there are neither Hobbits nor hemorrhoids in sight. And it's nothing to do with Christina Angulawhatever's new clip, altho I'm pretty sure you can see the ring in that... No, this is infact the heart warming tale of a video that kills you 7 days after you've watched it. I'm not sure if watching the same thing on DVD kills you, but I suppose it does. I guess it depends how close you sit to the screen, and how violent Blockbuster get when the copy of The Little Mermaid you rented is 7 days overdue. This is another horror movie involving creepy kiddies. It seems every flick that attempts to be scarey has to involve a creepy kid in someway. That doesn't make it bad tho, it is infact pretty good. The story is nice and original (it's a remake of a Japanese version which has spawned a sequel and prequel), and the cast, led by talented Aussie Naomi Watts, is great. But is it scarey? Well I was sitting in a puddle at the end, but that may have more to do with the size of the large Coke... After being told by people who had already seen this that I'd be having nightmares afterwards I packed a change of underwear and prepared for the worst, but it didn't come. Altho there are a few sudden frights (one made the girl behind me actually scream), and while you're watching it there is an undercurrent of 'What's going to happen next??' kind of scarey-ness, after it had finished I looked back and thought 'Well that wasn't really all that scarey'. It didn't haunt me like The Sixth Sense or Bambi did. So I guess you have to decide for yourself whether its scarey enuff or not. That said, I'm never watching a video again. Infact I came straight home and took an axe to my VCR. Then I jumped on the pieces. Then I burned my shoes. But no, this isn't scarey. Either way this is a good flick and its fun to watch. Go see it. But don't sit in seat S17 in Cinema 6 of Village Crown til they've had a steam cleaning done...IT'S A BIT LIKE: A horror movie involving creepy kiddies!
