Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Mixed emotions...Better than worse
","This movie is definitely worthy of what time I waited in line to buy the tickets..Obi-wan rocked!! Despite all the inconsistencies, it has a generally good plot and effects. (Although sometimes it looks like we're playing a game on the giant screen) This was the best movie I've seen on the big screen except for the re-release of A New Hope. Also, how does the sleek, colorful look of the episode one ships evolve into the boxy, plain, unpainted, ugly ships in IV,V,VI?? Lucas needed another six or eight months to work out the kinks, but overall I rank the movie a 9!! GO OBI-Wan.  May the force be with you, always.",Null,0,1,23 May 1999
