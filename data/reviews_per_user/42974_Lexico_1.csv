Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The end of an era...
","First I would like to point out the fact that I wrote this comment several times, and each time was different from the other. My idea was to make a short review of the plot, but there are so many spoilers on the other comments that it was just pointless... so I preferred to talk about the movie without actually revealing anything. Take it from someone who didn't know Tarantino until he saw Pulp Fiction, just one year ago.In a sequel that made us wait for 5 long months, Quentin Tarantino finally brings us the conclusion of an excellent story. Within the two hours, we can see the other side of the story, the non-violent side, if you will. With a lot less fights, and a lot more plot, this movie is just what the fans were waiting for.From the beginning of the movie, when it repeats exactly the initial part of the first film, I knew I was heading for something good. Just watching the reaction of people, thinking that there was some kind of mistake, was enough for me to say 'I'm gonna have a ball here'. And guess what... I did.The movie has this particular way of telling you stuff without actually showing them to you... a Tarantino trademark, one might say. Take for example a scene that show us nothing but a black screen. There's nothing left to do for us but imagine just what's going on in there, and that's what a movie is all about: get into you and make you participate, have you identify with the plot, that's the only way to have a good time. And the movie is full of this kind of stuff. Like the Bride's name, for instance. What other brilliant mind, besides Tarantino's, could possible figure out a way to make the viewer really get into the movie? From the first time, on Volume 1, when they beeped her name; it made us all see in detail every aspect of the movie, looking for that hidden name. Well, the secret is revealed in the sequel, and it sure made me say 'Quentin, you're a genius'. Those little details that make you say that... that's just good entertainment. It's not only about telling you a story, but also make you really be one with the story. He uses those kind of details to make you pay attention during the whole time.Now, in the acting part... well, I'm no judge, but Uma Thurman deserves an Oscar... it's not easy being The Bride, but somehow, she managed to do it. I would give her the Oscar for the final part only. Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell you what it is, but pay attention at the end of the movie, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Just one more thing... if you're gonna watch this movie, PLEASE, first watch Volume 1... it's against nature to see a sequel without knowing what is all about.",Null,0,1,30 April 2004
