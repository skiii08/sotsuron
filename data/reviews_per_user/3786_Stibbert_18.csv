The Rock," Tense and thrilling action
","A highly decorated General steals a bunch of rockets carrying VX-gas and takes the city of San Fransisco hostage when barricading himself and his mercenaries on Alcatraz, aiming the rockets at the city. It's all up to an ex-con that haven't seen daylight in 30 years and a scientist who's never done field-work to stop him.The Rock has a rather strong story compared to many other action movies. You really need to pay attention. The characters are great. There are really no bad-guy. You have sympathy for all of them and you get to know them as they develop through out the movie. The Rock has a couple of plots. The main goal is to put an end to the situation, but there is also Goodspeed's personal sub-plot. There are nice chemistry and interaction between the characters and the dialog is good. The movie has everything you want, drama, action, suspense and humor and it's all put together very nicely.The cast is quite a line up of stars with grand old man Sean Connery in the lead with Nicholas Cage. They fit their characters perfectly and work very well together. Their performance is great. The rest of the cast is nothing less. John Spencer does a good character of Womack and Ed Harris joins humanity and military roughness as General Hummel. All in all this is a pretty strong cast that works well together.The cinematography is great. It captures the variation in the mood very well, from a romantic love scene to an action filled car chase. It all looks great. The composition and lightening is good and it's Bay so expect nothing less than great, smooth camera moves. The editing, especially the car chase is quite nice. It's intense.This movie would be nothing without the tense, action filled score. With a nice rogue military feel to it and a recognizable theme that you'll be humming the rest of the day. It's an adrenaline booster that bring out the action and really gets you going.As for the effects they're good. They don't over do it and avoid the biggest clich√©s.All in all The Rock must be said to be one of the best action film. It's tense, thrilling and filled with action. Even if you know what'll happen you can watch it over and over and still get a kick.",8,2,3,29 October 2005
Walk the Line," Rock Solid
","I expected a movie of finest quality when I sat down to see this and I'm glad to say it exceeded my expectations! Based on real life legend Johnny Cash, Walk The Line tells the story of his turbulent life of drugs, love and music.This is a well written film. Based on a couple of books and the real life of Johnny Cash it has a pretty dramatic and strong story to tell and it succeeds in telling this story really well. The characters are strong and you get to know them, love them and hate them. It's believable and touches you.Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash is a truly great fit. His performance is nothing less than wonderful. He is believable and he got the likeness to portray Johnny Cash in every way. Reese Witherspoon also delivers a rock solid performance as June Carter. As for the rest of the cast they're also very good. Most notably is Ginnifer Goodwin and Robert Patrick as Vivian Cash and Ray Cash. They do a fine job as supporting actors.When it comes to the technical there is also nice things to say. The cinematography is good looking and the lightning is really nice. It is a really good looking film. It spans a cross several decades and they do a good job in keeping everything is style. Hair, costumes and sets, all goes to the decade.As for the music, you'll get to hear a lot of Johnny Cash. No surprise there. However, they also make use of others like Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. They make good use of the music and when the real music ends a good soundtrack by T-Bone Burnett kicks in.Walk The Line is without a doubt a movie worthy of Johnny Cash. It's all in all a rock solid film that I truly recommend. Whether you like the Man in Black or not, whether you grew up with his music or not, I recommend this movie because in the end this is a story about people.",9,0,0,25 February 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Killing the dream
","Requiem for a dream is not just a movie. It's something more. It's one of those movies that really leaves you with an impression. It moves you and it scares you.Requiem For A Dream follows four people, Harry, Sara, Marion and Tyrone and watch their hopes and dreams fall apart all for the same reason. Drugs.This is a special and out of the ordinary movie in so many ways. It's quite unique for an American movie. It has a more European look and feel to it. The story is good and strong and well written. You get caught up in it and won't leave. You don't really get to know that much about the characters, but at the same time you get so know so much you feel sympathy for them and feel that you know them. While the story may be a lot slower than you average American movie it's also a lot stronger and touches you in a way your average movie doesn't.The acting is just great. Especially Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb does a great job. She is sad, sane, insane and happy all in one movie and all at the same time. Her character is absolutely crazy and she portrays this very well. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are good actors as well and really shows it in this movie. Their performance is very good.The movies cinematography is odd. It's not typical American in any way. Never the less it's great. It's way better than in most American movies exactly because they dear to be original. Without this almost experimental kind of music video looking cinematography this movie wouldn't be as strong as it is. It's one of those things that makes this movie stick out of the crowd and makes you remember it.You can't say anything about this movie and not mention the score. It is beautiful. It's a mix between classic and electronic. It has a simple theme that is played over again and it's something you remember. It is used all through the movie and at the beginning it sounds nice while at the end is sound awful. It changes with the movie, with the mood and boost the mood very well.As for special effects this movie has actually quite a few. More than I expected, but they don't over do it. In fact I didn't really notice that they were special effects. They bring out the mood and the story very well and are also very well done.Requiem For A Dream is not one of those movies you watch and just forget. This is a movie you should watch and should remember. It's a movie I truly recommend everyone to see. If you like movies or not. This movie may not make you like movies, but I'll make you think about a thing or two in life.",8,0,1,14 October 2005
G.I. Jane," Could've been a 'must see', but ends up as 'worth a look'
","G.I. Jane follows a female soldier as she train to become a SEAL operative, not knowing her career is all just a political stunt from a Senator.This movie don't know where it's going. Is it a pure action movie or is it trying to be critical and political? While the idea in it self is interesting; let's follow a female training to become a Navy SEAL, the writing just isn't good enough. First off all you know from the second you sit down how it's going to end. Then it tries to join a political story with the personal story and don't do it very well. It simply doesn't know which one is the number one story and so the movie has problems focusing. It starts off strong looking like a political thriller just to have this story put on ice and forgotten. It's first brought back up when they realize they have to tie up the loose end it made. They aim too high making the political plot too big and the connection a bit too vague. They could've made a own movie about it and left it out of this one. The dialog contains too many cheesy punchlines witch creates a funny moment, but kind of takes the credibility from the dialog and makes it seem fake. The film tries to be realistic and accurate, but the dialog along with logical errors and other errors and mistakes becomes so obvious and such a contrast that it just makes it funny and makes you take it less serious.Demi Moore does a really good job as Lt. Jordan O'Neil and the over all acting is good. Viggo Mortensen deliver as Master Chief John James 'Jack' Urgayle and the rest of the cast is nothing less than good. They bring this movie up one or two levels, no doubt about it.As for the music it's good in it self, but the use of it is rather odd. They use some pretty tense action music for some scenes set in a slow paced political meetings. No doubt it makes the scenes more action filled and make them seem less boring, but you're not used to the combination and it seems really odd and misplaced. As for action sequences, they're tense and good. The music is generally good, both the original and non-original.The cinematography is all over good. The composition of the shots as well as the lightning is good, but what really caught my attention as really nice was the effects of the very quick shock zoom at the ambush near the end. They make good use of the camera and it's all quite nice to look at. I'd also have to mention the production design witch struck me as quite cool and fitting. The locations on the beach and in Libanon is quite nice as well. G.I. Jane is not the film of the century, nor the decade. The back of my DVD-case reads: 'If you are to watch one action movie in your life, G.I. Jane is it!'. I can think of a couple of others I'd see before this one, but it's not a waste of time. I'd say this movie don't use it's full potential and had the writing been better this could've been a must see. Still it ends up as one that's just 'worth a look'.",6,0,2,12 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A nice, entertaining and funny adventure
","Ever played Monkey Island? This film is a pirate movie in true Monkey Island style. In case you've never played that game it means lot of fun, crazy pirates, a beautiful lady and a bunch of zombie like pirates.First of all the story is good. The whole love thing is simple and not original, but who cares?! It works and the setting, characters and the whole curse thing spices up the story a lot and makes it very interesting. The dialog is very nice. It's funny, but not all too funny. That keeps the focus on the story. The characters are good and they work well together creating contrasts and showing development through the film.Johnny Depp is very good. He pulls off this whole pirate act really good and manage to take on an English accent. Orlando Bloom is nothing worse. His performance in believable and good. All together the cast is strong and preform very well. The use of English actors makes the whole thing more believable.The effects are well done. In the beginning you'll see some not exactly impressive CGI, but the rest is much better. The skeletons looks good and the explosions too. The fights are well coordinated and the rhythm of the fencing in the blacksmiths workshop is really nice.The music is also good. It's piraty and gets you in the mood. It builds up around the action and fits the movie very well. You don't pay attention too it, witch is a good thing. It means it fits the movie and the action and subconscious just affects your feelings like it should.It's a good looking movie, meaning the cinematography is good. The composition is good and so is the lightning. No shots stood out as extraordinary, but no one stood out as bad neither. It's nice shooting with some playful shots here and there and all together good cinematography.The sets and decorations also make this movie good looking. The mix of CGI and real stuff is good and the look of the costumes and the settings are believable and nice.All together I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was way better than I expected. It added a lot of comedy, but still focused on the story and managed to remain serious. I would definitely recommend this movie if your looking for a high quality, cool and funny adventure movie to watch.",8,2,5,3 December 2005
L.A. Confidential," Good, thrilling and with action on many levels
","Los Angeles in the 1950's. A classic crime story. Three LAPD detectives does their own investigations of a mass murder at a diner. Turns out it all runs deeper than at first sight. This is a classic film-noir kind of crime story. It has the elements, but a bit different wrapping. A good wrapping that is and a good story.The script is good. You have one main character, Exley, and two other part main characters Vincennes and White. There are no pointed out villain, witch sets your own mind to work, trying to figure out who the bad guy is. You get to know all three characters. You get their background and you realize why they act like they do. There are a lot of work put down in all the characters and they all work well independently, but the chemistry between them is great! The story and plot is also good. It may be a little complicated at times, but nothing you can't handle. There are always something happening and the story is always twisting. It keeps you on your toes at all times.The actors are great. There are some arsenal they've got and they use it wisely. Kevin Spacey does a really good cool, classic, Hollywood-style cop and Guy Pearce is great as the 2nd generation by-the-book-cop. Russell Crowe delivers and so does James Cromwell while Kim Basinger makes a elegant femme-fatal. Danny DeVito, you know, is Danny DeVito.Jerry Goldsmith did it for Chinatown and does it again for this one. The score is great. It sets the mood and the era and builds up the action just as it should. It's cool and classic detective style. Much the same style as in Chinatown.The cinematography is nice. The lightening and composition is good and it captures the mood very well. The decorations, sets and costumes are really 50's style and good looking. The over all look of the film is just very good.L.A. Confidential is a nice film-noir style of movie, yet it is so in it's own way. It does things it's own ways and don't end up being a bad copy. It's a good movie with a strong story. You'll most likely find this to be a very good and thrilling film with action on many levels. Recommended.",7,1,4,28 October 2005
Fargo," Thank's a bunch for this one
","Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It's down to earth and believable.Jerry Lundegaard is in some trouble. He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don't exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.The Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It's a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clich√©s and don't even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they're reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.The actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudr√ºd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.The cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.The score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It's moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It's used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.Fargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it's well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie. See it!",8,34,41,12 November 2005
The Bourne Identity," Well worth your time!
","This is one of the better action/thrillers I've seen in a long time. It's detailed and balanced and don't get to advanced and hard to follow. The Bourne Identity is a decent and enjoyable movie! One man with no recollection of who he is, is found floating in the Mediterranian with bullets in his back by some fishermen. When he comes back to shore it turns out he is wanted, but he don't have a clue why.What I really liked about this movie is that you follow the character Jason Bourne very close. You hardly vet to know more then he knows and so you kind of experience the same confusion he has. Now, while some movies that follows characters this way may get too confusing this don't. Spy/thriller/action movies may have a tendency to get very high-tech with lots of techno-babble and gadgets that can do just about anything. This movie has a great lack of these elements something I find quite nice. It gives you one less thing to focus on and it's not necessary neither as the story is well written and the movie keeps you glued. There is no need for stuff like this to cover a bad story.The cast is great. Matt Damon does a great job as Jason Bourne and Franka Potente is a good Marie. They are both good characters and you get to know them just as much as you need to relate too them. I think it's a good idea to use European actors to act Europeans and not use American as is seen a little too often. It gives more credibility to the movie. I can say the same for the use of actual locations. Like it! The effects are good. There really aren't many special effects and that's good. Cause this movie don't need any. It however got some pretty nice stunts and driving scenes that fits like a glove! The stunts are well executed and well coordinated. It simply looks good. Many action movies often contains a lot of blood. You'll find blood, but not in the same amounts as in many other films like this. There are also relatively little shooting, never the less this movie is filled with action.The movie is nice scored, however, you don't pay attention to the music. In the hottest action scenes there are low or no music and in most scenes with music the music is just way back in the background. It's not bad so why they've done this I don't know, but it works. It's like the music only affects the subconscious and does so well.All in all this makes up a pretty nice action/thriller that is well worth your time.",7,0,1,30 September 2005
The Thing," Today it's still one of the best horror films
","Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this. Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!",9,237,263,11 July 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Comedy, nothing more
","This movie is nothing more than a comedy. A very good one that is. This is a nice down to earth comedy about sex, or lack thereof.This is a well written movie. The characters are great. They're charming and believable. You really feel for the poor guy. The dialog is good. There are punch-lines, but it's not the kind of movie where all the characters always say the right thing at the right time, bombarding each other with punch-lines. That's what makes this movie so down to earth and charming. It's also what makes you relate to the character. Never the less, they've still managed to make a good dialog and make it funny. The rest of the story is also funny. Maybe because it's rather simple. You don't need to think or pay very close attention to know what's going on. There's just the storyline with the main character and no other sub-plots. The other characters supports the lead in a good way and it's they who really makes the film move forward. All together this is a funny and well written story.The actors really got the hang of this. Steve Carell is great in the lead as Andy Stitzer. His performance is down to earth and believable. He really got that little boyish and geeky look and behavior. As for the rest of the cast they do a great job in supporting him. They portrays their characters good and gives a truly good performance.There is not much to say about the cinematography. It's good, but not fantastic. There's nothing special about it, it's just plain and good. It works well. The sets and decorations are nice. There are nothing special about them neither, but they look good. The costumes are also nice. They forms and gives an impression of the characters at once and work very good.Lyle Workman scored this movie nicely. It's a score it's there, but nothing more. It builds the mood and does a good job as a score, but there are no special about it. The use of non-original music, however, is really good. It helps to give you an impression of the characters and get to know them easy and quick. It's very effective.If you're looking for a good comedy that'll make you laugh and have a good time, then this is it. It's a great and hilarious comedy with good story, directing and cast that you'll definitely find entertaining.",7,1,2,25 October 2005
28 Days Later...," Great zombie movie!
","And what's so great about it is that there are almost no zombies in it! Many movies tend to have a literally over kill of zombies. This movie on the other hand gives a more realistic and focus more about the humans involved and how the whole scenario affects them.The UK suffers a outbreak of highly contagious virus that makes people very aggressive and violent. 28 days later Jim wakes up in the hospital noticing he is the only one around. When he meets a couple of other survivors their quest for salvage begins.28 days later is a good movie and nothing less. The story is good and believable. It makes sense and is not too far-fetched. The story is well written. There are nice changes of mood and tempo. The characters are strong and believable as well. What I really like about it was that it focused more on the characters and the story then on the blood and gore. It didn't scare me as a horror movie with monsters jumping at you and a suspense and haunting music, but it's scaring in a deeper way. It shows what humans are possible of. People don't really need to be infected be a virus to do these things. That makes it much more than a horror film.The actors does a good job. You believe them and they portray the characters well. Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and Megan Burns makes a strong trio in the lead.The cinematographer does a great job in capturing the different moods and pace of the film. It changes more than once and every time it's good. There are shots that are tense and get you all on your toes and there are shots you just lay back and enjoy cause of their beauty. The cinematography features out of the ordinary shots and is all in all very good.The score is something rock like with guitar and drums and it's really nice. It's dramatic and action filled. However, there are also sequences with no music. It's just the empty sound of no one else. It accentuates the element of the emptiness.The makeup and effects are also good. However, might contradicting to the genre this is not a gore filled movie. Never the less, the effects you see are good.So, if you're looking for a good entertaining and enjoyable movie with feeling, humanity and not just the superficial 'kill the zombie' then this should be your movie of choice.",8,1,2,10 October 2005
Rules of Engagement," Interesting idea, but used all wrong
","Rules of Engagement has an interesting plot. The fact that the US start to take responsibility for what they've done out in the world could make an interesting movie, but this turns out to be just another one of the Col.Col. Terry Childers, a dedicated war hero from Vietnam, Beirut and the Gulf, is sent to defend and if necessary evacuate the American embassy in Yemen due to an demonstration gone wild. He believes the crowd is shooting and opens fire, killing 83 people. In order to preserve peace between Yemen and the US he is put on trial and his long time friend Col. Hayes Hodges is the one who's defending him.The story has it's ups and downs. It gives the characters a past and personality and does so good, but there are logical errors in there. For instance, I find it odd that there are so many children and women in a political demonstration. I also find the ending of the film and the way certain characters are portrayed very wrong. This movie had potential. It could have focused on the psychical effects of combat and how this affects a judgment or on how soldiers might break the rules of engagement during combat and show that the Devil can be unleashed even within the best man, but instead this turns out to be just another tale about a heroic soldier.The acting is rather good. Jackson and Jones makes a good team and delivers a good performance. Jones makes a good soldier and really got the attitude. Jackson is good in the courtroom and in the embassy and makes his character a little psychopath. The others are good as well.The cinematography is good. There are hand-held camera in some scenes there shouldn't be or it's a little too shaky. The over all impression of the cinematography is, however good.As for the score, Mark Isham's done a nice job. It's a nice dramatic score and it supports and strengthens the mood.All in all the movie is OK. It's a nice and entertaining story, but nothing get worked up about. The film is technically good, but it could've been better written. In my opinion it's focusing too much on the government 'conspiracy' to blame Childers, making it 'just another' conspiracy movie, but by all means a good and watchable movie.",6,0,1,8 November 2005
Event Horizon," To hell and back
","Event Horizon follows the crew of the rescue ship, 'Lewis and Clark', as they embark on a mission to respond to a distress signal emitted by a ship that disappeared seven years ago, the Event Horizon. At the time it disappeared, the Event Horizon was testing out a new drive allowing it to create a wormhole for instantaneous travel. However, something went terrible wrong.This is a rather good written film. All the elements to make a successful horror film is there and so are the characters. No, the story is not all too great, in fact if you think about it it is rather stupid and the characters could've been better, but all in all it could have been a lot worse. The only good thing about this story is that it's set on a space ship, in a locked environment. It is really not the story that is scary about this movie. Towards the end when the solution comes and there are a lot of story going on it actually starts to look more like an action movie. What makes this movie scary is the mood and the atmosphere.The acting is OK. The characters are not great so you don't get this connection too them and the actors does a decent job in bringing them to life. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are too good leads and the others does a decent job as well.When it comes to cinematography there are nothing special that stands out. It's all over good with some occasional cool shots, but you've seen them all before. There are nothing too great and original about them, but they are good and along with very good lightning they are an essential part of what creates the atmosphere witch makes this movie scary.Something that needs to be given a lot of credit for this movie being as scary as it is, is the production design. The interior of the Event Horizon and also the 'Clark' for that matter is excellent. It is creepy and good looking.The third element besides cinematography and production design that creates the atmosphere and mood and makes this movie creepy is the music/sound design. The music is good and moody, but they also make the absence of music a powerful tool.As for special effects they are good. The CGI is nothing groundbreaking. It's simply good looking, not too obvious and it does it's job.What we have here is not a movie with a scary movie. It has a good amount of gore, but like The Thing it's the excellent atmosphere and mood that makes it scary. Don't pay too much attention to the story, it's not worth it. I'd recommend this one if you like a good horror film. I think you'll be in for a decent scare.",6,1,2,27 February 2006
Big Fish," A lovable fairy-tale
","I had no expectations before watching this movie, but it impressed me in every way. A really nice feel-good movie.Big Fish tells the story about a son who's been told all kinds of fancy stories by his father, but as he grew older he started not believing the stories anymore. When he returns home after three years his father is dying and he realize he never knew the truth about him, just the stories. He starts a search to find out as much about his father as possible before it's too late.This is a very well written story. The story it self is incredible, original and interesting and John August has made a pretty nice script from it. It has a very good drive in it and it's always moving forward. It's not about reaching the goal, but the journey to get there. It's a nice mix of the present and the father's stories, reality and fiction. The characters are interesting. Ed Bloom is a very special character witch you get to know at the same time his son get's to know him. The son is also a interesting as he is changing throughout the movie. The rest of the characters are great support for these two leads.Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney does good jobs as Ed Bloom. McGregor portrays the young, a bit cartoonish, adventurer very well and Finney brings out this experienced, old, a little mysterious old storyteller very good. Billy Crudup is good as Will Bloom. He manage to portray his character a little more serious than the father and manage to follow his character as he develops. As for the rest of the cast they're good and does a great job in supporting the two leads.The cinematography is good. The lightning is nice and so are the colors. The different moods and look of the stories and the present is well captured. In addition, the design of the sets and costumes are also responsible for making this a really good looking movie.The effects are kind of cool. They're good, could maybe have been done a little bit better, but you accept it as there are no focus on them and the rest of the action is so surreal. They don't stand out compared to the rest of the movie and don't go against the current look. The story is strong and the story makes the effects, the effects don't make the story, they only build up around and support the story. They don't over do it, It's just as much that it's cool. All in all, good effects work.This movie has changes in mood and theme as the stories are a little fairytale looking and the story got both joy and sadness. The score manage to bring out the mood and the feeling of the stories and the reality in a good way.Big Fish is really one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time. You get caught up with the story as it's touching, charming, surreal, mythical, funny and a bit sad. All mixed together to a nice juicy mix. This is a movie I recommend!",10,0,0,10 November 2005
The Graduate," A Timeless Gem
","I accidentally cached this movie on TV and as I didn't have anything else to do I sat down and watched it. I'm glad I did. I've heard good things about this movie, but didn't know too much about it. Never the less I really liked what I saw. This is truly a timeless classic and one of the best films there are.Benjamin Braddock is an insecure 21 year-old who has a scholarship and a future a head of him. He just don't know what he want's to do with that future. He get's involved with Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's partner and long time family friend. Then one day the Robinson's daughter comes back home and after spending time with her, Ben sees his life heading in a new direction.The story is great. It's a story that can be cute, funny, dramatic and intriguing. The screenwriter makes use of these possibilities and does so well. The story is well written and the characters are great. You get to love them and hate them and you get to understand their behavior. There's good drift in the story and you get interested and want to watch the rest.Dustin Hoffman is excellent and nothing less. His portray of Ben Braddock is great. I don't think I've seen him deliver such a performance ever (not in those of his movies I've seen). Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson is also great. She gives her character life (or lack of) in a great way. The rest of the cast also lives up to the leads and delivers great performances.Like several films in the 60's this makes use of songs that would later become radio hits rather than a classic score. It works excellent. I, however, didn't like the way they played Scarborugh Fair three times in a row with a couple of minutes in between, but it still does the job very well and the rest of Paul Simons songs fits this movie like a glove. It sets the mood and is something more to listen to then just a score. It's different and it's excellent. The other sound work is also very good.The cinematography is really a gem. The lightning is just nice and the composition of the shots are good. Only thing that pulls the cinematography down one point is some odd zooms that not always fit in, but that's not a big issue and apart from that it's excellent. The editing is also really good. There are some pretty nice transitions at one point and the rest of the film is nicely chopped as well. It's technically very good and very enjoying to watch.The Graduate is a timeless gem. I saw it and didn't think for one second that this is the 60's. The theme is timeless and there are no particular references to the 60's. That makes this move great and enjoyable still today and I hope for generations to come. This is in my opinion a movie everyone could watch and enjoy.",9,3,4,4 November 2005
Reservoir Dogs," My way or the highway...
","This is one of those movies you simply hate or simply love. It's a quite strange and slow movie. In my case I liked it, but on the wrong day I might not have.Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a bunch of criminals who's going to rob a diamond warehouse. When things turn south they start to suspect someone is snitching. The question is who.Let's start by saying that there are a lot of talking in this movie. It's basically all just talk. It's also kind of slow and almost the whole movie takes place at only one location. It looks like it's one long scene. The story is not really original, but it's well written. It's not too deep witch is good cause if you needed to pay close attention to all the talking you would be tired after half an hour. This film is about the characters and even though you don't get to know anything about their background you get to know them. You kind of feel like one of them. They don't know each other neither and you learn to know them by the way they act and do on this particular job. The characters are well written and by the end of the movie you have a good idea of who they are.The acting is good. Many famous names are on the list, but if they don't go well together it can screw up the whole movie. This is not the case for Reservoir Dogs. On the contrary, they all work well together and everyone gives a good performance. Steve Buscemi is good as always and Madsens ice cold psycho-performance is great. Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel makes a pair of aces.The cinematography is good. Nothing really good about it nor nothing bad either. There's not any really cool shots, but there are some that sticks. The composition is really nice, but the lightning is nothing too special.One thing Tarantino really know is music. The use of non-original music is genius. It's risky as people may have a relationship to that song and so they may get the wrong impression, but Tarantino manage to succeed. It fits the scene, looks cool and sounds great. This part is really half the experience.To watch this movie you'll need to have an open mind. It's not a 'normal' movie (but then again Tarantio's not quite normal either). You can turn out to like this movie or you can turn out to hate it. I liked it quite a lot and it's a technically good movie. My personal advise; watch it!",8,1,3,10 January 2006
Thirteen Days," The days the Earth stood still...
","Thirteen Days tells the story of what happened those thirteen days in October, 1962, the event that became know as the Cuban missile crisis. It follows president John F. Kennedy and his closest team and shows how they handled the situation.This is a well written movie. The plot is good and the characters as well. It's got suspense and thrill on the outside and the inside. A lot of dialog means you'll have to pay attention all the time, but this film really need all that dialog.The acting is good. Bruce Greenwood does an excellent job as JFK and Kevin Costner is good as Kenny O'Donnell. They bring out the feeling and humanity in their characters and make them all much more alive.The cinematography is nice. Good composition and lightning. Most of the shots are nothing out of the ordinary, just plain good, while others are really nice. The editing is also very good. The way they mix black and white and color works very well and along with the occasional rough look of the color footage, it gives the movie a kind of documentary look. It kind of look like real footage from 1962.Trevor Jones has done a good job in scoring this film. The score fits the era in witch the film is set and it sets the mood and atmosphere very good.I would have to say Thirteen Days is a film that, in a good way, reflects what happened behind the scenes on those thirteen days. I was not born when these events took place and so it gave me kind of an insight into what happened and so I found it both entertaining and a little educational.",8,2,4,22 December 2005
The Godfather," A true masterpiece
","The Godfather is a true classic. What differs this movie from others is the realism and that it's very believable. I thought 2 1/2 hour would be a long time, but time really flies when you're having fun! The movie follows the Carleone family, a good old Italian-American mafia family. The year is 1946 and the drug-market is just opening. When the Carleone refuses to take any part in this business some of the ones counting on this get's mad.The movie is based on the book by Mario Puzo. It's a well written movie. A smart thing to let Mario Puzo do the screenplay as he knows all the characters and the story inside and out. The story is not a simple one and there are quite a few characters. That might make the story confusing, but if you just pay attention you'll do fine. The characters and the combination of characters are great. We have a kind of anti-hero (Michael), the boss (Don Vito), the trigger happy (Sonny), the bystander (Hagen) and more. That gives plenty of opportunities for conflicts between them. The characters are very believable and you get to know them, what kind of persons they are. The story and action is also very good. You get caught up and dragged into another world. The dialog, witch is important to this movie is well written. It's not that typical movie where everyone knows what to say at any time. There are silence and thought-breaks, that makes it all more casual and normal.The actors are very good. The have settled for nothing less than quality actors in all roles. They use Italian-Americans and that makes it all more believable. Marlon Brando and does a good job and will forever be remembered as Don Carleone. Al Pachino's performance is nothing less than great. The rest of the cast are also very good an delivers a very good performance.The cinematography is classic. There are nothing really special about it, but it's all over good. The composition is good and the lightning is nice. They've captured the mood very well. It's not happy, it's not dark, it's something in between. There are no shots that stands out in a bad way, so you don't really pay attention to it. You just focus on the story.The sets, decoration and costumes are incredible. It's very realistic. It's 40's all the way, yet you don't really think about it. You never stop to think that 'this is the 40's'. It all just comes natural. It really helps you get caught up in the movie. Not once do you think 'why don't he just pick up a cell phone?', because it all seem so realistic and well done.Nino Rota has made a forever memorable score. It's classic and easy to recognize. It makes a nice, kind of gloomy mood, and fits the rest of the movie perfect. I also like the lack of music. In the action scenes there are no music. This makes it more tense, personal and human.There are some special effects in this movies. Some blood, fights, shots and explosions, but it not that much. What there is is rather good. Some it has a little theatrical look to it and therefor I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of it. The fact that they don't literally overkill and focus on this makes the story more serious and much more believable. This movie is no action movie, but 100% drama at it's finest.The Godfater is a classic, must-see movie for everyone. It has a special place in movie history. It almost a legend. If you like movies this is not a movie to miss. It's a little long, but don't let that scare you. My tip is to watch this movie when you're up to it. If you watch at the wrong time it'll destroy you impression of it, but when you get the chance, watch it!",10,3,7,26 October 2005
