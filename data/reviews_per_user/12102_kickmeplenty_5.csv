Alien 3," Very underrated, fantastic movie
","I have to say, most people who have seen this film have seen the original two (great) movies, and are big fans of Aliens. But this movie is just too different for many of the ALIEN fans, especially after seeing the second one - it's as simple as not expecting a sequel to Aliens when you watch Alien3 - expect a different kind of Alien picture, and that's what I like so much about this sequel. So many sequels are rehashes of the original, are good movies in their own right, but with many of the same things as the movie that preceeded it, but Fincher has crafted a movie that is so different from Aliens, many people do not like this sequel. I don't think we need another Aliens movie, it's like Alien was more of a suspense horror movie, Aliens had more aliens and was more of an Action/Adventure, and now there's Alien3, more of a drama with suspense like the first. In conclusion, sometimes originality can take away in making a sequel (no wonder they make most sequels like the prequels!), which is why I think it shouldn't have been called Alien 3.As for the film itself, Ellen Ripley lands on a prison colony planet, and a xenomorph on her ship kills everyone but her, and the alien starts killing people and whatnot. There is great acting, and a fantastic end.In conclusion, expect Fincher, and not another ALIENS, and you could enjoy it very much.9 out of 10(P.S. The worst in the series is Alien Resurrection, but that one isn't so bad - but it's more like Aliens).",9,0,2,22 August 2001
Requiem for a Dream," The best of 2000. Period.
","You know Darren Aronofsky is a great director when you see his name above the title in large letters, and it's only his second picture (the first being the excellent Pi).Requiem follows the tale of four people's journey into spiraling into addiction, whether it be food, cocaine, weight-loss pills, etc, etc. The message hear is clear: Addiction can come in any form, any shape or size. But the movie NEVER becomes preachy, and does not hesitate to show graphic images (if you are looking for lots and lots of nudity, you will sorely be disappointed) of the drug's effect, using what Aronofsky appropriately, 'Hip-Hop Montage', which is basically quick images and sounds thrown at the viewer, along with many fast-forward parts, during the drug scenes. All of this style really shouldn't work with the subject matter, and turn it into nothing but an MTV film (cough, The Cell, cough, Hallow Man, cough, cough) and is probably the first serious drama that used so many special effects shots (keep your eye out for the revolutionary 'Snorrie Cam', which is a camera attatched to a person's body part, like the head) but...the whole thing is successful.PlotEllen Burstyn plays an overweight mother who just gets a call to be on a game show. Excited, she tries on her 'red dress', which doesn't fit, and ends up resorting to weight-reduction pills (which are really speed) and the red dress is her source of the addiction, she wants to get in the dress, but the pills have horrible consequences.Then, there are three drug dealers (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly) hoping to make it big on a sale. Their own paths change, for the very worst.The plot's simple, the charcters are four-dimensional. In fact, all four actors probably give their best performances ever, and Burstyn actually deserved that oscar more than Julia Roberts - her character is the most human, and, like the whole cast, totally believable. Marlon, fresh off of Scary Movie, also shows that he is indeed a great actor.The Bad?The whole thing is very dark. Too dark for some. If you are a little squemish, or faint of heart, please avoid this film. You may think, 'Hey, it's just a movie', but some people have been actually pretty disturbed by its dark nature (It was released to only a few theateres because Artisan knew the NC-17 would give it the flush. It should have been called 'Requiem for a Nightmare'.Overall, if you find it at a store, pick it up (the DVD is especially great) and watch it with a high school student or by yourself or whatever (this is definitely not a date movie), just watch it. Better than Gladiator in my book.",Null,1,1,14 June 2001
Memento," No matter how great a movie comes out in 2001, it will not be better than Memento
","Memento is the first truly original film since 1999's Fight Club. It's the kind of 'mind-trippn'' (I call it) movie that really makes you think during it's whole running time. In brief, it follows the story of a man (Guy Pearce) who only wants to avenge his wife's murder and rape. The catch? He has short term memory loss, which means he cannot make any new memories of anything after 15 minutes, so he lives in fifteen minute segments, the only thing he has got is a polaroid camera, notes and tattoos of things to follow, in order to find the killer. The film poses many questions, and, trust me, if I tell you any more about it, the movie won't be as great as a first-time viewing.There really isn't much else to say - except that the film is filmed very differently than your average picture.Once again, all I have to say that this is one helluva film. Better than Pearl Harbor even.Just go. now. to the theater.11/10",10,0,1,25 May 2001
Cast Away," Hanks' performance completely saves what could have been another boring survival flick
","At it's heart, Cast Away is simply a survival picture telling the tale of a man's isolation and lonliness for over four years on a desolate island, lacking any large amount of food, or even wildlife, in the tropics. So lonely, in fact, Chuck Nolan (Hanks) spends some time speaking to a volley ball for half of the movie, and even crying for it's loss. This could have been a hilarious situation, something for a Saturday Night Live parody of the 'Survivor' TV series, but Hanks is so convincing and human in his performance, he doesn't hold anything back. You can't help be sad for the poor volleyball's (named 'Wilson') fate, when really you, the audience are sad for Hanks losing his sanity while adrift in a wood raft (the director, Robert Zemeckis, sure has a good way of manipulating the audience). There are also many special effects in Cast Away that one wouldn't notice, just take for granted as part of the filmming - there are many SFX scenes in Cast Away, but none of them are used for 'eye candy', like many, MANY other films today. You just can't help but root for Hanks throughout the entire movie, so he can get off that stinking island. Also, the bulk of the film, when Nolan is on the island after the plane crash (which is easily the best scene of last year, 2000), will totally immerse you into his isolation, thanks in part to no cutting back to what's going on back where his girlfriend is waiting for him - so many movies have been ruined in part to this, (The Perfect Storm a great example). Instead, the characters tell him what happened later on. And somehow, there is little to no dialogue in the 'survival' bulk of this movie but it never gets boring. NEVER. Zemeckis should have taken a hint while making What Lies Beneath in between Cast Away.Not that Cast Away is perfect.The film loses steam when Nolan returns home, but there are still some great scenes ahead, but once again, I am not bought on Helen Hunt in the role of Nolan's motivation for going on and trying to get off the island (there is a short scene involving him hanging himself). Just like in Pay it Forward, she's not too convincing and is best suited for Richard Gere chick flicks like Dr. T and The Women.And no - the trailer didn't reveal much about the film. You see - Cast Away isn't about plot - it's about damn good acting.9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,6 August 2001
Braveheart," This would have been a very mediocre film if it weren't for Gibson
","I like my epic movies. Some stand out of the crowd more than others, and some are very overrated, like this one. The plot is very predictable, and leaves you waiting until what you expect will happen next.The plot is your simple, you-killed-my-wife-so-now-I'm-going-to-kill-you-all-of-you-evil-minions revenge plot fueled by many soldiers willing to aid the protagonist because the evil dude is well...evil. The score is good, but darn it sounds like the one from Titanic! Celine Dion would be spinning in her grave if she was dead.Then what saves the movie? Mel Gibson's Wallace character is totally riveting, likable and believable, with lots of - gasp - depth.On a whole, though, Braveheart is too long for it's own good, (sort of like 2000's Traffic). Patriot was better. It was shorter. This is almost four hours long. Go see Lawrence of Arabia instead. It's the only movie which remains very...'intelligent' throughout it's whole length.",Null,0,2,19 June 2001
