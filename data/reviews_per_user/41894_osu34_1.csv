3:10 to Yuma," Awesome movie, some of the cast is missing from the cast list tho.
","I thought that the movie was incredible, probably the best western of our time. One person that i did see in the movie that was not on the list of cast was Luke Wilson, he was one of the men in the Chinese camp that was laying railroad for Pinkerton, he was then killed by Russell Crowe's gang. Crowe captured the evil in his role, as well as when he finally does something good. Bale played his part to the T. This movie was by far one of the most accurate westerns that i have seen. The movie is a must see, the only reason that this movie will get bad reviews, is because it is a western, and most people don't care about westerns, because of some stupid reason they would rather see the same damn movie being made over and over again about high schoolers getting drunk and partying, and the actors are in their late 20's and early 30's People are ridiculous.",10,1,3,8 September 2007
