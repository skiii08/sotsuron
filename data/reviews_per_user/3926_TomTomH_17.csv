The Avengers," Outstanding! The Best Action Movie Ever!
","Avengers Assemble is the best superhero film ever made. I thought it was better than The Dark Knight and as soon as it started, I felt like seeing Harry Potter all over again at the cinema. It mainly follows up from 'Captain America: The First Avenger', 'Thor' and 'Iron Man 2', S.H.I.E.L.D boss Nick Fury brings together a group of human superheroes who have different identities and events in their pasts: Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr), Hulk (Edward Norton is out. Mark Ruffalo is in), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) with S.H.I.E.L.D assassins: Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Bourne Legacy's Jeremy Renner) to stop a villain from destroying earth forever. The massive battle scene is incredible. Strangely enough besides that there's a bit more laughter in this than any other SH film. I don't know how the sequel's going to turn out to be. After you've seen this you'll be asking the same question as me: how will it make it bigger and better? It's like 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' but the autobots replaced as Marvel superheroes, without Shia LaBeouf and decepticons replaced as the villain's giant army.",8,4,10,11 June 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Better, shorter and darker than it's predecessors
","This is the best Pirates so far. It brought numerous occasions down to lower levels such as action sequences, murderous moments, length and plot; but darker than the previous films. The story is much easier to follow than the last sequel (At World's End). Captain Jack Sparrow and Mr. Gibbs go on a hunt to find the Fountain of Youth. But it's not just them that are hunting for it alone: Blackbeard and his daughter Angelica are after it too. Brimming with swashbuckling special effects and thrilling moments, this film gives another cinematic experience of pirates, treasure hunting, scary stuff and sword fighting. A franchise and film that could carry on to do more sequels but wait until you've watched it to agree.",6,0,0,6 July 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Spectacular!
","J.J. Abrams' 2009 reboot was slightly disappointing for me. I felt that it needed a little bit of an extra boost of action to keep science-fiction\action film lovers (like me but except I like not love it) occupied with the system. After 4 years, it's surprisingly and (I think for many) expected sequel arrives to prove that a follow-up to a successful movie could be more successful and approval over the first outing and yes J.J. you've done it this time!'Star Trek Into Darkness' is a knockout sequel which overlaps the action and excitement of it's predecessor. I never watched the original 'Star Trek' series but anyone who's a newcomer, like me, to 'Trek' you should give this a go.The ensemble cast return again as the young vision of the Star Trek team (Chris Pine: Kirk, Zachary Quinto: Spock, Zoe Saldana: Nyota Uhura, Simon Pegg: Scotty, Karl Urban: 'Bones' McCoy, John Cho: Sulu, and Bruce Greenwood as Christopher Pike) with 'Trek' newcomer Alice Eve (Carol Marcus) on board. 'Sherlock''s Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Kahn, the next suspicious and dark villain (after the strange and average villain Nero, portrayed by Eric Bana in the predecessor) who wants to destroy Earth, without making any spoilers at all. I must admit he's quite good at playing Kahn and even especially for Simon Pegg, who plays Scotty. He's got a bigger part in this than the first entry, even funnier, in which is what Pegg's normally like. He isn't as brilliant as in his films with Nick Frost (Paul, Hot Fuzz and hopefully in the upcoming The World's End) but he's still quite good.The special effects are dazzling. You see shots of CGI London in 2000 years away from skyscraper view which works well with the 3D. You can see St. Paul's Cathedral (I didn't see it) still hanging there if you take a lookout (this isn't a spoiler it's a hint). There's many futuristic buildings lying around to make it look like a typical futuristic city unlike in present day. Did I mention the 3D? Yes I did. And just to let you know the 3D is incredible. Like with the special effects it stands out with the film and introducing the world of 'Star Trek' to non-Trekkies (like me) in an exciting way. According to Abrams, they shot the film in Imax (which probably has some very good Imax shots) and converting the film into 3D during post-production, expecting the experience to be slightly ruined by the unnecessary use of 3D because believe me, I seen many films at the cinema that have bad uses of 3D (like Gulliver's Travels and Narnia 3 and many more which I can't think of), but unbelievably, I've never seen any converted-3D film as good as this. And because of this, this is one of the best films I've seen in 3D, and the first 3D film in converted 3D which I like the most. Especially Abrams' lens flare trick (read Abrams' Empire issue for info) which works well with the 3D (look out for that as well).Abrams boosts some exciting, thrilling and noisy action sequences to the film, more powerful than it's predecessor's. But UNLIKE it's predecessor, other than the gun and Enterprise fights, the face-to-face fight scenes are just brutal. Just punches until it goes too far. Probably Abrams' writers, Robert Orci & Alex Kurtzman (Transformers 1&2) and Damon Lindelof, wanted to add more violence to make it more thrilling. No luck, just unnecessary (you'll understand once you're watching it). Don't be disappointed. You'll agree.There's still plenty Enterprise ship battles, Abrams hasn't left those bits out. Goodness no he hasn't.Just to remind you, this isn't Star Wars from George Lucas. It's Star Trek from J.J Abrams. Speaking of which, Abrams is going to helm 'Episode VII' next. Don't you just think for a minute that Abrams slow down with science fiction?It may be the start of Summer 2013 according to rumours, but 'Darkness' could be part of the beginning of it. It's a summer blockbuster that packs a powerful villain (played by a professional actor) an understanding (and maybe sometimes be incomprehensibly confusing) plot and good and exciting action and 3D (that'll quite possibly turn up in upcoming action blockbusters (such as Pacific Rim, Man of Steel and more). Out of everything I've said about this film, it's a successful and must-see sequel you should catch in the cinema before it's too late because (I think) it's the only best experience for it (I saw this before May Half Term so I'm sending in a late review).",7,3,8,6 June 2013
BlacKkKlansman," Deep, smart, powerful, funny and emotionally investing, BlacKkKlansman is a triumph
","Movies about the darkest parts of history are difficult to pull off. In the era of Trump, Hollywood has started to focus on race and politics more than ever, with the likes of Get Out, The Purge, The Death of Stalin, Detroit and so on. BlacKkKlansman, Spike Lee's latest 'joint' (his stylised possessory credit), explores messages, social commentary, themes and ideas as deep as possible. Not a second is wasted on what it's trying to say, while its engrossing storyline is told with sweeping energy, creative freedom and emotion. I haven't seen race and racism displayed so effectively in cinema for a very long time.The movie centres around the true story on the racist troubles of Ku Klux Klan during the 1970's. The police service of Coronado Springs attempts to take them down with the help of a young African-American named Ron Stallworth, the first in the department.Punctured by a smart screenplay by David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott, Charlie Wachtel and Lee, Lee's approach to the event clearly shows his vision wasn't interfered by an uncompromising bankable studio. Cinematographer Chayse Irvin wisely chose to shoot on 35mm and 16mm film, creating a serious old-school 70's vibe where at times characters are slightly out of focus and the sunlight is overexposed due to the sensitivity of the film stock. Wes Anderson-like techniques are frequently present here, with closeups of images that fill the screen, quick pans, dolly shots that go from character to character (especially in one scene) and a few beautiful dreamlike shots that unintentionally pay homage to Bohemian Rhapsody. This is what sets the film apart from others, adding a scoop of creative juice within the storytelling.John David Washington's first acting role, son of Denzil, is a knockout. He really digs deep into the psychology of Stallworth and nails it onscreen. In his big break from playing Kylo Ren between 2017's The Last Jedi and Episode IX in 2019, Adam Driver puts on another great performance as Flip Zimmerman, with his laid back presence lighting up every scene he's in. Topher Grace's career has officially been revived with this movie after going out of the spotlight since Spider-Man 3. He somehow fits into the role of David Duke with his talent to be serious and ends up being taken as comedic.There are a few fizzles along the way. Lee's ability to occasionally break the 180-degree rule for effect and use multiple shots on a single action can come across as jarring. Sometimes Barry Alexander Brown's editing from scene-to-scene are blink-and-you'll-miss-it transitions, jumping to the next stage way too fast.Besides these issues, the whole thing flows pretty well. I don't think we'll seeing anything as satisfying as this in a very long time. One of the best films of 2018.",8,6,10,6 September 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A huge improvement over the first with a touch of tone from The Avengers! Let's hope it carries on that way.
","It's been three years since the First Avenger made it to the big screen and has made his move going through the Marvel marathon starting with his first solo movie and then continuing with 2012's crossover Avengers movie. He's played by Chris Evans, the guy (the actor not the other one) that played Johnny Storm/Human Torch in Marvel's Fantastic Four movies if that sound's familiar to some.As Captain America/Steve Rogers still struggles settling into the world he's living in after defeating the Hitler-like villain Red Skull in World War II and then waking up in the modern world in the disappointing first movie, a new threat comes in sight: the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier. But with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury (the 65-year-old Samuel L. Jackson), Falcon (Anthony Mackle) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) beside him, he can defeat the threat once and for all. If it is possible to stop him.Unlike many badly developed super villains like Parallax from the dreadfully disappointing 'Green Lantern', Red Skull from the first Captain America movie and General Zod from the last year's dreadfully unevenly paced Man of Steel, the Winter Soldier is not a badly developed super villain; he could be one of the best. He wears a mask that seems far more complex than the one Tom Hardy's Bane wears in The Dark Knight Rises. At one point I thought it was played by The Hobbit's Richard Armatage (Thorin Oakenshield) but he wasn't, it was played by Sebastian Stan.There's a new hero in town: Falcon (Sam Wilson, real name), a new superhero that can fly like a talented bird of prey. He is played by Anthony Mackle who you may recognise from last year's 'experimental' Gangster Squad. When he and Cap have screen-time together, I thought it was familiar to the Iron Man duo (Robert Downey, Jr. and Don Cheadle). Scarlett Johannson's Black Widow probably has more screen-time than in previous films. Her hair style's changed from short to long, but her fight scenes certainly haven't changed.This is probably a Marvel movie we've been waiting for. If you've watched 'Avengers Assemble' you may find a few elements in this a little familiar. This is proof that the Marvel movies are getting better. Before 'Avengers Assemble', some of the Marvel movies were average. It was the 'Thor' and 'Captain America' predecessors that sucked, and a little of the Hulk remake (not completely) but no way the Iron Man predecessors sucked, although it was said that Iron Man 2 wasn't as good as the original, it doesn't mean to say it sucked.So this is how the sequel is and should be taught as: bigger, better, and darker than its predecessor. Because the predecessor was set back in World War II time, it had old fashioned superhero set-pieces meanwhile this one has modern Avengers-like set-pieces. Although this is way better that The First Avenger, I'm not sure whether this even beats off Iron Man 3 but it is the best Marvel film since it though.Like I've said, it keeps close to 'Avengers Assemble', but doesn't beat it (probably next year's Age of Ultron will very well do). The action is exhilarating but unlike Iron Man 3 and Avengers' action, this action had less excitement in its heart to thrill me. I'm not completely criticising it all, but one little inch in perspective. This is a BIG sequel but its action had no heat-pounding substance to blow me away; I don't know it may be me or 'it'; you'll have to see for yourself.Ah yes, the one I must never forgot: the 3D. Now here's my verdict: good but not challenging enough. It's eye-popping, with the close-ups of faces, but in this one no stars and stripes shield comes flying at you or other catchy effects. It could be worth seeing in 3D if you're really bothered, but I don't think it matters, the experience is probably mainly for 2D but it's up to you.Like Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, The Winter Soldier is a 'true' sequel, even if it's trapped within the Marvel universe. It's not like Star Trek into Darkness where you could actually watch that sequel before the first one and it actually makes sense, the first Cap America you need to see before this one otherwise you probably won't know what the heck is going on (well maybe in the first act).Although this is probably the best one since Iron Man 3, its hero probably isn't the best of the Avengers. Some may find him a little boring. He has a steel shield that can be used for throwing and bouncing off things like a boomerang; without it, he can only use his fists. Not many powers for him. He's like Thor: he has a steel hammer that he throws and comes back to him unhanded. Don't you like superheroes with only one piece of weaponry and that's it? I don't really notice that. I just respect superheroes the way they are; not with how much weaponry they've got.Marvel still goes on with humour, especially after 'Avengers Assemble' that was funnier than probably any other superhero movies at the time. A little amusing when Sam Wilson/Falcon asks Cap which people would be the bad guys during a fight. I would ruin the answer for you. There are still some wacky action moments too. There's one when Cap single-handedly takes down a ship in less than 10 seconds. But it's too quick to get you enthralled.Captain America is going well and hopefully will keep doing it as well in the future. Who knows what he has in store for his next outing. And by the way, stay for the end credits; otherwise you'll miss something special",7,0,2,12 April 2014
Life of Pi," Spectacular 3D, Outstanding VFX and Talented Acting!
","Ang Lee's 3D VFX film adaptation of Yann Martel's 2001 award-winning book of the same name, 'Life of Pi', is such an amazing film with stunning artwork. Sitting in the cinema last night with friends, it was quite a jaw-dropping experience. I've got to say this would be impossible to do with real animals. Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger, if he was real, not CGI, would have not been easy on set. The way they animate the tiger and background is incredible. Whenever I saw a clean shot of the boat (that Pi and Parker sail in) and the sinking ship, it reminds me of the look of the animation they do in Spielberg's Tintin.Pi's life is told in three stages: childhood, teenage life and adult. The adult stage is quite emotional. The story is delivered by adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) retelling the story about his unbelievable past life to a writer (Rafe Spall, Prometheus). Pi's childhood (portrayed by Gautam Belur, age 5 and Ayush Tandun, age 13) starts with him being bullied at school because of his unusual name, which then he shortens, but still causes teasing. He soon begins to become interested with different religions which causes some amusement. His father owns a zoo and he teaches Pi how to take care of the animals. These lessons Pi's been taught helps him later on in his life. The teenage Pi's life (portrayed by Suraj Sharma) begins his perilous journey when sailing on a ship moving to Canada, when his family agree to move from India. On the way, Pi and the ship encounter a heavy storm which ends up sinking the ship and him ending up on a lifeboat, becoming the only (human) survivor. While lost at sea with no hope, he discovers that a tiger (Richard Parker) has come aboard. Although he knows the tiger wants to kill him, he eventually works out a way to control him. Thinking about Parker, he reminds me a little bit of Aslan from C.S. Lewis' Narnia series; when he walks and roars and uses tiger facial expressions, but not when he attacks. He's a lot fiercer than Aslan, who is more calm and friendly.For Suraj Sharma (teenage Pi), this is his first ever acting debut in film and already he's received his very first Bafta nomination for the Orange Rising Star Award category (and that's what I think he deserves). He brings a touching and rewarding performance as Pi, I think he's the perfect choice for the role. It's special effects and 3D are fantastic. Whenever you see the animals and human extras, you even wonder if their completely CGI. Of course whenever I saw Richard Parker I knew it was going to be computer-generated, but I've just learnt that four real tigers were used in some shots. and you still can't tell which is which. It would have been completely impossible to film right out at sea, so thanks to computer-generated imagery, it couldn't be easier. The 3D effects are incredible (like Martin Scorsese's Hugo but in a different way). This isn't a gimmick. No. These are unlike the other 3D films we see today in which 3D is sometimes unnecessary. Lee (I think) uses 3D almost like they use it on 3D wildlife channels on 3D TV. In this film the animals look as real as on a wildlife programme. You wonder how they manage it, and that's what gives the film an amazing look. At one point it feels like the sea will spill into the cinema. You'd be amazed. Life of Pi is a film that should be seen in 3D to experience the special effects. It isn't the best film I've ever seen but I still think it's spectacular. A must-see!",8,9,16,13 January 2013
Baby Driver," So what happens when you mix a music video with a mediocre action movie? You get a strangely fresh, audacious and sassy crime musical from the director of Shaun of the Dead
","As I watched Edgar Wright's Baby Driver, another movie came to my mind in comparison: Nicholas Winding Refn's Drive. These movies are in many ways different but are both about getaway drivers with strange names. Despite its visual style and all the talent involved, Drive disappointed me personally due to all the over-hyped acclaim from critics and its excruciatingly slow pace all the way through. Baby Driver makes Drive look like Battlefield Earth. This is a movie with enough fun and originality to tick the boxes off to becoming one of the better summer blockbusters of 2017. After his clashing involvement with Ant-Man, Edgar Wright is back on track again, even though this isn't his best work.Here we have Baby, a getaway driver working for a mob boss with a gang of rivals, but he has a special trick up his sleeve he has compared to the others: he can listen to music for 24 hours straight and while he drives, playing different songs that demonstrate the mood that he feels at every moment. He comes across a waitress named Debora (played nicely by Lily James) who he starts to date, but then a final job pops up in the pipeline that causes everything going for him to be sacrificed. Some plot points feel familiar here, but it is the superpower-like idea of music that gives them a shakeup. Had it not been present, the movie would feel unoriginal obviously, but the cast may have saved it from becoming a disaster. Who knows and who cares? What we have here is good enough.This is writer/director Wright's first film to be shot in the United States, which feels like a risky detour for his filmmaking roots, but the end result is, after his four-year directorial absence since The World's End, he luckily hasn't skipped a beat. This is his most unlikely film since Scott Pilgrim vs. the World but is thankfully and once again a very good, if not quite great, feature. You see and feel his love for music and cars, but his trademark style is often hard to find. There are no comedic scene transitions (probably as this isn't billed as a comedy) in the editing and his frantic camera movements have dialled down slightly, which makes his latest feature all the more interesting and experimental.The other thing that makes this a different Wright movie is the use of an all American cast: Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Ansel Elgort, Jon Hamm, Lily James, you name it, a bit of a Tarantino-like collaboration going on. Elgort is flat-out amazing as Baby, conducting an often expressionless character but with a confident brain. He has the heart of an old school heartthrob in the music scenes and is engagingly subtle in the more intense scenes. Spacey is as good playing an average mob boss as he can ever be, while Foxx is on fine form and Hamm is what you can expect from a cut-throat mob rival as he pulls off rough facial expressions.To call this a Mamma Mia! for people who didn't like the 2008 hit would be an understatement. Car chases and shootouts are present, but songs in the background give the crime genre a layer of soul, creative juice that has been thrown off so often by bleak atmosphere and bloody violence. There are a few long takes of singing that try to compete with the musical numbers from La La Land but with already published lyrics. Whenever the songs are absent, the film descends into action thriller territory and leaves you yearning for the next cue. When they're rolling, the film is a music video stretched to feature length.While starting well and ending with hope, it drags slightly midway through as it bogs down telling the story in a serious manner, and the final showdown feels a tad formulaic, forgetting to be original like the rest of the movie. But they are saved by a jazzy atmosphere and nicely chosen songs (look out for Queen). It isn't as wacky as Scott Pilgrim nor as funny and iconic as the Cornetto trilogy, and the cinematography and costume design are nothing special, but what you can safely say about Baby Driver is that it is not a noisy and soulless migraine like the rest of modern action flicks. It has a brain, confidence at influencing pop culture and, finally, a bit of pride for writing and directing in the action genre. Now that's really saying something.",7,5,11,6 July 2017
Hugo," A well-scripted, masteredly directed and a spectacular 3D extravaganza that deserved to win Best Picture!
","Last December I saw 'Hugo' with my friend and it's one of the best films I've ever seen. The set design is fantastic, the special effects are unbelievable, the relationships between the characters are lovable. But most of all that's special about this masterpiece is the brand new pure 3D. This film is the next step up to 3D. Cinematographer Robert Richardson did some perfectly good shots where the 3D would stand out. It really feels like your actually inside Hugo's adventure. Loads of stuff come towards you. It's actually the best 3D film I've ever seen. I thought the effect was better than Cameron's 'Avatar' and should've been shot also with Imax 3D cameras as well. Scorsese has the soul of master storytelling. An artist that's switched from violence to magic. A love poem for the magic of cinema. It brings back long-time true stories and old film clips that could've been lost. A Parisian orphan boy, a mechanical man and a bookworm girl who've been wrapped up into a mystery from his late father. The main people that worked so hard on this film are mostly Martin Scorsese, Graham King, John Logan, Robert Richardson, Dante Ferretti, Francesca Lo Schiavo and mostly the author that wrote and all of this into one book, Brian Selznick who's got an enchanted mind of clocks, mechanical men, 1930's, mystery and magical twists. By the time you've finished watching you'll be able to have the true feeling of cinema.",8,13,19,10 June 2012
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," This is overall a whimsical and often magical starter to a series that stands on its own without even trying to better its predecessor.
","Fifteen years after the release of the Philosopher's Stone and five years after Deathly Hallows: Part 2, the prequel/spin off cycle of beloved franchises has continued with the Harry Potter franchise, and its finally one done right. Since the news of J.K. Rowling developing a spin off in 2013, I've had huge speculation on what it would be. Three years later, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is upon us and it's safe to say that the magic is back and it's untouched.The risk about a spin-off is whether it is rich like the products that spawned them, but there is no sign of that here because this is written by Rowling herself. As the creator of this universe, she writes with passion and almost perfect understanding of what fans want. You can tell through every line of dialogue, set piece and character that she has her fingerprints trademarked all over them. Instead of setting another story in Hogwarts, she makes the fresh decision to set it in 1920s New York.Here we meet Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) whose visiting the city with a suitcase full of magical creatures. The community has strict guidelines and does not allow creatures in it. His problem starts when his creatures suddenly start to escape and cause havoc across the city. He has to make the challenge of trying to find them.Redmayne shines as Newt, having the quirkiness and maddening cheerfulness of Matt Smith's Doctor Who. He's often funny and charismatic, a different hero from Daniel Radcliffe's dive at the main man of the story. Him and Rowling have done a nice job at crafting a perfect protagonist for the next big fantasy series.Colin Farrell plays Graves whose in charge of the Magical Security in the city. He's fairly good, relying on lead villain territory heavily and never collapsing into cliché as much. Dan Folger plays Newt's sidekick Jacob Kowalski whose a surprisingly likable supporting character. He's charming and full of interest like his leader. Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol are spellbinding too as sisters Tina and Queenie who help Newt on his quest.David Yates does just about a good job at directing this as he did with the last four Potter films, but due to the alterations of the universe, it feels seamless. This is because he's kept to his rules of bringing this world to life with real sets and impressive CGI. His directness has a Tim Burton-like feel that really makes the film extraordinary but different. The action scenes under his wing are impressive but not necessarily more effective than anything we've seen before. He'll be directing the next four films in this series so there's a guarantee that he will do justice again.'Fantastic Beasts' isn't quite as fantastic as it thinks it is. While the plot is surprisingly original, it feels occasionally thin when it comes down to Newt and Kowalski trying to capture the creatures over the city. It sometimes feels like video game montage than your average fantasy quest. Also as this is the first part of the series, there's a lot of heavy world-building exposition to be done, which sometimes overlaps and wobbles the pace a little bit.Now that the setup has surfaced, Rowling and Yates can now do more of whatever they want next time round. While it isn't as intelligent as the best Potter films, it kindly resolves the problems of the more average entries of the series. It's one of the biggest pleasures of the year, like what Star Wars: The Force Awakens was in 2015. This could be the benchmark for all spin-offs to come: fresh and pretty much its own thing.",7,1,3,21 December 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Hail Marvel! Electrifying, emotional, surprising and mind-bending, Avengers: Endgame is the culminating epic we have all been waiting for
","After 11 years and 22 films in the making, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become one of the ballsiest experiments ever taken in cinematic history, and one that has captured entire generations. Perhaps the most anticipated blockbuster since Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avengers: Endgame marks the culmination of the first 3 phases of this forever running series, wrapping up multiple storylines and character arcs in the process.After the shocking and devastating events of 2018's Infinity War, the original Avengers are left stranded on Earth with no clear path of their futures. The mad titan Thanos wiped out 50% of the population and the world has become something of an apocalyptic wasteland. They can either move forward and live different lives or find a way to bring back what was once present.The second of a two-part finale is shaped over a 3 hour and 1-minute runtime, and the result is a roller coaster ride unlike anything Marvel has ever done before. If Infinity War was the ultimate fan film, Endgame is a different beast. Its predecessor was an ensemble piece, a simple good-vs-evil plot populated with multiple characters while blending humour and character motivations to spectacular effect. This is more like an old fashioned epic, channelling ambition, scope, and storytelling as dense as films from Lawrence of Arabia to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.Screenwriters Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely and directors Joe and Anthony Russo work hard to focus on the right elements of the storyline, without disastrously going off the rails. The script is mostly absorbed with the past, creating not just a sense of nostalgia and poignancy, but overall a unique viewpoint on the past 22 films. It makes you realise how far these characters have come, which feels satisfying. Even if the action and special effects are, for the most part, impressive, the film's strong point is the character focus, which was the perfect direction to take.There are a few stumbles along the way. The pacing can be bumpy across 3 hours, especially when expositional scenes frequently overstay their welcome. You cannot help but feel overwhelmed at times due to the overstuffed amount of story, which can make action scenes feel less satisfying than they should. But for a finale as monumental as this film, not everything can work. There are more stories to tell, but there is no doubt that anything following on will come close to matching the brilliance of Endgame.Finally, this is a Marvel film that demands repeated viewings. Mark my words!",8,0,5,6 May 2019
Toy Story 4," An inessential, but incredibly entertaining fourth entry of an all-time great movie series
","Toy Story 4 - yep, you read that right - is finally here. The sequel nobody asked for comes 9 long years after the 3rd, 20 after the 2nd and 24 after the original. Fourth instalments can be risky business, and the question remains if Pixar can make one without tarnishing childhood memories and a concept that worked 3 times in a row.Leave any concerns at the door. While it feels like an offshoot in comparision to the original trilogy, the surprising part of this third sequel is how well it works. It's same-old same-old, exactly how it should be, but the filmmakers have triumphantly brought the series back to life without it looking like a fluke. It cooks up everything you could possibly want from a Toy Story film, nothing more, nothing less.The plot continues years after Andy gives his childhood toys to Bonnie before going off to college. A sensitive new toy Forky joins the gang as Bonnie and her parents embark on a holiday, which goes in another direction. Woody, ending up at an amusement park while on the way, bumps into Bo Peep as a completely different person. She has a confident and warrior type of personality compared to what she was like previously. It's an intriguing piece of character development that Pixar has rarely attempted to do.In nearly a decade of development, screenwriters Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom have mostly succeeded at reviving the humour and character moments that have made the series so memorable. They tell a story that repeats the franchise's old school tropes without them feeling stale, and the addition of Forky makes all the difference. His dialogue scenes with Woody alongside the overarching theme of existentialism create a sense of freshness in the formula. These small inclusions are what the film required, in order to stand out.Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and the ensemble cast work hard with the material they are given. The latest members of the voice cast are nothing short of brilliant. 20 years after The Matrix, Keanu Reeves reinvents himself once again as Duke Kaboom, a voice role he was born to play. Keegan Michael-Key and Get Out director Jordan Peele have tons of fun voicing Ducky and Bunny, bantering with one another as if they're dressed up as their characters on stage. They have such great chemistry that many would hope that they get a spin-off TV show together someday. The newbies are franchise characters you never knew you needed, and who knows what Pixar will do with them in the future.Prepared to be wowed by the animation, as it takes the divisive 'uncanny valley' effect to the next level. Though this isn't stop motion animation, it's a perfect example of how computer animation can smash through the surreal window towards reality. Unlike many computer animated films of the past few years, every shot looks like a painting, with each object in the frame designed and textured flawlessly. It definitely shows how far we've come since Toy Story invented CGI animation back in 1995. It even looks better than the CGI used in many live action films, and that's saying something.Toy Story 4 is not the best of the series. A portion of the original characters aren't given very much to do throughout the runtime, in favour of focusing on the new ones. The villain, without spoiling anything, lacks the menacing characterisations of Sid, Stinky Pete and Lotso. This ultimately makes for a Toy Story instalment with something unheard of: a low-stakes storyline.Despite the script issues, this is a damn good sequel, and a nostalgic treat for those who grew up with these characters. It doesn't have the emotional weight and rich storytelling of its predecessor, but it makes up for that with pure popcorn entertainment.Woody at some point mentions that, 'You can teach an old toy new tricks.' When it comes to a third sequel, this is exactly what it sets out to do, and thankfully succeeds.",Null,1,3,22 June 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," If you thought an Avengers instalment without the helm of Joss Whedon would be concerning, don't worry. Infinity War is a blast that shows Marvel is still on top of their game
","Marvel has done the inconceivable. I'm happy to admit that Avengers: Infinity War is the best team up movie in the franchise since Joss Whedon's first Avengers film. But is that too much of a good thing? The answer is a resounding yes, but in a sense that it can be let loose and do whatever it wants while strictly aiming towards fans and non-fans. It's not perfect by any means, but for the most part it is like a vending machine loaded with colourful geekiness, going full throttle on humour, enthralling set pieces and surprising moments that still thrill. Even the third act is as satisfying and effective as anything we've seen before.The plot really kicks into gear from the get-go, not spending any time on setup and delving straight into the action. The past 18 instalments did the business of building everything up. Long story short, over 20 superheroes team up to take down the most powerful villain in the galaxy, Thanos (Josh Brolin). Rather than telling the story in predictable fashion, the script executes it unconventionally with splitting every character up into a different situation all over the place. Iron Man, Doctor Strange (the two Sherlock's: Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) team up, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) pairs up with the Guardians of the Galaxy, while Captain America (Chris Evans) reunites with his Civil War crew.What makes their interactions compelling is the commitment and energy that everyone involved brings to the film. Writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus structure scenes excellently, but the Russo brothers adapt them to the screen almost without a problem in sight. Where the duo's previous Marvel work were on the forefront of political seriousness, this time they channel the fanboy gleefulness that superhero films deserve, something that original director Joss Whedon had a knack for. They've just about matched him in terms of style.Thanos is engaging but not the bad-guy-wants-to-destroy-the-world stereotype that you could imagine. He's humanly developed and masterfully designed, but perhaps not as empathetic or relatable as Killmonger in Black Panther. As the plot roaringly progresses forward, so does he.This culmination doesn't always work. There is so much going on at once that sometimes you lose track of where you are and what's happening. The moments with underused characters frequently feel rushed, which makes scenes more appealing than others. Formulaic exposition can sometimes put the comedy to rest. But for a film as bulky as Infinity War, you can't have everything. It learns lessons from the frustrating overkill of subplots that plagued Age of Ultron and Civil War and goes for something leaner in its approach. More than a 'greatest hits' compilation, the film is the Pulp Fiction of the superhero genre. It is so good that it makes Justice League look like Batman and Robin.",8,3,6,4 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The force reawakens with a new hope in this solidly entertaining sequel that dares to go bold with the formula
","What was so surprising about The Force Awakens was how entertaining it really was. Sure, it offered overblown fan service and the story was nothing new, but it blended together old and new formula nicely with supreme energy.With The Last Jedi, those elements are shape shifted, creating a middle chapter that's difficult to compare with its predecessor. It takes what we think Star Wars is and sugarcoats it with a clean slate. This is all thanks to writer/director Rian Johnson, who plummets into warp speed to show this franchise what he's made of.The movie starts precisely where the original left off: Rey is handing Luke Skywalker his lightsaber on an island, Finn is in a coma, Kylo Ren is bent out of shape and Leia is fighting to end the good-vs-evil battle that the series became known for. That's pretty much the outline of the film, and it would be foolish to give away the rest. For your own safety, what you think will happen may or may not happen. You've been warned.The action scenes, locations and set design are all beautifully crafted, and are brought to life by the exuberance of John Boyega, Mark Hamil, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Issac and Adam Driver. Hamil playing Luke again proves that any actor over 60 can still have the talent that their younger selves would have lived in. He never tries to outsmart the youngsters, but instead has the time of his life like age doesn't matter. The new generation of actors are still on grand form and Carrie Fisher gives a wonderful final performance as Leia, implying that her legacy lives on in the franchise, no matter whether she's on or offscreen.The director adds some interesting ingredients to the table that haven't been explored before. The lightsaber and space battles clearly have Japanese and World War influences and interestingly expands on the focus of the force. For those familiar or new to the saga, these elements will no doubt surprise you at some point.But the force isn't always strong. A long scene involving a casino feels like footage that should have been left on the cutting room floor. It's fun, but adds nothing to what we already have. The pacing is frequently uneven as the story repeatedly jumps from one subplot to another. Also a few characters come off as either disappointingly one dimensional, underused or shoehorned in. But Johnson keeps the story barrelling along like a roller coaster ride, even if it's a touch too long at 152 minutes.The choices Johnson makes towards where the story goes would provoke polarising opinions, but he's not phantom menacing. It is perhaps the right time to reignite the formula before it becomes stale. It will be interesting to see how director J.J. Abrams takes these alterations forward with Episode IX.",8,1,3,3 January 2018
Toy Story 3," The perfect final chapter to a stunning trilogy!
","Toy Story 3 is a heart warming and laughable experience in every category that I think should be ranked as the title: The Best Animated Film In History. You'll laugh, you'll cry, then after you've watched it you'll be desperately going discuss or recommend it to friends wherever you go to see. There's a tiny bit of negative aspect in this film that effected me (it's only the cinematic experience not the home version). It was the ear splitting sound and 3D that was unpleasant for me. The 3D made no difference. NOTHING came out of the screen that was disappointing. Although the dialogue looked very good, it still hurt my eyes. Also a complaint about the sound. It was very loud and at the beginning of the film I had to put my hands over my ears. It was that loud. That all that was bad about it. Despite it's future references and new dialogue, it brings new characters and all new unexpected things to the franchise that gives you heart to the characters and feelings you've loved and known for past and years to come. When I first read the plot I thought (and what most people say) it was nothing different than to the first two. But when you watch it it makes some big and better differences to the scenes and animation. Director Lee Unkrich brings Toy Story to a extraordinary and exciting conclusion. Delivering an animation that's funny, amazing and sad in some places. It's worth going out to buy it from the DVD shop or off Amazon. This is truly the best, perfect and worthy finale to the franchise that brought computer animation to the big screen and made Pixar popular.",8,0,1,2 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A generous, energetic and brilliant return to a galaxy far, far away...
","For a starter, I'm not really a Star Wars fan. However, I enjoy the movies but now after seeing The Force Awakens, the way I look at the films has changed. I feel more familiar with the franchise than ever before. A feeling I haven't had with any other film released in 2015.Daisy Ridley plays Rey, a scavenger living in the Abu Dhabi-shot desert on the planet of Jakku. She one day finds a rollerball droid named BB-8 who she decides to keep. Meanwhile John Boyega's character Finn is a stormtrooper who exits his part in the evil First Order and runs into Rey and BB-8 and embark on a journey to fight against Adam Driver's post-Vador villain Kylo Ren. In the process they bump into an aged Han Solo and co, including a new character Poe Dameron played by another franchise newbie Oscar Isaac.Its great to have Han Solo and the rest of the old cast back and a grand welcome for two new leads, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, that have enough potential to kick start successful Hollywood acting careers thanks to this. Every performance is rewarding, big or small. Besides Ford, Ridley and Boyega completely steal the show. It's amazing how much talent they've got having not done anything much in Hollywood beforehand. Ford is the one to praise for bringing the nostalgic feeling from the original trilogy back onto it's feet. From the moment his 'Chewie we're home' line is said, the real Star Wars is back! It's a moment of magic.Director J.J. Abrams certainly had a risky task to take on board after the disappointing results of the prequels. He keeps on roots with the originals by using practical effects instead of CGI, real locations rather than green/blue screen and cute, caring creatures instead of another Jar Jar Binks. He knows how to blend old and fresh new ingredients together without ever losing interest in either of them. This is what many filmmakers fail to do. The old and fresh blood are entertaining anyway, almost like two movies merged into one.There are some flaws I feel though. After all the hype of Kylo Ren leading up to release, he results as a disappointing low key villain with nothing much special or original about him at all, besides the lightsaber. Driver is the wrong casting choice for the role. He's too young and looks less of a villain and more of a commercialised heartthrob. Even the First Order and it's characters feel underdeveloped without any logic to them whatsoever. Also Carrie Fisher's returning Princess Leia isn't the same person we saw last back in 1983. She's turned into a grandmotherly figure and although does a very good job at it, it is hard to see the character everybody once loved.Amongst these minor flaws, this is one heck of a Star Wars film. The action scenes from lightsabers to X-wing battles are endlessly exciting and John Williams' musical score has become mind-blowingly electrifying in the background. It's a joy to listen to. Abrams' cinematic return couldn't be more surprising. May the force be with him.",8,8,55,14 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," An excellent ending to one of the greatest film series in history!
","The legend ends. The excitement's largely thrilling. A motion picture of a generation... Part 2 is unlike any other final chapter or Harry Potter film ever made. It made a good finale by making it epic and larger. It's far better than part 1 and the action sequences are praisingly exciting.'Avengers Assemble' didn't need to beat it as the box office record that was the 3rd highest grossing film of all time but took this down a level lower because it shouldn't ridiculously be as successful as this. Although the 3D was an unpleasant experience David Yates(director) has the soul of an epic conclusion. An aspect of characters and relationships that return for the last time. Full of untold flashbacks and spellbinding visual effects, this film has to end with a big bang, laughter, excitement and sadness. Goodbye Harry Potter. You've changed cinema and enchanted the world for the last 10 years. We'll always remember from the beginning of his childhood to the death of evil he banquised.",8,1,3,24 June 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Brilliant, twisted, thrilling, funny, pleasantly enjoyable and agreeably entertaining. Matthew Vaughn strikes gold (again). He has a licence to thrill this time. A winner.
","We have got eight more months until we see Spectre, which we be Bond's next outing on the silver screen. If there in anything in these eight months that would entertain us while waiting, Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service is one of the closest to your calling.Five years ago, we got Kick-Ass, a spoof superhero movie that unleashed a new cinematic language. It was rather one of the most irresistibly entertaining films of the past few years. It's ultra-violent structure and bar-over-topping scale of profanity and humour proved that director Vaughn could be a genius at this stuff. The plot focuses on a teenager who decides to become a superhero. Basically for me, even though it isn't one of my favourite films of all time, the film feels like an instant classic.Newcomer Taron Egerton plays Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin, a cockney teen from London. Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is a secret agent who works for Kingsman (a secret spy service similar to MI6) on a 'Diagon Alley', like London street. He finds 'Eggsy' and recruits him to stop an evil mastermind, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). He wants to take over the world with an evil plan (the typical baddie plot, hey?). But before doing so, he needs to complete in a few life-risking tasks with other opponents (sounds familiar to you? Hunger Games? Divergent? Yes, most of the young adult books seem the same these days. Don't you agree?).Mark Strong and Michael Caine play supporting roles alongside Firth in the service. Even Star Wars' Mark Hamill pops up (as a professor, not a Jedi in case you were wondering...) and clearly and obviously, at 63, looks different to how he looked four decades ago. Let's see how he revisits as Luke again in 'The Force Awakens' this December.The jokes arrive agreeably but not as quickly as I was expecting. The film deals with themes such as dysfunction families and bullying. These are serious issues so some ways it has a more mature nature than Vaughn's previous film (Kick-Ass). Vaughn's tone hasn't changed which is a relief. Even if it takes time to register, it's pretty funny stuff. Vaughn and his co-writer Jane Goldman also throw in Bond references as well which add to the fun. The lacking of ultra-violence is really the only disappointment. There's an overlong entertaining church fight sequence, and the climax at the finale is overblown (probably one of the biggest key references to Bond throughout the whole film). There's also a noticeably clichéd but really fun pub battle. Other than these, there's not a huge amount of action.You can't help thinking that it might be a mirror image of Vaughn's previous film as it's done by the same director and writers. But after a while, you get used to the different structure of the film itself.Could Vaughn be an expert at spy movies? I can't answer this. It's a question only for you to answer. Myself, I consider it to be perhaps the best and most clever spy spoof since the Johnny English films. So my answer would be that he would not entirely be an expert at spy movies but one at these style of spoofs. Having done a superhero spoof in 2010 and a spy spoof in 2015, we'll have to see what handle he'll give us in another five years.",8,6,15,9 February 2015
