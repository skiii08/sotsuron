Skyfall," Amazing
","After seeing this movie, I was a little confused. What I saw was one of the best movies I have ever seen. On the other hand, I was about to cry. Because this is, in my opinion, the 2nd James Bond movie that had little in common with our beloved British spy.The DB5 from Goldfinger, Q and all the little references to previous movies, triggered that lovely 'I'm watching a Bond movie'-feeling (and touch√© for bringing back those funny catchy James Bond reactions in the dialogs, I missed those in QoS and Casino Royale). The DB5 and the other references totally mess with the reboot idea, but I'll get over it and so will you.But what about villains that want world domination? Why for god's sake suddenly involve M into a personal vendetta? And what about the Bond girls? Those couple of minutes of Severine didn't do for me. Like I said, I was confused. On one hand you have all these iconic 007 elements. On the other, it is nowhere near a Bond story. I feel like this is a missed opportunity.About the score... it didn't feel punchy enough to be Bond, I wasn't impressed.But, we're here to judge the movie, not whether it's Bond or no Bond. I'm gonna give it a 8.5. Dynamic story, great directing, phenomenal acting, good action... it's all there. This is definitely a must-see. But for 'Bondness'? A 5/10. (but don't let that keep you from watching it.)For hardcore Bond fans: it might be a tiny bit disappointing (especially the story)... but the DB5, the references to previous movies,... And once you see the final scene; boy, does that feel like homecoming. It's a great way of celebrating 50 years of Bond, and it looks promising for Bond 24.",8,5,13,28 October 2012
