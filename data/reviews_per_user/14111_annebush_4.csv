The Avengers," So much better than the winter soldier!
","People think that the Winter Soldier is better than the Avengers. So what? I do and always will think that the Avengers is the best superhero movie of all time. I watch it over and over again, but I never ever get tired of it! This movie is absolutely one of the best, especially with Robert Downey Jr. He makes it seem that this movie is a comedy! I laughed so hard the first time that I almost cried. I especially liked it when Dr. Banner turned into Hulk and was shot by an airplane. The bullets didn't do anything, and the pilot kept saying, 'Target angry!' I also laughed when Hulk went flying off the airplane. Thor was so dramatic, but I could totally see where he was coming from. You kind of want to throw a hissy fit when your own brother is trying to destroy Earth. Wow, the fighting scene was actually interesting and had a point to it, unlike the Winter Soldier. I explained that in my review for the Winter Soldier. Definitely not as good as the Avengers. If you have not seen this movie, watch it right now!",10,2,5,15 April 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," CAPTAIN America: Don't listen to the critics!
","I will come right out and say that the critics who said this was better than the avengers were dead WRONG. The three main sins of captain America: The winter soldier are 1: There are SO MANY POINTLESS FIGHTING SCENES!! 2. THOSE FIGHTING SCENES GO ON UNTIL THE END OF TIME!! 3. I'm not a hater of old' Cap, but he should have died like, 100 times. And oops! I forgot one, but I'm not sure if it's just me. The story is SO predictable. I could totally tell that Bucky the Winter Soldier would eventually save Captain America from a watery grave. Speaking of, Captain A. Got about five shots in his stomach, got punched multiple times, fell from probably two thousand feet into icy cold water, yet he still lives. So realistic. Also, we see Captain fall off and the Winter Soldier still hanging on to the airship, but about a minute later we see him drag Captain to shore. How could he have found him? And how could he have jumped off a minute later, but still be at or near the site where Captain fell? Those are the cons. The few pros are 1. There are a few funny lines that made everyone crack up. 2. It has a good back-story to it. 3. there are many breathtaking moments. So, overall, we have a film that has a not-too-shabby story to it with too many pointless fighting scenes with a few funny lines and a predictable conclusion, and a film that is definitely NOT better than the Avengers and NOT what the critics claim it is.",5,18,34,13 April 2014
Frozen," left me speechless.
","Wow. Just wow. I remember the first time I saw Frozen. It was breathtaking! I loved everything about it. It had an amazing cast, funny characters, a great moral, outstanding animations and soundtrack. What more could you ask for? Nothing is perfect, and Frozen had its mere flaws, but overall this is right up there with the Lion King. FINALLY, Disney realized you cannot marry a man you just met. It's about time. Olaf was hilarious, Anna was uplifting, Elsa was breathtaking. I just do not understand how people do not like this! It finally focuses on a sisterhood, not a prince charming. Girls are tough too. In this movie, neither Anna or Elsa are the damsels in distress. Watch it, watch it, watch it!!!",10,5,15,15 April 2014
Pocahontas," awesome movie!
","I cannot believe people fuss over this movie. To me, it's just about perfect! Yes, Pocahontas did not just 'learn' English like 'that', but guess what? This movie is meant to uplift little girls, not to educate them! It's inspirational, that's what. Even though it still has that princess romance, like, a lost,this is a great movie! To all the people who say its like, SO fake and fictional, darn am I disappointed in you! This movie is very loosely based on a historical event. No, John S. an Pocahontas never had romance of any sort, but this is still one of the best princess movies and at least should be a 8.3. This is and always will be one of those underrated Disney gems for the ages.",9,2,5,15 April 2014
