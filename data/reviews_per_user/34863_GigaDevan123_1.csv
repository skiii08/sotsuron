Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sky-High Expectations From The Masses Pretty Much Killed This Very Good Film...
","It was in the first half of 1999. The whole world is excited about the long awaited prequel to the Star Wars saga, 3 landmark films. Everyone's expectations were huge. Everyone who knew about this movie was expecting something of a perfect film. No film could ever meet that expectation. Ever.Finally, the film comes out. Much to everyone's surprise, anyone who wasn't a star wars fan said it was horrible. 'Star Wars has lost its force' said one film reviewer. More and more people said the film was a let down. Some people just didnt see the film because of what other people said.So, when I finally see the film, after having heard all of the put downs for the film, my expectations weren't very high. I was expecting a B-grade movie with nice action scenes. When the film was over, though, I was pleasantly suprised. It was actually a pretty good movie. I believe the reason that people said the movie was a let down was because the Star Wars franchise was bordering on legendary - something that could not be matched. People kept expecting the movie to top its predecessor, and by doing that, when the movie didn't, they unfairly judged the movie.Now, during the movie, if you look past the Star Wars franchise, the movie is a Very good Stand Alone Title. The film has flaws, though.  Some of the acting is sub-par, especially Anakin's friends.Jar Jar Binks can also be very annoying, and the movie relies too heavily on special effects.But even with these flaws, Phantom Menace is a good movie, but I would not recommend buying it, unless you are a Star Wars fan. Watch it in the theatre then rent the DVD with special features. You will not be let down.So, all in all, Phantom Menace was killed because the expectations were way too high. But, if you can give the film a chance as a stand-alone, you will probably like it.8.0/10",Null,1,2,15 July 2003
