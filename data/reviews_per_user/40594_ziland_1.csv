Iron Man 3," Meh...
","I wish there was a big SPOILER warning at the beginning of this movie, so I'll do one here.If you loved the first two, and the Avengers, and, pretty much any Marvel movies, then do yourself a BIG favor and skip over this one, it'll leave you feeling cheated and you'll have a feeling of bubbling anger deep within you that you can't seem to remove other than by trying to warn others away from this awful movie (as I'm doing now...)I don't even know if I ought to keep any hopes for the new Thor movie and the avengers 2 anymore, I used to be so happy just seeing that Marvel intro at the start of movies, as it used to guarantee I would get at least an hour and a half or two hours of quality entertainment, but now, my faith is shattered, no words can really describe this feeling properly, other than the feeling you might get, coming home and finding someone in bed with your wife/husband, your kids dead and all you've ever owned destroyed, that feeling would be just about 100 times worse than what I feel right now, but it's in the same vein. :PIf people require spoiler warning for reviews, I sure as hell would love that the entertainment industry did us that courtesy also...As far as I'm concerned, this series ended at Iron Man 2.PS: This is my first review, hopefully my last, here's to hoping no Marvel movie will ever be this bad again...",1,14,31,23 May 2013
