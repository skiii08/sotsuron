The Blair Witch Project," Not bad...
","Can't say I didn't enjoy it but I don't consider it on par with the Exorcist, much less scarier.  Best part was the documentary style, it completely reinvented lots of horror standards: the woods; random, distant sounds in the dark; hearing voices; the spooky house; the unseen antagonist. These have been used to the point of cliche but, alter the style, they have substance again!   Kudos to the cast and crew for that.  The marketing of this film was slick, especially the borderline War-of-the Worlds style implication that this was a true story. As for the hype, it's unfortunate but you do what ya gotta do to break through the monopoly of big-budget pictures.  In that respect Blair Witch was a guerilla triumph.",Null,0,1,7 March 2000
Alien," The best in Science Fiction films
","This is realistic Science Fiction; arguing about bonus shares over coffee and cigarettes in space.  If we start mining asteroids the people who go out there and do it will probably be like the characters from this movie.  It's not only terrifying it's realistic. We don't see a polished, gleaming spaceship we see a giant factory complete with dripping water, chains, equipment scattered here and there.  It's human progress like we know it, good but not always pretty.  And the Alien spaceship was incredible, especially since the movie didn't bend over backwards trying to explain it. You're left to speculate.Some of the best scenes:The Alien ship:  Dallas looking into the eye of the Alien Captain, turning away, and the camera focusing on the skull for a second in the darkness. Chilling.The Dinner scene:  One of the top-ten sci-fi moments.The conversations of Parker and Brett:   How the interstellar laborer views management.  Way to develop the characters.Brett looking for Jones:  ScaryDallas in the shafts:  Even scarier, especially with the music.Ripley and the alien:  'Nuff said.",Null,0,1,3 March 2000
The Truman Show," Very blunt satire
","Very polite, VERY VERY pretentious, the religious overtones way too obvious (Christof? A voice in the sky?) and successful because there was nothing better to fill it's niche- copyright suit notwithstanding.  The whole point of satire is to have a little bite, like American Beauty, Natural Born Killers, even Cable Guy just to name a few.  TTS had no bite at all, more of a light gumming on the media's wrist, which is something the media actually likes- sort of a Friar's Club Roast situation.  The media candidly acknowledges the low level of quality in their product and makes very lame attempts to cover it up.   The Real Worlders, and the people who watch them, know the show is cut, chopped and edited into something very far removed from what they experienced.  And the argument that we as a society watch too much TV has been around from the day TV was mass-produced.  The Truman Show doesn't make the media shake it makes them nod their heads like, 'Yep, we're that bad.  And if we had the resources at our disposal, we'd do something like The Truman Show if we gave them enough reason to tune in.'  That said, The Truman Show really isn't satire at all, just a copy of a copy with an expensive set to mitigate this fact.",Null,1,2,11 September 2000
