Raiders of the Lost Ark," The best 80's film
",All movies from Steven Spielberg are my favorites. Gremlins 1&2 are great. The Goonies are amazing. The Jurassic park films I can't get enough from. His war movies are so well made. Back to the future and go one with his movies. But the Indiana movies are for sure my number one movies from Steven Spielberg. The movie is full with good special effect. Good story lines. And the acting is perfect with this cast. Tonight I'm going to watch all 4 off them. A whole weekend long. And enjoy all of them 5 stars my number one is of course Raiders of the lost ark. The special effects in this movie are so well made by Steven Spielberg,8,0,0,29 April 2016
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 5 stars
",What can i say about this movie. I watch this movie 10 times. And I still love to watch it. It a good action movie with Arnold on his best. Going to watch it tonight again. The special effects are good. I hope many more of this films will come in the next further. part one wash great but part two is my favorite. Also the attraction in universal studios is amazing. It's is so cool that it really feels like you're in the movie. Terminator 2 gets 5 stars from me! For the best action senses from the 90's so many bullets I have never seen and I watched a lot of action movies. Arnold made a lot off good action movies. But he will always be my terminator.,9,1,2,29 April 2016
