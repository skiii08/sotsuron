The Blair Witch Project," Scary scary and brilliant
","The Blair Witch Project is one of the greatest films i've ever seen.  This movie makes you feel like you are wandering lost in the forest along side the characters.  The fact that there was never a sighting of a ghost or any typical horror film -scary element-, made the movie more terrifying. If you're expecting to see a gory, monster filled, blood squirting, cat jumping from behind the door horror film, then don't bother seeing this movie.  You will be disappointed. However, if you can appreciate a brilliant concept, brilliant acting and psychological suspense, go go go tonite to see the blair witch project!",10,2,3,1 August 1999
