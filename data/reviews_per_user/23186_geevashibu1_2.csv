Requiem for a Dream," Amazingly dope
",Requiem for a Dream is like the most thought provoking stoner movie ever! Its a bizarre and heavy movie that is quite different from any other stoner movie.The psychological thriller directed by Darren Aranofsky absolutely ripped us all throughout the film with its cutting edge sequences and a stunning climax.The movie goes complicatedly into the lives of four people who renders themselves into drugs.The director made it so simple a complicated movie that had one of the most ominous climax for such a type of movie. The movie goes up from a controllable normal situation into a rebellious second half with a great impact on its characters.The movie has some intense scenes sometimes disturbing but some of the shots were rapid and innovative for a film of this genre.The movie mixes up some contrasting situation of people that eventually comes together into the same path at end. The direction has been pure class. Aranofsky excelled in his work with his clear cut sequences and directing the movie at the right pace.The cast selection was apt and almost everyone showed top class acting especially Ellen Burstyn. Her character was one of the most intriguing and major in the movie.Jared Leto just showed how good an actor he is as well as Jennifer Connelly. The BGM throughout the film were cool and intense.All in all the movie looked tough and is one to watch if you are a movie fanatic.,8,1,2,20 February 2017
Love Actually," Love actually review
","The movie is one of the films that makes you really happy.As the title suggests,the movie deals with lives of different people with different backgrounds who fall in love and shows the effect on their lives.The movie is crafted beautifully combining these lives together providing the viewers a happy time.Moreover this movie makes us smile throughout with the emotions that relates with love hence providing a soothing feeling.The script work is of high standards and the direction should also be appreciated.The movie cherishes and restricts it plot the happy side of love rather than going deep into the characters' lives.Eventually it turns out to be a calm and joyful movie that creates a happy impression to the viewers.",10,1,2,31 December 2016
