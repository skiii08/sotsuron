The Blair Witch Project," #1 horror movies of the 90s
","I don't understand a lot of people.C'mon.Blair witch is atmospheric,without blood or sex,original,new concept,scary.All that plus you got good acting and a great background story.I don't mind about all the internet publicity.If you like bad horror movies like all the teeny slashers like 'Scream,I know bla bla bla last summer'...good for you, but don't say that 'The Blair witch project' is not good because it's not a real story or another brainless argument!10/10simply brilliant!Get this one on DVD!!!",10,2,3,13 July 2000
Top Secret!," One of the funniest comedy ever!
","This is my favorite comedy ever.It's one of those movies that you get never tired of it.Jokes never stops,from the start till the end it's so dawn funny.And Val Killmer is perfect as the Americain 50s hero guy.Watch this at night and you will laugh you heart out!",10,0,1,24 July 2000
The Shining," A masterpiece

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A good James Cameron film?

Being John Malkovich," One of a kind!

Brilliant! 10/10",10,0,1,23 August 2000
The Exorcist," Best Horror Film...period
","No other movie capture the essence of horror like 'The Exorcist' does it.The atmosphere,the directing, everything is very complex.Those of you laugh hard when you saw it just don't know anything about movie-making.Scary and intelligent at the same time does not happen to often so get out of your house and go rent THE EXORCIST another time before  you get possessed.",10,0,1,18 July 2000
Coyote Ugly," Pointless and Stupid
","This movie is a bag of bad cliche with bad actors,a bad script and a bad director.Everything in Coyote Ugly is trash.I can't believe I spend money to see this.I thought that maybe it would some kind of a b-movies you like to hate, but no.I hate this movie, period.Pointless and boring.DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!",1,5,10,6 August 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Best Science-Fiction Film!
","No words can describe this movie.First of all, it is the greatest sci-fi flick of all time.And yes,it's better than 'Star Wars'.It is a countdown to tomorrow, a road map to human destiny, a quest for the infinite.A compelling drama of man vs machine, a stunning meld of music and motion.Kubrick's best!Watch this one alone not at a party or something!My favorite.10/10Kubrick is GOD!",10,1,4,31 July 2000
It's a Wonderful Life," So pure!
","How can anyone describe the magic, the purity, the emotions that this movie have.It is impossible.Capra must have been real proud of this one.'It's a wonderful life' was and will be always be one the few movies that have a place in my heart.And I'm not the only one.A magical movie to see over and over again!Simply Perfect!",10,0,3,31 July 2000
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A great film
","Good actors,good director and a a good story can only be a super great flick.Winona Ryder is awesome in the role of Mina and what about Gary oldman.....awesome.It's like a hammer movie but with bigger budgets.Simply fantastic!",10,1,3,18 July 2000
Blade Runner," Second Best Sci-fi movie of all time

A Nightmare on Elm Street," Original and scary!
",My first horror movie.I remember seing this at a family party late  at night.  I coudn't sleep for days.Freddy Krueger in that film is scary and dangerous.In all of the sequels he's some kind of goofy and it turns out to be comedy more than horror.But this one is terrific.A must to see for any horror fan out there.,10,0,0,14 July 2000
The Wizard of Oz," The Greatest Fantasy Movie!
","This is the greatest movie of the 30s.But also of the first half of the 20th century.once you've seen it, you will never be the same.It will touch a part of yourself that you think is dead...your childhood.It is so magical.Words can't not describe this flick.You have to see it to understand.Generations and generations have felt the magic of the great wizard of oz.Judy Garland is the best and this movie is the best.Watch this one a thousand times and remember....THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME:)",10,1,2,18 July 2000
