Requiem for a Dream," I found Requiem to be the most powerful, intuitive movie I have ever seen.
","Darren Aronofsky has created a masterpiece in Requiem for a Dream.  It's combination of artful cinematography and powerful imagery, as well as plot, combine to make this the singularly most affective and moving film of the drug genre.  Following such predecessors as Drugstore Cowboy and Trainspotting, Requiem surpasses them all in its grim portrayal of the downward spiral of the drug culture, and wrenches the audience through an emotional roller-coaster that will keep them talking for days.  Never has any movie had such a lasting affect as that of Requiem.  Warning - This is not a movie for the light-at-heart.  This movie portrays every grim aspect of a reality we are all to easy to forget exists.  It is a movie everyone should see, but not many can handle.  Ellen Burstyn leaves a performance for the ages.  I highly recommend this title to anyone that has ever considered the use of drugs.  You will never be the same again.",10,0,0,26 March 2001
