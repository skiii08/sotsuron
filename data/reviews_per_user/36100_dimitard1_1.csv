The Rock," The best movie ever
","This is the best movie, i've even seen. Great director, great actors and great story. This is the only movie, where the support acting is equal to the main one. Michael Bay is my favourite director and this is the movie, that showed me that he is a genius. The way the camera moves in his movies is unique. Every scene of this movie is nifty. The beginning of 'The Rock' takes my breath away every time I watch it. After that I see only great acting and great directing. This movie has even some funny moments, which raise more its quality.Similar movies are 'Con Air' and 'Face Off', but 'The Rock' is better than them, because they don't have Machael Bay as a director. He is the best action director. The rest of his movies ( 'Bad Boys 1&2', 'Armageddon', 'Pearl Harbor', 'The Island' and the newest one 'Transformers' ) prove that.",10,2,3,6 September 2007
