10 Cloverfield Lane," Who is lying?
",A great claustrophobic mystery. Who is lying? What's going on? Is it a clue or a red herring? Someone it going to die but who? Great story and acting.,9,0,0,9 May 2020
Edge of Tomorrow," Great Action SF
",I didn't read the synopsis and thus was surprised by the twist at the very beginning. The action is frantic and very well done. I thought the CGI were excellent. One plot hole (personal details) Some dialogue was indistinct and no subtitles on NowTV.,9,0,0,21 September 2019
