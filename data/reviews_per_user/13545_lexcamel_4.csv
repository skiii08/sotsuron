Baby Driver," EXCITING MOVIE!
","It's been a long time since I watched such a GOOD movie!
The soundtrack is frighteningly perfect! The sound job is WONDERFUL!
There are no political speeches, leftist ideology and much less moral speech!
I am very sad for films of this type, little by little stop being produced to make way for 'EMPTY SPEECHES' of the industry that only thinks about profiting from the social 'disgrace' ....",8,0,0,2 July 2020
1917," MAGNIFICENT!
","Exceptional work! WONDERFUL!The work with the camera is surprising, sometimes it causes us despair in not being able to understand how certain scenes were made.
History is breathtaking, there is no time to breathe, you get involved in a way that has probably never been experienced.
It is a simple tale, without political ideology, leftism or any other influence ...SENSATIONAL!",9,0,1,6 May 2020
