The Ring," Great movie, not so great ending
","Well for those of you who were thinking you were gonna watch a scary movie, your wrong.  It does however keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time.  The only part that I didn't like was the ending.  It leaves you with the big question, WHY?????  They never really tell you why things happend the way they did and that was a little upsetting.  Still a great movie and one of the best films of the year.",9,1,2,16 January 2003
Blow," Nothing about this movie was bad.
","Blow is the best movie I've seen so far this year and it will be hard to beat.  They to you so in depth about this man's life I actually felt what he was feeling. Great movie, a must see for all.  It takes you from Mr. Jung never wanting to be poor, to having all the money he could ever want but losing the person(his daughter) he promised he would leave.  On a scale 1-10, I give it a 10+.",10,0,0,29 May 2001
