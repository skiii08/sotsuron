Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Good Prequel
","Introduction:The Phantom Menace is a good movie. I'm not afraid to say it. I think it's a good movie. I believe the criticisms against this film, are invalid. They should be reevaluated. And like many, I use to hate the film, and be another sheep. But upon thinking it over, thinking about the problems with the film, and the criticisms that I knew were weak or hypocritical: and I came to the conclusion that the Phantom Menace is a good movie. It's probably my least favorite prequel, but I still enjoy it. The Phantom Menace is a criminally underrated movie, that gets unnecessary amounts of hate.Defense:Common criticism and complaints against the Phantom Menace include, a bad script, bad acting, too much needless CGI, and Jar Jar Binks. I believe all these criticisms are ridiculous and invalid.1. Bad ScriptThe supposed horrible script is not amazing, but it's certainly not terrible. Many complain that the film contradicts the original trilogy, with mediclorians. As according to the film, they are the force. Which is not true. They are a way of measuring the force. They are not the force itself. So it doesn't contradict what Yoda said. Or many might complain that it removes the fantasy elements from the films. No it doesn't, because the organisms are not the force itself. And even if it does, so what? I don't see the problem. Look at this film's IMDb page, and look at the genres, it is labeled as a fantasy film.But that's not what people complain most about, it's the badly written characters, or the fact the film doesn't a center character. But are they badly written? I would say no. And I believe the center characters are Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, it can have two. I will discuss all the characters, and explain how they are written fine.Qui-Jon is a Jedi master who doesn't fully believe in the Jedi Code, an important part of this trilogy. He is not a slave of the Jedi teachings, and can often disagree with them. Obi-Wan is very different from that, he is a little more devoted to the Jedi teachings. Anakin is a hopeful little slave boy, who has a dark future ahead of him. And many might complain about the choice to make Anakin 9 years old. But George Lucas, who created Star Wars, as creator has the freedom to do what he wants. And can really only be criticized in this field if he contradicts himself, which he doesn't do. Padme, even though he puts up a bland and emotionless exterior, shows more emotion, when she's not performing her duties as Queen.Darth Sidious is the dark puppet-master of the films events. Manipulating the characters, and planning bigger things for the future. Darth Maul is his emotionless assassin, who hunts down and kills who he's told to, without mercy. So I never got this argument.Also, many complain that the characters aren't focused on enough. But, if it was a character driven story, it is a valid criticism. But it's not, it's a setting driven story. As they go from location to location. And galactic politics mostly drives the story. So the characters are focused on enough for this kind of story.So, the criticism of the writing has been debunked.2. Bad ActingThe supposed bad acting in this film is another criticism I don't understand. If this was any other film, it would be bad. But in the context of the film, the performances make sense. The Jedi are established as emotionless, and as I mentioned before, when Padme was being the Queen of Naboo, she would put on a bland exterior. But when not performing her queenly duties, she was quite a fun person.And the acting of Jake Lloyd wasn't terrible, as he acted like a real child. And the chemistry he had with the actor playing his mother was very convincing.I think the claim that the film has bad acting needs to be better thought out. Because the way this film is written, the acting serves it's intended purpose, and is bland by design.3. Needless CGIPeople complain that the effects and CGI is overdone and unnecessary. Well, what if I told you the criticism is invalid? And that the film the has more practical effects than CGI? The film has real sets, real props, and real models. The Naboo Palace was a set that was built. Many of the ships they fly in were real models and actual sets. And many of the pod-racers were actual models built. And well yes, there is CGI. That shouldn't be criticized.At the time it looked amazing. Jar Jar Binks, love him or hate him, was the first fully CGI character. Which should be commended not condemned. How come when somebody revolutionizes film making, they are praised, someone like Dziga Vertov, who pioneered many filming techniques in the 1920's, technique still used today? But when George Lucas does something arguably more inventive, he's hated? It's hypocrisy!4. Jar Jar BinksNow here's the elephant in the room, Jar Jar Binks is a terrible character. And I agree with this one, mostly. Many claim Jar Jar is pointless, and doesn't add anything. And you can hate this characters all you want, I'm that big a fan of him. If you don't like a character, that's fine. My issue the fact that many claim he's pointless. When he isn't, if our heroes didn't come across him, how would they get to the Gungan City. They didn't know where it was. But no, pointless. He also serves the purpose of being comedy relief. Something C-3PO and R2-D2 did, and personally, I wan't a fan of them either. Jar Jar Binks is fine, and so is R2 and 3PO.Conclusion:After debunking all that criticism, is your mind changed? If not, that's fine. Your opinion is your's to have. And I shouldn't force you to like something. The film is not 100% perfect, but it's not deserving of hate. If you upon reevaluation still hate the movie, I don't feel the need to force my opinion on you.",6,1,2,30 June 2019
The Sound of Music," A Little Overrated...
","'The Sound of Music' is a solid film. A good 6/10. Not deserving of a 8/10 on this cite or really that much praise. Now, you may ask - 'What's my problem with the film?' Well, if you ask me, the film could've been shorter. I think film's three-hour run-time really hinders it, and causes it to loose a lot of it's momentum it had in the beginning. The film does have good songs and descent sets, it's just it's at point, a bit of a snooze fest. And honestly, with another movie, I would have more to say, but this film really doesn't have me discussing it very long.",6,0,4,26 July 2019
Spartacus," A Kubrick Masterpiece
","Intro:Stanley Kubrick is one of the best filmmakers to ever live. And one of his films goes by the title of Spartacus. This amazing 3 hour epic that details the slave rebellion Spartacus lead, is entertaining from start to finish. Feeling surprisingly short for a 3 hour film. It's basically a masterpiece in every way.The Good:The film's story chronicles the rebellion of Spartacus. As he finds love, and we see it from the sides of the Roman Government and the Slave Rebellion. And this film is epic in feeling, with lots of style, but also good writing to back it up. From the character of Spartacus, really well adapted from the book, and while much is fictionalized, that doesn't mean it isn't well written. We also see the harsh reality of slave life in the Roman Republic. And we see the build up to the rebellion, as we watch, waiting for it to happen. The film also looks spectacular and the musical score is really well done. With sets that are very well built. That also look historically accurate, and gives the film an epic feel and scale. However, that doesn't mean it's flawlessThe Bad:However, I can still find issues, as I think the romance between Spartacus and Varinia is rushed. They fall in love instantly. And some of the acting isn't very good. I remember when I watched the film in 8th grade Social Studies, one delivery was so funny, that the teacher re-winded it, because it was so unintentionally funny. And maybe that's just old school acting, but I think I can tell the difference between old-school acting, and good acting.Conclusion:Even with the issues, Spartacus is still a movie that works really well. Stanley Kubrick is masterful in his directing. The film feels epic, having elements of tragedy in it that I love, the sets are nice, most of the acting is good, and it's simply a classic. It may have some issues, but I still love this film, it was also a little ahead of it's time. And this is easily one of the best works of Stanley Kubrick, and a great piece of history on film.",8,1,2,2 July 2019
The Death of Stalin," A Good Historical Film, and a Good Comedy!
","'The Death of Stalin' is a 2017 comedy about, what else, the death of Joseph Stalin. As well as the events that proceeded the dictator's death. It's a surprisingly accurate historical that doesn't overstay it's welcome, and adds a nice level of comedy to this important event in history.To start, the movie has hilarious character interactions, and laugh out loud moments. While still respecting history, and the people involved in the history. The film follows the power struggle after Stalin's death, and shines light on the ridiculousness of the true story. Whileost historical films are very serious in their approach, it's refreshing to see a film that saterizes history, and the funny things that actually happened.One thing that always makes me laugh is when Stalin suffers the stroke that ended his life. Two guards were standing outside of the room, and heard suspicious activity. But they too afraid to go inside, because Stalin didn't want to be disturbed, and the two feared being killed if they went inside. And this is 100% true, making it all the funnier. And there are so many other examples of the amazing comedy.To cut it short, 'The Death of Stalin' is one of the best comedies of all time, and maybe even one of my favorite movies. I highly recommend this one, and think it deserves a higher rating.",8,3,4,6 August 2019
Beauty and the Beast," The Best Disney Movie Ever!
","Introduction:If you ask most people, their favorite Disney film is 'The Lion King'. Well, my favorite is 'Beauty and the Beast'. Because it was really my introduction to this company. And for a kids film, it has what is still one of the best romances in film history.The Story & Characters:The story of Beauty and the Beast is based on a fairy tale that follows a girl named, Belle. Who turns herself in as a prisoner of the Beast. After her father stumbles upon and angers him.And both the Beast and Belle are two of the best characters to come out of Disney. The Beast is a man who feels great rage and pain, and is kind of an outcast, after being turned into a monster, however, under all of that anger lies a good, kind person. And Belle sees that, as she is a bit of an outcast herself, very different from everyone else in her town. Exemplified by the fact that she's the only one that wears the color blue.And steadily, over the course of the film, grow closer to each other, the film taking it's time, and never rushing. This is one of the best romances in movie history.Gaston is also a descent villain, as he wants to marry Belle, because she is the most beautiful woman in town. And it would help his inflated ego. He also has a great song.And for that matter, all the songs are great, from 'Be Our Guest', to 'Gaston', to 'Beauty and the Beast', all the songs are memorable and help in telling the narrative a creative way.My only issue is some of the world building that doesn't add up. The pots and pans that are alive, really raise a lot of weird questions. Like, 'If one of the tea cups is eight years old, and the curse lasted 10 years, how was he born?' and other questions like that. It's not a big issue, and it's a fairy tale after all, so I really don't care. However, even with that small issue, I think this is the best fairy tale adaptation of all time.The Animation:Beautiful, the way that they are able to animate the expression on their faces, and the way the world is animated so well. The colors pop off the screen, and every frame of this film looks so beautiful is drawn so well. And while it may look like average Disney animation. It's still damn good animation.Conclusion:This is an excellent movie. Easily the best of Disney animation, and without a doubt one of my top 3 favorite animated pictures. Great romance, great drama, great animation, and a great film. What else can I say? It's a classic, it more than deserved it's Best Picture nomination, and more than deserving of all kinds of praise.",10,2,2,1 July 2019
Spider-Man 2," Superhero Masterpiece
","Introduction:I love this movie. And the Raimi trilogy as a whole. They are truly up there with the Dark Knight or Lord of the Rings trilogies. And Spider-Man 2 is, no surprise, the best in that trilogy.Why I Love It:I really like the writing of this movie. The world is just as vibrant as it was in the first movie. The writing is just as perfect as it was in the first movie. And characters are even better than in the first.This movie creates the perfect film protagonist, in the form of Peter Parker. And it's not for the performance, or the writing of the character, but how the story drives the character. Now, what do I mean by that? Well I mean, the fact that he gets beaten on and treated terribly by everyone in the movie.Starting with him getting fired from his job, throughout the film he is yelled at, bur-rated, looses his powers, and is put under incredible stress. But, by the end of the film, he is able to leap above his problems. And become a better person.I wasn't a huge fan of Mary Jane in the film. But the romance between them is heavily improved in this film. As she starts out by dating another guy because Peter rejected her, it was simply out if spite, but by the end of the film, she learns from that.The story of Harry Osborn is also expanded upon, as he feels a need for revenge on Spider-Man, after the death of his father. As we see him on a verge of transforming into something he's not. Being consumed by revenge.Aunt May is one of my favorite characters in this franchise, truly feeling like a sort of parental figure. And she feels like a real parent. And acts like a real person. Like in the scene where Peter tells her that he was partly responsible for Uncle Ben's death. And instead of instantly forgiving him, she leaves. Which is more like the reaction of a real person.The villain of the film, Doctor Octopus, was also pretty interesting. Starting out as a smart scientist and good-hearted person. He's turned into an evil super villain, by an experiment gone wrong, being controlled by his technology, he goes on a crusade to finish the experiment he started. And it's very interesting to watch his fall from Grace, and eventual redemption.I would like talk the action scenes in this film. Such as, the famous train scene, even though the effects are not as amazing as they were back then. The scene is still an adrenaline rush, by the end of the scene, I feel like I need a brake.I would also like to talk about a specific scene. The cake scene. Easily, one of the best scenes of the film. As throughout the film, Peter was getting dumped on, no one treated him with respect, or supported him through his issues. However, when the landlord's daughter, offers him cake, someone finally did something nice for him. And this little act of kindness, goes a long way.I also enjoyed the effects, while dated, for the time, they were amazing. And won the film an Oscar. And the film has the same Sam Raimi flare. With bright colors and vibrant locations that really make it look like a comic book.Conclusion:I love the movie. And it's a true masterpiece of the superhero genre. It's entertaining, the characters are great, the story is great, everything is great. It's a film I have a hard time finding flaws with, and a film I will always rewatch.",9,3,7,30 June 2019
Alexander," Alexander: A Really Disappointing Missed Oppertunity
","Oliver Stone's 'Alexander' chronicles the life of the interesting Macedonian general, Alexander the Great. The movie really had potential, it has amazing visuals, and stays accurate to history. But the film is so bad. It's boring, badly acted, and just embarrassing.Now, the movie almost three hours, and while I usually don't mind a long runtime. The film really feels like a drag at points, but what really makes this film bad, is the acting. It's beyond terrible. This movie's version of drama is yelling at each other. And it feels like a crappy stage-play, or a silent film with sound. As in a play, the actors have to scream so the audience can hear them, but this is a movie, so that's not an issue. And with a silent film, there was no luxory of sound to fully express the actors, but this movie isn't silent, so again, not an issue.I can praise the film's attention to detail. The action is incredible, and the film is a beautiful spectacle, and it's clear that the film did it's research. But that doesn't make up for the bad acting and the shear bordum I felt watching it.
'Alexander' had the potential to be something truly amazing. But it was a seriously missed opportunity that really disappointed me.",4,1,1,6 August 2019
Chicken Run," It's Okay
","I like Dreamsworks and the work they did with Aardman Animation. 'Flushed Away' is one of my favorite kids films, and a movie I grew up watching non-stop. And 'Wallace and Gromitt: Curse of the Were-Rabbit' is another personal favorite. However, out of the three films they worked on together, 'Chicken Run' is my least favorite.It's not a bad movie (read the headline). It's just that my opinion, this would have benefitted from being shorter. Like a fifteen minute short or something. And along with that, this film uses way too many cliches, such as the liar revealed.But along with the criticisms, there's a lot to enjoy. I think the villain is a lot of fun, the animation is great, and it's just a fun film. But to me, it just feels like this movie had no reason to be as long it was, let alone be a theatrical release. I think the movie has too much filler, and skretches out it's simple story too long.'Chicken Run' is a good movie. I enjoy watching it, and despite it's problems, it's still a film I can watch many times. It's a fun little movie, and it's okay.",6,0,0,7 August 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," What a Stupid Movie
","This movie is terrible and scientifically inaccurate. It is science fiction but there is a difference between science fiction and not caring.This film is the latter. This movie expects to believe that global warming will cause another Ice Age. And expects us to believe this process of only a few weeks. And expects to believe this will happen threw ice hurricanes that form over land. And don't get me started with the stupid scenes in this film. Such as the scene where tornadoes destroy L.A in California, A place with many hills which makes tornadoes nearly unable to happen.And a scene where New York floods to be followed by a blizzard. Which leads to my favorite scene where our characters run from the eye of the ice hurricane, and they are able to out run cold air.The movie ends on a happy note (for some reason). Even though Western Civilization is dead and the worlds most powerful nations like the US, UK, France and Russia are big blocks of ice. And considering most of the Northern Hemisphere is iced over this would no doubt cause mass famine killing millions, maybe billions.So, why end The Day After Tomorrow on a happy note? In the end this isn't one of the worst movies ever made, I've seen much worst but that does not excuse this film.",2,2,8,2 January 2019
Spider-Man 3," Deserving of a Little More Praise
","Introduction:Many people are not very fond of this film. But I am. And I don't care what other people think. I can love the movie if I want to.What I Like:Spider-Man 3 is probably the weakest the trilogy, I agree with that. The writing's not as good, the film is a little clunky, and it suffers from more issues than that. I will go more in depth into that later. But I'm here to talk about what I like.I love the character's in this film. There is a logical progression with them. Peter, after years of saving the city, he finally gets the recognition he deserves, and the people love him. And because of that the praise gets to his head, and he develops an ego. Mary Jane gets big an theater, but when she suffers rejection, it conflicts with Peter's success. Harry is finally ready to fight Spider-Man, after two films developing his thirst for revenge him.And while the film is very cluttered with villains, I think all of them are interesting in their own way.Harry, was easily the best out of all of them, as he had truly transformed into his father, a man he wasn't. Consumed with vengeance, he is however, eventually able to redeem himself. Sandman was also a descent villain, the scene of his birth was beautiful. With effects that somewhat hold up. And told entirely through visuals, it could work as it's own short film. And while cliche, his motivation does work. And he does have a tie to the narrative and the main character.And Venom, who's easily the most out of place character in this film. As he doesn't fit the theme of forgiveness. In the film, Peter had to forgive Sandman for killing his Uncle Ben. Harry has to forgive Peter for apparently killing his father. Mary Jane has to forgive Peter for not being the best boyfriend. However, Eddie Brock doesn't have to forgive anybody.However, Venom is still an interesting character. As Eddie Brock is a corrupt reporter, who after being fired for forgery, grows a hatred for Spider-Man. Even though people say Topher Grace was a miscasting, he did still put up a good performance. Well adapting the comic book character.The action scenes are arguably better the first movie. My favorite one being the fight between Peter and Harry early in the film. It's fun to watch, and while the effects don't hold up, the scene is still a rush.The visual style also has that Raimi charm to it. Looking like a comic book world.And here's an unpopular opinion, I like emo Peter. I think the comedy on this part was entirely intentional, and while I preferred a more serious take on the symbiote aspect of the story, I think the scenes of emo Peter are hilarious. I honestly think the campiness was intentional in these movies. And I think rather than laugh at the movie, and to steal a quote 'You are laughing with the movie.'What I Don't Like:Well, I did say I would talk about what I don't like: so I will do that. Where do I start? Well, Venom feels very out of place, he doesn't fit with the theme. The amnesia plot with Harry is really stupid. And is probably the worse part of it's clunky writing. When Harry should've been the main villain. And the movie doesn't feel like it has a main villain. And the issues of course don't end there, but I'm just beating a dead horse.Conclusion:Now, many might ask, do I like the Amazing Spider-Man 2? And to answer, I don't. Why? Because Spider-Man 3 knows it's stupid. This movie thinks it's super serious. And a great superhero drama. When that's not the case, and you are laughing at it's unintentional hilarity. So I can hate that movie and love this one. And no one will convince me otherwise.",5,2,12,30 June 2019
Gettysburg," The Best American Civil War Movie
","The American Civil War was a conflict that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, and nearly broke a nation. And the famous battle of that historical conflict, was the Battle of Gettysburg. It was a real turning point in the war, the last attempt of a fragmenting South, to make an advance on their northern neighbors. The attempt failed, and the South was on a long loosing streak, until their eventual surrender.And this 4 and a half hour epic, chronicles the events of that battle with perfect presision and historical accuracy. In fact, it needed to be accurate if the people who wanted it to be made.As back in 1993, the director Ronald F. Maxwell wanted to film his movie at the location the battle was fought, Gettysburg, PA. However, if he wanted to film it at the location. He would have to be as accurate as possible. If he wasn't, he couldn't make the movie on that historical landmark. So, he decided to stay true to the events.First off, the film doesn't antagonize the South or the North, treating both sides of the war with respect. We see the battle from the perspective of the generals who lead the battle, and stay accurate to the orders they gave, and the issues they went through.The film's 4 hour run time, in my opinion, was also needed, if they wanted to adapt everything that happened. And in my opinion, the film is never boring, it never felt like it had filler. We see the mistakes that all the Confederates continually made. And what lead to them loosing.'Gettysburg' was a film that required historical accuracy. The people behind it had a passion for this battle, and wanted to portray it on screen. And I think this is a good example of how historical accuracy is possible and required in a movie about history.The costumes are accurate, the film really focuses on the tactics, staying true to exactly what happened. The acting and visuals are also astounding to watch. The film truly recreates the historical Battle of Gettysburg.In conclusion, 'Gettysburg' a film that respects history, and is almost a love letter to the battle. It doesn't feel long, it rarely makes things up, the acting is great, and the visuals all perfectly adapt the story of the battle. 'Gettysburg' is simply one of the greatest historical movies ever made, and the best Civil War movie ever made.",7,2,2,13 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not Deserving of All the Hate
","Introduction:Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is easily the most despised of the Star Wars films. But does it deserve that title? I don't think so. And I don't care what people claim. Sure, it's on the bottom of every Star Wars movie ranking list, but does that change my opinion? No. Attack of the Clones is a seriously underrated film, and a film deserving of a lot more praise than it gets.Defense:Many people complain about Anakin's characterization, the overuse of CGI, the film's dialogue, and that the film is apparently boring. But I don't think any of that criticism is valid. Now, let me explain it all more thoroughly and debunk the regurgitated arguments against the film.The most common criticism is against film is the performance of Hayden Christensen. I've said this on numerous occasions, and I have to say it again, I think his performance was great. And in the context of the character's story and the way he's written, the performance makes sense. Anakin was born in as a slave, and in the previous film, the Jedi took him out of that slave life. And took him away from his mother. They also forbid him from doing many things, like showing emotion, and they didn't let him interact with Padme, a person he was infatuated with for quite some time. Not allowed to show his emotions, he was forced to bottle up his feelings.And now, getting visions of his mother, who hasn't scene in a while, possibly dying. As well as finally meeting Padme again, for the first time in years. So when people complain about him acting awkward around her, it's because he's talking to a girl he likes, and has liked for years. Also, Anakin never really learned how to talk to people who weren't Jedi. So for people who complain that Anakin doesn't act normal, it's because he never learned how to. With the performance and writing, makes sense for him to act the way he does, all monotone. And him few spurts of emotion make sense as well.And many also criticize the acting of everyone, and I disagree with this complaint. The acting in the Original Trilogy, was quite hokey and doesn't hold up. But people don't hate on that. It's okay to criticize it if you don't like it, you just can't be a hypocrite.Many also hate the apparent 'overuse' of CGI and computer effects. I never got this criticism. At the time, the CGI looked great and was revolutionary, and sure it doesn't hold up today, but of course it's gonna age. The Original Trilogy had effects that were ahead of their time. But those don't hold up either. And that's fine, those movies are still great. It's just a fact that some aspects of a film will age. Great films coming out today that use computer effects, wait 10 years, they'll age. Avengers: Endgame, a great movie, came out this year, and uses just as much CGI, but do people complain, no. Again, don't be a hypocrite, and be consistent. Apply everything to the same level of scrutiny. And honestly, I like the decision to add as many effects as they did. It gives a film a look that's different from the Original trilogy, but still something that looks like Star Wars film. And it was a bold choice on Lucas's part. Effects age, but do know what doesn't age? Good writing. And trust me this film has it.And most criticize this film's dialogue. Similar to the acting, the Originals had dialogue just as bad. But of course, people forget about that. And I know, many might be asking about the line. 'I don't like sand.', I think the parodies and spoofs of that line, are very funny. But the line is not that bad. Sure it's been made fun of, but it's just one line. That kind of has a poetic meaning to it, as Anakin was born on Tatooine, a sand planet, where he was a slave. Not having the fondest memories from living there, he would probably grow a hatred for anything that reminds him of that planet. And yes, I groan at the line. But it's not as bad as most claim.Another common criticism with it is the apparent fact that the film is 'boring'. Every reviewer on the Internet has vomited out this poorly thought out argument. But, they never explain it. Is it the romance? Is the action? What is it? In every prequel hate video that I've watched, it's never been explained properly, so it's a little hard to rebuttal. I was never bored watching it. Considering the invalid and ridiculous criticisms I've debunked, I think it's boring to them, because they weren't paying attention to the film, which is what all the haters do.Conclusion:Many people believe that it's a fact that the prequels are bad. No, it's all opinion. It's all objective. And if this review didn't convince you to view the film the way I do. That's fine, I don't ask you to like this movie. I just want you to know my opinion. Because I use to hate this film to. Because of what Internet reviewers claimed about it. But upon recent reevaluation. I realized the film is not that bad. So I ask you to think for yourself. Do you hate it because you think it's bad? Or because the Internet told you? I asked myself that, and came to my conclusion, and you should come to yours.",7,6,8,30 June 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America: The First Avenger Review
","Captain America: The First Avenger is an okay movie. Not essential to Captain America, but still has a nice cheesy 40's charm. A problem I do have with the movie is that Steve Rogers doesn't become Captain America until the middle of the movie. And the scenes before he becomes Captain America are quite boring to be honest I would like this movie a lot more if he was started punching Nazi's earlier. Another complaint might be that their isn't as much Nazi punching as there should be, its only really in one montage (admittedly a great montage). My favorite part the movie was probably the World War II action and montage. Overall the movie is harmless and does deserve a watch.",8,0,0,4 January 2019
"I, Robot"," Read the Book, Don't Watch the Film.
","Introduction:I, Robot is personally my favorite science fiction novel. Written by Isaac Asimov, the book is a collection of stories about a future where robots serve the role as sort of helpers for humans. and the book raises many interesting questions about what the future holds, and many questions about Artificial Intelligence. And is a truly unique story, as it was written because the author was tired of all the generic stories of robots rebelling against the humans. And created a story where that doesn't happen, and the ending is cleaver, I dare not give it away. To summarize, the novel is one of the smartest pieces of literature ever written.So, how does the film hold up? Does it respect the source material? Is it a unique film? Well, considering the low rating I gave it, I think you can guess. The film is a terrible adaptation, that has nothing to do with the novel. And only takes the title of the great book, so people would go to the theater. Not because they wanted to adapt it, they just wanted to cash in the nostalgia of the book. Ans that's 'cause the film is what Isaac Asimov hated, and didn't want to write. He didn't to write a generic, cliche, by the numbers story where robots rebel against humanity, because that had been done to death before. But this film decides to be exactly that. It turns an original and amazing set of stories, and turns it into a mediocre and unoriginal story.The Story & Characters:If this was a film with a different title, and it wasn't connected to Asimov's story. I would just call it mediocre. But sense it isn't, I have to call it out.The movie centers around our boring protagonist, Will Smith. I can't remember his name, so it's Will Smith. Who teams up with some robot, as he unlocks a conspiracy that threatens humanity. Will Smith's character is a technophobe. Yet, it's ironic, that he conveniently has a robotic arm that helps him. And is only there for the sake of convenience.And as I mentioned before, it disrespects the source material completely. I don't even think the writers read the book. As I think it might be a slight adaptation of one of the stories, but it doesn't follow it.I mostly hate this film for being an adaptation that doesn't work. If it had nothing to do with the book, I'd give it a pass. But I can't.The Visuals:The visuals in this film are pretty bad by today's standards, but I do believe they were okay back then. And even then, I think the sleek look to everything is nice, and it did kind of try to adapt the novel in that way, I guess. Even if I imagine Asimov's world differently.Conclusion:I hate this film. I hate that when you search up 'I, Robot' on Google, the film comes up. I hate that this film has the audacity, to take the name of a great book, and destroy it. Make it into something it's not, the opposite of what is. This film should've never been made.And honestly, the worse part is, I would really like a film adaptation. As a sort of anthology movie. It could be a great movie, maybe even one of the greatest of all time. But we have this forgettable mess.There is no effort put into this adaptation, it doesn't try. It just portrays the robots as beings that got too smart, and while it does try to make it sympathetic, it's not focused on enough. And it's not like the book. It's nice to take something into a new direction. But make sure that direction isn't off a cliff.",3,0,2,1 July 2019
The Patriot," Not Accurate in the Slightest
","Introduction:I know people like this film, but I don't. It's seriously historically inaccurate, to the point that it gets in the way of the film's quality. Mel Gibson really stretches the truth with this film. And I simply don't the movie because of this.Why I Don't Like It:The movie centers around a man named, Benjamin Martin. Who fights against the British, after an officer murders his son. And this is one of my problems with the movie. Benjamin Martin never existed, and he's very generic in this film, after some evil people kill his son, he wants revenge. Is that a drama about the American Revolution? Or some stupid action film? The film also vilifies the British, treated them like they were evil. And claiming the Americans could do no wrong.Like when the film claimed that the Americans offered any slave freedom if they joined the army, and saying the British didn't do that. When they did, and most of the time kept the promise. And it makes the film feel like American propaganda. As it glorifies everything they did in the revolution. It feels like an elementary school lesson on the Revolution, not a film made for adults.Good Qualities:While I don't like this movie, I think the film has a nice production design, great acting, and good directing. The main issue is with the writing, technically it's the a descent film, at least in these regards.Conclusion:Even with the good qualities, I think The Patriot is still a bad movie. While I think Mel Gibson is a good actor, and has made some very good movies, I did love Hacksaw Ridge. But I didn't love this movie.",4,1,5,1 July 2019
Spider-Man," A Classic in Every sense of the Word
","Intro:Many might be baffled by the 9/10 rating I gave this film. Many call it dated, and not as good as you remember. But, I think this film is every bit as good as you originally recalled, if not even better.What I Love:While this film is very cheesy, it's the classic origin of our favorite wall-crawler. I absolutely adore the storytelling of this film, with Sam Raimi's charm all over this film. From the incredibly relatable character of Peter Parker, and how he transforms into a superhero. As we see both the origins of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin happen at the same in the beginning of the movie.And while many might call it stupid, or over the top. These characters live in an over the top universe.And the world building is perfect. I feel like New York is a person. As we see the people of the city on screen. All the extras in this film are so colorful and have so much character, even though they're on screen for meat seconds.And every moment of this film is so fun to watch. The action, while dated, is very entertaining. The character interactions, are very entertaining. This was a childhood classic for me, and part of the reason I love it so much, is because it's very entertaining.I also enjoy the visual style of the film. It's so energetic in it's look. Just by looking at the film, you can tell Sam Raimi made it. It is drenched in his unique style of visuals. It uses CGI very well, and while the effects don't hold up, I think it helps the visual flare of this film. The city looks like it's out of a comic book, with the bright colors and vibrant locations.But, the best part of the film, are the characters. Toby MaGuire is still my favorite live action Spider-Man. And James Franco plays my favorite Harry Osborn. And Willem Dafoe plays the seriously over the top Green Goblin, and I love the performance.Peter Parker, he is played by an at the time, twenty something actor. Feels like a real needy teenager. He feels relatable. And he is an interesting character. Many might say he doesn't tell enough jokes. But I'm convinced it grounds him in a way. As it makes him feel more real. If I was battling a super villain, I wouldn't be telling be jokes, I would honestly be terrified.Harry Osborn, while in the other films, often over the top, Harry is still a three dimensional character. As he was often not treated well and neglected by his father. And his story over the course of this series. And this is demonstrated so we'll, in several scenes. Like when Harry introduces his father to Peter, calling him Norman Osborn, really showing the disconnect between the two. And at graduation, Norman congratulating Peter more than his own son.Norman Osborn is a really fun villain. With a wonderfully over the top performance in the part of Willem Dafoe. But he's a very interesting villain, as he was a rich businessman, who from the surface, seemed like a normal person. But from beneath, was really a cold hearted monster, and once he was turned into the Green Goblin, showed his true colors.Conclusion:Many might pick at the issues with this film, the campiness, the dated effects, the over the top nature, and other things. But that doesn't stop me from loving this film and the other two in the trilogy, even Spider-Man 3. I will always love the film. It was a great superhero film when it came out, and it's a great film even today.",8,2,2,29 June 2019
The Exorcist," The Exorcist: How to Not Craft Horror
","I like horror. It's possibly my favorite genre of entertainment, and 'The Exorcist' is one of the most praised and famous pieces of horror cinema. But...I frankly hate it.'But it's a classic.' you might say. Yes, it is. But just because it's old, or widely praised, doesn't mean it's good. In fact, classic is a very loose term, and just because it's considered one, doesn't mean I am obligated to enjoy something I don't like. Maybe it was scary at the time, but the horror doesn't hold up. And it's not because it's old. Older films like 'The Man Who Laughs' (1928) or 'Psycho' (1960) are amazing films still scare, and some of the best to come out horror.Now, what are my issues? Well, for one thing, it's not scary, and a lot of it is actually funny. I'm sorry, vomit and piss is not scary. And is also way too long, focussing on uninteresting subplots and dull characters. Also, scenes like the scene where the possessed girl mutilated herself is not frightening, way too over the top, and even a little offensive. And it tries way too hard to make the audience feel something with unnesary amounts of gore that just disgusts the audience.Now, is there anything I like? Well, yes. I did like the performances, they are really believable and felt real. It's just the film fails in everything else.This movie just has me asking myself - 'Why does this have an 8/10 on this cite? Why do people like it? Why does it have a spot on the Top 250? How is it scary?' And so many other many other questions, questions that me confused. I've watched this so many times, trying to understand the love for this film, but I don't get it. If you like it, that's fine. But please, respect my opinion. And I will respect your's.",4,1,7,6 August 2019
Pearl Harbor," Nothing but American Propaganda!
","I hate Muchael Bay movies. It's not a surprise, they suck. And while the 'Transformers' films are terrible and nonsensical, 'Pearl Harbor' is on a different level of bad, the level of offensive. It was a complete waste of three hours, it doesn't respect history, it doesn't it's audience, and it doesn't respect other cultures. And it's an atrocity to cinema.'Pearl Harbor' is an incredibly bias historical film, that rather than tell history, decides to be America propaganda. Villifying the Japanese, and feeling more like a wartime propaganda film than a legitemite historical film.First criticism, the romance is terrible and main characters never existed. And because of that, we never become attached to these characters, or the events. With a movie like 'Titanic' (love or hat it) personal I love it, and it's miles better than this. Even though the characters didn't exist, you see them interact with the real people. In this movie, they're away from the action. And when we see the action, there's no attachment to anything, because we didn't get to know the people being killed.And the Japanese are portrayed as evil villians who shoot at hospitals and kill without mercy. We don't get to know the Japanese, and the film comes across as offensive. I have some strong opinions against Doug Walker and Channel Awesome, but his review of 'Pearl Harbor' somed up all my thoughts and criticisms. And frankly, it's one of my favorite movie reviews of all time. So, watch that, because I'm done. Watch the review, not the movie. I'm done.",2,2,6,6 August 2019
Independence Day," Seriously Overrated
","Introduction:I hate Independence Day. There's no originality, it's filled with cliches, the characters are stereotypes of stereotypes. It's just a very stupid action movie, that makes absolutely no sense.The Good:Let's start with the good, the very little there is. The film's action is fun to watch, and Will Smith is descent in his role, even if his character has no character, and I think the alien designs are the most creative thing in the film.The Bad:As I mentioned before, the film has an incredible lack of originality. The story is your generic aliens try and take the world story, just dumber. As the characters make stupid decisions, like letting the president go into battle. The Roswell UFO Crash being real. The film is just really dumb, and many might say, it's meant to be stupid. Well, if it wanted my brain to hurt, it succeeded. The film is almost intelligence insulting. And here's something, people hate on Battle Los Angeles, a terrible movie, for the same reason they like Independence Day.The characters are also uninteresting, just saying catchphrases, and being stereotypes. Like Jeff Goldblum is a Jewish stereotype, Will Smith is a black stereotype. The actors are clearly not trying, and the film just feels like no effort is put into it. The aliens are also just generic, they have no character, and they're just evil. And I wouldn't mind so much, if the creators weren't trying to make an original alien invasion film.I just don't get it! What's the love for this film? There are so many better action and science fiction films. This one barely stands out. It's just another stupid movie. And I can kind of understand somebody liking it. It's dumb. Everyone has a guilty-pleasure. But there are so many people that enjoy this film. And that's what I don't get.Conclusion:Well, I've probably put more effort into this review, than the writers put into the movie. It's not very good. I can't stand this film, it's lazy, it's stupid, and it's cliche. There is nothing original about it, and I don't get it.",3,2,6,1 July 2019
Toy Story 4," And I Thought This Film Would Suck...
","Introduction:
Like many people, I thought this film would be the weakest in the series, and a pointless sequel. But man, I was wrong. We were all wrong. From the first trailer, I thought it would have been disappointing, like I was with 'Incredibles 2', but I can say with much confidence, that 'Toy Story 4' was another satisfying entry in the 'Toy Story' series.The Story:
After the third film, me, like any other thought there was nowhere else to go with the series. As it felt like the perfect final chapter. However, it turns out you could still expand the story. As the writers thought of a perfect ending to the story of Woody. As in the film, Woody feels as if he doesn't belong, as cowboy doll is likely to not get the attention a little girl. Which leads to a satisfying ending to his arc. Not only that, but this is probably the most mature film in the series, as it deals with themes of independence, and being loved. The film also has very good comedic writing, in my opinion. This film is a logical progression of the story of the 'Toy Story' trilogy.My only real issues with the story, is the fact that the other characters take a lot more a backseat than the other movies. However, this is Woody's movie, so I should expect it to not focus on them. And it is only a small criticism I have with the film's story.The Characters:
Both the new and old characters are either, just as good as they were in the previous films, and the new characters are nice additions to the 'Toy Story' series. They all go through a logical progression and grow as the film goes on, and the same thing goes for the new characters.Animation:
Like the previous films, the animation is just as good, and true Pixar level 3D animation. Of course the good animation quality is gonna be good, it's Pixar. But I still felt it's something to praise.Conclusion:
In conclusion, this film is an entertaining watch, a logical progression of the story, and a surprisingly satisfying film. It was worth the 9 year wait, and I loved this movie as much as the other films in the franchise. And some of Pixar's best work.",7,123,219,23 June 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Too Long
","Introduction:I love the Lord of the Rings films, is it a surprise? Probably not. But I don't like this film, or really just the Hobbit Trilogy. A problem I had with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, was the fact that there was a lot of filler, and the fact that were 3 hours long, when they could've been shortened. However, they were based on a 1000 paged book. But the Hobbit is based on a much shorter book. And for that matter, only based on the first 3 chapters. And I just hate this film.What I Don't Like:The film is such a drag. It's based on the first 3 chapters of the Hobbit book, as I explained before. But this could honestly been one movie. The first 3 chapters are not that long, and the book is not that long. But Lord of the Rings is long, so it can't be one movie. But this can, and it doesn't add anything the book, it just has filler.And that's my problem with the movie, the ridiculous amounts of filler. It creates a long and boring film, that I couldn't wait for the ending of.What I Like:The think the acting is fine, the visuals are nice, and as a film, it's okay. It just doesn't compare to the original. And commits one of the worst sins a movie could make, be boring.Conclusion:I don't like this movie. It's an obvious cash in, as it has no real reason to exist, it's boring, and filler is everywhere. I still love the Lord of the Rings films, but I don't love the Hobbit films.",5,1,2,2 July 2019

The Number 23," Joel Schumacher's Worst Movie!
","I am of the unpopular opinion that Joel Schumacher is actually a very talented filmmaker. I can defend 'Batman Forever' all day, and 'Phone Booth' as well as 'Falling Down' are two of my favorite films. But--but--I can't defend this one. It's so bad. It's a good idea, a mysterious book, but it's executed in the worse way. Honestly, it's worse than 'Batman and Robin', and I mean it.The movie is really stupid, really boring, nonsensical and just a travesty. The twist is infamously ridiculous. Oh, it was Jim Carrey the whole time, he just forgot. What a load of stupidity.This review is gonna be short, I usually write longer, but I'm done. I can't think about this movie without dying inside. So, it sucks. The end!",1,1,2,16 September 2019
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," This Film Deserves A Higher Rating
","Intro:
Good Night, and Good Luck is simple a masterpiece, comparable to Citizen Kane. An accurate retelling of the story of Edward R. Murrow. And it's more than deserving of a rating higher than measly 7.5/10.The Story:
Telling the story of broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow, and how he seeked to bring down Joseph McCarthy. This film really knows how to bring you into the time period, with the use of black and white (which will go more in depth to later). But mostly the way it's written, taking inspiration from old 50's and 60's films, and presenting itself like a film from that era.And the film also presents the question, how far can you take journalism? As the Murrow doesn't just say what's going on, but he also presents his thoughts on it, and claims that McCarthy's ways are wrong. Telling the United States government to tell him otherwise. Almost like a sort of war, between him and U.S. government. As both sides present what they think is right the American people.
Another thing to really praise is the dialogue, it's straight to point about the issues, and presented to us like it was from an old 50's film. Again, really bringing the audience into the time period.It's this so called war in the film, is all done with words. Arguing for or against each others ideals. Crafting a great film about standing up for what you believe in, and not being afraid to stand up for it. At the same time, very little is made up, it was all real. And that's what for me, makes or breaks a historical film, or biography.It's truly a film rich with atmosphere, interesting characters, and interesting dialogue. And truly, a film with a great story.The Characters:
Like I said before, very little is made up. So, the characters are all adapted perfectly from their real life counterparts. And along with that, good performances in the mix. It's amazing how this film presents Murrow, as some of the stuff he says about McCarthy is almost unbelievable. Such as, calling him, 'Leader of the jackals.' It's simply insane some of the stuff they could say back then.And the same really goes for the supporting characters.The Visual Style:
As I mentioned before, this's filmed in black and white. And it crafts an interesting and outstanding visual style. Really making it feel like an old film from the mid 20th Century. And as someone who likes black and white films, and if I made a film, it would probably be in black and white, I can appreciate this movie's use of this technique. In my opinion, a very underrated technique, that allows a movie to stand out.Conclusion:
All I have to say, is thank you. I thank the people that made this movie, for crafting a piece of truly amazing art. And I will always come back to this film, because it's a movie that inspires me, and if I made a movie, (something I wanna do), I would take inspiration from this movie, as well as some others, but they can the spotlight in some other review. So to end this review, watch the film, it might change you like it changed me.",10,1,1,27 June 2019
Toy Story," A Film That Made My Childhood
","Introduction:
'Toy Story' was the first film to come out of Pixar. And frankly, it still remains as one of the best. While, in my opinion, the weakest film in the series, that doesn't mean it's at all bad. Toy Story is still an amazing film, and one of the best animated films of all time.The Story:
Telling the story of two enemies that becomes best friends by the end. Not needing to be complicated, the film tells a very simple story, that can be enjoyed by adults and kids.And I just love the idea of what the toys in your room are up to while you're not looking.The Characters:
Woody and Buzz Light-year are two of my favorite characters in all of cinema. As they both go through their respective arcs. Woody learning that he doesn't have to be the center of his owner Andy's attention. And Buzz, who learns that he can accept the place he has in the world.The Animation:
Being the first full length computer animated movie, the style was impressive for time, but is not all that impressive today. However, it did look good back then, and I can forgive the film.Conclusion:
Toy Story may not be my favorite in the Toy Story series, but it's still a great film. And one of my favorite films of all time.",9,0,0,25 June 2019
Saw," The Master of Suspense
","Intro:
'Saw' is a masterfully made movie, and a film that understands building tension and keeping the audience in constant suspense.Pros:
This is a movie easily deserving of a spot up there with some of the best horror movies ever made. 'Saw' has a shockingly original premise of two people chained in a bathroom. Being forced to either cut through their feet, or both die. The movie lives to it, by building tension to the point that you can't wait for the ending. And the twist ending satisfies. The movie is mostly set in one location, and I love one location movies, because it allows the writers to be creative. And while it doesn't stay in that location the entire time, it doesn't take away from the suspense. As the movie goes on, both of our main characters learn more about each other. And that there's more to it, then them just being there by chance.Cons:
The only issue I have with the film is the acting. The performances on the part of our two leads are pretty bad, they both have really bad reads. But I can forgive the film for it's big flaw.Conclusion:
I love 'Saw'. It's one of my favorite horror films. Many critics might call it a gore fest, but the film doesn't focus on the gore, it focuses on the story. It's interesting, it's suspenseful, and it's a great watch.",10,0,2,5 July 2019
Up," Good Not Great
","Introduction:Up is considered by many to be in the top five of the best Pixar films. However, Up for me, doesn't make my top 10. Don't get me wrong, Up is a good movie. I just don't think it's a masterpiece.Thoughts:The first ten minutes of Up are simply amazing, absolutely perfect, and can work as it's own short film. However, it's not a short film. It's a 90 minute movie. And the other 80 minutes is really just okay to me.My biggest problem with the film is really the villain. For a company that has made such great villains, I can't even remember this guy's name. And the kid character is also a little dull. I think Carl is still a great character, and he's one of my favorite Pixar protagonists. The movie has a nice creativity to it, and it's very entertaining.I like the animation of the film. The CGI backgrounds are very nice. The character models are cartoonish, and fit in this world very well. With bright colors to go along with it, the animation is great Pixar CGI.I just think people blow out proportion, because of the first ten minutes. The first ten minutes is amazing, but the other 80 minutes is good, but not amazing.Conclusion:I like the movie. I don't think it's amazing, but I like it. I think the first ten minutes is a little too blown out of proportion.But the rest of the movie is still good. Up is in fact, a good movie, not one my favorites from Pixar, but still a great watch.",7,1,2,1 July 2019
Stalingrad," Amazing Film About War!
","Many WWII movies depict German soldiers as blood-thirsty, heartless killing machine. But this film shows us that not all German soldiers during the war were bad people. 'Stalingrad' is an excellent film that mostly centers around a group of German soldiers during the Battle of Stalingrad. While at the same time seeing the war from both sides, seeing both the good and evil people in the war. Not just saying the Germans were the only evil people. Seeing the side of the Germans from the very human perspective. Making it, what I think is...one of the best war movies ever made.As I mentioned before, the movie tells the battle from a German perspective, creating very interesting characters I can sympathize with and find interesting. As we first see the characters on the way to Stalingrad, very confident in their own abilities, as by this point in the war, Germany was winning. But by the time they get to Stalingrad, they suffer through some of the worst conditions imaginable. And you find yourself caring for the characters, as they weren't bad people, just people fighting for the wrong side.The action in this movie is also great, many may criticize the way it's shot and edited, but I like it. The way it's shot adds a certain degree of confusion and chaos to it all. As the battle was very chaotic and violent.The film also stands out, because it has more of a heart and soul. While I appreciate films like Private Ryan a lot, but I think this one is better, because I felt more invested watching it. We understand the motives and flaws of everybody, and it's so interesting to watch. In most WWII movies, your wishing those pesky Germans die. But here, you actually route for these people, even though you know what happened in history.'Stalingrad' is an excellent movie about war, and easily...my favorite film about war. 'Saving Private Ryan' might be better known, or more of a classic, but this is better made and more interesting. This is a war that stands out among countless others like it, and one of my favorite films of all time.",9,2,3,6 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," My Favorite Star Wars Film
","Introduction:I am not afraid to say it, this is my favorite Star Wars film. And I'm not gonna lie, I love the Star Wars Prequels. And I'm not afraid to say it with incredible amounts of confidence. And no matter how many little nitpicks or issues you can find in all three of these films, I will continue loving them. It was my introduction to star Wars. And the reason Star Wars is still my favorite film franchise. When I first watched the film I loved it for the spectacle, which it succeeds at. But going back to it, I can commend it for it's great writing. Many might criticize the movie, but I have nothing but praise.Revenge of the Sith is not only a great Star Wars film, but a great film. A film that practically crafted my childhood. And I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I don't have to agree with the majority. I'd rather be a free thinker, than just another sheep. It was a film that I fell in love with, and a film that still leaves an effect on me.Why I Love It:1. The Characters:
The number one reason I love the film is because of the characters. We see how they became the way they were in the original films. In this Shakespearean tragedy. As we see the transformation of our center character, Anakin Skywalker. From a once great Jedi, to an evil and ruthless Sith Lord, and a pawn of Lord Sidious.Hayden Christiansen as Anakin, Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan, and Ian McDiarmid as Darth Sidious. Are three of my favorite performances in film history. They each have so much range.As Anakin is usually a robot from the surface, but when the events force him, he shows emotion. Feeling like a pawn of the Jedi, and that they are people that don't respect him, after all he did for them. Basically being the poster boy for them, going into endless battles for them. They don't treat him the way he feels. Then them expecting him to betray friends, and lie for them. As well as the stress of his secret marriage being discovered and the possibility of his wife Padme dying in childbirth. It was easy for secret Sith Lord, Darth Sidious or Palpatine, to manipulate him into joining his side. With stories of ways to bring back the dead. And his shaking trust with the Jedi. Seeing the holes in their teachings and hypocrisy. As a person who has been through a lot in his life. Starting out as a slave boy, then being taken by the Jedi away from his mother, and her later dying. The Jedi told him to bottle up his emotions. Putting on a mask in front of the Jedi. Still being a good person at heart, wanting to do the right thing, but really not fully understanding what it means to cross the line. But by the end of the film, becoming an evil Sith Lord obsessed with power.Obi-Wan's character in this film is interesting as well. As he is a character who has a brotherly bond to Anakin, but couldn't be more different from him. This is shown in both their actions, with Anakin killing Dooku early into the film, something Obi-Wan wouldn't do, among other things. But also, the clothing they wear. Obi-Wan wore a white and brown Jedi robe in the film, showing his devotion and faith in the light side, so powerful it was basically unbreakable. However, Anakin wore black clothing, representing his shaky devotion to the light side, and inner darkness. But the man was not flawless, he was so sure of the Jedi's teachings never questioning it. And refusing to acknowledge that it was the partly the fault of the Jedi that they were destroyed. And partly his fault that Anakin turned, as there bond was too close, and attachment was forbidden by the Jedi.Last character I will analyze is Darth Sidious. One of my favorite villains, devious, evil and calculated. He was so smart that he won. He took over the galaxy and achieved all his goals. With an over the top performance, but subtle moments as well. Where he quietly plants seeds of the dark side inside Anakin. And takes advantage of the politics and the arrogance of the Jedi, and their hypocritical nature. As well as the corruption in the Senate to manipulate everyone and take over. Truly evil, as he sits back and laughs at everyone's misery. Ian McDiarmid puts all his effort into this performance. And George Lucas puts all of his effort into his writing.I've been talking about this for a while, so I will end it here. I haven't talked about the other characters, because I wanted to discuss my favorite in depth but I love all the other characters. The only character I didn't like was General Grievous, he felt kind of pointless. And had almost no character, and didn't feel like a threat. But all the other characters are great to watch.2. The Story:The film's writing is perfect. The story is entertaining and it gets darker as the film continues. Starting out with a light-hearted sequence of space action, to shifting into dark imagery of Anakin killing Count Dooku. Showing his true self to him, and letting it out, as he cuts off the head of the Sith, making an unsettling sound, that gives me chills every time. To some more action, the film steadily gets darker in tone. As by the end many of the characters are dead. And the galaxy has a dark future ahead itself. Uttering a new era.I also like the pasting, even though there's a very long period of no action and mostly talking. It's not boring as you are still invested. And it makes it the fastest two hours I've spent watching a film. And making it the most entertaining of the Star Wars films.I could praise the story all day, but I can't make the review too long. So, I'll say this, this is in my opinion, the best written Star Wars film. Pastes well, entertaining, perfect when it comes to tone, and written like an epic poem or Shakespearean tragedy, as I mentioned before.3. The Visuals & ActionThis film has visuals that for the time were incredible, and some that still hold up fifteen years later. The effects team for this film put in a lot of passion and effort. And it was a bold choice on Lucas's part to use computer effects, a technology in it's infancy. Creating a unique looking film, that was ahead of it's time with great lighting and creative worlds.The action is also great, with big and grand set pieces, along with great choreography. Containing what I think is the best lightsaber duel in the series, Anakin and Obi-Wan's final fight, though long, packs an emotional punch, and looks great. With fast editing, and fast movement, along with a setting, and great sword clashing. This fight is still favorite, as it has emotions, as they have the most difficult fight of their lives and careers as Jedi.The action and visuals are amazing. Marvelous to look at and behold, the film succeeds in this category as well.Conclusion:Revenge of the Sith is my favorite Star Wars, and one of my favorite films. The characters are great, the visuals are spectacular for it's time, the writing is on point, and the action is amazing. Many prefer Empire, but while Empire is a fun film with great characters and story. Revenge plays like a poetic and Shakespearean tragedy. A film that I find few flaws with, and a film I will rewatch over and over again.",10,11,14,30 June 2019
Mary and Max," A Great Example of How to Make Stop Motion Film
","Review:
'Mary and Max' is a very dark movie, that shouldn't be funny, but somehow is. This creates a very unique film. 'Mary and Max' is one of my favorite animated films of all time, and an excellent example of how to make a stop motion film.The film centers around the friendship of two people, a young girl named Mary (who lives in Australia), and an old man named Max (who lives in the U.S.). And in the film communicate through letters.Let's start with the excellent animation, the clay animation is unique and nice to look at. Even if it's meant to look dark and depressing, you can't take your eyes off it. The look of the film, is truly a marvel to behold, as the darker shades of color, really contribute to the tone of the film. As it is a dark film, with many elements of comedy.Now: the characters, the two title characters of the film, are two very interesting, down to earth, and relatable people. As they are two very depressed people, who see nothing but darkness, but over the course of the film, grow a bond even though they are so far apart from each other. And learn to see each other as a light in the darkness, and just see the world in a nicer light. The only issue I have with the side characters, they are just not very well developed in my opinion. If the movie dedicated more time to these characters, I would've liked them a lot more.Arguably the most important element of a great film, the story, is executed with flying colors by this film. From the surprisingly funny comedic writing, to the still very real and mature drama of the film. And also, this film has one of my favorite movie endings, it almost brought a tear to my eye. And the film is also a very quick 90 minutes. My only issue with the story, is the over-reliance on narration. But with writing this good, I can forgive it.In conclusion, 'Mary and Max' is a film that shows animation doesn't necessarily have to be for kids. And this film is one of the best in its respectable genre of film.",7,0,1,23 June 2019
The Matrix," I Don't Get the Level of Praise
","Introduction:
The Matrix is not a bad movie, I think it's okay. It's just that I think the extensive amounts of acclaim and praise this film gets is not entirely deserved. The Matrix is regarded highly by many as a classic in great film making, but I don't agree with that.What I Don't Like:
Now, everybody knows the story of the Matrix. But what makes it so ahead of it's time? As many say. It centers around a chosen one, who lived a simple life at first, but was destined for so much more. It's been done before. And don't tell me it was because of the concept of the Matrix. It was done before. Episodes of Star Trek did it, other movies did it. The concept of a dream world, or computer simulation has been done many times. And if you ask me, they did it better.The Matrix doesn't feel like a deep philosophical film, with great action to go along the way. They're all just dumb action films. The acting is bland, the characters are pretty paper thin, and the film just feels dated. Other films to do this concept, such as what I mentioned, and Inception, had more interesting characters. When one of the most famous line of the movie is, 'Whoa', you have a problem.And also, have you ever noticed the ridiculous amount of plot holes in this film? They are abundant. From the fact the Matrix exists at all. Why would the machines make it so their batteries had a dreamworld? And also smaller stuff, like in the movie, when Neo was called by Morpheus, claiming, 'the phones are tapped', and to meet him at a certain location. Why didn't agents respond to that? You think they pay attention that detail. But no. And just more that don't make any sense, and are demonstration of the bad screenwriting in this film.What I Do Like:
Even though I have a lot of criticism with this film. I don't hate it. The effects are quite good, and while they don't as well as most people claim, they were revolutionary for the time. And there are some smart details, like in the visual style. The fact that everything in the Matrix, has a greenish tint to it, hinting at the fact that they live in a computer. And in old 80's computers, there was a lot of green. And I love little details like that. I also think the action's very nicely shot and well put together. And the Matrix, while dull, is harmless, so I can't call it terrible.Conclusion:
I think the Matrix is personally a very overrated film. It's not bad, I just never got the real appeal. The Matrix doesn't feel like it's doing anything new, or interesting with it's already kind of tired premise. The Matrix is just a film that I think needs to be reevaluated. However, if it still goes down in history as a masterpiece of film, I can't do anything to change that. So, enjoy it if you like it. I just was never able to enjoy on the level of others.",7,2,4,28 June 2019
300," A Zach Snyder Film I Like
","I do not like Zach Snyder's films. Movies such as 'Dawn of the Dead', 'Batman V. Superman' and 'Justice League' are all films I despise. And while enjoyed films like 'Watchmen', and to a degree, 'Man of Steel'. '300' is easily in my opinion, Snyder's best movie.For one thing, the film does a great job being an adaptation of the graphic novel. But the real highlight is the action and visuals. Snyder's visual style is really unique in this film, and you can tell it's from him. The movie is action packed, and the action is stellar, making it a great action film.This is a film that is a little flash over substance, but the substance is still interesting. For one thing, it's historically accurate, portraying the Spartan people very similar to how they actually acted. And while I usually pelt films for being historically inaccurate, I can forgive this, because adapting Frank Miller's book.In conclusion, '300' is a very enjoyable film, and a film I recommend.",6,1,2,6 August 2019
Braveheart," A Little Overrated
","Intro:
Now, Braveheart's fine. I don't hate it. The acting is great, the sets are amazing, the writing is fine. So, why don't I love it? Well, there's one reason. It's down right disrespect for history, as Braveheart follows it so rarely. To the point that it's almost fiction. And I think it's hypocritical when people give this film a pass fir being inaccurate, but when others are just as fictional, it's not very well loved.My Problems:
This film 'adapts' the story of William Wallace, and the Scottish rebellion against the British. Now, even though I consider myself a bit of a history buff, I am not really familiar with this part of history. But I can still tell you that this film doesn't well adapt this story.From the romance that Wallace has with the princess, which never happened, and never could've happened. It wasn't possible. Because when Wallace was running around in the 13th Century fighting for freedom, the princess wasn't even 10 years old. And so many other pointless and inaccuracies plague this film.Another problem is the fact that Scots wore kilts. Which something that wasn't created for another few years. And I'm not the only one who knows this, many people have pointed them out, yet, they still love the film.How come it's okay when this film takes so many 'creative liberties', but it's not okay when other films do it. Here's a good example, Pocahontas is often hated by many and called one of the weakest in the Disney lineup. For it's numerous historical inaccuracies. And if you took away all the names from history, you wouldn't be able to tell the similarities it has to the actual story.And people also don't like some of Mel Gibson's other films, such as, Apocalypto and The Patriot. Apocalypto makes so many mistakes and makes some choices that don't make sense. Let me explain. This film's even worse. The film claims to be a chronicling of the end of the Mayan Classical Era, but it doesn't even stick to that. As the Mayans are depicted doing things other tribes did, such as sacrificing people, which was something the Aztec's did. And the ending to that film, is one of the dumbest endings. Which shows the Spanish arriving over the 100 years before they actually came to the Mayans. And similar problems go for The Patriot.Now that got a little off track there. But do you get my point? The shear hypocrisy that surrounds this film really annoys me.What I Like:
Though I had a lot of criticism, I still don't hate the movie. Why? Well, let me answer. I kind of get it, the film looks great, and mostly recreates the time period. If this story was fictional, I would probably like this film more. But, I think they should've just told the story as it was. To my knowledge, there was more than enough information on the rebellion and William Wallace, to make the epic Mel Gibson imagined. I just think he should've called this an original story, loosely based on the story of William Wallace, or just adapted William Wallace correctly. But, I'm not gonna change a lot of people's opinions on the film.Conclusion:
History will see it as one of the greatest films of all time. If the astonishing 8.4 rating (higher than Citizen Kane), isn't evident enough, I don't know what is. I know that many people do love this film, and I still respect their opinions. And I ask you to respect mine.",4,2,6,28 June 2019
