Antz," the perfect role for Allen
","There was no one who would made the role of Z as well as Woody Allen, I guess because he wrote it.  I liked it a lot, but it wasnÂ´t for children. Adults would enjoy it more than children. If the producers had thought about this, the end of the movie would have been diferent.",9,0,0,11 February 1999
54," buy the soundtrack, don't watch the movie
","54 was made with a good idea in the producer's head, but it didn't work, they looked for the worst director they could ever find, with the worst actor on the principal role, moreover they edited the half of the movie, I only could see little pieces of what the movie should had been at the first. the sceens are not longer than 2 seconds. is a BAD very bad movie. But the movie has on my point of view two good things; the soundtrack, and Mike Myers as Steve Rubell, he really surprised me.",4,0,0,20 February 1999
Schindler's List," Best Holocaust picture ever made

Life Is Beautiful," touching and beautiful
","Here is an example of a great movie, made without millions of dollars, but with a great history, good actors and a particular vision of the second world war. I really enjoyed this movie, it was a big surprise for me to see a different view of an usual theme. and Bellini was charming, not only as an actor,  he put many strongs feelings on this picture as a director too",10,1,2,18 March 1999
The Godfather," excellent
","I never thought it was going to be that good, Al Pacino was just perfect, the way Coppola captures the italian family essence was just amazing, the music made me get into the movie, and although it was so long I did not feel it...one of the best movies I'd ever see",10,0,1,24 October 2000
