The Equalizer," Comedy of the year!
","Alright, so I was dragged to IMAX and had to pay 17 pounds to watch over two hours of headache-inducing visual/sound effects, ridiculously unrealistic characters, logical inconsistencies and a shameless glorification of gore & violence. If you want to use far fetched gore scenes then at least have a plot that can back them upÂ…So its a 7.8/10 huh? Anyone praising this film is either under 15 years old or completely out of his mind. Wont be watching any Denzel Washington flicks anytime soon, shame on a so-called 'established' actor for taking part in such an atrocity. I would give it a zero out 10, seems that IMDb doesn't have such an option tho.",1,96,212,27 September 2014
