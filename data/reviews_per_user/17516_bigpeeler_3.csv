Frost_Nixon," Amazing film. Should be required viewing for students, both film and scholastic.
","I won't wax too long about the film since prior reviewers have stated it's high quality and then some. I remember Richard Nixon, I remember Watergate and I saw the interviews and yet, this film sheds light on things too numerous to mention. Amazingly gripping and paced so well that 2 hours goes by leaving you wanting more.The cast? Absolutely perfect. If Langella doesn't at least garner an Oscar nomination, it will be a travesty. I recall reading that when Hopkins did his Nixon in the self-titled movie, he chose not to do the voice impression that is so well known. As such, he still conveyed the character very well. Langella by contrast, does in fact inflect Nixon's deep, dark tones which he pulls off perfectly. Within seconds, he transforms into the former President and you see and hear no one else for the film's entirety.There is no one in this film that should go unmentioned. Everyone was astounding and they deserve any and all accolades that come their way. Please see this movie. The 'R' rating comes from the simple fact that the subject matter is indeed 'adult' plus there is the odd curse word of which I counted what...3 or 4? I see worse on television.Great movie. 10 out of 10. Seriously.",10,3,7,12 December 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Redefines the word 'bad'.
","What in the heck did I just watch?I love Will Ferrell, so I have no axe to grind in that regard. But I just got back from watching this debacle in a packed theatre and...I'm dumbfounded. This movie transcended bad. Shrouded in a very thin plot, it was nothing more that a staccato string of inane jokes and the sure sign of a crappy movie, a number of surprise cameos.This stunk of one of those 'alum' films where a bunch of actors (and I do use that term loosely here) get together, fill out roster spots and ham it up for the camera. Anyone of these roles could have been played by one of the other actors. And the reason that you saw a 'star' of Christina Applegate's stature in this movie is obviously because no other actress with a shred of dignity would have accepted this script.I laughed out loud one time during this film, and oddly enough, I was the only one. When the announcer is paid off by Ron and he says, 'That was Ron Burgundy and Tits McGee!' I guffawed out loud only to be stared at by those who sat in stone silence around me. The highlight of this movie was the Milk-Dud fight that broke out between two bored teenagers at the front of the cinema.Save your money folks. It'll be at Blockbuster by noon tomorrow.",1,37,76,9 July 2004
Tombstone," One of the best movies I have ever seen, western or not.
","This movie is aces.From beginning to end, it is cinema at it's best. The cast, from stars to the extras are amazing. Please get the DVD and listen to the director's commentary. The little details about the film will endear it to you for life.The story is awesome. I'm not going to go mental as to whether or not it's 100% accurate historically. This is simply a great story.Val Kilmer is killer. Powers Booth gives a stellar performance. Michael Biehn is downright evil personified. Dana Delany is absolutely delicious. My personal favorite in the movie is Ike Clanton, played by the wonderful and underappreciated Stephen Lang.I find myself watching this movie every other week. I simply never tire of it. I have turned more people on to this film than I can count. It has everything from comedy to action to romance.I guarantee that you'll not just like, but love this movie. It is a treasure and will become a classic.'Ain't that a peach?'",10,1,1,4 March 2003
