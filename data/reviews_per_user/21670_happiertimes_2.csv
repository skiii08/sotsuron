Your Name.," I regret watching it.
","Not because it was bad. Because now I have a craving for Anime movies similar in nature to this one, but I can't find any that are truly as well produced as this. There are other good titles for sure, but none of them have touched me quite like this one. I feel like the characters, staring at the sky longing for something that I just can't find.",10,3,4,22 March 2018
Warcraft," I was expecting more...
","Don't take my review as a reason not to go see it honestly. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because while the movie itself is lacking the visuals are indeed incredible in my opinion.I gave it such a low rating because it's like playing Warlords of Draenor all over again, the hype far surpassed my expectations of what I would be receiving. In any case my biggest concerns for this movie were that it was extremely clunky, it's like the story couldn't follow a line and you jumped all over the place giving it a very...empty feeling. It's not to be said either that Blizzard can't tell a fascinating story. For any of you Blizzard fans who haven't check out the short series they've done for Overwatch characters, a stunning example of their capabilities in just a few 5-10min clips.I feel like most people are simply rating this high because they were impressed by the graphics and ignored all the other lacking features, because the battle scenes I have to admit were nice to watch. However I believe the biggest reason this is rated so high is because they've never actually played a game/know the lore.TL:DR If you've played the games at all, I feel you'll most likely be disappointed more than someone who's never played anything who would most give this 8-10stars. I did cry at the end though, not because of the movie but for the fact I had to pay 60$ for me and my girl to go see it in I-max with snacks.",2,46,118,27 May 2016
