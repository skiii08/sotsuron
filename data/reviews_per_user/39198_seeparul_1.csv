Requiem for a Dream," There are movies and then there's this!
","If there was a way that this movie could be made mandatory for all teenagers to watch, drug abuse might go down on the list of problems.Very few pieces of work can move you enough to implement excerpts of it in your life. When we make choices, we subconsciously assess everything that we have gone through in life. And if a movie has the power to influence those choices, it's got to be beyond just a piece of art. I believe anyone who has watched this film cannot do drugs without remembering Harry's amputation or Sara's hallucinations or even Marion's desperation, no matter what choice they finally make! It makes you stop and think.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and it reinstates the fact that media has incredible power if used correctly. It obviously does not have commercial appeal but it has solid impact. Highly recommended.",10,1,2,14 February 2012
