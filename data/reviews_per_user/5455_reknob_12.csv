The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," They're getting worse
","I liked the first film (8/10), thought the second film was very average (6/10) and this is a generous 5/10.There's no point going into detail but suffice to say that everything here is very weak indeed and I felt sorry for the great Jenny Lawrence trying her best with this appalling non-script that persists in suggesting that her character could have any feelings towards the pipsqueak Peter character .It's just not a believable romantic thread ...Jenny and Julianne could both find better work than this. Very poor indeed ...",5,8,11,8 March 2015
The Hateful Eight," Typical QT frustrating stuff
","As always, there's good stuff here from QT but yet again, his indiscipline and self-indulgence drag this down to a 7 for me.QT is an undoubtedly capable writer but he is constantly let down with both the editing and what seems to be weak direction with respect to forcing his actors to deliver in a particular manner.Top of that list, I'm afraid, is Samuel L. Jackson who despite a generally good performance here, looks and sounds like he's just stepped out of 90's Compton and while that's always a problem for me in all his roles, it's all the more jarring in a period setting like this where all the other actors are delivering appropriate accents and mannerisms.As for the other actors, they are uniformly terrific. Kurt Russell is always good value and I was delighted to see Bruce Dern here still showing he's got the acting chops and then some. Special mention should also go to Jennifer Jason Leigh who I thought led the bunch with QT quite clearly pushing her towards an Exorcist looking appearance - she was superb I thought and I could push her for a Best Supporting Actress nod here ...I gather there's some fuss about the usage of the 'N' word here and while I think that's certainly an issue in the past, I don't have any problems with it in this setting. It's just post-Civil War for crying out loud and given the characters, it would seem inappropriate for that word *not* to be flung around all the time. Unfortunately, the issue I do have with it, and the 'MF' word is that yet again, Samuel L. Jackson is involved and I'm starting to have problems remembering a film where he *didn't* fling those words around all the time and it has become very, very off-putting for me and absolutely stops me from seeing him as anything else but Samuel L. Jackson, the guy who will look and sound the same in every film and you can bet your bottom Dollar that he'll be saying 'N' and 'MF' a lot, even if a film is set in 11th Century England ...Clearly, the guy is doing well in terms of making money and getting into decent productions but I for one started avoiding his 'work' some years ago because he ruins everything he's in for me - he's the black Keanu Reeves - I only managed to see this because of the amount of spare time I have over Xmas, otherwise I would have ducked it like all his other films ...All in all, this is worth a watch but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it ...Here's hoping that QT will, eventually, get a grip on himself and start making films that hit everyone in the right spot, not just himself and, presumably, his large gang of 20-something fans ...",7,2,16,2 January 2016
Interstellar," Awful
","I'm supposed to detail my thoughts on the movie here but frankly, I don't know where to begin.There's just so much wrong here that I can't prioritise it all but here goes: Sound: Horrible, horrible noise throughout the film rendering much of the dialogue unintelligible. What on earth were they thinking? Acting: I love McConaughey and he does his best to instil some emotion in here to make up for the total 'care?' engendered by the pitiful script but he can't do it all on his own and the female lead with the I'm-so-cute big eyes was dreadful throughout.Writing/screenplay: Well, again, I don't know where to begin but as with most poor movies, this is the real culprit here. I'm just not sure at which point I was supposed to actually give a toss about any of the characters or get caught up in what was happening on screen.For a film set in inter-galactic travel, the suggestion is that the sum total of wild and whacky differences between worlds other than ours is that they may have big waves in their seas or it may be really cold. OK, colour my imagination fully filled lol, Jesus wept, that's it? That's the grand vision of the other side of the universe fulfilled is it? Again, this is supposed to be a story of big ideas and concepts so why do we have to sit through half an hour plus of setting up an utterly superfluous bad guy replete with pointless (and hysterically funny - to me at least) fight between guys in space suits? What, if any, was the point of all of that? True or false, this would be a better film with all of the Matt Damon stuff taken out and indeed that entire planet's involvement - mindboggling.I'm not even going to go there on the pseudo-science. I'm a sci-fi fan and I'm happy to let my imagination run to keep myself in the story but you've got to make at least some effort. The complete cr*p coming out of the actor's mouths in much of this film was just embarrassing, so bloody low brow, I imagine the more intelligent amongst them must have had trouble keeping a straight face at times.I haven't had the misfortune to suffer through such atrocious writing since Prometheus and clearly, Nolan is well on the way to becoming the new Ridley Scott. Good with smaller budget films where he may actually put a shift in but appalling when larging it around with big budget 'blockbusters' sh*te like these - what a complete and utter waste of time, money and talent on films that nobody is ever going to watch again ...Dreadful.",5,3,5,11 March 2015
American Hustle," 6-8/10 depending on your mood/intoxication levels
","This is an exceptionally difficult film to score - there's lots to like here and lots to loathe.Arguably, the same could be said for Wolf of Wall Street except the editing here, though not great, isn't up to the tragedy level of WoWS (did they cut *anything* from that film???) so there's still stuff in here that coulda/shoulda been cut or improved.The script, like the acting and the direction is both good and bad at times and how much you are affected by the good/bad on offer here will be totally down to personal sensitivities and will make this either a completely ordinary or a reasonably entertaining experience for you.For me, both Cooper and Bale were outshone by their female counterparts - Cooper I found intensely irritating throughout - Bale's role is by necessity less showy but it's a mixed performance for me with elements of his Patrick Bateman performance showing through all the extra hair, makeup and glasses etc.Amy Adams is extremely sexy to be sure but the director spends so much time luxuriating over her body (and for some reason her legs and feet - perhaps he shares my fetish ...) that anything that may be notable about her performance was lost to me.The real acting kudos here goes to Jennifer Lawrence who I think stood out in almost every scene she was in and I'll be looking out for her future work ...All in all, this is worth a view but you probably want to leave your brain at the entrance and pick it back up on the way out ...Like many 'big' films recently, the general standard of how well the film was *crafted* seems to have slumped to levels I've not seen since the late 1970s.This is something I've witnessed in films like Gatsby(what the hell?? Awful!!), Wolf of Wall Street (45 minutes of worthy stuff stretched out for three hours) and 12 Years a Slave (decent but massively over-hyped with a weak script) - is it all getting just a bit too easy for folks up in Hollywood these days cos someone, somewhere, sitting atop this stuff is falling short in their duty imo ...",7,0,2,26 January 2014
Man of Steel," Religion + politics = politics
","I was reminded of the above quote whilst watching Man of Steel.TV (actors/writers/directors) + movie = TV. Or at best, a 'B' movie.With a budget of $225m you have to think that $200m of that was spent on the CGI leaving $25m to write, direct, edit, and act out a 'movie'.Respect to Ben Affleck who turned down directing the film: 'A lesson I've learned is to not look at movies based on budget, how much they'll spend on effects or where they will shoot. Story is what's important.'There are things to like in this for sure, assuming you're a Superman fanboy and/or 12 years old that is but in terms of the standards (barely kept these days ...) of writing, acting, directing and editing (was there any???) required to make a real movie it's actually quite embarrassing to watch, incohesive and, frankly, boring for long periods - how many fight scenes between indestructible characters can you have in one movie for God's sake??!!It's also somewhat stupefying to believe that it actually made it to the big screen - 20 years ago this would most definitely have been a 'straight to video' release and it ranks up there with recent gobsmackingly poor efforts such as The Great Gatsby and Trance.While I can understand the cast of TV actors wanting a part in this to get themselves onto the big screen alongside the likes of (the *incredibly* overrated) Russell Crowe, you do have to wonder just how much benefit their careers will get from being involved in such a poorly executed project - for sure they'll have made a few quid but none of these guys are short of cash anyway I wouldn't have thought!Whilst Henry Cavill can be forgiven for taking the opportunity to land a 'big lead', I'm staggered that someone of the calibre of Richard Schiff would get involved in something like this - was there even a script ahead of signing these people up??!! Oh and don't even get me started on I'm-so-fat-I-can't-even-run-anymore Fishburne lolWhile I've been delighted to see the standards of TV dramas rocket in the past decade or so, almost to the point of good movie making standards, this type of travesty is a clear indication that there are clear limits to what can be achieved when attempting to merge the two formats.This felt like an attempt to cram a season or two of a typical TV series into a (impossible to justify given the 'content') 2 and a half hour movie.What's quite telling is that in the effort to use TV standards to make a movie, this has actually not only fallen way short of being a viable movie but it also pales next to the plethora of quality TV dramas we've been treated to recently.On that basis, I can only hope that this attempt to merge the two formats (ala games and movies anyone??) will quickly die away and we can continue with, the very occasional, great modern movie and more terrific TV dramas but on this evidence, never the twain shall meet!",4,3,7,23 November 2013
The Revenant," Wow!
","Every once in a while (about twice per decade, at best, I'd suggest) a film comes along that within the first few minutes you're thinking to yourself 'I don't want this to end ...' and this is one of those oh-so-rare productions - absolutely magnificent in every respect.It will for sure be a love/hate film for the wider audience (this most certainly ain't a rom-com girls so ...) and the stupids will doubtless be very, very bored after the first half an hour but if you like 'proper' films and appreciate cinematography and top-notch acting in a gritty and (very) grim context then this is for you.As the other guy suggests - stop reading this, go put your hand in your pockets and pay to go see it where it should be seen on a big screen at the cinema; this is one of those twice-per-decade films that *must* be seen that way ...Big respect and thanks go to all concerned with making this cinematic triumph.",9,3,11,31 December 2015
Sicario," Who gave this the green light??
","This is an 8/10 film dragged down to a 5/10 by the inclusion of Emily Blunt's 'character' in the screenplay.I have no understanding whatsoever what the execs/director/writer were thinking when including her whiny-ass, *unbelievably* naïve character in this otherwise really good film but boy did they trash it by her inclusion.Notwithstanding the amount of disbelief suspension required to think she could ever be a FBI/SWAT team member (never mind leader!!) with her 90lbs frame but she goes one further by doing things like checking a dead guy for a pulse with her leather gloves still on (two minutes into the film!) just to ensure that your jaw slacks open at the seeming incongruousness of all the good things you've heard about this film vs her character (stick thin female/pointless and distracting character) contributing absolutely nothing to it and she's in your face throughout the film - mindboggling ...Take her out of it and add a few more minutes with the rest of the cast and you're onto a winner cos the rest of it is just great, cinematography and direction in particular but well, I don't know what else to say ...I'm not hating on Blunt cos her performance is fine but she should never have made it past the first draft of this write-up; there's just zero interest here in her character and you just have to think that it's just yet another example of Hollywood's obsession with squeezing in a female character (almost always to the detriment of everything else) to satisfy the focus groups/wtf-ever but that's usually a token 'supporting' (LOL!) character, not the ostensible lead in a film ...This is a film that should never have had a lead cos the story *is* the lead - Blunt appears to have been tacked on as an afterthought and ultimately it trashes what could have been a well made film with a great cast ...A real shame and yet more evidence of some staggeringly inept writing decisions coming out of Hollywood these days ...",5,7,17,27 December 2015
12 Years a Slave," Colour me underwhelmed
","There are things to like here for sure but I doubt this rates in my top three all-time black slavery movies ...A stellar cast but mediocre screenplay/script leave this as an average watch and I'm not sure what this adds to the (ever increasing) back catalogue of black slavery movies ...The main problem for me I think is that Patsey (a young female black slave who is whipped to within an inch of her life and repeatedly sexually assaulted by her owner and then picked on/assaulted by the owner's jealous wife, again, repeatedly) goes through 1000x more pain, humiliation and suffering than the main character does and she's left behind for more of the same no doubt until her dying day whilst he's back in New York having been freed to go back to his spoilt bunny lifestyle - where's the narrative drama there? All I cared about was Patsey who he, apparently, left to suffer until her dying day even after she begged him to kill her ...PS: Brad Pitt's role towards the end of the movie was really offputting - sorry Brad but you can't be who/what you are and just turn up at the end of the film and not expect to throw the whole thing off-kilter, Fassbender must have been really p*ssed cos there's really no point even trying to do anything with your own performance if you're then going to roll in at the end with your Quaker beard and being Brad Pitt n all and tossing the audience's immersion out of the window - you're like one step away from being Troy McLure my friend, even if you are 'producing' the movie ...",6,4,7,11 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Oh dear
","WoWS, along with 12 Years, is hugely overrated and quite clearly is simply a poor man's 'Goodfellas in Wall Street' - there's simply no narrative arc here at all, did they even leave a single shot on the editing room floor to get this to three hours??? Massively bloated, zero narrative tension, embarrassingly rip-off style to Goodfellas - good performance from Di Caprio of course who is a fine actor though this must be his 19th film on the trot playing some rich guy; seriously Leo, you need to start picking scripts ala Clooney cos you're chucking away what could be a fine career on *pointless* stuff such as WoWS and the awful Gatsby ...5/10 - nothing in it to hate but hardly anything in it to really like (other than lots and lots and lots of T&A and drug taking but you can't have a film consisting of that and virtually nothing else and WoWS proves it ...).",5,6,12,19 January 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," An absolute treat
","I loved this from start to finish.Hardly your typical cinema fare, this will leave much of the average cinema goer bored I would imagine.Simply put, if you enjoy the theatre then you will almost certainly love this, not just because it's set in a theatre but because that dividing line of demographics is more or less accurate in terms of who will lover/hate this work ...I can't recommend this highly enough and how about the length of some of those shots?!Top work.",9,3,8,9 March 2015
Prometheus," RIP Ridley Scott the film maker
","I shan't compare this to other 'Alien' movies because, frankly, I think it's irrelevant.I shall, however, judge it as a film on its own merits.This is a very, very poorly made film.The narrative arc (is there one??)/script are wholly lacking, there are GAPING holes left all over the place such that quality actors have to deliver CRINGEWORTHY exposition lines to let you know what the hell is going on. Nor is there any sense of discovery here at all which is absolutely criminal given the synopsis. The pacing, or lack of it, never once let's you settle into any kind of immersive atmosphere, save perhaps for the first 30 minutes or so.Fassbender (especially) and Rapace are the standouts here, everyone else would have served the film better if they had simply not turned up for shooting so they could be scrubbed from the 'script'. I'm not having a go at the supporting actors as they can only work with what they've been given but honestly, there are quality actors here having to deliver truly embarrassing work.Are there good things here? Yes, visually, at times, it is stunning although the too-fast pacing often sees incredible imagery on screen for painfully short periods crushing your immersion. Also, the one stand-out scene left me reeling and bonding with Rapace's character - the only time I felt tension and horror during the entire film. The first thirty minutes or so are spell-binding including the introduction to Fassbender's character who we see watching a legendary movie (also a personal favourite of mine and one in which the main character is also on a journey of self-discovery).However, from thirty minutes in, it's all downhill.I cannot for the life of me understand how Ridley Scott let this film get away from him so badly.Scott made his name with his first three films, showing stupendous ability at creating immersive atmospheres with exquisite attention to detail - The duellists, Alien and Bladerunner. These are films that I watch at least twice per year.The fact that he since went down the Hollywood blockbuster route has been of constant disappointment to me. While he likely ballooned his own net worth, in my opinion he has created nothing of much worth for anybody else since, certainly nothing towards the art of film making. OK, so he went for money and ego instead of craft and art, it's his life and his choice but I never thought that he would treat a legacy such as Alien with such consummate disrespect - this is shameful work from someone who, at least used to be, capable of so much more ...I would like to think that this film was destroyed in the editing room and that there's 20 minutes or so of 'extra' narrative-laden material that was dumped for the oh-so-superfluous 'action' scenes that made it to the final cut. Swap those in on a Bluray Director's Cut (sic) and maybe this can be lifted from its theatrical release level of shame ...",4,28,55,3 June 2012
The Martian," Ridley Scott does it again!
","This is woeful ...Appalling 'script', no direction, incredible comedy casting, zero narrative tension - everything I've come to expect from a Ridley Scott 'production' over the past decade ...What on earth this guy is thinking and what people are seeing in his output I just do not know ...A complete and utter waste of time - I'd be embarrassed to be involved with this and surely to God the talent that was involved in this latest wasterpiece of Ridley's will be steering clear of him in the future, it all beggars belief it really does ...",4,3,5,6 February 2016
