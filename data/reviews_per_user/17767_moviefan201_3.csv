Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates- Ahoy, another nice addition but not the best
","Pirates 4 was a good movie but not as excellent as the rest. It focused to much on the town adventure rather than the journey. It lacked in excitement, with little dialog to work with, the action wasn't as big and fast paced as the other films. The missing presence of Kiera and Orlando was well noticed , but the new couple helped this but did not fully develop throughout the film as it was open-ended and left audiences wondering what there fate was... Johnny and Penelope did a great job, black beard was an okay villain but lacked a menacing feel compared to Davy Jones.. Overall a nice addition to the franchise but not the best, 7/10",7,0,0,7 June 2011
Thor," Excellent Superhero Adaption!
","This film was quite surprising, i wanted to see the film but the trailers did not make is seem anything spectacular but after seeing this film i can safely say it was Spectacular!. Another great adaption of a marvel comic hero. The film starts of interesting and delivers right through, the actors who played there roles did a superb job esp Chris Hemsworth as Thor & Natalie Portman's role.. We follow Thor's journey to return to his kingdom and prove he is worthy after his selfish ways that left him on earth, he finds a different world he did not know and this develops him into a loyal hero. The action throughout the film was great with some great effects and CGI, it delivered some great comedy (notably the coffe scene). It was left open ended and left audiences wanting more to see what happens next.. there is also a after credit scene that again leaves unanswered questions which should be answered in the next film. Overall a excellent movie and a great addition to the marvel superhero franchise. 8/10",8,4,8,11 June 2011
X-Men: First Class," X-men first class has the X-Factor
","X-men First Class delivers the x factor, it is the best since X3 Best out of the xmen series action balanced with dialog, not as action packed as the rest but focuses more on storyline and character development which makes this film a stand-out film, the soundtrack was excellent for this film with great visual effects. The actors did a excellent job particularly Professer X, Magneto and Mystique It gives a great look at the back stories of these character if your a xmen fan and if not it has enough to keep you entertained. It also contains some surprises with cameos from other xmen films, a notably humorous one is the stand out of cameos . Anyway i recommend to see this film in theaters to gain the full experience, it is definitely worth the watch.",9,1,3,7 June 2011
