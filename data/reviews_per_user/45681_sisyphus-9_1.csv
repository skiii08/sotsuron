The Blair Witch Project," BWP is scary as hell as long as you let your imagination go with the story
",I think many posters are missing the point.  Sure this isn't a Halloween type movie with things jumping in your face.  If you see this with an open mind and buy into the premise than it is one majorly creepy movie.  There were problems and I think they could have made it scarier if we could have seen some glimpse of what was out in the woods.  But my imagination was running wild and the ending was extremely intense.,Null,1,1,27 July 1999
