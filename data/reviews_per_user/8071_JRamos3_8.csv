Casablanca," Wow
","So, like my summary would suggest, all I can truly say about this film is wow. While that is certainly not very articulate, that was the initial feeling I had after watching this film. Everything about this film, the unique location, plot, scenery, and outstanding performances worked in conjunction to make this film great. Obviously Humphrey Bogart stood alone in his portrayal of American freedom fighter/idealist turned bar owner, Rick Blaine. The little nuances he is able to bring to the character turned Rick from just another person on the screen to one that I could not take my eyes off of. In addition, and this is the one thing that really made the film great, was the comedy. It goes without saying that World War II and the horrors that accompanied it are nothing to take lightly; however, this film was genuinely funny almost all the way through. For instance, in the scene where the young couple approached the French officer Louis, and says they will be at his office at six, and he in turn replies,' OK, i will be there at ten.' I mean, come on, to be able to interject such a humorous tone into a film that deals with issues of considerable weight is nothing short of great. Another aspect of the film that is particularly worth mention is the somewhat cheesy, but necessary love story, for it allows the audience to experience the full range and emotions of the actors character development. As a viewer, you feel for Elsa and Lazlo, even though Rick is obviously the first choice for Elsa's affection. Moreover, it is this same 'cheesy' love that allows Rick to make the necessary sacrifice of allowing Lazlo and Elsa to escape to Lisbon with the documents they had so severely coveted. If Rick were a man of lesser character or measure, he could have simply withheld the documents and let the chips fall where they may, so to speak. Lastly, the films overall feel is superb. As I stated earlier, the unique choice of location, the sets, and hegemony between all of the characters, french, German, and others, makes for an excellent viewing experience. I had only previously heard of this film and how good it was, but I am glad that now I have had the experience firsthand. I definitely recommend this film.",Null,0,1,13 October 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," A perfect adaption of literary genius
","Where to even begin? I watched this film for a history of cinema class, and I have to say that all of the films I have viewed of late, this one is by far the best to date. All the performances are stellar, obviously to include Henry Fonda's Oscar nominated performance as the films main character, Tom Joad. While I have never read Steinbeck's novel of the same title, after viewing this film i will certainly put it on my to do list. This film seems, almost effortlessly, to perfectly capture and showcase the harsh conditions of the 1930's during the dust-bowl. Many aspects of this film were extremely well done and worth mentioning. The outstanding performances of the actors aside, the scenery, story telling, and overall misc-en-sene of the film is great. At no point did this film fail to keep my interest, as the characters in the story, although clearly in no way similar to my personal life's story, are truly relate able to the audience. As a viewer, you feel for the plight of the Joad family on their endless journey just to find work and some small semblance of creature comfort. Additionally, the harsh and severe treatment that the travelers as a whole experience at the hands of both law enforcement and local farm security made me nothing short of incensed. To be sure, during the scene in which Tom's friend is killed on the river, I found myself almost in shock, for I did not in any way see that action on the horizon. However, I think it , the killing and general treatment of the migrants that is, stands as a testament to what life must have truly been like at that dark time in American history. Furthermore, the fact that such blatantly gross abuse of power was allowed to persist speaks volumes to the wanton disregard that so many must have had for those that were unemployed. This is truly sad when you think about it; Most of the families that were traveling hundreds upon hundreds of miles at the cost of even further famine and illness only wanted work and some food to eat, and were met with admonishment and disregard. That is truly appalling. But I digress. The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent film that in its time served as a call to action for all those who wished to take a stand against the abuse and mistreatment of others. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and would recommend it to others wishing to glean some knowledge about a oft-forgot time in American History.",Null,1,2,9 October 2011
The Exorcist," Still scary after all this time.....
","Like the title says, this film still possesses the innate ability to scare me half to death. That is saying something considering I am a grown man that has been to war, twice. Everything about the film is designed to make the viewer feel uneasy. Even the opening,which granted the film was made in 1973 and war with the middle east was unforeseeable, makes viewers uneasy with the call to prayer blaring in Arabic. The whole film is superbly shot and choreographed, with special kudo's going to the lighting directors and cinematographers for their excellent use of contrasting shadows to both hide and reveal things. The performances in the film are obviously among the best there have ever been and little needs to be said about them that has nor been said by critics in the past. Ellen Burstyn's performance as the socialite mother with a problem that can not be solved by throwing money at it rings true to what I would imagine any parent would do if faced with a similar situation. Likewise, Max Von Sydow is nothing short of the best in his role as Father Merrin. I mean, I was fraked out just watching the film at home, I would imagine that being in the room with all that stuff going on ( its a movie, I know) would still be very disconcerting. I think the reason that this film has stood the test of time the way it has is because, deep down, we are all afraid of something terrible happening to us that is completely and utterly out the realm of our control. There is nothing more frightening than that to me. I said all that to say this, this film is excellent, it scared me like I have not been scared in a long time, and if you have not seen it, you are doing a true disservice to yourself.",Null,1,2,13 December 2011
The Graduate," Interesting
","Dustin Hoffman's performance in this film is top notch in both comedy and drama. As Ben, he is able to bring a sense of vulnerability to the character that might have otherwise been lost by a different actor. That being said, the entire cast is pretty great, with a solid job done all around. Technically the film is great as well. There are a lot of really interesting camera tricks done to make the film the masterpiece it is. For example, the framing scene in the beginning of the movie, where Ben is only visible through the triangle formed by Mrs. Robinsons leg is a particularly well-done. Another example would include the graphic match cut when Ben is in the pool and then in bed with Mrs. Robinson. This film delivers on all platforms, both technically and in form and content. The plot left a little something to be desired in my opinion, as it seems that there is no real explanation of certain events, i.e. Ben;s decision to marry Elaine. It just kind of happens out of nowhere and the audience has to go along with it. I think in a way that there is a message in there about the disconnect among older and younger generations with the inherent message being that the younger generation is going to live the way it wants and damn anyone who tried to stop them. Conversely, this also says something about the sense of rigidity with which the older generation live their own lives. This all serves to accentuate the 'generation gap' theory that became so much a part of 'new Hollywood' films during that period. The one part of the film that I did enjoy a lot, not to suggest that I did not enjoy the rest of it, is the end. I genuinely liked the fact that both Ben and Elaine have the epiphany or realization that life is not all happy and that rough times await. It is a nice break from the typical happy ending that most would expect. I would definitely recommend this film both because of how visually pleasing it is, but also for the powerful message it delivers.",Null,0,0,2 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Great..
","This film was certainly not my first foray into the realm of musicals, but it is easy to see why this film garnered such critical acclaim upon its release. Everything aspect of this film is top notch. The fact that it is a musical that plays on the first sound films being released and the whole slew of trouble that ensued makes it even better. This brings me to my next point, humor. This film is genuinely funny, and not just as a student, but as a viewer as well. The writing is sharp and witty, albeit a bit sentimental for my taste. From the films opening scene on the red carpet, as a viewer there is no mistaking that this movie is going to be great. Gene Kelly's acting, singing, and of course dancing, is superb to say the least, and is made even better by the cast around him. The music in the film was a bit slow for my taste, but it is understandable considering this film is supposed to be set in the 1920's. I feel as though there is not much I can say that has not been said already by many others about what a high caliber film this is. Jean Hagen as the nasally and pompous Lina Lemont made me want to cringe every time she entered the scene. While I understand that it is a movie, nonetheless, I can't imagine that role did not stick with her for a while. What I mean to say is, I'm sure that people berated her on the street because of her performance. But I digress.. The overall feel, or mis-en-scene of the film is great, from the costumes to the set and production design, all the way down to the minor details like the microphones in the flower pot. It just goes to show that something as simple as sound in films, which assuredly we all take for granted every day, had at best, rocky beginnings to get to the point where it is today. Not to sound overly clichÃ©, but this film is a timeless classic that I would highly recommend to others.",Null,0,1,8 November 2011
Psycho," Hitchcock at his finest
","Up until a few days ago, the only version of this film I had seen was the contemporary version with Vince Vaughn. That being said, after viewing this original, and obviously much better version, it is safe to say that Hitchcock would roll over in his grave if he could see what his work had become. This film,(the original) is a stunning piece of visual and visceral beauty. It deals with a myriad of issues that affect the human condition, namely greed, love,psychosis, and fear, just to name a few. This film, more than being a first rate horror movie, is at its core, a story about people. Granted, in this instance, we are talking about some truly screwed up people, but people none the less. The film had a gritty, intense feeling, yet a smooth and refined look. Those two contrasting elements went a long way to truly sucking the viewer into what he or she was watching. Additionally, the music was downright eerie; this was so much the case that when I was viewing the movie at home, I paused it to turn on more lights in my house. That music just had some supernatural way of sending chills down my spine. For the characters themselves, Perkind does what one could expect him to do when tasked with such a mentally taxing role, he shines. Perkins plays the part of Norman Bates very well, as does he Norman's mother. Janet Leigh also brings a strong presence to the screen in her role of the misguided heroine. If I had one major critique of this film, it would be that it ended almost too abruptly. There is this slow creeping buildup to the action, to Bates having a showdown at the climax, and then, poof, its over. Norman is jail, clearly still crazy, and thats that. I would have liked to have seen a little more in that realm. Understandably, Hitchcock was a particular man who believed in less being more, but I feel that way all the same. In regards to Hitchcock, not much needs to really be said. This film is cinematic genius that has yet to be rivaled in terms of cinematography and overall mis-en-scene. Everything is modern, yet still very creepy. That is an especially nice touch. So in summation, Hitchcock and his cast delivered a stellar film that I would definitely recommend to any fan of horror films.",Null,0,0,8 November 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Where to begin?
","So, like my title would suggest, I Am having a difficult time figuring out where to begin with a review/comment about this film. I do not wish to reiterate all the same old things about how great it is, how it won the four major Oscars ( Picture, Direcotr, Actor/Actress), and how life changing it was. Please don't mistake the tone of this for cynicism, because it most certainly is not. I think the reason I am having so much trouble is because what can one person even say about this film? Seriously. Obviously from a technical standpoint the film is first rate. There is no doubt about that. The use of long takes, the gloomy feeling that the director and cinematographer bring to the ward all make for the feeling like something is crawling under your skin.. It is pretty creepy. But then, enter McMurphy (Nicholson), with his rebellious, wise-cracking ways, the I am smarter than you and I know it attitude, and the film turns comical. I did enjoy that part of it, the comedy that is. What I did not enjoy was the ending of the film. A lobotomy, really? The part that bothered me the most about the ending was not the film itself, but the fact that this film was only a small glimpse ( however artistically licensed) into the tragic world of life in mental health care facilities across the country at that time. What the hell were we (people in general) thinking? The electric chair is used to end someone's life, but a small dose for someone who is already clearly defective is OK? Really? That scene is probably one of the most memorable in the film next to the chief's escape and the party scene. The form and content of the film are excellent, as are all the technical aspects. The story moves along at a good speed, something often difficult to achieve in a movie with such a enclosed setting. The lighting is especially effective and the set design/ costumes all ring true for the time. it is very easy to see how both Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher attained their Oscar's, as both performances are some of the best I have ever seen. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who wanted to see Jack at his finest as well as peer into the terrible world of the mentally ill.",Null,0,1,13 December 2011
Saboteur," First Hitchcock Film
","So, like my title states, this was my first foray in the often macabre world of Alfred Hitchcock. I had previously seen bits and pieces of films like psycho, or the birds, but had never actually sat down and watched a Hitchcock film start to finish. If I only knew what I was missing. Everything about this film was great, the story, the misc-en-scene, the wealth of creative and interesting characters, as well as the subtle undertones of patriotism, or lack thereof. First is the story. Hitchcock wastes no time throwing the viewer right into the meat of the story, as the film's inciting incident, the death at the airplane factory, happens in the first five or so minutes of the film. From there, things only get better for the viewer, albeit much worse for the film's lead character. For me, two of the more enjoyable aspects of the film's plot came during the scene when Pat and Barry encounter the traveling circus. This scene is not only memorable for its obviously distinct characters, but also for the lessons that they impart on Pat and Barry. For instance, learning not to judge people, and giving everyone, regardless of their situation, a fair chance. Secondly, the scene with the blind man was also excellent because of the use of well placed lighting, music, as well as the twist at the end of the scene when the blind man reveals that he was aware of Barry's handcuff's all along. Just superb. From there, the film only gets better. Though the film is essentially designed as a mystery/ suspense film, there were several parts that were genuinely funny. While Hitchcock might not have meant this to be the case, I thought the scene during Mrs. Sutton's ball was funny as well as vital to the plot. Additonally, the film touches on notions of patriotism and what people will do to meet their own ends. That aspect of the film, that is to say, the anti-patriotic parts, are what really struck a chord with me seeing as how this film was released shortly after America's entry into World War II. Finally, the overall look and feel of the film is great. I was taken aback but the scene early on in which the smoke from the factory fire begins to slowly billow in. I was floored by how visually arresting Hitchcock manages to make something as simple as smoke look stunning in the greater sense of the film. Overall, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone.",Null,1,2,26 October 2011
