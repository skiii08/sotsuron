Ford v Ferrari," Great Movie even if you don't like cars
","Ford vs Ferrari is a movie based on a true story in the 60's. the movie setting was realistic because it was settle. Matt Damon and Christian Bale give brilliant performances, and what gives this movie the love it deserves. the movie covered sales and marketing so well it wasn't boring. The movie shows ken miles as a likable character even if ford didn't like him. Matt Damon role is just as good as Bales. it was",10,2,5,23 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Underated
","Dont think of this movie as what you have been watching these movies for. In the prequels they defeated the sepretists, in the originals they defeated the empire, and in the disney sequels they defeated the first order. This movie should be thought of the end of a trilogy instead of 9 movies. After that its a great movie with great surprises and good character moves",9,8,26,28 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Good Movie Overall
","This a good movie with overall great acting from everyone. Leonardo brings a excellent acting performance no surprise, being able to play a cheesy actor in 1960 is fantastic. The movie benefits from this. Tarantino is a great director and you can see some of the Tarantino formula here, including feet. i didn't like the portrayal of woman in this movie being careless and messy. Margot Robbie was wasted with her talent. The ending act was easily the best part of the movie although alternating the past. in the end Brad Pitt takes acid and is out of his mind high while dealing with assault and a tense situation. the end is equipped with the Tarantino violence. In the end you should give this movie a look at this is a movie with not a great plot but is not looked at because of the great performances from the two leads.",8,2,5,23 January 2020
1917," One of the best war movie of the 2000's
","1917 is a masterpiece with Sam Mendes skill. The movie is shot so well it brought you to world war one. the acting from the two leads is fantastic, bringing realism and drama to the war it felt like a very detailed documentary. The story is realistic and simple. the movie is 2 hours long feeling like you went on the mission with Blake and Scholfeld. If you like movies you should see this. 1917 might be a new step in cinema.",8,0,4,23 January 2020
Joker," A great suspenseful movie
","This movie is very well done, by showing the dramatic fall of a mentally ill man. I only have 1 small problem and that is not because the movie, joker has never had a backstory in the comics so making this movie made me a bit curious, but it came out amazing. everything was gritty and Todd Phillips showed a perfect representation of Gotham. Joaquin Phoenix carries the movie so much. Also the soundtrack was great.",8,2,5,23 January 2020
