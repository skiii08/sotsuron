The New World," did the job for me
","i know it's cool to hate a film that colin farrell stars in, but i had to like the new world. for one, it's malick, and you can hate all you want, but he makes his owns movies and, if you don't like them, then you're just not patient enough. the bottom line is that movies need to do a couple of things for an audience. they need to entertain--i thought the storyline was fine here. they need to take you to another place--it did. never did it talk down to me, never did it look pitiful, never did it insult my intelligence. history buffs, puh-leeze, it's a movie with some peruvian fifteen-year-old playing pocahontas. deal with it. i hope my four-year old son will appreciate the storytelling of malick, who, despite people on the message boards, peaked with days of heaven, but still has some tricks up his sleeve. this movie did poorly at the box office, but i think it deserves a chance.",8,0,1,26 June 2008
Insomnia," poor christoper nolan
","i feel bad for christopher nolan, the director. he comes off the heels of mememto, which people may not have seen in the theater, but have gotten around to watching on dvd.  he not only gets good previous material here, but a budget and 3 oscar winners in the actor and actress categories. i won't give anything away.  there is only one thing a viewer of this film should do--rent the original (or watch it on ifc).  someone stepped in on nolan's film and made it too polite, without much risk. al pacino's character, dormer, is the one we must follow throughout the film.  in EVERY case in this film, i felt his character was justified in his actions.  unfortunately, his actions are a source of suspense and plot revelation in the film, but with little conflict (we know who did it from the COMMERCIALS) the story needs some internal conflict or character flaw to make it more interesting.  should he have done this?  should he have done that?  well, yes.  move along. i don't understand why everything has to be tidy at the end.  there is no thought process going on in a viewer's mind once the credits roll--that is all taken care of for us.  any question you might ask is moot by the finale. and that's sad.  anything that was sexual, mildly perverse, or disturbing was taken out of the original and sanitized to make a cleaner, more 'psychological' film. nolan does nothing wrong here.  he adds clever flashbacks to make an old storyline juxtapose a newer one.  you'll see--it's something similar to what he did in memento, and it works again here.  the guy is 31 years old, has done three films.  i look forward to his next one, especially if it doesn't have major stars in it.  perhaps this is merely a case of him paying his dues in a bigger film so he can make better ones in the future with his vision. rating--6 out of 10.  it's not terrible, especially as a character study of pacino's dormer.  it just doesn't leave you with much to think or talk about.",6,0,0,25 May 2002
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," the assassination of my eyelids
","no matter what people write about this movie, it is not bad. but it really can't be considered something of merit either. the performances are so flat and wooden--i realize that some 'critics' would claim them subtle--that none of the characters really shines as someone you want to root for or be too interested in.the good--it's nice looking. the soundtrack fits, too. plus, i liked seeing nick cave late in the movie as a bar singer. plus, the actors look like they could have been from that time period.the bad--it's not malick. i read that the original version was four hours long. oh my goodness!!! this version came in at a sloooooooow two hours forty. not a lot of action and not much reason for us to feel reverence for jesse james. if he's a big deal, make him a big deal.there's a reason movies like this don't do well in theaters. i know that many a good movie is overlooked and misunderstood, but i have no idea what audience would appreciate this. teens? no. women? not many bathing scenes for pitt here. men? not this man.i'm disappointed to see that this director, who has now made two movies that no one has seen, has signed on to do cormac mccarthy's cities of the plain. i wish him, and his audience, better luck.",5,1,4,4 January 2009
28 Days Later...," seemed like 28 decades later
","oh, i was so completely bored beyond repair.  like all danny boyle films, this one has a decent premise, and even starts out okay.  the release of the virus is a statement about human nature, which also turns out to be pretty nasty.  but it's not very nasty.  the infected are no big deal.  they don't really pose much threat if you find a few guns and go out to the country.  i realize city living is pretty fun, and all, but not when infected people want to kill you. and the black tough girl role was done in 'the omega man,' which, for its time, is about 5 times better than this one.  the acting was credible, the look was fine, but the story just didn't interest me.  there were scenes where i was just angry at the characters and their actions.  look, if infected people are about, why oh why oh why do you feel the need to go 'look around.'   dumb, not thought out, relying only on visuals, and boring is no way to go through life, son.  danny boyle has done this in 'the beach,' too.  he started off with a good premise, then it turned into a video game.  in 'trainspotting,' he had all these interesting things happening early in the film--the dirtiest toilet in the world, the guy who spoke like james bond--but then he dropped the ball and didn't keep doing that throughout the film.  never will he get my money again, no matter how good the premise.  maybe he should try commercials or music videos.",3,0,1,26 October 2003
