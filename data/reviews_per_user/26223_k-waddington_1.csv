The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," You will only appreciate this film if you are a fan AND have read the book.
","I wasn't a fan of the first 2 films, as I thought the acting was poor in them, however I also thought the books weren't great. Book 3 and film 3 stepped it up a gear, but book 4 has steadily become one of my favorite books ever. I didn't go to the cinema with high expectations, due to the previous films and expected to be disappointed that a lot of the content of the books might be missed. I was so so so happy after watching this film. The director has stayed true to the book and kept the sweet, beautiful relationship Bella has with Edward, allowing Kristen Stewart to act for once! The soundtrack that accompanies the film is just so beautiful and at times, particularly when walked down the aisle, I felt very emotional! I thought the scenes where they have sex, are tamed down and suitable for the age certificate. My main problem with the Twilight Saga films is that I feel there would be so much more action/passion if the age certificate was higher, however I do see they want to maximize the audience number. I came out of this film desperate to watch it again. Having such a love for the book I felt like it had done it justice and cannot wait to see part 2, where all the 'action' is. People who are slating this film, calling it cheesy, and that nothing much happens....haven't read the book! The 'cheesy' lines are in the book and in the characters like Stephanie Meyer wants, and in all fairness I didn't deem anything to be cheesy!! My bf came out saying 'nothing happened', which it didn't if your wanting action, but if you want to continue on the story of Bella and Edwards love for each other and watch it grow and develop I'm sure you will love this film. Roll on Part 2!!!p.s. stay and watch the scene after the credits...its the volturi :)",10,4,13,25 November 2011
