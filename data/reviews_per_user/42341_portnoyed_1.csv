Kill Bill: Vol. 2," wow uma was great in there
","wow, that was a great movie. really i liked how tarantino used the cheesy camera moves and how he used the characters. while he uses the missing links to the little prologe in the beginning. seriously though, Uma Thurman is sooo sexy. seriously, only in tarantino movies is she great and full of action. i am hoping to see her in other upcomming movies. i would have to say that this movie was well made. as well as kill bill vol.1. the name has a sort of twist to it that has a unique sense of taste. its only so that this has inspired me to write a new certain kind of screenplay that people would enjoy. the screenplay was written well by tarantino. i hope that one day i would be able to meet the cast. though that shall not happen. i shall try my best to get into the movie industry as soon as possible, so i can possibly have Uma and tarantino in my dream movie. its a long shot.",Null,0,1,28 April 2004
