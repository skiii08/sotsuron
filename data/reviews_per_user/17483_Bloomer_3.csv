Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An uneven new start which dwells too much on childish aspects. Good, but only infrequently great - the Force is not completely back yet.
","I'm throwing my opinions into a maelstrom! 962 people have already commented on Phantom Menace on the IMDB, so will anybody even see my review? I guess if you're reading this, the answer is yes :) Like the rest of you, I love to feel a part of Star Wars culture, and grew up with the originals etc etc.. So here are my impressions from a first day screening in Australia.The film started and we had the blast of John William's great theme, and the intro scrolled up the screen, and soon we were on a ship and meeting the 2 Jedi knights. I have to admit I was frightened how I felt immediately at home, back in the Star Wars universe with the exact same atmosphere and aesthetics as all those years ago.Unfortunately the film doesn't maintain this magic evenly, it comes and goes. I'd have to agree with all those who've been disappointed by the kiddy-esque qualities of the film. The great kind of human rapport we used to see between Han, Luke and Leia for instance, is hardly in evidence. I felt shimmers of it between Obi-Won (I loved Ewan MacGregor!) and his master, but this story is about introducing us to Anakin, and in many ways we are in a child's world, so to speak. And yes, the rubbery alien Jar Jar grated on me enormously! He really eats up the screen in an unhelpful and overly 'cute' way that even the Ewoks never did. If I had been Queen Amidala, I would hardly have relied on Jar Jar for anything, let alone arranging a treaty with the other major force on my planet!And yet there's lots to love in this film too. When we do recapture that old atmosphere.. like in the climactic lightsabre battle! The scene where Obi-won is trapped behind the forcefield - well, that's my favourite scene. Very Jedi, very Star Wars, frightening and suspenseful. Accuse me of fidelity studies, but this recaptured some of those great scary traps-and-lightsabre duels at the end of Empire..General reaction to Darth Maul has been 'great! wish there was more of him!' I suppose part of me agrees, yet I think Star Wars has a great tradition of briefly experienced villains who nevertheless exude great threat and mystery by their presence. Boba Fett, for instance. And I think Darth Maul is in that category. He exemplifies the Phantom Menace, stalking the good guys and yet we know nothing about him.What else? Yes, more creatures than ever. Seamless CGI, hectic laser fights on the ground (the 'Saving Private Ryan' part of Star Wars) and in space. Definitely at the expense of story and character, which was Not Good, but impressive and a technological feat nevertheless.Overall - there are some moments of greatness and charm in this film, and it was just exciting to be back in the Star Wars universe for me. But I wasn't there throughout the whole film - the childish aspects, some klunky dialogue and the deficiency of involvement between the characters made a disturbance in my force and would take me away every now and then to a much more mediocre and less interesting universe. Yet, what film could live up to this much hype, and to the hopes in my imagination after all this time?I was excited, but also disappointed. I'm looking forward to having 2 more instalments of Star Wars in the near future though, and hoping they'll be richer than this film was.",9,0,1,4 June 1999
Quantum of Solace," Stop the directors! Stop the editors! I want to get off!
","This is the first time I ever came out of a Bond film at the cinema thinking, 'I enjoyed almost none of that.' And there was no mystery for me as to why I felt this way. I didn't have to weigh up the other pros and cons (it is not an unsophisticated film) or think far or deeply. I couldn't stand Quantum Of Solace because ninety-five percent of its action sequences are appallingly directed and edited. Endless, wobbly extreme closeups are cut together too rapidly into a meaningless dirge which prohibits you from discerning anything about the nature of the scene.How many cars are participating in this car chase? Will I be allowed to glimpse anyone's face in this scene other than Bond's? Will I be allowed to glimpse even Bond's face? Which boat is in front? Where is anything in relation to anything else, ever? And just what was that? That blur in front of me for the past half a second, what the hell was it? The answers to these questions respectively throughout Quantum of Solace are, 'I have no clue, no, no, I don't know, I will never know, I don't know, I still don't know.'I'm tired of reading any defence for the most extreme incarnation of this style of action coverage. It is purposeless obfuscation. It's anti-exciting, annoying and just plain rubbish. Bond films in particular are known for their history of spectacular action and stunts, and if you briefly consider any eighties Bond film, you'll recall that somewhere in it was a long, held shot of something amazing. People fighting on the back of an airborne plane, racing cars through Paris or pursuing each other down a mountain on skis. Compared to any one of those scenes, everything in Quantum is a disgrace, incapable of engendering marvel or wonder.Perhaps I should try to be less catastrophic about the direction of cinema in general and just apportion blame directly to the guy from the Bourne films whose second unit did this to Quantum, and to Marc Forster, who directed the film, and either sanctioned or did not repel the Bourne-on-steroids content. Call me Mister Insane, but I demand the context, information and sense of place delivered by even the occasional wide shot. To see how Bond kung-fu'd an elevator full of guys would be cool, right? The event happens in this film, but what you actually see is a camera jerking crazily over ten inch wide patches of dark clothing, to the accompaniment of cabbages being walloped on the soundtrack. Imagine if Bruce Lee tried to get away with this crap. And this wasn't a well considered case of indicating what had just happened by offering the impression of it rather than the depiction of it, it was simply a continuation of the house style.Quantum Of Solace takes anti-illuminating film-making to new, stupid lows!",3,292,404,17 November 2008
Clash of the Titans," Pretty joyless...
","This remake of the starry-eyed 1981 Greek mythological fantasy adventure has a grungy, ugly look and a completely joyless opening quarter of an hour. Sam Worthington's blokey performance as Perseus turns out to be roughly interchangeable with the performances he gave in both Avatar and the last Terminator film, though Clash has next to no character development on the cards for Sam or any of its other actors. What little humour there is comes in the form of cynical one-liners from one of Perseus's bearded mates. The film is mostly a series of grunty fight scenes involving sandaled humans versus giant CGI monsters â€“ giant scorpions, giant medusa, giant kraken, etc.One of the heroes of the original Clash was a cute clockwork golden owl named Bubo. When trailers for the new Clash were screening, my friend and I joked about whether Bubo would make the remake. I said, 'there's no way they're going to have a cute robot owl. This film looks way too grungy and they're playing heavy metal music on the trailer.'To all our surprises, Bubo did appear, albeit for ten seconds. Just before Perseus sets out on his adventure, he is digging around in a supply chest when he pulls out... Bubo, looking and sounding exactly like the little blighter did in 1981. This caused me to cry aloud: 'Oh my God!'Perseus considers the owl briefly and says something like, 'What the hell is this?' His bearded one-linery friend responds with, 'Don't worry about it, just leave it here.' Then they shove the owl back in the box and go adventuring. In retrospect this was the wittiest moment in the whole film, even if it only made sense to people who knew the original. If you had been wondering if the owl would reappear, this scene both satisfied your desire to see the owl again and then reassured you that, 'Okay, that's the owl issue dealt with, so no, the owl won't be in the film in general, and now you can stop worrying about it.'The basic strike against the new film, which amounts to 1000 strikes, is that not a single aspect of it is developed in any satisfying way. Dialogue is absolute nuts and bolts stuff to propel the simple plot. The people in the film aren't moved when their pals are killed, so you aren't either. There's a cast of gods in Olympus, but 80% of them stand in the background saying nothing, etc. etc.The new Princess Andromeda is dull as dishwater in a cut down role (but I was kind of in love with Judi Bowker of the original film, so I am biased). The principal female role now belongs to lovely Gemma Arterton as Io, the ageless half human, uh, toga'd spirit type woman.(?) If I thought anyone would ever say anything remotely poetic in this film, I'd have put money on her character saying it. But nobody does and she didn't.The old Clash of the Titans was extraordinary with romance, G rated magic and beautiful scenery, no matter how naff some of it was. The new one is ugly and weak, brisk and dumb. I think it's safe to say that no kid who is seven years old now will be looking back on this film with any fondness in thirty years' time.",4,2,6,1 April 2010
