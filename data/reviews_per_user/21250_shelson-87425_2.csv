Hereditary," One hell of a rollercoaster ride
","It is rare to see a film that presents such a brilliant combination of both gripping drama and chilling horror throughout. Alongside several other brilliant showcases of acting, Toni Collette gives an almost flawless performance and fulfils her role to her absolute best. The film's frequent bumps and turns are already disturbing enough without the terrifying injections of supernatural elements, making for a tense and gripping film throughout. Whilst Hereditary's conclusion is initially confusing and a lot to take in, a quick Google search puts the pieces together and makes one even more appreciative of Aster's carefully constructed plot. A must-see for anyone who is brave enough!",9,2,5,2 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," More admirable than satisfying, but nonetheless a thoroughly entertaining piece from Tarantino
","The film, like its title, is a long one. Unfortunately, the 2hr 40min runtime unveils its perks only after reaching a turning point, in which a traditional Tarantino plot begins to emerge from the movie's pre-eminent focus on aesthetics and period detail. This is not to say, however, that this focus was ultimately a poor decision. In fact, it succeeds very strongly in creating a sense of nostalgia for those who lived throughout the 60s, or a sense of longing for those who did not. I personally felt as if this damaged the film's character development to an extent - time and place seemed to override its human counterparts. Rick's character was never one that I had a great deal of care for, but he did help in solidifying the plot's orientation around a mid-tier actor who is struggling to sustain the peak of his career. Leo DiCaprio's plays this role with confidence and flair. However, I think it is Rick's stunt double, Cliff Booth, who steals the show. Booth generates consistent interest with his silent charisma and we often find amusement in his nonchalant approach to pretty much anyone or anything. This is thanks to a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate, on the other hand, is granted an ungenerous amount of screen-time and dialogue. Whilst Robbie injects the role with plenty of vivaciousness, her character feels somewhat irrelevant, especially to those who are not equipped with context. This brings me to the second half of the film. Once the titular characters are finally connected to the Manson cult, the plot quickly develops traction and we begin to fear for the worst. Tarantino, however, gives his audiences a completely subversive climax that is not only wildly entertaining but also quite clever in its conformity with the 'happy ending' trope of Hollywood films. It fulfils the film's purpose as providing a celebratory lens into what Tarantino and many others consider to be the Golden Age of the American film industry and the American lifestlye itself. After watching this movie, I felt slightly underwhelmed due to its uncertain character development but became more satisfied after recognising the unique and very personal directorial vision with which Tarantino was equipped. What I can say with certainty is that anyone will enjoy this film for its aesthetics and entertainment value. 7/10",7,0,2,22 May 2020
