Black Panther," Review
","Overall I found this movie very entertaining it is packed with action and some moments of comedy and suspense. The way the director creates each individual character is very unique they each character has special characteristics that is unique to them. Also the way he introduces new characters throughout the movie , in example when he first introduced Killmunger he was seemed to be the general villainous role but as the character develops we see the way that he came to be and the cause of his anger",8,2,5,23 October 2018
