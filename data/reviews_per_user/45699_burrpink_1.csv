Captain Phillips," Tom Hanks at his Best!
","Mr. Hanks again proves that he is 'the Best' by taking us to the edge. He has always been my favorite, but this is yet another example of 'Awesome' that all other craftsmen strive for. Great story, great acting, feel the tension, see the action! You are there on the edge of your seat! Rich Phillips is as calm and collected as is possible in this situation, and Tom Hanks has us believing that we are there. Both amateur and professional actors come together to tell this amazing story. Apollo 13, Castaway, Philadelphia, Walt Disney, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Charlie Wilson. ....... Who knew that our favorite Bosom Buddy would put together such a amazing collection of work! Keep it up Tom, love you.",10,0,1,3 November 2013
