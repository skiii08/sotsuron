Marie Antoinette," Truly Awful
","This movie was truly the most awful movie I ever saw. When I first the trailer I thought this would be a great biography on the life of Marie Antoinette, I was terribly wrong. Watching this was like watching a documentary on Paris Hilton. It shows no important events in Marie Antoinette's life, not even the affire of the necklace, all it shows is a spoiled brat wasting her life in a palace. The music is also quiet out of place, for instead of the usual period piece music it uses rock. . . yes rock.So if you value your time (and money), DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES watch this movie.",1,8,13,7 November 2006
