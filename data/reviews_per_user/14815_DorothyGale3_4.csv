Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch
","Director Zack Snyder created a world where young girls can dive into an alternate reality and have the power to kick some serious ass. When Baby Doll, Emily Browning, is put into an insane asylum by her abusive, controlling step father that is ordering her to get a lobotomy, she uses her mind to escape from this tragic world and creates a reality where she visualizes a plan that will help her and her friends escape. Unfortunately, she only has a few short days and escaping is quite impossible especially when Blue Jones, Oscar Isaac, is not just keeping the girls inside a mental hospital, it's also a disgusting brothel. Can Baby Doll and friends escape or will she be a victim of a lobotomy living in a brothel/mental institute where disgusting men control young innocent girls? I saw this movie the day it came out, and I've tried to write this review a number of times but just couldn't muster up the words to describe it. The story line was intriguing, but brutal. The film starts out with an intense scene of Baby Doll accidentally killing her sister right after they watch their mother die. Her scary abusive stepfather forces her to this mental hospital which is also a brothel. Watching young innocent girls be controlled by filthy older men is hard to watch. But, Snyder made it interesting by having these core 5 girls be fearless, uncontrollable, strong and relentless. Baby Doll, portrayed by Emily Browning is seen fighting enormous creatures with swords and tumbling through the snow as if she has been trained all her life. Sweet Pea, portrayed by Abbie Cornish, is only in the institution because her sister Rocket, played by Jena Malone, ran away from home and was captured here; Sweet Pea followed her and has to care for her. Blondie, Vanessa Hudgens and Amber, Jamie Chung will do anything to escape this horrible brothel prison. All five girls are fighting in the alternate reality with guns and their strength. I love how it's these beautiful young girls with their hair and makeup completely done and they all are kicking butt! The shots in this film are beautiful. I love Snyder's style. He tells even the ugliest stories, beautifully. He has his slow motion action shots and the gritty colors that convey the entire tone for the film.I enjoyed this film up until the ending. I guess because I didn't completely understand it. I think Snyder complicated the ending to make it more unique but it hurt the film and the ratings. I highly recommend seeing this film to anyone who enjoys Zack Snyder's directing style and young girls that can fight like characters in a video game, otherwise wait for the DVD.",Null,3,4,12 April 2011

","If you have not seen this film, you are missing out! James Cameron's newest film 'Avatar', is a must see. This sci-fi fantasy is absolutely amazing. Avatar takes place in the future with high tech technology and machinery where scientists can create human-like 'avatars' that look exactly like, Na'vis, the native aliens that live on the moon Pandora. Sam Worthington, who plays Jake Sully, the handicapped marine who has to accomplish a mission when Dr. Grace Augustine (played by Sigourney Weaver) asks him to help study and learn about the Na'vis and their land. Things get interesting when Jake transforms into his avatar and meets Neytiri, portrayed by Zoë Saldena. Neytiri is this beautiful native from Pandora that's passionate about her family and her home land. She is in my opinion, the strongest and most fascinating character in the film. Neytiri and Jake become fast friends when Neytiri's parents have her teach Jake to become a true Na'vi. Neytiri spends her time with Jake teaching him the Na'vi language, 'making the bond' with a banshee, a huge beautiful birdlike creature that Na'vis can ride on, and how to hunt different creatures throughout the land. When Jake is not being his avatar he is dealing with orders from Colonel Miles Quaritch, played by Stephen Lang, and Parker Selfridge, played by the funny Giovanni Ribisi. Col. Quaritch and Parker want to tear down a huge area in the Navi land on Pandora for rocks that are worth millions. Jake has to deal with a very difficult decision and could cost him his trust with the Na'vi natives.Overall, I think this film is brilliant. There is not a single complaint that I have for this movie. It's beautiful to watch, James Cameron's imagination on screen is absolutely mind blowing. His idea of Pandora and the exquisite Na'vis that are ten feet tall, blue with long dreads and a single braid down their back used for making bonds, and strikingly huge yellow eyes that make every scene feel so real that they almost seem like humans, are stunning. Cameron's shots of Jake and his banshee experiencing their first flight together and the breathtakingly beautiful levitating Hallelujah Mountains are unbelievable.The acting is also great. Sam Worthington and Zoë Saldena do a remarkable job together throughout the film and Stephen Lang is impressive and intimidating which works perfectly for his character. Giovanni Ribisi also brings a lot to the table along with veteran sci-fi actress Sigourney Weaver who portrays her character Grace as a lovable hard-ass. Even the supporting cast, such as Joel Moore who plays Norm Spellman, another scientist who works with the avatars and Michelle Rodriquez who plays Trudy who flies the helicopters throughout Pandora was superior as well. The dialogue was fun and understandable. There was a perfect amount of action and the acting was outstanding. This movie should only be witnessed in the IMAX 3D theater. This is a groundbreaking epic film that could have the power to change the way we view movies from here on out. To me, Avatar wasn't a movie. It was an experience.",Null,1,4,20 March 2011
Limitless," Limitless
","Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro, and Abbie Cornish star in a fast-paced, unpredictable film, 'Limitless.' The film focuses on an unmotivated writer, Eddie Morra, who lives in a dirty disastrous apartment and appears as though he hasn't showered or combed his hair in forever. His girlfriend, Lindy (Cornish) can't handle her loser/broke boyfriend and breaks up with him. After stumbling through the streets he bumps into his ex-wife's brother, Vernon, Johnny Whitworth, and decides to have a drink with him and catch up. After their drink, Vernon presents Eddie with NZT, a tiny clear pill that causes humans to access 100% of their brain after 30 seconds of swallowing it. Eddie decides to take one pill and suddenly his life takes a drastic turn. People on NZT are dying from taking too much or stopping it all together, time and pills are running out, can Eddie survive or is it too late??'Limitless' was a film that literally had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Cooper was magnificent in the ever evolving character of Eddie. He carried the entire film, effortlessly. I enjoyed the film, but for some reason I feel as though something was missing. It didn't exactly leave me wanting more but it made me feel as though it lacked heart. I didn't care that much for Eddie. I rooted for his character at times, but part of me didn't really care in the end. The acting was great, two time Academy Award winner Robert DeNiro had a small yet powerful role as Carl Van Loom, head of a major company that wants Eddie to work for him. Abbie Cornish delivered a fine performance as well as Eddie's on-again off-again girlfriend. The story line was awesome, it was unique and original and I enjoyed the thought that a teeny tiny pill can alter so much. Watching Eddie ride on this ZNT roller-coaster was fascinating and thrilling. But it could only go so far. I wanted to feel more about the character and craved to care about what would happen to him, but I didn't. This left me feeling very unsure about this film. I enjoyed everything except that aspect. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Bradley Cooper, and a fun exhilarating film that makes you think the unthinkable.",Null,0,1,12 April 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Transformers: Dark of the Moon
","Director Michael Bay needs to stop filming sequels to the blockbuster mega hit 'Transformers.' The latest film, to complete the trilogy, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' was a major disappointment. The film begins with a tale about how the U.S. government lied to the American people about why they needed to land on the moon. Supposedly, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were on a mission to the moon to find out what was up there before the Russians could. Only 35 people knew about this mission that changes history and now in the year 2011, the only reason why America has not been back to the moon since 1972 is because of the alien robots that Aldrin and Armstrong discovered on their epic space mission. So, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is back with a new model girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), the Autobots, and his military buddies, Lennox (josh Duhamel) and Epps (Tyrese Gibson). The Autobots and Sam have to discover all the top secret information on the dark side of the moon before the Decepticons take over, destroy all of Earth and turn the humans into slaves. Can Sam and the Autobots save the day for the 3rd time, or will the Decepticons finally win this treacherous battle? 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' was awful. It was way too much information, too much action; too much confusion as to what exactly was going on and who was who. The story line was too complex for an action film. It seemed as though the beginning was a completely different film then the ending. There was so much going on in the film, that it will not hold the viewer's attention long enough, especially since the film is almost three hours long. Michael Bay took this film a little too far. He installed too many ideas and stories and subplots that aren't even that interesting or intriguing to make any moviegoer want to sit and watch for three hours. The stories were too confusing that the average moviegoer will eventually get bored and walk out. It starts out with some American history about our space mission to the moon and how surprise, surprise the government keeping secrets from the American people. Then it's present day and Sam is living with his hardworking, rich girlfriend who is of course a supermodel. How does Sam keep getting these runway models for girlfriends? Anyway, all of a sudden the audience learn that the Decepticons are planning to take over the Earth and destroy the Autobots and Sam is the only one who can save the day. It seems that simple, but that's really all that is understood. There are a lot of deceptions and twists that create confusion which then turns this film into a massive headache.The acting was good. Shia LaBeouf was great as usual, but unfortunately this film he wasn't as funny as he was in the other films. He usually has his great, clever one-liners that add comic relief to the film, the reason why most people enjoy the film other than the non-stop action. But, this film he didn't have much to work with. His new girlfriend Carly, (Huntington-Whiteley) is of course just prancing around in her underwear or little dresses and adds absolutely nothing to the film. She is boring and not a good actress. Josh Duhamel is back and great as well, but he doesn't have much screen time at all. Sam's parents Ron and Judy (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) make a small appearance, which was funny but again their roles were small. The robots hog up the entire screen and not in a good way. Half of the film is just them fighting the Decepticons and majority of the dialogue is Optimus Prime making up these random 'heartfelt' speeches and Carly screaming. The film feels like it will end about 16 times, then the realization occurs that there is another entire hour left.The action was awesome, but again way too much. There is no happy medium whatsoever, there's too much robots and action and not enough humans and dialogue. Hopefully, this will be the last film for Michael Bay and crew.This film is not recommended, please don't waste time or money; wait for the DVD if it's that essential in life to see.",Null,1,4,30 June 2011
