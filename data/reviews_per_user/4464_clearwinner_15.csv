Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A sequel more powerful than its predecessor
","I loved the second part of the seres more than the first part as it gives the how the murder which led to all the events in the future happened. The characters are thickened and given a more meaning than the previous part. Ah! the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. I mean The action movies are about the soundtrack but in this soundtrack captures the moment and emotions perfectly. The lead character's past is shown in this part and thus it appeals more and clearly shows how she evolved in the process. Even her relationships are shown, the face off between the assassins and the lead character are just awesome and the final end scene and the end are marvelous. The end conversation between Bill and Black Mamba answers all your doubts and closes all the loose ends.",8,1,4,18 September 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Pointless Movie, Excellent humor, Superb Thrill
","You see even I hated Quentin Tarantino for the lack of plot. But he does not make serious, thoughtful or intellectual movies but humorous movies (if you get those) in an excellent manner. He knows how to tell a story so that a person who watches it must enjoy himself. The opening scene is such a tense one that you would get what to expect later and even very tense situations come later but he fuses them with humor so subtly that you get a real kick at that time. He is the best story teller in Hollywood. No one makes a screenplay like him where nobody watching the movie is disappointed. I have seen all his movies none of them bored me. Yes they maybe similar but they are unique in terms of their content and all his dialogs are iconic. Lastly if you do not like Tarantino then you would never like him unless you change your perception regarding him.",9,0,1,1 October 2014
Oldboy," If you want give a shock to yourself this is highly recommended
","There is no better word other than disturbing which can summarize this movie. The movie is not a masterpiece, it may be because I watched the subbed version of the Korean movie but really the film seems to be unintentionally disturbing at times. The climax takes the cherry. The screenplay makes the movie what it is but I found a lot of glitches in the movie.. The movie is surely not well directed because it feels absurd when the person is searching for the truth and I am unable to decipher what is happening. New characters are introduced without giving clear introduction to them. There is a fight sequence where the lead actor has a fight with some 10-12 odd guys.. That is the worst scene, I mean it was so out of the movie, it felt like he wanted to show us a fight and just dragged that part. Music is not up to the mark, and in the music which is played when the movie opens is pathetic, it does not even go with what is happening. The person(Oh-Dae-Su) is tortured to ultimate level which is the best thing in the movie and is very disturbing but the story telling was good but it missed severely in direction department. Many scenes were over directed.So there it is as a whole you would find the movie very disturbing but worth the movie for a one time view.",7,0,4,11 October 2014
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A wonderful movie
",Mixing war and comedy is very great thing in itself. I came to know the depth of the movie later after watching it that it was just a mockery of the whole war and its personnel's. From the beginning of the movie the tone is set for a comical ride.It delivers that. I mean the movie is simply wonderful because it shows the futility of the war and the insane people responsible for it. It is simply hilarious with the funny names of the character and even they seem like clowns.Dr. Strangelove appears in only the last The war details are presented in a proper minutes and gives the movie a perfect finish. manner not in any random manner/Really it is a masterpiece in itself.,10,1,3,1 October 2014
Barry Lyndon," A very Scenic movie
","If you love the olden cinematography then give this movie a watch. Seriously the movie is worthy of Oscar for its backgrounds, costumes and art. These must be your priority while watching this movie. There is an amazing background music, which will never let you off. Apart from this there is nothing much to the movie, it has a simple script where initially I felt like Forrest Gump but soon after wards it became pretty much clichéd, so I was not interested in watching the second half as you could predict what would happen. But the forest part till the intermission id quite entertaining with all the lovely sceneries and women, costumes and what not. From an art point of view this movie would feel like a beautiful painting but do not expect more from the movie, there are many scenes which seem to be not useful to the script or bearing no importance at all, but still the compensates all these errors with an amazing background score. I decided the movie for a 7 but the music and costumes forced me to give an 8. As a whole give a watch to this movie.",8,3,6,20 September 2014
Interstellar," Do not read the review just go and enjoy this MASTERPIECE
","Well we all know about Christopher Nolan so it would be just a waste of your time telling how wonderful the movie was.a)Great Story b)Great Narratioin or the turn up of events c)Simple to follow d)Breathtaking Visuals e)Mesmerising Music f)Great Actors.. I can go on and on....This movie is for audience. YOu have a little family drama, a suspense, trill, humor, SCI-FI, action, adventure.... I mean it is a whole package. I loved the scene where they land on the water planet and the waves come... Seriously what a shot that was. Just I did not like the end, I was expecting a more complicated sort of end like the inception, and that would have seriously added a magic touch to the film. It should not have been a happy ending as it happens.Anyways just go and watch the movie, even if you do not understand anything the visuals are worth the money. It's a pity that where I watched the movie the room had just 15 members out of the 200 strength there, well they are just happy watching Indian flicks.",9,2,9,7 November 2014
Rush," Action Packed
","This movie is a nice watch, I would say a well directed movie showing the rivalry between two formula one champions. I did not know anything about the two prior to this movie but the movie gave me good insight. I enjoyed this movie but I felt the story was too simple as if evident what was going to happen. It felt like a commercial film. The conversations between the two should have been more insightful. The action scenes were really good. I did not get bored that is the best thing in this movie but definitely not a great movie. The movie could be said a bit clichéd. The music was not that good. Some of the scenes were not at all required. The most depressing thing for me was Natallie Dormer just appears for 5 minutes. But Nevertheless if you love action then this film ranks very high among the action flicks due to sheer direction because it is very difficult to make a movie on car racing that too for the period of 1970-76. So go for it if you love action",8,1,2,28 September 2014
The Pianist," Unable to portray the point of the movie
","The movie opens up with the German attack, then there is some kind of love or whatever scene between the lead and some random girl (who appears next towards the end). Then it shows some family drama. Again here there is no much insight given to the lead so it becomes to rack what is being shown and why it is being shown. I was lost for most of the time during the first half. The events occur very quickly and the tension is slack. You would not fell any kind of tension during the first half because it just shows some random events occurring to their family members and some children. It seems more like a cliché. Well apart from this, the most irritating thing for me was the relation of the lead and his brother. The brother was not happy with the pianist , OK I accepted that fact but how did this contribute to the story. I felt these all scenes were just added for the sake of inclusion of drama in the movie. But it did not go well with the plot. The second half shows the struggle of the pianist which was again badly written. The screenplay was too slack. There were numerous scenes of fading to black and they were noticeable because it was just a 30 seconds scene and then it fades to black. That thing gave me a very disgust feeling. But the film redeems itself in the last few minutes but still all those things were expected. Overall the events does not fuse itself well in the movie. It is based on a true event, I accept but surely does not deserve a place in the top 250.",7,0,1,25 October 2014
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," I saw it coming
","This movie has a very nice,subtle plot. This kind of movies where a child is the lead actor is very tricky to do and I felt the director succeeded to pull this movie off but not up to its full potential. The innocent simplistic mind of a child was not given much importance. The movie could have been one notch higher if we had been put in the mind of the child, because it took me some time to get how would a child think under these conditions. I felt there were many loopholes in the plot. but anyway we are not supposed to look over these because the main thing in the movie is the innocence of a child and how the realization of the loss of child for a German soldier and devastating experience that the jews felt in those camps. The screenplay was very good in some parts and mediocre in the rest. It felt a little odd that the child does not ask his mother all this questions, I felt the tutor part a tad bit of a drag, I understood this was a crucial point of the film but was it that powerful so as to change the behavior of her sister ? The movie did not felt smooth if I had to clear. Well except all this facts the conversation between the two boys is really nice. This was the best part of the movie especially the Jew boy did an awesome job. That could emote his tension in the camp with the innocence of a child. Even his expressions were so subtle. This Jew boy was damn perfect throughout the movie. Well i may have rated it somewhat low, but believe me go watch this movie to experience the Nazi camps and its effect in poor souls.",7,0,1,18 October 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Entertainer
","A nice adaptation by one of the finest directors. What you will find in this movie is an amazing screenplay that I feel is the USP of the movie. If told in a linear way it would not have created the same impact. A bride who goes for revenge from her assassins, and what a revenge she takes. You may find certain flaws here and there but this is not about finding mistakes it is just about enjoying the cinema and the sharing the same pulse as the protagonist.I loved the anime part.It was the best part of the movie for me. I really liked the way the anime was used. It's like using the technology in the best possible manner. The action sequences are nicely directed and the lead actor Uma Thurman does wonderful piece as if it was meant for her. In the first chapter you will experience what amount if violence is coming up seeing the fight there. The characters background is not thickened in this part but nevertheless fights are awesome",8,2,6,18 September 2014
From Dusk Till Dawn," It's Entertaining
","The movie opens up very nicely, which sets the the right tone for the movie. This is the typical Tarantino part,and man I really loved the opening act. But as time passes the story becomes wayward, it's like the humor didn't fuse well with the script. The twist doesn't come out properly. I would say the director was at fault here. The Final act was good, but the script was dilated by the direction and ends with God knows what kind of ending.Overall I would say the screenplay was really nice, the story was good enough but it is mainly the direction which did not make the film what it could have been. The music as always was good especially the song where Salma Hayek appears. Watch it for Tarantino.",6,0,0,23 August 2014
A Clockwork Orange," Weak Story cannot expect more
","The movie has a very ordinary story.. at the end of the movie you may have liked the direction acting DOP and all but the story is clichéd. Some of the scenes are too dragged. The parents refuse to accept their son .. I felt this movie can only be enjoyed from a direction point of view. I don't understand why the breasts of the woman were shown in the last part. This movie was rated X but believe me, there is not much of such content. May be it has become a common thing nowadays so I am not feeling for the time it was made. But I would give maximum credits to direction, the scenes were so well directed so you can call it more of a film noir. It is not the typical drama it is presented in a very picturesque manner. Stanley Kubrick with all his Trade mark shots makes you realize he was one of the finest directors. I forgot the music is really used beautifully and gives an edge to the film. I was bored in many parts of the movie but considering the time it was made it is really very commendable.",7,1,2,15 September 2014
Reservoir Dogs," Unique
","The movie as a whole was very good. But I did not quite love the screenplay, they were satirical correct but in some parts the story was dull. I felt in that way may be it was not the kind I like, but the film quickly makes up for it with the suspense being revealed just after the mid time and the aftermath. The end was quite fantastic but I would have loved if Freddy was not caught. But still the movie is directed in a unique manner and really it needs gut to make movie about heist without showing the heist. The acting I would say was top-class, all the characters were in their character till the last. It felt perfect for the movie, even the dialogues as expected were top notch. As a Whole I just did not like the movie in parts but as a whole it was fantastic but not the kind I would say greatest.",8,0,0,13 September 2014
Eyes Wide Shut," King of Drags
","I never torture myself to this extent, I felt bad after 1 hr into the movie but kept pushing myself to see something happens, but Voila nothing happened. As if everything was a joke let's forget it. The movie was so much dragged that i took three and a half hours to see. I slept for about 15 minutes in between. Theere is nothing great about this movie, may be just showing the insecurities about the people, but could n't it be shown in an interesting manner. There is no humour even in the movie. What a bore. The only thing I liked about the movie was the piano background theme. One thing which I have noticed after watching several Kubrick films (due to compulsion) is that he just takes you to a position where you will expect something is about to come but then leaving you at that point without any further revelation. If you call this artsy then you watch this movie otherwise it is a bore.",3,1,4,17 September 2014
The Godfather," Do not keep high expectations from this one
","The only good thing about the movie was its style. It is unique. The second thing was Al Pacino, I mean he just holds everything still while he speaks. REally commendable performance. The opening scene was fantastic'I believe in America' perfectly lit shot. After that everything is a drag. I get bored by the end of the movie. It has elongated scenes , I mean these so elongated that you can take a nap without missing anything. It was more like a opera kind of movie. So the opera lovers may like this movie but for me it was boring. Go watch it if you kind of love family drama said in a kind of some song and well love to nourish the scenes",4,6,15,5 October 2014
