First Man," Watching paint dry minus the fumes
","This has a 7.5 rating?! WTF?
This was dark, gloomy, sad, and BORING!Just plain terrible.",4,1,3,21 July 2019
The Irishman," Flat, dull, over acted
",Just plain bad. It is painfully slow. The characters are so under developed that you don't care what happens to them. It's just awful.,4,2,6,9 December 2019
BlacKkKlansman," 5 stars for the humor none for the directing
","There were some hilarious moments, however overall it was a snooze-fest and another of Spike's soap box, hateful, propaganda political tirades.
The story could have been a good one.You know who can break down racial divides, Chris Rock, or Eddie Murphy. Those guys can have EVERY person in the room on the same page. You don't have to bring up racism with hatefulness. It pushes people back. The opposite of what the world needs right now.",5,3,10,21 April 2019
A Quiet Place," So quiet you could sleep through it
","What a snoozer. This film had two speeds; slow and much slower.
Having trouble sleeping? No worries, wind this pile of crap up and you'll be down in no time...or sure as hell wish you were.",3,1,5,20 August 2019
