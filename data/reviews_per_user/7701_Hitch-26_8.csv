Vertigo," Unbelievable
","Hitchcock's Vertigo(1958) is generally regarded as one of Hitch's greatest movies ever and for good reason.  This movie has it all--great costumes and hairstyles by Edith Head, outstanding musical score by the incomparable Bernard Herrmann, incredible acting performances by James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes, and of course flawless directing by Hitchcock.  I really don't want to talk about the plot of the movie, but I will say it is a very complex but interesting one.  I read somewhere that Hitch wasn't really satisfied with Kim Novak's performance, but I can't see why.  Maybe it was the perception of her back then as a sex symbol ala Marilyn Monroe.  Her dual character role is one of the toughest to perform in all of the Hitch's movies.  The only one that can compare is the role of Marnie.  She is fantastic.  I love watching this movie more and more and I can't get enough of the music.  Do yourself a favor--if you have never seen this movie, go rent it now.  You will not be disappointed.",10,4,4,2 September 2000
Lifeboat," Outstanding Cast
","Lifeboat is a gem of a movie.  The cast is outstanding especially Talluah Bankhead.  William Bendix, Walter Slezak, John Hodiak, and Hume Cronyn are also great.  Having the setting of the movie on the lifeboat for the entire time is another example of Hitchcock brilliance.  The man doesn't make bad movies(although some are mediocre--see The Paradine Case), and this is a classic example of a diamond in the rough.  A must-see movie.",Null,3,4,30 September 2000
Meet the Parents," Great Comedy
","It had been a long time since I have seen a comedy; however, Meet the Parents was well-worth the wait.  Robert DeNiro, who is one of my all-time favorite actors, is brilliant as Jack Byrnes.  I felt that his performance for a comedy was even better than his role in Midnight Run.  Ben Stiller was also excellent as the guy who has everything possibly bad happen to him. Terri Polo, Blythe Danner, and James Rebhorn are solid in supporting roles, but it is Owen Wilson that really shines.  Keep an eye on him--because he will be a star.  A lot of people have been badmouthing this movie, but I feel that it was a really well-written and acted movie.  I think some people were expecting too much or are hard to please.  If you are a big fan of Stiller and/or DeNiro you must see this movie.  I feel that this movie is a must-see anyway.  10 out of 10.",10,0,0,15 October 2000
North by Northwest," Greatest Hitchcock Movie EVER!!
","I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie.  This movie has everything.  It has action, drama, comedy, lively music(thank you Bernard Herrmann), great costumes(thank you Edith Head), and of course outstanding performances not only by Hitch in directing, but in acting with Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Jessie Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll(He was in every Hitch movie it seemed), and Martin Landau(in his first film role--he was brilliant as Leonard).  I love the way Cary Grant says things in such a deadpan way like when he says early in the movie, 'Don't tell me where we going, surprise me!'  Although long, you will not be bored for a single second.  It is really hard for me to believe that Ben-Hur was that great. This movie should have won several oscars.  The end is very memorable as well although I won't give it away.  This movie had several memorable scenes although without question Cary Grant running from the plane is probably the most famous and one of the most famous in all of movies.  One curious note is that Jessie Royce Landis, who also appeared with Grant in To Catch a Thief, plays Grant's mother although Grant is 10 months older than her! Also, make sure you pay attention to the kid in the cafeteria who sticks his fingers in his ears a tad too early!  It is a shame that when people mention Hitchcock's name, they think of the horror stuff like Psycho or The Birds or they think of the taut thrillers like Vertigo or Rear Window.  Not that there is anything wrong with these movies, it is just that nobody thinks he can direct such a non-stop action picture like this.  It may have been the most atypical Hitch movie ever in terms of style, but I feel it is his greatest ever.  If you have never seen this movie, you got to go see it now--you'll be glad that you did.  I'll leave with another one of my favorite lines in the movie that Cary Grant says to Eva Marie Saint, 'How does a girl like you become a girl like you?'  WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!",10,1,1,2 September 2000
Psycho," The First Modern Horror Classic
","Revolutionary in its time, Hitchcock's Psycho still shocks today when viewed.  It is the standard that every horror movie is judged by.  Filmed in black and white, everything in this movie--the music, the dialogue, the scenery, etc. is perfectly in sync and is a big reason this movie is a classic.  One bad thing is that I read somewhere that one of the goofs in the movie is when Janet Leigh is killed in the bathroom and staring at the camera, you can see her adam's apple moving.  I had never noticed that, but after reading that I noticed it the next time I watched it and it sort of ruined the illusion for me.  Oh well, that was about the only thing wrong with this movie.  Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam are all outstanding.  Herrmann's score is one of his best, and there are so many memorable scenes that you just need to go watch it right now. One of Hitch's 5 best.",10,5,9,9 September 2000
Rear Window," Maybe Hitchcock's Greatest Movie
","This movie along with Vertigo, Psycho, and North by Northwest is a timeless classic that is one of Hitch's 5 best.  The only question is, is it his best movie?  You can make a strong case.  This movie has everything--great cast which included Jimmy Stewart(in probably his best role), Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, and Raymond Burr.  It had great costumes--I didn't think it was possible to make the gorgeous Kelly look even better but somehow Edith Head did.  It had a great plot that kept you in suspense the entire movie.  It also had one of the best Hitch villains ever in Lars Thorwald, excellently played by Burr.  However, without question, Stewart's performance is tremendous.  Just to watch him act with his face and body language is incredible.  An interesting note is that the songwriter was the creator of Alvin and the Chipmunks aka David Seville (real name Ross Bagsdarian).  I could go on and on about this movie, but you, the viewer, need to watch it, especially if you have never seen it before.  A movie that will stand the test of time.",10,0,2,9 September 2000
Saboteur," Solid Movie
","Saboteur was one of Hitchcock's most underrated films.  The film reminds me a lot of The 39 Steps with some of the plot devices.  Robert Cummings(who would later be in Dial M for Murder), Priscilla Lane, Otto Kruger, and Norman Lloyd all give fine performances.  The final scene atop the Statue of Liberty is one of Hitch's best.  A movie that definitely is worth watching.",Null,1,3,30 September 2000
The Birds," Memorable Hitchcock Classic
","Although it was 3 years after Psycho, The Birds was well worth the wait. Although the acting wasn't great--Tippi Hedren was much better in Marnie, the special effects in this movie was absolutely awesome.  You have to remember that this was 1963 and that there were no computer graphics/animation to pull off the illusion needed to make this movie successful.  I felt that not having any music for this movie was an effective move by Hitch that added to the eerieness of the picture.  Just thinking about the chance of every bird in the world to gang up on the human race sends chills down my spine.  Hitchcock is able to pull it off.  One of his 10 best.  If you have never seen this movie, you must see it as soon as possible.",10,0,0,9 September 2000
