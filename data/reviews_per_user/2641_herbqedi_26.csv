Moneyball," Exploration of Unconventional and Unpopular Computerization of ML Baseball tale told in an emotionally distant manner
","Bill James is lionized here by main character Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and cohort 'Peter Brand' (Jonah Hill in the film's only engaging performance). However, only 4 main concepts are touch upon: On-Base Percentage, never intentionally walk a batter, avoid bunting, and avoid stealing. I agree with all four principles. Inly the first is dwelt upon at length. Other favorite categories of Bill James are ignored. As is the fact that the team had 3 great starters - Barry Zito, a certain Hall of Famer who won the Cy Young was not even mentioned. That said, as a lifetime baseball fan, I enjoyed the baseball angle of the movie as well as taking on veteran scouts and the establishment as rooted in the dark ages wedded to approaches that just don't work. All of this makes for a terrific sports debate and a very interesting book (Moneyball).As a movie made for entertainment, however, it didn't really deliver more than some ironic humor here and there. Pitt played Bean as aloof and emotionally vapid even while talking passionately about his theories. That was a subtext to the entire movie as we spend a lot of time watching Pitt in his car keeping his family and colleagues at a distance with his Bluetooth. That may be accurate - one of the subtexts seemed to be that while Beane helped bring baseball thinking into a new era while overcoming obstacles, his own life remained rather inconsequential. His history-achieving 20th straight win which consumes about 5 minutes of film is immediately written off by Bean himself in 20 seconds. Again, probably an interesting observation and quite possibly true, but not very entertaining or rewarding.The scenes between him and his guitar-playing daughter (or mostly her voice) are monotonic and just seem to be their to contribute to the subtext of his personal loneliness. Yawn! The scene where he discusses the daughter with his ex-wife (Robin Wright in a static performance that is little more than a cameo) and her new husband is even more clichéd and vapid. Phillip Seymour Hoffman who can be remarkably good in some roles (Capote, Charlie Wilson's War, Almost Famous) and remarkably bad in others (Punch-Drunk Love, State & Main) is neither here. He portrays Art Howe through Beane's eyes as a traditional chew-spitting, hard-headed, fundamentals-preaching manager. Hoffman's portrayal is more than adequate for a clichéd character that contributes nothing of substance to the movie. Thank goodness for Joanh Hill (who I frankly haven't liked in the other two kid-oriented movies I saw him in). Although the name of his character has been changed from real life, he lets us into his thoughts, feelings, and cares about his relationships. In this movie, that was a much-needed breath of fresh air.If you are interested in the concepts of Moneyball, read the book first, then see this on basic cable or on Netflix (there's nothing special the big screen brings to this one). Unless she is really into baseball or Brad Pitt, do not make your wife watch it with you!",5,2,5,31 October 2011
The Finest Hours," Great depiction of the era and New England Coast Guard outposts provide foundation for harrowing rescue saga
","This movie does a magnificent job of setting the table for itself. It took me back to the early 1950's in New England without so much as an echo of a false note. The dances, the cars, the attitudes, and the not-so-esprit-de-corps-except-when-it really-counts attitude among the Guard members at the outpost are all presented with remarkable accuracy. It was just like stepping into a time capsule.I don't understand some people's criticism of the acting as wooden. I found it anything but. Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone) is a fantastic dramatic actor who is stereotyped too much from his Oceans movie roles. Here, he steels the movie from Pine, Foster, and the rest. Not that Pine and Foster were bad - they were pitch perfect as the determined and focused rescuers with lives of their own. As the Commander, Eric Bana gave the film's most thankless role everything he could.I thought Holliday Grainger was a revelation as the spunky and unconventional Miriam. The subplot with her pushiness and combativeness was well told and did an excellent job of providing context.As for the action, it was magnificent with the saga well told both in magnitude of the task, dissension on the big boat, human courage and weakness in the face of death, and of course, the rescue itself. I did go to the 3D version and the effects and motion of the waves made that well worth it for me. It is a great film for the entire family.",9,1,6,13 February 2016
The Hunger Games," Great action, acting, photography and a well-realized vision
","I had not read the book but the one I saw it with did and we both loved it. It is one of three more-than-two-hours long movies I've ever seen where I did not once look at my watch. I do not care much for Woody Harrelson but he and Lenny Kravitz were both terrific in their supporting roles and Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland took the most clichéd characters and each made them special in their own way. As for Jennifer Lawrence, this is one of the few actresses who actually deserves all the hype she's getting. She is terrific. This world creates it worlds well and balances the medieval Roman forum feel with the high-tech gadgets perfectly. I just loved it.",10,4,13,8 April 2012
The Others," Run-of-the-mill Gothic Thriller
","The performances are all marvelous -- most especially the young girl and Fionnula Flanagan.  Kidman was just a tad too flamboyant for me in spots, one scene in particular conjuring up images of Nancy Kelly in the Bad Seed -- but overall, she was more than up to the task at hand.  The suspense is real, and the visuals are quite well done.  The sound track, sound effects, make-up, and costumes are all first-rate.  But, for me, the flimsiness (these days called delicacy and cheered by critics -- all things run in cycles) of the storyline and transparency of the twists make this an unmemorable time-killer.  If you're into this kind of movie, it's probably worth an 8/10 -- for me 6/10 was the right number.",5,1,2,3 March 2004
Milk," Repetitive, preachy, and self-important
","Penn delivers another excellent performance although when I closed my eyes, the cadence of his words sounded disturbingly identical to his 'I Am Sam' title character. Josh Brolin gives an excellent and nuanced supporting turn as the tortured soul that was Dan White. James Franco and Emile Hirsch lend solid support. But, the themes and the lessons are repeated over and over and over again. For me, there was a disproportionate amount of time dwelling on the lovemaking scenes in vivid detail to the detriment of the movie's pacing. Then when we finally get to 1978 and the unfolding of the events that led to WHite's psychotic break and horrific crime, they are thrown quickly at the audience as if they were a postscript to the proceedings. Victor Garber is given absolutely NOTHING to do as Moscone. FOr the most part, I spent a lot of time looking at my watch.",4,10,21,18 June 2009
Lost in Translation," Bored in Japan as under-written and over-directed by Sofia Coppola
","Yes, Bill Murray, in a tailor-made role, is excellent and memorable. Even in a weak movie, he was probably worth of being considered for an Oscar nomination.   However, in my humble opinion, this is a wanna-be art-house film masquerading as a movie that succeeds in neither endeavor.  The Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay nominations are ridiculous.Scarlett Johanssen and Bill Murray are two bored, disaffected, cynical, and self-absorbed Americans who are emotionally distant with their spouses. We spend two hours watching them make fun of a Tokyo they refuse to make the effort to understand or get personally involved with.  He's there, his acting career 20+ years behind him, to film a series of Suntory whiskey commercials.  She's there because of her husband's work as a photographer. They make fun of friends and acquaintances and their own spouses for their superficialities. She quickly diagnoses that he is in typical middle-age male crisis; he quickly admits to it.  They poke fun at the absurdity of life, and basically enjoy a platonic 'affair' -- a loose and transitory union of two lost souls with little better to do, who recognize that misery loves company.That's it -- that's the entire script of the movie.  Period.  The rest is all 'intriguing' camera angles revealing the shallowness of Japan, about 36 of Bill Murray's best deadpan facial expressions, all three of Ms. Johanssen's facial expressions, and an uninspired soundtrack.
In short, nothing happens, and unlike better-albeit-flawed art-house films like My Dinner at Andre's, nothing intriguing or remotely philosophical is explored.  This is actually reminiscent of 1973's 'a Touch of Class' without the sex or the contrived situations.  given a choice of watching relentless ennui or sex and contrived situations, I'll take the latter every time.All of this, and most especially the absence of traditional contrivances such as plot and resolutions, makes it hip and original and a darling of the critics.  For those of us who travel for business, it's a two-hour compilation of the evenings we spent in various cities between appointments hanging out at hotel bars with nothing better to do.  This is boring in your own life and even less interesting watching two people who give you no reasons to care about them -- since they don't care about themselves or anybody else -- being even more bored.This also reminded me quite a bit of 2002's 'About Schmidt', but not quite as pathetic.  About Schmidt made an additional mistake not made here -- casting Jack Nicholson as a midwestern Mr. Everyman!I think it's ludicrous that no American female has ever been nominated for Best Director before Sofia Coppola.  The only thing more ludicrous would be if she were to win the award for this pretensiously underwritten time-waster.This should have been called Bored in Japan -- just a tad more interesting than watching your Uncle Mike's vacation movies -- and even then, only if your Uncle Mike were not played by the ever-amazing Bill Murray.  If you are an industry professional trying to impress your colleagues, you probably will enjoy 'Lost in Translation.'  If you wish to be entertained, rent something else.",3,32,58,29 February 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," Misanthropic road trip with dysfunctional family substitutes derision for wit
","Everyone I know and trust loved this movie and told me they howled with laughter. I simply do NOT get it. If you loved Borat and Napoleon Dynamite, you'll also love Little Miss Sunshine -- I suppose because they are both misanthropic comedies about stupid people. But even though I liked neither I will say that both had far better sight gags and funny albeit stupid lines than Little Miss Sunshine. Me, I really don't get the raves at all considering I think this is one of the 50 worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen.I don't find stupid people doing stupid things especially funny. I find hip pot-shots at easy targets that have been the targets of other hip comedies in the past even less funny. This movie is devoid of the delicious irony, politically savvy subtext, witty lines, or wry observations that would make a satire satirical. A wasted Alan Arkin whose physical vibrancy belies his character's supposedly frail physical condition is embarrassing to watch as a male version of Sophia of the Golden Girls who then dies in much the same way as Imogene Coca in Vacation. The ensuing problems of what to do with the body also are more crass and derisive than funny. Greg Kinnear plays the father as a cross between Bert Convy's character in Semi-Tough and Harrison Ford's character in The Mosquito Coast -- an obsessed and self-destructive self-help guru. What a novel idea, showing a self-help guru who cannot help himself, much less others, but cannot see it. That's all the humor allowed his character with no funny lines or development or delicious irony to make him interesting. The fact that Kinnear is such a good actor that he keeps struggling to find humor makes it all the more tedious. Steve Correll is making a different movie than everyone else, playing his gay, suicidal brother character absolutely straight (pun intended). I'm not a fan, but he's very good and is the only character that doesn't give the viewer the impression that he knows he's playing an object-of-scorn and derision. Toni Colette and the girl playing Olive do salvage a few funny moments at the Beauty Contest itself. But, by then, it was too late for me to care about any of the characters.It must be a generational thing. I am a 50-year old male who knows what I find funny and this certainly was not it!",1,106,197,23 January 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," Buffalo 66 re-set in Philadelphia with many more words
","Romantic? Definitely. Bizarre? Most definitely. Predictable ending? Sure. Comedy? Not the rollicking type, but in the classic sense of a non-tragedy with some amusing touches and incidents, it qualifies. Great acting? I'll take issue with consensus here - I thought Jennifer Lawrence was electric. I thought Bradley Cooper showed a bit too much physical self-control during his intense bi-polar episodes but was otherwise very good. DeNiro seemed to overlay his performance on Gazzara's in Buffalo 66. Why do I compare this film to Buffalo 66? You have an off-center protagonist coming home post-confinement with unfinished business and a chip on his shoulder. You have a dancer with some emotional damage of her own as the lead female (albeit not held hostage) against a blue- collar backdrop of economic depression and local sports hysteria. This film is less misanthropic than Buffalo 66 and has some brighter characters, making it a lot less dark overall - but many of the themes are similar - as is the unlikely romantic resolution.One major difference - Buffalo 66 nailed Buffalo - felt like buffalo during the week I spent there. I spent 10 years in Philadelphia. First, I'm unclear whether this was supposed to take place in Italian South Philadelphia or Llanarch (a suburb just outside west Philly), but the roads where he ran seemed much too wide for either and the houses and front yards were much too wide as well. Parking was too spacious. They talk about the 76 (which everyone calls the Schuylkill - or various local take-offs - school-kill, sure-kill, etc.). It passes by South Philly, but nowhere near Llanarch (they show a Llanarch Diner). DeNiro and his betting 'friend' seem right in character for South Philly. None of the other family members look or act the type particularly. Julia Stiles' character (sharp performance in a thankless role), family, and home with lawn seem more like Llanarch but the areas shown in most of the running sequences don't match. Then the Indian bus and the parking lot brawl seemed way too staged and forced. Unlikely that just getting off the bus - a bus they've seen before and had a friend of one of their group on it - would precipitate such a brawl. So, for those who trumpet how realistic this movie was, I found the depiction of Philly and its dysfunctional sports fanatics to be totally off. Invincible did a much better job of depicting these folk as they are. The story in Invincible was more credible also. I lived there during the Vince Papale years.All that said, I generally wouldn't get so deep into a romantic comedy but this one is considered very special and ground-breaking in its characterizations. It is a good movie and does an acceptable job to me of characterizing one person with one manifestation of bi-polar disorder, his friends, and his sports-crazy dad for me to enjoy. I'd have been interested in learning a bit more about Lawrence's character's post-traumatic nymphomania and its treatment since this too can be a real dysfunction but that was glossed over and I only accepted it because of the fire in the belly Lawrence displayed. Her subtle traits and occasional physical ticks lent credibility to me.So, overall, I enjoyed this somewhat Hollywood-ized and somewhat clichéd but still highly thoughtful and enjoyable movie. Certainly, I've found many less engaging ways to spend two hours in a movie theater in the past 10 years.",7,1,2,21 January 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," Absolutely Remarkable Movie and Performances
","I am avid movie lover and have seen more than 2,000 movies in my tome - and remember most of them. The best male lead performance I have ever seen is Paul Schofield in a Man For All Seasons. In second place, I had Paul Lukas in Watch on the Rhine - until now. I've long liked McConnaughy and found him very impressive in We Are Marshall and The Lincoln Lawyer. Neither performance set me up for this. His every mannerism, every nuance, every way of carrying himself in every scene and every situation is utterly on target. This is a terrific movie and almost the entire cast is flawless but the lead performance is truly in a class by itself.The next point I wish to make is that this is one of the few of the very many independent movies I've seen that involved HIV and the gay community without hitting the viewer over the head with it even though it was 100% central to the plot. What I mean is that there was none of the normal obligatory gilding of the lily just to make sure the viewer gets the message.Also interesting is the fact that both McConnaughy and Leto (also 100% Oscar-worthy) manage to play larger-than-life characters convincingly without ever acting larger-than-life. It's a subtlety and rare that actors can play such characters without chewing up the scenery but both manage somehow to do it which speaks quite well for the director. The pacing is considerably better than most indies or Hollywood non- action dramas. I only looked at my watch once. Griffin Dunne is noteworthy in his supporting performance. Jennifer Garner is far better than in the last movie she did about battling Big Pharma, Love and Other Drugs. She still tries a quarter-of-an-octave too hard, but that's really getting picky in one of the best movies I've seen in this century thus far.",10,2,3,8 March 2014
Mamma Mia!," Fun - but only if you are so inclined - and it probably helps to be over 45
","I saw the musical late in its run and thought it was a lot of good fun - nothing spectacular, but highly enjoyable. I enjoyed ABBA music though the group was never in my top 5. In that context, if you are looking for a movie with hilarious ABBA music send-ups and weddings, I would highly recommend the late 90's Australian satire Muriel's Wedding that helped springboard Toni Colette and Rachel Griffiths to well-deserved international stardom.That said, I enjoyed the movie Mamma Mia as an enjoyable way to spend 110 minutes.In contrast to the show, the movie gave us almost no interaction with two of the three potential fathers having dismissed them to her friends as flings. Hence, the heart-string tugs from the play were absent and it also spoiled any dramatic build-up to Sam stepping up to the plate at the end. I seem to be alone in thinking that Brosnan did a fantastic acting job of melting into the character of Sam rather than being Pierce Brosnan for a change. Given how little he was given to do, it probably wasn't worth it, but I thought it was worth noting. Colin Firth also, as usual, got the most out of Harry Headbanger despite his reduced air time. On the other hand, the choice of the balding and paunchy Swedish actor from the Intruders and Good Will Hunting as Bill was totally bewildering to me. He seemed totally miscast in the role and half a sleep in the little we dis see of him, mostly in his number with the irrepressible Julie Walters.This brings us to what to watch and enjoy about Mamma Mia. All the scenes with Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are hysterically funny, wonderfully choreographed, and joys to behold. Streep has marvelous chemistry with them that is sorely lacking with any of the three gentlemen. Streep was certainly interesting here, often going from heartbroken and disconsolate to joyful and exuberant in a blink of an eye. It was almost like watching an acting class exercise set to music. And after all, who could possibly do it better? Sophie was well portrayed and the fellow playing was better treated by the screenplay than any other male in the film and took more-than-adequate advantage of it. Normally, I'm not a fan of overblown and surreal production numbers but the literal Greek Chorus made the musical cast of hundreds in the background into good fun.So, enjoy Mamma Mia for what it is if you are so inclined. If you are under 30, male, and can't stand ABBA music, go see Transformers 3 instead.",6,0,1,2 January 2009
Non-Stop," Well-paced entertainment
","This has a lot more suspense and is faster-paced than Neeson's last 3 films I saw: Taken 2; Unknown; and The Grey. In fact, it reminded me a bit more of Unstoppable in its pacing and tone. It is exciting and well- acted. Most of all, it's fun to watch. It all strains credibility at time. It's interesting to me that the denouement is not so much to stop the board on exploding but to get the plane down to an elevation where the pressure has a chance of stabilizing and minimizing the loss of life -a different twist. The way in which Neeson becomes everybody's prime suspect and then recovers - which is the bulk - of the film is clever and suspenseful. If you like Neeson and you lie heroic action-suspense movies - especially in the theater -yo will enjoy this. If you like neither Neeson nor his version of the genre which always calls for you to suspend a bit of credibility, then why did you bother to see this anyway?",8,0,2,2 March 2014
Gone Girl," Unique and meticulously crafted spider web transcends genres
","I did not read the book of know anything about Gillian Flynn beyond the fact that she adapted her book for the movies screenplay. Therefore, I did not realize that this would be more for my money than an excellent suspense thriller or a did-he or didn't he movie. This turned out to be such a clever and meticulous spider web of plotting and counter-plotting, that it was difficult to keep up with all of its twists and turns. What made it especially difficult to keep up with once we were an hour into the film was that I kept laughing from the pitch-dark American-values comedy that flowed naturally from the situations and character's motivations. If you enjoy intricate plots that are perfectly executed and a thinking person's thriller, you will not be disappointed. If you also enjoy movies that comment on the absurdities of society and marriage and the needs to please the masses, you will be even more happily surprised. And if you like movies with great co-star performances and great supporting performances all around, you will love this movie. On the other hand, if you want a reality escape where the good guys are all good and the bad guys are all bad, skip Gone Girl and go see The Equalizer or A Walk Among the Tombstones. This movie requires all of your gray matter to appreciate it.",10,1,12,4 October 2014
The Theory of Everything," The Theory of Everything - Magnificent Acting and Intriguing Story - But Oh, that monotonous score
","Herb Blank Head, Business Development and Managing Director, ESG Solutions Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are nothing short of remarkable in the Theory of Everything. The supporting cast, cinematographic innovations, and costuming were all excellent. I learned a lot and recommend it fairly highly. However, the tedious piano score, relentless throughout, really started alternatively putting me to sleep and getting on my nerves. I know many of today's young filmmakers and critics have a disdain for overly dramatic scores. I don't personally but either way - this was truly the other extreme! The only other nit I'll pick I recognize as representative of the fact that I am from a prior generation. I found the dialog overly spartan and a lot of story blanks deliberately unexplained. To me and I daresay others from my generation, this creates distance and makes personal emotional involvement difficult. That said, I am aware enough of both the subject matter and today's artistic and industry standards to believe that was exactly what James Marsh had in mind. I've often heard today's highly regarded filmmakers and 'experts' express disdain for verbal storytelling insisting that really talented directors should emphasize imagery and the visuality of the medium over story exposition. For those people in the reviews I've read, the DIrector didn't go far enough in that direction so I should be grateful - and I am. There also is a marvelous scene where Jane tells her mother (who inadvertently starts the new Chapter in Jane's life with the choirmaster) that 'She's never heard anything so English in her life.' So indeed, the lack of outward emotion expressed on film and the economic and sterile dialog is quite illustrative of a very English family background and Cambridge-educated gentry. It also is consistent with the recurrent subtext of the film contrasting Jane's C-of-E morality and natural proclivity toward adherence to standards of decorum with Hawking's personal immaturity (dictated by circumstances), unconventionality and unrepentant atheism. So the understatement is quite appropriate especially from Jane's lens which is how we get to view most of what unfolds. In short, I have to recognize that James Marsh did a superb job of conveying in cinema the subtext of the film. So, I conclude that most of IMDb will appreciate what I found detracted just a bit from my personal enjoyment. But that's quite trivial overall. I enjoyed the movie and think most will as well.",8,1,3,2 December 2014
World Trade Center," Taut, straightforward, uplifting, and heartfelt
","World Trade Center does an excellent job of allowing us to see and feel the harrowing details over 24 hours of a Port Authority Police First Response team and the subsequent efforts to extricate its survivors. The effects on families and co-workers are also absorbingly realized. The pacing is excellent and music and camera angles keep us focused and are never intrusive. Only backdrop events immediately pertinent to the team and the rescue efforts are shown. The acting is uniformly excellent, with Michael Pena a standout. I am not a huge Nicholas Cage fan, but he was so good that while watching the film, I continually thought of him as Sgt. John McLoughlin and not as Nicholas Cage. For me, that is a high compliment indeed. Gregory Jbarra and Maggie Gyllenhall also deliver memorable performances. The only performance that bothered me slightly was Donna Bello's affectations as Cage's wife, but she probably had one of the film's more difficult roles in trying to balance her persona's natural reserve against the cataclysmic events of the day.Certainly, this is the tightest and least self-indulgent piece of film-making Oliver Stone has ever done. I defy anyone honest to find any indirect (certainly no direct) political statements being made here at all. This film is all about courage and valor in the most trying of circumstances. I recommend highly to all, most especially those who want to put the events of the day behind them as I believe they will find this movie to be a cathartic experience.",9,3,8,14 August 2006
Friends with Benefits," Actors talk at people, not to them
","This is the movie for the video generation - all flash mobs and photography. Some very good actors (Emma Stone, Patricia Clarkson, and Richard Jenkins) do their best with clichéd caricature actors (the shrewish ex-girlfriend, the lost-in-the-70's mom; and the father with Alzheimiers with a propensity for taking his pants off. Only Jenna Elfman as Timberlake's sister comes off as an actual human being. Woody Harrelson is horribly one-note as the obsessively gay sports Editor but it's okay because he's hip. This movie tries to be as hip as it can be by pretending to be a spoof on Hollywood Romantic comedies while actually making one. But, it's not really a romantic comedy at all despite the tacked-on cliché ending. It's really vulgar.They talk at each other saying inappropriate things and never listening to each other. Both are gorgeous - I'll give them that. But, that's just about all. Their love-making sessions include some crude exchanges and interludes with Timberlake's slapstick routing about a male situation making it too hard to urinate normally chewing up about 4 minutes of film time. I've seen some reviews saying that the two leads had great chemistry. As far as I could tell the two were filmed separately, then spliced together. In a similarly themed movie, Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman had 100 times the chemistry these two did. Of course, Portman is a much more profound actress than the flippant Kunis (see Black Swan).Okay, that's probably enough. I wasted nearly 2 hours of my life watching this so I need spend no more time on it now.",2,15,26,27 December 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Not bad - Stewart's Best, Pattinson's weakest
","I thought this was a fitting enough end for the saga - particularly the last 30 - 40 minutes. I also enjoyed seeing the 'newborn' vampire hunt and found that intriguing. Jacob and Kristen Stewart are given string characters and plenty to do and they do it very well. Stewart also exhibits an energy level and sexuality here far beyond anything we've seen before - and it's exciting to watch. On the other hand, Edward is SO weak in this one - he's far weaker than the baby or anything else. I'm not talking about Pattinson's performance - which I found adequate - but how weak his character was in this one and how much he more than anybody needed Her protection. Overall, it was an imaginative, if episodic, way to end the series.",7,4,11,24 November 2012
Reservoir Dogs," Intriguing low-budget caper film stalls midway through
","Reservoir Dogs starts off intriguingly enough. It's a perfect crime caper that goes horribly awry. It's a joy to see Lawrence Tierney as the honcho putting it all together and the late Christopher Penn gave his best performance on film as his son. I must differ with other comments on Tim Roth. With his on-and-off British accent and giveaway expressions even when Harvey Keitel is trusting him, I thought his performance was the weakest in the film. Speaking of Harvey Keitel, he and Buscemi play the yin and yang of professional criminals with Masden somehow providing the perfect perpendicular middle ground to each. So far so good. The violence goes with today's exposition of the genre so it neither bothered me as it did others nor did it inspire genius-worship; it was just part of the accouterments of this movie as far as I was concerned. *** here's where the spoilers come in *** What did bother me was Masden, very bright otherwise, being stupid enough to let Roth get the drop on him and kill him. At this point, the movie delivers 15 minutes of monotony and a pointless flashback to how Roth insinuated himself into the caper. Finally, Tierney and Penn arrive. The climax is well executed and the 'moral' is delicious.If you are a professional criminal, be professional. Do not let any human frailties, emotions, loyalties, or senses of right and wrong interfere with your execution. There is no place for humanity in the life of a professional criminal.So, overall, RD is an average low-budget caper film with moments of brilliance and a lot of flaws. It probably deserves a 6.5 from me rather than a 5, but seeing it with an 8.4 and listed as one of the top 100 movies of all time made me feel obligated to try to balance it out a bit.",5,1,3,5 July 2006
Some Like It Hot," Rapid-Fire Comedy Classic
","In drag or drab, Lemmon & Curtis are marvelous together.  Monroe's chemistry was terrific and natural for both of them, and Joan Shawlee never missed a chance to strut her stuff as Sorority Sue.  The gags are riotous, the dialogue rich with jokes and film in-jokes, some subtle, some not-so-subtle. Joe E. Brown, mugging unabashedly, steals every scene he is.  His tango with Lemmon is priceless.  Georgie Raft does such an accurate deadpan spoof of himself that you're not quite sure whether he gets the jokes.  He did. Nehemiah Persoff excels as Li'l Bonaparte.  Another thing here is that the singing, enjoyable and untaxing, never gets in the way of the plot, and the pacing is frenetic throughout.  the guys-in-drag bit had not been done before in a manner of such heartfelt empathy as Jack Lemmon gives it --Treat yourself to this one; it deserves its reputation as one of the top comedy classics of all time.",10,1,2,3 March 2004
Zero Dark Thirty," Cohesive narrative with terrific acting a bit long and episodic but mostly worth it
","Jessica Chastain gives a magnificent and unforgettable performance as the obsessed CIA Agent Maya. As a rule, I do not care for long movies and I found Bigelow's Hurt Locker slow and unsatisfying even though much shorter than ZDT. However, even though this is more character study than action, I only looked at my watch once, The tale is told in rather episodic fashion but the episodes are gripping - especially the two surrounding Jenifer Ehle who was terrific. The length of the film seems paced to make us feel the frustration and endless desperation ans single-mindedness experienced by Maya. Kyle Chandler is well cast as her bureaucratic boss who is done in by her over-zealous maneuvers. The movie depicts Maya as a flawed heroine. It also shows the rather brutal assault on the Bin Laden house where the wives are fair game to be shot at blindly - the end of getting Bin Laden justifying the means. An aside, I was as against the wars then as I am now and my feelings about the techniques used NOT being justified by 9/11 are the polar opposite of Maya's. But in telling her story, I don't believe this movie chronicling her exhausting and obsessive pursuit of Bin Laden glorifies the American war efforts. I think it tells the story objectively showing why the Americans were so unpopular and accurately depicting the intelligence-in-the field process. In now way do I see this as the propaganda movie others here reported - not at all. I just experienced a well-told and well-acted series of failed operations ultimately resulting in the successful killing of Bin Laden but at considerable costs of lives, money, and international goodwill.

Love Actually," Facile and muddled, yet pleasant and amusing enough
","The DVD analysis and out-takes make a few things clear.  The writer-director had a great many ideas, some brilliant, many overblown, but far too many to be contained in a two-hour-and-eight-minute-and-at-that-still-too-long commercially aimed holiday movie.  One of the sad results is that the five out-takes included on the DVD would have been five of the best 8 scenes in the movie.  apparently, nearly three-and-a-half hours were filmed and the editing obviously turned into a 'team effort' in the absolute worst sense of the term.One theme, almost a mantra to the people involved with the film, is that these were all conceptually variations on one basic story, with common threads from the global tapestry of love.  This is great stuff for film school, but in direct conflict with what studio executives think there audiences want to see when they come out to see a romantic comedy at holiday time.  And, this time, the execs are probably closer to what's best for the film than the creative geniuses who can no longer see the forest -- but they are hooked totally on commercial viability.With 20-20 hindsight, the problems are easy to see. Most simply, eight-plus stories are at least two-plus too many.  Unfortunately, the two weakest and most peripheral stories also had the hottest and most marquee-worthy names. Somewhere there may be a brilliant movie waiting to be made with UK Prime Minister Hugh Grant refusing to continue being a lap dog for US President Billy Bob Thornton after the latter puts the make on an office girl that the former had his eye on.  But, it would require much more emphasis on governmental and global issues that did not belong in this movie -- with the result that, really, none of this belonged in the movie.  But, how can you cut out Hugh Grant's character and keep the film commercially viable?  You can't -- but since the format allows for no expansion of the complications of such a romance for a Prime Minister, you are left with a subplot with little to offer beyond the charm of the two principals portraying the actors.   Similarly, the Colin Firth character was supposed to connect somehow to Alan Rickman's character's mistress -- who in turn -- would have supplied some important insights.  Without them, we have the ugly Briton in the South of France trying to write a novel with a Portuguese 'beauty' who speaks no English and is as shallow as a wading pool. So, we get Colin Firth's considerable panache, a bunch of forgettable slapstick and even more forgettable wistfulness, an enjoyably choreographed --if overblown -- march through a Portuguese village, and a waste of 25-or-so all-too-valuable minutes of the movie's run-time.  There's a bittersweet subplot with a wedding photographer that doesn't quite belong in the pastiche in the manner intended. The subplot with the overdependent brother ruining a love-life via cellphone falls flat quickly as well.   The shame is that stripping these excess threads out would have allowed the film's true gems and interesting vignettes (Liam Neeson & son, Rickman & Thompson's entire family, the sex doubles, the singer-manager duo, and the stud with the American dream and his nay-saying friend) to keep their more memorable scenes and weave more seamlessly into the director's intended tapestry.Okay, so much for the movie that did not get to be released.  I believe that one that did get released did retain the writer-director's pervasive message of the delightful incongruities of the 'family holiday' aspects of Christmas contrasted against all the commercial selling of sex concurrently airing during the period whilst adult sex-party games are in full force.  Too bad these messages are not nearly as insightful or revelatory as intended. Worse, including all these smutty references -- irrespective of motivation -- limits its accessibility to an 8-to-14-year-old holiday audience that would have otherwise found much to enjoy.In summary, Love Actually is full of flaws and misfires.  The closer you get to the movie, the more you'll see them.  But, if your looking for a pleasant enough pastiche of attractive people delivering witty and urbane dialog in a pleasant setting with a great soundtrack -- then put down your critic's pencil, check your brains, grab someone you love, and enjoy Love Actually.My score: 7/10.  By the way, if you enjoyed Hugh Grant in this film, make certain you see the far-better About A Boy from 2002.  He's terrific in the comedy, and the film is quite a bit of fun for all but the most extremely hypercritical or for avid haters of Mr. Grant.",7,2,6,9 May 2004
12 Years a Slave," A Compelling Experience with Excellent Acting
","I found the story compelling and the acting excellent with perhaps two exceptions. Ejiofor and N'yongo both delivered breath-taking and heart- wrenching performances that deserve their many accolades and then some. The supporting work from Woodard, Oduye, Brown, and especially Topsy Chapman who does more with her face, body movements, and singing than anyone else does with dialog also kept the film poignant. Cumberbatch and Dano deserve the credit they have gotten for solid supporting performances of characters with layered dimensions. Brad Pitt also executes well the plum supporting role he gave himself. Berry, Chalk, Giamatti, McConnell, Dilahunt, Evermore, and Dylan all score in the one or two scenes in which they are featured. The cinematography and score are both terrific and give the film vitality to take us through the torturous moments. The costume design also deserved its Oscar nomination. I found McQueen's direction compelling throughout save two scenes I found extraneous just showing weary facial expressions.Unlike others, I was less than impressed with the performances by Michael Fassbender & Sarah Paulson (an actor whose accolades I've never understood) as Mr. & Mrs. Epps. They seemed jarringly out-of-era to me in all expressions and mannerisms. Owners of large and profitable plantations of that era, even evil ones, would have more of an air of dignity - especially when dealing with the Judge and the Sheriff. Instead, Epps makes no apologies for being rough-hewn, petty, cynical, and bitter in front of the Judge and others. Evil, believing his slaves to be no more human than baboons, sure. Displaying less couth than an overseer with his fellow planters and in front of other whites? Not a chance. His biblical interpretation for his slaves was probably his best scene. But he is just too banal and vulgar 'in public' in the others. And you'd have to comb deep and far to find a planter's wife as emaciated and as publicly shrill as Sarah Paulson. Her bearing is just all wrong. I also would have liked to have seen some speculation on what Northrup's family was doing during those 12 years. That may not be covered in the memoir but this is a work of fiction based on a true incident - not a documentary (Why the sudden critics of the excellent MOVIE Captain Phillips could not see that and why they got to wield so much influence, I'll never understand - as good as McQueen's direction is here, Greengrass surpasses it in Phillips). Anyway, 12 Years a Slave is a worthy enough candidate in its own right. Not perfect but certainly very good, possibly excellent.",8,0,2,27 January 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," Well-directed and well-acted voyeurism delivers well on its objective
","I come to the movies to be entertained. I was very much entertained. I came this movie partially to see a character study featuring a virgin on the verge of college graduation coming of age at the hands of a self-advertised millionaire sadist who considers himself soulless. That is precisely what i got. THe other attraction of this movie, of course, was the opportunity to watch B & D sex set against a trashy love/lust story. This obviously is not for all tastes but just as obviously, given the box office, attracts many and half of the people I know who went once have now gone twice. I see a lot of IMDb critics giving this movie one star on the basis of calling it soft porn. I won't deny that this film is right on the edge of soft porn and that if you don't like voyeuristic sex and soft porn, you should not go into the theater. Is there anyone who bought a ticket who did not know to expect 'the sexual abuse of a young woman being used as supposed entertainment.' I read this quote verbatim in at least three reviews. Like anything else, if you know you find such things so abhorrent, that's all you'll think about, then you SHOULD NOT GO to see this film.Me, I like well-made soft-porn laced with occasional humor. As someone with what I consider a healthy and open-to-anything libido, I also enjoy watching naked bodies engage in kinky sex, especially when set up properly. For this kind of movie, the direction was incredibly crisp and cogent. Christian Grey was exactly the menacing, narcissistic yet charming control freak he was supposed to be. I found it impossible not to be overwhelmed and seduced by his power. I certainly found it easy to believe that Dakota Johnson would be. Marcia Gay Harden's brief turn as Grey's adopted mother is wonderful. Even the many one-star haters seem to indicate that the direction and pacing (fantastic in my opinion) were not bad. I would say the best I've ever seen in a borderline soft-porn movie and among the best I've every seen for a trashy love story (Think Butterfly, The Other Side of Midnight, and Once is Not Enough). I'd also ask how a movie with decent direction could get ONE star (3 o4 4 would be more reasonable). I reserve ONE STAR for total disasters with totally incompetent direction like Homer and Eddie. This was slick, well-directed, and in my opinion (perhaps the biggest actually pertinent major disagreement with the critics) uniformly well-acted especially by the supporting cast and Johnson. I also did find the chemistry electric with Jamie properly stiff when he found himself confused by letting Anastasia into a heart he had blockaded and a soul he was convinced he didn't have.As for the bodies shown, the nudity, the devices, and the choreography of the sex, I've never seen better. One problem I generally have with the borderline soft porn genre is spending two much time on mechanics. Most movies based on trashy novels also spend too much time dwelling on emotionally ravaged faces not quite executed bu mediocre actors. This movie never stopped coming at you with excitement, intrigue, and sex long enough to stagnate like that. So, I had a great time and enjoyed it thoroughly and most of the 100+ women and 8 other men in the audience seemed to enjoy it on that basis as well. After all, they got what they knew they were coming to see.",8,3,7,23 February 2015
Bruce Almighty," Adequate comedy-fantasy
","This is an fast-moving and engaging comedy-fantasy with enough gags that work well to make you overlook the equally abundant duds and the relentless lack of restraint applied to Carrey's performance by both director and actor.  There's no question that Carrey is a genius at goofy comedy, but even genius must be applied appropriately. The rest of the cast fares much better. Morgan Freeman is, of course, magnificent as the Almighty feeling the need to teach Bruce some humility. His scenes are the best in the film.  Catherine Bell (from TV's 'Jag') is both provocative and luminescent as the co-anchor Susan Ortega.  She gives memorable dimensionality to what could have been a caricature.  Jennifer Aniston continues to prove her mettle as a versatile and aware leading lady. She is perfectly aware that she is merely the obligatory lead female in Carrey's star vehicle, but puts her all into fleshing out Grace as an independent person that we care about.  Philip Baker Hall and Sally Kirkland are solid in important supporting roles while Tony Bennett has a fun cameo.Given the plot's immense possibilities, I am disappointed that the movie chose to channel its energies so narrowly, but at least, in doing so, it made me laugh.  I give it 6/10.",6,1,2,27 June 2004
The Producers," Hilarious madcap warped and deeply disturbed comic genius
","Mostel and Wilder's Bialystock and Blum are the immortal producing duo of all-time.  This film misfires on ten or eleven jokes, which just leaves 88,000 brilliant laughs.  Dick Shawn, Christopher Hewitt, Kenneth Mars, and Lee Meredith all do what they can do to steal the scenes they are in.  But, not with Zero on center stage.",10,0,1,27 April 2002
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Satisfactory Sequel - a bridge from Hunger Games to Mocking Jay
","I truly think that the original, The Hunger Games, as a film, irrespective of what one thinks of its fidelity to the book, is a modern classic. I thought it realized its dystopic future world beautifully and tragically with impeccable and well-conceived costume design, set design, acting, and script. It was fully contained within itself even though they knew when filming it that it was the first book of a trilogy and were already planning to do a sequel. I consider the first one to be at a minimum, a top 500 all-time movie. I just saw Catching Fire. I enjoyed it for what it was - about a 7 on a scale of 10. It is NOT a stand-alone movie but a good installment of a superior serial. It rather mirrors the 2nd episode of other sci- fi/fantasy trilogies such as the original Star Wars (now 4,, 5, and 6) - very much in the dark vein of The Empire Strikes Back. Also comparable to the middle Rings movie and to a lesser extent, Back to the Future II. The acting in Catching Fire is still terrific. The new parts of the set design all underscore the darkness of President Snow's reactionary reaction to what happened in the first movie. Not that much new in costume design, but still fine. But it seems much more repetitive and the Games themselves much less suspenseful than the original tableau. Like most serials, the first 20% is spent bringing the viewers who missed or forgot what happened the first time back up to date. In short, if you were expecting Catching Fire to be another modern classic in the league of The Hunger Games, you'll be disappointed. If you are expecting installment II of a serial - a bridge to take you from Hunger Games to Mocking Jay, than you have a perfectly fine version of that.",7,1,15,30 November 2013
Cinderella Man," Overlong biopic with historical inaccuracies is redeemed somewhat by performances
","A lot of my problems with this movie has to do with me and the fact that I am part of a bygone generation.I found this picture an ordeal to watch during most of its first 90 minutes. Yes, I understand that it takes place during the Great Depression. But, I didn't need Director Howard to actually immerse me in scene after scene of Depression-era bleakness to understand what that meant. I am also from the era where clever rapid-fire dialog gave a boxing movie its pace and rhythm. Today's movie-making seems to consider it a badge of honor to use as little dialog and as many visuals with music as possible. If this was a boxing movie from that era, it would have run 105 minutes at most, not 144 minutes. I also found Crowe's mumbling very hard to understand (probably time that I got an ear trumpet).Finally, the portrayal of Max Baer by Craig Bielko seemed unlike the Baer I've seen interviewed and in movies. The 'Jewish Bomber' as he was known (and at his comedic best in Africa Screams with A & C) was generally witty and fairly soft-spoken for a boxer. I knew of one lethal incident (need to check on the other) but he was very humble about that, not bragging. And, he was not known as the talker and showman in the ring as depicted. Unless someone has other info, I believe that this was all the invention of this movie.All this said, in the scenes in which he is audible, Crowe is magnificent, and Giamatti is even better. Zellweger -- one of the top actresses of her generation in my opinion -- has a rather thankless character and makes her as human as possible. Bruce McGill and others as already noted also provide excellent support. And, I simply loved Rance Howard, Ron's father, as a cynical announcer. In the end, the triumph of James J. Braddock is well-told once the story threads win out in importance over the Depression-era atmosphere.",6,3,5,5 July 2006
