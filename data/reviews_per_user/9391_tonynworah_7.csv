The Devil's Advocate," They won't see this coming!
","'They don't see me coming' In essence, that captures the strategy of the devil. We never see that evil ancient fella coming until it is too late. And that was one of the philosophies guiding the Devil charmingly played by Al Pacino. The advice is given to his protégé Kevin Lomax a brilliant and ambitious lawyer who has never lost a case.The Devil's Advocate is a guilty pleasure that will surely offend puritan Christians. The Firm meets Angel Heart. Keanu Reeves is Kevin Lomak a Southern lawyer seduced by a very rich New York law firm headed by the mysterious John Milton(Al Pacino). It is the dream of every young professional. A huge salary, a large apartment, designer suits, flashy cars, the whole perks. In the background is his sexy wife (Charlize Theron)who is the first target of the the law firm, and his Christian mother who has a deep secret of her own.All these characters will eventually collide in their course to find different types of redemption starting from when Lomax agrees to work for the firm. The horror of what he has gotten himself into slowly begins to unwind and the watchers are drawn into the eternal metaphorical saga of the battle between good and evil.The strenght in this movie lies squarely on the indomitable shoulders of Good Old Pacino. His performance was certainly dazzling, even though a little bit over the top sometimes. It was obvious that he was enjoying his role as Old Nick. His presence on the screen was mesmerizing and his lines, were outrageous, disturbing, profane and yet spellbinding.He was ably supported by Charlize Theron who keeps on proving that she is more than just a pretty face. Her evolution from a woman excited at her husband's sudden success to a terrified screaming lunatic was top shot. That woman can act! To me the film's greatest shortcoming was Keanu Reeves himself. He has never impressed me with his thespian skills, and true to form his performance was just average.But still the film is great with less emphasis on special effects and certainly no horrifying creature lurking around the corner. Instead the film eschewed violence to rely on the story itself to thrill us.And it did.",8,1,2,8 November 2010
The King's Speech," Simply a Gem
","Despite the hype, I was not really interested in watching the King's Speech being more of a thriller/horror/action/sci-fi/buff. But when I did watch it, I could then understand what the hype is all about.Once in a while, comes a film which is almost flawless, a delight to watch, an event that relies more on the story telling, superb acting and excellent directing than on any other movie gimmick.In this circle of movies, you get such ultimate experiences like The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption, The Usual Suspects, The Hunt for Red October etc. Films that prove you do not need action or sex or vampires or boy wizards or hobbits to make a good story.The King's Speech definitely belongs to this movie treasures.It tells the unlikely friendship that develops between King George VI (formerly Prince Albert), a stammerer and his unorthodox speech therapist, Lionel Louge.It is in the mid to late 30s. England is on the brink of war. The shadow of Hitler is looming over the West while that of Stalin's is creeping from the East.England desperately needs to look up to their leaders for hope but even at the top, there is turmoil. The Prime Minister keeps on downplaying the menace of Hitler to the not so gullible citizens. King George V is an old sick man and relies on his two sons to hold up the country's morale and maintain their faith in the monarchy.Alas, the elder son Edward has gained the disfavour of both his own family and the British Government because of his relationship with an American twice divorcée called Wallis Simpson. This liaison is threatening his ascension to the throne.The younger son, Prince Albert (or Bertie) as his speech therapist insists on calling him has a serious speech defect that hinders his public speaking, and makes him afraid of making public appearances. If his country cannot hear his voice, how can he govern and lead them in this dark hour? Enter his wife, Queen Elizabeth played by Helen Bonham Carter who plays the role with a fine restrained and quiet dignity. She introduces the Prince to the therapist and what follows is a strong compelling drama of quirky friendship and courage.It was amusing to watch the quiet face off between the two men. At first, Louge (Geoffrey Rush)observes his new patient with a sense of bemused curiosity while Prince Albert regards his therapist with distrust and suspicion. It is highly enjoyable to watch the budding wariness between the two men develop into an awkward endearing friendship.Colin Firth plays the stammering Prince Albert to a hilt. It is no wonder that he won an Oscar for his performance. I enjoyed watching his initial pomposity towards his therapist which sometimes changes to hostility or irritation and gradually turns to reluctant acceptance.Geoffrey Rush was the perfect complement to Colin Firth. Both men were simply amazing and show why they are among the most versatile actors in the industry. His dry wit in the film reminded me of his stellar performance as the deranged Marquie De Sade in Quills.Both men were strongly supported by Helen Boham Carter and Guy Pearce who plays the Prince Edward that abdicated his throne for the American. Mrs. Simpson. Pearce was a delight to watch and a scene stealer in every scene he appeared. I'm sure he had a lot of fun playing this complex man that abandoned his royal duties because of love, or for as Helen Carter scathingly and uncharitably puts it, 'the skills acquired at an establishment in Shangai'.Tom Hooper did a masterful job in directing this movie. And it helped that he had a wonderful script written by the talented David Seidler.Now if only the duo will team up to give us movies about Edward & Mrs. Simpson or Prince Charles & Lady Diana, or hell!, even Prince William & Kate Middleton!",9,0,0,11 May 2011
Changeling," Oscar deserving movies
","Clint Eastwood once again has delivered another powerful drama in this movie about a missing child and the lengths a mother will go to to find her child even if it means taking a whole corrupt police force that has no qualms for unauthorized executions or sending women to mental institutions simply because they can.Eastwood has proved again that he is a master director in the likes of Scorsese and Ron Howard. His attention to details, the accurate presentation of the the 1920s, his skill in getting the best performances from the actors were excellent. Another strong point in his favour was that he resisted the temptation to turn this into a global conspiracy thriller. There was suspense of course, villains, unlikely heroes, allies as well as enemies but all this blended perfectly with the plot.The story concerns a missing child. As the mother, Christine Collins is going out of her mind with worry about her son's disappearance, she receives a visit from the police that her son has been found and this is when the real problem starts.The woman claims that the boy they found is not her son and the police Captain J.J. James(chillingly played to a hilt by Jefferey Donovan)insists that they found the right boy. I'm sure the question the audience will be asking themselves is, is there a deliberate conspiracy by the police or just a case of mistaken identity or is the woman deranged? Angelina Jolie initially would have not been my first choice for such a sensitive role but I have to admit that her performance was flawless. This woman can act. Her pain, fears, frustrations, strenght was there for the audience to see. I have read other critics that she was crying too much. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? The woman is looking for her child. Do you expect her to play cards and smile all the time. Jolie gave a realistic portrayal of a woman looking for her child. She certainly deserved an Oscar for this.John Malkovitch also gave a good, if not first class performance, as the reverend who offers to help the grief stricken mother.But special mention must be made of James Butler Harner who plays the the psychotic Gordon Northcott. That guy really gave me the spooks.Michael Kelly as the unlikely hero also gave a well delivered performance.But the real stars are the real characters that this movies is based on. The mother, the reverend, the missing boy who risked (and possibly sacrificed) his life to save another, the detective who blew open the case, and the lawyer who represented the mother pro bono. These guys were heroes. I wish there can be more of them. The world will definitely be a better place.",9,2,6,24 November 2010
The Exorcist," A Horrifying Experience
","Up till now, I still rank The Exorcist as one of the most terrifying movies in cinematic history, even by today's standards. As the film blatantly implies, the movie is about an exorcist (two actually) and his heroic attempt in trying to save a girl under the influence of demonic possession.From the opening credits superimposed on a black background with a subtly chilling score, to the eerie opening sequence of an archaeological dig in the Middle East, the films lets you know you are in for a disturbing experience. The movie cuts to Washington, to the suburbia home Chris Macneil, an actress and a divorced(Big Surprise!) mother, where some disturbances begin to occur. Soon she will be forced to realize that her 12 year old daughter Regan, has been possessed by an ancient evil.She enlists the help of Father Karras, another disturbed soul who has his own demons to exorcise (figuratively this time) who in turn calls in famous exorcist Father Merrin, finely played by the legendary Max Von Sydow.All the major characters put in superb performances. We share the frustrated agonies of Chris Macneil (Ellen Burstyn) as she tries to move earth and then heaven to save her daughter, first seeking medical help and eventually, resorting to a God she does not believe in. The acting of Jason Miller and Sydow was restrained but mainly because of the taciturn characters they both played. But that does not in anyway reduce the impact of their performance. Without saying anything, you can see the fears on Karras' face as he doubts his ability to save the girl.But the true star in this movie was Linda Blair who played the possessed Regan. She played her character to the hilt. I do not believe there has been any other evil child character that has been portrayed more convincingly or more scarily.The only drawback I can see in this film is the detective character played by Lee J. Cobbs. His character did not really advance the plot and seemed to drag the film a bit. But I think the director wanted to stick the film as faithfully as possible to the book. And he did. Willian Friedkin did a masterful job and paid attention to some minor details of the book such as the fighting dogs and the desecration of the statue of the Virgin Mary. I still believe that the Exorcist is his best movie and it was a good thing that the studio hired the Exorcist author to write the screenplay or otherwise we would have likely had a hatchet job.37 years after this movie was made, it is still an entertaining chiller and epitomizes the eternal struggle (or if you must, the spiritual warfare) between good and evil.The movie's success spawned two lousy sequels that nearly destroyed the legendary status of the original movie. I cannot believe that the great Richard Burton and the iconic James Earl Jones agreed to appear in Exorcist 2. It was a really horrible movie.Much later, they tried to restore the franchise by making a prequel called The Exorcist: The Beginning. It was a valiant attempt but still does not hold a candle to the original.",9,0,1,8 November 2010
The Usual Suspects," Simply Amazing
","This film should be 15 years by now but I recently watched it again yesterday evening on TV and the impact was still the same.Simply put, 'The Usual Suspect' is one of the most amazing films in cinematic history. Few films with such entertainment value that I can compare with TUS include the Shawshank Redempion, the Godfather(without the twist),Gladiator etc.This film is a classic which spawned a lot of mediocre 'twist' movies such as Basic, Hide & Seek, etc.From the opening scenes of the corpses on a burning boat to the last astonishing scene, the film grabs you and never lets you go.Bryon Singer has never directed such a better movie since and here, he did a masterful job. All the actors gave powerful performances but the outstanding ones were Chazz Palmenteri, Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Bryne. Of course, Bryne is one of the most intense and yet underrated actors who would have been my preferred choice as the amnesiac assassin in the Jason Bourne series.I heard Al Pacino turned down the role played by Chazz due to a scheduling conflict. A great loss but Chazz still held his own and gave a wonderful performance.But the person deserves the most credit is the screenplay writer, Christopher McQuarrie. How he could conceive such a simple and yet convoluted plot is beyond my comprehension. What inspired him? I recommend the film to suspense lovers. Its truly a classic.",9,1,2,19 January 2010
Insidious," Insidiously scary
","I sat down to watch this movie INSIDIOUS with mixed feelings. I love horror films nut recently Hollywood, has been churning out thrash in this genre with few notable exceptions like THE DESCENT. Even the much over hyped PARANORMAL ACTIVITY seemed to me to be a boring experiment in cinematography.Then a film like INSIDIOUS comes along to breath a fresh air into the genre and revitalized a story telling style of haunted homes that is reminiscent of the old horror movies.Its greatest strength perhaps is that it does not rely on gore, surprising considering that the director is James Wan who made his directorial mark in the hyper bloody and extremely gory SAW. Script writer Leigh Whannel creates a story about a family that moves into a cute old fashioned house to begin a new life. Soon, odd things, spectacles, noises, begin to occur which makes Renai Lambert, the matriarch start to suspect that the house is haunted. Suspicion becomes conviction after her son falls inexplicably into coma. Faced with baffled doctors and a semi-skeptical husband, she is forced to force the truth of the horror that her family is about to face. Anyone with even a passive interest in horror will see the clichés in INSIDIOUS. The afflicted child, the haunted house, the distraught mother (not the father), the hair rising music. We have seen them all in such movies like THE EXORCIST, THE UNBORN, HAUNTED, etc. But in INSIDIOUS, the clichés are refreshingly told with a simplicity and a style that makes you hooked right from the spooky credits (again reminiscent of old movies style) to the heart stopping conclusion. And unlike in other horror movies, halfway through the movie, the couple decides to do the most sensible thing a family will do in real life if confronted with an inexplicable evil in their own house instead of waiting till all the family members are killed.Both the director and the writer deserve a lot of credit for this outstanding horror piece. Rose Byrne was good as the distraught mother who would believe anything to save the son's life. So was Patrick Wilson who at first is hesitant in accepting a supernatural explanation for what was happening to their son. Their acting was not really outstanding but still good enough to support a low budget horror movie. (It had a reportedly budget of $1.5m and grossed over $50). Great scary movie.",8,0,1,10 January 2012
Gladiator," A Champion
","The Fall of The Roman Empire, a blockbuster Roman epic that nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox, sounded the death knell for major films about the Roman Empire for decades, until the genre was revived by Ridley's Scott masterpiece, Gladiator.Gladiator is centered during the last days of the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his military campaign against the barbarian hordes of Germania. The person leading the campaign is his greatest General, Maximus, an honourable soldier and faithful servant to Rome. After Maximus wages a successful battle against the Germans, the emperor who is dying, hands over succession of the Roman Empire to Maximus. Maximus is to hold the crown in trust until Rome becomes a republic.Of course, Aurelius's decision does not go well with his son Commodus and in a fit of rage or hyper emotional surge, he smothers his father. Maximmus suspecting foul play in the death of the emperor refuses to show fealty to Commodus.This singular act of rebellion attracts the death penalty on his head and the consequences present a Homer epic like tale of tragedy, love, courage, loyalty, incest, betrayal and vengeance.With the exception of The Insider and possibly A Beautiful Mind, I have never seen Russel Crowe deliver such a credible performance as he did as the vengeful tortured Roman General who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor. His performance was outstanding and his burly frame helped him. Unlike most actors who would produce finely sculpted muscles developed in gyms, Crowe's body was more realistic as a veteran soldier whose body is exercised in the battle fields.But even his performance was matched by Joachin Phoenix as the disturbed incestuous Commodus. Phoenix was a delight to watch and one of the most complex characters. Despite his hatred for Maximus, it was obvious he admired and envied the the General's courage and would have rather had him as a friend than as an enemy. There was also the subtle jealousy of the affection his father had for Maximus.Interestingly enough, Richard Harris who played Aurelius had the most moving lines in the movies. Harris, despite his fondness for the bottle, could be always be counted on to give a dependable acting and in his 15 minutes in Gladiator, it is easy to see why he will always remain as one of the greatest character actors ever. This was his last movie and it was a befitting tribute to him.Another actor whose this was the last movie was Oliver Reed who plays the slave owner, Proximo. He did not finish the move and his face was superimposed on another actor. Still, his performance was mesmerizing.Connie Nielsen plays Lucien, Commodus's sister who is compelled to join forces with Maximus to protect her son. Other actors Like Derek Jacobi and Djimon Housnou also gave strong supporting performances.From the opening battles on the plains of Germania to the final scenes of Maximus' stand against Commodus, Scott does not waste any second with cheap melodrama or boredom. Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer produced a haunting magnificent score that will echo in your minds after the movie has finished.Kudos has to be given to the Scott's eyes for details. The battles were fierce and captivating, the Collosus was intimidating, and the costumes were top notch. Of course, he took a lot of fictional license with the movie. Historically speaking, Aurelius was never murdered by his son, Commodus. He actually handed over succession to Commodus and died later. Commodus was never killed in the arena, although as unbelievable as it may sound, he actually as the Roman Emperor participated in gladiatorial contests in the arena. Although it can be argued, that his rivals may have been much less aggressive in their battles with him, fully aware of the repercussion of killing a Roman emperor, even in sport.SKG and Universal took a brave stance in forking out the money to bring out this dream masterpiece. Gladiator simply rocks!",Null,0,0,23 August 2011
