Minority Report," Very Disappointing
","Some time ago I bought this movie as a USA import and eagerly awaited its arrival. Having younger kids I don't get to the cinema much and so I jealously guard my DVD fix. The hype promised me an entertaining time; futuristic setting, action packed set pieces, intrigue, a courageous leading character etc and although the film delivers this it somehow just wasn't enough. The film lacked something, it seemed pedestrian, I found it hard to engage with those elements I normally find entertaining. I don't mind watching inner turmoil but the tortured soul of the leading man didn't offer the glimmer of a satisfactory outcome. It seemed as though he was substituting the visionary girl for his lost child but the script just couldn't pull it off. I didn't care about their time together, *minor spoiler* I wanted Tom's character to find his child or bring the perpetrator to justice offering him and the viewer some closure but alas no; I would have chosen a different sub plot to move the story along. I think the movie was over produced and didn't bring enough substance to the visuals. The message boards are full of guff about plot holes, the ability of the pre-cogs, the stereotypical Witwer character but this viewer is happy to suspend disbelief for entertainments sake if the overall effect is entertaining. Unfortunately the climax provided a predictable ending to the main plot area and that's a shame because I really wanted to enjoy this movie.",Null,3,5,5 November 2004
The 13th Warrior," Cracking yarn
","I found this troubled production to be hugely entertaining and it is one I enjoy watching time and again. The basic idea is that Ibin (Antonio Banderas) is a wealthy Arab. A well educated man whose elitist (he walks palatial halls) and scholarly (he describes himself as a poet) lifestyle comes to a steady halt due to him being exiled by the Caliph for being a little too 'friendly' with a married woman.Exiled far to the North with a small entourage including (Omar Sharif) he happens upon a camp of Vikings or 'Northmen' where he witnesses the ritual burial of a king and the rather swift and violent election of a new leader! A messenger arrives at the camp and 13 warriors are called for to travel back to their homeland to a kingdom besieged by beasts. As one of the warriors must not be a Northman Ibin is coerced to join this 'task force'.I enjoyed the visual poetry as well as the musical score, I found each to be very rich and whilst there wasn't much time spent on character development I found I could engage with and care for what was on offer.During the arduous journey (a lengthy passage of time condensed for movieland) Ibin passes the time by watching and listening to his compatriots; we see that these north men are a fairly robust but amiable bunch as they poke fun at each other and talk about their wifes and lives. As an educated fellow skilled in language and writing Ibin manages to communicate with his compatriots and at the end of the long, did I mention, long, journey he learns to speaka de lingo (so to speak).Upon arrival at the homeland the 13 warriors find that they are up against a bear worshipping tribe which they can only stop by killing the Witch / Mother and the tribal Leader. Whilst achieving their goal we are treated to a mixture of myth, legend, action, and adventure, all wrapped up in great cinematography and music.That said, the film undoubtedly has flaws, the unfinished plot line concerning the Kings son is unforgivable for a major studio and I echo those comments calling for a directors cut.Even with its flaws, it beats many other films hands down and is a welcome addition to the genre.",8,2,3,29 November 2005
The Village," Great Stuff
","This is a welcome change for me and as such it stands tall amongst other Hollywood offerings. As with his other movies there is a gimmick attached to the plot but I am glad M Night Shyamalan gave us a simple story with two fine performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard amongst a strong ensemble cast. People who view and review Shyamalans movies often concentrate on the gimmick 'I see dead people' Sixth Sense; 'an indestructible man' Unbreakable; 'alien beings' Signs; when I believe these elements come a close second to the characters and how they develop throughout the story. For me Unbreakable was about discovering love and meaning within your life (Bruce Willis gave up a sporting career for the love of his wife, a love which slipped away in the face of life's mundane disappointments) and in Signs it was about Mel Gibson letting go of the past to live for the future and reaffirming his faith. Children and family feature heavily in the two latter stories and their fathers, although loving, are lost within them selves and are unable to see the love and joy available within their family group. The story progresses and the plot gimmick, when realized allows the character to move towards their niche in the world. I found similar themes within the Village. For me it's essentially about faith and romance; faith in yourself and again the joy to be found in companionship and love.The movie starts slowly immersing the viewer in the village community; I found that this time was well used to develop character and setting and serves to allow the viewer full access to the characters thought process when making decisions later on.Some have said that you can figure out the ending, so what? At least it's done well; I rather liked the idea myself, although, I understand that it has been used before but then so has 'dead person finally realising they're dead' (Sixth Sense) and this was met with rave reviews across the world! Who cares if its been done before? This is a deftly handled piece of film-making; I reveled at the innocence of the characters and the beginnings of the romance between Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard. I found simple enjoyment in setting up their feelings for one another and then putting them to the test such as when she steadfastly believes he won't leave her in danger and the moment he finally holds her hand again. I think I enjoyed this romantic aspect because it was subtle but powerful. In many respects is difficult to place the movie in a genre; one reviewer was disappointed because they thought this movie was going to be a horror film; I found this incredibly difficult to believe given the amount of information on offer before it went on general release and can only assume that this particular reviewer doesn't get to watch many movies. I found the movie offered some eerie moments and some genuine excitement. While it may not tick all my boxes its miles better than many of its contemporaries and definitely worth a look.",Null,17,32,10 November 2004
Taken," It doesn't get much better.
","A no nonsense, kick the crap out of everyone who gets in your way action movie. Liam Neeson's character is the angry love child of Bourne,Bond and all the other pretenders put together. If I was asked to cast the movie I guess he wouldn't have been my first choice but having seen it I can't think of anyone else I'd rather have in the role. The fight choreography is bone crunchingly good. This is one kick ass flick and one I will definitely buy on DVD. There's little doubt who the bad guys are and they get a very satisfactory smack in the mouth - when they aren't being shot or electrocuted. This was made by people who like the genre and know how to get an action movie from A to Z. I can't help but giggle at those reviews that mention plot and probability in this kind of movie. What kind of movie did they think they were going to see?",9,251,331,9 January 2009
The Island," Logan 5 or Lincoln 6
","I really enjoyed this movie. I found shed loads of similarities between this and another favourite of mine, Logan's Run. The lottery on the Island reminded me of carousel from Logan's Run, the set interiors of the 'facility' had a very familiar feel to them, the costumes, although white, reminded me of the sandman outfits due to their cut and the last scene of the movie is almost identical! That said, the story is updated, the pace and excitement have gone up a few levels and Lincoln goes places Logan never did. America of the future looks great CGI wise and I found the action set pieces to be very exciting. The main car chase is the best I've seen in a long time. The acting and script kept me entertained and I cared about what happened to the lead characters. Like most people here I watch stacks of movies hoping each one will deliver the goods. This was just what I needed.",10,8,14,9 December 2005
