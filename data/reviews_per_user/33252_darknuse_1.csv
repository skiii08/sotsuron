Source Code," An OK movie. (Spoiler at the bottom.)
","Jake Gyllenhaal is a very competent actor, and he proves it once again in Source Code. I've been waiting a long time to see this movie, and maybe that's why, when I finally got to it, it wasn't as good as I expected. That being said, it wasn't bad.SC is an enjoyable, light-hearted 'mystery movie', but when they introduce quantum mechanics and string theory into the script they get in over their heads (unlike 'Primer' and similar films where it's an essential, well explained and theoretically possible plot). There were several times in the movie where I went 'what? But that's not possible at all!', to the point that I eventually had to try to disregard the manuscript flaws. But then again, I really enjoy movies where you have to be engaged all the time, and where the audience members gets to 'go the extra mile'.One of the biggest reasons for the low vote is the neurological perspective, in where *SPOILER* the main character gets to partake in eight minutes of another persons mind. Even so, the main character has access to information that the other person did not have, which unfortunately is an enormous plot hole! *SPOILER*",6,1,2,24 January 2016
