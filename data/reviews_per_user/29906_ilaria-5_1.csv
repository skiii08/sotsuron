Deja Vu," hilarious...and already seen
","I personally found the plot too complicated to the point in which you spend the following 15 min after the end of the film (after which you decide you have definitely something more useful to think of) summing up all the events to make some sense out of them. Surrelistic plot, to the extent that you cannot avoid smiling and think: This is really too much! Abundance of elements which have already been: the brave courageous and stubborn police-man, the stunningly beautiful and unlucky young woman, the crazy maniac threatening the American security, last...but not least...a love story! The classic and boring 'American action movie' full of stereotypes and the unavoidable happy end!",4,4,9,27 December 2006
