The Avengers," The MCU taking shape
","I'll keep this short. I really enjoyed this upon release at the cinema and did again 6 years later. 
Great Marvel movie bringing the preceding MCU movies all together as one.",9,1,2,31 July 2018
Iron Man 3," Weakest of the 3 iron man movies
","Definitely not the best Iron Man movie and one of the weakest MCU movies. 
The first 3/4 of the movie was ok but the final action sequence wasn't up to the usual Marvel standard. The Guy Pierce villain just didn't seem powerful enough. 
Could have been better. Overall a bit average.",6,0,1,2 August 2018
Iron Man 2," Disappointing sequel
","I watched this first time upon release and was disappointed. I hoped after a few years i would appreciate more but unfortunately not. 
It dragged at times and action not as good as other MCU movies. Introduced new characters but maybe should have concentrated on this movie rather than the ones to follow. I gave it a 6 but 5.5 would be more appropriate.",6,0,0,24 July 2018
The Day After Tomorrow," Watch again and again
","Decent action sequences, fun to watch, great disaster movie to watch again and again.",7,0,2,24 July 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," Ok but not the best MCU movie
","This movie does a good job of introducing Captain America, Bucky and Agent Parker and because of that the movie feels like a pilot for a series. 
It takes time to get going and the Red Skull is a weak bad guy. I know he is from Nazi Germsny but feels dated. 
There are plus points for this movie and is a solid 6/10 but I've learnt to expect more from the MCU.",6,1,1,23 July 2018
Fargo," Overrated but ok
","Finally got round to seeing this and I was rather disappointed.
It is slow paced and sometimes that's not a bad thing but it seems the reason in this case is that the movie wouldn't be long enough otherwise and still don't know why the scene with the infatuated Japanese man was in the movie! More padding?
It's not all bad though. It's a ok movie and there are good acting performances all round, funny dialogue and good on screen chemistry between the actors. Just a little overrated. Go in with lower expectations and you won't be as disappointed as I was.",6,1,3,26 July 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," My favourite MCU movie
","Recently just rewatched this and still love it.
The first scene with Chris Pratt with the great music where he collecting the orb sets the mood for the whole movie. Good tunes, action and with humour thrown in. 
I went in open minded as I am not a comic book fan so didn't know who the Guardians were and I was blown away. And rewatching helped me make sense of the MCU I had missed before. 
 Highly recommended.",9,0,2,3 August 2018
Thor," Just as good second time round
","I enjoyed this when it came out and was interested to see if it stood the test of the me and I'm glad to say it did.
If anything I appreciated the humour more which brings a different side to the character of Thor which would lad have been pretty one dimensional otherwise. 
Very underrated Marvel movie.",8,8,12,18 July 2018
Iron Man," Great start to the MCU
","I did not understand the significance of Iron Man when it was originally released. That it was the start of what became the MCU and all the movies that followed. Even so I rated it as a great film initially. 
Now after re-watching after all these years I can see how clever Marvel were starting with this movie and how everything follows. 
Great as a stand alone movie, even better if you watch all the Marvel movies that follow.",8,0,0,22 July 2018
Coach Carter," Better than average sports movie
","Ive seen lots of sports movies that are feelgood stories where a struggling athlete/team of no hopers succeed on the court and become better people and Coach Carter is the same. 
It isn't original but the story is told well. The backstories of the players are a bit flimsy but it's better for it and doesn't descend into the cheesiness of many movies of this type. 
Pleasantly surprised and my wife enjoyed it too so one for the men to choose on movie night.",7,0,0,15 July 2018
Draft Day," Only watch if you understand the draft
",This is a good movie for sports enthusiasts but bad for anyone who does not understand the NFL draft. I bit silly in places in how the resolution of the player picks comes around but worth watching.,7,0,1,20 November 2018
