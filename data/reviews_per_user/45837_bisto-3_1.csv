The Blair Witch Project," The scariest movie ever made!
","There will never be a scarier movie made than this one. I am still shaking in my boots. My advice is DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE and DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE!These guys took it to the limit. They took their time with it, slowly wrapping it around the audience until there was no escape. These images are long lasting and seductive: you keep needing to return to them to mull them over, even though you don't want to.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
