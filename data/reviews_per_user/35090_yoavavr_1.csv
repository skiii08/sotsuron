Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Great movie, but way too much Hebrew...
","I just saw it at a screening in the Haifa film festival, i have never laughed so much in my life. If you have already seen older Borat material then you are in for a real treat. Sacha really takes the Borat character to extremes here Just a couple of points of criticize: 1. Although 90% is as funny as hell. The background story is weak and i wish they could find a better story to connect the skits.2. When broad speaks Kazakh, he actually speaks Hebrew in a Kazakh accent (Sacha baron Cohen is half Israeli, and speaks fluent Hebrew), Which is very funny at first for the Israeli audience, but after a couple of times it gets annoying and repetitive. I wish he would just speak real gibberish. It's nice to share a private joke with Sacha but it really gets tiring after a while.3. The trailer gives away too many jokes, if you haven't seen the trailer yet, then just don't see it. You will enjoy the movie more.But in general, although the movie isn't perfect, it is still the funniest movie i have ever seen, so it defiantly deserves the best score. I am sure that this will be a true cult film for the ages. And i would defiantly go to the theater to watch it again once it comes out. 10/10.",9,5,25,13 October 2006
