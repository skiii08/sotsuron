Miracle," Almost as good as the real thing!
","For anyone alive during the US 1980 games they can certainly remember the excitement they experienced watching them.  When a group of kids gave us hope when there was none.  This movie captures the American spirit in or hearts today just as if we were living it for the first time.  I was so captivated, at times I believed I was actually watching Herb Brookes on the screen.  I found myself cheering with each unbelievable goal and clapping with the incredible goal tender saves.  I left the sneak preview anxiously awaiting the full release to go back and experience it all over again.  A must for any hockey fan and a great 2 hours of fun and enjoyment for everyone else.",10,0,0,1 February 2004
