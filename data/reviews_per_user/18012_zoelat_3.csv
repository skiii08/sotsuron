Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Running time?
","I have seen this movie today and was very pleased with it, having thought that 'Kill Bill Vol 1' was magnificent. Uma Thurman's performance is top-notch, as is that of David Carradine; I have never been more impressed by any previous performance by Michael Madsen as by the one he delivers here....well done!! It is intriguing to note that 'imdb' itself lists the running time as 136 minutes, while 'Rotten Tomatoes' gives it as 130 minutes; in New Zealand it is screening at 138 minutes, so perhaps our censor has passed some extra footage which was cut out in other countries. The NZ censor has been doing a good job over recent years.",Null,0,1,17 May 2004
Oldboy," Unexpected total involvement
","I have, only recently, become appreciative of Korean films (another fine one is 'Memories of Murder') and, when I saw a dvd available for 'Oldboy' and had read of its recent awards, I bought the SE set... The quirky beginning irritated me, but I soon got into the mood of the film and no holds were barred in my total attention to every frame of the movie. It is a masterpiece of directing and editing. Every frame either holds relevance to a previous point of the film or relevance to what will come later on. I was so impressed that I have also purchased the director's previous film, 'Sympathy for Mr Vengeance' and I look forward to watching that dvd soon.",10,11,85,1 August 2004
