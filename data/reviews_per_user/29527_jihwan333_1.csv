Your Name.," Incredible. Out of words...
","Before I begin, I made an IMDB account just to review this specific movie. Have you ever browsed a movie site trying to find the perfect movie for you with good graphics, cinematography/animation, sound and a plot that makes you think for days? This movie is it. This movie is filled with amazing animation that Makoto Shinkai put tons of effort on. It's truly an eye opener towards animation movies. The story plot in the beginning could sound confusing and eventually bore you out, but as the story unravels, it's out of the ordinary and interesting. Since the language is in Japanese and I watched it with an English subtitle, I watched it over 4 times to make sure I didn't miss any parts. All 4 times of me watching gave me goosebumps and amazed me. This is the first Japanese animation movie that I watched and was worth every single second of the movie. If you are considering, WATCH IT!",10,1,1,21 June 2018
