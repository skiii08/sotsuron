The Blair Witch Project," The scariest thing about this film was how badly the critics overrated it
","When Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez came up with the idea to create a mock documentary made solely to creep people out, they were definitely playing around with a good idea.  The movie could be made on an extremely tight budget.  The shaky camera work and poor film quality would actually do the film a service, by making it seem all the more genuine.  And, finally, the movie could rake in a fortune because, when you think about it, who doesn't like to hear a good ghost story, every so often?  Too bad this one doesn't chill you to the bone, like the directors had intended.The long, arduous filler scenes used between the scares also made Witch a less-than-perfect 'project.'  We have the 2 minute horror scene, during the night, then the 10 minute filler, during the day.  After 2 or 3 times, this cycle becomes an exercise in tedium.  Not to mention, despite what everyone is saying, the horror scenes weren't really that terrifying . . . with exception to one.It is this scene, the last 5 minutes of the film, where The Blair Witch Project succeeds amazingly well.  What is revealed during the last 5 minutes of Witch (don't worry, I'm not going to tell you what it is), will have the hairs on the back of your neck standing on end.  This isn't something you'll forget easily.  Once you've seen it, it's gonna be ingrained inside of your brain for a long time.  You could come down with Alzheimer's, be hit by a truck, fall off of a bridge, and be thrown into a coma, and you still wouldn't forget the finale of this film.  It's that creepy.   That horrifyingly memorable.  That intense.  It's what The Blair Witch Project, in its entirety, reached for, but never quite grasped.",4,11,20,24 June 2000
The Incredible Hulk," For the fanboys
","Rebooting a franchise that was unsuccessfully rebooted only 5 years prior seems to be an incredible risk, but The Incredible Hulk proves that Marvel knows their material better than Ang Lee. While Lee's Hulk was a more ambitious, creatively daring picture, it just wasn't the Hulk fans know from the comics. The Incredible Hulk, on the other hand, is as comic-book as a comic-book movie can get. That's not to say it's the best comic-book movie ever made (far from), but by the time it's over you'll be tempted to wipe quad-colored ink from your fingertips.This is a big, loud celebration of the green behemoth and all the toys that he loves to smash. The first action sequence featuring Hulk himself is one of the better staged action scenes of the summer -- if not the year. The hulking hero is introduced to us just right. He's an angry monster in the shadows. A glimpse of something moving in split second sprints caught only by your peripheral vision. His introduction had me thinking Hulk as a horror movie may be the best idea ever. But that would, once again, go against the Hulk fans know from the comics.This movie is nothing if not fan service. Stan Lee shows up (in more ways than one). Lou Ferrigno has a memorable moment. They even manage to work in a cameo for deceased actor Bill Bixby. If you're a die-hard fan of the comics and don't like this movie, you accidentally stumbled into Sex and the City.Marvel goes as far as to make the same mistakes as they do in the comics -- the climax is too hectic to be enthralling and the last 20 minutes are as busy setting up a sequel, a spin-off and a crossover as they are a decent finale to a once entertaining movie. Still, complaints aside, this is a fun movie for the fans and this review could have been just as easily summed up in 2 words: HULK SMASH!",6,5,9,17 June 2008
The Ring," Best horror movie ever?!?
","How much did they pay the studio plants to post messages like that?  If you read the earlier 'reviews' (IE - advertisements) posted for this film, you'll see one person after another saying how 'The Ring' is the 'scariest movie ever.'  Now that the REAL audience is seeing the picture, it's being revealed for what it is; a mediocre horror film (wait until video) filled with plot holes, bad directing, poor character development and interaction, and two million loose ends.  You feel like you're about to be rewarded for the two hours you spend, and end up with a predictable finale that leaves you with even more questions.  The film is lazy.  The writer and director had NO IDEA where the wanted to go with this.  And all of the 'scary' stuff is stuff you've seen a million times before in almost every other ghost movie ever made.  Very disappointing.  I hope the studios come around and realize that when they hype their movies so heavily through planted reviews, it only leaves the audience that much more disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, the film isn't horrible, but it isn't anything deeper than cheap terror flicks like 'Jason X' or 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,' and it makes less sense than either of those films.  There is no reason to see this film.  Why?  If you watch a lot of horror movies, you've seen it all before.",5,0,0,18 October 2002
Casablanca," Better than you can even imagine!
","For whatever reason I kept putting off watching this film.  I knew so much about it, including its ending, and for years meant to see it, but thought, 'what's the point?'  After watching it last night I remembered what made me a movie fan in the first place.  Movies like Casablanca.  I was astounded with how influential this picture was.  I knew Raiders of the Lost Ark was inspired by the old Saturday Afternoon Serials, but I had NO IDEA how much it had taken from 'Casablanca.'  The shots, the cinematography, the staging of characters, even the clothing.  So many movies were inspired by this film (some were direct rip-offs).  I may go as far as to say that this is the most influential film ever made (along with Citizen Kane)!  I absolutely loved it.  No matter what type of film you favor, you'll find something to like about this movie.  Don't make the same mistake I did and put it off for decades.  It's well worth a rental or even a purchase!",10,1,1,25 August 2002
Chicken Run," A family film in the truest sense of the word
","A family film in the truest sense of the word.  This is a movie the entire family will enjoy, not just the 5 and under set.  Winking its eye at cultural diversity, and the animosity that oftentimes goes along with it, was a clever move, and makes for some of the best jokes in the film.  The English covering up feelings of inferiority by denouncing the 'Yanks' and the 'Yanks'' cockiness (pardon the pun) and naivety of other cultures are both put on vivid display here, all for the sake of a few good laughs.  Then there's the romance, the sexuality (yes, sexuality - with chickens!) and the violence.  Throw in a good dash of action, an inspired scene straight out of Indiana Jones' 101, in particular, and you have the ingredients for one of the most entertaining animated movies in years.  An over-abundance of failed escape scenes drag the film down a bit.  Watching a few dozen chickens trying to escape from their 'prison' is only amusing so many times, before it starts seeming like filler-material.  This petty complaint aside, Nick Park, the claymation genius behind short-films such as 'Wallace & Gromit' and 'Creature Comforts', is off to a great start with his first full-length animated movie.",8,0,0,25 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," George Lucas, what were you thinking?
","If you go into Attack of the Clones thinking that it will be the Star Wars you've been waiting for ever since The Empire Strikes Back, you'll be sorely disappointed.  If you go into Attack of the Clones thinking it'll be a pretty fun flick, even if it doesn't manage to come close to the original Star Wars or The Empire Strikes Back, as is the case with Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace, you'll be sorely disappointed.  If you go into Attack of the Clones expecting much of anything, really, you'll be sorely disappointed.  George Lucas, what were you thinking?  I'm just going to go down a list of things that stood out to me (minor spoilers are given):1.  The romance.  Lucas must have had sap on the brain when writing this melodramatic excuse for a love affair.  This relationship should have been something special.  At the very least, it shouldn't have been embarrassing. This is honestly one of the most moronic things I've ever seen put on the screen.  The audience busted out laughing with EVERY SINGLE LINE that fell flatly from the lover's lips.  With lines such as, 'I don't like sand ... it's not soft and smooth like you' how could they not?2.  Hayden Christensen cannot act.  This Canadian pretty boy should have stuck with soap operas.  Hayden Christensen makes Jake Lloyd look like a Thespian.  Then again, he was good in Life as a House.  Maybe it's not his acting but the fact that ...3.  George Lucas can't direct actors.  This is Lucas's worst attempt, yet. I don't think he's even trying, anymore.4.  No one can act in the movie, with possible exception made for Ewan McGregor, who does a good imitation of Alec Guinness.5.  We've been here before.  It's always fun when Lucas throws a line or two in from past Star Wars films, but this movie is one big cut and paste. It's tedious, and Lucas has run out of ideas.  The, 'I've got a bad feeling about this' line is becoming similar to Bond's, 'shaken, not stirred.'  The audience just wonders when it's going to come, and when it does, it's obvious the only reason it came was to get it out of the way.6.  Why are all the Clone Troopers CGI?  What happened to people in costumes?  If I wanted to see a cartoon, I'd pay for one.7.  Jango Fett.  See 'Clone Trooper' comment above.8.  Some of the worst special effects ever.  Sure, Yoda looks simply incredible, as far as CGI goes, but what's up with the scene with Anakin riding that cow sort of things to impress Amidala?  Or how about C3PO flying around the factory?  These effects are inexcusable.9.  This didn't feel like Star Wars.  It felt like a movie ripping off Star Wars.  Something wasn't right.10.  I wonder if HE ever saw Close Encounters.  Those aliens Obi-Wan encounter look just a little *too* close to the long-necked aliens from Spielberg's classic.11.  This wasn't dark.  All you people saying this is dark, shut up.   It isn't.12.  The comedy.  Even worse than in The Phantom Menace.  Out of the dozens of attempted jokes only one or two really work.13.  Lack of war in the stars.  Where were the space battles?  What is this crap?  Wasn't this called Star Wars for a reason?14.  Why don't you spell it out for us, George?  The plot seems like it was written for 2 year olds.  Nothing is subtle.  Every so often Anakin gets a nasty look on his face and breathes heavily as Darth Vader's theme begins playing.  I was waiting for a scrolling message to appear on the bottom of the screen letting us all know that, 'the person above will turn into Darth Vader.  Please notice foreboding music and nasty facial expressions. Aren't we clever?'15.  No fun.  Outside of a couple scenes, the movie just wasn't fun, and the frenetic energy of past Star Wars films is no where to be found.16.  Lightsaber battle with non-CGI characters was worst saber battle in any Star Wars film.  It's all a bunch of close-ups with everyone pretty much standing stationary.  Where's Darth Maul when you need him?  I love Christopher Lee, but this old guy doesn't cut it when it comes to an awesome Lightsaber duel.17.  Why was that guy who used to be on NYPD Blue in there?  His role was pointless.  Give it to somebody whose face we don't recognize, if you have to put in such a pointless part in the first place.  Watching NYPD Man was distracting.18.  Pointless cameos from characters in past movies.  It didn't work this time.  Very obvious and irritating.19.  Amidala was a wimp.  This lady can't be the mother of Princess Leia. Lucas reduced Amidala down to a sniffling little tramp with nothing much to do, other than make puppy dog eyes and play the victim.20.  Exposition.  We get at least an hour of it.  It's delivered without an ounce of panache.  It's dull, lifeless, monotone.  Everyone is acting in front of a blue screen, and it shows21.  Too long.  This movie DRAGS.  It could have been at least 20 minutes shorter.  So many useless moments and characters.  With all that high-tech stuff over at Lucasfilm, it's amazing they still haven't picked up an editing machine.22.  Yoda rules.  I loved it.  It's worth a trip to the Box Office once just to see Yoda get nasty.I didn't hate this movie.  It just happens to be the first Star Wars movie I didn't love.  I didn't even like it, actually.",9,0,0,16 May 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Revolutions turns into your standard Hollywood action movie - big on explosions, small on brains.
","Andy and Larry Wachowski have written and directed themselves into a hole. The original Matrix was an intelligent and refreshing science-fiction film. The Matrix Reloaded was a rehash that pretended to be intelligent by spewing out a bunch of fortune cookie philosophies and a series of unanswerable questions meant to keep the diehards believing that this moneymaking venture was leading to something meaningful.  The Matrix Revolutions drops all pretenses and turns into your standard Hollywood action movie - big on explosions, small on brains.An advantage Revolutions has over Reloaded is with its characters. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), in particular.  For some unknown reason, Morpheus became this sort of Jesse Jackson meets Yoda type character in the second film.  He was boring and pretentious.  It looked as though his face would crack if he even attempted to smile.  In the third film, with his faith in The One shaken, he's a far more human character.  By the end, he becomes almost likable.  At the same time, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has become even more egocentric and out of control.  He makes for a wonderful bad guy, and Weaving does an excellent job of upping-the-ante in the third film, to give the audience the feeling that Smith is a real threat that needs to be stomped out, at all costs.  His performance adds a level of tension to the film that it almost doesn't deserve.  It also makes the final confrontation between Smith and Neo, this one labeled the 'Super Burly Brawl,' far more exciting than the Burly Brawl in Reloaded.  Sadly, it can't save the battle between Christ (Neo) and the Anti-Christ (Agent Smith) from an unsatisfying ending.The ability to avoid looking for the answers is the only way you'll be able to enjoy this film.  If you turn your brain off for The Matrix Revolutions in the same way you would for Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle, you'll have an okay time.  But the Matrix trilogy was supposed to be the exception to the big-budget rule.  Instead of turning your mind off, these movies were meant to make you think.  If the questions asked in Reloaded were actually answered in Revolutions, this could have been an incredible film.  Sadly, newsgroup predictions of what would happen in The Matrix Reloaded, typed out by hardcore fans of the series, have been more interesting than what the Wachowski brothers eventually came up with.",4,0,0,5 November 2003
American Beauty," Poignant, amazing, timeless
","American Beauty is a dark comedy with beautiful streaks of light shining through the celluloid.   Terrifying moments become uplifting in the blink of an eye.  And there's so much to see in this movie that, with every blink, you'll miss something amazing.   Something poignant.  Something timeless. 
The cinematography by Conrad L. Hall combined with the directing style of first-time director, Sam Mendes, rivals the best of directing greats Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, and Atom Egoyan.   The film visually envelops the audience in a way few have.  There are images that will be with you forever.  Some are subtle; some are startling.  All are unforgettable.",10,0,0,24 June 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," Unwelcoming Cliffnote to something far more profound
","This movie starts and ends in the same place - nowhere.  Who are these people?  Why should I care about them?  Outside of a few flashbacks Winona Ryder (playing Susanna) has (which are all conveniently forgotten about within 20 minutes of the film), we get no background on anyone.  It's as if we're expected to believe each of these nuts were delivered by a stork, without reason, to the mental ward, never to be released again.  What drove these people to such a desolate place?  What drove James Mangold to write and direct such a meandering film?  I must confess that I have not read the novel, upon which this movie is based, and I'm guessing a lot of the questions I, and everyone I have talked to about the movie 'Girl, Interrupted', have asked are answered between its pages.  Still, not one of us were advised that this movie was merely a companion piece to some depressed rich kid's desolate fantasy.  I feel this movie is a bleak, unwelcoming Cliffnote to something far more profound.  I'm generally an avid reader, and I will most likely give in and buy the novel, but, without it, I wouldn't pay to see this film if somebody paid me to do so . . . take that to your therapy session, and smoke it.",4,5,9,23 June 2000
Toy Story 2," None of the heart the original
","Fairly entertaining, but doesn't approach the original's greatness.  It has more style, better animation, an adequate storyline, but none of the heart the first installment contained.  Rent the movie, but watch part one again, beforehand, so your forgetfulness doesn't cause you to say something foolish like, 'I even liked that better than the first one!'",8,0,1,23 June 2000
The Hurricane," The movie starts feeling like an advertisement for something much better
","Due to a script which tries far too hard to show how 'naughty' the bad guys are, and how noble the good ones can be, 'The Hurricane' is a film that never quite lives up to its potential.  These characters are far too one-dimensional to be believable.  The sinister villain of the film, a corrupt law enforcement official played by Dan Hedaya, is so abominable, I kept expecting a couple of horns to pop out of his skull, as he tilted his head back to let out a contemptible laugh.  At the same time, Lesra Martin, and his group of Canadian merry men, are so virtuous, so totally pure, I wondered when woodland creatures would lovingly surround them, causing them to break into song.  The only character in the film who seems to have any genuine moral conflict is Denzel Washington's Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter. It's a pity the screenwriter (Sam Chaiton) took such a black and white approach with his character depictions, because, without this misstep, 'The Hurricane' would have had everything going for it. The cast of The Hurricane is superb.  The directing, by Norman Jewison ('Agnes of God', 'Moonstruck'), keeps the two hour plus movie moving at a fast pace, and doesn't give us time to get bored.  When it isn't annoying you with its simplistic character depictions, even the screenplay can be remarkably compelling.   I will recommend this movie, but with far less enthusiasm than I would have, if it had taken the time to make the true story it was based on seem a little more real.  I cannot overlook the broad stokes 'The Hurricane' ends up painting its characters with.  The movie almost starts feeling like an advertisement for something much better . . . possibly the two books that it was based on.",6,0,2,24 June 2000
The Green Mile," This is one mile worth walking
","There's only one thing wrong with 'The Green Mile' . . . its Oscar-baiting. All the thunderous music, slow-motion camera work and exploding lights get a little tiresome.  Taken as a whole, this a pretty petty complaint when put up against all that is good in this film.  It's a testament to how mesmerizing the movie is when the main character states, nearly 3 hours into the film, 'sometimes the Green Mile can seem so long,' and no one in the audience even lets out a snicker.  This movie moves so fast, I actually wish they would have taken another 30 minutes to include a portion of the novel they omitted (it was one of my favorite subplots).  When you find yourself thinking three hours wasn't quite long enough, you know you've got something great on your hands.  This is one mile worth walking.",6,0,0,23 June 2000
