Love and Death," Very Funny Film
","This is one of my favorite Woody Allen films. I thought it was just hilarious. In addition to good, humorous dialogue, there was some great physical comedy. I thought the whole bit about the tiny piece of land the father owned was hilarious. I liked the way the movie mocked philosophy too. There were just a lot of great moments. This was a very enjoyable movie.",Null,0,0,15 May 2002
