Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," borat, you are my hero. funniest movie i have ever seen.
","I saw Borat at the first ever screening, and I got to tell you, I have never seen a movie like this before. There was not a time of 30 seconds where i wasn't laughing. Animal House, Airplane!, Blazing Saddles, The Graduate, Wedding Crashers, The 40 Year Old Virgin, these movies cant compete with this movie. Every year, I see a movie each week, and this is so far the best film I have seen in 2006. Thank you Sacha Baron Cohen for turning these TV character into one of the most beloved movie characters in the history of films. I watch the D Ali G show all the time, and this movie really satisfied me. Please, evreryone see this movie.",10,3,15,9 November 2006
