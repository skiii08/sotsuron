Skyfall," The worst of them all
","Bond is really dead and Daniel Craig killed him off. This is not even a Bond-movie. All is gone that made Bond. The thrill, the romance, the humour, the good music, the incredible villains. This is just a bore. Bond looks like a English football huligan. No style, no charisma. Barbara Broccoli really managed to kill Bond off for good. Bond died when Daniel Craig took over. Then it went from fantastic adventures to just boring disaster. Even a trained monkey would be a better Bond than this. Daniel Craig really sucks. If you are a Bond-fan, avoid this mess. I saw this film once and that was enough - never more. What a torture. One had hoped that it would be the end of Bond but he came back in another total disaster, Spectre. Please - kill Bond once for all and let him out of his misery. RIP 007",1,3,9,23 June 2019
