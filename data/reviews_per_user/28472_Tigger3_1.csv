Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst movie ever, almost!
","After the long, long wait after ROTJ, we get this? The Phantom Menace had to be the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. Maybe I'm just to old for these movies, but I just rewatched A New Hope (SW 4) today and it still kicks @ss. PM dropped the ball big time and unfortunatly never picked it up, even AOTC was bad, but this was horrible. Much like Godfather 3 almost ruined the Godfather trilogy (my all time favorite trilogy), The Phantom Menace almost ruined the Star Wars franchise. I was expecting a lot out this move, maybe to much, but even the story was bad. The only two redeeming factors are Natalie Portman and the Pod Races, Natalie brought style and grace to the Queen. The pod races were just plain cool and enjoyable, but the worst part of the movie, Jar-Jar. What the hell is the point of him, he's more annoying then Tom Green. Out of 10 I gave the PM 3/10, and I hated to do it, but I hope Mr. George Lucas does a better job with the third film, hopefully more like ESB was, the best of the franchise.",3,0,1,9 July 2003
