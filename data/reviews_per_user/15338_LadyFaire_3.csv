The New World," Sadly inadequate
","I had high hopes for this film, and unfortunately I was very disappointed.While the visuals are stunning and the actors are well cast for the most part, this film is at least 45 minutes too long (too many shots of trees and grass) and is excruciatingly inaccurate historically. While a 'relationship' between Pocahontas and John Smith makes for an touching myth, for a big budget film to perpetuate this fairy tale is unfortunate to say the least. One would have hoped that Terrace Malick would have done a little bit of research before writing the script. Colin Farrell and Christian Bale make for yummy eye-candy, but it's not worth $8.00. If you MUST see it, wait for the video.",6,0,7,29 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," George Lucas Strikes Back
","For true Star Wars fans, the magic is back!  Lucas has once again struck gold with Attack of the Clones.I must admit, I've been a fan since I sat in the theater and watched the original Star Wars in 1977.  And, I liked 'The Phantom Menace'.  That said, 'Clones' is much better.  Ewan McGregor is fantastic as Obi-Wan, and Hayden Christensen's intensity as the now adult Anakin is stunning. Even though we know how the story ends, we are drawn into the details of a crumbling republic.  The secondary characters are interesting and well played, and we get some history on Boba Fett and the Lars connection.  On top of all that, we get Christopher Lee as Count Dooku.  That bit of casting was brilliant!'Clones' delivers exactly what we expect from a Star Wars film; absolutely stunning visual effects, fantastic cast, great story, and more fun than should be legal in 2 hours. Mr. Lucas has the unenviable task of writing not one but three prequels.  We KNOW what happens to these characters, but he keeps us interested to the point of hoping that the outcome will change; maybe Padme can keep Anakin from turning to the Dark Side, maybe the Republic can be saved.I can't wait for the DVD, so I can grab my popcorn and enjoy this film again at home until 2005, when the last installment arrives and the saga is complete.",10,9,13,2 November 2002
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Best Sequel So Far
","I just spent the day watching all of the Indiana Jones movies, and I fell in love with this one all over again.Last Crusade is the true sequel to the original Raiders.  The action sequences are great, and the fact that Indy is searching for an actual artifact, rather than some rock give Last Crusade a connection to Raiders that Temple of Doom didn't have.  Then there are the bonuses...Sallah and Marcus Brody are back, there is no annoying Short-Round, and (proof that there is a God!!!) no whining Kate Capshaw.  It has a much better plot and the absolutely brilliant casting of Sean Connery as Henry Jones make this film truly priceless.  Julian Glover is an acceptable 'bad guy' and the ending makes you think while you are being entertained.
This is a great movie, either alone or in combination with Raiders.  A must see for anyone who likes action/adventure!!!",9,1,2,2 December 2002
