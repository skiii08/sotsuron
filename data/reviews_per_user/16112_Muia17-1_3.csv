The Incredible Hulk," Incredible Hulk.....Pretty Much Incredible
","I just saw the Incredible Hulk yesterday and I was more then pleased. Not to hate on Ang Lee's version but it just wasn't as good in a lot of aspects. The CGI was waaaay better and the fight scenes were nasty. Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was mad good, Tim Roth was also really good playing the villain, and William Hurt did a good job playing the general. When Bruce's blood drips onto sterns I'm not sure what happens he starts to mutate, hes prolly going to be a villain in future films.I like how marvel is incorporating their movies together like with the tony stark cameo and the nick fury one in iron man, i didn't see the captain America clue which i was a little disappointed about. SO overall did they reboot the franchise I think without a doubt yes.",10,1,5,14 June 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," A Very Good Movie....However
","I have seen this movie and think it is very good, Tim Robbins is really good in it and Morgan Freeman as usual is great. It has a lot of original ideas and is deserving of much praise, however i really feel it lacks something that The Godfathers 1 and 2 have. They are just a different caliber of movie no offense to it, its very good. However Al Pacino in both of those films is as close to perfect of a performance as you will ever get. I really feel because it is 35 years old so many people of todays generation has not seen it, I am 20 and own all three and can appreciate the talent by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the first film and Al in the second with Francis Ford Coppola directing both. I understand that when someone sees a movie and they would like to rate it on this site its difficult to see all the other movies on the top 250, but when you are dealing with the top 5 its not that hard, see those movies and then judge.",1,18,106,29 July 2008
The Godfather," The Greatest Film Ever Made with 2 of the best actors ever in it.....
","The Godfather, there is so much to say about this movie, I mean it is incredible from beginning to end, taking you along as the main character, makes a change from a passive man to someone who has to step up and choose to do things against his nature for the good of his family. Marlon Brando is amazing in this movie as the Don, the head of the family, AL Pacino who takes over the movie deserved and Oscar for this movie not just a nomination, with a supporting cast that is phenomenal, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall etc.. The amazing part of this movie is after Marlon Brando's is almost killed and Michael makes the decision to take out Sollozo and and the captain for what tried to do to his father, after that scene Michael is never the same he realizes what he has to become and has to do to take care of his family. This movie deserves to be #1 on this site and everywhere, this is just my opinion.",10,1,3,29 July 2008
