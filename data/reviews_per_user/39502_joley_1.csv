The Blair Witch Project," what ever you do don't waste your money!!
","I had high expectations for this film. I was expecting to be shocked, scared and hanging on the edge of my seat instead I felt outraged. This film was supposed to be 'the scariest film ever made' and what it was is undescribable.  All I can say about the film is that if you want to spend an hour and a half of your life looking at trees, lakes and up peoples noses then go ahead but if your sane then trust me your better off staying at home!",1,2,3,10 November 1999
