The Blair Witch Project," Not worth watching
","I wished I had read comments here before watching it.  I vaguely recalled critics' praise and good ratings.Shot with a shaking hand-held camera, often in irritating narrow focus, the movie gets on your nerves in its first half with the unceasing chatter or crying of the female character (I don't think it was a problem only in the dubbed German version) and the second part gets creepy playing with the natural fear being lost in the woods especially at nights.",2,0,1,1 July 2000
Pi," uncompleted storyline, confused
",I would have expected much more from an independent film...  Good music and camera work can't make up for undeveloped story in this angst-film about a still obscure remaining obsession with numbers and patterns.  Don't expect any science fiction or anything more about the numbers because simply there isn't any.,5,0,1,13 June 2000
