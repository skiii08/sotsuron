Hereditary," Nope, save your money-trailer is lying
","Coming from someone who actually LIKED the Witch, this movie is a total letdown. I legitimately walked out of this film after over an hour, which is something I've never done before in my life. The acting is bad, none of the characters act like people, the writing is bad, the cinematography takes away from any atmosphere or tension, and the pacing is some of the worst I've ever seen. It's not scary. It's not even fake scary (jump scares). Anything done in this movie has been done a million times better in good horror films, like the Conjuring or in the Witch.I was scratching my head and rolling my eyes after every scene and the trailers are straight up lying to you.It doesn't even work as a dark drama.It's a Lifetime Original Movie with a budget and a decapitation scene. Save your time. Go watch better films.",1,13,28,9 June 2018
