Mission: Impossible III," Not Bad, But Little More Than An Extended Episode Of Alias
","From the patented opening scene that drops us in the middle of the action, then goes back in time and leads us in, this really isn't much more than an extended version of a typical episode of _Alias_. Except this time, Abrams and his crew can actually afford to go to the exotic places where the story is set, rather than trying to find stand-ins in LA and its environs. That said, this really wasn't a bad movie. It was enjoyable from start to finish, but not something you'll spend much time thinking about after it's over. I'm really surprised that none of the MI movies has really been a rousing action picture so far, so saying that this is the best of the three isn't saying that much, unfortunately. Still, as action pics go, you could do much worse and the film has really done a good job of kicking off the summer 2006 film season, which largely seems to be what it was designed to do.",8,0,1,8 May 2006
The Big Lebowski," This film is truly an under-rated gem! A classic!
","As I look over the other comments for the Coen Brothers' film, _The Big Lebowski_, I see that I am not alone in my appreciation.  When I first saw this film in the theater, it was a bit of a let-down, coming on the heels of the brilliant _Fargo_ (one of the greatest American films of the last 20 years, and that's no understatement).  But when I first rented it on home video, I was sucked in by the charm and the atmosphere of the film. 
It has such a laid-back, easygoing style that I can see how it might not appeal to those looking for nonstop action.  But if you're willing to surrender to the peculiar charms of this film, you too might begin to see it for the work of genius it is.  I've since purchased the film on video and have watched it several more times--it really is a film that grows on you and it is hilarious to boot.  John Goodman has never been better than in the role of the insufferable Walter, who knows everything and will never admit he's wrong, even when he clearly is.  But he's a true friend to the Dude, played by Jeff Bridges, and Donny, played by Steve Buscemi.  The three of them are bowling buddies, and in the course of preparing for the big tournament, they get pulled into a weird little mixup involving a carpet, a wayward wife, and the Big Lebowski, who just happens to have the same name as Bridge's character.I've seen this described elsewhere as a sort of anti-mystery and that's one way of enjoying it.  Imagine Jeff Bridges as a sort of stoned, clueless Philip Marlowe, stumbling through his investigation.  The comedy though is just so relaxed and unforced, unlike that in the Coens' _Raising Arizona_, a film I've never been able to watch.  The acting in this film is amazing, with a cast of independent film allstars.  The more I think about it, the more I wonder if this film might not be just that much better than _Fargo_.  If not, it's a very close second.  If you rent the film and it doesn't appeal to you at first, give it a chance--you might find that it grows on you, too.",10,0,0,8 August 2000
Unbreakable," Very Disappointing!
","I don't know what it was I was expecting.  I don't think I went in expecting _The Sixth Sense_ part 2.  But whatever it was, it certainly wasn't this. What a let-down this movie was!  What a ludicrous ending!  It was a slow-moving and very engrossing film to that point, but what a ridiculous conclusion.  I was hugely disappointed in the film and cannot in good conscience recommend it.  If Shyamalan had released this film before _The Sixth Sense_ I wonder if we'd all be talking about him now?",Null,0,0,26 November 2000
Dawn of the Dead," Amazingly good movie
","I went to both _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ and _Dawn of the Dead_ yesterday, and while I was expecting the former to be a great movie, I really didn't know what to expect from the latter. Surprisingly, of the two, the one that sticks in my mind is _Dawn of the Dead_. As others have noted, this really is a superior remake, in many ways better than the original--better acting, better effects, etc. Now I know the original is a classic, but this remake was just outright horrifying from beginning to end. It is doom-laden and edge-of-your-seat scary. I haven't had so much fun at a movie in a long, long time and when it was done, I wanted to see it again right away. Sarah Polley and Jake Webber are great and Ving Rhames lends able support. Mekhi Phifer is good as the young father slowly losing his mind in the aftermath of the breakdown of society. The movie is gruesome and very convincing in depicting an absolute breakdown--the first 30 minutes or so are just unrelenting in setting the scene and getting the audience in the mood--cars run over pedestrians, houses are on fire, you can't really tell who's friendly or who's a foe. I'll admit I didn't expect a whole lot from this movie, but it was just out and out fantastic! Highly recommended, if you've got the stomach for it.",8,0,0,22 March 2004
Constantine," Not bad, but why completely re-write the back-story?
","Constantine wasn't a horrible movie, though it does blatantly rip-off the series of Prophecy movies with Christopher Walken (as others have noted here). What I don't understand is the complete trashing of the comic character's back-story. John Constantine is British, for crying out loud! Obviously, some bright studio exec got ahold of this and said 'Couldn't we write this as a vehicle for Keanu Reeves?' and true to all the Hollywood clich√©s, the end result bears only a tiny resemblance to its source. The John Constantine from the Hellblazer comics would make for a much more interesting movie character than Keanu's occult detective/fix-it-man. The real John Constantine is much more of a bastard, perhaps the most selfish character to ever carry a series. And he's pretty much an expert on all things arcane--wouldn't need a weapons man holed up in the pin-setting works of a bowling alley to act as a low-rent Q. All this aside, I didn't completely hate the movie, but it certainly wasn't the revelatory breakthrough that some critics have branded it. There are some undeniably impressive visuals, but the story is weak and confusing and, ultimately, not very original (rent The Prophecy to see what I mean).",6,0,17,24 February 2005
28 Weeks Later," Not as good as the original, but not as bad as some of these posts would have you believe.
","I love movies like this--downbeat, end-of-the-world, apocalyptic, hopeless films. And _28 Weeks Later_ is pessimistic in spades. It is also one of the bloodiest films I've seen in some time. Sure, it's hard to follow up a blazingly original movie with an effective sequel (_Aliens_ is one of the few successes), but this movie is a lot better than the haters would have you believe. I've read reviews that take the film to task for its alleged plot holes. For example, the ease with which the two kids escape the quarantine zone and head for home. Does no one recall the American sniper who sees them leave, reports it in, and the helicopter and bio-suited soldiers waiting for them when they step out of their house? Or the lax security measures surrounding the mother, a carrier of the disease but not affected by it? The American head of medical quarantine has only just confirmed that the woman is indeed infected, causing the general in charge to set off for the woman's room with the intention of killing her. All of this is happening at the same time that Robert Carlyle, the guilty father/husband is sneaking in to see his wife. Granted, he probably shouldn't have an all-access pass that allows him in, but the point is, they haven't at this point confirmed that she's infected yet. So the lack of security measures is not necessarily a fault. Once the infection takes hold and begins to spread, the movie becomes a roller-coaster ride that never lets up. My only gripe was when the helicopter starts shooting at the car as it drives down London streets--if a car is moving, that means someone is alive in there and that someone is normal and uninfected. So why shoot? The 'shoot everything' directive makes sense at first in the big crowd, where the soldiers can't tell who is and is not infected. But after that, it doesn't make a lot of sense (which also leads to the completely unnecessary death by fire of Jeremey Renner's character). As with the first movie, I loved the scenes of a silent, empty London. Do you have any idea how difficult it was to shoot those? London is one of the world's busiest and most populous metropolises, so it's amazing to have those shots of silent, empty streets. I liked the ending, too. Hopefully, there will be a third movie in this series that will extend the story. Now that the infection has escaped the relative isolation of the UK, the potential for true terror has just been realized.",9,0,2,15 May 2007
Spider-Man," An Excellent Beginning to What Will Hopefully be a Long-Running Series!
","_Spider Man_ was great--everything I hoped it would be and more.  I was worried, especially after reading reviews in Time magazine and Roger Ebert's review of the film.  Neither was on-target.  This was a very good movie, easily on a par with the original Batman and, perhaps, even better than the first X-Men film.  Tobey Maguire was the perfect choice for Spider Man and the rest of the cast is equally-well chosen, particularly Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin.  The movie has a sense of fun and excitement to it that were infectious.  Sure, the 'origin' story may not have been the most exciting plot, but someone's got to do it and Sam Raimi was a great choice.  He's really matured as a filmmaker with _A Simple Plan_ and _The Gift_, but don't forget, this is also the director who gave us _Darkman_, essentially a superhero story.  Having grown up with the comics, I could not have wished for more--Stan Lee must be proud to finally see his vision on screen.  The only possible downside to the film is the 2-3 year wait for the next installment.  Glad to see Raimi's been nailed down as director for part 2.",Null,0,0,6 May 2002
Tigerland," Hard to believe this was directed by Joel Schumacher!
","I'm still scratching my head over the fact that this great, great movie was somehow directed by the same man responsible for the travesty that was _Batman and Robin_.  In fact, his entire career to this point has been rather lackluster.  But _Tigerland_ is, simply put, a revelation.  It is a film in the 'men go through bootcamp' vein, but it is more than that.  There are more than a few similarities to Stanley Kubrick's _Full Metal Jacket_, but the film stays with the bootcamp experience and doesn't follow its characters to actual combat in Vietnam.  Basically, we follow the story arc of a reluctant leader, Bozz (played by Colin Farrell), as he goes from platoon screw-up to respected leader.  Bozz is doing what he can to hold onto his sanity in the face of a system designed to turn him into a remorseless killer.  Farrell is the standout in what is a largely unknown cast, but all the actors do solid work here and this is the sort of film where, I predict, we'll be seeing more of these actors in the years to come, the kind of film that introduces a solid new group of unknowns who go on to make names for themselves.  _Tigerland_ is a great film and one which will appeal to a wide range of audiences.",Null,0,0,25 July 2001
City of God," Finally, Roger Ebert gets one right
","What an incredible film! Recently, when Roger Ebert was praising this to the high heavens, I had to wonder--lately he seems to be awfully full of gushing hyperbole (_The Hunted_ was 'a pure and inspire chase film'--did he see the same crapfest I wasted my money on?). But _City of God_ is actually worthy of the acclaim. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and it does very well what you want the best films to do--take you someplace you've never been before, someplace you couldn't go even if you wanted to. Sure, it is a violent film, but no more violent than something like _Gangs of New York_, and the violence here is all to a purpose--showing what happens to gang kids who grow up without any chance, without any guidance. The film is closer to something like _Goodfellas_ anyway, in showing the rise and fall of a gangster, and showing the development of a gangster culture, from the 60s into the 70s, as the relatively innocent marijuana business gives way to the more profitable and violent cocaine trade. The film is almost Dickensian in showing how a place affects the people who live there, and while it calls for change, it never does so in a preachy way. This is just an amazing, vivid, astonishing experience and you owe it to yourself to see this film in a theater if you can, on video otherwise.",10,0,2,21 April 2003
The Incredibles," Excellent Movie, Not Just For Kids
","I can't believe a movie this good would rack up so many negative comments. I took my 8-year-old nephew and 7-year-old niece, knowing they both really wanted to see it, but dreading a 'kiddie' flick. What a wonderful surprise! As others have said, this is easily one of the best movies, period, that I've seen all year, not just the best animated film. The story and the writing really appeal to an adult sensibility, especially a well-read comic geek such as myself, while the action sequences are plentiful and appeal to the younger crowd. If anything, there may be a bit too much of the family/work life scenes for younger kids--the movie is rather slow for long stretches. But I don't count that as a negative. The insights and the message which comes through is amazingly subversive--beware of a world in which there is nothing special, where mediocrity is celebrated. You don't expect that from a Disney film. The whole domestic take on superheroes and their secret identities could have come direct from an issue of Brian Michael Bendis' Powers or Alias, though not taken to those extremes. More importantly, not only did I have a great time at the film, my niece and nephew did, too. We're all looking forward to the sequel.",10,1,2,20 December 2004
Mulholland Drive," An Infuriating Film
","For the first two-thirds or so, _Mulholland Drive_ is a great film, an enthralling experience.  Despite the presence of several loose ends and characters who are never revisited, the story is riveting and drags you along for the ride, almost against your will.  Then, the whole, flimsy house of cards collapses and we're treated to an absolutely incomprehensible conclusion in which people switch identities, etc., etc. 
In _Lost Highway_, this switch actually made some sort of sense, but here, it seems like nothing so much as a sudden realization on David Lynch's part that he must come up with some sort of conclusion, some way to wrap things up.  If this wasn't a Lynch film, critics would be absolutely merciless in tearing it to shreds.  But because the great David Lynch is the director, everyone assumes there must be some method to the madness. 
At the screening I attended, an old man in front of me said, rather loudly, as the credits rolled, 'What the hell was that?' and the whole theater erupted in wild laughter.  He was verbalizing the reaction of many of us. 
Now, I'm a David Lynch fan through and through and will always be front and center at the release of each of his films, but this was a very disappointing experience.  It's too bad this wasn't picked up as a television series--there are moments of brilliance on display here and you can see where an extended series might have gone.  But _Mulholland Drive_ just doesn't work as a movie.",9,1,1,5 December 2001
Saw II," Really not that bad.....
","Saw II was sooooooo much better than the original Saw. I don't know what happened to Danny Glover and Cary Elwes on the original--their acting was just terrible. The one thing that movie had going for it was the final shock moment. The sequel on the other hand, is a fully-developed movie, with characterization and some good acting, from the likes of Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, and Glenn Plummer. Even Franky G, the loathsome drug dealer Xavier, turns in a pretty good performance. It is a gruesome movie, but I don't think it's a sick film, the way some critics have gone overboard in describing this as something fit only for borderline psychopaths. It's got a neat puzzle of a plot and it is all very logical and holds together quite well (that's another criticism I've read that has me scratching my head, that the film makes all sort of logical leaps, etc.). There's a reason for everything that happens and several neat twists and turns to the plot that we don't foresee. As in the first film, just when we think we know where things are going, we're suddenly clued into the fact that we have no idea where it's all going. If we could all just slow down and listen carefully to each other, and work together for the good of everyone, maybe these bad things could be avoided! On a side note, I was pleasantly surprised to see the theater ushers come in and make a group of 10 or 12 young kids leave the movie--it definitely isn't appropriate for them.",8,0,1,31 October 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Disappointing, but how could it be otherwise?
","I mean, these books are so crammed full of character and incident, how can they possibly be adapted to a two or two and a half hour film? I think the screenwriters did a better job with the last film--I never felt lost or saw gaping plot holes. This time, there's so much stuff that needs to be introduced and new characters to take the stage, that it just feels rushed and incomplete somehow. The whole first hour or so is primarily exposition and is so sketchy that those who aren't intimately familiar with the books might be lost. The movie takes too long to get going and when it finally does warm up and get exciting, blink, and it's over. I'm not one of those purists that thinks every little incident and character mentioned in the books has to be translated to the screen, but I think they might have tried to do too much this time out. We've got a very busy movie that doesn't really have a strong narrative arc leading through it. Again, I much preferred Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to this muddled mess, though it does have its strengths, notably Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. Next time out, they're going to really have to work harder on a screenplay that streamlines and clarifies the story, or else they're going to have to go the other direction and give us a three-hour movie.",5,1,2,22 November 2005
Blow," Not Bad--Drug Dealing Sure Looks Like Fun!
","I really enjoyed the film, until I heard a mean-spirited commentary about it on NPR a few hours later, and then started to agree with what that critic was saying about the misogyny on display.  Also, the film might be faulted for the simple fact that it makes drug-dealing look like fun--though it must also be said that the downsides are also given full rein.  Johnny Depp is his usual great self--he can disappear into almost any role and he really becomes George Jung, the amiable guy who graduates from world-class marijuana smuggler to full-blown cocaine dealer.  Also, there's a nice sense of the passage of time, as the easygoing 70s give way to the harder-edged 80s.  Paul Reubens has something of a career-turnaround with his role as a gay hairdresser who is Jung's/Depp's connection.  This certainly isn't _Traffic_ or _Scarface_, but there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours.",Null,0,0,9 April 2001
Signs," Shyamalan seems to be on a downward spiral
","Newsweek had a recent cover story calling him 'the new Spielberg,' but I for one am just about ready to start disbelieving the hype and wait for M. Night Shyamalan's films to show up on video or HBO.  I realize that it is unrealistic to expect an experience like the one I had with _The Sixth Sense_ every time out, but after the disappointing _Unbreakable_, I had high hopes for _Signs_.  All I can say is that this new movie is even more disappointing.  And it's strange, too, because Shyamalan is obviously a gifted director with a talent for drawing out strong performances from his casts.  I was really bothered by the story in _Unbreakable_, which really only got going near the end.  Here, the story never gets going--we're treated to 2 hours of buildup to, one suspects, something extraordinary, but what we get is not much of anything.  If the surprise in the film is that the whole thing is really all about how Mel Gibson gets his faith back, well, I have to say, that's a pretty poor payoff for all the time and emotion invested in the film, both by the filmmakers and the audience.There are scares and there is suspense and there are 'jump-out-of-your-seat' moments, but ultimately, the movie really isn't about much of anything.  I hope that, next time around, M. Night Shyamalan really works on a screenplay with a third act, with some sort of satisfying resolution to his story. Mark me down as someone who was dissatisfied with _Signs_.",Null,1,1,5 August 2002
