Blade Runner 2049," I loved the original, but didn't like this sequel.
","The only reason I gave this a 3 instead of a 1 or 2 was because it had Harrison Ford in it, and he played his part well, and because it presented some interesting and well-done technology. It was reasonably well made, as it should be for a high-budget movie, but this movie was slow - boring even. After watching it I figured the director must have been a British friend of Ridley Scott (the director of the original movie and also from Great Brittain - England - the U.K.), because it didn't seem like it could have been directed by Ridley Scott. It would have been better if it had been. I was wrong about the director's origin, but not his lack of directing ability. I really wish Ridley Scott had directed this movie. He has better taste. He knows where to put sound and where not to . . . and how loud to make it. He has a better sense of timing, and I think many things would have been done a little bit differently, if Ridley Scott had directed it.One thing I didn't like about this movie was that they overdid so much in it, like the symbolism. There was all sorts of extra symbolism in this movie that looked to be injected into it at random, as if the writers or director had some political agenda or something. That really bothered me. Why not just tell the story and stop trying to inject your green political agenda into the movie guys? We recycle now. I don't think that's going to stop. The in-your-face pollution was over the top.Sorry I can't give more details, because I don't want to inadvertently write a spoiler.Even though I went into this one expecting it to fall short of the original Blade Runner movie, I was still disappointed. It REALLY didn't live up to the level of the first Blade Runner . . . and who picked that terrible name?!? In the final analysis I have to say I would not recommend this movie to anyone, while I recommend the original Blade Runner movie to people all the time. I doubt I'll ever watch this newer Blade Runner movie again, but I'll definitely watch the old one again.",3,9,18,10 October 2017
The Terminator," Awesome and innovative sci-fi action movie that is less sci-fi and more thriller.
","This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Arnold plays his part well, but it's the other characters that really help this movie shine. James Cameron created a masterpiece when he made this movie. It was interesting, exciting, and frightening. It's the number one movie I recommend to people who like sci-fi movies, if they haven't seen it yet.",9,2,3,10 October 2017
