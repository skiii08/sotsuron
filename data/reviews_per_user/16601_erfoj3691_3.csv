E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A film for Homer Simpson
",Spielberg sucks in every movie. But people loves him. What a wonderful world.,1,0,23,24 August 2019
Cast Away," A non family guy
","Chuck has no family at all, no parents, no siblings. Nobody is waiting for him. Is that some kind of message or just lousy writing?",4,0,4,29 December 2019
The Godfather," Shallow characters, unrelated sketches.
","There's no transition between Michael I (american hero, away of family business) and Michael II (Sicilian mobster). The shooting of Vito and the assassination of Sonny maybe explains a psychological turn to revenge (a little material showing the attachment between Michael and each of them would have been nice), but it's not enough for this transformation into a full-fledged mafia manager, interested in brothels and casinos. The character of Kay is pathetic, living among criminals and believing Michael's promises about changing his way of life. The whole movie is a collection of excuses to present sketches of violence.",4,0,3,11 August 2012
