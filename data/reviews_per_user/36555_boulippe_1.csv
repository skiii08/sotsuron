United 93," Excellent movie, very touching and stress full
","Excellent movie I was Thrilled and touched and I was knowing the ending in advance, A must see if you want to learn about our own history in our modern world. Not to preachy or to nice for the American, i like that subtlety. This his a surprisingly good film for many reason. Not for the weak or the fragile. I have heard that they separate the comedian who play the passenger and the comedian who play the terrorist, the method seem to work in the unconscious body language of all the comedian involve in the project. The movie also target most of the problem in the chain of command concerning the way decision were made at the time. I wish that since that time they have improve their method and that the next (i wish it will never happened actually) will be deal with a lot more efficiency!",9,0,2,17 May 2006
