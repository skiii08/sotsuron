Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The best comedy of 2006 and for 2007.
","Why for 2007? because there wasn't anything funnier than Borat up until Step Brothers.Borat combines real comedy with real people and real reactions. I mean he's no stranger in most of Europe. He does make a show called 'Da Ali G Show' which features his 3 characters, Ali G: An idiotic wanna-be 'gangster' who tries to impersonate the lifestyle of a gang banger, with very little intelligence, but still very funny. Bruno, a homosexual fashion critic who's Austrian and loves gossip. Borat, a immigrant to other countries, comes from Khazakstan, and pretends to act like a complete tool in his interviews by acting the way he was raised in his country with his traditional customs.They all have three films too, for each character. Well, Bruno is a few days away from release. But his Borat character is probably the best one, ever.He travels to U.S. 'and' A to make a documentary about American customs and culture to 'make benefit of Khazakstan' . He looks on his TV one night and notices his love of his life, Pamela Anderson playing the lovely Baywatch babe, CJ. He sets his journey to find this woman and make 'explosion on her stomach' after marrying her. Throughout the journey, he continues his documentary in many of the famous states in America such as Texas and Atlanta, but ultimately stopping at California to meet Pamela Anderson.In his journey, he interviews real people, real American citizens who have an opinion or two about Borat or his and their idealistic views of class, race, pride, and women. The reason this is so funny is because of the reactions of people being filmed. They just don't know what to do in those situations, so they try to defuse it with their emotions and facial gestures.A few shows or clips on the internet have done this sort of thing, but it was all scripted, and most of it came from MTV. So, wherever there's a scripted reality show, there's MTV. The movie exploits Borat's findings in America. One of the funniest parts was the church convention. You'd see these crazy Christians on stage hollering about Jesus saving a troubled person by shouting out all sorts of gibberish that you'd hear from a mental patient in the hospital. So, I guess in a way, this film does exploit some of America's hidden and outrageous culture, and does a very good job at it.After the movie, a few people wanted to sue the film-makers for lying to them about what the project was really about. I can understand why they're mad. Maybe they should of thought of that before saying something stupid on camera. A few people in Romania, my home country were pretty angry about the film, saying it exploited them in a very bad way. It did, but there's no reason why they should sue. This movie gets a solid 10/10 for pure comedy realism. Go get this on DVD if you haven't. I can still watch this film over again and have even more laughs than before.",10,0,0,30 June 2009
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2 hits all the sweet spots, and it is GODLY.
","When I first heard that Iron Man was being made into a movie, I didn't care much, but I still wanted to see it because of the action. I also chose to see it because Robert Downey Jr. was playing the role of Iron Man/Tony Stark. I've been a fan of Rob since Chaplin, that was truly a masterpiece, he can work the English accent perfectly. I always thought he was English because the first movie I saw with him was Natural Born Killers, but he was obviously Australian in that.Anyways, I finished watching the movie and I was blown away by the sheer awesomeness of it. So, I chose to go back on my comic book hobby that I used to have 8 years ago. I first picked up on the World's Most Wanted storyline that is part of the Dark Reign event. I was hooked, so I decided that Iron Man is my new favourite Marvel hero, next to Blade, they're on the same level of epic. I read a famous story arc called 'Extremis'. I LOVED IT! I loved the dark tone to it, the virus created by Pharmlabs in Austin, Texas somehow slipped into some criminal's hands and he went haywire. Iron Man saved the day by taking the same dose of Extremis, he and the suit TRULY BECAME ONE, just like he says at the Senate conference in this movie. I won't say much because you'll love reading it, and it's really fun acting out the captions.Anyways, the next storyline I'm reading is Civil War, it's interesting to see his position in all of it. I still have 74 issues to go. My point is, if you're an Iron Man fan like me, and if you read the comics (which REALLY helped) then you will consider this the best movie in move-making history. I certainly do, we will see how the Avengers can top this, but I know Iron Man 3 will top Iron Man 2.Now, onto the movie. The intro starts off really well, with recordings from the ending of the first film where he announces that he is indeed Iron Man. It then cuts to Moscow, Russia where we get to see Whiplash's character intro. Truly sad to see the hand dealt to his father, Anton, apparently his father worked with Howard Stark, Tony Stark's father, and somewhere along the line, Howard took Anton's ideas and kicked him to the curb, in the Russian ghetto. Whiplash swore revenge on this, and let me just say the way the Monaco scene was setup was just AMAZING.On top of the movie being awesome, it even added humour to it, just like in the last one. Happy Hogan gets more screen time and lines. We get to see more of Nick Fury and the sexy, and seductive, Black Widow just to put the cherry on top. Justin Hammer, rival competitor to Tony Stark and Stark Industries wants to conquer over Stark Industries with H.A.M.M.E.R. advanced weapons systems. But he knows that he can never get the praise and approval of the public like Tony gets. It triggers his ego to go haywire, he truly needs Tony to succeed with his company.Moving on to the plot which is very well done and fantastic. This is a Marvel fan's wet dream come true. It combines the story lines of Armor Wars and Demon in a Bottle. Tony Stark's arc reactor is keeping him alive and killing him now, at the same time. He needs to come up with a solution and a new suit, which he does later in the course of the plot. This film is truly a masterpiece directed by none other than the prestigious Jon Favreau. Him and Robert are the DREAM TEAM as I like to call it.The audience was cheering was laughter, enjoyment and praise. They gave it a standing ovation after the movie was over, a theatre full of joy. I must admit, I really do envy Robert Downey Jr. for the kind of man he is. He has been dealt with the hand of jail and he has had his own little demon in a bottle experience,but the got back up on top, along with Mickey Rourke and has been given a second chance, and he took it.The acting was superb by all the cast members. The special effects and action had fans like myself drooling for more of it, just to appreciate the sheer beauty of it. I can guarantee you that this movie will make A LOT of money, maybe even over 1 billion and I hope it does because of the incredible hype it has received and well deserved too.The movie has a special Captain America easter egg and a secret ending after the credits. So stay in your seats. The music was very well done and in the right moments.Iron Man 2 gets my envy and full respect. This is truly the movie of the year, and possibly the decade until Iron Man 3 can top it off. People asked has the Dark Knight set standards too high for comic book movies? I'd say it didn't set them high enough, Iron Man 2 SURPASSES TDK in every way possible. This movie is godly. Rob and Jon are the dream team, never forget that people and Hollywood. They are the future of the movie industry. LONG LIVE IRON MAN!P.S. Oh and as of this year from May 6th to May 10th, you should all celebrate IRON MAN DAYS. On those four days, celebrate the great achievement Stan Lee and Jack Kirby has created.",10,23,47,7 May 2010
The Fifth Element," One of the best sci-fi movies of the 90's and our generation.
","Seriously, this movie was very ahead of its time. I don't know what sprung in the director, but this movie was pure genius. There's so much originality in this and a lot of creativity. You know how when you watch a James Cameron movie and at the end of it you're like 'holy crap, this movie feels as if it came out this year'. Well, this is exactly how I felt about this movie. It's just like a James Cameron movie, way ahead of its time, well, the 90's.The city with the flying cars, floating Chinese take-out, and cigarettes that have the filter backwards, I love this film! I can watch this movie over and over again and it would still feel new to me. Thanks to blu-ray technology, I can see it in beautiful high definition followed by some nice surround sound system.The visuals and special effects were very amazing for a 90's movie. And this is 1997, you wouldn't expect much from movies in the 90's in terms of nice special effects, with the exception of T2. But this movie delivered on a massive scale.Gary Oldman is the villain. Not the brightest villain, but he's cool. We have cameo appearances from trip hop artist, Tricky, as Gary Oldman's sidekick I guess? Bruce Willis, one of my favorite actors plays the role of the sarcastic action hero. He pairs up with the hot and sexy Milla Jonovich. That scene where she was created by the machines got me a little excited cause she's just so sexy. Chris Tucker is in it and he's just such a goof. It's kinda hard to tell whether he's straight or gay because of weird fashion the world of the Fifth Element serves its citizens, but nonetheless, it fit the world, because it needed something new.The plot is another save the world from the bad guy scenario, with a twist. You have this deadly planet coming for earth, which looks like an asteroid, but apparently the planet speaks because it's alien, and the main group of hero's must gather all the stones which would be placed in a temple in Egypt to stop the impending attack on earth. You have a gang of mercenary-type aliens who can shape-shift into humans and use any means of violence to accomplish their goals.The main group of hero's are also joined by a priest by British actor, Sir Ian Holm, who does a phenomenal job on his part. The worlds and locations in this film are just stunning and beautiful, it's like you wish the world looked like that today, but sadly it doesn't look anything close to what the Fifth Element looked like.Overall, this movie gets a 10/10 for originality, creativity, and stunning visuals. If you haven't seen this, then you should, because this should be on the list of movies you should watch before you die. Buy this movie, it's worth every penny. I look at other sci-films today that involve a similar plot and I can't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed this movie. I wish the director had the ambition to make a sequel for this, because it's under-rated. Long live the Fifth Element.",10,14,24,7 June 2009
127 Hours," 127 Hours of excitement, adrenaline, regret, and awesome!
","I LOVE this movie! OK, got that off my chest. Anyways, as I write this review, I'm listening to the song at the start of the movie, called 'Never Hear Surf Music Again' by the Free Blood. Worth a listen, search it on you-tube. But anyway this was from beside the point of how much I love and recommend this movie to everyone living on planet Earth right now.I saw the movie with high expectations and was disappointed that it wasn't over 2 hours long, but the movie made up for that because the pacing was good and it felt right. The intro to the movie is going to be on my top ten movie intros of all time, reaching in at number 1. For now. The song worked so well and naturally every song and score in this movie worked perfectly, even if it felt out of place at times, which also felt in place! At the same time! Like I said, I am listening to the intro song as I write this. It's so addicting! 127 Hours is the story of Aron Ralston's life-changing experience in 2003 which was news nationwide. He even won person of the year awards. But the story goes that he goes on this canyoning trip somewhere in Utah and while there, he meets two girls that he spends some time showing them around the place because they're lost. After they mingle and leave, he's invited to a party setup by them and he accepts. So he continues to trek for the rest of the day around Utah's beautiful rocky caves.Unfortunately, one open gap leading down into a cave decides his fate for the next few, long, painful days. Aron decides to go on further between the narrow cave gap, and the rock he tested by stomping on it to see if it will fall, falls on him and sends him down the cave, making his arm stuck in the process. After he realizes he's screwed beyond belief he tries to make the best of it, tries to keep himself calm and tries not to think of the worst.Given that he's an engineer, he tries to salvage as much water as possible to survive for the next 127 hours. The only thing he regrets the most? Not leaving a note (which he does now in real life). At the start of the movie, you can hear a phone ringing, and when it goes to voice message, it's his mother saying hi. So, he regrets not picking up the phone because he could have told his mother where he was going, and that would have been his salvation ultimately.After realizing that mistake, the fun begins. He has visions of his past in his youth with his family and events that he thinks lead him to his unfortunate fate. But he tries not to go on the Karma route explanation because he doesn't believe in fate, neither do I. He believes that life is what you make of it, and so do I.So, he does what he can to survive in this entrapment he's in for the next few days. As days pass by, he keeps on hoping and dreaming that he'll free himself, but all his attempts fail. He even has hallucinations of the freedoms he once enjoyed before being in the position he was in. It's like the director actually wants you to believe that there's no hope. But there is. He has a solution which failed before, but not again. He wants to cut off his arm to break free from the trap he's in.Let me tell you, not a pretty scene to watch, but he cuts off his whole arm and breaks free from the grip. He eventually gets an emergency airlift and he is re-united with his family and friends once again. There is a brief cameo from the real Aron Ralston just after the end of the movie. This movie is what happened to the real Aron Ralston back in 2003 and that's why he won so many awards, because of the many obstacles he overcame at impossible odds that not many would sacrifice to get freedom the way he did.And I can't help but think how awesome would it be if Chris Mccandless still lived today; what he would say to Aron Ralston, or better yet, to put them in a room together interviewing each other, becoming great friends and take a canyon trip and record their journey. It would be like two titans coming together, a meeting of the minds. If you don't know who Chris is, then please read the book 'Into the Wild' or watch the movie, or do both.Anyways, I now depart and hopefully you've enjoyed my thorough review of 127 hours. If you have not watched it, I insist you do watch it. Day 1 blu-ray buy for me, that's for sure!",10,1,4,9 January 2011
Terminator Salvation," You'd have to be slow not to understand the story and admire its awesomeness
","What a great movie! It deserves its 10/10 because not only is it action packed, but it expands the story, and it visits the future that was shown in the opening intros for T1, T2, and T3. And as a kid, I've always wanted to see a Terminator film set in the future, and thanks to McG & Warner Bros, I have a film that's set in the future.Okay, so it's not in 2029, it's in the earlier days, a few years right after Skynet launched their missiles and the humans called it 'Judgement Day' . You get to see John Connor as a ranking resistance fighter, not in full command, yet, but working his way up there. He still has that rebellious attitude, Edward Furlong had in T2.Now I won't ride the hate bandwagon and join in to bash T3 or say how Salvation sucks and T2 is the best JUST BECAUSE. Because let's face it, you grew up with Terminator 2, most of you did. I was 2 years old when it came out, so I got to watch it 8 years later. Given the quality of the movie and the director for it, it was a great movie, and it's on Terminator Salvation's level. However, this new movie surpasses it, slightly more. Now don't get all crazy cuz I said that, because I'm a fan. What, because I don't agree with you I'm not a fan? Get the hell outta' here with that crap.The movie is great, go see it, you have to be really slow, dumb, or just ignorant to not understand the plot of this movie. It's John Connor in his resistance days, rising up to the ranks, to win the war sooner than his mother told him. Marcus Wright comes into play because he volunteered for a Cyberdine program to donate his insides, but he doesn't know he becomes what he becomes later on. I'll try not to spoil it, so don't worry.The plot later tells us that John needs to save his young, would-be father, Kyle Reese from a Skynet concentration camp. There will be a cameo role in this movie by a special someone you may all know by now, but I won't say anything, because as I mentioned before, I won't say anything spoiler related.The action is certainly great, great use of the 200 million dollar budget. The Harvester scene is amazing, that's all I'm gonna' say. It's not a mindless action movie as how some people on this site put it out to be, so vividly. I think if you're a Terminator fan, a science fiction fan, a war movie fan, or a fan of Cristian Bale, then you will like this movie. So please, go see it, pay for it so it can make the box office bust, so that I can be another happy camper when they show the trailer for Terminator 5 and 6 thanks to this movie's success at the box office. The only problem I had with it is the fact that it wasn't longer. That is all.",10,6,12,28 May 2009
The Expendables," This decades BEST action movie.
","2010, the last year of the Y2K generation or decade. 2011 is the start of a new age, a new generation and a new decade into film and everything else.You're not supposed to go to this movie expecting to be moved by the story or for the story to make you think. You're supposed to go to this movie and think 'Yeah, I paid this much money to see a movie with kick-ass action and guns, I can't wait!'. Sylvester Stallone has been known to make action movies and have roles in more than he can count. But this movie delivers 100 levels of high-octane action. You film geeks and critics can't grasp that fact. You expect a story, something to make you think. Well this movie does that. Everyone who lived through the 80's and 90's can re-collect their memories of Rambo, Predator and movies alike that had balls to the wall action and enjoy the old glory days. But you critics are something else. You obviously don't know the audience this movie is sold to. But you see, this movie made people think. When I saw some of the most bad-ass action scenes I thought to myself, wow, words can not describe the joygasm I am having watching this. F****** BADASS!. F*** YEAH!. That's why it did so well in the box office, but again you critics cannot grasp that. In fact, why are there official jobs for being a critic? They shouldn't be paid to write a few paragraphs. They should only be information sources people go to if they want spoilers or opinions, but unfortunately these low lives get paid to do that type of job. The world has gone upside down. It truly has.But let's get back on track. This movie is for the action fanatic, for the kid in you that wants to spring back out and enjoy your old child-hood of what life was growing up in whatever decade you were a kid in. I was a 90's kid, but was born at the height of the 80's. In 1989 to be specific, so I didn't have the luxury to be hyped for the latest action movie from heavy hitting stars like Arnie or Sly. I instead grew up with their movies on VHS in the 90's, and to see that cast come back alive with some of my other favourite action stars was a dream come true. Seeing Arnie and Sly talk for just that 2 minutes alone was a dream come true. You know, I kept watching Last Action Hero and Demolition Man to lookout for how Arnie talks about Sly in that fictional T2 poster with Sly on the cover or how John Spartan goes to the future in Demolition Man to be informed by Sandra Bullock's character that Arnie IS the president. And funny thing is, he is in politics now and I think I've heard him wanting to run for that shot of the big man in the White House. But aside from those two movies, I ALWAYS, for as long as I can remember; have been wanting to see Arnie and Sly in one movie together, face to face and this movie does that for me.I thank Sly for his contribution to the world for this amazing work of film. On such a low budget, he managed to make the 80's and early 90's come out in us, adults. He re-awakened our inner child, of what it meant to enjoy life before the expectations society has set out on you after you entered high-school and finished it. He made me feel like a kid again. I think I might just cry. 10 out of 10. You are the man, Stallone, you truly are.",10,14,24,11 September 2010
The Love Guru," It's basically Austin Powers 4 with normal characters.
","How did Mike Myers get a career in Hollywood, period? none of his films are funny. Not even Wayne's World. Sure, I used to laugh like an idiot as his Austin Powers films when I was little, but keep in mind, I was a kid, I would be amused by anything, even if it's stupid today. I had somewhat of a hope for it because of Romany Malco who did pretty well in 40-year old virgin, I liked his character and it's a shame he signed on to this crap-fest of a film. Hell, SuperHero Movie is funnier than this crap.I also watched it for Jessica Alba because who's to argue that she's the hottest woman in the world. She was the only thing that kept me watching this movie. If she wasn't in it, I'd stop the movie after 5 minutes and return it to the video store for my money back. Luckily, I rented it.Seriously, this is just another Austin Powers sequel with real normal characters in it. It's the same type of humor that Austin Powers had. Also, Ben Kingsley, a great actor signed on to this film, he just lost his credibility for that. I'm not surprised with Jessica starring in this movie, she'll do any kind of movie, cuz she's clearly in it for the money, but let's face it, you go to Hollywood to make money, because I love money too, I could care less about an academy award performance. I can't sell the trophy, it's not worth anything.Anyway, 1/10 for being even more stupid than the Austin Powers series. At least those movies had Seth Green and the tent shadow scene. I wish I could rate it a -100/10. Don't buy this, and don't waste money on renting it either. This is clearly for the tweens and 8 year olds. I'm surprised this movie got a pg-13, might as well make it a G for everyone and add Disney to the title. Clearly a tween movie. That is all.",1,9,18,5 June 2009
Into the Wild," Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen this decade.
","I don't know if anything else can top it. I mean, it's like I'm watching an Oscar performance and Planet Earth at the same time. This movie has some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen. Well, I am a sucker for beauty in nature and that's what really convinced me to finally see this movie.Emile Hersch does a terrific acting job, and his character is believable all the way. You kind of hate him at first because you think he's selfish and immature for what he's doing, but as you go along, you kinda understand what he really wants. To enjoy life. He had this note on his diary of his travels saying 'life was less hard when I was penniless' or something along the lines of that. I couldn't help but think that he's referring to his child-hood. And if he is, he is so right. Life was easy for all of us kids when we grew up.I don't remember having to worry about the most serious disease, about paying the bank on time or about my future career. I had the best time of my life, but that innocence is taken away from us once we reach a certain age in our lives. Like his was. I bet that's one of the reasons he set out on his adventure.Anyway, like I said, I'm a sucker for beautiful locations, this movie really set the tone. One of my favorite parts was when he met Wayne and helped around the wheat fields, was it? Anyway, I loved that whole segment because it reminds me of my home in Europe, we all had to do the same thing if we wanted to have food on our table, but then the sunset scene where the sky was a beautiful tint of pink, and purple with a little hint of red. I LIVE FOR THOSE MOMENTS! I truly do. We may go to war with each other because we don't agree with something, but at the end of the day after we've killed each other off, we can find peace in the beauty of what nature, or Earth has to offer. He wanted to escape in it. He didn't care about material things, he just wanted to get the most out of his life. I sometimes was wondering if he did it to put his pathetic parents to a test, to see how far they would go to find him. But instead, they stay home and wait for the authorities to do their jobs.This movie is truly unforgettable to say the least. It's on my blu-ray buy list and I hope there are many more movies like this. Emile Hersch can act and Hollywood needs to give him way more roles and a lot of money, because he's one of the few younger actors who isn't talentless and has class. I also wish to give my condolences to the real Chris McCandless, who sacrificed everything in his life to get the full experience of life. This is not a movie about being nice to one another, or being a charity center, it's a movie about life, nature and how to get the most out of it. It's a movie about the meaning of life, and Chris McCandless truly discovered that. May he rest in peace.",10,0,1,24 September 2010
Avatar," The new era of film begins with Avatar
","I am still in awe. This film has surpassed the visual barriers. It is the marking the beginning of a new era in film. Why do I say that? Because it's done by James Cameron and after-all, he has surpassed technological barriers before with the release of Terminator 2 and Titanic in the 90's.This movie has been in the making for over 15 years and it looks like it has paid off. James wanted to wait till technology got better, then he got his inspiration from Lord of the Rings. He took that inspiration and he perfected so that NO ONE will ever make a movie this good for a very long time, visually. He created the camera, the graphics, basically he created new technology and this opens SO MANY windows of opportunities for other film-makers in Hollywood. The next decade of sci-fi, or special effects driven films will look like Avatar thanks to James Camerons' technology.Now to the story. This is such a beautiful tale of a man with a disability who befriends a different species outside of our solar system and respects their way of life. Now a lot of people compare this movie with 'Dances With Wolves' but I have never seen that movie so I can't say anything and it seems that people love comparing films nowadays to feel like they deserve to have an opinion. Anyway, on with the story. After our main hero befriends the Na'vi populace, he has a change of heart and sides with them, the militia that has populated Pandora doesn't like this, they just want their materials and will kill anything in their path to have it.The Na'vi are not a violent species unless they are pushed over the edge. The humans who inhabit the planet only want raw materials that sell for 20 million a kilo. A lot of other parasites have said that it makes fun of Americans and their way of life, of how they seek nothing else but to dominate everything in its path. I mean, isn't that true? They love doing that, and they have been doing that for the last 200 years. But this movie is not about that egotistical, and arrogant country, it's about the human species when it comes into contact with another species; we hunt them down if they don't co-operate or if they we think they're a nuisance, and on top of that, claim their land as ours. It's true though, we would do that if we wanted to colonize on another planet with another species. We would kill them. No wonder aliens don't visit us, we're f***ed up.Anyways, I can't stress it more that you MUST see this movie. It's one of those movies you should see before you die. Even if it's your last day before you die because you have a critical disease or condition; you have to see this film. It will make your life and your death so worthwhile. You will die in awe. Definitely a blu-ray purchase in my books. 10/10 for a visual evolution, a breathtaking story and an outstanding experience in IMAX 3D..the way it was meant to be seen.",10,56,98,19 December 2009
Zombieland," One of the best comedies of this generation, and movies of 2009
","F*****g awesome intro!!!. Amazing characters, fairly simple but FUN plot. Bill Murray shows up in it, and it's a funny scene after scene with him.So where to begin the praise and envy I have for this movie? I really don't know because the movie is goddamn good. It's such a feel good movie that you just wanna see it again and again. I know I'm getting this for blue-ray when it comes out. I never felt so good after watching this movie. I literally walked out happy and full of life, it made me want to play fallout 3 on ps3, going on a killing spree shooting every feral ghoul I could find, like Tallahasse.When I first saw the trailer, I knew it was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be as good as I think it is now. I'm sorry if I keep repeating myself, but this movie is just what the movie industry needs. This is like the American sequel to Shaun of the Dead, which was an awesome movie as well, but Zombieland is much better.It was slapstick humour, but VERY GOOD slapstick humour. That's what I call comedy. Glad this movie made the IMDb top 250, I think it deserves to be in the top 20 though, a spot under The Hangover. The narration by the lead actor was great, the character's personality is what you'd expect from today's kid. Not that it's a bad thing, I love keeping myself isolated so I can enjoy playing my video-games.Woody Harleson was so great in this film, I personally think this is his best movie, ever. I know, people will argue that Natural Born Killers was his best. It was, until I saw this movie. And I never was that much of a fan of his. I always thought he was a weird guy in real life, but this character really suits him. The zombie-killing redneck who has nothing to lose because the very same thing that made zombieland killed his son, his only innocence in life. He was a devoted father, who after seeing his son die, became a devoted redneck killing machine.It's great how this movie combines every human emotion at the right parts. Because the irony of it is that human life is great, what would the world be without humans ans just mindless zombies? I recommend this movie to anyone with a good sense of humour and people who are laid back and not up-stuck liberals. You probably shouldn't go with your kid to the movie, you should let him/her go by themselves. I'd probably recommend this movie to virtually anyone.And finally, the bonus ending was LOL! Nonetheless, after watching this movie and walking out, you'll feel really good, you'll feel all types of good emotions. You're happy you spent money on this movie, you probably want to buy it on DVD or blue-ray, and/or you will see it again with someone who hasn't just because it's so good. This was truly the best 90 minutes of my life I've ever had. I hope this gets the cult classic title, and I think it will. A lot of people will remember this movie 10-20 years down the road, and we'll probably pop it in your video player or whatever technology exists out there in the future. This is the feel good movie of 2009, and I'd say it's in my top 5 movies of 2009, I hope this wins an Oscar, but it won't since Oscars are saved for Oscar bait movies like the reader and the curious case of Benjamin button. GO SEE IT, IF YOU DON'T....YOU HAVE NOT LIVED.",10,1,5,4 October 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Action movie of the year
","I was very hyped for this movie, not as much as I was for Terminator: Salvation, but as soon as I saw that superbowl spot, I was creaming my pants.It was a hell of a ride seeing this movie in IMAX. I could see Optimus Prime in his 50 feet of metal on screen, it's as if I'm in the movie, just like IMAX says in their intro.The action was great, the story was great, Megan Fox was hot as ever, and the visual effects were revolutionary! Only Avatar may surpass this film in the visual effects department.Despite what you may have read on these boards, they're wrong about the film. They're expecting an academy award movie from a title that says 'Transformers' in it. I mean, common, get a grip on reality people, this movie was great, you're just hopping on the hate bandwagon because you think you're a true fan, but I know you're not, don't lie to yourselves.Anyways, go see this movie, it's a fun, action-packed ride that will make you want to see it again and get it on blu-ray. I know I'm buying a copy of this excellent movie on blu-ray whenever it hits stores. Also, if you guys happen to have a copy of the first movie on blu-ray, then check out the bd-live section for new special features.Otherwise, go see this movie, and don't bring your kids, it has swear words and sexual jokes in it, which are very funny by the way. Michael Bay has yet again, made another great film for everyone to see..well not everyone, especially the people of IMDb.com to say the least. 10/10 for the perfect summer movie. Terminator 4 is on the same level as this, but this one surpasses it just by a bit. Watch it in IMAX.",10,22,53,27 June 2009
Iron Man," Iron-Badass
","I was hyped for the movie when it was on the internet as news. I wasn't the biggest fan of Iron-Man at the time, but I always liked Robert Downey Jr., because he's a phenomenal actor. Not only that, but having Jon Favreau on board made me want to watch this film even more. He's a great comedic actor, and would seem like a cool buddy to hang out with.So I went in there with high expectations and I came out very satisfied at what I just had seen. I couldn't think of anyone else who could play Iron-Man better than Robert Downey. Thanks to this film, I put Iron-Man at the second spot in my favorite super-hero list. Blade comes first.Of course I bought the blu-ray version of the movie, watched all the special features and it was great. The action was great, it was planned out where it was needed. Jeff Bridges also did a great job on his character, acting as a mentor and then as Iron-Man's enemy. He didn't like to put up with the selfish rich guy, I get it, no one likes that.Overall, a 10/10 for creativity. Now, I'm anxious for the sequel, and you know what they say about sequels, they're always the best ones in the series.",10,6,6,31 May 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," This is probably the best drama/action/thriller I have ever seen in this decade...it deserves the IMDb top 10 spot
","WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!!! I love this movie! I can't stress how amazing this movie was. It was so unpredictable the whole time. The judge office scene was amazing, I honestly did not expect that. It just adds to how badass Gerard Butler's character is, and how badass Gerard is in real life for being in this movie. This guy can not only do great comedies (the ugly truth), but he can do thrillers and action movies with flying colors (see 300).Where do I start with this? Well first off, let me get this off my chest. If you decide not to see this movie just because you heard of it having gore in it, then you do not deserve to live. Simple as that really. You can't go on with your life without seeing this movie. I can only hope this movie wins an Oscar, but those only get saved for cheap Oscar bait movies like the reader and benjamin button, it's a shame the Oscars are so biased.The movie starts off with the plot right off the bat at the intro. The cause and effect. The effect is what gerard butler is doing as his character to anyone who let those scumbag criminals get a free pass. You kinda' hate the Jamie Foxx character at first, but then you start to understand his reasons, but you still end up rooting for gerard butler's character till end credits. The ending is great, well executed. Many people compare this movie to the Dark Knight, and gerard butler's character to the joker. I can see why, and frankly, this movie is 5 times better than the dark knight.I heard of kurt wimmer before, well only when I heard that he will be directing the metal gear solid movie, and now that I've seen this movie, I can't wait to see metal gear solid directed by him, he's PERFECT for that movie. This movie just proves that he can do action espionage action even more. This movie did kinda have action espionage in it, especially Gerard's character, he was trained in that field for whomever he was working for in the past. You can kinda notice it at the opening intro of the movie when he works on something.All I gotta say is, he's still a hero no matter what he did in this movie. And very badass too. This guy makes the pulp fiction lead characters look like little school girls. I can only hope that whenever I become a successful Hollywood film-maker, I can reach a step close to this movie. This is the best movie I have seen so far in the first decade of the new millennium, I don't think anything else can take the cake. Now, I wait for the day when a movie is made to surpass this.Not only is this movie badass, but it just proves that revenge is ALWAYS the answer and is very sweet and satisfying. If this happened to a family member of mine, my mother, I would go nuts! I'd kill everyone responsible for it. The lesson here is: Everyone is held accountable for what they do/did. Do not pass on this movie, seriously. This is certainly a blu-ray buy in my books. 10/10 for an amazing plot, an amazing acting performance, and an amazing director with fine directing and creative skills. I really hope to work with Kurt Wimmer some day. And if anyone on the crew of this movie is reading this review, I got some pretty good news for you guys, all the shows were sold out, it was full. I wish you good luck and I hope this movie takes the box office for this, and next month so that we can see more great movies from you, Kurt. I'm really looking forward to Metal Gear Solid.",10,2,14,16 October 2009
