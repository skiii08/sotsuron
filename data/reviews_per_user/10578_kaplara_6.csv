Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill: Vol. 2
","Kill Bill 2 is a movie whose plot is as simple as it's name. There is little below the surface here, but the movie simply runs amok on poorly developed characters and low grade action sequences. Yes I know the movie is designed to mock or make reference to many other movies, notably martial arts films, but rather then using those 'Hollywood' moments to enhance something Tarantino uses them like a crutch. Most of this is due to the plot, which with nothing new to offer simply flows in a boring and contrived way. In addition no major roles seem capable of overwhelming the poor script and dry substance of the movie. Its as if everyone there has resigned themselves to the fact that the script and plot are dead, and act a little on the dead side themselves.Uma Thermon is clumsy and unconvincing as a vengeful super assassin. At least in the first movie one is capable of viewing the ridiculously over the top action with a bit of a grin and saying nuts to the plot. O ren also helps with a few fun lines like, 'the price for mentioning my Chinese heritage as a negative is, I collect your f@#king head.' O ren in general is more convincing though not great in her role. Uma's awkwardness forces Tarantino into doing what I often view as the first sign of a bad action movie. He uses up close shots of the characters during fast moments and distance shots during slow ones. This usually means that were one to view what just occurred from a distance, they would see it for what it is, clumsy and uncoordinated.Overall this movie retains some of it's director's excellent tough mostly through the visuals, which taken as a picture rather then a moving film as breath taking. Tarantino makes use of start color contrasts to give one a sense of texture and beauty beyond the norm. Were I in the poster business I could take a thousand frames of this movie and make them into wonderful pieces of art. I should also note that I still believe in Tarantino, movies with finesse and masterful dialogues such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction do not happen by accident and shine no less for the latter mistakes of their maker. I rate Kill Bill one and two as 6 together, perhaps a 6.5 for 1 and a 5.5 for 2, they were simply not that interesting, sorry Q try again.~Tylahedras",4,3,6,20 December 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for my smile...
","There are some people who dislike movies which make them emotional; I am not one of those people. Requiem for a Dream is one of the most lucid, tantalizing horrors ever placed before my eyes. Forget the monster-slasher movies, forget the bloodstained battlefields, if you want to shudder at the horrors of human existence, you have but to watch this.The acting is amazing, everyone is good, and Ellen Burstyn is so good I will no long watch the academy awards. I will not go into the plot except to say it's about drugs, that's all you need to know. This film is creative, using split screens and wonderful camera work. It never feels hokey, and most importantly it makes you really want the characters to succeed. The tragedy is so great that it overwhelms you, dulling your senses. The musical score is haunting, and sticks in your mind for hours after the film.Perhaps the best proof of its greatness was my physical reaction. There are a select few movies which have moved me to tears; this movie brought me to the brink of vomit. Truly this is a cinematic masterpiece of the highest caliber. See it if you have the stomach.~Ryan",10,3,6,26 January 2005
Akira," Damn, and it started so well...
","A movie whose pace starts out well enough, but can't keep it going.When this movie opened I was surprised, the visuals are quite advanced, and the portrayal of a rebuilt future society is excellent. The movie is quite good up until it goes from being a weird mystery (What exactly is happening to that kid?) to being a pseudo-DragonballZ philosophical mess. Basically the movie feels like it was written in 1 night and the writer couldn't figure out how to end it, so he just filled the last hour with random fighting, which you at least could forgive if it led to something, but it doesn't. Overall it's very disappointing, such a waste of what seemed at least to be a solid movie with a solid plot.",5,7,14,28 November 2004
Jarhead," The classic that never was
","Although I think the finer points have been hit on, I wanted to add my two cents about what is bound to be an over looked classic. Perhaps I should start then by stating why exactly this movie is going to miss the mark, so to speak, while at the same time hitting it so precisely. In the end there are few things which do not boil down to politics, and while competitive democracy has its high points it creates a sort of vacuum of polarization with no in between. This is important because in a world where there is no middle road, we cannot take seriously something un-polarizing and un-opinionated. It's unfortunate but true and it's exactly why some people are going to be unable to enjoy this movie (a lot of people). In fact if you've ever held a protesters sign, regardless of the cause, there is a fairly high chance you will find the lack of moral direction here offensive.The movie quite literally does the impossible; it portrays war without attempting to lead the viewer to moral conclusions. In fact it is not so simple as to ignore these moral conclusions; you will find characters expressing them from both sides of the moral spectrum. In each case attempts by characters to frame the issue in a certain way simply fall flat in the face of reality. Over optimism finds itself faced with sad truth while true pessimism is never realized. And if the last sentence sounds like it should be impossible, then that is yet further truth of just how good (and different) this movie is.The objective of this film is to tell a story about people and the effects war has on them. It is funny, sad, disappointing, anticlimactic, beautiful, intense and frustrating especially if you were a character in it. I am not an easy judge of movies (quite harsh actually) but I do enjoy things which attempt a topic from a new angle. Perhaps the fact this is the first war movie which has no angle provides a sad insight into both why it is so good and why it will be so under-appreciated.~Ryan",9,1,1,19 November 2005
Grave of the Fireflies," What makes a movie great...
","I think often times one knows the value of the movie they watch through the effect it has on them. That being said, this is one of the greatest movies ever made. I watch movies from many cultures and of many genres. Though I usually prefer a good action flick to any kind of sentimental rubbish; that tends to be because most movies which try to be sentimental fall short of creating a reaction. This movie creates a reaction, a big reaction. One of the ways I test a movie's greatness is to re-watch it, a lot later. As time passes and the movie sinks in, it loses its power to effect you. I watched this movie in 1998; a month ago I tried to watch it again. I did not make it past the movies opening scene. I do not easily come to tears, but I could not watch this movie a second time, I could not bear that kind of pain. That is level of power this movie evokes, and that is the level of strength the story conveys. There is no way my words can properly express the feelings which this movie creates, do not be afraid because it is in a foreign language or because it is animated, what this movie touches transcends all that. There is no more to be said, watch it and find out for yourself what I mean.",10,4,5,21 November 2004
The Last Samurai," The last Hollywood waste?
","As may be gleaned from the above title, I was not terribly impressed with this film, which was not to say it didn't have high points.We'll start with what was impressive. Tom Cruise. The scene where he is selling rifles while drunk and half reliving his Indian fighting days had some creepy and impressive acting. When his military superior pulls him aside and Cruise tells him he'd kill him for free, chilling. When the translator asks how to scalp someone, and Cruise shows him, freaky. But these are just a few scenes; it's not that Cruise is bad during the rest of the movie, just that he has few lines which are at all impressive outside of those 3 scenes. Besides, by half way through the movie you're thinking oh not another boring Hollywood plot, which of course it is.Well, I was already started on what's bad, so I'll continue. Essentially although none of the acting is bad, the plot is stupid putrid Hollywood garbage. It is always so sad when a movie starts with promise and ends up being such a fizzle. I mean did he have to live with the wife of the man he killed? I mean if she didn't fall in love with him and just hated him throughout the movie I wouldn't care, but she did fall in love with him, how ridicules! To make matters worse, white boy insists on riding into battle dressed as a samurai, and being the only survivor to return the fallen master's samurai's sword to the emperor. Oh, and who can forget the scene in which all the Japanese military, who just finished the slaughter, bowed to the people they killed, STUPID. Hollywood needs some new ideas, why couldn't they have let the movie progress with good dialog and interesting introspection. I found the scene in which the master of the samurai was looking at the Indian pouch a very telling and powerful moment, no noise, no violence, no campy push for a tear, just letting what is be, and letting that have the power. Towards the end the movie has way too much slow motion death and forced sadness, it's hokey and over-dramatic.While this is no Battlefield Earth, I still could not recommend it overall. Parts of this movie show great potential, and parts reek of Hollywood hype.~Ryan",6,2,4,26 January 2005
