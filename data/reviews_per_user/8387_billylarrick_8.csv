Casablanca," The greatest movie ever made
","Casablanca is the pinnacle of what filmmaking can achieve and stands as a testament to the power of phenomenal acting and the power of a compelling story. A timeless classic, this movie stands above all others and should be watched again and again.CharactersThe brilliance of Casablanca begins and ends with Humphrey Bogart. Rick Blaine is the performance of a lifetime given by the world's most skilled actor. Here we see Bogart's incredible range on full display; he is the cutthroat and cynical saloon owner, the romantic in flashback, the jilted lover, and the heartbroken man who is torn between choosing the woman he loves and doing what he knows to be right. Bogart is entirely believable in this role, so much so that it's hard to imagine Bogey isn't the cynic with the heart of a sentimentalist that he portrays. When watching Casablanca and seeing the story of Rick's past romance with Ilsa unfold we feel his pain, we share his anger and his confusion as if it was our own, whether we are watching for the first time or the hundredth time. Rick is every man who has ever been in love, who has turned cynical after having his heart broken, and who will do anything—even sacrifice his own happiness —to ensure her happiness. To be able to connect with such a complex character is possible because of Bogart's genuine delivery. Bogart's role as Rick will stand the test of time as one of the most legendary performances in film history.Along with Bogey, the support he receives from every other actor in this film is astounding. Ingrid Bergman is flawless as Ilsa Lund. Her cold demeanor towards Bogey throughout most of the film combined with the frustrated love of his character creates the perfect chemistry. Bergman holds her cards tight to her chest and keeps us guessing as to whether she will choose to rejoin Rick or escape with her husband Victor Laszlo and even more importantly, which man she loves more. Rains portrayal of the French captain whose loyalty 'blows with the prevailing wind' is brilliant in its own right and in no way overshadowed by Bogey and Bergman. Part of what makes Rain's performance so impressive is that he is able to add a level of comic relief to the film while still maintaining the seriousness of a captain of the police when the occasion calls for it. He is both the man who can shut down Rick's Café for gambling while collecting his winnings. While Rick, Ilsa, and Rains are the primary focus of Casablanca, what puts this movie over the top is the depth of talent it receives from its secondary actors. There are strong performances all around from Sydney Greenstreet as the profit oriented businessman Senior Ferrari, Peter Lorre as the sleazy criminal Ugarte, and Sam as the warm-hearted and amenable pianist. These characters may not contribute on a large scale but their performances maintain the film's high quality of acting.Dialogue: Along with acting, what separates this film from all others are its lines. Not just the half dozen that appear in the American Film Institute's most famous movie quotes, twice as many as any other film, but lines like 'You'll get along beautifully in America,' 'There are vultures, vultures everywhere,' or 'I stick my neck out for nobodyA wise foreign policy' are what make this movie not only powerful but enjoyable to watch. It all starts with great acting but to be the best movie of all time you have to have a great script and Casablanca has the best.Music: 'As time goes by', 'Knock on wood', and 'The Marseilles' deliver a lot for just a few songs. The Marseilles scene is arguably the most emotional musical performance is cinema history, made especially powerful by the fact that many of the French citizens in the café were real-life emigrants during the war and shed real tears as they sang in the movie. While 'As Time Goes By' may be the song most famously remembered for Sam to play again, it is 'The Marseilles' that marks the turning point in the film. Showing the French citizens overpowering the Germans serves as a powerful symbol of the French resistance to the Nazis and was also written for an American audience that had just entered the war following Pearl Harbor only months earlier. The audience feels the genuine struggle of war-torn Europe instead of the artificial feel of propaganda that made some other films feel like a war time commercial and a cheesy ploy for enlistment. This scene is also of significant importance to the story because of what happens right before it. While it is Laszlo who tells the band to play the Marseilles, the band does not do so until Rick nods for them to go ahead. In this moment Rick does much more than tell the band to play, he breaks the last and most important of his precedents that he had maintained before Ilsa arrived: his neutrality. By nodding for the band to play, Rick knows that he is symbolically siding with the French and that the Germans will now view him as a threat to their mission to arrest Laszlo. It is in this moment that Rick makes the decision to help Laszlo and to give up Ilsa and his café. Scenes like this display the powerful acting at work in Casablanca and the beauty in the power that one look and a simple nod can have.Casablanca is simply the greatest movie of all time. Citizen Kane and The Shawshank Redemption cannot hold a candle to this movie and with the current trend towards emphasizing CGI over acting, it is possible no film ever will.

Nightcrawler," Jake G is creepy and it's awesome
","Jake Gyllenhaal stars as 'Lou' Bloom an aspiring 'nightcrawler' who hunts down accidents and crime scenes for footage to sell to news stations. Gyllenhaal's doll-eyed expression has flashes of Donnie Darko in them but is made even creepier by the broad faced grin which rarely leaves his face. Gyllenhaal is captivating in this role and shows a level of intensity he had not previously exhibited. An early example of this intensity, which he maintains throughout the film, is the scene where he fails to catch a fire on film after speeding wildly and talking at the rate of a coke addict. We see this same intensity man when Gyllenhaal is able to talk about Mexican food while Nina asks him twice about blood on his shirt. Gyllenhaal is careful not to play this role over the top but maintains his credibility as an unsympathetic psychopath.DirectingDirector Dan Gilroy makes great use of close-ups to focus on Gyllenhaal's doll-eyed face and upper torso, insuring that Gyllenhaal's acting is the focus of the movie which, given his acting ability in this performance, he should be. A very unique element of this movie is the insight Gilroy provides as to how a news team operates and manipulates the news. The camera-work done by Gyllenhaal's character is a clever way for Gilroy to show how effective camera-work is, particularly in the scene where Gyllenhaal and Rick are filming the two murder suspects and we see their filming through both men's camera lenses while the rest of our screen around their lens is blurred. We see this technique used again during the car chase scene in which Gyllenhaal and Rick pursue the police chase of the remaining murder suspect and much of the scene is shown through the lens of Rick's camera. StoryThe story begins as an almost cliché depiction of cutthroat journalists but quickly evolves to show these journalists possess a new level of emotional detachment from their stories. This is made clear when Nina tells Gyllenhaal to 'think of our newscast as a woman running bloody down the street with her throat cut.' A few times the limitations of this detachment are stretched, especially with the reporting of the home invasion, but ultimately we see that the manipulation of fear and lack of sympathy wins out as again and again Nina encourages her anchors to scare the public.Another main theme of this film is the relentless pursuit of success. Gyllenhaal tells the audience that 'why you pursue is as important as what you pursue' while also promoting the idea of hard work being the only way to attain success. This keeps the audience wondering whether the success of his business is really his motivation or if there is something else motivating him. His collection of his successful stories more resembles a mass murder keeping a display of trophies than a businessman driven to succeed. We see the beginning of Gyllenhaal's psychopathic tendencies when he turns down Paxton's offer to run a second van and the chance to make more money while also bluntly telling him that he feels like attacking him (the kind of matter of fact observational speech that sounds like a serial killer.) He repeats this process when he meets with Nina whom he bluntly tells which of her physical features he likes as well as threatening her job in the same meeting.There are also several pivotal moments that mark the exposure of Gyllenhaal's true nature. The first of these Pivotal moments transpires when Gyllenhaal realizes that he can move a dead driver's body to create a better shot. This leads him to become fully invested in his work as a nightcrawler and gives him the arrogance that brings about much of his frustration which pushes him over the edge when it comes to finding increasingly gory stories and competing with Paxton. While a few of the other journalists maintain their lack of sympathy for the death and violence in the world, we see this lack of emotion taken to another level with Gyllenhaal when he films Paxton being taken away in an ambulance and Gyllenhaal refers to his accident as 'profit' and again when he enters the home where a murder has just taken place in order to film the crime scene victims and all.Another pivotal moment comes during his negation with Nina in which he refuses to bargain for a lower price—a complete role reversal from the beginning of the film when it was the construction manager who refused to lower his price with Gyllenhaal.The final pivotal point happens when Gyllenhaal allows Rick to be killed by the second murderer telling him he 'cannot jeopardize the success of his company for the sake of an untrustworthy employee.' This scene screams Godfather's 'it's not personal, just business' and reinforces how psychopathic not only Gyllenhaal is but also Nina who represents the media as a whole. 'You're just like Lou' is the true message of this film, telling the audience that what so obviously bothers us and we so easily recognize as wrong in an individual, Gyllenhaal, is also going on in the media where these same psychotic tendencies are harder for us to detect but are equally reprehensible.Gyllenhaal's performance was easily the highlight of this film and without it I think this movie loses most of its entertainment. I found the themes in this film about journalistic manipulation to be presented in a unique and clever way as well as being a refreshing message from Hollywood. This movie could have been a little faster paced as towards the end the plot began to drag a little, but I'm equally glad Gilroy resisted the urge to have some ridiculous plot twist at the end which might have compromised the integrity of the story and Gyllenhaal's character.

Gone Girl," A terrible ending to a film that otherwise had potential
","I went into this film with an enormous amount of respect for David Fincher for his directing in both Fight Club and Se7en (Panic Room and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo were also well done but nothing special). Gone Girl was quite a disappointment. There was very little to this movie other than Pike's performance that stood out as anything above mediocre. Fincher was certainly not at his best and neither was Affleck. ActingBen Affleck: At times Affleck seemed very believable as the frustrated victim of a crazy and manipulated wife. The scenes in which he comes off as untrustworthy and indifferent towards his wife, such as the speech he gives to his neighbors at the awareness event, are well done and more dynamic than what we are used to seeing from Affleck. There are other moments, however, where he comes off as painfully forced and regresses to the point where we are reminded that it's Ben Affleck we are watching, rather than Nick Dunne. The scenes at the end of the film after Pike has returned and we are supposed to feel for Nick's uncomfortable and downright scary situation, are not compelling at all. Part of this was a failure of the story to provide a practical ending, but Affleck's uninspiring performance should shoulder some of the blame.Rosamund Pike's performance in this film was, mostly, phenomenal. She played the loving wife, the scared victim and the crazy psychopath all so convincingly that it was difficult at times to tell which role was real. The only downside to her performance was that for the first half she was in very little of the film and was limited to reading from the diary. This restriction on her character was a necessity for the author Gillian Flynn (personally I think it would have been better to have just told us from the beginning that she kidnapped herself and to show her more since there was only about 30 minutes in which there existed any real doubt for the audience as to Nick's innocence) but I still would have liked to have seen more of Pike. Keeping the disappointment I felt for the story's end aside, I thought Pike's performance was a roller coaster that sloped upward and built with the film's heightening plot until it abruptly careened down a hill as the film's plot reached its conclusion. As Pike's juggling act of playing the victim and the wife gave way to one insane psychopath it reduced the significance of her range and confined her to the limitations of the story's hopelessly implausible ending.StoryAfter Nick's wife Amy goes missing, his relationship with the police is created and immediately strained to indicate they are suspicious he might be involved, a suspicion that is easily transferred to the audience. In fact from the police, Pike's diary, the news' portrayal of Affleck, and Affleck's own actions, this audience is strongly made to believe that he is guilty, which quickly turns this film into a 'who done it.' That is, until writer Gillian Flynn breaks away from this murder mystery cliché and convinces the audience of his innocence (performing the same 180 in character perception that defense attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) says he and Affleck must pull off to convince the public of his innocence.)While normally I would applaud a writer and director for taking a risk and going against a cliché for the sake of innovation, I can't help feeling that this film might have been better had it stuck to the format of a conventional murder mystery. Once the plot evolved from a 'who done it' to a clear establishment of Affleck's innocence, much of the tension that had been building in the audience's mind fizzled out. It seems that Flynn intended to replace the audience's suspense over whether or not he was guilty with concern for whether or not she would get away with her frame-up. This transition was poorly executed because it required the audience to suddenly build up feelings of sympathy for a character (Affleck) they had just spent half the movie learning to distrust. The failure to connect with or care about what happens to Affleck's character proved to be a major hindrance to the film's story. The greatest criticism I have of this film was its ending. After watching Affleck accused of murder by his neighbor, denounced by his in-laws, interrogated by the police, and almost imprisoned all on the account of a woman he now realizes has a history of falsely accusing another man of raping her, the audience is somehow expected to believe that he not only doesn't turn her in but decides to stay with her?? This resolution is so ridiculously improbable and unsatisfying that it actually undermines what good this film had to offer. What had at least been an interesting story, despite some weaknesses, loses all credibility with this preposterous conclusion. Not having read the book on which this film is based, I am forced to assume that this ending is the product of Flynn as it in no way resembles the brilliance of Fight Club or Se7en.This film teeters on the edge of being good and had a lot of potential to be a solid film, but a terrible ending and limited storyline prevent it from realizing its potential. The directing was also rather ordinary which is a disappointment for a Fincher film and Affleck seemed to digress back to his former uninspiring acting performances. Rosmund Pike is the clear star of this film but even her performance is not enough to save it.Check out more of my reviews at http://windreelandprintmoviereviews.blogspot.com/Or just search Wind Reel And Print Movie Reviews",4,1,3,15 September 2015
Jurassic World," The good, the bad, the ugly
","Directing: Who the heck is Colin Trevorrow and how did he get this job? The most glaring flaws in this movie could have been prevented had someone with more experience directing than a few shorts and one independent film been at the helm. From the incredibly painful to watch and headache inducing close-ups to the very rushed pacing of this film (especially in the first ten minutes) Trevorrow's inexperience as a director was glaringly evident. Without holding Trevorrow to the impossible standard of Steven Spielberg who has proved himself to be one of the greatest directors of all time, there was several areas where this movie proved too momentous a task for him. No failure was greater than the overabundance of close-ups which I can only assume were an attempt at creating intimacy between the audience and the characters/dinosaurs, but instead left an audience reaching for an aspirin. Worse than the headaches, however, was the effect they had on the visual presentation of the movie, especially the dinosaurs. Part of what made the first movie great was the suspense that was built by NOT SEEING THE DINOSAURS. Most who have seen Jurassic Park probably don't realize that the actual screen time of the dinosaurs is limited to only 15 minutes. What Spielberg realized with the first film is that the moments of anticipation (the puddle of water rippling, the snapping of the wired fence, the turning of the door handle from the raptor's claw) are just as exciting as actually seeing the dinosaurs. While we saw some of the this in the new movie, such as the claw marks on the wall and the realization that the Indominus Rex was still in its cage, for the most part Jurassic World relied on close-ups visuals of dinosaurs and action scenes to entertain its audience, rather than suspense. Because the audience's attention was forcibly zoomed in on so many shots, it also meant that there was a lack of grandeur that only panoramic shots such as the first introduction of the Brachiosaurus in the first film can provide. Yes people want to see dinosaurs but part of the what makes the dinosaurs appealing isn't just their destructive capabilities but also the wonder that seeing such magnificent creatures creates. I would argue the first Brachiosaurus scene in the first film is every bit as powerful as the famed scene where the T-Rex attacks the Jeeps.While a movie is the product of a team of people, it is the director who is ultimately responsible for the feel of the film and the techniques that are used to facilitate that director's style. This director seemed like he couldn't decided between whether he was making a suspense/action/thriller or a superhero movie.Special Effects: Too many close-ups meant we got to see every minute detail of CGI created dinosaurs, meaning that unlike the first film where the raptors were hidden in the shadows or used very sparingly to hide the fact that they look fake. In Jurassic World we see just how artificial looking they are as we are constantly bombarded by green-screen animation that at times looks more like a video game than real life. I could go on about this forever, but for the most part I was begrudgingly content with how much CGI was used when I consider how this movie COULD have been (ex: Episodes 1-3 of Star Wars)Story:New dinosaur is created, it escapes and wreaks havoc, ultimately it is killed. Very predictable but still enjoyable plot. I recognize that these movies aren't meant to be riddled with plot twists and for the most part the audience should know how the movie will end before it begins. Scene where they reintroduce the old park's main room: By far my favorite scene in the movie. The old banner, staircase, test tubes, jeeps, painting on the wall of the raptor, goggles, all gave me goosebumps and reminded me of how much I love the original movie. I really appreciated this scene and thought it was a great move for the makers of Jurassic World to pay tribute to the reason we are all in the audience. They tied these elements in and incorporated them into the plot seamlessly. Gyroball tour: Also a cool part of the movie and as a sucker for the herbivore scenes I thought this was an inventive and creative twist on the jeeps from the original movie. Jimmy Fallon's cameo was also entertaining and this scene was a good way to introduce the Indominous once it had escaped its paddock. Well done. Scene of Owen and Claire kissing: NO. No. NO!! When will Hollywood ever learn that NOT EVERY MOVIE NEEDS A LOVE STORY!!! I couldn't help but think of how disgusted I would be had the first film sank to the level of having Dr. Grant and Ellie kiss. To do it here was every bit as cheesy and corny as it would have been then. It also reduced Claire's role to the helpless female which is tiresome and annoying. Please, Hollywood, spare us next time.While I did my best not to judge the film with the expectation of it being like the first movie, respect and consideration for the first film is hard to separate and somewhat owed in evaluating any sequel. I thought it met my expectations and was somewhat disappointed it could not exceed them. Too much CGI, poor and inexperienced directing, and a weak secondary cast kept this movie from being great, but ultimately it was still very entertaining just being a Jurassic Park movie and I was pleasantly surprised by the main characters and some elements of the story.Check out my full review at http://windreelandprintmoviereviews.blogspot.com/Or just search Wind Reel And Print Movie Reviews",6,5,20,15 September 2015
Inception," A complex yet brilliant film for the ages
","For many, this film is synonymous with complexity—and rightfully so. Its intricate plot has more than just dreams within dreams but also ideas within ideas. There is more to Inception than just its plot twists, however. Inception is above all the most innovative idea to come out of Hollywood since Donnie Darko but is also an exhibition of fantastic cinematography, good acting, a moving score, and a compelling plot. There are too many unique elements to dreaming and inception in this story to cover them all, but a list of some of them would include: that five minutes in the real world gives an hour in the dream, the concept of architects who design dreams as mazes, that there are projections of the subconscious who can turn on those who do not belong in the dream, totems, that dreamers use bank vaults as places to hide secure information, the concept of a forger as someone who imitates real people within a dream rather than the conventional definition, etc. Because Inception has so many of these original ideas, all of which are new to the audience, much of the movie must be dedicated to explaining these concepts to the audience. How these ideas are explained and how much time is given to their explanation is critical to the film's success because there is a balance that must be met between providing enough information that the audience can understand what's going on but not so much that the audience is overwhelmed and loses interest in the story. Nolan's execution of this balance is flawless. By using multiple characters to teach the audience (Cobb, Arthur, and Eames) and dividing new concepts up between scenes, Nolan keeps his ideas fresh and manageable for the audience.'An idea is like a virus: resilient, highly contagious. The smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you.' This is how Cobb characterizes an idea and is clearly the definition at work in the film. The audience learns about the process of inception very gradually over the course of the film. We are initially told that it is a means of planting an idea into a dreamer's head and, if successful, making them believe it is their own. Then Eames makes it clear to us that this process is very difficult to master because it requires the most basic stage of the idea in order for it to work. Lastly a much darker piece of inception is introduced: that the idea can destroy the one who receives it. Nolan intentionally leaves out this information until the final confrontation between Cobb and Mal, as it is the key to understanding what happened to Mal and the reason for Cobb's guilt. Part of the Nolan's genius in this film is the way he presents the story of the inception of Fischer and the bargain with Saito to the audience as if it were the main story of the film when really he is distracting us from the real story which is Cobb's relationship with Mal.A dream within a dream and the concept of inception are the defining characteristics of Inception for most viewers but the real heart of the film is the back story of Cobb and Mal. Throughout the film we are aware that their relationship is significant since Mal works as a multifaceted bridge between the real world, the dream world, and Cobb's memories both for Cobb and for the audience. She is the real antagonist of the film as her character is constantly at work to stop Cobb from succeeding. We see her interference in the dream world from the very beginning of the film where she tells Saito about him and attempts to torture Arthur. She is Cobb's cause of pain in the real world (the reason he cannot go home to his children) and she also haunts his memories' Ariadne discovers Cobb keeps certain memories of her locked away off an elevator in his mind ('These are memories I have to make right' he tells Ariadne.) Part of the genius of this story is that at first the audience is meant to believe that Mal and Cobb's relationship is a vehicle for explaining Cobb's character and the reason he must perform inception on Fischer to be able to go home. But towards the end of the film when Cobb enters Limbo and reveals that he performed inception on Mal which led to her suicide, we begin to realize that it's the other way around; the Inception of Fischer is just the vehicle to explain what Cobb did to Mal and the reason for his guilt. Mal is the basis for the film's theme of questioning the reality we live in and the source of doubt for Cobb and for the audience as to whether Cobb lives in the real world or whether he is still dreaming while his children keep him grounded in the real world.A film to be watched again and again, Inception is a thought-provoking, mind-bending film for the ages. Its complexity is not limited to its story, but extends to its cinematography, and its score. This film takes special effects, which are sometimes the downfall of a film, and uses it as a strength to build on an already creative script. In today's age of movies where three sequels to Avatar are being made and Hollywood is often criticized for its lack of imagination, Inception is the creativity we've all been searching for.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A vast improvement to the sequels and a promising foundation for the next two films in the series.
","The Force Awakens provided an opportunity for me and for all Star Wars fans: a chance at redemption for a series that more recently left a bad taste in our mouths. Like most Star Wars fans I accepted that it could not live up to the originals, but went in begging for it to be better than the prequels; the result was somewhere in the middle. Characters/ ActingRey (Daisey Ridley): Daisy Ridley's performance turned out to be one of the highlights of the film for me and yet another example of how effective a strong female character can be on the big screen. Rey is an interesting character because of all the complex issues surrounding her: her desire to know and be reunited with her family, her admiration for Han Solo who she looks up to as a clearly capable and like-wise to scale the innards of fallen star destroyers for equipment which she sells for food to survive. Rey is an interesting character because of all the complex issues surrounding her: her desire to know and be e tough individual, her struggles to understand her relationship with the force while at the same time wishing she could reject her greater role. In many ways her character is far superior to that of Luke in A New Hope, who I have always found a bit bland and somewhat whiny, if only because she is playing the roles of Luke and Han Solo simultaneously. Ridley performance reveals a spectrum of toughness, compassion, and wit that has me looking forward to her next role.Finn (John Boyega): I cannot blame him for some of the terrible lines he was given in the film such as 'Hell of a pilot' which were not only cheesy but were often unnatural to the context of his situation, but I can fault him for his delivery of these lines as well as many others. His facial expressions, his speech, and sometimes his lack of engagement when other characters were acting left me disappointed in his performance. While going into the film I was interested in getting to know Finn's character, by the end I was asking myself repeatedly 'why is his character necessary to this film?' The more I consider Finn's character the more I wonder whether the filmmakers themselves knew what to do with his character. Like Rey, Finn tries to serve many functions at once: he is the C-3PO comic relief, the love/friend interest of Rey, the side of Solo that doesn't want to be a hero but just wants to run, and sometimes he is the hero or at least makes an effort to be. Unlike Rey's character though which is strengthened by all these complex characteristics which mesh well together, Finn's is pulled in many different directions that glaringly contradict. How is the audience supposed to reconcile the fact that sometimes he is the haphazard, comic relief often in need of rescue himself, such as when he is carried off by the creature in the ship and saved by Rey, while at other moments he is trying to be the hero and go into the Death Star to rescue Rey (only to actually contribute nothing to her rescue). While there are functions that he serves as far as advancing the plot, the melting-pot of personal traits given to Finn did not blend well and was not aided by the mediocre to sub-par acting skills of John Boyega. Story/ WritingAs much as I would rather not compare Star Wars: The Force Awakens to Star Wars: A New Hope, the fact that this film is in many ways a retelling of the first Star Wars film requires me to do so. From the droid which escapes an imperial force with data critical to the rebellion right up to the destruction of yet another Death Star, this film is littered with not just references but borrowed ideas from the original. Even the characters themselves are in many ways an obvious recycling of the past: Luke is Yoda the wise teacher who has gone into solitude and must be sought out for training, Han is Obi-Wan the wise, old guide who is there to provide direction for the characters until they become self-reliant at which point he is killed by Kylo-Ren who in turn takes the place of Vader the ambitious former Jedi struggling with the inner turmoil between good and evil. The parallels are not subtly introduced but are readily apparent from each character's introduction.I am conflicted by how to react to Abram's decision to make the film so much like A New Hope. On the one hand it makes the film very predictable. For example, once you realize that the film is essentially A New Hope you can begin searching for each character's equivalent and plugging them into the storyline; for example, once it became clear to me that Han was Obi-Wan, in my mind his fate was sealed. But then again I am conflicted because this is Star Wars not Inception or The Usual Suspects; we don't see Star Wars for its intricate plot. Return of the Jedi proved to us that we could see the same old story and still love it because it's Star Wars (just so long as it actually had a plot, and acting, and characters we cared about, unlike 3 movies which are undeserving of the title of Star WarsÂ…) Abram's intent, much like the newer Star Trek movies, was to give us the nostalgia we have been craving so badly and in this he succeeded. So while some will bemoan that another Death Star was destroyed or that the plot was predictable, this is an instance where that's fine by me.Conclusion: A vast improvement to the sequels and a promising foundation for the next two films in the series.",7,3,11,18 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," A revolutionary new take on action films
","The film may be called Mad Max and it may start and end with him, but anyone watching soon realizes that Mad Max is actually about her with Max providing the vehicle (no pun intended) for her story. It is she who is trying to free the birth mothers and take them to 'the green place,' her story of redemption for past sins as much as Max's redemption, and she who the film's villain, Imortan Joe, is trying to kill (in fact Joe never so much as acknowledges Max's existence at any point during the film.) Charlize Theron's performance is a refreshing defiance of the typical female role of helpless love interest and shows that a strong female lead playing an emotionally scarred, physically tough character can be just as believable as male actors. This film, and Charlize Theron in particular, left me wondering why more films don't have stories written for strong, independent women if characters like Furiosa are the result we can expect. Max (Tom Hardy): Where the character of Furiosa wore her emotions on her sleeve, the audience had a much more difficult time discerning what Max was feeling or thinking due to his extremely limited dialogue and his largely quite demeanor. Hardy's performance was subtlety at its finest. Since his dialogue was so limited he could not act through his words, as most roles do, so instead he used his eyes and his body language to convey his character's inner turmoil. The jittery manner in which Hardy moves throughout the film is one example of how he effectively demonstrates Max's borderline insanity without speaking, another being the way his eyes are constantly shifting back and forth in his head. The director George Miller should be applauded for his decision to use as little CGI as possible (only about 10% of the film is CGI) in order to make the film appear and feel as realistic as possible (the flames shooting out of the guitar are in fact real). Using the Australian landscape combined with enhanced color filters to make the film as vibrant as possible, Miller was able to achieve his goal of creating a uniquely colorful post-apocalyptic world; this was a conscious effort by Miller to prevent the audience from feelings of bleakness and destitution. This method was simple yet also highly effective.Another area where Miller imprints his directional style is his transitions throughout the film. There are several moments in the story where there is a shift in the story's pacing, usually from a high action sequence to a much slower one, and a lesser director might have struggled with these transitions appearing choppy. Instead, Miller uses scenes like these to further enhance the audience's feeling that they are not only watching a car chase, but they are experiencing it. One example is the scene where we see the flare in the desert after storm slowly dim and fade to darkness as the music builds and then suddenly the scene switches to bright morning sunlight with bright sand and a very slowly rising Max. This quick shift from high speed to an abrupt halt is not unlike suddenly braking in a car and gives the film greater depth in a very subtle way. Another example of this technique is that right after Max is caught while trying to escape being branded and has been shown at a higher film rate, he is thrust back inside the cave and we are immediately shown the brand on Furiosa's neck. In addition to creating a car-like transition, this also serves as a way of introducing Furiosa and immediately creates a connection in the audience's mind between her and Max.George Miller and his co-writers also strengthened this film's story by avoiding the temptation to fall into overdone and tiresome clichÃ©s. Having the intestinal fortitude as a storyteller to kill off Nux, a young boy who the audience grows to like and sympathize with, rather than sparing him to preserve a happy ending, was a bold and commendable decision. The greatest trap, however, that Miller avoided, was the temptation to have Max and Furiosa form a romantic relationship by having Max kiss her when she was on the verge of death. Not only would this have weakened her character significantly and turned her into yet another damsel, it would have shattered the bond they had formed over their shared desire to achieve redemption. Sometimes it is not what directors and screenwriters do that makes their stories successful, it is what they choose not to do.Another significant part of what made this movie interesting and unique was the many creative concepts that Miller brought to this post- apocalyptic world. The types of War Boy warriors: pole cats, flamers, war rigs, etc. as well as the many different car designs, especially the rocker vehicle, gave the audience something to look at as well as making the film less like a typical car chase. The concept of Mad Max being a universal donor and used as a blood bag, which ends up saving Furiosa, was also very clever. At the heart of the story is the concept of the War Boys being half-lives who are trying to reach Valhalla while also worshiping V-8 engines; this along with the idea of 'witnessing' with chrome and being reincarnated shiny and chrome like cars is a very creative concept of a fictional religious cult.Mad Max: Fury Road is a revolutionary new action film which incorporates strong female characters and a unique story in addition to breathtaking visuals. These visuals are not overdone and neither is the story. This film is fast paced and action packed, yet somehow also makes great use of subtlety through Miller's directing and Hardy's acting. Charlize Theron's performance is incredible, particularly in the still limited genre of an action film, but even more impressive than her acting is the creativity and skill that director/writer/producer George Miller brought to this film.",10,0,7,15 September 2015
Donnie Darko," Donnie Darko: Explained
","Apart from Donnie there are several other actors whose roles serve two overall functions: the foils or 'bullshitters,' as Mr. Darko calls them, whose narrow minded perspective on life provides a contrast to Donnie's and the enablers who engage with Donnie's view on reality and help him try to understand the truth. His sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal, serves as the overbearing but good hearted older sister who brings out the rebellious teen in Donnie. Other foils include his gym teacher Kitty and Jim Cunningham both of whom preach his cult's view of fear and happiness. Both of these characters show us the frustration building inside Donnie as they present oversimplified explanations and solutions of life's problems which Donnie knows to be insufficient: 'The world isn't black and white,' he tells Kitty.In addition to these 'bullshitters' there are those characters who aid Donnie in his quest for the truth: his therapist, Grandma Death, his English teacher, and his science teacher. These characters are of far greater significance to the film as in addition to showing us the depth of Donnie's character they are what progress the story. These 'manipulated living,' as they are referred to in chapter 7 of the film, are portals of information for Donnie which drive him closer to enlightenment and ultimately help him to make a decision about his fate. In order to reset the universe to its original course Donnie requires the insight provided by these characters who function as Deus Ex Machina 'God from machine' by providing the necessary resolution to the seemingly unsolvable problem of a collapsing space-time continuum.WritingDonnie Darko succeeds because all of the major themes in it, even those that are very different from each other, all tie into one theme: Donnie is meant to die.The first major theme is introduced in Donnie's English class where he discovers that destruction can be a form of creation in a story where children flood a school. Once this idea is planted in Donnie's head we see him act on this knowledge as he floods the school, defaces the school's mascot, and eventually burns down Cunningham's house. This is the first time Donnie is given information from a Deus Ex Machina (in this case his English teacher) and then given a task which is meant to compel him to choose to end his life and restore order to the universe. By flooding the school and burning down Cunningham's house he willingly commits acts for which Donnie knows he is likely to suffer great consequences: 'I only have a few days left before they catch me' he tells his therapist. Yet ironically it is not fear which motivates Donnie to do these things, which Cunningham claims motivates Donnie, but loyalty to Frank who saved his life and, more importantly, a desire to 'know his master plan' (Whether 'his' refers to Frank or to God is never made clear in the film and whether it is one or the other is irrelevant since what the film is primarily focused on is Donnie's figuring out that he must choose to die.) The audience is meant to understand that while the fear of being caught hangs over Donnie, pushing him away from any attachment toward this tangent universe, it is the search for knowledge that drives him.There are several other themes raised in the film that also point Donnie towards his death. Time travel is of course a significant part of the film and while it is certainly used to make the film more complex and therefore interesting, its ultimate purpose is to make it possible for Donnie to change the past and die as he was originally supposed to (another example of Deus Ex Machina.) The acceptance of one's fate and that we all die alone is a subtler but equally important theme that pops up several times in the film including towards the beginning of the film when Grandma Death tells Donnie that 'Every living creature on Earth dies alone.' This is another example of how a theme which seems to stand on its own is really just a vehicle for getting Donnie to accept death so that he can more easily make the decision to save the universe. Death itself also serves as an important motivator as the one person Donnie loves, Gretchen, is killed by Frank's car as a result of Grandma Death standing in the street (not coincidentally, right after Donnie cries out 'Deus Ex Machina.') Gretchen's death proves to be the most significant motivator for Donnie. The morning after Gretchen's death, we see Donnie return home. Though Donnie is faced with plenty of reasons for not being invested in this tangent universe (those mentioned above as well as for murdering Frank) he still tries to flee from his fate by driving away with Gretchen's body after he sees the cloud formation in the sky which he knows will bring about his death. Sitting on a hilltop overlooking the valley below, the film reaches its climax as Donnie is finally faced the decision of whether or not to sacrifice himself for the universe. Donnie gets back into the car, takes a long look at Gretchen's body and realizes that the only way to save her is for him to die. Following his decision the screen immediately flashes the word 'purge,' signaling an end to the tangent universe and a restoration of order. Ultimately Donnie was not motivated by fear as Cunningham alleged, but by his love for Gretchen.The complexity of this story and its many themes all working towards one beautiful resolution is what makes this film such a masterpiece. Kelly's genius is demonstrated by his ability to take longstanding clichés like the story of a troubled teen, young love, and an overbearing school and effectively combine them with as complex a concept as time travel.Check out my full review at http://windreelandprintmoviereviews.blogspot.com/Or search Wind Reel And Print Movie Reviews",10,0,2,15 September 2015
