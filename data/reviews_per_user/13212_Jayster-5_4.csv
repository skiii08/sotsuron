The Blair Witch Project," An utter piece of overhyped trash!
","'The Scariest Movie I've Ever Seen(???)' Are you people serious!?  I guess I wasn't let in on the joke because this film was absolutely terrible! There were (and still are) a lot of stupid and gullible people out there who were suckered in by this turkey.  I can't believe so many people think this pseudo-documentary was authentic.  It's fiction, and it isn't even GOOD fiction.  What the hell is so scary about three stoned film students wandering around a forest?  I'm a horror movie buff, and after all the hooplah surrounding the Blair Witch Project I bought myself a copy when it was released on home video.  I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, and after viewing the tape only once I promptly ejected it from my VCR, set it on the floor, and stomped the cassette into pieces!  I WAS RIPPED OFF!! WHAT WAS THAT CRAP!!  Scary? What? Are you people all retarded??!!  There is absolutely nothing redeeming about Blair Witch, nothing!  It's isn't even worth another viewing for it's camp value, because it isn't even campy! Just what, may I ask, was so damn scary about it?  Was it the terrible camera work, the absence of logic?  The feeling of confusion and nausea? Was it the narcotic-induced panic of the 3 imbiscilic film students?  This is quite simply THE WORST movie I have EVER seen in my life!  Stay away, stay far away!",1,3,6,22 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Biggest Turkey Ever!
","I couldn't wait to see this movie, I was salivating over the commercials and trailers, I was giddy as I sat in my seat waiting for it to begin and then it did and I couldn't believe what I was seeing... it was HORRIBLE!!! This has got to be the worst movie I've seen at the theater in years. What's with all of these Star Wars marks? They all write things like 'It's got flaws but so what' and 'It's not meant to be great cinema' or 'It was great except for all the stupid parts!' Jar Jar Binks was the worst character in any movie ever! The 'bad guy' trade federation guys had cheesy Chinese accents! What good is dialogue if you can't understand two words? Those CGI scenes were atrocious. I can watch the old Star Wars movies all day but I will never sit through this turkey again, it stinks no matter what you Star Wars freaks say.",1,3,6,26 May 1999
Scary Movie 2," Not terrible, just not very funny.
","Let me preface this review by saying that I LOVE scary movies, and bad horror is an artform all it's own. Watching a bad horror film can be rewarding, but Scary Movie 2 is not a horror film, it's a comedy, and bad comedy is not an artform. There aren't too many websites dedicated to unfunny comedies, as there are for bad/silly/cheesy/campy horror flicks. I did not hate SM2, it was a fine date movie, but as with the prequel the 'satire' breaks down into an endless stream of toilet jokes. Toilet jokes can be funny, as they occasionally are here, but to rely almost solely on them in a film that presents itself as a SATIRE is wrong. I have the same gripes with SM2 as I did with the first one. Not enough genuinly smart jokes. Most are just gross-out style. With so much to parody in the realm of horror it's sad to see the comedy ball dropped so often. An over reliance on swearing and bodily fluids really detract from the actual satire. At least this one went away from the 'Scream' style movies that it rheemed in the SM1. This one is more like The Haunting, with a little Excorcist and What Lies Beneath thrown in. I have to say this much, Cindy had me hypnotised, she's so beautifull I just wanted the movie to focus solely on her and never leave. Chris Elliot is also quite funny as the grotesque and gimpy caretaker, he steals most of his scenes. The clown under the bed scared my girlfriend, so it scores points for that. Tim Curry is fat; Tori Spelling is ugly; Cindy is hypnotic; the chick with the leather pants and visable thong should do Playboy; Chris Elliot rules; Drug/Penis jokes get old fast; that's what Andy Richter's been doing? James Woods has no shame. TWO and 1/2 STARS out of four.",3,1,2,5 July 2001
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Shocking Cerebral Scarefest!
","Wes Craven is a genius! What else can you call a man who could conceive this twisted and macabre ghost story about a claw-handed killer who haunts your dreams? Craven tapped into mankind's collective fear of the unknown and helplessness when he unleashed Freddy Krueger upon Hollywood in the mid 1980's. This film is very scary and extremely effective, not to mention gory as all hell and way more intelligent than any horror film before it. What would you do if you knew that an evil man was going to murder you when you fall asleep, and knowing that we all must inevitably sleep, we have no choice. What if you saw your friends dispatched one-by-one by the mad man only to have nobody believe you? What if you realized that unless you confront your fear and face the monster that he will not only kill you, but every child in your sleepy town. What if you were Nancy? Watch this movie and experience the terror for yourself!",10,0,0,10 May 1999
