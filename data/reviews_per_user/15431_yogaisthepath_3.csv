First Man," Perfect
","Its a flawless film and anyone who doesn't think so needs to kick rocks. Every aspect was amazing. Acting, script, cinematography, the score...the detail in the scenes and effort to make it look classic was awe inspiring. Truly remarkable film. As if it actually happened and you are there to live through it.",10,0,3,28 April 2019
A Star Is Born," Waiting for the bass to drop and it never happens
",Save your time and go watch the Whitney documentary instead. Nothing special about this movie that didnt already exist outside of this movie. Want to hear gag sing go watch her music videos. Want to see Cooper act go watch one of his better movies. Incredibly dissapoonting.,1,2,7,7 February 2019
Parasite," Predictable and poorly executed.
",Stunned at how anyone would think highly of this film. It should have been a short. Every aspect of the story line was so predictable and poorly executed. Not even a single spin that could have made it interesting. Do not pay to see this movie. Stream for free or just don't even watch it.,1,7,16,9 March 2020
