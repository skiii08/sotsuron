The Lobster," overlong arty farty drivel fest
","The film had nice direction with all the long shots and weird camera angles that tell you straight away , hey this is an art film. I think the point of the film is to make you think and i did but.... the nearly 2 hours of metaphor bore snore had me thinking 'oh no , I've done it again and wasted precious minutes on an unrewarding experiment.Lots of times in the film i found myself saying 'no way ,that wouldn't happen' , and of course the producer writer would say , 'well thats the point of the movie' , it's metaphorical'...... ah! so thats how to get away with making a movie this bad.Its been labelled a comedy, romance, sci fi! There was no real science or comedy, i laughed once.I drew my own conclusions to the meanings of the title but i wont bore you with the details as it's simply not worth the time.In a few words.... Human conditioning , how we do things to fit in with other people, how we do thing people ask without question and the struggles we go through to find love. Don't waste time on this , Don't be fooled by the genre's, its absolutely misleading , the genre should be modern fart.1 star for film work , a waste of good actors and money!",1,62,109,15 December 2015
