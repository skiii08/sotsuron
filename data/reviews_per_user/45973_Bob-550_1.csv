Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This film actually lives up to the hype!
","I was very surprised when I saw this film, because I was under the impression George Lucas had no real interest in the stories anymore. Of the original three Star Wars films, The Return of the Jedi was, to me a very unsatisfying conclusion to the trilogy. I didn't think the Ewoks were much fun, and I much preferred the darkness of episodes IV and V. Jedi seemed like a tired addition to these.Having avoided the media hype, I viewed the film with a fairly open mind, and was surprised at the complex story, truly special effects, and good acting (No Macaulay Culkin types here). The action set-pieces were all imaginitively executed, and unlike episodes IV and VI, there were no lulls in the story either.There was even scope for a few surprises in the story, which were certainly unforseen.Ignore the critics (who ARE these people? - what movies have they made?), just enjoy this great movie.Only people actually expecting a shallow cash-in will be disappointed.",Null,0,0,26 July 1999
