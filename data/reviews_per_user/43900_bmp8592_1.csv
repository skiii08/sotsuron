Miracle," uplifting, inspiring, and loved
","this movie is so much more than just a sports movie. it deals with the issues of the cold war and communism. it also shows how the country was helped by the seemingly impossible win against the soviets. the casting is perfect, down to the regional accents. the hockey scenes are absolutely unbelievable, and the hockey players turned actors are wonderful. Jim Craig, Jack O'Callahan, and MIke Eruzione each display a touching story that follows them through their struggles on the 1980 hockey team. Kurt Russell's acting is so fierce, that I almost couldn't tell the difference between him and the real Herb Brooks at the end. Although some scenes are absolutely heart-wrenching, the movie as a whole is absolutely inspiring. And it helps that the young hockey boys are easy on the eyes.",10,2,3,29 January 2007
