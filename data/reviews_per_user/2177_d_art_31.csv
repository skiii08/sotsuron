Sucker Punch," 'Sucker Punch' packs just enough punch.
","In Sucker Punch, Emily Browning plays Baby Doll, a young girl who is locked away in a mental asylum by her abusive stepfather where she is scheduled to undergo lobotomy in five days. While there, her mind retreats into a semi-fantasy world where she and four female inmates are plotting to escape the facility. She then retreats to a deeper fantasy world, where she is fighting samurais, robotic soldiers, and dragons with her four friends. There, she is told about the five items that she needs to find in the facility that will help her escape from the asylum.The film starts off stylistically surreal. The muted colors and sharp contrasts convey a nightmarish reality that flows without words, much like a music video. With sharp attention to detail, close-ups, and a moody cover of Sweet Dreams (that Annie Lennox made famous) in the background, the scenes that unfold are implied more than spelt out. Within five minutes of the film, Baby Doll winds up in the asylum, falsely accused of murdering her sister and then attacking her stepfather. As she enters the theater section of the asylum, the room is morphed into a night club / bordello, where the orderlies are now formally-dressed night club operators. Here, she befriends Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung) who are stuck there as late night entertainers. Every so often, when Baby Doll is forced to do a dance for a client or an audience, she retreats to yet another fantasy world (think Inception, like a dream within a dream) where she is given a different mission each time to battle samurai robots and other nefarious baddies with her four friends.While fighting in this alternate world, these characters wear what would be considered fetish fashion—they are in military, leather, and school girl outfits. While one can argue that these clothes are simply what comic book heroines wear, it is perhaps more of an allusion to the fact that the four characters are, in reality, prostitutes inside the facility. Many of the fantastic scenes appear to be metaphors, giving some clue of what could be happening outside the fantasy world. AdvertisementEmily Browning and the female crew do a great job looking cool while shootings guns, doing crazy jumps, and swinging swords. There is no doubt that director Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen) can direct effectively choreographed fighting scenes. There are lots of it and tons of explosions and hails of bullets. This world uses video game physics, with nods to anime and sci-fi / fantasy / geek culture. To a casual viewer, however, this will seem like a waste of time, an overt focus on style over substance (and it is rather true). While these action scenes are impressive to look at, they are almost entirely computer-generated, and given that this is a fantasy world, any tension of being in actual danger is minimized (a similar issue I had with Inception). With that said, this film does quite well in the action scenes. The visuals are amazing. It's a pity there's more beauty than tension. As for the plot itself, it isn't too complex. Admittedly, this film could have been a strong psychological thriller had the focus on style and pop culture was less pronounced and at least less modern. One assumes this film takes place around the 50's (or earlier), but many of the fantasy action scenes have a modern sensibility in fashion, guns, and mechs. Given that this is all part of Baby Doll's fantasy, one wonders if she may have been playing video games, watching anime, and reading modern sci-fi books. Nevertheless, this film packs enough punch where it counts. If you want updates on more of my reviews, you can find them on http://twitter.com/d_art",8,2,7,1 April 2011
Source Code," 'Source Code' is a unique, entertaining thrill ride
","This film is a sci-fi geek's dream-- a cross between Quantum Leap, Groundhog Day, and possibly a computer adventure game. The film starts off like an episode of Quantum Leap. The main character is Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who wakes up inside a commuter train, with an attractive girl in front of him, who already apparently likes him (perfect!). He looks in the mirror and finds out that he is someone else, at least to everyone else around him. He realizes too late that the train he is on has been set to explode in 8 minutes, which happens. He wakes up inside a pod of some sort, a part of a government experiment in which he can travel to the past, into the consciousness of a passenger's last 8 minutes of his life (multiple times). His mission was to find out who had caused that explosion, so the culprit can be located (in the present) before he bombs another train or building. To add, Colter can go to the past, but he can't change it to affect the present. The film goes on to explain all this with jibber jabber about parallel universes and its link to the last 8 minutes of a memory of a deceased passenger. Colter can enter into this new reality and interact with things that the passenger hadn't experienced—because it's actually a parallel universe, you see? (Say what?). Thankfully, the film doesn't try to explain this in great detail.Now, once you can run with this idea, it's an extremely entertaining movie. Like Groundhog Day, death isn't a factor for Gyllenhaal's character because he will merely return back to the pod after 8 minutes. I'm partly reminded of the text adventure games I used to play when I was a kid--you'd die and you'd return to a saved point, where you can try a different route in the story. In essence, you don't even have to really focus on the mission. In each scenario, Colter would try different things to find the bomber, but on the side he proceeds to find out more about himself, of which he has only fuzzy memories of. Given 8 minutes each time, the pacing of this film is relentless. Understandably, it's not a heavily character-driven film, aside from Jake Gyllenhaal's character. The whole train motif, the confused protagonist, and pastel colors bring back a bit of Hitchcock. The pacing is consistent and the twists keep coming.The suspense in the film works mainly because we care about Jake Gyllenhaal's character. Gyllenhaal is a great everyman. He reacts just as one would expect in such extreme circumstances. He struggles with his own desires, duty, and with his rights which are being infringed upon. Michelle Monaghan does well enough as Colter's potential love interest, Christina—understandably, due to time constraints of the situations, she is not complex. How many meaningful conversations ever stayed within 8 minutes, after all? Likewise, the government agents who are heading the experiment, as played by Jeffrey Wright and Vera Farmiga, feel mostly like archetypes.Overall, this is a fun, entertaining thriller with many potential threads. Like Inception, as Hollywood films go, this is a unique film. The ideas aren't new, but it takes a fresh approach. The 8-minute gimmick forces the story to waste little time. Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal brings in the emotion and Duncan Jones' taut direction pulls out the suspense. Because there are so many ways one can go with this material, this could have been a pretty good ongoing TV series like Lost. If not, I imagine straight-to-video sequels coming soon.For more of my movie reviews, you can find them through twitter.com/d_art",9,0,1,10 April 2011
50 First Dates," not much of a comedy, but quite sentimental
","The story follows a guy who is trying to win the heart of this one girl, who actually likes him back, except there's a twist -- she happens to have a short-term memory loss and thus, forgets everything that happened the day before.  I'm not particularly an Adam Sandler fan nor am I particularly anti-Adam Sandler.   I do, however, like well-done, funny films, and much of the low-brow comedy that is out there usually falls flat.  This movie, in that area, was no exception.  I often found myself nearly falling asleep at the jokes (I was also a little tired, admittedly, but good jokes usually keep me awake).  That is unfortunate too, since beyond the unfunny potty humor, the film is actually quite sweet and smart enough in the romantic areas.  It is also endearing to see a story where a guy tries over and over to restart a relationship (literally) that seems very hopeless.  Like the last good Sandler film, 'The Wedding Singer,' the two leads, Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler, have good chemistry.  If this film had decided to drop the usual cheap humor, or heck, had just been a PG film, they may actually have had to resort to 'wit' to make the film funny.  Now, that would've been something creative and perhaps this movie could've been the next 'Groundhog Day' even.  As it is, it is like a good lollipop covered with really cheap ketchup.  5/10",Null,0,0,17 February 2004
Resident Evil: Afterlife," 'Resident Evil: Afterlife 3-D' has good 3-D, less everything else
","Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the latest, and fourth of the Resident Evil series, now called Afterlife, Alice (Milla Jovovich) continues on her journey, now with her sidekick Claire (Ali Larter), in a world ravaged by a virus infection to find survivors in L.A. and lead them to safety. Meanwhile the evil Umbrella Corporation responsible for the virus is after her.This 3rd sequel has now went on to the Avatar-esque RealD 3-D format, and in all honesty, it looked amazing. The images were crisp, the whites looked white, and the raindrops Oh my, the raindrops. If you had a choice between watching it in 3-D or 2-D, I'd suggest the 3-D version, because, well, the movie itself doesn't fair as well on its own, meaning, in terms of characterization, plot, or even action.The film starts off strong, particularly the beginning credits, which presents a rainy Tokyo street scene where a girl is standing alone without an umbrella amongst a crowd. The scene is filled with colors, tension, and mystery. Had the film carried that same sense of horror throughout the film, I think this film could've been something quite special. The pacing slows down considerably as well. As it is, it is a fairly standard action film with Milla Jovovich doing her usual badass, too-tough-to-bother action heroine thing. She looks cool, no doubt—but it's nothing new and she's mostly going through the motions by now.The visuals are what sells this film. The sets, both virtual and not, are of high quality (and budget, too, I suppose). The storming of the Umbrella corporation in the beginning is quite out there, but kind of neat, too. A fight between two women vs. one baddie with a giant ax is a nice scene where you see 3-D blood splatter onto the screen. Personally, I don't see how the film could be better in 2-D, particularly these action scenes. These scenes are highly unrealistic, are often in slow motion, and not terribly exciting aside from the 3-D. They're great visuals, but there's hardly any tension, drama, or fear. Milla Jovovich's Alice has become a James Bond-ian superwoman where no bullets or sharp edges can touch her. She twirls and jumps in mid-air, easily dodging bullets as if they were tennis balls on American Gladiators. Advertisement And, this is all in slo-mo. Now, this is where 3-D gets useful. You can appreciate the details, the textures, and the spatial awareness. I've read in an article recently that one of the tough aspects about filming fight scenes in a 3-D film is that you have to actually connect, or hit the other person because you can't use fake distance with camera tricks like you can with the regular film. I suppose that could be the reason for the use of slo-mo. Then again, one can always do the other way as in some Hong Kong Films, where they 'undercrank,' so people can fight slower with slower frame rate so it looks faster in normal speed. Either way, it works aesthetically well in 3-D. Motion blurs could look odd in 3-D, after all.The plot involves a group of survivors stranded on a prison facility surrounded by flesh-eating zombies. It is up to Alice and Claire to help them get to safety to a ship offshore. The characters are fairly generic, with couple of fighter-type guys, a wimpy guy, a sleazy guy, and a pretty chick. Their backstory doesn't figure much into the plot, so it doesn't really matter what they do.Milla Jovovich has played this type of role for so long that it's nothing surprising. She plays Alice with great physicality and delivers her lines as it is written. The dialogue is generic, lacking humor. Ali Larter plays Claire, who looks more like a feminine version of Alice. Shawn Roberts plays the evil head of the Umbrella Corporation, Albert Wesker. (Who pays for the Umbrella Corporation, by the way? And, do they still pay money?) Wesker resembles Ice Man from Top Gun, donning sunglasses, looking robotic--I suppose he symbolizes the cold, robotic nature of big corporations.Overall, despite the simple plot and characters, Milla plays Alice as I suppose she is meant to played, with lots of action. I was still happy how good the 3-D looked and it could be a good reason to at least check it out in theaters. There's good potential and effective use of this medium, if coupled with a good script and characters we can care about.",6,0,2,1 April 2011
It," A solid horror film with bite
","This past weekend, I saw the movie 'It' (2017), directed by Andy Muschietti ('Mama'), based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King. First off, let me say that I enjoyed this movie quite a bit-- it was a highly entertaining monster flick with jump scares that surprisingly worked (which usually doesn't in many films). The movie stars various (mostly unknown) child actors and Bill Skarsgård as an evil entity called Pennywise the Dancing Clown, which terrorizes the town of Derry every 27 years. The main protagonist of this film is the stuttering Bill (Jaesen Lieberher), who wants to avenge his little brother who was killed by Pennywise. The film focuses mostly on the kids and their relationships, their school bullies, dysfunctional adults, and the sharp-toothed killer clown that moves around in the sewers.I have the novel in my house, which I never got around to reading. I did, however, see the miniseries on TV, also called 'It' (1990), starring Tim Curry as the titular killer clown. There were two parts to the miniseries--first half took place in 1960, and the second part in 1990. The first half mainly starred children, while the second half starred adults (the same children now grown up). The TV show was fairly creepy for TV (particularly the first half), while the second half was on the cheesier side, with monster effects that were not quite on par with theatrical films of that time. Tim Curry ('Clue') was an effectively creepy clown, given that he often just popped out of nowhere to harass the kids. The second half wasn't helped by the fact that it starred mostly comedians such as Harry Anderson ('Night Court'), John Masur ('License to Drive') and John Ritter ('Three's Company)--a baffling decision by the producers. Just imagine seeing a horror film starring Jerry Seinfeld, Adam Sandler, and Larry the Cable Guy, and you get the idea. So, this 2017 film fixes a lot of the problems that the miniseries had. This film only tells the first half of the story (which still works as a standalone story), with only the children as the protagonists. It also takes place in 1989, taking cues from the nostalgic, retro look and style of Netflix's popular 'Stranger Things.' (To note, one of the kids from the show is in this movie). Unlike the miniseries, the creature effects in this film is impressively creepy and artistically done. And, this movie is rated R (also quite unusual for horror movies of this ilk), which pretty much tells you that they aren't messing around.Bill Skarsgård is excellent as Pennywise. He is going full-on creepy-monster-mode here. This is to Tim Curry's Pennywise what Heath Ledger's Joker was to Jack Nicholson's. This Pennywise isn't interested in dishing out any humor or making puns--he is meant to be terrible and scary. With that said, Skarsgård's acting has just enough subtlety and the inflections of his voice to be original and interesting. The kids' acting are pretty top-notch. They feel like real kids, and their situation is often quite terrible. Adults are unlikable here for the most part, and are often one-dimensional. Maybe it's me, but I feel this quite often in Stephen King films (eg. 'Carrie') where teens or kids are protagonists--all adults seem like terrible people. The plot isn't particularly complex--much of the story is about the characters and the horror they face. Where it lacks in story, it has enough details about the characters that you care about their well-being (something many horror films fail at). There is plenty of humor in this film which thankfully offsets some of the gloominess of the situation. Much of this humor comes from the 80's references to films and music, and kids' sarcastic, bad-mouthed dialogue. Having been a child of the 80's myself, I found much to relate here. As for the horror, as I mentioned, there is, yes, plenty of jump scares. However, this film isn't focused on the 'JUMP' part of the 'jump scare' but focuses on the 'SCARE' part of the jump scare. Allow me to explain. Usually, in horror films, right when a 'jump scare' comes, it's very quiet at first, then there's a loud noise (which is usually the part that scares you the most) and something 'horrific' (or at least not quite as horrific as the loud noise) happens, then ends (usually quickly). In this movie, the horrific part lingers--you get a good look at what is supposed to scare you. The result feels earned, and not cheap. Remember back in the day when seeing a cool, creepy creature was the big payoff? It was the type of thing that many categorized as a well-done popcorn horror flick. The special effects are also quite good here, many of them practical. As the miniseries failed with its lackluster special effects, this film succeeds. Without giving away details, they did well with the budget. Director Andy Muschietti has made a solid horror film.If there are any complaints, I kind of feel that it has more to do with Stephen King's original story. The illusory part of how Pennywise operates in the world never seemed quite clear to me. This was also how I felt when I saw the miniseries. Maybe it's better explained in the book--the film is a bit vague on it. And, the adults, as mentioned, are mostly stereotypes--I'm not saying that's not allowed, but such things can make the world feel less real. This is an entertaining horror film. The female audiences at my theater jumped and screamed in horror more than a few times, while laughing afterwards. If they weren't entertained, at least I was entertained by their reaction. Many also chuckled at the 'New Kids on the Block' jokes--yep, we get it, sirs. Well played, dear fellows. Well played.My Rating: **** 1/2 out of ***** starsReview at http://ninjasonmotorcycles.blogspot.com/2017/09/my-movie- review-it-2017.html",9,6,13,11 September 2017
Star Trek," Movie Thoughts: The New Star Trek
","And so, I watched the new Star Trek flick directed by JJ Abrams on Friday morning for $6 (since it was before noon at AMC) with some buddies. It was massively entertaining and I liked it just like everybody else who came with me, although I did have one major nitpick about it (although those who see it will probably know exactly what I mean... but I understand fully why they did that). Definitely, worth watching again. The casting and the acting was excellent. I loved the little fanboy elements, small little details that elevated my appreciation of it, and the visuals are colorful, optimistic, while being mature in its execution. Despite the fact that I was more on the Star Wars side of the Trekkie-Jedi spectrum (at least before the prequels), I did love the old Star Trek series. Cool thing about Star Trek was that although they explored new worlds 'physically,' in reality it was more of an inner journey that was projected as physical manifestations (just like the great Twilight Zone series), which made you think a little bit more. It also made the cheesy f/x charming, because those things became irrelevant. And, Captain Kirk, what a character! Spock, what a square! (in a good way) Mc Coy was a like a grumpy, emotional grandma, but a ton of fun! Admittedly, much of the movies that came out of it were more about the dogfights than exploring, however. Despite the fact that people do make fun of the first motion picture, I appreciated it simply for the fact that they actually tried to 'seek out new civilizations.' Yes, going back to the movie at hand. I loved the fact they got an unknown and not Matt Damon as Captain Kirk. Yea, Matt Damon might as well have been a great choice... but it would just be Matt Damon playing himself. His personality in movies are already too much like Captain Kirk. He's too likable, gets the chicks, and can beat up everybody. I'm sure no one minded Pierce Brosnan becoming James Bond in Goldeneye or Jack Nicholson become the Joker in Bat Man as they were already 'perfect' for that role, but seeing Heath 'Brokeback Mountain' Ledger becoming the Joker? Unheard of! Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in the first X-men? Hugh who? A blonde Daniel Craig as Bond? What? Just to clarify, these untested unknowns have now 'become' these beloved characters to the fanboys. Simply put, these actors had to 'try harder' to get over all the hoops and suspicions of the audience and wound up with something better, more original, and daring. While Chris Pine as Kirk wasn't some great breakthrough role, I appreciated the fact that he wound up as far from being any parody or a caricature (Let's face it--how can you NOT make a caricature of Captain Kirk? Everybody....else and...their grandmother....has). True, Karl Urban, being spot-on perfect as Mc Coy ALMOST treaded the line toward caricature, but he was so excellent at it, it was a tear-jerking homage more than anything. Zachary 'Sylar' Quinto as Spock--he brought dimension to what could've otherwise have been a flat character in the wrong hands. I generally dislike most portrayals of Vulcans in Star Trek--Leonard Nimoy as Spock was probably the only Vulcan that I liked. I LIKED Sylar's Spock. There was actual inner struggle in this version of Spock, which can be both good and bad, but it makes sense...I'll merely say: 'Facinating.' Anton Yelchin's Russian accent as Chekov, however...well.... I didn't mind. Wasn't Chekov already kind of like a stereotype? Haha. I dunno. I still liked him. Hey, it was the Cold War back then--having a Russian in a USS starfleet was quite an accomplishment in itself. There were also small and major details I did love. One was a scene where Spock beams down on a planet while crouching. This kind of detail made perfect sense especially assuming that most planetary (or rocky) surfaces are usually not level. Another great treat, a major one, was that there was actually a scene where James Kirk takes the Kobayashi Maru test, which was mentioned before (or would that be late?) in the best (and still best) film of the series, Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan.Admittedly, much like the other movies of the series, the new Star Trek film doesn't 'seek out new civilizations' either. However, given the fact that it's more about the introduction of the characters and their quirks and what they're capable of and how they came to be where they are, I can let that fact go (for now). It may simply be better that they 'seek out' in the next movie instead (which hopefully won't be about dogfights but actual exploration). It's sometimes just hard to fit everything in. Even movies like Spider-Man and Batman Begins, where the main character goes through a journey from ordinary to extraordinary, one wonders if it's so important to have a major baddie in the first film given that the bad guy will always lose screen time to the main guy. In the case of this movie, where there are lots of main characters, this discrepancy may be quite noticeable, even though I think Eric Bana as the Romulan baddie Nero handled it perfectly well and I have no real complaints on that regard. After all, thanks to time travel (one of the central parts of my aforementioned nitpick), the bad guy appears to the good guys ready-made and angry, ready for consumption (to become cannon fodder) like an instant TV dinner. I wonder if they have a 'bad-guy replicator' in the future? Nitpicks aside, the action is aplenty, the special effects are excellent, the characters are lovable, and you want to see them win (a good sign) and well, what do you expect? Overall, a very good film: 9/10.",9,3,11,11 May 2009
Iron Man 2," Not the usual kind of sequel
","In Iron Man 2, Robert Downey Jr. returns as billionaire Tony Stark, this time facing pressures from the government to share his armor technology with the military. At the same time, he discovers the technology which keeps him alive is also slowly killing him. He appoints Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as CEO of Stark Industries, while her old job goes to Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson). Meanwhile, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the son of his father's enemy, joins forces with Stark's rival competitor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell).First off, I enjoyed the first Iron Man, but I wasn't a huge fan. I felt Jon Favreau's direction and Robert Downey Jr. made the film better than what it could've been. Tony Stark was fun, story was okay, and the villain was a bit disappointing. The idea of the villain being just another version of the protagonist never appealed to me. I felt the same way about the wannabe-Hulk villain in Incredible Hulk. Now, if the villain is very different from the hero (Joker vs. Batman / Superman vs. Lex Luthor / Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock), the hero has to apply different strategies, which makes for more entertaining battles. Well, in the Iron Man sequel, that idea hasn't changed too much—Iron Man still battles a similar foe, although there are now more of them. Thankfully, the shootouts, the flights, the computerized special effects, and the mass destruction are a lot of fun to watch, but it is not the central focus.This film's focus is all about the characters, an unusual direction for a sequel. It's no Transformers 2, that's for sure. Majority of the time, you won't see Tony Stark in armor. You do, however, get to see a bit of a darker and a vulnerable side to Tony, which happens to make him more complex, engaging, and sometimes, dangerous. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony flawlessly, and he's just as much fun, if not more, than before. Some may be put off by the dialogue-driven first half of the film. The film isn't all about 'let's hurry up and get him to fight somebody.' In fact, it takes its time, and there's not a whole lot of action in the beginning, but there's a certain build-up that leads to the eventual confrontation with the baddies. The film isn't so much about a specific villain or a goal, but it is mainly about Tony, his psychology, and his reactions to life. Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts—she is as we remember her from the last film—charming and continuously getting Stark out of trouble.Many interesting side characters make an appearance this time around. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) plays more of a prominent role as the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. Scarlett Johansson has great screen presence as Natalie Rushman (aka. Black Widow)—she holds herself pretty well in a great martial arts scene. Don Cheadle has replaced Terrance Howard as Lt. Col. 'Rhodey' and gets to play a more prominent role as an Iron Man suit-armored partner to Tony. This film, unlike the first film, tends to lean towards the idea of teamwork more. (Perhaps they're just prepping us for an Avenger film?) Mickie Rourke is engaging on screen as the Russian physicist villain Ivan, which he plays with dark relish. Although his technology—glowing, electrically charged whips—isn't anything new, he is always fun to watch. Likewise, Sam Rockwell is great as usual as a villain, the wisecracking Justin Hammer.The plot simply continues on from the last film, after people have found out the true identity of Iron Man. While it's nothing too complex, the progression of the story is logical--it would surely bring some enemies out of the woodwork if they knew who he was. The film's pacing isn't as zippy as the first film, where something always seems to be happening, and some audiences may be disappointed as a result.Overall, I found Iron Man 2 to be entertaining and a worthy sequel, and just different enough not to feel tacked on like an add-on to the previous film. Many sequels can get lazy—they just throw in everything and make it bigger and louder. Some sequels simply let the story progress. This is that kind of sequel. I give Iron Man 2 *** out of **** stars.You can also follow my reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art",8,7,12,19 May 2010
Spider-Man 2," Does whatever a spider can and then some!
","Peter Parker returns again on this excellent sequel to last year's Spider-Man.  The characters are more defined, the story more complicated, and the action even more satisfying.  One may say of the previous movie that it was more a character-driven film than an action movie and this one equally follows suit, thankfully.  For those who are familiar with the comic (I myself am a fan) will notice that much of Peter's life is filled with angst and you get see a substantial portion of that here as he juggles his social life and his superhero life.  Tobey Maguire adds more depth to his acting muscles as he alternates from poignantly sad scenes to hilarious mishaps.  Kirsten Dunst has a more well-defined and well-written role here as Peter's long-suffering love interest.  J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is nearly flawless and has some of the best lines ever.  As for the action scenes... I've seen this movie twice now, the second time recently on IMAX. The action scenes are still pretty spectacular (it was even more apparent seeing it in an even bigger screen) and doesn't spend too much time on already-noticeable details for 'maximum effect.'  In fact, some parts zoom by so quickly it can be tough just trying to keep up with the furious action.  Sam Raimi knows how to frame it just right so the swinging among the buildings by Spider-Man looks breathtaking.  What is really cool about a movie such as this is that it doesn't rely on the tried-and-true easy way of entertainment (eg. action).  Every action set piece in this film feels well-earned as it is placed on a foundation of strong characterization and story.  10/10.  One of the rare great sequels that outshine the original, right up there among the greats  as 'Toy Story 2' and 'Empire Strikes Back.'",10,1,2,23 August 2004
The Expendables," 'The Expendables' is old school with both good and the bad
","In this new action film directed by Sylvester Stallone, Barney Ross (Stallone) leads a gang of highly skilled mercenaries, which includes knife-expert Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial artist Yin Yang (Jet Li), heavy weapons specialist Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), demolitionist Toll Road (Randy Couture) and sniper Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren). They are hired by Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) to assassinate a dictator General Garza (David Zayas) on a South American Island called Vilena. While there, Barney befriends local rebel Sandra (Giselle Itié), whom he takes it upon himself to rescue from the dictator and his pal, the rogue ex-CIA operative James Munroe (Eric Roberts).As of late, I had found Sylvester Stallone-directed films to be a good vacation from all the colorful, CG-fied, bloodless, MTV-style dizzying action flicks out there (I'm looking at you, A-Team). I enjoyed both his Rocky Balboa and the new Rambo. They're great guy films with guys who look like guys. They're also meaner and unsophisticated. And, that's okay—action heroes don't have to be sensitive, domesticated and 'whipped' men.Now that I have seen the film, I got mostly what I expected and wanted, yet, I did wish there was more to it. The Expendables is a great idea on paper, having all the old-school 80's action stars together to go on a mission to take on some big baddie. Now, the hard part is to make it all work together as a whole, and that's where the film falters a bit. It's unevenly balanced as certain side characters became more simplified than others and the central plot regarding the dictator gets lost occasionally. Sylvester Stallone is in good form as his usual action hero self, with good-natured banter and lots of tattoos. Jason Statham gets good screen time, and Jet Li gets some action in. Dolph Lundgren is in great form, looking more dangerous and meaner this time around. Eric Roberts bring a lot of fun energy as the well-dressed, quick-talking villain, James Munroe. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger make brief appearances. Mickey Rourke is engaging in his brief moments of dialogue.This film truly soars when there is action. They're often bloody and very messy. I found the lack of CG, the plethora of explosions (and people jumping from it) and chopped limbs falling off unrealistically pretty fun to watch. It's messy in that hard-action 80's sort of way. At the same time, some of the action scenes were hard to follow due to many quick cuts in the editing. I would have preferred to see long takes when Jet Li is doing his scenes, personally. Sylvester Stallone still seems quite fit for his role, using everything from guns to bone-cracking hand-to-hand combat.The film's pacing feels rather stagnant outside the action scenes. The dialogue, for the most part, is cheesy 80's macho stuff, but fun. They are not very descriptive, but the delivery is good. There are no references to modern pop culture, which is a plus. Most of the character focus is on Barney (Stallone) and Lee Christmas (Statham), while the others became more two-dimensional. The story meanders from the central plot with a change of scenery with a side plot regarding Lee Christmas' love life and an altercation with Gunner Jensen. The scenes are a lot of fun in themselves, but do not particularly mesh too well with the whole.This film is essentially a celebration of the 80's action film—the macho flick with explosions and tough talk. There are certainly plenty of that here, despite some unevenness. I think the story could've been more focused and I may've preferred if the whole story took place at Vilena instead of going back and forth. Admittedly, with the all-star cast, my overall expectation may have been a tad high. I did enjoy it more than The A-Team, though.For more of my reviews you can follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art",7,3,8,5 September 2010
The Town," 'The Town' is a complex, engrossing thriller
","Directed by Ben Affleck, based on the novel Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan, The Town takes place in Charlestown, Massachusetts. It is a heist/police thriller about four masked bank robbers--Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James 'Jem' Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan (Slaine), and Desmond 'Dez' Elden (Owen Burke)--who wind up taking a hostage during a robbery--the bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall). They release her, blindfolded. Unsure whether Claire might somehow be able to finger them, Doug pays a visit to her (her not having seen him) and asks her out on a date, which turns into a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is tailing the four suspects.After seeing this film, as I was stepping out of the theater, an elderly man who just walked in, asked me, 'Was it good?' I replied with my first two-word review: 'Very good.' He said, 'Okay!' For some, that short-and-sweet review would suffice. For the rest, the following is my longer version.If you have seen the trailer, it appears to be the standard Hollywood plot—the sympathetic villain falls in love with the hostage, betrays his own guys, and maybe end with an elaborate hail of gunfire, and so forth. It's the general plot line for films that involve professional killers—This Gun For Hire, The Killer, The Professional, Bittersweet Life, etc. Luckily, this film is more complex. In fact, the love story doesn't take that much of the center stage. The story looks more into the environment, the people, and the relationships that form a person. AdvertisementIn terms of style, this film could be considered a close cousin of Heat and a second cousin of Point Break, but with more drama. The action scenes have an efficient coldness to it that makes it look realistic. As impressive as the action scenes are, this film is mainly character-driven. Ben Affleck's direction is top notch. The pacing is nearly flawless. The car chases through small alleyways of Boston is reminiscent of French Connection. The gun-fights are loud and gritty. The film has just enough small surprises and cleverness that makes it unique. The characters' back stories, their history, and the crime culture bring an extra bit of dimension. The dialogue is frequently witty and playful. I suppose it helps that the story was based on a novel. Ben Affleck is understated and solid as Doug MacRay, the planner of the heists. While it is not an unusual role for Affleck playing the sympathetic one, he feels like a real person. His relationship with his jailbird father played by Chris Cooper adds an extra dimension. Particularly noteworthy is Jeremy Renner's intriguing performance, which invokes an unnerving unpredictability to the character of 'Jem,' Doug's close friend and cohort. Renner's character is nearly the opposite of the soft-hearted hero he played in The Hurt Locker—here, he is creepy, erratic, and has no problem killing people off.Overall, this is a character-driven, solid crime thriller with good direction from Ben Affleck. The performances are first rate and while the action is strong, the film's focus on human drama is what brings this film up a notch. I couldn't quite predict where the film was going. The pacing is good. It's been a while since I've seen an engrossing heist thriller like this one. It's good. Okay, very good.

Shutter Island," 'Shutter Island' is an unsettling, haunting journey
","In the Martin Scorsese's new film Shutter Island, Leonardo Di Caprio plays U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels, who is assigned to investigate a disappearance of a female patient in a mental hospital for the criminally insane on the remote Shutter Island. As he uncovers clues, he suspects a conspiracy involving the doctors performing mind-altering experiments on patients. When a hurricane cuts off communication from the mainland and many dangerous criminals escape, Teddy finds out that the happenings on Shutter Island are a lot more twisted than he realized.Since Martin Scorsese's big Oscar win with The Departed, he returns again with Leonardo Di Caprio in a starring role. Given the fact the movie takes place in 1954, one can't help approaching the film as some sort of a biopic, helped by the similarity of look to Scorsese/Di Caprio period pieces like Gangs of New York and The Aviator. However, one would be better prepared to approach it like a Hitchcockian thriller, or perhaps even a horror film. While there are many details that take place outside the island, the focus is really on the island itself and Teddy's relation to it.The ominous setting, lighting, and the attention to period detail is quite intricate, with stark shadows and grey skies giving an oppressive atmosphere of gloom. One is reminded of Hitchcockian motifs of rocky shores, dangerous cliffs, punctuated by moody score, mixed with dizzying dream sequences involving dead people reminiscent of David Lynch's work. As he does with his other films, here, Scorsese has created a world that engulfs you, as he has a special talent of getting under your skin, making it an unsettling experience.Leonardo Di Caprio's engaging performance truly sells this movie, as he breathes life into Teddy Daniels with a lot of conviction and pathos. It is this character with a haunted past that pushes the plot forward, as it is important that we the audience discovers with him what he uncovers (and we do). Mark Ruffalo as Chuck Aule, his partner in the case, does a fine job as his sidekick. Ben Kingsley brings a lot of weight and sinister intelligence to the role of psychiatrist Dr. Cawley, while Max von Sydow as Dr. Naehring has a cold candor and look that reminds one of a Nazi doctor. These characters, along with the inhabitants of the hospital, help contribute to the overall atmosphere of paranoia.I enjoyed this thriller and appreciated the way the suspense was built gradually, not relying too heavily on the usual scare tactics. The film is suspenseful, unsettling, and dark. It is not a 'pleasant' film to watch, or a popcorn film—it's just not that kind of film. It demands attention. I did notice that the plot itself didn't have to be as large a scale as Scorsese presented it, but it helped. If left in different hands, the film would've been a lot different, and certainly not as strong. At 138 minutes, the film can feel like a sensory overload for some, yet it's immersive. Whatever opinion one may have of Scorsese's films in general, they aren't comfort films—they're often potent and leave an impression. I appreciated how the plot was a little different than his previous works, yet a style that's still his own. It is a haunting, unsettling thriller that kept me thinking more about it afterwards. I'll say it's even closer to a horror film, a pretty good one. I give Shutter Island *** out of **** stars.You can find my updates of movie reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art",8,3,10,23 February 2010
Tangled," Visually flawless 'Tangled' gets nearly everything right.
","Tangled is the latest Disney animation that flawlessly captures the whole 'Disney Princess' genre from its traditional cell animation in full computer graphics (also shown in stereoscopic 3-D format). In this retelling of the Rapunzel story, Princess Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) is kidnapped from the palace as a baby by Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and raised as her own due to Rapunzel's magical hair. Rapunzel has since been imprisoned in a tower until her 18th birthday, when she strikes a deal with a bandit named Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) to escape and see up close the strange floating lights that she sees every year on her birthday from her tower. Meanwhile, Gothel, a group of bandits, and the King's guards are in hot pursuit.Finally Disney nearly gets everything right. Almost. Visually, this film is right up there with Pixar's workactually, it even manages to surpass in that arena. This is saying A LOT. Still, the real strength of Pixar's work is how each of their films all work as a whole package, hanging on the strength of its storytelling, characterization, and high concept. It is in these last three points that Disney's Tangled comes very close but not quite reach, yet, that's understandable given that it's based on a well-known fairy tale, and let's face it, when it comes to Disney animation, it has certain rules--repetitive ones at that. There's the recurring cute non-speaking sidekick, the music numbers, the evil stepmother, and couple other rules which will become clear when you see it. Their concept and stories are quite similar to each other, but Tangled does make some novel changes that work well quite dramatically and humorously. The characters have a modern edge to them that makes them fun, yet not derivative. The visual jokes are quite sophisticated and the film never overdoes it.The characters all closely mimic the traditional 2-D Disney character style. Rapunzel beautifully shines in this film. Her expressions, the facial structure, the cute nose, the perfect skin tones, and the big eyes look amazingly alive. The movements of her and all the characters here are spot on. They move just like 2-D animation, yet realistically. The action scenes are breath-taking. I could just watch Rapunzel move around and simply be amazed at the artistry. Likewise, Flynn Ryder and Mother Gothel are well-crafted, humorously and carefully animated. However, if there was one character that steals the show every moment that he appears on screen, that would have to be a certain horse named Maximus. Truly, if there's an Oscar for a CG character, he'd win hands down. If I ever meet the guy who animated this character, I'd love to shake his hand.Mandy Moore is flawless as the voice of Rapunzel. I really can't add anything else to say without being redundant. Zachary Levi brings much personality and fun as Flynn Ryder with his expressive voice and perfect timing, which sound strangely like Steve Carell. Yeah, try listening to him with your eyes closed and tell me if you disagree.Now, the film is not without some flaws. The music numbers can be a tad distracting—admittedly, they weren't particularly memorable. The film would have been just fine without them, but they're not bad. Second, there's a rather predicable nature in the way this film follows a common, worn Disney formula—it's hard to elaborate without spoilers. There's also an underlying meanness in this film that Pixar films tend not to have (yet Pixar films manage to be more mature and thought-provoking than many live-action films). This film is here to entertain and in that way, it succeeds. Disney films are meant to make you want to believe in love and magic, not heady subjects like family relations (Finding Nemo, Incredibles, Up), loyalty (Ratatouille), community (Bug's Life), mortality (Toy Story series), and problems of pride (Cars).Whatever flaws one may look for, they are actually quite trivial compared to the rest of this film. There's no doubt that this film is a great technical leap forward in almost every way, successfully duplicating the beauty, creativity, and imagination of its traditional, animated roots. Disney has done it quite marvelously here. Bravo! For more of my reviews, you can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art",9,1,3,17 December 2010
Shrek Forever After," 'Shrek Forever After' is a glass half-empty
","In the 3-D (and stereoscopic) animated film, Shrek Forever After, Shrek, the green ogre, has become bored with the domesticated life of raising children with his wife, Princess Fiona, along with the fact that no one treats him with any fear or respect. One day, Shrek feels he has had it and makes a pact with Rumplestiltskin, a deal-making magician of sorts, to feel like a real ogre for a day. When he finds out he's been duped and sent to a twisted version of Far Far Away, where Rumplestiltskin is king, ogres are hunted, and Fiona doesn't know him, he sets to get his life back and reclaim his true love.This one is the fourth installment of the Shrek series. I haven't seen the third one, as I had heard many horrible things about it. I have seen the first two, which I've enjoyed immensely. First film offered a clever, humorous twist on fairy tales. Second goes farther with the twists by adding pop-culture references re-imagined in context of the fairy tales. Both were very inventive and full of energy and details. This version, unfortunately, feels like all of that has been reduced by half. In general fun and humor, it's straight-to-DVD quality, although you can't get the stereoscopic view. The jokes aren't as funny as it used to be. The details and environments also feel somewhat desolate this time around. The subtleties are gone.The stereoscopic 3-D aspect of the film feels like it's been tacked in there. The flying scenes inside the castle are kind of neat, but during most of the film, I didn't even notice that it was in 3-D. Don't expect anything as grand or beautiful or clever as How To Train Your Dragon.I suppose by the fourth film, it is inevitable that much of the joy of the first and second film will have been drained out. I assume the storytellers are running out of ideas when sequels revert to a time-travel idea (I'm reminded of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Turtles in Time) or a 'reboot' of sorts. Yes, it's essentially a reboot because much of the film is an alternate timeline, and Shrek has to meet his friends all over again who don't recognize him. It's kind of like getting re-acquainted with Arnold Schwartzenegger's T-100 in Terminator 3. It also doesn't help that the plot concept has been done before, such as in It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Destiny. The plot progression is essentially by-the-numbers, and so is a good chunk of the humor. It never feels quite organic. There is more slapstick than jokes. Sadly, in my theater, I couldn't hear any kids laughing at any of the jokes, which wasn't a good sign.However, there are some good moments in the film. Despite the overused plot, Shrek is still a likable character. Eddie Murphy's Donkey is still around. Conrad Vernon's Rumplestiltskin is a mean yet somewhat dark character, reminding me of John Lithgow's Lord Farquaadalmost. The Pied Piper as a baddie is an ingenious idea—how I wished the film centered more on this guy! A scene involving Rumplestiltskin's 'half-full' glass of water is also excellent. I even liked the fact that Shrek goes through something like a midlife crisis. I only wished it was handled in a way that wasn't so familiar.Overall, it's not a bad film. It's just doesn't live up to the potential set by the previous films I saw. If there was no Shrek 1 and 2, it may've been considered a pretty decent film--of course, it also means there shouldn't be other good 3-D animations to compete with. Nevertheless, friends have told me this installment is still miles better than the third one. I guess I won't be seeing the third one for sure. I give Shrek Forever After ** out of **** stars.You can also follow my more recent reviews on twitter.com/d_art",6,2,4,5 September 2010
Ratatouille," Masterpiece!
","I absolutely adored this movie. 'Toy Story 2' was my favorite Pixar Movie ever and I have to say 'Ratatouille' is right up there, comparable, if not surpassing it as a great film. Yes, I liked it more than 'Incredibles.' The visuals are the best (near flawless) I've seen in a 3-D animated film thus far. The story is rich with details, characters, subtleties, and sophisticated ideas. It also contained two of the funniest, unexpected moments (I think) in Pixar movie history. Yes, there were key moments when the crowd just cheered. There were moments where I was saying to myself... 'oh no, you're kidding me..' in the best way possible.Only downside for some is that some might not find the subject of culinary art as interesting as superheroes, explosions, robots, and fuzzy aliens. Nevertheless, it is full of action, great visual gags, and a strong story. Pixar obviously took a huge risk with the subject and I must say, it is executed near flawlessly! Having visited France before, it was nice to see some recognizable landscapes as well. More and more I see Pixar's work, more I'm surprised at the way they re-invent cinema through very unique stories and subjects. I hope they continue on this wonderful tradition.",10,0,3,4 November 2007
Batman Begins," batman begins. nicely begun.
","Now, it's hard to review a movie like this (a big budget, comic book fair) without comparing it to a yet another franchise, Spider-Man. First off, I should add I absolutely loved Spider-Man 2 and can ramble on and on about bigger ideas and how it works in different levels, etc., but I won't since this is a Batman Begins review. Second off, I enjoyed Batman Begins. As hinted in the title, the whole film is about how Batman came to be who he is. Much like Spider-Man, a tragedy struck within the family of the main character, which ultimately contributed to the character becoming a hero. One of the nice things about characters that go through such things is that it helps us to delve more into the psychology of the character (irrelevant to whether the character has powers or not), and luckily, we get to see that more clearly in this film than the previous ones.The tough thing about making a movie about a character that hides in the dark most of the time is the balance that must be made between the mythical aspect of the character (where mystery makes the character more interesting--eg. Boba Fett) vs. their more human, relatable aspects. Can Darth Vader still command that presence if we know his history as a bratty kid who whines a lot? (This is where I will say Episode III did a fine job of making that transition) Thankfully, the writers did a fine job of fleshing out this Bruce Wayne character (without making him too silly--the fact that he's running around dressed as a bat) and every motivation seem to be answered for in a logical, understandable manner. Christian Bale does an admirable job as a younger, tougher, and more thoughtful Batman. Katie Holmes, despite the fact her looking rather young to be a D.A., brings a good complimentary balance to the Bale character. It also doesn't hurt to have the supporting cast of well-knowns as Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson in the picture as well. Liam Neeson also gets to play a nice meaty role similar to a (Jedi?) master to Bruce Wayne's apprentice, with much cooler lines.I probably would not have appreciated this movie as much if it didn't go beyond into deeper thoughts. Questions like, what is the difference between social justice and personal revenge? (Similarly, what I got from Spider-Man was that it wasn't really about how cool it is to have super-powers, but the idea of using any special gift responsibly) Even Bruce Wayne's motivations are questioned--are his actions based on his vengeance for his parents or is it for justice, beyond himself? That's what I like about these superhero stories--when it's not so much about all the cool stuff they do, but when we see how/why they do the things they do (and maybe, inspire us). It is cool that Bruce Wayne's character goes through various changes (most well-developed characters do) and we understand him better. The director Christopher Nolan (who directed one of my favorite movies, Memento) displays his craft to the hilt, with every scene sparkling with beauty and atmosphere and a good amount of grittiness. Here's a guy I'd like to see more work coming out from (even his less-hyped work Insomnia with Al Pacino was quite different from a regular type of thriller, along with a non-crowd pleaser type of ending). A vast improvement from the previous 2 films (the ones not directed by Tim Burton), this is a solid film that has many things going for it. A good beginning, indeed.",9,0,0,27 June 2005
The Incredibles," Look up in the sky! Is it a bird? Yes, it's indeed Brad Bird
","There's something very homey/cozy about The Incredibles the way Iron Giant (also directed by Brad Bird) was. It had a certain quietness to it where jokes don't need to be happening every few seconds (which Disney tries to do a lot--which also tries to cover up the shallowness of their storytelling), because, well, the whole idea and genre is funny in itself. The whole idea of an overweight, aging superhero working in an ill-fit cubicle with that certain expression on his face speaks volumes. It's not a type of joke you get by trying to verbally explaining it to somebody. Unlike the previous Pixar film 'Finding Nemo,' this film goes for a more minimalistic, almost 2-D in nature, more expressive and animated. It's not breath-takingly realistic (although there are moments that blew me away) as it's more stylized, cartoony. Some will complain about certain slow spots as the story builds on the characters and situations (not much unlike Iron Giant), but that's where moments of clever ideas and dialogue sets in. While I visually enjoyed 'Finding Nemo,' I have to say some of the inventiveness of such films as Toy Story series and Incredibles wasn't as prevalent in that movie.In that sense, I found Incredibles to be much more satisfying than 'Finding Nemo', 'Bug's Life' and 'Monsters Inc.' It's not as up there as 'Toy Story 2' (which I consider very very high in terms CG movies, and probably one of the best sequels ever made) but comes pretty close. I must say one of the reasons Pixar movies tend to be a step above most animations (even Shrek 2) is that beyond all the technical aspects, there's often something a little more deep, if not poignant, in the stories. Incredibles is no exception. The characters go through human struggles and obstacles that many people (even the fishes in Finding Nemo had human struggles) go through. They may not be exactly the same struggles we are familiar with, but there are certainly parallels. We may not have super-powers, but we all have certain gifts which we can maximize for good, or purpose. Many adults, who grew up with Superman, X-men, and Fantastic Four will find a lot of the powers quite familiar, and I must say I'm happy to see Ice-M..I mean, Frozone, utilize his powers in so many clever ways as well as all the other great characters. The way the film goes, it's pretty inevitable that there will most likely be a sequel, although I'm not sure if that basically means Disney, and not Pixar (which will move on from Disney), will work on the sequel (I'd love a sequel, only if Pixar does it). Overall, 'The Incredibles' is clever, satirical, thoughtful, heart-warming, and extremely enjoyable. Among films I've seen this year, this film leaves a nice, satisfying grin in my face. 10/10",9,0,1,8 November 2004
Cars 2," What 'Cars 2' does, it does well.
","In this sequel to Cars, race cars Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his tow truck pal Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) head overseas to compete in the World Grand Prix race. Mater, however, gets sidetracked with international espionage. Helped by British spy cars, Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), Mater must stop an unknown villain trying to sabotage the race, with Lightning McQueen as his possible target.I liked the first Cars, but I admit, amongst the other works of Pixar, it was my least favorite. With that said, I really enjoyed Cars 2. Yes, more so than Cars 1. It's very entertaining with both subtle and not-so-subtle humor that not everyone will quite get nor appreciate. The scenes in Tokyo are colorful and extreme. The scenes in Paris and Italy are breathtaking and beautifully rendered. This is a story about cars. There's only so many ways you can go with this subject. With that said, Pixar has again created a piece of work that remains consistent to their high quality.Admittedly, Lightning McQueen, the main character in the last film played by Owen Wilson, gets less of a role here compared to Mater, played by Larry the Cable Guy. I would guess some may have a big problem with this. To be frank, Larry the Cable Guy's brand of humor isn't to everyone's taste (nor mine), and perhaps represents what makes one feel embarrassed for being Americanespecially when in a foreign country. Well, that issue is exactly what comes up in this particular film. Mater is a constant embarrassment for Lightning McQueen whenever he is around—he is ignorant, unsophisticated, and often gets himself into bad situations. What Pixar does here, however, is not to simply leave Mater to just be the butt of every joke. In fact, the characters here actually learn somethingor at least we do. The theme in this film is about friendship and seeing value in people we normally would rather not associate ourselves with.The story is strong and twists are rather mind-boggling enough to keep little kids confused (but as an adult, I thought it was great!). Making Mater the main character, on a practical level, makes sense. Frankly, there are only so many more stories you can really squeeze out about Lightning McQueen at this point—everything already had been told in the last film. It's like a Rocky movie. Rocky sequels were okay, yes, but after a while, Rocky was no longer the underdog—now it's all about him keeping his title (it's like a story about a rich man staying rich)—there are not a whole lot of ways you can go with that plot (I suppose Rocky's next sequel could have him fight in spaceI know! Time machine! Brilliant!). One can say Cars 2 is like the further adventures of Rocky's Paulie, Mickey, or Adrian, from their point of view. I thought that was a good move. It's like how Empire Strikes Back was really Han Solo's film (although that is open for discussion).In the previous film, I didn't care much about Mater. I learned to like him in this film. A simple character has been made a little more complex. Lightning McQueen learns a valuable lesson about friendship, and Mater learns to self-reflect. Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy are fun as always as Mater and McQueen. Michael Caine is excellent as Finn McMissile, a super agent spy car, and Emily Mortimer does fine work as Holley Shiftwell.The overall feel of this film is more 'mature'-flavored without being overtly mature. This is true for much of Pixar's films in general. If you think about many classic Warner Bros. films, for example, they had many underlying mature themes. As for Pixar, they have explored, among others, themes related to mortality (Toy Story series), the family unit (The Incredibles) and fatherhood (Finding Nemo, Up). Cars do come in harm's way in this film. Some do explode. Nothing shocking here. They're cars. I dug the action scenes. This plays like a spy thriller, which admittedly, is more exciting than watching car races. Like much of Pixar's work, there is plenty of humor, a great helping of emotion, beautiful renders, and a clever story. I can't think of anything more to ask for than that. Now, did Cars really need a sequel? Perhaps not, but I enjoyed this one and it makes me even like the previous one. I'm not really into talking cars, talking bugs, or talking fishes, personally, but Pixar still manages to make me like them.For more of my review updates, you can find me on twitter.com/d_art",10,1,4,27 June 2011
Kick-Ass," 'Kick-Ass' is entertaining to watch but with mixed aftertaste
","In this film, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a high-schooler who isn't particularly popular or athletic, but loves comics. One day, he decides to don a superhero costume, name himself 'Kick Ass,' and fight crime at night. After few mishaps, he succeeds, and becomes an instant celebrity. Then, he meets Big Daddy and the 11-year-old Hit Girl, couple of more capable (and secretive) masked vigilantes, who are trying to take down the crime boss Frank D'Amico. He winds up joining forces with them. Meanwhile, D'Amico hatches a plan to kill him.The film is directed stylishly by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake), based on a comic book by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. The film starts off like a teen comedy with Dave and his friends talking about girls, comics, and how there aren't any heroes around. I really liked the premise of the film—the whole 'what if' scenario of a normal person fighting crime in a real world (that is, without all the money that Bruce Wayne in Batman had), which is probably why I loved the first 30 minutes of it. Once the mafia and other heroes come in, it goes more into that superhero action movie mode with explosions and other stuff people pay for.Aaron Johnson plays his role as the geeky Dave with great conviction and sympathy. His character is heroic not because he is capable, but he has a heart of a hero. Chloe Moretz plays the 11-year old Hit Girl with a lot of attitude. There's certainly some shock value of a little kid cussing and vanquishing bad guys, but more on that later. Nicholas Cage brings a lot of dark humor playing the oddball father role as Big Daddy.The plot pretty much takes the initial premise and just runs with it, breaking many rules along the way. There's teen angst humor aplenty, the geek dialogue is a lot of fun, and there's occasional dark violence, which can be a mixed bag. There's a certain optimistic innocence to the character of Dave, which is nice in context of the story, but the limits of realism of the film's world can be rather unclear. Perhaps it's more for sake of realism (or is it?), but the heroes are allowed to kill people (well, at least the bad guys). I can imagine Sylvester Stallone from Judge Dredd screaming, 'I'm not under the law—I am the law!' Traditionally, though, even up to the more realistic The Dark Knight, killing is the one rule that heroes often don't break—and they take it more seriously. Given the fact that this is a comic book movie, or at least a celebration of that genre, it's surprising that it's not at least addressed. But, it helps the action, so it's mostly glossed over.The action is fun to look at, quite well-edited, but rather unsettling, when one thinks about it. I take it the novelty here is seeing an 11-year old girl cussing and ruthlessly gunning down adults (yes, they're still bad guys) in stylistic, over-the-top fashion. I suppose it works within the context of a comic book movie, yet we see gore and blood and gunshots rather realistically. Quite a desensitized kid we have here. Now, imagine if we had a black kid playing this part. There would be a huge uproar and this film would be amongst the most controversial movies ever made (never mind that these are still bad guys getting killed). Of course, we don't really believe that a little girl could ever do that stuff in real life, which is why many are not as bothered by it. It's dismissed as usual comic book silliness (at least until we see a similar event happening in the news). Call me sensitive, but it left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth.This film, overall, was entertaining, unique, and certainly had no shortage of style. Some compared this movie to The Dark Knight—I guess they must've not liked The Dark Knight as much as I did. The Dark Knight had a lot more layer and Christopher Nolan's works are always more complex beyond the surface. I also prefer Watchmen and Spider-Man over this. This film is well-acted, the dialogue is interesting, and I liked the characters enough to wish they make it to the end. Beyond the surface, though, the film isn't quite as fun as I'd like it to be. On occasion, Dave sometimes did feel like second fiddle compared to Hit Girl and Big Daddy, who are the ones pushing the plot forward. And, of course, that mixed aftertaste I had.I recall a nice moment in the film where an onlooker at a window watches a mugging-in-progress, then merely looks away, not even calling the police—Dave then points out that average people have become desensitized about things like justice. I really appreciated that scene. I wondered what would've happened if the film expanded on that idea about society? Perhaps he'll discover we don't really need a costumed hero in allowing justice to be done. We can all be heroes by doing the bare minimum of looking out for each other. After all, desire for justice is one of the reasons we are inspired by superheroes. It certainly could've been a more interesting, multilayered movie.

Clash of the Titans," The new 'Clash of the Titans' makes a poor case for 3-D and remakes.
","Sam Worthington stars as Perseus, the half-human son of Zeus, in this 2010 remake of the 1981 classic, Clash of the Titans. In this version, Zeus is offended by man's lack of deference to them and, along with Hades (Ralph Feinnes), allows the Kraken to attack the city of Argos. The only way to satiate the Kraken's wrath is if princess Andromeda is sacrificed. Perseus and a band of warriors go in search of the head of Medusa which will defeat the Kraken, thus saving Andromeda.Now, I grew up with the original and have loved its creature-creator Ray Harryhausen's work in the film and other classics he did. If anyone made a remake, the bar had already been set by the original. Well, I was disappointed when the remake's trailer came out (see my article). Sorry to say, I'm now equally disappointed with the remake itself (and I wasn't even expecting much).The biggest problem with this movie is the 3-D, especially in light of the fact that the 3-D glasses have been the reason we've been paying more for films these days. Many scenes here looked concave (when they shouldn't) or like cardboard cut-outs, much like those children's pop-up books. Some scenes (in the beginning) gave me headaches (a problem I've never had before). A note to future 3-D filmmakers: Don't do short quick-cutsbut if you do, make sure they're less stereoscopic (or just make it 2-D in those scenes)—it's a strain on your eyes. I'm willing to bet that this aspect clouded my enjoyment of this film, which might've been okay otherwise. Sam Worthington felt miscast as Perseus. A bit on the emotionally stiff side, it didn't help that his character was written like a two-dimensional character. Most of the time, he wasn't given much to do (or love) but fight, and well, his Australian accent just didn't sound Greek enough. The warriors that come along with him are generally cookie cutouts from other films. Liam Neeson does fine in the role of Zeus, even if he didn't get to do much—he manages to sound quite majestic. I loved Ralph Feinnes' version of Hades—it was original and he embodied a more subtle, lonely kind of menace. He was simply the best thing about this film. I'll add that I did like some of the sets and I felt the film's musical score helped give some drama in some scenes.The story of this new version is loosely based on the original, which was loosely based on Greek mythology. It would've been better if they had went straight to the source, but...oh well (a laziness on the filmmakers' part). Some characters and story arcs have been omitted, familiar elements from other movies have been added in (eg. Gladiator, Hero), and this film is now pretty much an action film. One of the aspects I didn't like (and this isn't a spoiler since she appears only for a bit) is that Andromeda is now no longer Perseus' love interest—which pretty much means we don't care if she gets sacrificed on not (in fact, her sacrifice might've saved a lot of trouble and many dead soldiers). A pity, really, because Perseus is quite two-dimensional enough as it is, and could've used more motivation for his mission. The creatures in this version are mostly CGI unlike the original's stop-motion, which was designed and hand-animated by auteur Ray Harryhausen. His creatures had personality and looked cool—the original's Medusa scene was freaky and atmospheric, and her beheading scene was gruesomely cool. In this version, many of the creatures felt generic, were overly CG-looking (where's the dirt?), and there was little tension, including the Medusa scene. Pegasus appears only briefly. There's no Bubo (except for two seconds). Kraken has a newer design now and a bigger sense of scale, but he wasn't particularly engaging as a monster, either. Overall, as a remake, as a 3-D film, and for the possible potential for the material, this film is disappointing. As an action film, it's not bad, even though there's nothing new. There's a mixture of many sources, 'dramatic speeches' we're familiar with, yet very little of the actual good parts were lifted from the original film. It doesn't help that it shares the same title, which would invite comparisons that would make this film seem much worse than it probably is. Had it been a film based or named after a video game—let's say God of War (Playstation)—I might've liked it more. The presentation is helped even less by the 3-D (which I've heard was added later in filming), which is a shame. I strongly suggest watching it in 2-D. Or, better yet, watch the original. Based on the overall experience, I give it * ½ out of **** stars. For more of my article updates, you can follow me on Twitter at http://twitter.com/d_art",5,0,2,2 April 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Movie Review: 'Alice in Wonderland' is a beautiful world to behold
","Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a sequel and not a retelling of the original children's novels by Lewis Carroll. In this film, Alice is now 19-years old, and soon after the death of her father, is proposed to be married away. Feeling pressured, she runs off, following a white rabbit, which leads her to Wonderland, a place she only vaguely remembers from childhood. There, she meets past familiar faces as the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Blue Caterpillar (Alan Rickman), the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), and eventually the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), who has been terrorizing the land with her harsh rule and beheading of heads. Alice finds out that her destiny is to end the Red Queen's rule by slaying the queen's dragon, Jabberwocky, as written in the prophesy. Along the way she meets up with all sorts of colorful characters.If you remember, Steven Spielberg's Hook was the live action sequel to Peter Pan. Similarly, Tim Burton's film is very much like a close cousin, except it's about Alice. The progression of the story is also kind of similar, where the main character, Alice, like Peter, must rediscover herself and finally defeat her nemesis. Likewise, both films are both elaborately staged, they are both about growing up and making choices, and there's a big showdown. Chances are if one liked Hook, one will find many things to like about Alice.Tim Burton's version of the Wonderland's environments are gorgeous, imaginatively created, lots of colorful details, and breathes life. The castles are sleek and intricately designed. The creatures are generally live versions (CG) of the Disney's previous animated version, and they're even more odder and fun to look at. I particularly loved the portrayal of the Chesire Cat in this film, and the way he snakes through midair like water feels very natural, although it wouldn't feel so natural in real life. Only complaint I may have in terms of visuals would probably be where we see CG versions of natural creatures like dogs--they're not particularly stylized so their CG-ness can be more noticeable.Danny Elfman's score fits the environment just right, giving added intensity when needed. This film is essentially Tim Burton's playground and even if there wasn't any story, it still would be plenty of fun to just watch the loony characters in their environment. I will add that 3-D aspect of it helped a lot.Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter with usual gusto, as he brings much energy and quirkiness to such an oddball character. I suppose there is a mix of Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow in there somewhere. Given that other characters are mostly or completely CG, Johnny Depp's character can feel a bit of out of place, as he still feels human. Helena Bonham Carter as the big-headed (literally) Red Queen is fun, expressive, and extremely likable for such a short-tempered character. Mia Wasikowska is particularly noteworthy as Alice, which she plays with free-spirited pluckiness, charm, and beauty.The story, admittedly, is a simple one, although it is to the story's credit that Alice is now an adult--it helps since many happenings in Wonderland can be quite unfriendly, bizarre, and grotesque. Thankfully, no more worries about some dream causing some lifelong trauma to some poor child. I also appreciated the fact that her Wonderland, like dreams, is an extension of her frustrations with the 'real' world, where she felt she had many 'expectations' from outside forces. At the same time, it's not like Where the Wild Things Are, where other characters are actually projections of real-life people from the main character's life. For example, to read Mad Hatter as an extension of her father feels a bit like a stretch, although the Red Queen could possibly represent her future mother-in-law since they both dislike animals. Certainly, one can merely enjoy it at face value and the creativity of this world and be fine with it.Overall, I enjoyed this world of Alice. In one sense, that may be the important thing, if one were to stick to the flavor of the original novel. The story within the Wonderland, I felt, wasn't as poignant as 'real life' moments, which were filmed with much love and detail. Given the fact that original story consisted of series of random events and character interactions, it was nice to see the characters work together a bit. The overall result isn't something beyond what one would expect from this style of work, but it's fun, and where it succeeds, it succeeds well, thanks to the consistency of Tim Burton's imaginative visuals. *** out of **** stars.For more of my reviews, you can follow me on Twitter at http://twitter.com/d_art",8,141,250,6 March 2010
Avatar," Avatar is solid, story needs oomph
","James Cameron's films, many times, have been about humanity's love/hate relationship with a cold-blooded or machine-like opposition. There's machine vs. human conflict in Terminator movies. Insect-like aliens go against humans in Aliens. Titanic was about human technology vs. the harshness of nature, in relations to human pride and dependence on technology. In Avatar, the tribal humanoids of Pandora are the more humane, while the actual humans are more machine-like (in their dependency of technology). His frequent use of a strong female character is also in display here, embodied in the character of Neytiri. And, of course, he loves using the color blue in all his films, and there is a lot of it here, not only in the amazing scenery, but the tribal characters are all blue as well.The story of Avatar is pretty simple and one can pretty much call it an animated version of Dances with Wolves, plot-wise, mixed in with a bit of Princess Mononoke. James Cameron's Avatar makes great use of 3-D technology to bring his fantastic visuals to life. At the same time, I've noticed that humans tend not to look as realistic in 3-D. Perhaps it's from years and years of training our eyes to accept 2-D imagery as real. All the computer generated (CG) characters and places, however, are better enhanced by this 3-D technology, whereas they may not seem as real or convincing otherwise. The colors are brilliant, the details are amazing, and the expressions of the characters are both subtle and spot-on. Does this movie truly innovate the use of this technology? I wouldn't go that far (unlike Terminator 2's use of 'morphing'), but it does show that CG characters can truly flourish, especially with this 3-D medium. If the whole movie was CG with no live action, it would still work quite well (and would be consistent).The human actors do what they can with the amount of live action time given. Most of the time, subtleties feel lost in the realm of live action 3-D. Sam Worthington, admittedly, is more interesting as the blue humanoid, and in this case, perhaps even a better actor because of it. Zoe Saldana (Uhura of Star Trek) plays a CG-fied version of herself as Neytiri. Many character movements have been made with motion capture, and the expressions and movements of Neytiri are full of life and beautiful to look at, which also bring a lot of heart to her character. Rest of the CG characters all come off quite well, and despite the fact that they look a little odd initially, one gets quite used to them and all the creatures in this fantastic world that Cameron has created in great detail. The lighting of the scenes and various plant life and strange creatures all feel like they belong, despite how odd they look—they all move and breathe like real creatures in their own way.One can parallel the film to almost any sociopolitical theme, past and present, that involves people's use of military force for greed of resources and/or destruction of nature. Unlike the humans, the Na'vi in the film are peace-loving people and somehow connects with all of nature harmoniously, and there seems to be something not unlike The Force (from Star Wars) added in there. With all this peace-loving stuff, one wonders how it happens that creatures still viciously eat and kill each other (but I'll leave that alone). Na'vi also have this receptacle thing at the ends of their lock of hair that can connect to and communicate with other animals, who also have a similar receptacle, kind of like a USB port. It's all pretty neat and convenient. Contrast to this, the humans here are not as friendly. Stephen Lang plays Col. Miles Quaritch, a tough, military commander who does whatever it takes to get the Na'vi's to move from their land. Giovanni Ribisi plays Parker Selfridge who spearheads the operation—he's kind of like the greedy lawyer, Burke, from Aliens. Quaritch and Selfridge both are played with a bit of an old-fashioned bad-guy gusto that can come off a bit two-dimensional (to the service of the story). In the end, one will certainly root for the Na'vi—after all, it's their land, they are peace-loving, and the whole planet seems to agree with them.James Cameron is famous for his great action scenes, and seeing how all the creatures move and react and the way CG vehicles crash all feel 'right.' Many directors love to cheese-it-up with tons of explosions and fluid/rubbery/stretchy machines (Michael *COUGH* Bay), but much of that is kept with a bit more restraint. With that said, the film is more of an adventure story than an action flick. Much of the time (the movie is 2 hours, 40 minutes long) is spent allowing us to get to know Pandora and its inhabitants, which fortunately is interesting most of the time.Overall, I found the movie to be quite enjoyable—it may not live up to the hype as the work of great achievement in 3-D, but it's a good achievement. The CG characters fare better than the human counterparts in almost every way, which is both good and a bad thing. We need the humans there to show that we're supposed to accept Na'vi not as a cartoon, but humans aren't as fluid or interesting or real as they are. The lands of Pandora are beautiful, even if it is a little too good (and convenient) to be true. The story, as mentioned, isn't anything new, and dialogue could use a little more edge. Still, the execution is very good, and it is solid visual entertainment. I give Avatar *** out of **** stars.More of my reviews can be found at http://twitter.com/d_art",8,0,2,23 February 2010
Up," A story about death vs. life, young vs. old, personal status vs. personal relationships, inner vs. outer journey, friends vs. enemies. Oh, and it was very good too. :)
","A movie, in a nutshell, about death vs. life, young vs. old, personal status vs. personal relationships, inner vs. outer journey, friends vs. enemies. Oh, and it was very good too. :)Pixar has now made their tenth movie, and still going strong.. and boy, are they! That's 10 for 10, which is an amazing feat. Each of their stories are original, different, and shows us that these guys were not out to merely settle for retreads of the same lessons, formulas, stories, and jokes. Pixar films have the danger of being timeless. In fact, I have a sneaking suspicion they already are! For those who don't know the general story, it's about an old man (who sold balloons) who is about to be evicted, decides that he is better off away, ties tons of balloons to his house and off he goes toward a place in South America called Paradise Falls, to fulfill a promise he made to his late wife. Along comes a kid who hitches along for the ride. To say more would be a disservice to the viewers, as the story unfolds to many great moments, adventures, dangers, and humor.'Up,' as mentioned, is yet another classic, and personally, I felt this movie went boldly beyond what one may categorize as merely kids' entertainment. In fact, there were moments of great emotion that only adults will fully appreciate. Among the Pixar movies, this movie probably moved me the most at a deep, emotional level, which is saying a lot given that it's an animation. They manage to do things with their skillful use of music, imagery, and story, that is both subtle and powerful. There are many things I can say about this movie and how it has many layers and themes and such, but those will be left for discussion boards and essays and talks over coffee.",10,0,2,17 June 2009
Groundhog Day," groundhog has his day....many days
","There are those films after you watch for about 10 or 15 minutes or so, and you realize you are watching something very special and original.  Then, you hope the rest of the movie will equally be as good, if not better, and go beyond your expectations.  Those are times when you see a movie do something very original, and when it succeeds, it's sort of like discovering a diamond in a haystack, or that secret passage behind a bookcase, you basically have no idea what's going to happen next.  It's almost Hitchcockian.  It's a comedy, though.  I had the same kind of thought as I was watching movies like 'Memento' or 'Dark City.'  It's one of those rare gems you don't see often.The idea itself is pretty straightforward.  It's Groundhog Day, and Phil, a self-absorbed newscaster, one day arrives in Pennsylvania for his gig (a place he'd rather not be), and somehow winds up so that he must repeat that same day (literally) over and over again.  As Apollo in Rocky III would say, 'There is no tomorrow.'  Literally. It's basically like time traveling to the same morning right when the day ends.  (Or, to the techno-geeks out there, I suppose it's almost like an 80's text adventure game where you start over after you mess up or die in the game...but much better)This is basically, in my opinion, Bill Murray's best role thus far (To note, I personally thought 'Lost in Translation' was one of the most sleep-inducing movies I've seen -- Wong Kar Wai's 'In the Mood for Love' was similar in that 'subtle-ness' but much better).  As Phil, played excellently by Murray, repeats the same day (Groundhog Day) day after day, he starts to loathe it, then he tries to take advantage of it, using his knowledge to woo women, tries to rob a bank, then not finding fulfillment, starts to loathe his life, and even attempts suicide (to which he wakes up to the same morning he just had).  I must add, whenever I hear the 'I got you, Babe' song, I am reminded of this movie (a song that repeatedly plays in this movie).  There's something very 'groundhoggy' about that music.  What I also like about a film like this is that a character eventually goes through change--he doesn't stay the exact same person as he was.  Phil, for example, eventually learns that he must change inward--obviously, changes he makes outside has no effect to anybody else since it'll be the same day tomorrow. Thus, he uses the time to acquire knowledge, becoming more well-rounded, even become a more loving person (perhaps from that inward change).  In observing, I can say it's amazing what one can do in one day, if one lived one's life to the fullest.   The movie indeed is very funny, if it sounded as if the movie wouldn't be funny.  A lot of that credit can be attributed to the actor, the perfect-for-this-role Bill Murray (especially how he reacts to the situations--at one point he punches a guy he knows he will meet again, yet not know it), the clever writers, and smart direction from Harold 'Egon' Ramis (who also makes a cameo as a doctor).   An excellent film.   Yes, it is kind of like 'It's a Wonderful Life,' if in a more comedic sense.    A smart, very funny movie.  A keeper. 10/10",10,1,3,5 February 2004
How to Train Your Dragon," Examiner Bio Movie Review: 'How to Train Your Dragon' sours, technically and artistically
","The new Dreamworks 3-D (the type with 3-D glasses) animation, How to Train Your Dragon, takes place in a Viking village. Over centuries, man and dragons have been enemies. Dragons kill people, take livestock, and burn their villages, while men have been trained to slay them. Stoick (Gerard Butler) is the leader of the clan, a master dragon slayer, and the protector of the village. To his disappointment, his son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), is the complete opposite of him—timid, scrawny, and more brains than brawn. One day, using his engineering skills, Hiccup manages to capture a very rare type of dragon. Instead of slaying him, Hiccup lets him go and a secret friendship develops between them. Meanwhile, his Dad is also training him to be a dragon slayer.Despite what may sound like the usual generic Hollywood-type plot, the story is quite solid and characters are complex. I was constantly guessing how things were going to end up, despite guessing it'll probably be a happy ending, possibly—there are many ways the film could've gone. There were many rooms for laziness in the plot, but I loved how they didn't do that—things were constantly getting more interesting. The dialogue is very witty, with plenty moments of good irony.The flying scenes are, to put it simply, spectacular. This film shows why 3-D matters and I felt it really pushed the envelope, technically. The 3-D aspect in Avatar was accomplished, but the 3-D truly flourishes in this film. Few films make me feel like I've actually 'been there.' This film does just that. I often worry about 3-D action scenes, fearing speed blurs will make it look odd—no worries here.All the villagers feel real, emotionally, and are quite complex. The voice work by Jay Baruchel and the animation of Hiccup has so much layer and subtleties that I had forgotten I was actually watching animation. Character design-wise, Pixar may still have a slight edge in terms of everything looking 'marketable,' but this is very solid work, and most of all, everything works so amazingly well together—plot, characters, music, and technology. Some of the dragons do indeed look a little odd, but they serve the story. I loved all the adult Viking characters—with their Scottish accents, huge beards, and the big warrior mentality--they're as fun as animation can make them. The relationship between Stoick and Hiccup is poignant, subtle, and more real than many live-action films. Gerard Butler's voice work for Stoick bring a lot of weight to the character.Overall, this film is an amazing showcase for the potential of 3-D. One must think, while 3-D is cool, the whole idea of 3-D is all about 'being there,' it's not about merely watching two people talk, but about audience involvement. It's about going places where you can't go, doing things you normally can't do. I can imagine the application toward video games can be the next big thing. Meanwhile, this film is not only an accomplishment in the use of this new medium, but good story-telling, and fun characters. I give How to Train Your Dragon, *** ½ out of **** stars.For more of my reviews you can follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art",9,2,5,28 March 2010
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Enjoyable Ride. Interesting metaphors
","I quite enjoyed this movie. ^_^ Generally the plot involves a married couple, played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who both happen to have secret jobs as professional assassins on the side without each other knowing (in fact, they each work for each other's rival companies). When they find out they've been deceiving each other, their loyalties are tested, and bunch of stuff blows up as they proceed to kill each other.In a way, it's an interesting, symbolic way of portraying the love/hate tumultuous aspects of marriage relationships. Eventually, they will have to work out their differences and go after a common enemy (or will they?), which is also, by the way, the same plot-line of John Woo's movie The Killer (which had two mortal enemies, cop and hit-man, with a common goal). There's definitely very good chemistry between the attractive leads (Jolie and Pitt) and the way they play off each other (as ridiculous it may be) is playful and endearing. While there are plenty romantic elements, ultimately, it's a movie for action fans, much like True Lies (which also played with domestic humor vs. spy action flick) and there are certainly multiple aspects from movies like War of the Roses (dark humor about marriage gone awry) and John Woo-influenced action spectacles. Doug Liman (who directed Bourne Identity) does a great job of portraying the characters with style, as well as beautifully shot action scenes (complete with an obvious John Woo's 'The Killer' homage/inside-joke near the end of the movie, with the couple, now reunited, storming their way out in visceral, explosive form). Yes, it's ironic and ultimately, entertaining.",9,3,6,27 June 2005
War of the Worlds," A Zombie movie but with war machines... aka. 'It's still better than Jurassic Park2, which isn't saying much'
","War of the Worlds, the Spielberg version, I must add, wasn't one of the movies I was most eagerly waiting to watch this summer (trailer reminded me of some Michael Bay movie). To add, I've already seen the classic 50's version, which I really liked, and didn't think it needed a remake (I sort of have similar thoughts about the upcoming King Kong, but then again, that movie would really test Peter Jackson's skills as a director--it's like redoing Star Wars). Can remakes be good? Yes, if it's more like an adaptation of the original source material (if it's a book) than a remake of a movie version of that material.As mentioned, I did finally decide to watch this film on Sunday evening, after hearing a plethora of poor reviews from friends and critics, knowing that I can now watch it without all the hype and expectations. To add, my friends just wanted to see it (which is usually a good enough reason for me)... AND it was matinée, after all.The movie starts off with the alien invasion (perhaps Martians) on Earth, and with many parallels to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the citizens are attacked unexpectedly, seemingly without reason, by gigantic alien war machines referred to as 'tripods' (they resemble walking tripods with lasers that destroy everything in its path). As destructions ensue, much of the movie is spent around the Tom Cruise's deadbeat dad character and his kids, facing many near misses, and running away most of the time. There are some interesting character developments, however, as Tom Cruise's character do take more of a parental role as the movie progresses. Cruise, despite the fact that he looks a bit too movie-star-ish to play the average joe, does a pretty good job, and the young actors (who play his kids) do their part, as needed, in a movie like this.Meanwhile, as the public is in chaos, normal people start to turn against each other, sometimes killing each other, just so they can survive the massive annihilation. Certainly, the movie does touch upon the darker aspects of human nature (which I found interesting), but just briefly. Majority of the focus, however, is spent on Cruise's plights and the visuals. In terms of look, in the 50's version, we had flying saucers (which indeed looked very alien, cold, sleek, and fairly well-designed, I might add). In comparison, it would've been cooler if the tripods in this movie looked more alien as well--as it is, they look rather retro, metallic, somewhat antiquated (something akin to a steam-engine). The way the machines operate just don't seem as cold and efficient.Overall, I liked the movie for what it was (a chase movie--think 'Zombie movie,' but replaced with gigantic alien machines--though Zombies might've been less costly, and more entertaining). However, there's a bit of disappointment for what could've been. There is certainly a lot of budget to work with here, but they hardly seem to service the story, or enough thrills, for that matter. What's kind of missing is the sense of wonder Spielberg alien films like Close Encounters and E.T. had. There was a sense of mystery and had that other-worldly atmosphere. It's creepy because you're not exactly sure what to think. This movie rather relentlessly throws it all at you. Although I knew how it was to end, the movie's ending felt rather abrupt (without a certain feel of progression) and doesn't really wrap it up as well as it did in the 50's version.Yes, it's kind of unfair to compare this movie to the classic, but that's what one must expect whenever you have a remake. As mentioned, I enjoyed it for what it was, a series of destructions and CG-laden action sequences and the character development is fairly good for the first half of the movie. There are parts that seem longer than it should be (particularly the scenes where Cruise and his kids are hiding in someone else's basement) and parts that don't really amount to much other than serving up for more action. As a Spielberg film, it's not as tight, nor as stylistic, nor satisfying as his previous works. It's still better than Jurassic Park 2, though.(I have heard some rumors that Spielberg didn't get enough time from the studios to really work on it, which might explain why the film felt a bit like it was rushed)",7,0,1,13 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," a nice fill in the gap to the Trilogies
","This movie, I must say, was pretty cool. Of the prequels however, I still must say I found Phantom Menace somewhat most satisfying (despite Jar Jar). Simply put, Darth Maul was just a cool villain, what can I say? I mean you KNEW Obi-wan was in trouble when he faced Darth Maul (even if you knew Obi-wan would win). I just loved those kinds of moments. Anyways, to get back to Episode III, I just love the progression of story and just seeing how Anakin turns to the dark side made a lot of sense. One of the best scenes, oddly enough, was when there were no special effects at all but just seeing two characters (Palpatine and Anakin) just talking. The way Palpatine throws little doubts into Anakin about the Jedi way is just so snakily well-done, I was surprised I was still watching the same movie. And, when that black metal mask finally is placed on Anakin's head, there's a great sense of finality, not only for the Anakin's character, but for the series as well (given the fact this is supposedly the last Star Wars film George Lucas makes -- a blessing or a curse, you decide). I still find the special effects of fully-CG animals rather distracting (as I found in the previous installments, including the revamped original trilogy). They're just way too pretty and fluid and mechanical to be realistic-looking and they never sit still! (wobbly heads are always bad news) But overall, a great progression to the original series and little fan-boy moments that reference Episode IV are quite justified, if not expected.",9,2,6,27 June 2005
Inception," Despite the novelty, 'Inception' gets lost in its own labyrinthine plot
","In this new film directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Dark Knight), Leonardo Di Caprio stars as Dom Cobb, a skilled thief in a world where people can steal secrets from other people's subconscious by entering their dreams by using a machine—this process is called 'extraction.' Cobb, an international fugitive for being a master of 'extraction,' is offered a chance to get his life back if he does one last job for a company, where instead of stealing ideas, he is sent to plant an idea—this process is called 'inception.' Working with a team of extractors to infiltrate a corporate boss's heir, Dom finds this process difficult, as he has to deal with own personal dark memories as well.When I first heard Christopher Nolan was directing a new, original movie, I was very excited. He directed Memento, starring Guy Pierce, one of my favorite and the most mind-boggling cerebral thrillers ever made. He also made that good ol' film called Dark Knight, which broke box office records. His films, often written with his brother, Jonathon Nolan, tend to be multi-layered, challenging, and many times, thought-provoking. He is also a great, visual stylist, as can be seen in the movie. Having seen the movie, and given that this is one of the films where Christopher Nolan wrote without his brother, I think it could've helped with an extra edit to clear up and tighten things up.This film is a visual spectacle, and the special effects are nothing short of breathtaking. Buildings fold on each other like Dark City, characters are tumbling and jumping off walls, and stairs sometimes go on forever not unlike something from M.C. Escher. Many things go on in this film. The fuzziness of reality and memory recalls writings of Phillip K. Dick. There are lots of action scenes. The plot gets convoluted. I felt a slight numbness in my brain keeping track of everything in this movie, as many things are happening simultaneously.One of my favorite parts in the film, and an important subplot, was when Cobb's memory of his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), interferes with his job during a dream sequence, where we get to know more about Cobb's psychology and his darker secrets. Leonardo Di Caprio gives his usual best as the mentally complex Cobb. Marion Corillard is memorable as the figment of his memory of his wife. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is in physical good form as Arthur, who has the world turned upside down on him (literally). The rest of the cast is competent, but we don't really get to know them in a deep level.The problem with the plot for me was the fuzzy nature of the dream-world itself—one can ask many questions that could go on forever. Having been familiar with films like Dreamscape and Nightmare on Elm Street, I have always assumed pretty much everything was possible in a dream world. The dream world in this film is much closer to reality, but I couldn't exactly understand the established limits of possibility within that reality. For example, why can't someone be bulletproof if you know it's a dream? Things get stranger when people enter a dream within that dream using the device--this was the part where the plot got a bit too convoluted for me. In my logic, if a dream is an illusion, an illusion within an illusion is basically the same illusion except it's only making us think it's a different kind of illusion—but, I won't expand on that. Simply put, I think the script should've cleared up better on how dreams operated in this particular world.I might have appreciated this film more on a smaller budget. It could've been a more cerebral film that explored the concepts more deeply than have it covered with action scenes with everything happening in elaborate ways. Similar to how I felt about Steven Spielberg's A.I., the budget appeared to exceed the need of the film's concept, even if the effects were cool. It also reminded me of Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York, a similarly cerebral, yet equally plot-heavy film, about a theater director who creates a life-size replica of New York inside a big warehouse and within that warehouse is another smaller warehouse with a smaller replica, and on, and so forth. Like that film, this film seems to get lost in its excess of plot ideas it wants to explore. Perhaps it might've worked better as a mini-series.Overall, I felt the film could've been tighter and trimmed. There are many action scenes that didn't really contribute to the plot and occasionally seemed to slow down the film, such as the James Bond-influenced gunfight in the mountains. One of the problems about films about dreams is that one assumes a character is never in any real trouble and no action seems extraordinary (while it may be surprising in real life), thrilling, or risky, because it's all 'illusion,' if you will. When the plot had the character go within a dream within a dream within a dream, it was just a bit too much for me. The concept is interesting, and there are certainly no movies like it, but there appears to be an overload of too many things going on.For more of my reviews, you can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art",7,2,5,5 September 2010
Despicable Me," The outrageously visual 'Despicable Me' delivers much fun and heart
","In the CG animation, Despicable Me, a new villain has stolen the Great Pyramid of Giza. Not to be outdone, Gru (Steve Carell), a longtime villain, hoping to uphold his own villainous reputation, plans an even bigger heist—to steal the Earth's moon (with help of a Shrink Ray). In order to do so, he adopts three orphan girls, Margo Edith, and Agnes, to get them to steal the technology from a rival villain, Vector (Jason Segal). However, Gru and the kids start to develop a bond of sorts, which makes him rethink his plans.When I saw this film, it was in 2-D, not the 3-D stereoscopic format, so I will not be able to comment on that particular format. The fluid animation in this film is truly something amazing. This film pretty much proves you can recreate in CG anything a 2-D cartoon is capable of creating (except maybe sketchy lines). The various odd, exaggerated characters with stylized pointy noses, bulging eyes, and expressive mouths that inhabit this zany film are something straight out of TV cartoons-- they all flow, stretch, and exaggerate, all so very organically and naturally. Gone are the stiff-feeling 3-D stuff of yesteryear. The physically impossible feels physically possible because it's so solid-looking. I miss traditional 2-D animation already.I found this film pleasantly charming, cute, diabolically clever, and heartwarming. Admittedly, it is more joke-heavy than plot-heavy. One can easily guess where the story is going and while there are occasional revelations about the characters' past, it doesn't diverge much from the conventional plot. Still, the film's biggest strengths are the outrageous sight gags and the main character, wonderfully voice-acted by Steve Carell. For those who find visually zany gags boring or prefer serious films may find it too goofy for their taste. Still, many adults will find many things to relate to Gru, and kids will relate to the children in the film.Even with his (Eastern European?) accent, Steve Carell's playful humor shines through in the 'despicable' character of Gru. The character never feels stiff nor less than engaging (unlike the recent Shrek Forever After). Gru may be mean-spirited, but in a charming way. Jason Segel has a great time as Vector, the young, geeky, diabolic rival villain who likes to don warm-up suits, whose every body movement is expressively animated and exaggerated. Much of the 'cute' elements come from the three orphan girls (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Elsie Fisher) who truly act like how real little girls act with great subtleties in expressions and randomness. The relationship between Gru and the kids never feels cheesy or manufactured, even if you knew it was coming.I loved the look and design. All the characters, the objects, places, and vehicles in this film feel expressively bold and original. Wacky cartoon physics feel effortlessly and seamlessly applied. I loved the attention to detail in this film. The character expressions are wonderful. It is Pixar-level of detail, which is a huge compliment. The film also doesn't rely too heavily on current pop-culture references, which is a big plus.For a film about a villain, it was strange not to see any 'heroes.' Still, I suppose that could have made the film too complex (that'd be something Pixar would do) and would have interfered with Gru's eventual change of heart in the story. Perhaps they'll explore the idea in the sequel. We the audience love Gru because we know that deep inside he's not really evil—he's misunderstood and probably can be rehabilitated after some therapy.As mentioned, the one complaint, if I were to make one, would be the simplicity of the plot, and this is only if I were to compare the film to Pixar's stories (which is an unfair comparison because the film's main focus is different). Despicable Me's story, in its barest form, could possibly fit into a 30 minute episode. However, everything else in this film more than makes up for it. Sure, it's not as thematically deep or complex as Pixar's work, as I tend to walk away from a Pixar film with always something to think about. While Despicable Me may be more joke-driven, have more slapstick, sight gags, and more interested in 'fun,' with its first rate animation, its crazy humor, its technical achievements, and heartwarming characters, it stands boldly on its own and rivals some of the great CG animations already showcased this year, very closely right up there with Toy Story 3 and How To Train Your Dragon.You can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art for more of my reviews.",8,1,2,5 September 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is cleverly executed
","Based on Roald Dahl's children's novel of the same name, Fantastic Mr. Fox is about a thieving fox named Mr. Fox. Once he finds out his wife is pregnant, he sheds his thieving ways, raises a family and becomes a journalist. However, his old habits don't remain dormant for long and he starts to steal chickens, ducks, turkeys, and cider each night from three mean and wealthy farmers--Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Fed up, the farmers decide to try to ambush him with whatever means possible, which causes a lot of grief for his family and friends.Directed and written (based on Dahl's novel) by Wes Anderson (Rushmore), Mr. Fox has been created in the old school tradition of stop motion animation. While the creatures may not look slick and perfect like CG, they have an infectious charm of looking handcrafted, cuddly, and solid. Their facial expressions and their movements have subtleties that give a human touch you don't get with CG.When I was in elementary school, I recall a time when the teacher read us the book. I remember the story being not too complicated. It did, however, make me want to try apple cider—I loved the way the author described it. Here, the plot, dialogue, and characters have been expanded to create a satiric story full of ironic touches, extra details, and modernized. These details really set the mood. The animals are all fully dressed and talk like adults, about their family issues, mortgages, and life decisions. Mr. Fox's family includes his wife Mrs. Fox, his son Ash, and his overachieving nephew, Kristofferson. The family dynamics are fun and almost sitcom-like. I suppose they could have their own TV show. The animal neighbors of Mr. Fox are equally human in their behavior, with a dash of erratic animal wildness thrown in.The three farmers play the bad guys, and while most humans aren't portrayed as complex as the animals, the meaner characters are presented with flourish. Mr. Bean (I think that was the farmer's name), the leader of the farmers, is lean, sinister-looking, covered in shadows, has a pistol in hand and eerily-lit cigarette lighting his face. The music also plays an integral part in creating various moods of the film, including a zany musical number involving banjos, and occasional retro-style soulful vocals. There are also moments that parody other films, such as West Side Story.Anderson's dialogue is clever, and Mr. Fox is quite the spitfire with words. I bet some kids will find the wordiness a little boring (although amusing for us adults). Nevertheless, it is a fun film, something's always happening, and there's plenty of breezy action. It's definitely a lot lighthearted than Where The Wild Things Are (a fine, analytical film, if not particularly focused for the kids). For those who are purists of the source material, they may find this film a little too smug and Mr. Fox too aware of himself for his own good.George Clooney in the voice of Mr. Fox is a perfect fit—in fact, the role must've been tailor-fit for him. One can't imagine anyone else playing Mr. Fox. Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox and Bill Murray as Badger are fun, and Willem Dafoe as Rat (a villain role) is hilarious. Overall, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fun film that is cleverly written and executed, helped by George Clooney's star power and delivery. For some, it may seem like Mr. Fox is constantly winking at the audience, but even those who may not love the film will still find many things to like about it. I give this film *** out of **** stars.You can see more of my review updates on http://twitter.com/d_art",8,1,3,23 February 2010
The Social Network," Sharp and refreshing, 'The Social Network' has much to Like.
","Directed by David Fincher (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button), with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men) based on a book by Ben Mezrick called Accidental Billionaires, The Social Network is the story of Harvard undergraduate and computer programmer Mark Zuckerberg (Jason Eisenberg), who works on a new idea for a social website with his friend straight out of his dorm room. Called Facebook, it becomes a global social network, garnering 500 million users and making Mark the youngest billionaire in history, while also creating some enemies and legal complications. Right off the bat, let me first say that The Social Network is a well-made film. Director David Fincher's stylistically visual direction, Aaron Sorkin's acerbic dialogue, and Jason Eisenberg's near effortless-seeming performance are what make this film beyond the usual biographical businessman-and-his-dream Hollywood tale. What's unusual about this film's subject is that the main character of this film is to this day, quite young, which also means the story doesn't span a very long period of time. So, a good majority of the film focuses on the details--dialogues, interpersonal relationships, and brain-storming sessions. I take it the main reason for even making a film about this is the fact that Mark Zuckerberg holds the title of being the 'youngest billionaire.' The majority of the film takes place in Harvard, where we see Mark, his calculated personality, his interactions with his friends, and nurturing of his ideas. Jason Eisenberg is able to bring out the nerdy genius of Mark Zuckerberg with spit-fire delivery helped by witty, acerbic dialogue and geek-speak. His performance is convincing and makes it seem like Eisenberg is just playing himself and that he is the genius. Also good is his business-minded best friend, Eduardo Saverin, played sympathetically by Andrew Garfield (reportedly the next Peter Parker in the Spider-Man reboot), the more level-headed of the two owners of Facebook, portraying both the uneasiness and insecurity of being out of the loop when Sean Parker (played smart and confidently by Justin Timberlake), founder of Napster, comes into the picture, wanting to take Facebook to another direction. AdvertisementOn the whole, the story is about how Facebook came to be and the people who created it and people who fought against it. There are some familiar conventionalities in this film like many biographies of this kind, along with greed, sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Structurally, it's nothing new. The story is framed within a meeting between Mark and the people and their lawyers who want to sue him for breach of contract or intellectual theft. We go back and forth between this current event and the past events in Harvard that helped create this popular network. Not unlike Fight Club, David Fincher has a way of making any scene visually interesting. With camera blurs for depth of field, along with his sense of composition and color schemes, he makes scenes feel both surreal and personal. Even the beginning wide-shot credit sequence of Mark walking through the Harvard campus amongst groups of people he doesn't know is interesting in how it visually portrays the whole 'social network' idea. While Zuckerberg is portrayed sympathetically in this film, he isn't particularly seen here as a good guy, either—thus, the enemies. I suppose the irony of the film is how a site that is meant to create friends also created enemies for Mark. I enjoyed the quick-witted dialogue that came out of Mark's mouth. They don't try to dumb down the character for the audience, which is refreshing. To appreciate this film, it probably helps to know how Facebook looks like and how it works. For those who have used it, they know Facebook itself isn't really that complex or new—it's a site that is incorporated in such a way that it's easy, loads quickly, is somewhat safe, and works great with plugins. And, it is, of course, quite popular. There's little doubt there will be some who will be confused by the computer jargon in this film, but they need not worry as it doesn't contribute much to the plot (yet still cool to hear anyway). I wouldn't go far as to say this film defines the modern generation, like some have, which I found to be a strange statement. It is, however, a sharp, nicely-made film, and more refreshing than usual. I'm sure many users will have little problems putting this film on their Facebook's 'Like' list.
