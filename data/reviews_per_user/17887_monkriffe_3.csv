Iron Man 3," The Fall and rise of House Stark
","At the time of first writing, Robert Downey Junior had finished his contract with Marvel Studios, and as yet there had been no announcements that he, or Iron Man will be coming back, beyond a tantalising 'Tony Stark will Return' during the credits. Thus the news that he is coming back for two more movies is a relief, to say the least. RDJ has over the last 5 years strikingly embodied a character fans have been hoping for since the 60s, and made him cool, as well as kicking off Marvel's groundbreaking vision of a cinematic universe that other studios are now rushing to try and follow. Without him, there would not only be no Iron man, but there might not have been an Avengers, either. That said, Iron Man 3 ceases to be simply another superhero movie, and becomes a possible swansong for a cult hero of fans everywhere. Does it live up to the challenge? Hell yes. This is not Tony Stark's finest hour. What it is, though, is his best film to date. As Tony says himself, this is a film about demons, specifically those you create. We open in 1999, pre Tony's weekend away in an Afghan cave and adding a sense of continuity to the trilogy. Tony's casual snubbing of a nerdy geneticist who later becomes a villain is one of the film's few predictable plot points, and Guy Pearce's performance as Aldrich Killian manages to sell the moment. More on him in a moment. Back to Tony. We also meet the bright and innocent Scientist Maya Hansen, played by Rebecca Hall, inventor of a bio virus named Extremis, capable of rewriting human DNA, converting humans into sizzling skin-crawling lava lamps, regenerating limbs, and, um going boom. Snap forward 13 years, and Tony has locked himself in his basement, making a prehensile suit that attaches itself, piece by piece to his body, sometimes with considerable force. His only companions are robots, the social creature seen only 10 minutes previously hiding considerable PTSD with bravado and obsessively creating countless variations on the iron man suit. This self imposed exile is not without consequence. The Big Bad quickly shows himself as the Mandarin, a drawling Ben Kingsley offering anti-Western 'lessons', usually ending with a claim of responsibility for something going boom without a locatable bomb device. After a casual approach leaves one of his friends in a coma and an overly arrogant invitation to his house leaves said house destroyed in an admittedly spectacular action sequence, Stark starts taking the Mandarin seriously, and the rest of the Movie takes off from there. The attack on the Stark Mansion is where we start taking the movie in general seriously as well. The reappearance of Maya coincides with a helicopter attack complete with missiles, explosions, and not one but two of the Stark Family suiting up thanks to the flying Mark 42 suit. Pepper suiting up is one of the many fan services done in this movie, and it is gratefully received. Following this adrenalin fuelled boom- fest, Stark finds himself alone, homeless, and really wishing he'd plugged the Mark 42 in to charge before going out. What follows then is where the movie begins to shine- Stark suit less, alone and working to track down the people behind the Mandarin and take them out for good. Without an Iron Suit Stark resorts to hand made weapons, exploding baubles and the help of a small kid named Hayley, cleverly sidestepping the superhero sidekick cliché with snappy dialogue, and being downright rude, whilst never becoming unlikeable as a character. Quite a feat. From there the plot develops as organically as possible, with so many plot twists that revealing here would spoil the story for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. The fact is, this a story about Tony Stark- not Iron Man, showing that as much as the suits are cool ( and they are- look out for the Mark 42), it's the man inside them, who really has our hearts and this film finally manages to balance some stunning action sequences with some real character development, Dark Knight rises style. Verdict: See it already! While not perfect, and not everyone may agree with Sir Ben Kingsley's portrayal of the Mandarin, this is definitely Stark's best outing yet, and if it had turned out to be the Golden avengers swansong, then he certainly would have gone out with a bang.

Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek Into Darkness Review- some very mild spoilers
","STID (not quite as contagious as it sounds) has often thus far been reviewed in comparison to its predecessor, the admittedly brilliant Star Trek of 2009. This is frequently seen as a trap, so I'm going to try, initially at least to review the movie on its own merits. Here goes.Into darkness opens with a Star Trek equivalent of a Bond movie opening sequence on the beautiful planet Nbiru, grabbing the viewer by the eyeballs as we're forced into watching two separate blistering action sequences involving deep sea diving, an erupting volcano and raiders style alien natives with spears in a crimson forest. It's stunningly beautiful, and the most colourful the film gets for the rest of its considerable running time. It also sets an integral theme for the rest of the movie: Despite the slightly nonsensical plot- quite what Kirk and McCoy were doing in the temple in the first place is never explained- there's enough action and beautiful shots to make you try and forget the need for a plot in the first place. This seems to fade into the background with the start of the movie proper- Abram's' ultra modern London, and the wonderfully tragic background story to an explosive break in at a London Starfleet Archive feel almost like another movie. Kirk's comical side is slightly muted in the face of office politics and an FBI- style briefing on Cumberbatch's character- still at this point in the shadows- until Harrison starts coming out into the open and blowing things up, whilst glaring malevolently the whole time. It's once John Harrison comes onto the stage that the film starts taking off- limited only by the fact that he isn't in it enough. You find yourself rooting for him, more than the Enterprise's crew, who for the most part, with the exception of Kirk and Spock, fade into the background.Kirk's swift off the books chase of Harrison into deep space is fun enough; although increasingly murky due to plot details too spoilerific to go into here. But again, despite the welcome reappearance of familiar enemies on the starboard bow, it's only with Cumberbatch that the film becomes really engaging. His character is constantly evolving, from Sherlock- esque mind games to unfettered brutality in his fight scenes. You find yourself constantly guessing as to which side he's on- but when you ultimately do, well decide for yourselves.In comparison to its precursor, Into Darkness doesn't pull off the slick ride of Star Trek. Neither in story cohesiveness, nor in terms of originality. To its credit, the action scenes are up to the standards of its predecessor, and sufficiently engaging to dispel any growing pedantry over the plot. In fact, it's only really in terms of the story of the film that it falls down. Not in terms of the dialogue, which remains snappy as ever, especially with Scotty, whose depiction by Simon Pegg gets the chance to actually become a serious and integral character, as well as very, very funny. But the plot seems to mutate over the course of the film from an original and engaging adventure to merely a very good remake of a story which was already pretty good to begin with. It's not the execution that bothers me, although one plot line involving a radiation chamber and a tribble could have been done better, but rather that one of the high selling points of Star Trek in 2009 was the promise of originality. The genius of rebooting the franchise in its entirety gave the promise of new, original material. The promise of discovering new worlds and civilisations finally meant something. This makes Into Darkness' decision to turn its climax into a new and perhaps unnecessary twist of a classic Star Trek story ever so slightly disappointing.Verdict: If the above rant hasn't put you off, it's definitely worth a look. There are too many plot twists, some better than others for me to go into too much detail here, so it's worth seeing the film for yourself and forming your own opinion. There's a lot of good stuff here, and the film manages to make even a darkly lit hangar look beautiful. It's just Abrams' decision to try and pay homage to a bygone age which has not quite worked as smoothly as last time round. As the title suggests, the Star Trek franchise is flying into slightly murky territory, but it's still one hell of a ride.",8,7,18,12 May 2013
Man of Steel," Kal-el learns to fly, wear underpants inside his suit and make a good movie
","Man of Steel A scientist on a dying world sends his newborn son into space to escape the impending doom of their planet, sacrificing his life for the chance for his son to survive on a primitive planet orbiting a young yellow sun, a planet most of us may find strangely familiar- most of us know the background to the man in blue. And to be honest, it's never been the most important or integral part of the world's first comic book superhero. Of late, the men of steel's defining features have mostly been the cape, the jaw line, and of course his unique style in underwear. But for this instalment, its all about his origin. Who he is as a character suddenly has less to do with his fashion sense as much as his heritage, the delicate balance he represents between two worlds, and the fact that he is, after all, an alien. And all of a sudden he begins to be less of a gaudy gimmick and once more a character you can invest in, relatable because of his small town upbringing in Kansas, and supportable because of the opportunity for hope he represents. To go into more detail would spoil the film for those who have yet to see it, but suffice to say kal-el's very existence is a source of hope and contention in and of itself. The use of a main character as a macguffin is a shrewd and unusual one, and a defining feature of the film. A Hero as multi-faceted as Henry Cavill's depiction of Kal-el deserves an equal villain. It is a tribute to Cavill's acting and of the character of Kal-el that Michael Shannon's brutish and driven General Zod struggles to keep up with the hero in terms of character. Though not as iconic as the hero of krypton, the good general enjoys a recurring part in the Superman mythos, first appearing in film portrayed by Terence Stamp in Richard Donner's Superman II. Shannon's version takes more emphasis from the status of General, being a more militaristic and brutal commander, seeing Krypton as the more 'evolved' species and thus deserving to colonise the Earth than humans. The principles of evolution, divine right and singular vision of purpose define Zod, the idealism of a zealot driving him repeatedly into conflict with both members of the el family, and it is never clarified whether he genuinely believes in his cause, or simply employs it as affront to cover his barely concealed bloodlust. Although the majority of the film takes place on earth, krypton and its remnants, both technological and living are the focus of the plot. On an aesthetic level, this gives director Zack Snyder artistic free reign to go more or less completely over the top in terms of set design. The opening 20 or so opening minutes on Krypton are an unrelenting sensory assault, bombarding the audience's eyeballs from the logos onwards, as we witness the political and scientific systems of an alien world with a civil war and subsequent apocalypse raging in the background. After the intoxicating rush through a society whose doom is made clear from the very beginning, the visuals step down a pace, becoming more introspective on the details of a more washed out planet earth, causing plenty of artistic possibilities of showing the alien aesthetics infringing on Earth. Having actually seen in some depth the society from which the krypton ships, technology and weapons originate, the juxtaposition of krypton onto earth feels less like a b-movie alien invasion, and more like a jarring clash of two very different cultures. That said, Zack Snyder does channel 50s –era invasion movies at certain points, as well as disaster movies, military conspiracies, and the bonkers apocalyptic imagery that snuck into some of his other prominent works such as Sucker Punch and 300. The mix of genres actually works to the movies benefit, the only issue being when Snyder occasionally starts to go too overboard with the death and explosions. The movie's climax feels a little strained due to the sheer scale of property damage, and you're left wondering whether the director is constantly challenging himself to see how many buildings he can blow up per shot. Perhaps it would be better if the crew gave him less coffee before filming? Whatever the reason, there are certain points where the viewer's personal preference for Snyder's work may influence their opinion more than the story. In any case, the sheer tonnage of destruction may lead to some viewers needing a lie down afterwards. While he can go overboard, the wanton destruction does finally bring justice to the super powered smack downs we've grown to expect from a summer superhero blockbuster. Amid the ethnic morality behind alien cultures and emotional moments, there are lots of pretty explosions to keep your attention from slipping. All in all, Man of Steel is definitely worth seeing. The beauty of a reboot is the ability for new fans that may not be previously familiar with the Superman mythos to be introduced in a newer, shinier way than the fans of yesteryear. For newbies, this is a sleek, glossy sci-fi summer epic, with some serious emotional characters, and a beautiful visual aesthetic. For those who have been fans since the beginning, I would argue this film manages to take a fresh look at a beloved icon, and manages to pay homage to the central ideals of the character, of hope and leading through inspiration with the additional promise of taking the hero in new and exciting directions. 4.5/5",9,8,16,27 June 2013
