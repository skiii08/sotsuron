Captain Phillips," Pirate Movie Poem
","This poem I created expresses my feelings/thoughts after viewing this film. Pirate Movie, 2013, My Take-AwaySeveral Seals shoot three,poor, stoned Somali pirate-fish in a reeled-in barrel to save a Jesusified captain, while a trillion dollar navy's carrier and other billion dollar assets hover near by...... in case help is needed?The world we see is out of whack.Louis the fifteenth has well fortified himself. But starving people,en masse, may freak out may find a (cyber?) chink in this formidable armor.The overly privileged ,who sense not how much they have, may fall to the barely surviving; the grotesquely rich may give way to the galvanized,grotesquely poor. Nature abhors and reframes an imbalance, then starts the race anew with other poor bastard, bandits. desperate to stay afloat.",5,1,3,28 February 2014
